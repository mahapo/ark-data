Our surgical team performed the first two surgeries for removal of objects suspected of be- ing alien im- plants, and then subjected these objects to the scrutiny of both medical and aca- demic science. The results of this initial inves- tigation resulted in shock and at- tention from those within the ufological research field and from the scientific and medical professions. To date ten surgeries have been per- formed, and eleven objects have been re- moved. One of these was nothing more than a mundane piece of ordinary bottle glass. The remainder were all objects of scientific curiosity. No surgeries have been performed since February of 2001. The reasons for this have been two-fold. One is the lack of research funds, and the other is that we have been deluged with other objects of compelling scientific interest related to the abduction phenomena. We have come a long way since our initial beginnings, with the formation of our official non-profit 501 (C) 3 organiza- tion, \"A&S Research.\" This has opened the door to the possibility of acquiring research grants and the ability to accept donations from those who wish to make tax-deductible contributions. It has also forced us to conform to both legal and scientific parameters, such as the formation of our own Science Advi- sory Board, which is composed of some of the top scientists in the world. Because of the changes made, we have been allowed through some of the doors that were previously closed to us, and have been working with some of the top international scientists. I was also invited this year, as an A&S representative, to attend the meeting of The Society for Scientific Exploration, held in Paris, France, and felt it was an honor for me to be there. We have also been working closely with The National Institute for Discov- ery Science (NIDS), which has assisted us with funding and scientific support. The lessons learned have been many, and I shall illustrate some of them in describ- ing the subject case within this text. The case of the \"claw\" One of the many cases that intrigued us pertains to an ongoing abduction case that originally started in Bakersfield, CA. Many who have heard me lecturing in person or on the radio will be familiar with the Gary Lowery Case. We believe this case to be one of the most credible cases, with an over-abun- dant amount of physical evidence on record. Gary and his family have been involved for many years with numerous conscious memories of actual experi- ences. From the onset, I perceived Gary as an honest individual who was sincere in his beliefs. Gary has undergone lie-de- tector examinations, and passed with fly- ing colors. He has also undergone at least two regressions, one performed by a con- sultant in stress management and the other by Budd Hopkins, who found Gary very credible. Initially Gary suggested to me he was going to try to capture his experiences on video. Fortunately he did not follow my advice, as I had told him that previ- ous attempts by individuals to film these creatures were all unsuccessful, and I thought, frankly, that he was wasting his time. However, Gary proceeded to install a video camera in a clock radio in his bed- room, and began recording the events oc- curring during the night. Over a period of time he collected a voluminous amount of video material and then slowly began to examine the footage. He painstakingly reviewed the mate- rial in normal time and in slow motion for hours and hours, sometimes looking at a frame at a time. This resulted in his find- ing some very unusual images. He con- tacted me again and explained what he had found. He offered to send me some of the examples of the video, and I ac- cepted his offer. In turn I sent the material out to sev- eral video analysts, and they concurred with Gary's findings. There was evidence of some kind of an image showing a crea- About the author Dr. Roger Leir is a podiatric surgeon who has been in private practice in Ventura, CA, for more than three decades. His first book, The Aliens and the Scal- pel, described his early work with \"im- plants.\" He later wrote an update for sale in Brazil entitled Implantes Alienigenas. Dr. Leir is also the author of Case Book: Alien Implants. Dr. Leir has written nu- merous articles, and has appeared on both radio and TV. He has been active with MUFON, and was a pesenter at the 2001 MUFON International Symposium. ture in the film. In future efforts with spe- cialized equipment we were able to split the video frames into two video fields. This doubled the amount of visual infor- mation, and we were able to discern other spectral phenomena occurring in his house, such as balls of light floating through the air. His next endeavor was an attempt to collect footprints of the Beings coming through the wall of his bedroom closet. He used a bath towel, the same color as the rug, and laminated a piece of thick tin foil onto the reverse side. That night he placed the towel down on the rug in front of the area where he had seen these creatures come through the wall. The following morning he found two footprint impressions in the tin foil. He used plaster to cast the impressions, which produced a positive image of the foot. I examined both the impressions and the casts. The feet were unlike human feet, in that they were small and quite nar- row through the mid-foot and arch area. The foot then extended into a three-toed structure, unlike human toes in that they were wide and apparently fleshy. Additional evidence During the months that followed, I made numerous trips to Gary's house to examine some of the physical evidence. I collected samples from fluorescent areas on the walls of his closet and bedroom. In addition, soil samples were taken from his front yard which showed a cir- cular area of lawn where nothing would grow. This was the shape consistent with a circular craft landing area. In addition, I discovered magnetic anomalies involving two exterior walls of December 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the house. Inside his bedroom closet were additional magnetic anomalies involving all the metallic coat hangers. Also, two of the metal closet door hinges demon- strated magnetic anomalies. A compass needle would turn 90 degrees away from the hinge, indicating a repulsion force with a lack of an opposite pole. In addition, he presented me with a wristwatch which had been mysteriously missing over a two-week period, then turned up covered with a grayish pow- dery residue. There were numerous other physical anomalies of scientific interest. . During the time when Gary was col- lecting evidence of footprints, he noticed one morning what appeared to be a small blackish object stuck in one of the loops of the bath towel. Both he and his wife agreed that this object was not in the towel the night before. The towel had been freshly laundered when placed in position. The object ap- peared to be the shape and size of a \"claw.\" Was it possible that some alien creature could have come through the wall of his closet and lost an appendage? When Gary notified me of his find, I was both skeptical and excited. When I examined the object, I also saw what ap- peared to be a \"claw,\" just as Gary had indicated. I considered the possibility that this could be one of the most significant pieces of physical evidence involving any alien abduction case on record. Testing the \"claw\" Thus began one of the most vigorous scientific pursuits involving physical evi- dence in the field of ufology. The object was first examined by the Department of Zoology at the University of California at Berkeley. The head of the department was a Ph.D. zoologist whose specialty was reptiles. He indicated he could not identify the species from which this object had come. A second specialist was called upon to identify the object. This was a specialist in primate zoology at the San Diego Zoo. She also was unable to determine what primate could be involved. At this point I was becoming increas- ingly more convinced we had our hands on an extraterrestrial biological object. If this was true we would be able to tell the world we had \"smoking gun\" evidence. Next the object was sent to my very dear friend and scientist Bill Mallow at Southwest Laboratories in San Antonio, TX. He examined the object and deter- mined the most superficial aspects ap- peared to be a vegetable layer. In a telephone conversation, I ex- plained to him I thought this was not un- .usual, as many claws or nails are infected with fungus, and this would explain the vegetable coating. He agreed with my theory and told me he would proceed to look at the deeper layers. His final report stated the \"claw\"con- tained a layer of material composed of keratin, the same substance found in hu- man nails [as well as in horns, hoofs, claws, bills, etc.], and sent me FTIR data. At this point there was no question in my mind about what had to come next. It had to be DNA analysis. Funding came from several sources. Some of these were from dedicated and generous individuals such as Bob and Zoe Hieronimus. Other funds came from individuals who put forth private funds. Others were contributions from the entertainment industry. Fortunately I was able to get one of the most important and well-respected genetic scientists to spearhead the project. One of his requirements was that his name not be used. Once these agree- ments were made, the initial DNA study began. Startling data Within a short period of time, data be- gan to arrive. It was startling, as it indi- cated the DNA was unlike anything from this earth. At that point 1 was warned by the genetic researchers not to discuss these findings with anyone outside the group. They felt these findings were so earthshaking that everyone involved with the project could be in danger from those who did not want this information made public. Although I did not understand the full implications of their statements, I readily agreed to comply with their wishes. I was also advised it would be wise to bring in outside assistance to further the research. I brought the initial scientific data to the National Institute for Discovery Sci- ence (NIDS), as I had worked with them in the past, and we still maintained a very good relationship. Once they accepted the project, I was advised to remain si- lent, not only about the project, but the Lowery Case in totality. Later I came to understand the reasons for this request, and today I thank all in- volved for their very solid advice. Now, with retrospective thought, I can see the possibility of what might have happened if our genetic research was incomplete or wrong and an article had been published in a peer-reviewed genetic journal. What fools, both NIDS and my orga- nization, A&S Research, would have ap- peared to have been. All credibility would be lost for future research. So I sat qui- etly by and let the scientific investiga- tion take its course. During a final meeting of all involved parties, plans were carefully made as to how to proceed with the publication of an article. We agreed that additional data had to be sought from outside laborato- ries, since we did not want to take a chance of bringing erroneous data to the fore- front of the genetic community. We couldn't take the chance of being wrong. What we deemed necessary was con- firmatory data. Next we strategized as to how to handle the criticism, which was undoubtedly going to come following publication. Final plans were set in place. A new technique Fortunately, shortly after this meeting our initial genetic scientist developed some new original techniques in genetic Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal December 2003"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"research. He began to involve the RNA, the precursor to DNA. As a result of his findings with these newly developed techniques, we were notified he had found a match in the genetic database. Stunned by the results There was an indication our specimen came from a species of mollusk. We were all stunned. After all this work, could our specimen not be a \"claw\" at all, but noth- ing more that a common terrestrial mol- lusk? To confirm these findings we con- sulted a Ph.D. scientist specializing in the field of gastropodology, the study of slugs and snails. From the photos of the object he was able to identify the animal even before we sent him the DNA data. Our so-called non-terrestrial \"claw\" was indeed a very terrestrial slug. One might ask why the primary DNA studies led us erroneously to conclude the DNA was non-terrestrial. The answer is quite simple. Mollusks secrete a substance which is used as a defense mechanism. This substance contains enzymes that result in the fracturing of DNA chains. When looking for DNA identification we found only incomplete DNA chains, which wouldn't match anything in the database. In addition, what we believed to be hairs growing out of the object were so- lidified secretions from a specialized set of cells called gastro cysts, resembling hair. In addition, the findings that indicated a possible similarity to the keratin sub- stance found in human nails was also er- roneous, due to the nature of the animal's outer protein shell. Unanswered questions Do these findings invalidate this ab- duction case? The unqualified answer is an emphatic NO. Do we have the an- swers? Again the answer is NO. The \"claw\" is only one portion of this case currently under investigation. It was given priority considering the importance of the possibility of finding non-terres- trial DNA. What we are really left with are more questions, such as: 1. How did this slug get into the towel in Gary's closet when both he and his wife state the towel was freshly laundered the night before? 2. How was this animal mummified to the state in which it was found, when re- cent studies demonstrate that drying the animal results in powdering and not so- lidification? 3. The time factor involved for this state of mummification also remains a mystery. Further scientific discussion leads us to believe it would take a much longer time than 24 hours for this to oc- cur. 4. The closest associated type of ani- mal found in the Genbank indicates its origin is New Zealand. The second clos- est association is a Sea Slug. The ac- cepted explanation for this is the lack of data in the Genbank pertaining to all Cali- fornia slugs. However, we have recently learned that there are no slugs in the Bakersfield, CA, area that match the de- scription of this animal. Future research A&S Research was exposed to the Lowery case approximately eight years ago. We have determined that this case has an abundance of additional physical evidence that remains to be examined: 1. Alleged anomalous magnetic or elec- tromagnetic phenomena involving the en- counter site. 2. Soil taken from the front yard in- volving possible landing traces. 3. Powdery substances covering a wristwatch. 4. Samples of fluorescence taken from the walls of the closet and bedroom. 5. Footprint castings. 6. Anomalous video footage. 7. Wound analysis of body marks as well as physiological testing and blood analysis. 8. Analysis of the ambient background involving temperature fluctuations, elec- tromagnetic anomalies, and light and sound affects. 9. Infrared photography. A learning experience What can be learned from this exer- cise in academic, scientific research? In my opinion one of the most important les- sons to be learned is simply that of pa- tience and to follow the science. The his- torical record demonstrates most of the research done in specific areas of phe- nomenology, such as in the UFO field, is not scientific. There is an unfortunate trend for many well-meaning researchers to rush and bring their conclusions before the gen- eral public through radio programs and other publications without adequate sci- entific proof. Jumping the proverbial scientific gun only succeeds in generating an abundant amount of publicity for the researcher, but contributes absolutely nothing to the overall value of the work. I must admit that in the past I also have been guilty of this same faulty expressiveness. One of the criticisms of my work is the lack of publication in peer review scien- tific literature. I accept this criticism, but this did not occur without my efforts to correct this fault. I am still trying to ac- complish this, but so far have not been successful. This project was costly and took al- most two years, but has yielded hard con- clusive facts. To some, the result may seem disappointing, but to others who respect the validity of true scientific en- deavor, it will be deemed a great contri- bution in understanding just a very small part of the UFO phenomena.

I also was disappointed that Stan's subtle and not so subtle wielding of ad hominems managed to slip past your edi- torial scrutiny, especially in an issue in which John Schuessler unequivocally declares, \"We do not condone personal attacks on individuals for any reason.\" Then there are the irrelevant facts made to seem relevant. But enough. Recog- nizing the futility of engaging in a verbal ping-pong match in your pages, I recom- mend readers of the Journal read our ar- ticle and judge for themselves, rather than taking Stan's word on it. -Karl T Pflock, Placitas, New Mexico Stan replies: I certainly hope that everyone reads .the original IUR article in addition to my column. That is why I referenced it. The biggest ad hominem attack is the strong implication, based on no evidence at all, that Barney Barnett made up a phony story which he told to Ruth's niece, to the young Maltais, to his boss, to neighbor Harold Baca (who came over to get him up from where he had fallen), and to a military officer whose credentials he asked for before saying anything. The IUR article is based on the false assumption that absence of evidence is evidence for absence, and that any sce- nario, no matter how baseless, is better than none, so long as it gets rid of the Plains of San Augustin case. - Stan Friedman December 2003 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Studying a California site from afar California, Michigan, Canada crop circle investigators utilize innovative collaboration Editor's Note: This report describes the use of electronics to enable investi- gators not physically present at a site to help investigate that site—something which can perhaps have expanded usage in all types of investigations. In addition, this investigation of an insectoid-shaped crop circle uncovered the presence, for the first time in Cali- fornia, of the European Corn Borer. Thanks to Michigan MVFON for alert- ing the Journal to this activity. By Jeffrey Wilson T he recent discoveries of several crop circle formations in Solano County, CA, have initiated sev- eral interested investigators into the sci- ence of investigating crop circles. As is typical of many new investiga- tors, they inevitably reach out to others in the crop circle research community for guidance, and this new group of re- searchers in California did so in an un- precedented, innovative way. On July 16,2003, after several e-mails back and forth between crop circle re- searchers in Michigan and California, Steve Moreno, director of PsiAppfica- tions in Fairfield, CA, offered to provide a live broadcast from the recently dis- covered Vacaville, CA, \"insectoid\" crop circle formation as a way to collaborate on the investigation of this crop circle in a corn (maize) field. Of course the Michigan researchers accepted this exciting offer immediately! Knowing that crop circle investigations need to be done sooner, rather than later, we hastily arranged a date and time for this broadcast. On July 17,2003, Steve Moreno and I did a \"dry-run\" and tested the technol- ogy and methodology we would use for this unprecedented type of investigation. Steve, in California, would use a video camera to record the images directly into a computer, which would then be sent through the Internet using Yahoo Mes- senger. We would also be in contact via phone. We managed to work out a few techni- cal difficulties, and proved that the sys- tem could work. We decided to carry out the investigation the very next day. I then sent out a number of invitations The Vacaville, CA. crop circle in corn. (Photo by Brad Zweerink. Media News Group.) to crop circle researchers in the United States and Canada who we knew had ex- perience in investigating corn crop circle formations, and who we had been in con- tact with about the Vacaville formation already, to join us for the world's first In- ternational Tele/Video Investigation (TVI) of a crop circle formation. The plan was to have Steve and his team of researchers broadcast live video through the internet from the Vacaville formation while we were simultaneously on an audio conference call beginning around 7 PM EDT/4 PM PDTon Friday, July 18. All the researchers contacted ex- pressed excitement and willingness to participate in this unique collaboration, although not all of them could arrange to participate on such short notice. On July 18, 2003, Steve Moreno; Reuben Uriate, MUFON State Director for Northern California; and Alan Weiblen, PsiApplications Executive Assistant, went to the Vacaville site, braved the 100- degree-plus afternoon heat, made their way through the thick com foliage, ar- rived inside the formation, and began to set up their equipment. They wired their video camera to their .laptop computer, then wired up a cell phone to broadcast wirelessly to the Internet using Yahoo Messenger. Although Yahoo Messenger has both video and audio capabilities, they re- stricted their wireless broadcast to video images only in order to use all (he avail- able bandwidth for the video stream. They used a second cell phone to be in audio contact, and contacted us in Michigan right on time. At my home in Dexter, MI, Dr. Charles Leitzau, MUFON consultant, and myself parked ourselves behind my computer-each of us with a wireless phone in hand, waiting for the first video broadcast. In Wixom, MI, Todd Lemire, the Chief Investigator for Michigan MUFON, also was at his computer waiting to receive the video broadcast and my narration via Yahoo Messenger. In Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Mike Bird, MUFON Ontario Provincial Direc- tor and Canadian Crop Circle Research Network (CCCRN) member, also joined us (after about the first hour-he needed to solve his own technical problems) to re- ceive the broadcast, while also on three-way audio conference call, relayed through my phone in Dexter. The California researchers encoun- tered a few technical difficulties in the field to begin with (which, I stress, was NOT due to any anomalous energies from the formation), but at 8:25 PM EOT/ 5:25 PM PDT, they solved the issues, and the live Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal December 2003"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"video feed from the Vacaville crop circle formation commenced. The era of Tele/ Video Investigations (TVI) of crop circles has now begun! The battery power in the cell phones and the computer gave us about two hours worth of connection time, and we managed to accomplish several worth- while results in that limited time. Here, I want to quote Dr. Charles Leitzau, because he has outlined the spe- cific scientific observations and experi- ments done collaboratively through this first TVI: \"Dear Friends, \"I am still so amazed at what we ac- complished in our spirit of open coop- eration yesterday that I cannot find any words to express its profound signifi- cance,, which goes way beyond just the creation of a new application for cutting edge technology. \"This is my first piece of feedback for those involved. However, aside from the valid scientific discoveries, the amazing example it sets for the synergistic multi- plication of progress through free col- laboration demands that we share the knowledge of our achievement even be- fore we have finished the project and ana- lyzed all the data. \"For those of you learning of this for the first time, the logistics of this accom- plishment are relatively simple. \"Using video and wireless web tech- nology through the medium of Yahoo, combined with wireless and landline tele- phone conferencing, a group of seven diverse investigators spread over two states and Canada, thousands of miles apart, collaborated to carry out a \"real time\" field investigation of the famous, Vacaville, CA, \"insectoid\" com (maize) formation. \"I do not intend for this to be a \"news release,\" therefore more specific details will, no doubt, be presented by others in the group. However, this is my first op- portunity to share some of the concrete, scientific results which we accomplished. \"The Vacaville field and video team consisted of Steve Moreno, Ruben Uriarte, and Allen Weiblen, representing several different research groups, includ- ing Psi Applications and MUFON. \"They broadcast images over Yahoo from within the formation, demonstrating observations they had made themselves, and carrying out specific investigations resulting from continuous, simultaneous, conferencing with the entire group. \"Communications on this end were co- ordinated by independent investigator Jeffrey Wilson from his home in Dexter, MI, where I, Dr. Chuck Lietzau, joined him as part of the scientific analysis team. \"Mike Bird, representing the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network as well as MUFON, was on a direct phone link from Toronto, where he was also able to re- ceive the video from Vacaville and be an active part of the collaboration about spe- cific activities for the broadcast team to carry out by phone. \"Chief MIMUFON Investigator Todd Lemire, following the video at his home in Wixom, MI, shared his expertise through the use of both a \"chat window\" and his \"streaming video,\" which was also on-screen. \"Together, the diversity of abilities and spectrum of personal experiences with similar formations that we were able to share, coupled with video and voice com- munication in response, allowed us to conduct a more perceptive preliminary examination, ajong with some conclusive scientific analyses, than would have been possible by any one team alone. \"Other investigators in the forefront of crop circle research were invited, but were unable to join us. And that is my real purpose for this message. Valid sci- entific research is exciting, but tedious and time-consuming. \"This part of the collaboration is still ongoing. While it may involve another collaborative \"Tele/Video Investigation,\" we have found that scientific measure- ments of valid samples is perfectly pos- sible using scanned images that include a metric ruler. This will eliminate the time delay involved in shipping the numerous samples required. \"A single, two-hour 'TVI,' such as we carried out, represents only a fraction of the time required to plan and carry out the acquisition and measurement of rel- evant samples, but does represent the all- important 'preliminary survey,' which helps to set the course of further investi- gation. \"Even so, and despite the ever-present technical difficulties, which were NOT related to energy-interference within the formation, we were able to make some firm conclusions, including a sta- tistically valid scientific investigation. \"My hat goes off to the intrepid crew in Vacaville, who entered the field by climbing a ditch in the near-hundred-de- gree sunlight, then, as they left in the gathering darkness, found themselves confronted by a now water-filled moat.\" Every fact must be validated and taken into account. Early on, it may not be pos- sible to know specifically what will prove to be crucial in the course of ongoing in- vestigations to ultimately determine the authenticity of the formation. The findings A. The density of moths in the formation's first two circles is signifi- cantly greater by a factor of 17 times than that in the standing crop surrounding the field. This is determined by the analysis of specific \"walking transects\" which com- pare equal areas of the \"left antenna,\" \"head,\" 1st pathway, and second circle combined, with surveys taken in the standing crop which appropriately match area traversed and location. This could not have been designed and carried out without the TVI collabo- ration. The local California Dept. of Agri- culture has speculated that this forma- tion may represent the first known occur- rence of the European Corn Borer in California's history. It is a moth common out East and en- countered in the Fremont, MI (near Hem- lock) maize formation here last year, the larvae of which bores recognizable tun- nels in the maize stems, sometimes caus- ing the stems to break at the site. While there may be possible natural causes for the presence of moths in the formation, their distribution is an ANOMALY until further explained. If the larvae were pupated in stalks that were downed, they may have been exposed to greater heating by the sun, resulting in earlier emergence. It may be natural for the adults to con- gregate in open areas to mate. However, if this were the case, there most likely would have been a greater number of adults in the standing crop with their den- sity increasing towards the formation. Instead, they were almost totally absent from the standing crop. Another possibility is that the larvae or pupae in the stems of the formation plants may have had their life cycle ac- celerated by the effects of the energies involved in an authentic circle's forma- tion. Further investigation will be necessary to choose among these or other hypoth- eses should the distribution of the moths prove crucial to the determination of the formation's authenticity. B) Even though the European Corn Borer was present, their larvae are not responsible for downing the plants in the formation.

These may put out new prop roots at the first few nodes along the horizontal length, and then begin a quick recovery to upright position about the 4th node from the ground. 2) Plants vertical to a higher node, such as the third from the ground, where the upper stalk is \"severed\" across the middle meristematic plane of the node, but continues to remain attached and dangling by a few fibers. 3) Plants similar to \"2\" above except that the upper portion is completely \"sev- ered\" and absent from connection to its lower stalk. See \"D\" below for special significance. D) Many downed formation plants are vertical to a higher node, such as the third, where the upper portion is com- pletely \"severed,\" and completely miss- ing from the vicinity. (Verified by on-site and on-screen collaborative analysis.) In one specific trial, one of the on-site field team members was directed to use himself as the center of a sampling circle of 5 feet diameter and individually docu- ment each severed plant within this sample area. All \"severed\" plants in this sample quadrat were separated at the middle of the third node from the ground. In 4 cases, the severed portion was still present, barely attached to the lower, up- right stalk by a small number of fibers. However, in 8 cases in which the stalk was completely severed, the missing por- tions of the stalk were completely absent from the vicinity. The litter on the ground consisted only of dried leaves from this year's crop and one extremely weathered cob from last season's crop. The upper portions of these 8 plants, consisting of an estimated length of 3 through 5 feet each, were apparently re- moved from the site. This sample scien- tifically verifies the anecdotal reports in newspapers that many, perhaps several hundred, stalks are completely missing without a trace. (Scientific report prepared by Chuck Lietzau, MUFON Consultant.) As Dr. Leitzau has concisely re- counted, several scientifically verifiable results were obtained in this initial TVI, which I would like to elaborate on. The C A researchers reported that they had seen these moths only inside the for- mation, but not while walking through the field, so we had them test their observa- tion. Again, as Dr. Leitzau recounted, there was 17 times the number of moths in the formations' first two circles as com- \"Cut\" corn stalks not caused damage. (Photo by Mike Miley.) pared to outside the formation in the standing corn. Why from only the first two circles? As the California researchers reached the third circle, they reported that it had been flooded-the field's irrigation system had been turned on. They decided wisely not to press on at that point. As Dr. Leitzau also noted, this resulted in the CA researchers encountering a water-filled irrigation ditch when they ex- ited the field-which had been dry when they entered two hours before. The mention of the corn borer comes into play here because this insect has been suggested in past corn crop circle investigations as a possibility for how the stalks of corn are cut, broken, or flattened. But this was verified through careful ex- amination NOT to be the case at the Vacaville site. The identification of multiple mecha- nisms of damage to the corn stalks is nec- essary in order to explain the creation of the circles and pathways of this forma- tion. It is important to note that this var- ied damage (flattened, but not otherwise damaged, and continuing to grow; sev- ered stalks which are barely still attached; and completely severed stalks) occur al- most uniformly throughout the entire for- mation. That is to say that in any given area of the formation you can find any of the 3 mechanisms, some side by side. Almost all the severed stalks were measured to have been \"cut\" at 9 inches from the ground (although the range was from 7-10 inches), and all at the third growth node. This \"severing\" of stalks is not a new phenomenon. Paul Anderson, director of CCCRN, contacted me after I reported this detail on CropCircleNews.com, and said he had seen this same anomaly in two corn crop circle formations he inves- tigated near Mission, Brit- ish Columbia, Canada, in the fall of 2002 (http:// www.cccrn.ca/intro.htm). Last summer, on the cam- pus of Fresno State Univer- sity, in California, a 125-foot long formation in corn also had \"cut\" or \"severed\" stalks in it, although univer- sity officials wouldn't allow any outside researchers to conduct any investigations there (http://www.fresno- statenews.com/2002/Au- gust/CropCircles.html). by insect Back in April of this year, a \"T\"-shaped formation was discovered near Defi- ance, MO, in a dry lake bed full of tree saplings. The saplings had been cleanly severed by some unknown force (hftp://www.ctheatre.home- stead.com/treeTDeflance.htmi). As has been reported elsewhere, and also by these California researchers (veri- fied via the TVI), is that much of the sev- ered stalks/plant material in this forma- tion is missing-the stalks are just not to be found-possibly as much as 40-60 % of the stalks in the affected areas. This was found to be the case by the first in- vestigators on the scene. To give you an idea of how much plant material that is-this formation is 569 feet in length, the six circles range from about 87 feet in diameter to about 23 feet in di- ameter, and the pathways are as long as 86 feet. This is the largest com crop circle on record in either the USA or Canada. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of stalks missing. Also, to give you an idea of where in the field the formation is located, we also timed how long it took the California in- vestigators to walk from the formation to the closest exit point of the field: 8 min- utes. The window of time of this formation's appearance has also been narrowed down to a short 4.5-hour time frame. At the nearby Nut Tree Airport, the administra- tive secretary stated that she, two other PageS MUFON UFO Journal December 2003"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"pilots, and her daughter flew over this field at 2:15 PM on the Sunday (July 6) this formation was discovered by Blue Ridge Aeronautics pilot Lou Tobin at approximately 6:45 PM. She and her daughter stated emphati- cally that \"it was not there\" at 2:15 PM, because they live across the street from the field, and they always look down to find their house as they fly over the area. This narrows the event date and time to this 4.5-hour window during the hot- test part of the day, in which tempera- tures easily reach 110 degrees and more in the field. This gives rise to another anomaly in the formation: that much of the plant ma- terial, especially the leaves on the ground inside the formation, was found to have turned brown and was dry or de- hydrated when the formation was first investigated, creating the initial impres- sion that the formation had been.there for possibly a couple of weeks: But the eyewitnesses have clearly shown this not to be the case. Steve Moreno astutely pointed out that on the north side of each circle and the pathways the first 5-6 rows of stand- ing corn adjacent to the downed corn was \"bowed\"-mbst severely the closest to the flattened corn; less \"bowed\" the farther away the standing corn was-and was more extreme in the smaller circles. Mike Bird, from Toronto, added that he had seen a similar effect in a 99-foot long, dumbbell-type corn circle formation near Orilla, Ontario, Canada, in Septem- ber of 1993. He reported that the western side of the perimeter of the formation had a \"shifted\" type effect, like a \"wake\" or wave-like effect going out into the stand- ing corn for several rows. The California researchers have re- corded this event for posterity, and we have agreed to plan a second TVI in the near future to continue the investigation. As Dr. Leitzau said, this is just the first phase of the investigation of this forma- tion. This technological experiment has turned out to be a very positive collabo- rative experience that hopefully will set a precedent for crop circle investigating! This first international attempt at TVI from a crop circle formation was nothing short of an exciting, incredible success! A huge thank you to Steve Moreno for suggesting the TVI idea and provid- ing the lion's share of the technological equipment, and to Reuben Uriate and Alan Weiblen for helping to operate the equip- ment and being our \"tour guides\" in this formation. Woman in Canadian encounter continues to have health problems By Brian Vike Director, HBCC UFO Research O ne woman involved in the July 31,2003, UFO encounter, miss- ing time, apparent abduction, and physical injuries at Kelowna, B.C., Canada, (see October, 2003 Journal) has continued to have medical problems. \"Linda\" (a pseudonym, also known as \"Cynthia\") continues to have a con- stant feeling of pressure on her head and is becoming worse as the days and weeks go by. This feeling of pressure has now moved into her neck. On Nov. 8, Linda, while at her home, became very cold, as her body tempera- ture dropped to 35.2 C. She immediately called the hospital and talked to a nurse who informed her that it sounded like hypothermia was setting in. The color of Linda's skin started to change, becoming almost whitish/grey. She was freezing to the point where she felt paralyzed and had major problems moving or walking. Cynthia's temperature dropped a little over 2 degrees, and no explanation has been given as to what has caused this to happen. I tried to find out if abductees have even experienced hypothermia after an encounter, but after searching and read- ing all kinds of material and contacting both researchers and abductees, I came up with nothing. Some abductees report feeling very cold leading up to the actual abduction, also feeling very cold just af- ter it took place. Many report a coldness when inside a craft to the point they were shaking. If anyone and has ever experienced hypothermia after an abduction would contact me, I would really appreciate hear- ing from you. Linda's heart was also beating really irregularly, and she reports it was down to 44 bpm. Her daughter is also experi- encing an irregular heart rate as well. On Saturday night, Nov. 8, Linda's daughter, who has also been the victim of unwanted visits by beings from else- where, went to bed, and after a short pe- riod of time started having an unusual and vivid dream about being in some type of vehicle with two beings. She felt that they were there to take her somewhere. The young girl felt that wherever they were going wasn't the place to be. So in her \"dream\" she jumped from the vehicle and landed on the ground, hit- ting her right leg and rolling along the ground for a short distance. She woke up the next morning, Sunday, Nov. 9, with extreme pain in her knee. Actually, as she climbed out of her bed her leg folded up right underneath her. She was fine the night before, and hadn't been involved in anything which may have caused the injury. Yet the cartilage in her right knee is ripped and torn, and she has to be on crutches for awhile until it heals up. Some- time after they left the doctor's office the pain moved up into her thigh, and is get- ting worse. Linda is taking her daughter back to the doctor or the hospital to have her checked out again. Linda told me that blood tests will be done in hopes of determining what caused the drop in her body temperature, and to see if there are any problems de- veloping with her daughter. She also mentioned that both she and her daughter are craving salted products and are extremely thirsty. Both mother and daughter are totally exhausted, as if the two of them hadn't slept for days. I just had an email from a lady who resides in Vernon, BC. She has informed me that a couple of business owners were in Kelowna, BC, on Nov. 8, the day that Linda first felt extreme cold, and the night her daughter's leg was injured. They watched green lights in the southwest skies over Kelowna. I hope to have a full report on the sighting of the green lights. Also I want everyone to know that no information had been given out to any- one about what took place on Nov. 8 with Linda and her daughter. So again we have green lights showing up and strange events taking place. I telephoned Linda on Nov. 17 to see how both she and her daughter were feel- ing. She sounded extremely tired, as though she had no energy even to carry on a conversation. There is also more which has taken place, but due to this information being of a personal nature, I will not be adding this to any of my reports. Linda mentioned that a couple of nights before Nov. 8, her daughter woke up at 3 AM to a loud and very strange and unusual sound coming from the or- (Continued on Page 17) December 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Minnesota CE-1 sighting unexplained Type of Report: Close Encounter of the First kind-Nocturnal Lights at Close Range Investigator: Craig R. Lang, MS, CHt — MNMUFON Date/Time/Duration of Sighting: 11 Oct, 2001,8:45 PM CST for approximately 5 minutes. Place of Sighting: Lake Elmo, MM. Local Evaluation: Unexplained Witness Description: The witness is a 51-year-old female employed as a medi- cal technical worker. She holds a college degree and additional professional train- ing. She indicates that her vision is cor- rectable to 20/20 with glasses, which she was wearing at the time of the sighting. Her health and hearing are good. She has had no other major sightings or anomalous experiences. Her mother also had a sighting two days earlier, which we are investigating. Sighting Account: The witness was driving east on 10th street, which passes along the south boundary of Lake Elmo park reserve. While on 10th St., just after having turned onto it from Hwy 19, well prior to reaching the intersection with Lake Elmo Ave N., she noticed a bright light directly ahead in the distance (low in the eastern sky). She often sees aircraft in this direc- tion, and initially felt that the light might have been an approaching airplane. As she watched, she noted that the light was getting brighter, and at this point she felt that it no longer resembled an aircraft. At a point about halfway between Hwy 19 and Lake Elmo Ave N. she noted that the light was accompanied by a sec- ond light. She theorized that this might be a helicopter. She rolled down the driver's side window to listen for any sound, but did not hear anything unusual. She came to a stop at the stop sign at the intersection of 1 Oth St. and Lake Elmo Ave N. At this point, she noticed that the light had brightened still further, and now appeared to be more of a chevron shape. She felt that the object was consider- ably larger than an aircraft. She also noted that it appeared to be descending, and moving to the right. As she accelerated east from the stop sign at the intersec- tion with Lake Elmo Ave N., her view of the object was briefly obscured by some trees. A moment later, when she had moved past the trees, she observed a large chev- ron-shaped row of lights (see object de- scription, below) at the tree line, to the right of the road. The object appeared to be atop, or behind, the hill to the south of the road, and seemed to be hovering at treetop level. She slowed the car to a speed of less than 20 MPH (typical speeds on this stretch of road are about 60 MPH), and rolled down the right window. She ob- served that the object lit up the tree tops, and appeared to have a length of about \"six tree-widths.\" She describes feeling a sense that this was \"not normal,\" and seemed menacing. She arrived at the stop sign at the cor- ner of 10th St. and Manning Ave. and turned left onto Manning Ave. She ob- served in her rear view mirror that the trees were lit up, apparently from the ob- ject, but was unable to see the object at that point. She noted that there were several Mid- west (Telephone Company) workers at the intersection, apparently working on a tele- phone utility box at the corner. She ob- served that they did not seem to notice the nearby lights. Object Description: The drawing above is a witness sketch of the object as she observed it just over the tree line. Although a structure associated with the lights is suggested by the drawing, she indicates that she was not able to discern any platform or structure, and that the lights were as bright as those of an ath- letic field. The lights were white, and did not vary in position, form, or intensity. They appeared to be circular in shape, although the brightness made it di fficult to discern actual shape. Additional Witnesses: None are known. A check with nearby residents indicated that they had not seen anything unusual at the time of the sighting. Tele- phone company workers may have no- ticed the lights, although there was no indication of this. A check with the principal of the jun- ior high school indicated that no unusual activity had been reported there, and that no activities were underway that night, such as sports events, etc. A check with the sheriff's office and the Lake Elmo fire department indicated that there were no reports of unusual ac- tivity, and no emergency exercises. There were no events which would have em- ployed a large battery of lights. A check with the sheriff's department indicated no other police calls regarding UFO sightings Weather Conditions: The witness de- scribes the weather conditions as clear and calm. Weather conditions obtained from the Weather Underground website for the night of Oct. 11,2001 were as fol- lows: Few (if any) clouds at 6500 feet; Wind: calm; Temperature: 48 deg F.; Dew Pt: 40 deg F.; Humidity: 85%; Visibility: 10+ miles (unlimited). This agrees with the witness description. Explanations considered: aircraft land- ing lights, which appears to be unlikely, though not impossible (witness is famil- iar with aircraft landing at MSP airport), or sports or emergency lighting, which authorities have ruled out. The \"non-null\" hypothesis would be that the object was an anomalous craft, which had descended from the eastern sky, and had landed in the field behind the junior high school.

Hovering saucer in Florida PLANT CITY - The witness was on his way out to a shed when he saw a hovering saucer over an Oak tree. The trees are fully grown and stand maybe 50' high, and the saucer was hovering a few feet above them. The witness states, \"I only saw it be- cause of the moonlight. It had no lights. It was about 30 feet in diameter. It made no noise. I stared at it for a few moments trying to get a grip on the moment. I called my wife to hurry out- side and see this. She was in the kitchen by the back door and came out saying, 'What?' I pointed up and she looked up and said, 'Oh my God.' She stared at it with me. She said, 'Is that what I think it is?' I responded, 'Yes.' \"Then after a moment, it started to rise up, more like it was drifting up in the air like a balloon. Then it darted off at an incredible speed. Zero to hundreds of MPH in a second.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport, UFOcenter. Hovering object in Alabama CHEROKEE - Enroute from Sheffield to Cherokee, around sunset at about 7:15 PM, a couple saw something strange in the sky on Oct. 18,2003. They pulled off the highway and got out to watch it hov- ering about 500 feet away on the other side of the highway. The object had no lights, and made no sound, but it reflected the sunset with a pinkish color. They thought the object was metallic, and then it just vanished. It didn't fly away; it just disappeared. Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Silver disc in Kansas TOPEKA - The witness was driving north at 7 PM when he noticed a large military plane in the northern sky on Oct. 30, 2003, but higher up he saw a silver disc east of the plane. The military plane was moving away, but the silver disc was not moving. The witness said, \"I drove to a place where I could park my car and watch the disc. It started to move slowly to the west. I got back in the car and drove the four blocks to my house. When I got there, the disc was gone.\" Thanks to Pe- ter Davenport, UFOcenter.

Missouri flying triangle TROY - The observer on Oct. 30,2003, went outside at 10 PM to walk his dogs, and looked up to try to see the Aurora lights. There were no lights, but coming out of the NW was a strange looking tri- angular object. It was like an upside down kite in shape. There were four lights that were vis- ible, one in the front, one in the back, and one on each side. They were yellow lights that were not blinking as in most commer- cial aircraft. The witness says, \"It went over my home, and moved like it was gliding, but it was quick and was flying at 750 feet. If I held my fist up in the air, it appeared to cover it.\" There has been a series of sightings over West Central Missouri during the fall, with many reporting a strange row of bright lights hovering over fields, and fly- ing triangles. These sightings are not far from Whiteman Air Force Base, the home of the B-2 bomber.

The three lights blinked out at the same time, then a large ball of orange light ap- peared, and two lights broke off into a horizontal formation. They faded out again. \"This went on for almost an hour. Sometimes the ball would break off into a vertical formation, while at other times they flew in a horizontal or diagonal for- mation.

They broke off into a formation of four that were all perfectly spaced. \"Then when it reappeared it broke off into a formation of five lights, and finally into a vertical formation of six equally spaced lights. The main light never moved once it appeared. Once each ball of light went to its place in the formation, the formation stayed still for five seconds, and then would fade out all at the same time. \"My wife went next door to tell our neighbors.

Illinois lights in motion POPLAR GROVE - The witness was heading east on Route 173 on Sept. 30, 2003, when he reached Caledonia at 10:34 PM. He witnessed two craft that appeared to be planes with their landing lights on. The lights were not coming in his direc- tion, but when he reached Poplar Grove, he realized he was closing in on the craft, as they appeared larger and much brighter. Continuing east, the craft was fairly large and bright and appeared to be hov- ering. He reports, \"I shut the headlights off and got out and saw two planes fly- ing, but suddenly the two other hovering objects shot straight up in the sky, and within five seconds became distant stars themselves. They were very faint lights but visible. \"The distance traveled in that short time was incredible. It appeared that the craft flew 200-250 miles upward in a mat- ter of 5 seconds. These craft that I saw did not have blue or red lights, and did not appear to be planes at all. \"As I said, there were two other planes flying in the vicinity, which circled around and flew southwest toward Rockford Air- port direction.

The craft was lighted all along its length unlike an airplane, with some blue, red, and white lights flashing, within the overall white/blue light of the craft. \"I attempted to get to a better vantage point quickly, but had to proceed with caution, since the streets were filled with thousands. When I got there, the object was gone. Our airplanes do not have blue lights and our airplanes do not light up so you can see them at night. Only their navigation lights and headlamps are vis- ible.\" Canadian \"Lost in Space\" disc VANCOUVER - The observer reports seeing a disc that appeared like the origi- nal craft from \"Lost in Space\" at 3 PM on Oct. 31,2003. \"It had rotating multi-col- ored lights on the bottom and side of red, orange, green, blue, yellow, and white,\" the witness reports. \"It flew silent, low, and hovered. There were many more lights than any conven- tional airplane with rotating lights under and around the side. It didn't seem real, like Christmas tree lights rotating. It was eerily silent, and moved in more of a hover, with almost a slight wobble from too low a speed. It was enormous in size, and would have been visible to any- one who was outside at 3 AM, near En- glish Bay.\" UFOs reported in Venezuela CARACAS - Luminous UFOs were seen again last week near Cerro El Avila, a mountain on the capital's outskirts. On Oct. 21,2003, Sra. Ligia Peralta re- ported sighting of a strong luminous ob- ject of extremely large dimensions at 7:30 p.m. The object flew over the barrio Ola Juliano, and then darted away and disap- peared behind the peak of Cerro El Avila. At one point, the object descended to within eight meters (26 feet) of a house located on the hillside. She described the object as generating a very resplendent white light, which spread across the resi- dential zone for several minutes before the UFO retreated behind the mountain. On Saturday, Oct. 25, 2003, at 2 PM, five witnesses watched the aerial maneu- vers of a circular black object which moved dizzily over the highly-populated area at the foot of Cerro El Avila. The wit- nesses stated the object appeared repeat- edly and flew over the greater Caracas, before shooting off toward the horizon. Another witness, Srta. Raquel Rivero, spotted another UFO at 6 PM the same day over the Urbanizacion Mario Porezo. The young lady described an intense blu- ish-white light that was stationary for ten minutes, as its luminosity gradually di- minished.

UFOs in India MALSHEJ GHAT - The witness, who is 38 years old, took his family on a short holiday to a resort on Oct. 28, 2003. He reports, \"At about 4 AM, we were awak- ened because we had lost electricity and it was very hot inside the hotel room. We opened the balcony door and sat there a while. \"Soon my daughter noticed the valley was lit up by a pale white light. It was like a dull white fluorescent glow. Soon it faded out and we were confused. Then, we no- ticed that a 'star' was moving overhead. It was fast, but not as fast as a shooting star. Then we noticed another big star moving left to right slowly. \"Again, this was hard to believe, but then we noticed that as compared to other stars in that area this was the only one moving. Soon this bright star lost its light and faded away. After a lot of thought, I am convinced that this was a sighting of two UFOs.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Fast Missouri \"teardrop\" KANSAS CITY - The witness reports, \"I looked in the sky as I was driving down a semi-lit street at 10:53 PM on Oct. 6, 2003, and saw a bright light flash from one side of a flying object to the other. The light bent on the object as if it were curved or raindrop shape, and as if the object was spinning or turning. \"When the light got from one side to the other, the backside of the object was facing me and, as it did, the object dimmed and shot at least 20 miles across the sky and disappeared. It was a crystal clear night, so it didn't disappear into any clouds. \"I instantly called my house to tell my fiance what I saw, but as soon as I began to say hello, the weirdest noise shot through my cell; she told me she heard it on her phone too. I was only 1 mile from home. \"The noise sounded like radio fre- quency, but was only a second long. Conditions were clear, with no clouds.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Arizona saucer flashes gold KINGMAN - The witness was outside on Oct. 5,2003, about 9:14 PM, having a smoke and talking to his best friend when they saw a huge saucer floating over the neighbor's house. The witness states, \"I mean this thing was huge and had gold flashing lights, reminding me of gold and diamonds that were so bright and so glamorous. It was kind of rotating back and forth in small motions. I started to yell into the phone and told my friend to get her outside. \"I looked back up, just in time to see the saucer take off. I ran over to my Mom's house to tell her, and she said she was so jealous, because I always catch this kind of stuff. We all went outside, and about two minutes later about 40 planes filled the sky. They all met over the Cerbat Mountains and then separated. \"We have never seen more than five planes in the sky on any given night. After the planes left, a huge bolt of green light flew out of the sky and landed in the little mountains by my house. My Dad came running out, and the sky was filled with 40 planes again. \"Then another huge gold glowing light was hanging over by the Kingman Airport. We looked at it in the telescope, and it looked like two gold cat eyes. Then all these planes returned again, but within five minutes they were all gone. This was very real and very freaky! Thought I would share my experience! Thanks to Peter Davenport.

Make room Ricky Lake, because there's a new girl in town. Trade Austin-Peters is breathing new life into the talk-show forum with her local cable television show, Let's Talk...Paranormal. Despite the undeniable popularity of UFOs (next to sex, UFOs are the single most popular item on the world wide web), there are no nationally-distributed televi- sion talk shows featuring UFOs and the paranormal. Tracie is hoping to change all that and fill a niche in the glut of TV talk shows. Although her program is brand new, she is already garnering considerable ac- colades. She has attracted the attention of major UFO investigators like Nick Redfern, Barbara Lamb MFCC, Dr. Roger Leir, Jose Escamilla, and others. In its first season, the show earned a prestigious 24* annual \"Telly Award\" for outstanding cable show, beating out more than 14,000 applicants, most involving mainstream subjects. The staff behind the show is now pre- paring for the show to be nationally syn- dicated. Tracie's straight-forward, no- nonsense approach to the subject is a refreshing change from other shows which present an overly sensationalized UFO story and then bring out a parade of debunkers-all of which damages the cred- ibility of the subject. What makes Tracie's show especially different from all the other talk shows is that she has firsthand knowledge of her subject. You see Tracie is, herself, a UFO witness. In fact, her first UFO sighting was directly responsible for her becom- ing a television talk-show host. An interrupted journey In 1987, Tracie's life changed forever. She had trained since the age of eight for a promising career as a concert pianist. She had no opinions on the subject of UFOs, primarily because the idea had never really entered her consciousness. Then one afternoon, she was in her home outside of London, England, talk- ing with her best friend. Looking out the window, she got the shock of her life. A strange \"cone-shaped\" object hov- ered about a half-mile away, less than a thousand feet above the ground. Tracie Tracie Austin-Peters shouted out, \"What the hell is that?\" Her friend looked, and immediately ex- claimed, \"Oh, my God! It's a UFO!\" Tracie couldn't believe her eyes. \"What do you mean it's a UFO?\" At this point, the thought of extraterrestrials was the farthest thing from her mind. Her friend said, \"Well it stands for uni- dentified flying object,\" and he explained the most popular theories. Tracie looked at him in shock, \"Do you mean there are other beings piloting this thing? Aliens, if you will?\" He said, \"Yes, that's what it is.\" Tracie replied, \"Oh, my God!\" Tracie describes what she and her friend saw: \"We just stood and watched it'together. This thing was semi-trans- parent in color. You could almost see through it./..almost like a grayish color. It was pointed at the top of the cone, and the rounded bit at the bottom. And the whole thing was rotating across the sky. We just watched it rotate across the sky. It was absolutely silent, no noise, no lights on this thing.\" They watched the strange object move away and disappear off the horizon. Both were totally convinced that they had seen something very unusual. Further confirmation came the next day when a London newspaper. The Evening Standard, published a front-page article detailing the sighting. Apparently there had been a large number of witnesses, all of whom described the same object. This incident effectively ended About the author Preston Dennett, a MUFON field in- vestigator, has written numerous articles for the Journal. His books include UFOs Over Topanga Canyon, UFO Healings, and One in Forty: The UFO Epidemic. His latest book is Visitations: True Ac- counts of Alien Contact. Tracie's career as a concert pianist. All her lifelong plans went straight out the window. Instead, the sighting became the inspiration for a whole new direction in her life. Like many UFO witnesses, she found herself radically transformed by the experience. Life would never be the same. Says Tracie, \"It made me question who I was and what I was trying to do with my life. It really opened up a bigger picture of life for me. It just totally opened ev- erything up, questioned everything there was to question. There was a grand scale to all this.\" A guided mission Following a sighting, many UFO wit- nesses feel compelled to learn more about UFOs and spread the word about their experience. They may also feel some- how guided in their efforts to publicize the phenomenon. For Tracie, this after- effect was very strong. She first began to read books on the subject. To her shock, she discovered what most skeptics never realize: that there is a huge amount of information on UFOs. Surprised by the vast amount of evi- dence, Tracie bought more books, maga- zines, and videos. She then attended the conferences and lectures she could find. Tracie now felt the need to inform oth- ers about the UFO phenomenon. All thoughts of becoming a concert pianist were put on the back burner as she made plans to educate the public. Disappointed that there weren't more conferences, she helped to set up her own UFO conference. Despite doing almost no advertising, the impromptu conference was enormously popular, leaving stand- ing room only. Nearly two hundred people had to be turned away. Tracie then realized that people were desperate for valid information on this most baffling enigma. Then came another surprise: the UFO Page 14 MUFON UFO Journal December 2003"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"sightings continued. Tracie found her- self a victim of what investigator's call the repeater problem. Once you see a UFO, the chances are much more likely that you will have another sighting. This turned out to be true for Tracie. She had a series of sightings of unusual lights and objects in the sky. This inspired her to continue her investigations and publicizing efforts, and to her amazement things began to fall almost magically into place. She soon hosted several other con- ferences and was also the host for England's UFO Network News. Around this time, Tracie began to think that she had to do her own show. In 1999, at a conference in England, she met Jim Peters, former MUFON Colo- rado assistant state director. They were married two years later. Tracie moved to the United States and eventually settled in Santa Clarita, CA. It was there that she had the single most amazing UFO sight- ing of her entire life. It was 6:45 in the evening on Nov. 13, 2001. The sky was just turning dark. Jim and Tracie were driving on a street in Stu- dio City, CA, when Jim noticed something unusual low in the sky, just a short dis- tance ahead of them. He turned to Tracie and said, \"Look at that plane; it looks like it should be fall- ing from the sky.\" \"Oh, my God, you're right. It should be falling from the sky. What is that thing?\" Tracie describes the object: \"It was traveling too slow and was at an ex- tremely low altitude. We didn't actually see a plane as such. It was just two white lights, side by side. Well, then the two lights changed into three, and the middle light came on. \"So we rolled the windows down on the car, and lo and behold, totally silent was a black triangular craft that came over the car less than two hundred feet. At this point, we have our hands on the door handles ready to get out of the car and do our Scully and Mulder bit if you will. We are right underneath this thing, just looking up. What is it?\" Tracie admits that at this point, a few expletives escaped her mouth. She real- ized she was seeing an apparent ET craft close-up. Says Tracie, \"I'm looking up and I shout out, 'My God, it's a UFO!' And it stopped and hovered over the car. As soon as I said it, the whole thing stopped and hovered. It had white lights running underneath it, cold white lights. And there was an outer framework of this craft. \"It was black...it was there for about six seconds, I would say. And then it did this amazing, amazing turn that even Steven Spielberg in all honesty would have difficulty trying to recreate. And it just turned and it did this amazing glide, and it went off.\" Tracie then shouted out to her hus- band, \"Let's follow it!\" They chased the object down the street, but they caught several red lights and the object disap- peared out of view. Jim said they spotted a low-flying Cessna later and noticed that the airplane was easily seen because it was illuminated from below by the city's light pollution, in addition to producing noticeable en- gine noise. The flying triangle, on the other hand, was completely silent and reflected no light even though it was at a lower altitude. Both Tracie and Jim were, of course, deeply impressed by the sighting. They separately drew what they had seen, and reported their sightings to Peter Daven- port at the UFO hotline. Tracie now reveals an even deeper aspect to the sighting. As she says, \"The part that I didn't mention, as soon as it was over the car hovering, I had a tele- pathic connection or communication from this. And one of the beings on board was telling me that there were three be- ings on board the craft, and they were from the Pleiades star system.\" Again, Tracie had the strange feeling that the sighting was meant for them. As she says, \"I was just wondering if that sighting was for Jim and me. I don't know. Because since I had my sighting in Lon- don in 1987,1 just feel like I have been guided in this subject to follow it through, to investigate, to research.. .kind of like a mission. \"I have felt it since the day I had the sighting. It feels like I've had guidance to bring this to the forefront and to do something with it, because it's needed. It's needed to open it up.\" Let's talk paranormal What made the Peters' sighting so meaningful was that Tracie had just launched her own public access televi- sion show, \"Let's Talk... Paranormal.\" It was as if the UFO was again guiding and acknowledging. At first the program was distributed only locally through Santa Clarita. Soon, however, things just fell into place again, and the show was networked in Arizona, and from there onto the worldwide web. The show immediately received an in- credible response. Viewer emails arrived from as far as Canada, Australia, and En- gland. Although they are staffed only by volunteers and have only a shoe- string budget, the husband and wife team has put together a very professional pro- gram, as evidenced by their winning a coveted finalist 24* Annual Telly award. The show is now becoming increas- ingly popular. While most talk shows fumble around the subject, Tracie's back- ground gives her the compassion and insight that are so valuable in the investi- gation of UFOs. Says Tracie, \"Let s Talk...Paranormal discusses topics from A-Z of the strange, but true! That's exactly what this unique talk show is all about. Conversation and exploration of other realities that reside on and off the planet. Weekly voyages of the strange, but true, week after week, presenting mind-stretching information and truly unforgettable guests. \"My show aims to bring forth a pro- lific array of topics which are compelling and possibly life-changing, and leave the viewer questioning the world in which we live. This is a talk show with a differ- ence.\" \"Let's Talk...Paranormal\" presents the subject of UFOs with objectivity and knowledge and compassion. Those who want further information are encouraged to visit the program's website at www.letstalkparanormal.com. The site contains a list of former and future guests as well as biographies, clips from the show, and all kinds of links to other pages.

December 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"By Jenny Randies Jennv Randies Island of dreams Last year I wrote a column about the magical Isle of Man, situated in the midst of the Irish Sea equidistant between all kingdoms of the British Isles. I told of how its creation legends, its living folklore about themselves (as they call the fairy folk), and many other things make this a sort of supernatu- ral isle of the blessed. Indeed its links with the mythical land \"Tir na nog\" do exist. My book about this fascinating place (Supernatural Isle of Man) has just been published in the UK (the only place it is ever likely to be published, of course, even though the Isle of Man is a crown dependency and not a part of either the UK or the European Union!) This gave me the opportunity to revisit the island-something I never need much of an excuse for-to carry out a pro- motional tour. I thought I would take the chance to update you on some of the things that I discovered whilst over there. The island is about much more than just UFOs-being the origin of the crop circle mystery, for example, with legends of the fallen fairy—the fenoderee-creat- ing mowing patterns that predate any other known detailed accounts by sev- eral centuries. But for the purposes of this column I will focus on its UFO heritage. UFO zone There seems to be a window area that settles on the north of the island, between Onchan and the flat plains around Andreas, where history and culture mix in a splendidly anachronistic fashion. Two of the kingdom of Mann's most important influence-Celtic founders and Viking settlers-merge here (the Vikings created the world's oldest continuous parliamentary democracy on the island more than 1000 years ago). As a result you can see Celtic stone crosses dating back to those days in which sagas about the Norse gods are deftly incorporated. In and around Andreas (where, by the way, both mod- ern day crop circles and the legendary actions of the mowing fairy were also concentrated) there are hundreds of years of tales of what we would easily under- stand today to be alien abductions. Except when, in one case, a little boy was \"taken\" from his home to a strange land where humanoid beings the size of small children resided, and where time flowed at a.different rate from the world outside-then we would today sub- stitute the words \"extraterrestrial\" and \"UFO\" for what the Manx thought of as \"fairies\" and \"fairyland.\" In addition, most of the modern UFO activity is concentrated on this part of the island. There is a wonderful place called \"Sky Hill,\" believed to be an an- cient fairy city, where you can see right across the sea to the Dumfries and Gallo-' way district of southern Scotland, only 30 miles away. Interestingly, this perfect skywatch location has generated many reports of strange lights in the sky, and has what may be the longest \"repeater\" sighting of aliens-interpreted in at least three dif- ferent ways (as a goblin, ghost, and alien) across the various sightings that date back at least 200 years. Equally interestingly, the Dumfries and Galloway region of Scotland has long been recognized as being a modern hot- bed of UFO activity, and has produced some fascinating cases. In one of these, two glowing discs left the Scottish coast and headed towards the northern tip of Mann. A farmer tend- ing his cattle in the middle of the night saw the herd panic as these things shot over and, indeed, the cows stopped pro- ducing milk for days afterwards. He also discovered the next morning that his hair had turned white, virtually overnight, as a consequence of his close encounter. Moreover, in an independent but pos- sibly related story, a large group of racing pigeons released the night before from this part of southern Scotland were heading for Preston in Lancashire. Their journey would take them across the Irish Sea close to the north of the Isle of Man, but they never arrived. What happened to them remains un- known, but it was speculated that some- how the magnetic guidance system in their heads used to navigate through the earth's geomagnetic field somehow got disrupted-which is why homing pigeons sometimes fail to \"home.\" Possibly an energy field left by the UFOs could have done that, just as it may have affected the chemicals in the farmer's hair and upset the milking pat- terns of the cows. This case occurred in 1978, but I found eerily similar tales from the same part of the Isle of Man centuries earlier in which the failure of cows to give milk after the appearance of strange lights was assumed to be a \"curse\" placed on them by the fairies who were, of course, the believed culprits in the days when nobody had dreamt about aliens and spaceships. Energy Energy does indeed seem to be the key to many of the cases on the Isle of Man. An intriguing incident from 1957 on this part of the island tells of glowing lights that passed over a fishing vessel, and how the crew swears that its paint separated during close proximity. What they meant was that the overcoat vanished, leaving just the bare undercoat on the ship's railings-and yet, next day the paint was back to nor- mal. Although nobody at the time under- stood the meaning of these odd events, what struck me was the link with a num- ber of local cases regarding fairy abductions in which the people who were rescued (or, indeed, in some cases the tes- timony of the rescuers) reported that there had been an attractive power in- side \"fairyland\" that variously pulled and then repelled them. We might recognize this today as some sort of magnetic force, but in those days such things were regarded as just being magical. I could not help but wonder if this is the same power that affected the racing pigeons, and whether it was able to magnetize the ship's railings and temporarily \"separate\" the particles of metallic paint, just as a magnet pushes Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal December 2003"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"iron filings aside. Once the region has its magnetic charge disipated, presumably such a repulsion effect would vanish. Could this explain the otherwise baffling events on board the fishing vessel? The UFO crash In January, 2001, another remarkable case happened in this part of the island when multiple witnesses observed a UFO seemingly crash into the top of the island's highest peak, known as Snaefell (an ancient Viking word for \"snow mountain\"). Accompanying this was a major loss of transmission power, which caused massive telecommunications disruption that day. Another energy signature left by a Manx UFO. Investigations into this case have re- vealed suspicions that the powers that be knew what was going on-or at least knew more about it than they have ever let on. Connections with secret flying craft on test from remote Scottish islands have been mooted by some UFOlogists, but I was able to talk to one of the men on the island who has spent some time digging into this story. He achieved local fame by getting the rock group \"The Bee Gees\" to record the Manx national anthem (two of the Gibb brothers were born on the island). He was fascinated by this UFO case. He thinks that there is a big story behind this 2001 incident, and that the pressure put to bear on the local authorities, such as the police-in some cases possibly or- chestrated by the defense authorities—is rather disturbing. He hopes to produce a book of his own telling the story of his association with this case, and I get the impression that we have not heard the last about this \"Manx Roswell,\" which, certainly on the mainland, is usually thought to have been \"explained\" as an accident involv- ing what police were led to believe was a \"model aircraft\"—one that was never found. It had to have been quite a model, given that witnesses clearly saw it from several miles away! There is an intriguing link between this case and one that happened on the Isle of Lewis five years earlier when a \"coincidental\" Royal Navy exercise en- tered the area of ocean where a UFO had been seen to crash, and was reported to have \"retrieved\" something-possibly another \"model aircraft.\" There was some interest in this case shown by American covert defense au- thorities, although this was later said to have been limited to the possibility that this was a space debris burn-up or mete- orite fall-which most investigators in the UK eventually came to accept. Given the comparison with these events in January, 2001, on the Isle of Man and the obvious interest in both by the defense authorities (who usually prefer a lower profile where UFO cases are concerned), I think there is reason to suppose that there is more going on here than meets the eye-although not, of course, necessarily unconnected with covert terrestrial activities. Inks conducts session on forms, radiation Gaylord Louis Inks, the Chief Investi- gator for Oklahoma MUFON, held a five- hour training session on Oct. 11, in Gran- ite, OK, to instruct the proper procedure for filling out MUFON report forms and also to demonstrate the use of air radia- tion equipment, ground radiation equip- ment, and Geiger counters. Each training session attendee received a folder with all MUFON report forms and hands-on training with the radiation equip- ment. Louis purchased all of the radiation equipment with his own money with the expressed purpose of using it for MUFON investigations. Canadian update...

She couldn't even give me an example of what the noise sounded like, as it was so strange. The very next night after the daugh- ter heard this crazy noise, Linda said she was awakened at 4:05 AM to the same sound, or at least something she could not make any sense of. She said the dogs were going crazy, and the cows in the area were acting up, so she got out of bed and moved onto the balcony and looked to- ward the orchard. It was dark, and she could see noth- ing, but could still hear the sound. She told me she started clapping her hands, making noises herself, and the strange sound eventually stopped, although the dogs still were acting up. Since the sound had stopped, Linda decided to go back to bed. However, no sooner did she get back under the covers than the noise returned. She rolled over and tried to block out the sound until she ended up going to sleep. X3, Healing, Entities, and Aliens by Adrian Dvir, 5x8 softcover, 422 pages (plus CD), $19.95. Available from the author at 47 Herzl St., Richon Lezion, Israel 75290. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly The thesis of this book, based on the claimed personal expe- riences of the Israeli author, is that the aliens are here to help. Dvir, who holds an MS degree in com- puter engineering, is involved with military computer systems at a major Israeli communi- cations company. The author's strange experiences reportedly began while composing graphics software. \"I suddenly felt as though I'd tuned in to someone else's feelings....At the same time a face began to take shape in my mind....Judging from the lines and wrinkles, it seemed to be the face of an elderly woman, and someone I had never seen before.\" Following a brief question and answer session, Dvir became frightened and cut off the contact. He says he was later able to also contact his deceased father. Unable to talk about his experiences with co-workers, he sought out a medium. His first brush with the medical aspect of his experiences came as a result of an apparent contact with a famous deceased surgeon. \"As I soon discovered, one of the more practical and fascinating aspects of contact with this hidden universe is the whole concept and practice of heal- ing.\" Eventually, contacts with non-humans were made through a medium-healer named Chaya. The author was grossly overweight, and the aliens discovered that this had resulted from problems in a previous life. They eliminated this prob- lem, and the author lost 67 pounds. The aliens also discovered a genetic defect in the author which had kept him from writ- ing manually, and cured it. From being the patient, the author be- came the \"healer,\" after the aliens were assured that he had a positive personal- ity and wanted to help people. Besides personally healing individu- als, he assisted in setting up \"alien hos- pitals\" as a more effective alternative to traditional medicine. Reportedly, there are more than 50 such clinics in Israel. December 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PERCEPTIONS By Stanton T. Friedman Listening Tor those who are here One of my earliest papers at a MUFON Symposium was presented in Kansas City, MO, June 16, 1973. The title was \"UFOLOGY and the Search for ET Intelli- gent Life.\" 1 contrasted the silly approaches of the radio astronomers, science fiction writers and exobiology's, with their very active theories and their total unwilling- ness to look at the UFO data, or at the technological and security aspects of the UFO problem, or the work of Marjorie Fish on the Zeta Reticuli star map, and that Stanton Friedman of other serious ufologists. It is distressing that so little has changed in the 30 years. Now it is ETI Cultists making loads of pseudoscientific pronouncements. I challenged SETI Spe- cialists at my web site (www.v-j- enterprises.com/sfpage.html) in a paper entitled \"UFOs: Challenge to SETI Spe- cialists.\" Nobody has taken me up on the challenge. The latest bit of foolishness is an internet piece, Oct. 23,2003, by Dr. Seth Shostak, Public Program Scientists of the SETI Institute in Mountainview, CA, en- titled \"Can Aliens Find Us?\" (http:// www. space, com/search forlife/ seti_Shostak_aliens_031023). Dr. Shostak is the author of many pa- pers and some books, and a new one, Cosmic Company: The Search for Life in the Universe, with Alexandra Bamett. I haven't obtained it yet. Over a year ago 1 tried on the Art Bell radio show, on which Shostak has ap- peared, to challenge him to a debate. He refused the challenge. Why let the facts get in the way of the silly theories of the SETI Specialists? Dr. Shostak makes a reasonable case that civilizations not too many light years away could, presuming our level of de- velopment, detect planets around the Sun, and not too long after the detection could determine that there was some sort of bio- logical activity here on Earth based on the composition of the atmosphere. Page 18 This was, of course, pointed out years ago by Carl Sagan in an article in Scien- tific American. As a matter of fact, any- body checking Earth out over the last two billion years would know that. Shostak also points out that anybody else in the solar system could certainly determine that there was intelligence here because they could observe various structures. He wrongly claims that one couldn't see the great wall of China from orbit around earth, even though astronauts early on claimed to see things having a smaller width than the theorists claimed could be resolved from space. Early in the space program the \"ex- perts\" thought that space travel must be distressing to the minds of the astro- nauts- how else to explain their impos- sible visual claims? As it happens a series of experiments were conducted that showed that one could see much finer detail from orbit than had been anticipated. The theorists were wrong. He also notes some schemes that have been proposed to make sure Martians could tell there was intelligent life here, such as digging huge trenches in the Sa- hara and having oil burning in them. Shostak's claim is that the only way a civilization from outside of our solar sys- tem, but within a few hundred light years, could tell we were here would be as the result of receiving FM radio, television, or radar signals. Early AM radio wouldn't do, since the signals remained within the atmosphere. But higher frequency signals pen- etrate the atmosphere, and, as time goes by, more and more civilizations will pick up our TV programs as the signals move out. He wrongly claims there are 5000 stars within 50 light years. The correct number is about 1000. Nowhere does he even hint at the possibility that aliens might be checking us out in \"person\" or know a lot about past civilizations on this planet that might have generated primitive radio signals millions of years ago. Or that the galactic Federation would maintain a listening device near any place where civilization is in the process of de- veloping. Libraries in the local neigh- borhood may keep a record of where civi- lizations are-since a billion years ago. He doesn't mention that the hundreds MUFON UFO Journal of above ground nuclear explosions also provide a signal far more powerful than any of our TV or radar stations. Did Columbus wait until he received smoke signals from Indians in the Ameri- cas before he headed west? Explorers have long had the habit of venturing forth to see what and who was out there. I guess astronomers prefer to sit at home and theorize. Not only does Shostak not even hint at the possibility of interstellar travel (something about which most astrono- mers are completely ignorant), but, of course, he totally ignores the huge amount of evidence indicating that aliens are already visiting here. Now. Presumably they started the visits a long time ago, since accounts go back to at least biblical times. He makes no mention of the fact that while the Sun is out in the boondocks-at least 4+ light years from the next star over-that just down the street, 39 light years away, there are two Sun-like stars (Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli) only an eighth of a light year apart (30 times closer to each other than we are to the next star over), and about a billion years older than the Sun. It may be hard for local astronomers to realize that there are astronomers in other solar systems that almost certainly know far more about the universe in which we live than do Earthling astronomers. Some may well be making excursions to our local neighborhood... even if they haven't made any luncheon appoint- ments with SETI Specialists. It seems to me very reasonable to sug- gest that in such a situation, with nearby neighboring planets just down the street, interstellar travel would be a much higher priority than it would be here in our solar system out in the boondocks. After all, from a planet around one of the stars, the other star would be pretty much visible all day long; planets around the other star would be directly observ- able. No guessing would be required. On whichever planet interstellar travel technology developed first, it would be natural for a union or a confederation to be set up. Once that was established, it would be natural to move out to other locations in the neighborhood for colo- nization, migration, imprisonment, use of resources, vacationing, etc. Considering that technological December 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"progress almost invariably is the result of doing things differently in an unpre- dictable way, and the long time available for them to have developed incredible- to-us technology while we were playing at being cave men, their technology would certainly seem to be like magic to our com- paratively primitive society. It is easy to take current technology for granted as though it has always been available. The Wright Brothers' first flight was in December, 1903, only a century ago. I was rather shocked, when in a.col- lege classroom in Florida in October, I mentioned that when I started work in industry in 1956 I was still using a slide rule. I suddenly realized that the students didn't know what I was talking about. I asked, and only the instructors had ever seen one. In short, it is very reasonable to ex- pect that anybody even a little more ad- vanced than we are knows a great deal more than we do. Astronomers, of all people, should be very aware of how many false proclama- tions they have made over the past two centuries, such as how young and small the universe is, how Venus is a tropical paradise, there can't be any water on Mars, Mercury keeps the same face to the Sun, space travel is utter bilge, there is only one galaxy (ours of course), and that trips to the moon are impossible, as well as the establishing of satellites in orbit. Shostak actually makes the claim that it is very unlikely that there is any civili- zation within 50 light years. Ones further out couldn't have received our powerful electromagnetic waves, so they would not know we were here. Of course, no data is provided to substantiate this totally un- supportable proclamation. Ours may be the only solar system in the local neighborhood that does not have the capability of interstellar travel or interstellar communication using newer techniques about which we know noth- ing. Of course, even if somebody 50 light years away has heard our signals it would be another 50 years before we could pick up their responses. This would indeed provide job security for radio astronomers. Meanwhile, aliens are coming and go- ing, abducting Earthlings, checking us out, being seen in large numbers, being observed on radar, and producing physi- cal traces in more than 65 countries. But since they can't possibly be here, there is no reason to look at the evidence. This is pseudoscientific thinking, not sci- ence. Stan Friedman fsphys@rogers.com December 2003 Mystery \"aeroplanes\" seen near Lake Superior in 1916 By T. Peter Park S uperior, WI, and Duluth, MM, sister cities on opposite sides of the St. Louis River at Lake Superior's western tip, were gripped by a now almost forgotten UFO wave in Feb- ruary, 1916. Duluth and Superior citizens reported mysterious lights and \"aeroplanes\" in the sky, on one occasion seeing three \"men\" aboard a machine. It was in the middle of World War I, and while the United States was still neutral, the mysterious \"aeroplanes\" inspired fears of bombing. Workers in a local munitions plant even stayed home out of fear of their fac- tory being bombed. Back in 1916, very few people thought about extraterrestrial visitors, so strange aerial lights and con- traptions were ascribed to secretive in- ventors or to foreign spies, saboteurs, or bombers. Finally, in a curious anticipation of the Air Force's response to Roswell some 31 years later, the mystery was \"solved\" when a couple of Duluth watchmen found the remnants of a crashed home-made toy balloon, \"proving\" the lights and \"aeroplanes\" to have been a practical joke by pranksters perpetrating a hoax. Jerome Clark's Spring 2000 Anomalist article, \"From Mermaids to Little Gray Men: The Prehistory of the UFO Abduc- tion Movement\" (No. 8, Spring 2000, p. 19) very briefly mentioned the \"first cred- ible-sounding CE3 from an American newspaper,\" published \"in a Superior, Wisconsin, paper on February 29, 1916, during a local UFO wave.\" According to Clark's summary of the case, dock workers on Lake Superior around 4:30 AM that morning observed the passage of a large flying craft in which three \"men\" were clearly visible. As far as Clark knew, this was \"the only report of UFO occupants to be published in the American press between 1897 and 1947, when the UFO age began.\" The 1916 Superior sightings have not so far been mentioned in any UFO or Fortean book or website. A quite thor- ough search of the UFO literature and databases by Thomas M. Olsen, presi- dent of the UFO Information Retrieval Center in Phoenix, AZ, indicated no ref- erences to the case. However, I have now found some original newspaper reports of the 1916 MUFON UFO Journal Lake Superior UFO wave after some in- quiries to Duluth and Superior newspa- pers and libraries. Julie Levang of the Duluth Public Library has sent me photo- stats of \"aeroplane\" stories from the Su- perior Telegram, Feb. 29,1916, and from the Duluth News Tribune, March 1 and March 2,1916. The Feb. 29 Superior Telegram story, \"Mysterious Aeroplane Continues Noc- turnal Trips Over Superior,\" is of course the article cited by Jerome Clark. The Duluth News Tribune stories, \"Sky Rover Is Captured at Ore Dock\" (March 1) and \"Air Mystery Fully Solved\" (March 2) are devoted to the Roswell-style \"solution\" of the mystery as a crashed home-made toy hot-air bal- loon found by two Duluth watchmen, but mention a whole wave of sightings of mysterious aerial lights and contraptions by Duluth and Superior residents during the previous week. The Feb. 29 Superior Telegram piece began by describing that morning's Su- perior waterfront sightings of a huge \"aeroplane\" with three \"men\" aboard. It continued with brief summaries of aerial light and machine sightings over Duluth and Superior the previous several nights, mentioning the wartime bombing fears inspired by the mysterious overflights. The Telegram makes it quite clear that the early morning dockside sighting later mentioned by Jerome Clark was not an isolated incident, but rather the most spectacular incident in a whole wave of puzzling sightings. Five watchmen at the Globe Elevators, the Great Northern Elevator, and the Carnegie Coal Dock on Superior's St. Louis River waterfront saw and heard an \"aeroplane\" with three lights carrying three passengers fly from east to west over the docks and elevators between 4:30 and 4:45 AM on the morning of Tues- day, Feb. 29,1916. The witnesses heard \"roaring\" or \"purring\" engine noises coming from the sky, and saw a big \"aeroplane\" with three lights and three \"men\" aboard, at a height of 600 to 1,000 feet, trailing a long rope or cable with a large block or object at the end, heading up the St. Louis River and vanishing to the west. John Gustavson, watchman at the Carnegie Coal Dock, estimated its altitude (Continued on following page) Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"January Bright Planets (Evening Sky): The Stars: Venus (magnitude -4.0) is low in the SW during twilight and sets in the WSW about 7 PM on Jan. 1 and after 8 PM at month's end.

John Tullyson, head watch- man at Globe Elevators, described the \"aeroplane\" as \"flying along very fast\" with a \"roaring noise\" about 4:30, and estimated its altitude at about 600 feet. He described it as 50 feet wide and 100 feet long, with three lights, one at each end and one in the middle. He saw one of the three \"men\" sitting near the front of the machine, \"probably running it\"; the other two a little behind him and seem- ingly \"looking around.\" Two other Globe Elevator night watch- men, Carl Hanson and Frank Poto, did not see the machine, which had disappeared behind an elevator, but heard its engine noise. A night watchman at the Great Northern Elevator who wished to remain anonymous heard a \"purring noise in the sky\" about 4:30 or 4:45 and saw an \"aeroplane\" passing over to the west, with three lights \"of a sort of reddish color.\" Several people in Superior and Duluth had seen \"aeroplanes\" or moving lights in the sky the previous evening and night, Feb. 28, according to the Telegram. Ar least three other Duluth residents telephoned the police that night to report seeing the machine, \"each demanding that the flights be stopped, and each express- ing fear of bombs.\" The whole epidemic of mysterious lights and aircraft sightings had been mass hysteria set off by a few pranks, the Duluth News Tribune crowed on March 1 and again on March 2 after Duluth ore dock watchmen John Dormedy and Albert Dalduc found fragments of a crashed home-made hot air balloon. Dormedy and Dalduc had been watch- ing the mysterious yellow lights leaving the earth somewhere on the Wisconsin shore every night, rising gradually, and .disappearing in one direction or another. Around 10:30 on the night of Feb. 29, they closely watched one of the \"celestial wan- derers\" start on its \"celestial cruise\" and disappear toward the west. Soon they saw a second light leave the ground at the same point where they had seen the first one. However, instead of bearing west- ward, it came straight across the bay to- ward Dormedy and Balduc. They could hear the roar of the engine exhausts and the excited shouts of the passengers. \"Something was going wrong,\" Dormedy told the News Tribune.

The study is being supported by the Bial Foundation of Portugal, which has provided a 36,000 Euro grant. The project team includes Chris French, Rachel Fox, Krissy Wilson and Julia Santomauro (APRU members) and Dr Michael Thalbourne (parapsycholegist, APRU, University of Adelaide),\" with James Basil and Mark Gibbons (Foundation for the Research of Extraordinary Trauma & Support for Abductees) acting as con- sultants.

It was flying a little lower than 1,000 feet, \"so low I thought it was illegal.\" Then, as he tried unsuccessfully to view the object through his binoculars, he watched it bank west behind Paradise Ridge and disappear The sighting had lasted two or three minutes. A friend also observed the object with Butler, but declined to be interviewed, cit- ing fears that he may \"end up on some future Men in Black list.\" The Durango-La Plata County Airport reported no unusual activity on at the time of the sighting, except that an American West Express plane had departed about that time. If it had gone north, it might have flown along the path that Butler described. The National Weather Service at Grand Junction reported no record of any sight- ing on that date. The Department of Defense Strategic Command in Nebraska, which tracks space debris, did not track any object predicted for entry at that time and location,a spokesman said. December 2003 Butler explained, \"I'm a scientist at heart, so I'm a pretty skeptical person. I've been going to air shows in Oshkosh (Wisconsin) since I was a kid. It wasn't like any military technology I've seen.\" He noted, howver, that the object could be some sort of advanced military technology. He adds that the object did not make a sound, \"and was notable for what it didn't have\": no markings, no cockpit, no port- holes, no tail or dorsal fins, no stabilizing equipment, no propellers, no visible en- gines, and no visible rivets. \"It wasn't thermalling,\" he observed, \"and there was no heat distortion behind the (back) end. I thought it had to be a military drone at one point, because there was no control, no propulsion. \"It was a clear, beautiful afternoon. My friend thought he saw a bird.

Schuessler MUFON International Director M any agree that high strange- ness UFO cases offer the best opportunity to learn something new, and perhaps find a solu- tion to the UFO mystery. However, few people are willing to risk speculating on the mecha- nism behind that strange- ness factor. In- stead they continue to in- vestigate UFOs in the same old way,. basing their findings on the accepted norm of the day. Therefore, many very interesting UFO incidents have been written off as mis- takes or impossibilities because they do not fit the prescribed mold of what a UFO must do or not do to be accepted as real by today's standards. UFO reports by highly credible wit- nesses contain descriptions of seemingly impossible operating characteristics. Some are said to be huge, but able to soundlessly hover in mid-air and then shoot away at extreme speeds. For years they have been clocked fly- ing faster than the speed of sound while in the atmosphere, but without creating the expected sonic boom. Some may ap- pear as a disc or sphere and then sud- denly become a point of light and then blink out. Others seem to change shape as they perform certain maneuvers. Some seem to have stealth capabilities and shield themselves from radar. There have been reports of objects becoming visible in the air as if they came through some sort of portal. Abductees tell how their captors come into their room and take them out through the wall. Perhaps if we looked at these characteristics from a futurist perspective, they may not be as impossible as they now seem. In 1966, Dr. J. Allen Hynek said, \"I have begun to feel that there is a tendency in the 20 th Century science to forget that there will be a 21 st Century science, and indeed a 30 th Century science, from which vantage points our knowledge of the uni- verse may appear quite different than it does today.\" What if there are other civilizations that are hundreds or even thousands of years ahead of us in their development? Isn't it possible that their technology would be so far ahead of ours that it would seem to us to be impossible? Arthur C. Clarke has observed that \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" Perhaps we'Should start trying to think about these things with an eye to the future, rather than to the past. In its simplest form, programmable matter exists today. For example, an LCD screen's optical properties can be dra- matically altered by the application of elec- trical signals. Other examples are photodarkening or photochromic materi- als found in light sensitive sunglasses. In the book Hacking Matter: Levitat- ing Chairs, Quantum Mirages, and the Infinite Weirdness of Programmable At- oms, by rocket scientist Wil McCarthy (Basic Books, March 2003, ISBN 0-465- 04428-X, $26.00), programmable matter is treated as the wave of the future. The IEEE Spectrum magazine points out that \"the promise of programmable matter could make the technology revo- lution wrought by semiconductors to date look like a warm-up for the main act.\" McCarthy's book description argues that \"programmable matter is probably not the next technological revolution, nor even perhaps the one after that. But it's coming, and when it does it will change our lives as much as any invention ever has. \"Imagine being able to program mat- ter itself—to change it, with the click of a cursor, from hard to soft, from paper to stone, from fluorescent to super-reflec- tive to invisible. \"Supported by companies ranging from Levi Strauss to IBM and the Defense Department, solid-state physicists in labo- ratories at MIT, Harvard, Sun Microsystems, and elsewhere are cur- rently creating arrays of microscopic de- vices called \"quantum dots\" that are ca- pable of acting like programmable atoms. \"They can be configured electroni- cally to replicate the properties of any known atom and then can be changed, as fast as an electrical signal can travel, to have the properties of a different atom. Soon it will be possible not only to engi- neer into solid matter such unnatural prop- erties as variable magnetism, program- mable flavors, or exotic chemical bonds, but also to change these properties at will.\" Before we discard the high strange- ness UFO cases as impossible, perhaps we would be better off figuring out the mechanism behind the strangeness char- acteristics indicated in those cases. Maybe someone else has already done this and we have had a glimpse of the future. Mystery \"aeroplanes\"...

However, \"there was nothing but the machine left.\" The \"aviators\" were \"gone completely.\" Dormedy and Dalduc found only \"a cute little wire frame, a few frag- ments of tissue paper, and some charred excelsior,\" the remnants of \"a toy bal- loon, a big one...but a tissue paper one just the same.\" Late on the afternoon of March 1, they ventured out on the ice of the channel opposite end of the dock and brought in the main framework of the balloon, frag- ments of which had landed on their dock on Tuesday night, Feb. 29. \"The red and green lights are ex- plained,\" the article remarked. The frame- work of the balloon was about 5 feet high, 3 feet wide at the top, and constructed of heavy wire. The paper that had evidently covered the balloon was completely burned off. A small red lantern was suspended by a thin wire 8 feet from the bottom of the framework. The glass globe was not even broken by the fall, though the framework was slightly bent.

One of the initiatives most desired by our members was to find a way to take the information in the MUFON archives and make it available for researchers to use. Thanks to a number of dedicated people we began the process of convert- ing these paper files into searchable elec- tronic files. Ultimately, we will be able to provide customized electronic reports on about any facet of the information contained in the archives. We call this the MUFON Pandora Project. It will be a long and dif- ficult task, but the good news is that it is underway. The 2003 MUFON International UFO Symposium, held in Dearborn, MI, in July, was very successful. It was a positive and enjoyable event. We are already plan- ning for the 2004 symposium to be held in July in Denver, CO. It will be an event you won't want to miss. Due to popular demand, we made a number of significant changes in the MUFON UFO Journal and have more planned for next year. The response has been very positive. For the first time. people have been purchasing multiple copies of some issues to share with friends and co-workers. As a part of our continuous improve- ment process, we have commissioned a redesign of the MUFON web site. The new site will debut in a few weeks. The media have been good to MUFON this year. We have been featured in a number of newspaper articles, radio pro- grams, and television specials, and the coverage has been positive and well re- ceived. Recognizing the need for greater unity in this field, MUFON has met with repre- sentatives of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), National UFO Reporting Cen- ter (NUFORC), National Institute for Dis- covery Science (~NIDS), and others to see where we can work together for greater success in the future. While we are all structured differently and have different strengths, we all have the same goal of finding answers, and greater cooperation can assure success in this work. MUFON will celebrate its 35 th birthday in 2004. That is an outstanding record for a volunteer-based organization. All of you, our members and friends, have made this possible. With your help this work will continue until the UFO mystery is solved. Thank you for your loyal sup- port and hard work.
