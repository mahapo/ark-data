Wiley and Dan Glover LANGENBURG (Staff) - If flying saucers are your cup of tea, Edwin Fuhr has a six-place setting for you. At least he did have...and still does, sort of. It all started about 10:30 a.m. a week ago Sun- day when the 36-year-old farmer was swathing a rapeseed field about six miles north of Langen- burg. \"The rape was lying real flat so I was moving slow to pick it up, not watching where I was go- ing. But I knew I was getting near the slough and would have to\"turn up on another row so I looked up. \"At first I thought it was one of those tin duck blinds like you see in that outdoor sports- man magazine. I thought maybe my brother-in-law had set it up as a joke. I got off the swather and was going over to give it a kick to scare whoever was in it.\" But Edwin never got closer than 15 feet away from his \"duck blind.\" \"All of a sudden like, I noticed the grass was moving... turning near this thing. I just watched it for about two minutes and then noticed that the whole thing was turning. \"I backed up slow. I wasn't going to turn my back on the thing. When I got back up on the swather I noticed there were another four to the left of me, all revolving. I just froze on the seat and didn't move.\" For the next 15 minutes Edwin sat motionless watching the five • \"stainless steel\" objects hovering about a foot off the ground. He wanted to take off on the swather but he couldn't make his hand move to the gear lever.- He wanted to run, but his legs wouldn't move. \"I was terrified. I froze...couldn't do any- thing,\" he said. \"Then they took off...straight up. There was a grey vapor' coming from underneath them and- a strong downwind. I had to hang on to my hat and it knocked the rape down.\". It took two minutes for the objects to dis- appear into the clouds and another two minutes for Edwin to again descend from the swather. \"I wanted to be sure they were gone.\" . Cautiously, he walked over to the outer rim of the slough. Beneath the spot where he had seen the first hovering object, there was a depression in the foot-high grass about 11 feet in diameter. The grass on the outside was flattened and twisted in a clockwise ring. In the center, it stood erect. Then he found four more circular depressions where the other objects had been spinning. \"I felt the grass to see if it was warm. There I/' feel and there wasn't any showed up at the they'd seen these these rings said Const. was nothing you could : smell.\" Edwin figured he'd done enough swathing for the morning and headed back to the farmhouse for lunch . : , \"I didn't know how to tell my folks. The wife just stared at me and said I was nuts. Mother wouldn't believe it at all but had figured I'd seen something.\" Word started getting around, the way it does in rural communities where almost everybody is related, and on Monday, Const. Ron Morier from the Langenburg RCMP detachment Fuhr farm. \"They took me out to where things in the slough grass. I saw about 10 to 12 feet in diameter,\" Morier.  . \"Something was there and I doubt it was a hoax. There's no indication .anything had been wheeled in or out and Mr. Fuhr seemed 'genuinely scared.\" The RCMP gathered all the information they could, including photographs and measurements, and sent the material to the Upper Atmosphere Re- search Section, Astro-Physics Branch, National Research Council, in Ottawa. been no word from the council. \"Some farmers are afraid to work the fields,\" Const. Morier said. \"At least thats what I hear on coffee row.\" Could the objects return? According to Mr. Fuhr, they did. Or at least one of them did. A neighbor's dog started barking Sunday about midnight and kept it up until 3 a.m. \"The people who owned the dog said they could- n't stop him from barking and that he kept look-', ing over here,\" Mr. Fuhr said. No one . saw anything that night , but Monday morning when Mr. Fuhr returned to the site, there was a sixth ring; exactly the same as the. others. He figures that since word started getting a-.. round about the landing, 2,000 people have tramp- led through, over and around the circular depres- sions. But they are still there and very visible. \"It was Friday before Mom would even go have a look,\" Mr. Fuhr said. \"They all believe it now and Mom figures It's about time to move into town.\" As yet there has"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Near Lagunilla, Spain Man claims humanoids pursued him Date of Sighting: March 20, 1974 & March 21, 1974 Location: On the Highway between Horcajo and Lagunilla, SPAIN Name of Newspaper: \"Daily of Cadiz\" March 30, 1974 Translated by: Bill Armstrong Submitted by: Sr. Pedro Redon, MUFON Represen- tative for Spain, through Joe Brill, Inter- national Coordinator. Salamanca--A young truck driver has been pur- sued by four beings which had climbed down from several UFO's, according to his report: During two consecutive nights and in the same place, in the district around Valdehijaderos ; of this province, a young truck driver has seen several UFO's, and on one of the occasions he got out of the truck, which had been stopped, and was pursued by four beings which he could see. Maximilliano Iglesias, 21 years old, who has a reputation for truthfulness in the town of La- gunilla, where he lives, declares that he is not lying. The young truck driver--in an interview publi- shed today by \"La Gaceta Regional\" (Regional GSL-. zette)—says that several days ago he was return- ing at 2 a.m. toward Lagunilla. When close to Valdehijaderos, next to Bejar, he was dazzled by a powerful light, which he thought might be com- ing from some truck, so he switched on his head- lights for passing; but in a short time in a distance of two hundred meters he observed stop- ped on the highway a strange object \"like a plate placed on top of another large and round one\"; at some 15 or 20 meters, also stopped, he saw in the air another similar apparatus. From the one that was parked on the highway emerged two beings, one of which pointed to the truck. They returned into the apparatus and the latter rose up, going away with the one which was stopped in the air. The truck did not get going until after a while. On arriving home the young man went to bed frightened and told nothing about it on the following day. That same day he had to return later to bring material along the same road, and on returning to Lagunilla at about 11:30 p.m. at the same place as the previous day, he again encountered three ships stopped on the highway. They (ships) were of a silvery color and had a diffused, glowing light. \"I stopped the engine,\" Maximilliano has said. \"The truck was not moving. I got out of the cab. Suddenly, I saw four figures out there. I don't know if they were already out or if they came out. I didn't know if they were men or women. They came toward me. On seeing them I ran away frightened. I took off in the direction of Hor- cajo across country. They were following me. They were running much faster than I. I was be- coming exhausted and I was able to throw myself in a ditch full of mud. They passed by me very closet-about two meters--without seeing me. I saw them pass. They were tall, about two meters and they had aims and legs, but their faces I could not see. I did not hear any voices at all. On seeing them pass in the distance, I returned to the truck. I remembered that I left the door open and it was closed now. I thought that some- one was inside and so I approached slowly and looked in. I didn't see anyone in there. I don't remember if it was cold or hot. Imagine how -I must have felt. I again saw them in the distance and they were looking at me again. They pointed with their arms. They climbed into the ships and they took off. Then, I saw them again come down and get out with some tools which I could not make out. With these tools they were making some holes. And at last they went away. The truck could not move since it had a damaged battery.\" On the following day the truck driver related what had happened and the Civil Guard (the local police) began an investigation into the case. On returning to the place of the occurrence there was found a hole which the truck driver claimed he had not made. \"It is true, everything I say,\" added Maximiliano Iglesias. \"Why would I lie? Anyone can believe me that wants to. I did not have any idea about this. I don't remember many details, but indeed I noticed that on taking 5f the ships gave off a loud sound, a strong whist- le, which for a moment left me deaf. Now, I have calmed down and I can only say one thing: If on that second night instead of going alone, I had gone with someone else and if he had been braver, I would not have run away. I would have stayed to see what would have happened.\" 1974 MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS The 1974 MUFON Symposium Proceedings is avail- able postpaid for $3.25 in the U.S. and $4.00 elsewhere.

SUMMARY: An apparent UFO was seen over the city of Simi Valley, Calif. (Los Angeles suburb) at approximately 11:45 p.m. PDT on 19 June 1974. The unknown was seen by at least five groups of people and one group, the Gonzales family of Mission Hills, Calif., experienced a relatively close approach from the UFO. LOCATION: Primarily over the central portion of Simi Valley, Calif., located approximately 33 miles NNW of central Los Angeles. The area of most of the sighting activity was within the boundaries of Cochran, Erringer, Royal and Se- quoia .streets.  • . . WEATHER: Clear and. moderately warm. No ap- preciable inversion layer which usually occurs at this time of year locally. The stars were.spark- ling. There was no moon and no appreciable wind. WITNESSES: Mr. and Mrs. Ted (Patti) Fair, 1720 Regan Circle, Simi Valley, Calif. 93063, (805) 526-0600; Mr. and Mrs. George (Martha) Gonzales, 14674 Hiawatha St., -Mission Hills, Calif. 91315, (213) .365-6530; Several members of the Simi Valley Police Dept., including the watch comman- der; A relative of Mrs. Gonzales, above, who -is a commercial airline pilot and wishes to .remain anonymous. The author of this document tried several times to get information from this source but was refused; and unknown persons who turned in the initial UFO report to the Simi Valley police. . SIGHTING BY MR. AND MRS. FAIR At approximately 11:45 p.m. after the last of the late news on TV. Mrs. Ted (Patti) Fair turned on her police monitor . radio and heard a request from the police radio dispatcher to have a police unit check out a report of a UFO over nearby Brower St. She went outside and scanned the hor- izons without seeing anything. When she looked overhead, she saw a stationary red disc. She ob- served the device for perhaps a minute before her husband, Ted, became curious and joined her.. He too, saw the object and both described it as a \"stop light\" red disc with an apparent diameter of a 3/8\" diameter button held at arm!s lenght. While Ted watched the UFO, Patti went back in the house and phoned the Simi Valley police, who said that they were also aware of the strange de- vice and were observing it from the police sta- tion near the corner of Cochran and Sequoia Sts. After being observed for another minute or so, the object started to move slowly to the ENE and then quickly disappeared over the local horizon with great speed in approximately 5 to 8 seconds. The local horizon was estimated at 20 degrees from the point where they were standing in the street. During the movement of the UFO away from Ted Fair, he said that he observed two filaments of light that protruded from each side of the UFO as if they were the leading edges of swept back type wings of a conventional aircraft. The bril- liance of the object was comparable to that of the moon...it was that of a \"red stop light.\" The UFO made no noise...absolutely silent. A teenage neighbor girl (Joyce) also saw the device about the time it disappeared, but she ap- peared very shy and was reticent about answering questions. : Mrs. Fair went into the house and monitored the police again and the very next call she heard was from an unknown • woman who was driving north on Yosemite St. north of Los Angeles St. who re- ported a gasoline type fire spread across the street behind her at approximately Los Angeles St this she observed in her rear view mirror'. She made a U turn and went back to check; there was no evidence of fire. This event could be seemingly related to the UFO sighting. The author checked with a fireman stationed in Simi Valley several nights later as to any strange fires that night...he could not recall any. SIGHTING BY GONZALES FAMILY On the same date, 19 June, 1974, and at ap- proximately the same time.. .'..11:50 to 11:55 p.m. the Gonzales were driving north on Sycamore St. towards Los Angeles St..in Simi Valley. They had been visiting relatives on Rosette St. and were returning home to Mission Hills in the San Fer- nando Valley. As they neared the bridge near Elizondo Ave., George remarked about the heli- copter, as it had no other lights and was all red (described as the color of an emergency road flare) and very bright. It could be seen clearly through the front windshield at a 45 degree angle, and was noted by Mr. Gonzales as well as their seven-year-old son...(the child seemed to be very frightened by the event). They stopped the car and shut off the engine and could hear no sound. Goerge estimated the altitude at this time at 1000 feet...and the light was noted as round and bright and very red. They decided to drive to a market down the.'' road\" and call Martha's brother-in-law, who was a commercial airlines pilot, thinking he would be. interested in this thing and could possibly tell them what it was. They continued driving to the corner of Los Angeles and Sycamore Sts. to a Ralph's supermarket and called her brother-in-law from a phone booth outside the market. As they drove to the market, a distance of approximately % mile from the bridge, they noted that the UFO- seemed to converge with them at the intersection.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"BK DOUX ET SES AMIS KEN MEAUX-EARL COMEAUX SORRY. REGULAR CUSTOMERS OAJLY! The UFO approached their position in a somewhat undulating motion up and down and eventually came directly overhead while they were making the phone call. Mrs. Gonzales talked for several minutes to her ih-laws, and several persons from the Rosette St. vantage saw the device, some 1^ miles from the Gonzales location. At the time of closest approach, Mr. Gonzales estimated that the UFO came to within 600 feet of them. The Gon- zales (both) estimated the apparent diameter at this time as that of a softball held,at arm's length...a large apparent diameter. -The Gonzales were questioned at length relative to this close approach. The Simi Valley police and the Fairs may have seen the obj ect at the same time...this could be possible based on the approximate time, and the fact that Mrs. Fair called the police and they said that they were observing it at the same time as the Fairs. Cal- culations were made based on the sighting data from the two locations, and the UFO diameter and altitude came out to the following: UFO altitude of the Fair house - 12,500 feet. UFO diameter - 157 feet. The foregoing was based on the watch comman- der's estimate of the elevation angle of approx- imately 60 deg. The UFO diameter appears to be .large compared to most previous reports (but not impossible.)- By taking the above UFO diameter .and working •backwards, one can estimate the distance away from the Gonzales at the closest approach and the time of their first sighting. In the case where the Gonzales first observed the UFO directly a- head and somewhere near Los Angeles Street, George estimated the apparent diameter at a half dollar at arm's length. The horizontal dis- tance computes to approximately 3750 feet or ap- proximately 0.7 miles; when this is spotted on .the map; it puts the UFO over the .intersection of Wisteria and Larch Streets and close to Brower St. This position could certainly be subsequent to the Fair and Simi Valley police locations if the device suddenly dropped in altitude between the two previous locations. In the second case where the UFO approached the Gonzales family at the supermarket,, it was estimated that the device came within 950 feet, certainly a very close ap- proach for so large an object. At this point Mrs. Gonzales : said: \"My little boy had to go to the rest room...he was shaken up. We started running after we had hung up the phone (phone call to her brother-in-law) to the service station rest room. As we were running, I turned around to see if it was still there and the light spun around and flickered...my boy said 'It's taking off! It took off towards the west. It shot off like a shooting star and then came straight at the earth!...we thought it would crash into the earth... and there was going to be some kind of explosion. There might be some kind of radiation so let's get out of here.\" . The object at this time ultimately disappered by rising and dropping in a ballistic type tra- jectory some distance away. They estimated that it disappeared in several seconds. Mrs. Gonzales said that as it moved away initially that she noticed a spinning and pulsing white light around the periphery (along with.the overall red light) ....in a CCW direction when looking up. Mr. Gon- zales remarked that he thought the UFO left some kind of a trail, like a comet: \"We felt that when we started running towards the service station that we frightened it... it hung around so long until we started running. I think it sensed that we were watching it. We did not notice anyone else looking at the strange thing although we saw several other people near"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Continued from preceding page) the supermarket and Union service station.\" SIGHTING BY SIMI VALLEY POLICE Evidently several members of the .Simi Valley police department observed the UFO before and during the time that the Fairs were spotting it. The police were originally alerted by persons un- known as indicated by the original radio trans- mission to any unit to check the UFO over Brower St. and then during the Fair sighting by Mrs. Fair who phoned in. At this time, the police said, \"We know, we are observing it right now.\" The watch commander admitted that he saw.a red light in a SW direction and estimated it to be over Los Angeles St. at approximately 60 degrees elevation. This was approximatly 11:45 p.m. on 19 June, 1974. Several members of the police stationed at the central station observed the de- vice. From the area of the parking lot where the watch 'commander stood,, there was unobstructed view toward the west and SW. The watch commander stated that the UFO disappeared in a SW direc- tion; i.e., towards the Pacific Ocean, and in 5 to 10 seconds. This direction does not correlate with the Fair's direction and essentially was the exact opposite. This could only happen if the device dropped close to earth between the two vantage points which were approximately 7000 feet apart. The descriptions of departures of the Fairs and police seem- to indicate that the UFO disappeared over the local horizon many miles away. This could have been an illusion, perhaps, if the UFO had dropped to a low altitude between the two locals as evidence by the Gonzales in- formation which'indicates that this indeed did happen. The time correlations between the three sightings are not exact and probably no closer than +5 minutes. One area of concern was the watch commander's estimate of the elevation angle of the UFO. If this was in error, and he overestimated to the extent that the angle was only 45 degrees instead of 60 degrees, the UFO altitude over the Fair's house is approximately 8000 feet and the diameter reduces to approximately 100 feet. This note of a possible error is not intended to indicate that the watch commander erred, but points out what a change of this magnitude does to the calculation herein. CONCLUSIONS This sighting appeared to be a true unknown (UFO) based on multiple and \"unknown to each other\" type witnesses. The UFO was described as intelligently con- trolled, curious, silent, stop light red and road flare red, capable of disappearing in several seconds, circular (disk shaped). Additional light effects were noted during acceleration. The di- ameter of the UFO was probably 100 to 150 feet. , .' • .'COMMENTS : As an investigator in this sighting, I must state some beliefs and personal opinions. This incident seen by upwards of 20 people could,not have been\" contrived. I believe in the sincerity of the people that I interviewed and was some- what concerned over the effect on the Gonzales... they appeared to be ,awed by the event. I do not think- that the Gonzales had any preconceived notions- one way or the other, nor were they especially well read on UFOs. The Fairs, ..on the Other hand, were more casual, although .they got excited during parts of their interview. I be- lieve that this sighting impressed them and I sensed that\" they believed that \"UFOs could ex- ist\" prior to this sighting. Each had read an early book by Keyhoe. Ted Fair had sought me out the day after their sighting, knowing that there was someone at the place where we both worked who was interested in UFOs. Ultimately he found me and I .requested an interview after he described what they had seen. Several days later,'I was contacted by. the SKYNET part of MUFON in Southern California and : it \"was suggested by Mrs. Ann Druffel that I contact the Gonzales. At'the time I did not know that the two sightings were related. During the Gonzales interview, I requested'that I be able to talk to her brother-in-law since he would be able to fill in with valuable details about the close approach phase. However, for reasons not known to me, he does not want to, or cannot for good reason, dis- cuss this event. • Another peculiar aspect of this event was the attitude of the Simi Valley police. They were very suspicious at first of .the investigation, and would not allow a tape recording to be made. The first question to me was, \"Are you govern- ment men?\" Not that they : are not prepared for crime and related activities, but I think there is no overall plan for-UFO types of complaints. The watch commander mentioned something about an Air Force (or Marine)\" officer who was nosing a- round Simi Valley after the famous Gary Chopic sighting of October •, 1973. I had the feeling that they .were not telling me all they knew. - - The UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis is offering for sale a 3% x 5 color photo of a UFO color chart. ,A must for all UFO in- vestigators to identify UFO colors displayed as you interview UFO witnesses.

Civilian Argentine airliner flanked by flying saucers' Date of Actual Sighting: March 13, 1974 Location: Somewhere Between San Juan and Cordoba, Argentina Publication: The magazine \"ATOM\" No.4 (June-1974) Submitted by: Joe Brill Translated by: Bill Armstrong On March 13 an aircraft of Argentine Airlines that was making flight 537 from San Juan to Cor- doba, (commanded by Captain Escurra and Retegno), in reaching an altitude of approximately 6,500 meters, were flanked by two UFO's which accord- ing to witnesses from the phosphorescence and other charteristics were \"Flying Saucers.\" Dur- ing several minutes they seemed to accompany the aircraft in its flight, as if they had intentions of studying it, but then they disappeared, at a dizzy velocity. The pilots did not make any statements (once more silence). However the pas- sengers were able to confirm what gave them a thrill. Indiana couple reports close encounter in auto The following report is based on an investi- gation by MUFON Field Investigator Francis L. Ridge of Mt. Vernon, Ind. Mr. and Mrs. Gary (Georgeanne) McCarty were traveling south on Highway 69 between Solitude, Ind., and Farmersville, Ind., toward Mt. Vernon, Ind., on July 30, 1974; when they spotted an ob- ject silhouetted against the moonlit haze. The object, which appeared to be about 1 to 2 miles' away, had a clear shape, with three lights. The object continued toward the McCarty ve- hicle, and the McCartys stopped their car after driving 1.6 miles beyond the point where they first saw the object. According to the witnesses, the object appeared to come to within 50 to 100 feet of the McCarty vehicle, which remained stop- ped for approximately 2 minutes. \"You wouldn't believe how big it was,\" Mr. McCarty told the in- vestigator. The witnesses estimated the diameter of the object at 6 to 7 car lengths, or about 150 feet. The object was now observed to have four lights, rather than the three seen when the ob- ject was first spotted. The lights were describ- ed as being \"like headlights.\" The speed of the object was estimated at \"0 to 20 m.p.h., mostly 5 m.p.h. There was no sound from the object. No additional objects were seen. The object appeared to hover \"like on water,\" ac- cording to the witnesses. Mr. McCarty said he thought the object was going to land, and that the witnesses had scared it off. The McCartys said the object did not appear to interfere with the operation of their vehicle. After observing the object for about two minutes, they continued south on Route 69 for two-tenths of a mile, then stopped again. They had rounded a curve, and the object was not seen again. The total duration of the observation was estimated at 8-10 minutes. The sighting was reported to the county sheriff. New Jersey woman reports UFO made 'grinding sound' ASBURY PARK, N.J., PRESS, March 26, 1974-- Carol Grimes reported seeing a UFO at about 10:30 p.m., March 24, as she was walking •home. \"I heard this grinding sound, something like a motor but unlike anything I had heard before,\" she ex- plained. \"Then I looked up and saw it. There were no lights, but I could see it because the sky was light.\" She said the object was about the size of a helicopter. Miss Grimes said she spotted a couple walking some distance away, and that she looked at them with thoughts of getting additional witnesses, but that the object was disappearing into the night toward Asbury Park when she looked back at it."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"In 'Vienna window' of Austria \"Sparkling wedge' reported By Ernest Berger - Representative for Austria In this article, I will cover additional sight- ings in the \"Vienna window\" area of Austria (see June and July issues of Skylook for previous cases). The next report came from Mrs. T. (name known to author and Skylook), a commercial councillor's widow in her sixties, who lives together with some Japanese lodgers in a detached house at Sim- mering, the llth district of Vienna. Her house is situated 400 meters north of the Vienna Cen- tral Cemetery (1st gate) and 800 meters NW of the crematory. 5 kilometers to the ESE is Vien- na's only refinery, and 5 kilometers further Vienna Airport with its runways, both at Schwe- chat. Mrs. T. is very familiar with the planes passing low over Simmering and Schwechat, and at night they are easily identified by their wingtip and tail lights and the awful roar. The flying object of mid-December, however, was a \"bird of another color.\" The force of habit (her late husband always wanted his first cup of coffee at that time) wakes up Mrs. T. every night between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. GET. In the night of December 12/13, 1973, at 3:08 a.m., out of a sudden impulse--\"! don't know why I did it\"—she jumped to the win- dow to see a \"most fascinating thing\" in the sky. \"It was so beautiful I had to keep my eyes glued to it 'til it disappeared behind some buildings to the southeast. It was sparkling in many colors, mostly blue and red, and had a steady deep blue (color test: ultramarine blue) margin all around. I stood and stared, and when it was gone I said: What a pity!\" The same \"hypnotic light\" that had caught Mrs. Bussweg's eye was now pouring down onto Simmering. Vienna had a perfectly clear sky that night. The full moon to the west was out-shining the starlight. Mrs. T. had no time to pull away the curtain from her sleeping room window (looks into the south), but we made sure the thin fabric can't cloud the view anyway. \"I first thought: Heaven, what's this? It can't be an aircraft. And it was most beautiful, sparkling. A tapering front side and rounded off behind, with a narrow, shiny blue strip all around. I found it strange; the tapering part in front, just the opposite (of an aircraft wing or a fireball plus tail, aerody- namical ly. wrong) . And it was gliding slowly along a straight trajectory, really fascinating. I never saw anything the like. After no more than a minute or so, I lost it from sight. I was dis- appointed .\" In contrast to the steady hem around the \"wedge,\" Mrs. T. saw a definite movement inside margin dots The ^sparkling wedge\" according, to Mrs. T. or on the body: \"The; whole shape. was filled with tiny colored dots and they iredesced .or spark- ed.\" (Compare with Mr. -. Bussweg's statement in \"Hovering Sparkler near Enzesf eld,\"' July,:' Sky- look.) Mrs. T. had some difficulty • to describe it's brightness, \"but\" it had; no ..dazzling effect j it was too much distant.\" We agreed on , full moon. brilliance. The body outline/was sharp, no tail, no rotation or ground illumination effect.- And (of course) no sound. At first sight the \"sparkling wedge\" moved over the top of a weeping willow tree on the other side of the street, azimuth 200° NESW and eleva- tion 27/28°. Its longitudinal axis was in line with the straight trajectory, angle of dip 27° towards the southern horizon. The wedge descended \"at aircraft speed\" and disappeared behind the rooftops of a modern block of buildings at 140° azimuth and 6/7 elevation. A real-time-test done at the site gave a maximum duration of 10 and a minimum of 6 seconds. The striking time dilata- tion effect (Mrs. T. talked about \"a minute or so\" first) adds weight to the strangeness of her encounter. \"I was deeply impressed all the fol- lowing day long,\" she said. Her time and size estimations were more pre- cise: \"When it was gone I looked at the grand- father clock immediately — 8 past 3:00 a.m. (+ 2 or 3 minutes clock variation) . Then I wanted some size reference. I opened the window, leaned out and looked at the full moon (to the west). I'm sure the thing was somewhat smaller than 3 times the full moon- -about two and two thirds.\" A val- uable information. That is about 1° 20/25\" in the sky. It was rather far away and we computed a maximum axial diameter of 58 and a minimum of 62 meters for a supposed distance of 2,5 kilo- meters, somewhere over the Vienna Basin. As usual, there had been no air traffic during the sighting. Whether the \"sparkling wedge\" was only the sub-structure of another object or a long \"teardrop\" with dots all over the surface 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"(that would mean that the blue margin was some kind of \"radiation layer\") is open to specula- tion. But the aerial show was not over. On the night of Friday, Dec. 14, 1973, between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. GET, Mrs.. T. was wide awake again and had just walked out of her sleeping room into the living room, when \"the whole world turned a fiery red.\" The sky was overcast at that time and the color seemed to come from everywhere, illuminating the whole landscape out- side and the clouded sky. Though Mrs.. T. had never heard of the book \"Incident at Exeter\" by John G. Fuller, it seemed as if the Exeter object was now buzzing Eastern Vienna. \"It was horrible—like the end of the world!\" Mrs. T. looked out of the southern window, then ran across the blood red room and the corridor to peer out of the latticed back door into the garden. \"An awful beauty—the whole sky red, the houses, the ground, only the bare trees pitch- black, but without a shadow.\" From somewhere diffuse light seemed to pour ..through the cloud cover. Mrs. T. had the distinct feeling that it was coming from above. In a real-time test done with Mrs. T. we timed 20 seconds for the \"red period..\" Then the red light went out suddenly and everything was dark. \"I tried to listen to a thunder, but there wasn't any.\" After a minute or so, a blue light of the same intensity was \"switched on.\" It lasted for about 16 seconds (real-time-test) and Mrs. T. watched it with growing amazement--or fright; she did not admit she was frightened during the whole epi- sode. \"It really must have been some kind of supernatural phenomenon. I know I should have gone outdoors to make sure what it was, but, you see, it was very cold and the rule of the jungle didn't allow me to do so. I thought of atomic bombs and ball lightning...\" We asked her to show the colors in the color table, and they were nearly the same as the vivid colors of the \"sparkling wedge\" the night before: a scarlet red and some kind of \"washing blue\" or cobalt blue, pale cobalt blue, to tell it exactly. Both were \"bright as moonlight, but much more intensive.\" The blue disappeared suddenly and the night was dark again. Mrs. T. believed the nightmare was gone and went to the W. C. (bathroom). She saw another light through the window--\"Maybe it was yellow. And when I came out again, it.was gone. The dark intervals between the light phenomena had the same fixed duration every time, a minute or so.\" Mrs. T. walked back into the living room and looked out into the south. The next light ap- peared. \"It was far away to the .south, all red, below the line.\" The arc of light above the southern horizon (Vienna Basin) reached up to an electrical cable (the \"line\") on the other side of the street and somewhat higher, not much. Ele- vation of the cable measured from T. living room window: 8 . \"I thought: now it's goin* away.\" The light went out and the witness entered the kitchen. \"I firmly believed it wouldn't return-- but it did, after the same peri'od of darkness.\" This time Mrs. T. got a shock and did not notice the color, \"but it was across the whole sky, the same thing. And that was the end.\" The kitchen window looks out into the west, the back door window into the north (so does the W.C. win- dow) and the living and sleeping room windows in- to the south. Mrs. T. was sure the 5 sky lights had covered the whole hemisphere. With a last sentence of amazement (or resignation): \"Heaven, every night a thing like this!\" she went to bed again. The following morning she went shopping and met a neighbor. She risked to ask him about the \"thunderstorm.\" \"No, haven't seen such. You see, I'm sleeping at night,\" he remarked, \"but a woman in the supermarket complained of it. It had frightened her to .death, she said, changing lights, illuminating everything. She had thought something was blowing up.\" 5 kilometers from Schwechat refinery that's no silly thought. There are some fireworks in Prater (second district, a- cross. the Danube channel) every year, but not that day and certainly not at 3-4:00 a.m. No fire was reported in the area, no air crash either. No noise was heard during the \"thunderstorm.\" Mrs. T. has no radio, and her TV set was switched off during the sighting. Mrs. T. was no ideal witness, somewhat talka- tive and careless. Her interest in a scientific investigation was only temporary. She refused rather roughly to answer two additional questions at the site about a month later. However, we ar- rived at the conclusion that her observations had a real background. She wanted no publicity and her.vivid descriptions (though somewhat funny) proved to be illustrative and intelligent for us during the 3-hour interview. To fabricate and tell a story like that without the twinkling of an eye is too much for an average Vienna brain. The Schwechat airport weather data were consis- tent with Mrs. T.'s claims. December 12/13 night clear, -8 centigrade, wind SE 14 km/hour. Decem- ber 13/14 night sky overcast, wind SW 25 km/hour, showers in the morning. But what about other witnesses? The Japanese lodgers had not seen it and laughed at Mrs. T.'s \"imagination.\" But Mrs. T. had a back-up and she told it right away: \"Mr. S. (let's call him-S.) has watched it, too. He said it to me a few days after my own observation.\" CORROBORATION- A \"COLOR PUZZLE\" Mr. S., a pensioned electrician of 54 years, lives in an old, detached house only 100 meters from Mrs. T.'s. He had not attributed any weight to his sighting (\"I saw, was amazed, and forgot it\") but it proved to be valuable indeed. After some persuasion on the phone he agreed with us to \"unearth\" the whole story again at the site. Mr. S. also wakes up at about 4:00 a.m. regu- larly and this old habit made him a witness of 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(Continued from preceding page) the \"color spectacle.\" It happened about a'week before he met Mrs..T. and he was sure the sky had been cloudless at that night. Together with the Schwechat data it gives us a clue about possible dates: for .Simmering the only clear nights be- fore Christmas 1973 were December 10/11, 12/13 (the \"wedge\") and 18/19. We were eager to hear his report: \"It was a clear nieht and I was wide awake at 4:00 a.m. Suddenly there was a flash outside the bedroom window (1st story, closed window, looking into the NNE). It was the moment I stepped out of my bed and I heard no sound at all. The wall of the house nearby reflected something very bright that --well, must have been in the Vienna Woods region, to the west. Now what's goin' on there, I thought, and quickly rushed out into,the kit- chen, opened the window and there I saw it.\" The kitchen window looks out into the SSW, and the \"thing\" stood over the WSW horizon. It illum- inated the whole countryside, the scattered houses and backyards as far as Mr. S. could see. And it looked immaterial—some kind of arc rising gradually at 220 azimuth NESW and up to an elec- trical cable at 230 , from elevation zero to 5 or 6 maximum. The arc was resembling a \"rainbow on the ground,\" but without the typical color .stripes. Mr. S.: \"I can't tell you the number or names of the colors involved, I only looked at it as a whole. It was intensive, a composition of blended rainbow-colors. You see, colored spaces merging into a whole, like some aqua- relle.\" To say it more popularly—a huge \"color puz- zle\" with lots of colors, chiefly red and orange, rested on the horizon in the Vienna Woods direc- tion. The glaring light did not dazzle Mr. S. He compared it to a stage illumination: \"Like brilliant colored floaters, switched on by some unknown assistant. A quiet picture, really rest- full. And it disappeared like a welding arc— power switch-off, arc collapses and is gone.\" (Compare patterns with Enzesfeld \"sparkler\" and Mt. Anninger incident following). Now we asked two questions: Was it a source of light itself or a reflection from something? Was it like an aurora borealis? Mr. S. replied straightforward: \"Yes, it was luminous. But you, may compare it to the fuzzy glow of some truck headlights approaching you at night on the highway, and behind some hilltop. You'll see an arc of light growing larger, luminous, and the moment you'll reach the hilltop it collapses. With one difference, and that's the movement.\" The \"rainbow arc\" was steady and showed no move- ment or intensity variation whatsoever. Question two: \"No. No chance to distinguish between the colors of the arc at a glance, but you can do it in case of a northern light.\" The streetcar line of Simmeringer Hauptstrasse (main street) runs along 100 meters from S's house, but there are no streetcars in operation at 4:00 a.m. Without a streetcar you can't produce sparks (the explanation was first suggested by Mrs. T.). S. saw no planes approaching Schwechat, either. We timed the sighting. From S's first look to the \"switch-off\" moment the \"puzzle\" had been shining at least 15 and definitely not more than 30 seconds. The frame of the kitchen window cuts out the sky at 240/250° azimuth, but S. was sure the \"puzzle\" had continued into the west, maybe northwest, sector. Mr. S. talked about it with other persons, but (we have already mentioned it) he did not attribute any value to it and could not remember other witnesses' names. Like Mrs. T. he had also a second sighting in store for us. It's no spectacular one, but a necessary piece to our puzzle: ...AND A \"WELDING ARC\" Some days after the \"color puzzle event,\" Mr. S. went for a walk with his dog at about 7 or 7:30 p.m. He walked along Udelweg, a quiet lane with front gardens to the left and right, near his house. Approaching a bend to the left he saw the lights of central Vienna shining at the west- ern horizon.behind a gate and some bushes of the adjacent backyard. It was the direction towards the Vienna Woods again. Suddenly the dark sky flashed up \"like a bright welding arc.\" It shone much more brilliant than the \"color puzzle,\" a dazzling light. \"But I was not dazzled, because it did not shine right at me but into the sky.\" One could see a flat- tened semicircle of brilliant sky again, quiet light, no movement etc. No sharp edges—the light power came to an end gradually at about 7 ele- vation, above the brushtops of the garden and a garage. It was a glaring white, like \"super sum- mer lightning,\" but without variations of bright- ness. 5 or 10 seconds later it collapsed the same way as the \"puzzle.\" The. time was enough to as- certain it's azimuth—we measured 270/280 for it's point of zero elevation to the north and it's left part was cut off at 250 by the house. If we remember the maximum elevation of the \"color puzzle arc\"—5/6 —and compare the azimuth lines we have to realize it was another color, but the same arc, originating from the same un- known spot in the direction of the Vienna Woods. The sky was clear and Mr. S. is familiar with planes, as Mrs. T. It could not have been a simple beacon or running light, and a welding arc a city block away won't light up the sky at 7°. We said good-bye to Mr. S. and wondered what was going to happen next in the \"Vienna Window.\" The Case For the UFO (Annotated Fassimile Edi- tion) Dr. M. K.

A large number of the better sightings have been origin- ating in the mountainous areas, and have occurred during the early morning hours. During the early morning hours of. July 13 a number of calls were received from the Pittsburgh area, reporting a large dirigible-shaped object with a red light on the bottom that was moving east of the city. On July 20 at 12:55 p.m. a resident of the South Hills section of Pittsburgh observed a long white elliptical-shaped object hover among the clouds for several minutes before disappearing out of sight at a high rate of speed. On July 20 and again on July 24 there were a number of reports of bright yellow lights hovering over the state game lands near Ligonier, Pa. At 3 a.m.\" on the morning of Aug. 12 a family near Latrobe observed a large oval-shaped object that appeared \"as large as the fuselage of a large jet plane.\" The object had rotating red, white, and green lights moving around the outside of the main structure. During the early morning hours of Aug. 13 and 14, reports were received from West. Mifflin of a formation of four bright white rings moving in a V configuration. On-Aug. 21, between 9:25 and 10 p.m., a small UFO flap occurred in Allegheny, Westmoreland, and Fayette counties. Most witnesses reporting ob- serving from one to three bright orange spherical objects that were visible in some areas up to 15 minutes. One report from White Hall in Allegheny County stated that the bright orange-yellow ob- ject, which looked diamond-shaped, appeared to be the diameter of the Sun, according to the wit- ness. After several minutes it decreased to the size of a star, then moved out of sight. Several residents of West Point City watched a bright orange light hover near Pleasant Unity. As it moved closer toward them, it increased in size and became a dome shape with a bright orange beam of light on the bottom. There have been increases in creature activity since the end of July. We presently have several reliable reports, and many rumors of sightings are being followed up. In June two witnesses were shocked to see a \"Bigfoot\"-like creature standing near a parked car in a residential sec- tion near Greensburg. The creature was described as being about 6 feet tall and covered with dark hair. The creature was hunched over and never stood straight up. The eyes appeared to have a red glow to them; That was the only feature that could be seen in the face area. The arms and legs appeared very long. One of the witnesses Dave Baur, a Westmoreland UFO Study Group member, watches.over the group's displays- at the SLYBAC Control Open House at Saltsburg, Pa. The UFO group, directed by Stan Gordon, has its head- quarters at Greensburg, Pa. screamed, and the creature started to walk slowly toward her. It made a loud sound which the wit- nesses said sounded like \"when a dog has some- thing caught in its throat.\" When the creature continued to approach the observers, they both screamed. The creature then turned around and with very large steps went down behind a house into a wooded area. In July, several three-toed footprints were found near a creek in the same area where this creature had been seen. UFO investigators should be very cautious when investigating sightings of bright orange objects, similar to oversized stars, that move slowly across the sky, then suddenly begin to drop what look to be flares. In many cases these will turn out to be hot air balloons. On the night of July 7, between the hours of 9:50 and 10:43 p.m. the police departments as well as the UFO control center had their hands full checking into such reports. Apparently someone was launching the devices not far from the Jeanette area, and they were being carried by wind currents towards Greensburg. State and City police were deluged with calls reporting the sightings. One police officer near Mt. Odin Park reported that one of the lights passed low-over his head, and that he could hear a crackling sound. This would indi- cate that the plastic was burning. When the de- vices are airborne, however, they can look quite unusual and fool even an experienced observer. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"UFO's Behind the Iron Curtain Again, I would like to thank Jeno Miklos, the MUFON Representative for Romania, for sending to me the following information. Also, my sincere appreciation to Dimtru Ichim of Ontario, Canada, for his fine translation of this material for MUFON. The following information was published in the March 9, 1974, issue of the magazine \"Flacara\" (The Flame) of Bucharest, Romania: • At dawn, on Feb. 8/ n 1974, a few\" minutes after sunrise, ten girl students .from the Children's Home in Valenii Munte were the witnesses of an amazing show: They observed from the dormitory window, in the direction of-the village-of Bughea de Jos (which is a distance of approximately two kilometers), two yellow-orange, incandescent spheres over a grove of trees which are relativ- ely close to the dormitory building. Those two spheres (or discs) the girls observ- ed were hovering motionless just above the tree tops and they were covered by a jelly-like (gela- tine) halo, transparent, egg-yolk like. After about fifteen seconds (as it was verified by tests performed on each student), the two spheres approached one another very slowly, fused and took on an ellipsoidal form (shape). The new object, in an apparent size of approx- imately twenty-five centimeters (ten inches) at arm's length (hence the real size was calculated thereafter at being seven meters (twenty-three feet), .kept the same color and white-like cover- ing. Then, suddenly, the strange object began to shift slowly towards the southwest and unexpect- edly increased considerably its speed and disap- peared. After the disappearance of this bright object, there remained for awhile over the tree line a kind of milky fog, and the sky which until that time was-covered by clouds became clear in a very short time. Professor Calin Turcu, from whom this data was secured, arrived there an hour after the event had occurred. Taking into consideration and put- ting the witnesses' statements to the test, he succeeded in fixing the zone of the supposed ex- traterrestrial vehicle, using the point of obser- vation for this particular case at one of the dormitory windows. In the company of those ten witnesses he started to walk straight to the des- ignated place where the object had been seen. Behind the tree line there were found two fresh traces in the ground; a sort of concave little ditches similar to those left by a motor vehicle slipping. Being a ploughed field, the traces By Joe Brill which were found could not have been made by any- thing other than a tractor. Anyway, for awhile, this was the first opinion of the researcher. Then some strange details incredibly complicated these first conclusions. First, the gauge (the distance between the parallel ground markings) of those two \"tires\" was much too great to have been made by a trac- tor. Second, the ground was not settled, as naturally it is supposed to be under the pressure of the tires spinning around on the same place. Thirdly, nothing was found to show any sign that the \"tractor\" once having escaped from the muddy ground went on ahead. It must also be mentioned that a spot of strange green liquid was found in each of these ground markings. And, even more arguments for stimulating us to formulate the fantastic presumtion that the ob- ject, with a changeable geometry, landed right here by a row of trees. As a matter of fact it was not the first time we were witnesses to uni- dentified flying objects in that part of our country. The six days prior, on Saturday afternoon, Feb. 2, 1974, an incandescent object was observed hovering over Teleajen Valley and Chiosdurilor Depression, being seen by literally hundreds of people. Professor Calin Turcu, a scholar and a pas- sionate researcher of UFO's, visited individually Drajna de Jos, Ogretin, Posesti, Tiriesti, Car- bunesti, Valea Plopului, Valea Sorejii, Star- chiojd, where he has interviewed over 300 people and has taken 80 written statements. This time : again, the witnesses' statements regarding the flight of a bright object, shifting direction and I the time of actual visual observation, were a i surprising coincidence. The supposed space vehicle, which was of a i yellow-orange color, this time had an ellipsoidal shape similar to a cigar. It flew through the sky with an unbelievable speed, was covered in a greenish halo and emitted a j et of sparks through the end of a sharp tail. Looking skyward, loam A. Turcu (15 years old) declared: \"I saw toward! the place where the sun had gone down a light which suddenly stopped. It was similar to a mag- nesium flame. Then it took the shape of an egg; of blue color and it was very bright and had a long tail following behind it.\" Another youth, Constantin Cojocaru (16 years old), described it as: \"An object with an el- lipsoidal shape, sharp to the extremities, of a bright white color, having below a red-orange 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The drawings of the school girl, Miranela Burtoiu, features the appearance, the form, and the merging of the two incandescent spheres which were observed in the early morning hours of Fri- day, February 8, 1974, near the village of Bughea de Jos, Romania. , prominence spinning very rapidly.\" Here is the narration of Professor Valariu Sirbu from Valenii de Munte: \"On Saturday, Feb_. 2, at about 6 p.m. I observed a bright phenomena of pink-orange color shifting over the city sky from west to east. The object had an ellipsoidal shape and it had an intense light and was shift- ing with a dizzy speed.\" Alexandru Grigorescu, the superintendent of the \"Nicolae lorga\" High School had the idea the space vehicle had a rocket shape -emitting from one end a jet flame; and Gh. Chesculescu, a driver from Starchiojd village, saw it as green with a bright red tail. What about all these strange phenomena des- cribed above, on the testimonies of so many eye witnesses? Hallucinations or common psychosis? It's hard to accept or believe that, as (so many of them are children or country people) they haven't heard all their lives about the supposed existence of UFO's. The-objects they have seen, were they not ball lightning made by electromag- netic phenomena, meteors, balloons, strange cloud formations, new types of airplanes or remnants of rockets previously sent into earth orbit. Obviously, at this time there is no one person of this earth to give us the answer. What is the truth? Who can say for sure. For now, we present \"'the facts and hope that someday we will procure the answer from them.

Combining the dues structure of MUFON member- ship and SKYLOOK subscription as one package will soon be announced in detail. As elaborated- in the September issue of SKYLOOK, the research.and membership services provided by MUFON requires an administrative office secretary on a part or full time basis. This, of course, will result in an increase in the total fee. A new \"Associate Member\" status to MUFON is being proposed for those people who are unable or prefer not to par- ticipate actively in the field investigators or research program, but who want to subscribe to SKYLOOK and help financially in the support of MUFON. The MUFON Board of Directors is cognizant of these needs and - their response has been-very favorable. illustrated UFO in Des Moines on by the Des Moines 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"In Others' Words By Lucius Parish The NATIONAL ENQUIRER continues to lead the field among the weekly tabloids, insofar as re- liable UFO material is concerned. The Sept. 8 issue told of a sighting by airline pilots and air traffic controllers during the Oct. '73 flap; this issue also featured an article on Dr. Frank Salisbury's new book, THE UTAH UFO DISPLAY. The Sept. 22 issue reported on the many UFOs which have been seen near the small Texas town of Calvert in recent years. In the Sept. 27 issue, Dr. David Saunders 1 computer studies of UFO flaps are detailed. NATIONAL TATTLER for Aug. 25 quoted L. J. Lorenzen of APRO as saying the government would soon release information concerning the reality of UFOs. Maybe so, but don't hold your breath! Peter Lorre Jr. told of his UFO sighting in the Sept. 1 TATTLER: Dr. Carl Mclntire related them to religion and prophecies in the Sept. 8 issue; and a recent N.H. sighting investigated by Ray Fowler was featured in the Sept. 29 issue. The Aug. .31 issue of NATIONAL STAR contained several letters from readers, commenting on the STAR'S two-part UFO series in previous issues and telling of their own sightings. NATIONAL INSIDER for Sept. 8 gave additional details concerning Charles Hickson's claims of later contact with Ufonauts, plus an article on the L. J. Lorenzen statements mentioned above. Margaret Mead's opinions on UFOs may be found in the September issue of REDBOOK. Her comments indicate some research into the subject and are well worth reading. The October issue of SAGA contains a round-up article on UFO occupant reports, written by War- ren Smith. Little new material here. The Fall (#3) issue of SAGA'S UFO REPORT is now available. This publication continues to feature interesting material and improves with each issue. THE UFO REPORTER is a new bi-monthly magazine which serves as the official publication of the International UFO Bureau. The first issue is nicely produced and contains some interesting material. A complimentary copy may be obtained by writing to the magazine at P. 0. Box 2656, La Mesa, CA 92041. The subscription rates are $5.00 for 6 issues. F. W. Holiday's book, THE DRAGON AND THE DISC, has now been published in a paperback edition by Popular Library. The title has been changed to CREATURES FROM THE INNER SPHERE; the price is $1.25. Two recent books by Robert Charroux can be ad- ded to the ever-growing list of titles on the subject of \"ancient astronauts.\" Both books, THE GODS UNKNOWN and LEGACY OF THE GODS are available in paperback editions for $1.25 each. It is tempting to say that if you have read one Char- roux book, you've read them all. They all contain material relating to ancient space visitors, At- lantis, Biblical mysteries, UFOs and all the other subjects we've come to associate with this type of literature. Charroux tells of his exper- iences with a \"silent contactee\" who has alleged- ly received a voluminous amount of material— scientific and otherwise—from extraterrestrials. A future book incorporating this information might well be of more interest and value than all the previous Charroux books, so one hopes that the author will consider such a venture. Both of the present books can be obtained from Berkley Publishing Corp., 200 Madison Avenue, N.Y., N.Y. 10016. Another recent paperback from Berkley is Andrew Tomas' TOE HOME OF THE GODS. This is sim- ilar in many respects to Tomas' previous book, WE ARE NOT THE FIRST. Primarily, it is concerned with the Atlantis legend, although material on prehistoric civilizations, legends of space visi- tationsi ect., is included. Tomas seems to be among the more reliable writers on such topics. The book may be obtained from the same address given for the Charroux books; the price is also $1.25. Peter Kolosimo's TIMELESS EARTH is his second volume dealing with mysteries of the past. Un- fortunately, there is little in this book which has not been discussed in the first book or re- hashed endless times by other writers on the same subjects. As with the Charroux books, it is a lengthy admixture of facts and speculations about ancient space visitors and advanced civilizations of the past. Some interesting photographs are included, but this is not sufficient reason to pay $7.95 for the book. If you want a copy, the publisher is University Books, Inc., 120 Enter- prise Ave., Secaucus, NJ 07094. However, I think I'd wait for the inevitable Bantam paperback edi- tion! Many Ufologists probably consider Carl Sagan to be the \"new Menzel.\" That would be an under- standable—and perhaps deserved—picture of the' man. He has been quite the UFO skeptic in recent years and shows no signs of taking the subject more seriously in the future. However, to give credit where it is due, this Cornell University astronomer has produced an interesting look at all aspects of space and space travel in his recent book, THE COSMIC CONNECTION.

Is this: Is Erich von Daniken a fraud? It is a legitimate and difficult question. It has been raised in such recent diverse, publications as Daniel Green's article \"God Flies a Saucer\" in the July 6, 1974, issue of The National Observer, as well as in an interview with von Daniken in Playboy (a member of my congregation showed me the article.)- On July 11, on a nationwide Canadian Broadcasting Company interview, the following statement was put to me: \"Now that Erich von Daniken has been shown to be something of a fraud, will this tend to discredit your work with UFOs and religion?\" We usually think of science as being above fraud. But recently a well respected medical research man was fired for \"painting\" some mice to \"fake\" the results of his cancer research. In fact, that may be only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the whole issue of science and fraud. There have been recent questions raised about the appropriation of funds for scientific research by Congress. How many of these projects are really important, and how many are just .milk- ing taxpayers? How many scientists have been part of the planned \"overruns\" in our military contracts? While people do not expect to find fraud in science, they expect to\"find it in religion. I see ads in cultist magazines which read \"how prayer can make you rich and famous.\" (The way is to sell people books on how prayer can make you rich and famous.) A more common example is the person who worships faithfully every week, but who does not practice any of the values he supposedly worships. Dr. Hugh Schonfield has written the book The Passover Plot, in which he iargues that Jesus never died on the cross. He 'was taken down before he died, and revived by his Idisciples, who then together \"faked\" -the resur- Irection. All this not to mention the \"tent\" religion in America which has often been nothing but a con game. ' Is von Daniken a fraud? The answer is partly the latest findings on the solar system, the in- ?ide story of the \"message plaque\" on the Pioneer iO spacecraft and other such topics, you will en- joy Sagan's book. When you come to the chapter c»n UFOs, just slowly shake your head and grit your teeth (as I did). Sagan's lively style of writing, plus the excellent photos and illustra- tions, make this a pleasureable excursion into the universe. An Anchor Press book, selling for $7.95, THE COSMIC CONNECTION may be obtained from pi>ubleday § Co., Inc., 245 Park Ave., N.Y., N.Y. yes, and partly no. Von Daniken has spent time in jail for some type of tax fraud, of which he claims he, like Jesus, was innocently convicted. Beyond that are the questions of the extravagant claims he makes for the accuracy of the Piri Reis maps, his \"beyond all doubt\" interpretation of the land markings on the Nazaca plains, or for various cave drawings. One of the most damaging things against him involves his more recent book The Gold of the Gods, in which he claimed to have been led by a Mr. Moricz into an underground cave in Peru which was filled with all kinds of extraterrestrial artifacts. Now Mr. Moricz claims he never led von Daniken into any.such cave. Von Daniken says he promised never to tell, then went back on his word. What happened? I can't help but wonder if maybe von Daniken has been conned. Either he was led to a cave which was \"set up\" for him, or he heard a great story about a cave, and just had to print it, true or not. After all, with publishers saying, \"write more, find more,\" and having al- ready covered the earth several times, how much more sensational material could von Daniken find? So, being desperate for new material, I suspect that von Daniken \"bought\" something in Peru that he shouldn't have. Maybe we will never know ex- actly what. One of our temptations in life is to look for quick, simple answers. When they don't come, in frustration we may paint some mice—Jesus called it white washing tombs. Von Daniken notes that if he had written his book in a careful scien- tific style, no one would have bought it. I think he is right. The public wants quick, simple answers. The scientific approach is not simple, nor quick. If von Daniken has conned the public, it is because the public prefers von Daniken to science, or true religion. So when we come down to the fraud charge a- gainst von Daniken, it turns out to be too quick, simple, and unscientific. It is partly true, and partly not true. Von Daniken has asked a question which many people hope goes away: Have space be- ings influenced our past? Since there is no'easy answer, the best thing is to get rid of the man who asked the question, and charge him with fraud. In our own UFO field, we always face fraud. On the one hand, we wonder about government statements about UFOs. If the government is ly- ing, we do not call it fraud, we call it national security. On the other hand, every time someone tells me his UFO story,.! say inside, \"Am I being taken?\" Sometimes I am. People say to me, \"Do you know for sure that UFOs are related \"to the Biblical religion?\" They frown with disappoint- ment when I say, \"I am not sure.\" I would like to say, \"I am sure.\" But that would be fraud. 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Appears to be man-made Steel ball found in Ohio By THEODORE SPICKLER -• Associate Professor of Physics West Liberty. State College MUFON Field Investigator THE SPHERE IS FOUND Keith Hammerman was squirrel hunting on the Southeastern Ohio farm of Ollie Wagner on Satur- day morning, . Sept. 7, when he heard a loud sonic boom'followed by a.sharp crack, then a swishing noise. Then he saw .about 50 feet ahead through the low scrub trees a smoking area and detected a thick sulphurous type smell. By this time he was quite frightened and (probably) ran the 3/4 to 1 mile back to his car parked on a back country dirt road. He drove to the Wagner farm home and described what had happened. Wagner followed the instructions Hammerman had given him and trudged off early Saturday evening into the brush in a search for, the source of Ham- merman 1 s fears. After three hours he finally found a sphere neatly buried in the ground with only a small circle showing to view. About 100 .feet before arriving at the site, Wagner detected the strong odor described as sul- fur-like, but yet clearly NOT sulphur. He has never sine lied anything .like it : and was aided in finding the sphere by following .the smell. The top of the sphere was clearly shiny, yet bluish- gray in color. He plucked it from the ground and carried it home. (Around 8:30 Saturday night). .  - ANALYSIS , - • . 7  • ' Wagner and his wife, \"Goldie,.\" had both heard a few sonic booms sometime .that morning, and sev- eral sonic booms, up to a possible four in number were heard by many witnesses within a few miles, of Lowell. Jerry.Schwendeman, Clifford McNabb, Clyde Jackson, Frankie McCreery, and Judy Hoover reported hearing the booms. Hammerman has correctly described how the ob- ject should have sounded. Since it was .moving toward him at a. supersonic speed, it would have landed before the boom. After landing the shock wave would reach his ears (nearly instantly), then the sound of impact of sphere against ground, followed by the whistling noise. The probable impact time was between 10:20 and 10:30 a.m. This is consistent with the state- ments of the sonic boom reporters. The impact site is moist \"white clay\" covered by a thick layer of the type of moss collected for Christmas tree decorations. No crater was made; the sphere left a clean, hard impression in the clay where it obviously struck at a great speed. The bottom of the hole was 15 inches from the undisturbed ground level. Since the sphere is about 11% inches in di- ameter there was presumably a 4% inch depression to the top of the sphere. Pieces of bluish-gray ablated metal from the object were cleanly im- bedded into the side of the, hole, and a gray streaking stain could be seen radiating inward toward the bottom of. the hole from around the sides. A thin layer of clay was heated to a very . high temperature and baked onto the bottom of the sphere. Keith reported much steam rising from the site, which is to be expected considering the high moisture content of the clay. The hole is slightly inclined from the verti- cal; a trajectory of about 10 degrees from the vertical is indicated with the angle inclined to- ward a bearing of 310 degrees (northwest). There was a clear area among the young saplings through which the sphere could have passed except for one dead branch. On this, branch at the ex- pected location a twig was freshly broken (unno- ticed by Wagner until brought to his attention). The sphere weighs about 20 pounds, is 11% in- ches .in diameter, and has a thick seam around the center that could be a, weld. It has., two \"latch\" type protrusions along the side opposite to one another and has two other highly melted cylind- rical protrusions along the ends at 90 degrees to the seam. One of these protrusions is not quite sealed. A % inch hole extends, into the hollow interior.  . . \\ The sphere rings with a clear sound .when ; struck and exhibits no radioactivity. The sur 1 face of the sphere is ablated (Shows evidence of having melted and . streamed over the surface. Some bubbles formed). The bluish-gray color is typical of steel that has undergone a heat treat-' ment similar to atmospheric entry. The shiny upper side was still shiny Sunday evening (around 5 p.m.) when first seen by Helen White of the Parkersburg Sentinel. She could ; still.barely make out the strange odor coming from the interior of the sphere. By Tuesday evening the shininess was completely gone as also was the odor. - CONCLUSIONS     i i This is no hoax! Ollie Wagner is straight,; sincere, and puzzled by the sphere. He wants an explanation and also hopes there may possibly be some financial reward of unknown origin (This last idea was planted by friends and relatives and Helen White of the Sentinel). At this point we can only speculate as to th^. origin of the sphere. Ideas range from some kincl 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Two from Argentina claim separate night sightings Location: Rada Tilly, Argentina Newspaper: La Nueva Provincia, March 16, 1974 Translated by: Bill Armstrong Submitted by: Joe Brill Comondoro Rivadavia, Chubut, March 15th, (Telam) (Translators note—Comondoro Rivadavia is a seaport town on the Atlantic coast at the ex- treme southeast corner of the state of Chubut Province which is quite a bit south of Bahia Blanca and even farther south of Buenos Aires.) The number of skeptics in relation to the ex- istance of \"flying saucers\" this week has de- creased by two persons: a business employee and a radio announcer who claim to have seen the ap- pearance of a UFO in the neighboring seashore village of Rado Tilly, to the south of this city. The employee is Antonio Contreras, who works in a local business establishment. The announcer identified only by his initials V.N.--is a member of the staff of L U 4 Radio Patagonia Argentina. Contreras says that at midnight of last Sunday (March 10) he was in Rada Tilly when he saw \"an object whose light rose up over the sea in the path like a corkscrew and returned then toward the water.\" The object, as Contreras explained, maneuvered through space for ten seconds and then disappeared \"with a surprising impulse in a southwesterly direction.\" For his part, the announcer related that in the early morning of Saturday (March 9th) while he was coming from Rada Tilly toward this city (Co- modoro Rivadavia), a strong light blinded him so that he had to brake his car to a halt on the shoulder of the road he was traveling.

U.S. space debris is unlikely to be so heavy. Steel is not an appropriate material to use in a weight conscious device. I have no Idea as to the typical construction characteris- :ics of foreign satellites; possibly China or Italy has shot up a simple, crude device for political purposes. Possibly this device was in- tended to hold some valuable fluid under pressure such as liquid helium or a gas. The agency which keeps track of all satellites and parts should be contacted for the identity of aiy object due for reentry.

If we make the assumption that we are de- liberately being misled, then the only \"counter- strategy\" would be to discard what our senses and our science can tell us about UFOs and start sub- stituting pure imagination. I prefer to leave that approach to John Keel. We have plenty of agent provocateurs who would like to have us be- lieve that they have a superior pipeline to truth. Jim McDonald had a term for them: \"noise generators.\" When it comes to the motives of UFO beings, I agree that most anything is possible and further discussions of this type may have some value in challenging our preconceptions. But let's keep them in perspective. UFO beings may not be deceiving us; we may be deceiving our- selves. The Morehead Planetarium \"saucers in a labor- atory\" story is undated, so I don't know \"whether it is a repeat of the same story released 7 or 8 years ago or a klassic re-issuance of a pseudo- theory in which additional experimentation is deemed unnecessary. I will make the same criti- cism of it now that I did then: where in the earth's atmosphere are the glass tubes that would allow the containment necessary for these \"UFOs\" to be created, presumably by lightning? And if we do have atmospheric glass tubes, are they ter- restrial or extraterrestrial in origin? ! Where are the near-vacuums in the atmosphere close enough to the ground that these glowing gasses can be seen and reported as UFOs? What about non-March and non-September and non- thunderstorm UFOs? If in fact these \"apparitions\" appear in\" areas of momentary low pressure...just prior to being occupied by air from an adjoining high pressure area,\" they must of necessity be as insignificant and transient as swamp gas. Or is it \"plasmoids?\" j From deceitful spacemen to atmospheric appar- itions, we are witnessing human reactions to UFO reports representing attempts to fit them into our scheme of things. Over the years the same polarization between omnipotent spacemen (save the phenomenon) theories and natural anomaly theories has been present. On one end of the spectrum we have suffered through Adamski's golden-haired saviors, cosmic game-players, and demonic kidnapers of humans; on the other, Klassic \"plasmoids,\" Donald Robey's ice \"meteor- oids,\" and Norton Novitt's electrified bugs. | Let's not become too enamored of our theories until we have accomplished a great deal more data gathering and careful investigation, and until there is a real scientific investigation of UFOs. Dabbling prematurely in meta-UFOlogy is a danger- ous practice. UFO's in lab COMMENT ON \"UFO'S CREATED IN THE LABORATORY\" By Theodore Spickler Associate Professor of Physics: West Liberty State College The \"UFO's\" generated by A. F. Jenzano in the laboratory cannot be even remotely compared with any hypothetical atmospheric plasmas that may exist under natural conditions. I have created these \"hovering fleets\" myself, as have countless students of physics throughout the country in their normal laboratory work. A vacuum about one thousand times greater than the lowest of atmospheric low pressures must be produced within a sealed tube. Tens of thousands of volts are then applied to this device for breakdown to occur with a resulting plasma light show. Mother Nature must go to the extremes of thunderstorm production to be able to generate the necessary voltage gradients: we should not be surprised at plasma demonstrations during natural storms, only dismay that theory has not yet caught up with these ball lightning displays. Surprise is properly aroused when strange plasma type shapes flit around in the atmosphere under relatively .calm weather conditions. At such times the natural electricity in the air CANNOT combine with so called pockets of low pressure to produce natural plasmas with which to fool errant MUFON watchers. There is no theory that can cur- rently explain such observations:. I am unwilling to rule out a plasma explanation for some (indeed only a few) UFO sightings; we must bear in mind that even the scientifically accepted ball lightning reports are not yet ex- plained, which suggests possibly a natural mech- anism of unknown origin at work. I am willing to rule out so-called explanations that have holes in them of such a vast extent that Evel Knievel himself would surely fail to close the gap. Jenzano has created a fiction of this latter type. The Corona discharges sometimes observed a- round high voltage lines do bear a resemblance to the Jenzano laboratory glows; the mechanism of production is similar. However theory does not suggest that these power line discharges can form into large blobs of light many tens of feet in diameter moving away on missions of generating UFO reports. 20"}]
