These intrusions were discussed secretly at the highest levels of the Belgian government, in consultation with a handful of UFO researchers. As a key NATO ally in a geographically strategic buffer location, Belgium was furnished with the latest equipment to repel a Soviet attack. This included the \"hottest\" jet fighter, the F-16, as well as top-of-the-line radar for ground control of interception missions. The puzzle presented to the Belgian authorities par- allels that faced by American officials since 1947 â€” what was the source of the eyewitness and radar re- ports? Every effort was made to determine if the UFOs might be some highly advanced aircraft, such as the Stealth or Aurora. The answer was \"no.\" And if they were not \"ours\" then they must be \"theirs.\" First choice for \"theirs\" being Soviet, but Soviet vehicles with amaz- ing flight characteristics, flying over NATO territory with insolent impunity, night after night. Exasperated, and genuinely worried about the pro- found security implications of allowing Soviet (or even extraterrestrial) aircraft to roam unchallenged over their country, the authorities made a terribly difficult decision. At the next clear opportunity, armed fighters would in- tercept the UFO. On the evening of March 29, 1990 thousands of ob- servers reported anomalous flying objects. Military radars were tracking the same targets. At a few minutes before midnight a flight of two F-16s rose from a NATO airfield with orders to intercept the UFO. Only the mysterious nature of the target made this mission different from the hundreds of intercepts ac- complished as war training exercises by the pilots of the F-16s. Usually the \"enemy\" was another NATO fighter, merely part of the exercise, known to be friendly. Occasionally they were sent to identify a civilian or military craft that had strayed off course and out of radio communications. But the equipment and techniques are the same. Two jets is the rule, dictated by the requirements of modern air combat tactics. One pilot is the \"leader,\" the other is his \"wingman.\" The combination provides enhanced offensive capability and improves defense when under attack. The story of the great Belgian UFO event has been detailed elsewhere. In an action without precedent, the Belgian government freely opened the files on the case to the public. The Air Force officer in charge of the operation and the Minister of Defense gave a press con- NV 90 is the call sign of this flight. Five by five is another way of saying \"loud and clear.\" The radar controller has the UFO on the screen and gives the pilots the bear- ing and distance of their quarry. The chase has begun. ference and answered all questions honestly. None of the traditional \"swamp gas\" and \"weather balloon\" non- sense. During the intervening five years nothing has emerged to cast doubt on the veracity of the Belgian government's statements, or to elicit a prosaic explana- tion of the UFO sightings. Among the great mass of data released to the public is the transcript of radio conversations between the radar controller and the fighter pilots sent to intercept the UFO. What follows is a translation from the original French, together with commentary to ensure that this ex- traordinarily dramatic chase is comprehensive to the layman. (I am indebted to my wife for the translation, and to my friend Col. B of the U. S. Air Force, who reviewed the transcript and lent much insight based on his expe- rience as a fighter pilot and expert on the F-16. The translation required several steps, from French to English, then from the highly technical and idiosyn- cratic jargon of the pilots into ordinary language.) The transcript begins at seven minutes past midnight, rendered in the transcript as 07M. Both jets are air- borne. The wingman is three to five miles behind the leader, using his onboard radar and distance measuring equipment to maintain his position. At night and in clouds, visual contact with the other airplane is impos- sible, so standard practice is to make the leader a \"tar- get\" on the wingman's radar. Attempting to fly a tight formation would invite a disastrous mid-air collision. The controller gives the direction of the target from the jets in degrees, followed by the distance to the target. Usually this direction is relative to the nose of the air- plane, so that 030 would mean clockwise 30 degrees from the nose, and 310 would be between the nose and the left wing. At other times the controller will give the interceptors a heading to fly, based on the same 360 degree plan, with 360 being magnetic North. The leader repeats the instructions to insure that he understood them correctly. The transcript begins as the jets have left the airfield tower frequency and are checking in with the radar in- tercept controller. Controller = C, pilot = P.

This allows the pilot to focus visually on his target, while at the same time being able to note the basic parameters needed to fly the airplane, such as airspeed and atti- tude, without moving his head or taking his eyes off the target. The camera can be switched to see what the pilot sees through the windshield, or to record what the radar scope sees. The Belgian government released all of the radar scope camera footage for public viewing. Short fragments of this material have been shown on television programs dealing with the Belgian incident. Usually interceptors switch to the HUD display when they are close to the target and attacking. The pilot is expecting a successful run any moment, and opts to keep the HUD mode for the camera.)

P: Negative C: Return to the South T he pursuit continued for another six minutes. Low on fuel, and completely frustrated by a target that outsped and outmaneuvered them, the physically ex- hausted and emotionally drained F-16 pilots returned to their home base. Colonel B is skeptical about UFOs, and believes that the most likely explanation for this incident is Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) devices, probably on board another NATO aircraft in the vicinity. In other words, the radar target being tracked by the ground controller and by the fighters was phony, an artifact of sophisticated electronic gadgetry designed to fool radar. Such de- vices were used with great success during the Gulf War. On the other hand, he is puzzled by some central as- pects of the chase. \"I've been on several intercepts against jamming targets (ECM),\" the Colonel told me. \"The ground controller in Belgium was able to maintain contact with civilian aircraft in the vicinity, and that is not possible with the ECM jamming I have encoun- tered. So that's very strange.\" Moreover, it is beyond his experience with ECM to have jamming that simultane- ously gives the same false target to both the ground radars and the airborne radars. The Colonel is most persuaded to believe that this was ECM by the fact that there was no sonic boom pro- duced as the UFO exceeded the speed of sound. This has exercised all of the technical analysts, including those who have examined â€” and dismissed â€” the ECM the- ory. This UFO also generated thousands of eyewitness re- ports from observers on the ground. How likely is it that an ECM test, or repeated over- flights of a super-secret American airplane, would be carried out over a densely populated foreign country? The fighters were armed, and could have collided with each other or with a civilian airliner during the chase, DECEMBER 1995 NUMBER 33Z PACE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL causing tremendous loss of life. Assuming that risk for the sake of a test of Belgium's air defense posture is pre- posterous. Nor is it reasonable to test any device of such potential military importance over foreign territory, where a chance error or mechanical failure could liter- ally drop it into the hands of the enemy. And one would suppose that the \"test\" would be revealed in due time to the Belgian government, but nothing of the sort has oc- curred. But regardless of the nature of the target, Colonel B. a veteran of many intercept missions, some successful and some not, says the transcript has the ring of perfect authenticity. \"I can sympathize with those guys. They were having a very bad day up there.\" NOTES The 1990 wave of sightings in Belgium continues to at- tract attention in Europe, where the European Parliament is considering establishing a central UFO research bu- reau at least partly because of the notoriety of this un- resolved case. The London Sunday Express for September 17, 1995 quoted a letter sent to British re- searcher Derek Sheffield by former Belgian Minister of Defense Leo Delcroix to the effect that ''Despite the most rigorous official investigation, no earthly expla- nation has been found,\" that there was at least one earlier attempt by Belgian F-16s to intercept a similar UFO, and that he had ruled out the possibility that the UFO reports were caused by an AWACS or Stealth aircraft. And Dr. David Clark, spokesman for the Labour Party, in a com- plaint reminiscent of Congressman Steven Schiff's prob- lems with U.S. Defense Department stonewalling, said about the British Ministry of Defense, \"They have offi- cial recorded information and our view is the MoD is be- ing far too secretive. They ought to be much more open on this issue. If it wasn't a UFO and was a Stealth bomber then we should be told.\" In August 1995 Mrs. Marie Galbraith of the BSW Foundation met with General De Brouwer in Brussels, where he assured her that this case still remains un- solved and of the greatest interest to the Belgian gov- ernment. In a telephone conversation in October 1995, ufologist Antonio Huneeus received the same informa- tion from the General, in addition to the news that he will retire from his position as head of the Belgian Air Force and will return to civilian life in early 1996. SOBEPS, the Belgian civilian UFO research organi- zation, published a book detailing their exhaustive in- vestigation of the 1989-1990 sighting wave, and re- cently produced an updated version. Unfortunately, the book is not available in English but it is of exceptional value as an example of what can be accomplished by . dedicated ufologists determined to place on record all the facts in this very rich and provocative case. In a highly technical chapter dealing with the radar data, physics professor Auguste Meessen concludes that some of the ground radar images of the UFO were almost certainly caused by unusual atmospheric conditions, but then finds that the airborne radar images could not be explained in that way. The book is 504 pages long, and contains over 200 illustrations, many in color. Write to SOBEPS, Avenue Paul Janson 74, B-1070, Brussels, Belgium for ordering information. An account of the Belgian sightings with emphasis on the radar \"chase\" was published in the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 268, August 1990. The Belgian case joins other classics like Bentwaters and Tehran in which UFOs invaded heavily guarded airspace and frolicked at will, neutralizing the most ad- vanced operational military defenses. UFO DATA - Continued from Page 12 sure of reliability (that the event did occur as described). Index data for Reliability are distributed over a wide range of values, from 0.25 to 1.0, and the distributions are nearly the same for CEs and non-CEs. The overall average, 0.55, is also the average for both CEs and non- CEs separately. Combining this with the fact that only 33 percent of the cases have values below 0.5, the theoret-. ical average, we surmise with cautious conservatism that testimonies of witnesses, overall, do describe events as they were experienced. Using Values for Selection A selection of cases having high credibility, based on their Certainty Index values, may be beneficial in the fu- ture. For today, only about 60 percent of the reports have been evaluated. If a selection rule was established to get only the best reports for statistical analysis, too many reports would not even be considered â€” a situa- tion that will change once the database has grown sig- nificantly. For this report, no selection process will use the Certainty Index values.

David Spencer, Deputy Director, Investigations T his begins a series of eight planned reports in- volving the statistics of the data in the computer UFO Database. Over 500 Field Investigators have individually devoted many hours to UFO reporting and have contributed valuable information to MUFON. The information currently in the database (used for these reports) is from about 350 Field Investigators working in teams or individually. To avoid any confusion, the credit for this data and all of its findings belongs to the Field Investigators. This report puts the information together to extract value from the Field Investigators' efforts. Although the inferences and deductions drawn from the data do not necessarily reflect the future, there are now enough data over enough time to examine the pos- sibility of trends, providing limited capability to make projections. The data analyses given in these articles are not highly sophisticated but are enough to build some hypotheses. In part, an effort is made to provide a basis of support for what ufologists rationalize today â€” at the risk of being boring and tedious. If nothing else, these \"So what?\" conclusions help establish the reasonable- ness of the data. In turn, the reasonableness helps certify the findings that may suggest changes to traditional ufological paradigms. There is far too much information to present in one or two articles. The current plan is to provide eight sections on the major aspects. (See Outline.)

This report examines data existing in the computer database as of mid-October 1995, and it includes reports of events as early as the late 1940's. Since the reports submitted before 1987 are not yet reviewed for database entry, nearly all of the reports of events before 1987 were written between 1987 and 1995. There are still re- ports submitted in 1987 and 1988 that require more study before they are entered, and there are several re- cent reports placed on hold, awaiting more informa- tion. For these and other reasons, the number of events recorded for any year should increase over time. The inclusiveness of the database is restricted to cases that are consciously remembered without the aid of hypnosis or other known psychological influences on OUTLINE Section 1 UFO report quantities and qualifica- tions, types of sightings, and the Ballester-Guasp Certainty Index. Section 2 Times of sightings (Year, Month, Day, Hour). Section 3 Locations (geometric coordinates) of sightings within the contiguous USA. Section 4 Observed objects, single and multiple object sightings, reported sizes, col- ors, emissions, sounds, altitude, dis- tance, and landings. Section 5 Effects observed during and from sight- ings, additional evidence obtained, sighting correlations, multiple events on the same day, and multiple events on sequential days. Section 6 Witnesses, including quantities, gen- ders, ages, occupations, what they were doing, and how they responded. Section 7 Unusual psychological or physiological effects, multiple sightings by single witnesses, and observed entities. Section 8 Summary of information related to in- vestigation and reporting methods and how MUFON became informed. memory (such as drugs), although event details re- membered through interviewing techniques intended to help the witness' recall are acceptable if the witness is not obviously led by the interviewer. In addition, the database does not include reports that have strong evidence of being IFOs or hoaxes. A separate file is kept for the probable IFO/hoax cases, for potential corroboration purposes. A corroborating report could change the status of a report in this file and could lead to its being readdressed as an addition to the data- base. There are presently 603 event reports recorded in the database, 590 of which are claimed sightings of UFOs. To have a clear delineation of data, most results shown in this report are from the 598 reports of events occurring before 1995. For several studies, the data was restricted to events occurring in the 48 adjoining United States, since the handful of reports from outside the 48 states could cause an improper bias on the statistics.

Quantities From the data of Table 1 -2. there are 267 CE types, of which 84 percent are of the CE-1 classification (no last- ing effects and no entities seen). Physical effects (CE-2) were observed in 20 cases; entities (CE-3 and CE-4) were observed in 21 cases, and two cases documented that the witness experienced lasting physiological ef- fects, such as an injury (CE-5). Physiological effects were experienced in relation to two distant sightings, one MA-5 and one FB-5. Entities were seen in four distant sightings, but only one inci- dence of observed distant entities has been reported to occur since 1984. Table 1-2. Quantities by Type and Classification.

The average for the MA types has jumped from 29 percent before 1989 to 35 percent for 1990-1994. Data regarding events before 1987 are the result of witness recollections over a significant time span. Coupling this with the fact that \"old\" recollections of close encounters are more likely to be reported than are recollections of distant encounters, the apparently larger percentage of close encounters in the first period (< 1985) is understandable. This decreasing proportion of CEs taken together with an increasing proportion of MAs during the last two periods suggests that more people now are watching the skies than before, a point that will be more strongly supported in the discussion of object shapes (Report Section 4). The statistics associated with the AN, FB, and MA types are often combined and called distant sightings, to make direct statistical comparisons with close encounters. BALLESTER-GUASP CERTAINTY INDEX Description A method for evaluating reports to obtain a measure of relative \"goodness\" was introduced to the database mea- sures by Jerold R. Johnson in 1992. This method, de- veloped by Vincente-Juan Ballester Olmos and Miguel Guasp, provides an objective way to assess the strange- ness and witness reliability associated with a sighting and the quality of its investigation. A complete discus- sion is in the fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual ( 1995). The possible values range from zero (no credit) to 1.0. Distributions Chart 1-2, illustrates the distributions of index values for close encounters and distant sightings from 375 of 378 Certainty Indexed reports before 1995. The three close encounter indexes that are not in the chart have values of 0.41, 0.47, and 0.70. Although not shown, these values are included in the statistics. Overall, the average Certainty Index before 1995 is 0.134, based on the in- dexed reports. Since the Certainty Index is a multiple of the Quality, Strangeness, and Reliability indexes, the the- oretical average (using the average for each compo- nent) is 0.5 X 0.5 X 0.5 = 0.125, meaning that the aver- age for the database is about 7 percent higher than the theoretical average. Compared to the distant sightings, the close encoun- ters have a much wider range of index values that can be approximated as forming a normal distribution. The av- erage (median) and mode values of the close encounter indexes is 0.18 and the sample standard deviation is 0.084. Being well distributed, the values indicate they do distinguish reports according to their relative merits, but whether the differences of values are deserved has yet to be determined. The distant sighting indexes appear to form a Poisson distribution, and they have a much lower average value (0.10) and mode (0.08) than close encounter indexes. These lower values are partly due to the Certainty Index component for strangeness (appropriately) giving close encounters more weight. By separating the distant sightings according to type (AN, FB, and MA), the MA sighting reports are found to have a wider range of index values than the FB sighting reports. Similarly, reports of FB sightings have a wider range of values than AN sightings. The FB distribu- tion (69 samples of indexes) is strongly Poisson-like, while the MA indexes (120 samples) resemble a skewed (left side) normal distribution. The AN distribution of in- dexes is poorly defined, probably due to the small sam- ple size (21). The Certainty Index has three components. One com- ponent, Strangeness, relates to how unusual the sighting is; another component. Reliability, is associated with witness credibility for the sighting, and the third com- ponent, Quality, addresses the interviewing and investi- gation by the Field Investigator. Strangeness and Reliability are discussed in this section, but Quality is discussed in Section 8. Strangeness The Strangeness component weights the Certainty Index based on how unusual the sighting appeared, such as whether it seemed to defy physical possibilities, had entities, and left evidence. The overall average for the database is 0.3 â€” less than the theoretical average of 0.5. Only 5 percent of the events had values over 0.5. As suggested earlier, the CEs have a higher average (0.39) than the non-CEs (0.23). At this time, the only conclusion drawn from the data is that, apparently, most reported events are not exceptionally unusual. Almost 29 percent of the cases (48 percent of the distant sightings) claimed only one of the seven possible identifiers, which was nearly always \"anomalous appearance.\" Reliability The count of witnesses, their occupations, activity, age, and other identifiers are combined to get a relative mea- PAGE12 NUMBER 332 Continued on Page 8 DECEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ARGENTINA AIRLINES UFO SIGHTING by Walter H. Andrus, Jr. O n July 31, 1995, Aerolineas Argentinas flight 734 departed from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and was scheduled to land at San Carlos de Bariloche, Rio Negro Province, Argentina, about 870 miles southwest of Buenos Aires, at 8:10 p.m. The flight had been normal with the exception of the infre- quent slice of pizza served on board, together with a lemon mousse. The flight routine had been altered by the efforts a crew member had to make to put a young pas- senger, who had both legs in a cast, in a reclining seat in the sixth row. However, at 8:10 p.m., the estimated landing time, a sudden maneuver was clearly felt by the 102 passengers aboard as reported by Mariano De Vedia, a reporter from the newspaper La Nacion, who was one of the passengers flying to the ski resort city. After the sudden maneuver to gain altitude, many passengers were con- cerned by the delay in landing, which the pilot had promised would be in 20 minutes. Quite a few passen- gers were scared and started to pray. At 8:25 p.m., when the passengers would normally be expected to pick up their luggage, the aircraft was still climbing. The captain of the flight was heard on the public address system, explaining that a blackout that had affected the electrical power at the airport was the reason why they had to keep circling until the lights could be restored and a landing authorized. This an- nouncement prompted all of the passengers to instinc- tively look out the windows, where they were sur- rounded by total darkness. The announcement of the blackout also halted the cabin attendants' visits and service to their passengers. With their safety belts buckled up, some passengers, among whom were members of the National Commission of Atomic Energy and the Balseiro Institute, recalled last week's flight, when wind, and a snow storm made another Aerolineas Argentinas flight turn back to Buenos Aires without landing at Bariloche. Captain Polanco, in his second communication to the passengers, promised an imminent landing as soon as the electricity had been restored, but that took longer than anticipated. Landing at 9:10 p.m., one hour later than their scheduled ETA. the passengers were in such a hurry to get to their destinations that they lost interest in really learning the reasons for the delay. The data included by Captain Polanco in his report was confirmed by Air Force Major Jorge Luis Oviedo, the airport chief, in his statements to the press. He con- firmed that the pilot could not land in his first attempt due to the sudden appearance of a strange object in his path, just when the airport was blacked out. Oviedo said that the mass of light was observed by personnel in the control tower. He felt that the passengers in the air- liner may not have noticed the mass of light because the cabin lights were lit up. However, it was very apparent from the pilots' cockpit, where the lights were dimmed. Major Oviedo stated that the aircraft was at 5,500 feet al- titude, with the object beside it. All of the airport's radio support was cut off, and there was a blackout of the whole city. PILOT REPORT An interview with pilot Jorge Polanco by Carolina Arenes revealed the following quotes: \"We cannot go on believing that we are alone in all the immensity of the universe.\" \"What we saw was not a plane, it was nothing DECEMBER 1995 NUMBER 332 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL San Carlos de Bariloche Aeroport de Bariloche 1.

UNEXPLAINABLE BLACKOUT After a total blackout lasting ten minntes, the control tower authorized the descent and landing of flight 734. The four crew members of the Boeing 727 were Jorge Polanco, pilot; Carlos Dortona, co-pilot; Jorge Allende, flight engineer, and another pilot from the same com- pany; all noticed the appearance of the object. \"At first we worried because it was coming at us at full speed, but it stopped some 100 meters from us. When we called the control tower to learn if there was another plane in the area, they confirmed that the only other one was from the Gendarmerie, which was flying 600 meters above us,\" said Polanco. It was Ruben Cipazuk, pilot of the Gendarmerie's turboprop PA 315/GN who filled them in about the whereabouts of the UFO: \"I'm seeing it and I don't know what it is, but it follows you,\" he stated. When the airliner began its approach to land, the object placed itself some 100 meters to the right of the plane and accompanied its descent. In the tower, the instruments \"went crazy\" and, un- explainably, the night once again swallowed the lights of Bariloche and the landing strip disappeared in the dark- ness. \"I then made a so-called escape maneuver and went back up to 3,000 meters, but the UFO,\" said PAGE 14 NUMBER 332 DECEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Polanco, \"with aerial motions that are impossible for our planes, and at a speed that is unknown by human tech- nology, remained hovering at 3,000 meters.\" When the Aerolineas plane began its second descent, the strange craft disappeared at high speed behind Mount Otto. Jorge Allende. the flight engineer, said that \"in my 15 years experience I never saw anything like it. I never be- lieved we were the only beings in the universe, but all the same I'm very excited. Nobody is ready to see such a dazzling confirmation.\" Credit for this report is made to Mrs. Ruth Gerstel, Buenos Aires, Argentina, via Mrs. Jane Thomas Guma (translator), Glendale, Arizona.

Investigator: Mary Zimnier The first of three 1995 sighting events began for Jack (pseudonym) on January 16 while he was assisting a customer at his book store in a local shopping center of a major city in Florida. A flash of silver above the facing buildings caught his eye. An oval, metallic object, edge down, was close to Jack and getting closer. It was dark in the middle and had a small red light at one end. Noiselessly, the object was turning over and over (\"pirouetting,\" according to the customer witness), as if rolling across the sky. Jack and the customer rushed to get a better look, but as soon as they were outside, the object sped away \"four times faster than a jet\" and went out of view be- hind the buildings. LOG #950402E, MA-1, 01/28/95. Investigator: Mary Zimnier At 1430 hours on January 28, Jack was working with two customers at the counter of his book store when he had his second 1995 experience. Glancing out the win- dow, he saw what appeared to be the bottom of a dark- disk in the sky. Jack stopped what he was doing to watch the object, estimated ten feet in diameter, which spun and moved northward until out of view. About an hour later. Jack saw other objects farther away headed in the same direction, but these objects were wobbling, sometimes appearing light â€” reflecting light â€” and sometimes appearing dark. Within another 30 minutes and intermittently until about 1800 hours, Jack saw several similar objects ap- pear and disappear, and all but the last one seemed to be \"about one-fourth the size of the full moon.\" According to Jack, the final object passed by at a low altitude, was shaped like a boomerang, and had \"a thin object [protruding from] the back.\" As he watched, the ob- ject's shape appeared to change to a deltoid (triangle). Jack believes this event caused the other witnesses to leave his store. Not to let the series of events pass without some ver- ification, Jack took several pictures, but the resulting processed film was a full roll of double exposures: LOG # 950401E, MA-1, 01/28/95. Investigator: Mary Zimnier Jack's UFO-related experiences that day (see Log #950402E) were not over when he left his book store at about 2000 hours that evening for his home in a small town north of the city. At his normal exit from the free- way, Jack saw a stationary light above and in front of him. A beam of what appeared to be a tube of orange and yellow light aimed at a steep downward angle was being emitted by the light. The beam disappeared, then reappeared, and the object moved off slowly until it was out of sight. LOG #950905bC, CE-1, 06/19/95. Investigators: Beverly Trout and Ken Mott Visiting a friend at his home in a rural area of Iowa at 2200 hours on June 19, Bill (pseudonym) and his friend saw a light which appeared to be moving back and forth over a clearing about 2.5 miles away. They decided to drive to the area and see what was happening. When the two arrived near the area, they stopped on the shoulder of the road and looked toward a timbered area where four, chartreuse green glows seemed to be emanating up- ward from the ground. From their vantage point about 1,000 feet away, the two men estimated that each glow was about 20 feet in diameter, and the glows were sep- arated by about 100 feet. Without further investigation, the two left and drove to the opposite side of the timbered area. They saw two greenish lights and one intensely bright white light float- ing about 20 feet above the ground and not more than 150 feet from them. Bill saw a green beam angling downward toward a tree line and sweeping back and forth in an arc. The white light swung around from in front of them to their side, stopped, and appeared to focus on the car. Frightened, they chose to \"back up and get out of there!\" (emphasis added). Bill saw green lights behind the car as they turned away. DECEMBER 1995 NUMBER 332 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Back at the house, at about 0100 hours, the men saw a ball of light across the road, perhaps 500-600 feet away. They went to the road and watched until the light was gone a few minutes later, leaving when the two turned their heads away to look at something else. Although Bill was sure he and his friend stood on the road no more than 15 minutes, when they returned to the house over an hour had passed. It was then 0230 hours. Outside during the early morning hours. Bill saw similar lights in the distance NW and SW of him. One light to the NW was green and larger than the others. Bill explained it was the size of a barrel they had been burning in the barnyard. Bill began talking to the light, making statements such as, \"Please don't scare me too much,\" then \"Can you flash once for 'yes' and twice for 'no'?\" He was sure a light to the WSW of him responded by flashing once. Another question resulted in another flash. Finally, he asked, \"Can't you leave me a sign or some kind of evidence?\" Bill claims the light \"zipped\" up to him then backed off and performed a bouncing motion about 1/4 mile away. The coming of daylight ended Bill's light show. LOG #950905aC, MA-1, 07/26/95. Investigator: Beverly Trout The witness, Charlotte (pseudonym), has a history of psychic experiences. At 2200 hours on the night of July 26, Charlotte left work with a strong feeling she should go to a nearby lake and wait for some type of commu- nication. She obeyed the urging and waited there for sev- eral minutes. Just as she started to leave, a large but dim starlike moving object caught her eye. The distant light passed directly overhead in what appeared to her to be a zig-zag, sometimes straight, flight of about 10 seconds. The light then shut off (\"blinked out\") for several sec- onds. \"You're gone? That's it?\" Charlotte asked in disgust. Suddenly, where the light had disappeared, there was a large flaring of soft white light topped with a red cres- cent in an oval shape. The shape seemed to have a dis- tinct boundary. Within about two seconds, the apparition was gone, and Charlotte was left with the impression that she should report what she had seen. 1995 UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS The MUFON 1995 International UFO Symposium Proceedings are now available by mail from MUFON in Seguin, Texas.

REBOUND It has come to my attention that it is well known within the medical community that certain drugs, even over- the-counter ones (like Benadryl) which state on the label, \"May cause drowsiness,\" are those which typically af- fect the brain's neurotransmitters. These drugs suppress R.E.M. (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, setting the stage for \"R.E.M. rebound\" to occur. The body, when deprived of normal R.E.M. sleep (i.e., an overworked, busy college student), may at a later time (when the student is in a relaxed state) begin to spontaneously flash into an R.E.M. state, even to dream while awake. This can be very scary, but is not dangerous and is entirely normal. A tip-off to when R.E.M. rebound is occurring is that the room about one is observed to be jerking or shaking back and forth somewhat while one. is awake. One may simultaneously experience voices, or other dream activity, in addition to the \"jerking.\" An alcoholic who stops drinking can experience R. E. M. rebound while awake due to no longer having his/her normal R.E.M. activity suppressed by the al- PAGE 16 NUMBER 332 DECEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL cohol (D.T.'s) Also, people who take Prozac (then ei- ther reduce or discontinue the drug) can experience such vivid dreams while awake that they are con- vinced that the dreams are reality. They should be warned that this can occur. Schizo-typal personalities usually have weak egos, which allow their subconscious imagery to come for- ward into the waking state. No medication is required for this to occur, but it should be considered when people re- port anomalous occurrences. All of the above must be considered when investi- gating UFO sightings, or when considering one's own or others' anomalous experiences. â€” Anastasia Wietrzychowska MUFON State Director Connecticut ROSWELL INITIATIVE UPDATE Kent Jeffrey, Coordinator T he International Roswell Initiative (IRI) continues to gain momentum, both internationally and in the United States. Roswell Declarations are now being col- lected by organizations in ten countries, with the number continuing to increase. Over 20,000 signed Declarations have been collected so far. In addition to hundreds of sci- entists and engineers, the signatories include two re- tired Air Force generals and two former U.S. astro- nauts, one of whom walked on the moon. The ultimate goal of the IRI remains an Executive or- der for a blanket declassification of any government held information on Roswell, UFOs in general, or ex- traterrestrial intelligence.. Indications are that the vast majority of U.S. citizens favor such an open policy and that many would support a political effort to achieve it. The growth potential for the IRI is tremendous. Efforts will be stepped up after the first of the year. Originally the plan of the IRI was simply to collect a large number of signed Roswell Declarations and then, in a one-time effort, deliver them to members of the U.S. Congress and the President, hoping in the process to generate enough political and media support to eventu- ally bring about the desired Executive order. Due in part to an overwhelmingly positive response, it has been decided to keep the International Roswell Initiative an ongoing effort. A strategy of continual pressure (\"ham- mering away\") generally has a far greater chance of success in the long term than does a \"one shot'' ap- proach. The revised strategy of the IRI is to continue to col- lect and keep on file as many signed copies of the Roswell Declaration as possible, enter the information from these Declarations into a confidential database, and then periodically deliver computerized printouts of all signatories to the Declaration (categorized both by stale and Congressional district) to members of Congress and the President. The plan is for the first formal deliv- ery of lists of signatories to Congress and the White House to take place in 1996. Simultaneously, organiza- tions in other countries will deliver lists of Roswell Declaration signatories in their countries to their re- spective American embassies. VOLUNTEER AND MEDIA SUPPORT The IRI has been a true grassroots movement, as all work has been done by volunteers who have paid their own expenses. Many have helped by making copies of the Roswell Declaration and distributing them to others, sometimes in large numbers, at meetings and confer- ences. Others have volunteered to help, using their home computers, wnli the monumental task of recording the data from signed Roswell Declarations into the IRI database. Packets of 500 Declarations, along with the necessary software, are being sent to each volunteer. All in all, those involved are motivated solely by their desire to help in this quest for the truth. The effort has also been helped immeasurably by certain media organizations, most notably Omni maga- zine, when they published the Roswell Declaration in their October 1994 issue. More recently, Sightings aired a nice human interest story (produced by Rob Morhaim) about the efforts of high school students in Londonderry, New Hampshire, who collected over 800 signed Roswell Declarations. THE SANTILLI FILM Unfortunately, this unwelcome monstrosity remains with us. When a hoax overshadows the real event, cred- ibility suffers. The situation has been greatly exacerbated by the cheap hype and irresponsible, so-called journal- ism of the FOX network special, Alien Autopsy, Fact or Fiction, which aired on August 28. 1995. The FOX presentation gave the impression that a multitude of in- terdisciplinary experts felt that there was a real chance that the Santilli film was genuine. In reality, that is any- thing but the case. The FOX special was a classic ex- ample of a selective presentation of the facts and selec- tive editing. The Roswell production for British television, which aired on the same date, was far more objective and su- perior to the FOX presentation. However, even the British production could have spent more time on the ac- tual Roswell case and a lot less time on the obviously hoaxed Santilli footage. On September 16, 1995, the American program Sightings aired an excellent short (8 1/2 minutes) expose on the Santilli film. Also, TF1, a French television net- work, has been carrying out a diligent and thorough in- vestigation of the Santilli film for a number of months. Many of the findings of their excellent effort were pre- DECEMBER 1995 NUMBER 332 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL sented on a network show broadcast in France and hosted by Jacques Pradel on October 23, 1995. As inconsistencies, contradictions, and lies regarding the Santilli film continue to surface, it seems incom- prehensible that anyone who looks at the facts objec- tively could think that there is even a scintilla of a chance that this film is genuine. In my opinion, many of the statements made by so-called expert witnesses and researchers concerning the Santilli film are reprehensi- ble. I have been in frequent contact with the TF1 inves- tigative team in France and plan a comprehensive fol- low-up to my earlier bulletin on the Santilli film (IRI Bulletin #2 â€” also published as an article in the June 1995 MUFON UFO Journal). FUTURE ROSWELL RESEARCH Equally important to the political effort in resolving the Roswell matter is the research effort to find surviving witnesses to the 1947 event and to investigate all leads and other possible sources of information. There are still a number of possibilities to pursue. THE ROSWELL WORLD WIDE WEB PAGE The temporary address of the IRI web page is: http://users.aol.com/IUFOG. The IRI can also presently be contacted at the following email address: RoswellDec@aol.com. The IRI web page should be available on the Internet under its permanent domain name by the end of November. The domain address will be: http://www.roswell.org. Using the Roswell web page, it will be possible for people to electronically sign the Roswell Declaration us- ing their email address in lieu of a handwritten signature. This has the potential to increase the number of signa- tories substantially. All future IRI special reports will be available on the web page. There will be a special report on the Santilli film available in early December and a special report on the 1994 Air Force Report on the Roswell Incident sometime after the first of the year. Starting in January 1996 there will be regular Roswell updates posted on the IRI web page at the beginning of each month. CONNECTIONS by Beth Codings and Anna Jamerson Wild Flower Press, PO Box 726, Newberg, OR 97132, $17.95, available Dec. 1995 Reviewed by Andrea Pritchard For abduction investigators the double first-person common-sense accounts in Connections offer a wealth of information. 1 The authors do not slant the material to fit an overall interpretation. As Ceilings and Jamerson look into the events they recount, evidence accumu- lates. Sometimes the new information helps to explain life long puzzles; other times it only contributes to the mystery. Either way the material is clearly reported. Connections is also a book for experiencers. This case is investigated and reported by the experiencers themselves and deals with many of the concerns that trouble experiencers. \"Should I seek help and what kind do I need?\" Suggestions are offered throughout this book. Investigators, fellow experiencers, therapists, support groups â€” all are explored in the search for truth. \"Strange things happen to me but I don't feel that I'm an abductee\"â€” that's where Anna Jamerson is as this book begins. Her explorations, of course, are particular to her, but reflect a thorough determination to understand what is happening. \"Will it help to explore this?\" Beth originally thinks not, Anna feels compelled to find more information. As they keep their journals, explore events through hyp- nosis, puzzle certain questions and ask family and 'friends about them, the reader gets a feeling for what kinds of information can be found through such explo- ration, and what kinds can not. Connections is also a book for the general public. At present our society is not equipped to deal with the ex- traordinary happenings recounted by experiencers. Society wants evidence, but this is tricky to collect and evaluate. Yes, auto mechanics can attest that a car's electrical system is fried, but they can't confirm the disoriented perceptions of the driver or the bizarre story which later surfaces. Doctors can't find evidence of alien-induced rape and pregnancy but these certainly have caused considerable distress. Besides evidence, society also wants explanations. Beth Collings and Anna Jamerson don't claim to have the answers, but they tell their stories with great courage and clarity and they provide a wealth of material we can all use when looking for explanations of the great mys- tery of our times â€” alien abductions. May we all join Collings and Jamerson in seeking \"Connections.\" 1 Some readers may have been introduced to this case by CDB Bryan's book Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Alien Abductions, UFOs and the Conference at MIT and want to compare the two accounts. Here's an opportunity to check out investigator bias and also investigator emphasis. Not surprisingly, Beth Collings and Anna Jamerson emphasize connections more than Bryan. Of course they also include more information on their case. UFOs, MJ-12 AND THE GOVERNMENT:^ A Report on Government Involvement in the UFO Crash Retrievals (113 pages) by Grant Cameron and T.

Order From MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Seguin, TX 78155-4099 A PAGE 18 NUMBER 332 DECEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Ron Felber of \"Searchers\" by Sean Casteel R on Felber is a journalist and novelist who stum- bled onto the UFO and abduction fields almost by accident when a business associate of his told him a story which was recounted to Felber's associate by a couple the man considered to be among his best friends. The associate told Felber the tale of Steve and Dawn Hess, who had encountered what they took to be a UFO one weekend, an experience which lingered in their memories as one of extreme terror and from which they still had not recovered emotionally and psychologically. Felber admitted that he was at first skeptical of what he was hearing, and did not think the story worth pur- suing. When he actually met the Hesses, however, he was struck both by their sincerity and by the fact that the intense emotions with which they recounted their story served to indicate that something real had happened. Felber's further investigation into the Hesses case is documented in his book Searchers: A True Story of Alien Abduction (St. Martin's Press, 1995. paper, $4.99). I spoke to Felber by phone from his home in New Jersey, and asked him to briefly retell the story of the Hesses for the sake of newcomers to the couple's case. \"Here's a couple,\" Felber began, \"and the husband is an avid hunter and has missed a buck deer, a mule deer, that he had had a shot at the week before. And he missed the shot. Being a very competitive fellow, he wanted to go back. And because mule deer are pretty much terri- torial, he knew that if he returned to a pretty desolate area of the Mojave Desert, that he probably would be able to track this mule deer again. \"He invited his wife along,\" Felber continued. \"They go over a very rugged terrain that really starts to scare her. She's really had some bad premonitions about this whole thing. And it probably scares him a little bit too in the sense that it is totally desolate. They get there and they're cooking some steaks. He looks up and sees a UFO and it's a real eerie feeling, a spine-tingling sensation. A couple of hours later, when it really becomes dark, they see nine glowing orbs in the sky. He tries to explain it away with weather bal- loons, military craftâ€”anything that his wife might buy other than UFOs. \"Then, all of a sudden,'\" Felber went on. \"they look out andâ€”it's the blink of an eyeâ€”they see over Table Top Mountain, this truncated mountain range, a sprawl- ing 'M.' These nine glowing orbs have formed a sprawl- ing 'M.' Soon after that, the entire nighttime sky be- comes filled with hundreds of shining objects that start Ron Felber descending and then rushing towards them from perhaps five hundred yards away. \"At this point, Steve Hess was contemplating fighting them off with his shotgun, while his wife Dawn is think- ing what they're seeing is some kind of military invasion from who knows? The Russians? Then Dawn is told telepathically \"Get in the back of the camper, and you won't be hurt. Try to resist us and you will be killed.\" She convinces Steve to get into the back of the camper with her. Over the next several hours, they will encounter four different types of aliens. \"Two stump-like beings,\" Felber said, \"gray, almost electrical force-type beings, stand guard at the lip of the camper so they cannot get out. The camper has windows all along the sides, and they just stare out and they see hundreds of pairs of red eyes just staring back at them. And these are the second type of beingsâ€”these gremlin, monkeylike beings, very frisky, malevolent, agitated and weightless. They actually hang on the branches of trees without bending the branches. \"Every nighttime sound stops,\" Felber goes on. \"What they see next are illuminated beings. Shiny, glowing, let's call them four feet in height. They have the bodies, perhaps, of a five-year old, three fingers, and their heads are oversized with almond eyes. Steve and Dawn have opportunities to look into the eyes, and they DECEMBER 1995 NUMBER 332 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL see a kind of vortex. No pupils. It's sort of like a funnel that goes down to nothing. It's frightening. From there, they endure tremendous psychological torment that brings them literally to the brink of madness and close to heart failure on more than one occasion. They're made to relive horrible life-time experiences. They're pro- jected into terrible circumstances where Steve, for ex- ample, livedâ€”not in visionâ€”but literally lived out a fantasy where he is pursued, killed and gutted like an an- imal, where his wife relives a rape, where they both have visions, but again, they're so real that they literally, physically react to them. \"They went through a real roller coaster of emo- tions,\" Felber said. ''Their feeling was that they were put through these emotions so that the beings could study how human emotions work. When they were at the very brink of madness, an angelic presence, the fourth and fi- nal type of being, made itself visible, telling them to bear with things, that they're almost through it, and so they were.\" But the \"problem\" didn't go away. When the Hesses returned to their home in La Mirada, California, they felt their bed was surrounded by these beings. They could smell them and see them, and they experienced a disquieting sensation of being watched. They discovered two puncture wounds on the side of Dawn's neck, which, under hypnosis later, she was convinced were made for the sake of inserting track- ing devices. I n the aftermath of their initial experience, the Hesses sought the comfort of religion to help them cope with the strangeness of what had happened to them and the lingering shock that plagues most abductees. \"The Hesses became devout Mormons,\" Felber said. \"Their lives were in a shambles, literally. Steve lost his job and he had no motivation to do anything. Everything he tried to do seemed 'dwarfed' by the experience. Dawn became obsessed with UFOs. All she talked about and all she read dealt with UFOs. They turned to religion because their children started to be affected.\" Felber said that one evening at home they heard one of their children scream. They ran into his room and found their five-year old son Steve Jr. in a trance-like state and spinning like a top. They stopped him and put him back in his bed, and the boy said, \"Don't turn the lights out!\" \"Why?\" his mother asked. The boy an- swered, \"Because when you turn the lights out, the little monsters come.\" Dawn tried to tell him there was no such thing as monsters, to which the child replied, \"Oh, yes there are. They're small and they're ugly and they have red eyes.\" The Hesses said they had very conscientiously tried not to discuss their experiences in front of the children and thus found this incident doubly upsetting. \"As a result,\" Felber said, \"they turned to the Mormon Church, which was Dawn's background, loosely, and became devout Mormons. They wound up moving to Salt Lake City, and, believe it or not, when the hardback version of Searchers came out, they shared it with their bishop, who demanded that the book be re- moved from his house, that it was the work of Satan, and that their family was possessed by demons. And that they had to refrain from any support of this project.\" The Mormon Church even asked Felber to discon- tinue his relationship with the Hesses. \"Up until that time,\" Felber said, \"I stayed in contact with the family. But then I got a letter from a Mormon attorney, an at- torney who represents the Mormon Church, requesting that I desist from any further contact with the family.\" Felber said that he had done as requested and has re- luctantly stepped out of the family's situation. As to what it all means, Felber's belief is that the alien abduction phenomenon is not \"something new under the sun. My gut take on this whole thing,\" he said, \"is that, if you put military stuff aside, and put the- ories about child abuse, which John Mack might talk about, put that aside, my feeling is that this is sort of an ancient phenomenon and not a new one. That this phe- nomenon, these kinds of abductions, although they wouldn't call them 'abductions' five hundred years ago or a thousand years ago. have been going on for a long time. And they've been side by side with the reality we know right now. There are forces at work that influ- ence the lives of human beings and have for a long, long time.\" Felber said he had a memory from his childhood which helped him put the matter in a clearer perspective. \"I remembered something I learned in grammar school,\" he said, \"which was a Catholic grammar school, about miracles. One of the ways the Catholic Church gauges whether something is really a miracle is, did it change that person's life dramatically? Meaning, did whatever happened, was it so out of context for this person that their entire life changed? And that was one way of val- idating that a miracle had occurred. \"I applied that same criterion in an odd way to this story,\" Felber concluded, \"and said, 'Here are people that had good careers, had a stable home, stable family, no real pressures to speak of, nothing outside of the or- dinary. But one experience, on a weekend in the desert, literally turned their whole life upside down. What could do that that I've ever encountered?' And the answer, re- ally, is nothing. Nothing that I've ever encountered or known of. So, at some point in time, my gut tells me that Steve and Dawn are going to wake up one morning and say, 'You know, this just isn't right.' And this story will continue.\" Sean Casteel is a freelance writer with an interest in UFOs and a frequent contributor to these pages. He lives in Ventura, California.

Early in the month Mercury can be found some 15 to 20Â° below our dazzling neighbor planet, and lading Mars some 5Â° or so below Mercury. (You'll need binoculars and an unob- structed horizon, however, to glimpse the latter two objects.) Mars sets an hour after sunset on the 1st. A crescent Moon lies to the right of Venus on January 22. Saturn, in Aquarius, closes rapidly with Venus throughout the month in the SW, finally approaching to within 2Â° above the brighter planet at month's end. This world with rings sets about 10 PM on the 1st and about 8 PM on the 31st. Telescopically, Saturn is worth watching as Earth again nears the giant's ring plane. Sunlight shining from below the rings causes the north face of the system to appear as a dark line across the planet. Late in January the rings' shadow itself be- comes increasingly pronounced as it is cast onto the planet's oval face. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter, in Sagittarius, emerges into the SE morning sky. ris- ing about 5:45 in mid-January. It can be seen below the lunar crescent on the 18th. Moon Phases: Full moon â€” January 5 Last quarter â€” January 13 New Moon â€” January 20 First quarter â€” January 27 The Stars: O C The night sky of January features some of the brightest stars in the heavens. Orion the Hunter now dominates the southern sky and with its characteristic hourglass figure is perhaps the easiest of all the constellations to spot. Because of its position above the equator, Orion is visible from many places on Earth. The pattern played an important role in the mythol- ogy of cultures throughout the world. The great warrior serves as a guidepost to almost all of the in- teresting stars of the season. A line through the three belt stars toward the SE points to the brightest luminary in the night sky. Sirius the Dog Star. The same line extended in the opposite di- rection points to the fiery eye of the Bull Taurus, the star Aldebaran. The tiny star cluster called the Pleiades is supposed to be a spear-wound in the bull's shoulder. Aldebaran and Sirius are two of the Ist-magnitude stars which form the Winter Circle surrounding Orion. Don't forget to look at the fuzzy middle \"star\" in the hunter's sword â€” the great Orion Nebula, a glowing cloud of gas and dust and a seasonal favorite of amateur astronomers. Finally, a trip to the country will afford a view in the darkened rural sky of the Milky Way, our star city home in the universe.

Everyone will be advised twice in advance that their membership/subscription will expire within two months. Please renew when you receive the first notice, especially in foreign countries where it takes two to three months for surface mail to be deliv- ered. The last notice will indicate with a red check that your subscription \"expires with this issue.\" If a person allows their subscription to expire, it will be resumed with the next current issue. Back issues, when available, may be purchased for $3 each for those that you may have missed. When new members join, their first issue will begin with the next current issue.

SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS COVER DESIGN CONTEST The theme for the MUFON 1996 International UFO Symposium is \"UFOLOGY: A Scientific Enigma.\" We endeavor to depict this theme in the cover artwork. Obviously, this requires considerable ingenuity and something unique in design. The 8 1/2\" x 11\" size will be printed in black on a light pastel color leatherette stock. Since small and intricate details do not print well on a leatherette stock, please take this into consideration in your design. The winning design may also be used on the symposium program in Greensboro, NC. The dead- line for submission is April 15, 1996. The winner will receive an honorarium of $ 100 cash plus $100 worth of MUFON publications of your choice. Good luck. DECEMBER 1995 NUMBER 332 PAGE 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Walter Andrus NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP/SUBSCRIPTION INCREASE It may seem amazing to most Journal readers that the annual membership/subscription price has not increased for nine and one-half years, whereas inflation, paper, printing costs, employee labor, and postage charges have raised significantly. The more expensive kem- coated Journal cover is a radical improvement over the light-weight yellow cover on the February 1986 issue, giving our magazine a professional appearance along with the overall quality improvement in the contents. We were able to hold the annual price at $25 in the U.S.A. and $30 foreign through a steady increase in subscrip- tions and by supplementing publishing costs and labor from other sources. The Journal is our most important communication medium to our members worldwide, however it must be financially supportive of itself, not a liability. MUFON overhead has increased substantially over the past five years with the employment of the International Director, Assistant to the Director. UFO Database Administrator, and the Abduction Transcription Project Manager who were all formerly volunteers. Support income from the Bigelow Foundation to fund expansion and research was abruptly discontinued in July 1995, necessitating a study of MU- FON's financial status so as to continue its solvency. In both the September and October issues of the Journal, all readers were advised of the study being conducted by the Executive Committee on a new dues structure. As the world's leading UFO organization, we want to continue to cultivate membership worldwide. However, we are cognizant of the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to foreign currency in many countries, where the sub- scription price is already prohibitive for the average person who would like to join MUFON. The MUFON Board of Directors has recommended that the annual membership/subscription price in the U.S.A. be in- creased from $25 to $30 and retain the present $30 for foreign countries. It has also been recommended that a study should be conducted three years hence (1998) for a similar evaluation of MUFON's financial status to determine the validity of this increase. The new dues structure will become effective January 1. 1996. The cover price for a single copy will remain at $3. We pride ourselves for having published the finest monthly UFO magazine in the world and expect to con- tinue to do so with your loyal support. The UFO enigma still represents the greatest mystery of the space age. therefore your most valuable asset to staying abreast of the phenomenon is your monthly MUFON UFO Journal magazine.

MUFON NATIONAL UFO HOTLINE MUFON has been cautiously introducing its National UFO Hotline 1-800-UFO-2I66 or 1-800-836-2166 to the public. Designed to obtain UFO sighting reports from police agencies nationwide, we are now prepared to expand its coverage. All State Directors were ad- vised by a letter nearly a year ago to utilize this number for filing hot UFO cases that came to their attention. A letter announcing the 800 number was mailed to all sheriff's offices and police chiefs in Texas last spring as a means of testing and evaluating the effectiveness of the system. The majority of our calls, to-date, have been from people who called the 800 directory and asked for \"UFO\" to report sightings or to seek UFO information.
