Andrus, Jr., International Director T he exponential growth of the Mutual UFO Network over the last several years has had both positive and negative ramifications as it relates to our technological objectives and overall philosophy relevant to the phenomenon known as Unidentified Flying Objects — UFOs. Some veteran members may have forgotten or lost sight of the organization's basic prin- ciples, while relatively new members may not be wholly aware of their formulation. In either case, it would be advantageous to review MUFON's fundamental objectives. We are dedicated to the express purpose of answering four basic questions: 1. Are UFOs some form of spacecraft controlled by an ad- vanced intelligence, conducting a surveillance of our planet, or do they constitute some unknown physical or psychological manifestation associated with the Planet Earth that is not understood by present day science? 2. If UFOs are found to be extraterrestrial craft controlled by intelligent beings, what is their method of propulsion and their means for achieving unbelievable speed and maneu- verability? 3. Postulating that they may be controlled by an extrater- restrial intelligence, where do they originate — our Earth, our solar system, in our galaxy, the Milky Way, in some distant galaxy in the universe, or in another dimension or time frame altogether? 4. Assuming that some of the craft are piloted by alien be- ings, humanoids or entities, what can we learn from their ap- parently advanced science and civilization through study or possibly through direct communications with the occupants of these vehicles? A nswers to these questions are as pertinent today as they were 23 years ago, when they were first proposed. We are not only vitally concerned with the technology involved in the propulsion of UFOs, but with the potential implica- tions and impact that the reality of extraterrestrial intelligence and visitations will have for mankind, both now and in the future. The importance of the scientific study of the UFO phenomenon cannot be underestimated, since it is the most significant mystery of the space age and the twenty-first cen- tury. We cannot overemphasize the significance of this enigma. Yet, we must be totally cognizant that the scientific study of the UFO phenomenon is entirely independent of, and has nothing in common with, the many rising New Age concepts, which even the so-called \"new agers\" themselves are unable to define. Attempted telepathic communication with the alleged entities, in other words, should not be construed as bona fide \"channeling from the masters,\" as several well-known char- latans have recently implied in their writings and lectures. To date, no scientific evidence relevant to the UFO phenomenon has been discovered through channeling, automatic writing or via the latest related fad — automated computer printout replies to questions posed to \"the masters.\" The study of the new science of Ufology has many peripheral subjects which may or may not prove relevant, however, and they deserve investigation by specialists to determine if they fit into the UFO puzzle. Examples are: human abductions, Big Foot, animal mutilations, theology, crop circles, govern- ment cover-up, ancient astronauts and astronomy. The Mutual UFO Network is a patriotic organization, but it abhors the failure of the U.S. Government to officially disclose its knowledge concerning UFOs and their continued visitations. For Congress to spend $100 million of taxpayers' money on the SETI program is absurd. Even actively involved astronomers admit that there is only an infinitesimal chance that they may receive a signal from an intelligent source through their efforts. MUFON is proposing that a far more cost- effective program in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence could be mounted by allocating $500,000 to $1 million to the study of reports of technologically-advanced entities who have been visiting the Planet Earth for at least 50 years. For 45 years, intelligence agencies within the U.S. Govern- ment have been covertly and systematically conducting a cover- up of the UFO enigma while deliberately prevaricating to the citizens of our country and the nations of the world. Documents recovered under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) con- firm beyond a question of doubt the authenticity of this state- ment. So when is our government going to \"come clean\"? Such a disclosure would dwarf the admitted lies surrounding the Gary Powers' U-2 flight over the U.S.S.R., Watergate, and the more current Irangate. Obviously, the credibility of the U.S. Government and its leaders would suffer even more in the eyes of the world should the President of the United States make a public pronouncement revealing that UFOs and their occupants are indeed a reality. But as the evidence mounts, eventually one of our presi- dents will be forced to face the truth. Both Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan have already shared their UFO experiences with the public. As a former Director of the Central Intel- ligence Agency, George Bush is probably more knowledge- able about UFOs than any previous president. When recently queried by one of MUFON's State Section Directors, serv- ing on Bush's campaign committee, about his knowledge of UFOs and the CIA, Bush responded briefly in the tape- recorded statement — \"You don't know the half of it.\" The $64,000 question still confronts a future President of the United States. Which one will have the intestinal for- titude to \"face the music\"? Or conversely, will the govern- ment continue to leak UFO information to the press and electronic media for public consumption as they are ap- parently now doing? We cannot tolerate another 45 more years of indecision, the purpose of which is to shield the most important scientific mystery of the century from the citizens of the world. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Introduction I've been asked on occasion why the Journal devotes so much space to the crop circle mystery. I'd thought the reasons might be obvious by now, but in case they aren't, let me explain. In the beginning, not so very long ago, crop circles seemed to be very similar in appearance to those UFO physical trace cases popularly known as \"saucer nests\" — circular areas of swirled-flat grass or grain reported after the visual sighting of a day- time or other UFO. See in particular, the five circles found near Langenburg, Saskatchewan, in Septem- ber of 1974, or those at Tully, Queensland, Australia, in January of 1966. Although their numbers are small today, some cereologists still think that crop circles share a certain intimacy with the UFO phenomenon, although not necessarily as one-to- one physical impressions of the latter. On the other hand, some UFO reports could be connected to some crop circles, if, say, the plasma- vortex theory of Dr. Terence Meaden could be demonstrated in a convincing light. That hasn't hap- pened yet, but the possibility, however remote, is surely enough to keep the subject alive in these pages. But there is another factor, somewhat more sub- tle, that is also important to keep in mind, and that is the fact that by observing how crop circles are thought about, we can also gain an insight into how UFOs are sometimes thought about, and scientifical- ly approached (or not). Certainly, there is a discon- certing tendency among many contemporary ufologists to see government agents and conspiracies lurking behind every bush or cloud. I know this to be an unpleasant fact of life personally, having once been accused of being on an intelligence agency's payroll myself. The article you are about to read paints the wide- spread paranoia within both ufology and cereology in a painful light, but it needs to be seen (and said) nevertheless. The events leading up to it don't par- ticularly redound to anyone's credit. The perpetrators of the original incident, for example, should have known that they were playing with fire, a fire that, once started, would prove extremely difficult to stamp out. Hopefully, hoaxers will realize that their pranks are often the equal of a misguided social experiment over which they have no ultimate control. In other words, there are lessons here aplenty — on both sides of the equation — for everyone involved. Several of the parties mentioned herein have been contacted and asked to respond. Those responses, assuming they are forthcoming, will appear in a future issue of the Journal. — Dennis Stacy By James Schnabel M en in Black! Covert operatives! Govern- ment agents! Any ufologist worth his salt knows about these types ... who work night and day to discredit, to disinform, to debunk, and generally to prevent the Public from apprehend- ing the Truth. Surely you have heard of them, the pokerfaced gentlemen (and maybe even ladies) who lurk behind government-gray desks, in smoke-filled corporate boardrooms, in the coffee-stained news- rooms of the press, and even — shudder! — in the crowded conference halls of ufology itself ... The types who whisper tersely off the record, no attribu- tion allowed, as they point to grainy top-secret photographs of the crashed alien captives and their craft: \"The... World... Is... Not... Ready... For... This... Yet.\" Ufology, it would appear, is perpetually plagued by spies. And given that ufologists seem dispropor- tionately likely to list, among their present or former employers, the CIA, DIA, DOD, NSA, MOD, M15, M16, or various other nefarious omnipotences, it is hardly surprising that so many ufologists, famous and obscure, have themselves been accused of anti- ufological espionage. My god, the stories one hears! \"X claims to believe in such-and-such. No one could seriously believe in such-and-such; therefore X is a debunker working for the government.\" \"Y is a spy because she accuses other people of being spies. She must be trying to divert attention from her own activities.\" \"Z is too quiet. He is probably a spy, too.\" Crop circle researchers, who occupy a fertile but relatively small patch of ufology, and who mostly reside in genteel England, are nevertheless among the most vociferous spycriers. If you believe some influential cerealogists, spies and wreckers are everywhere: The crop circle hoaxers Doug Bower and Dave Chorley are pawns in a government con- spiracy to debunk the circles (and especially the lovely pictograms). The newspaper who published their story is also working with the government, as is a features syndicate which supplied crop circle photographs to the newspaper. A landowner in Somerset whose farm happens to have the same name as a copyright tag used by the aforesaid newspaper, has, suspiciously, been known to per- form \"defense-related work for the government.\" The retired physics professor who favors a meteorological explanation for a few small circles, Schnabel is an American journalist living in Oxford, England. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"It all began on a Sunday evening in late August...\" and the hoax explanation for the rest, is clearly an agent of Her Majesty's government. A journalist who is current- ly working on a book about the evolution of sex, but whose previous credits include skeptical articles about the circles, and who is a nephew of a former minister of the Thatcher government, is obviously too close to government not to be a spy. A female journalist who has written over a dozen books and novels about the occult and strange phenomena, who is working on a book about the circles, and who heads a North American crop circle research group, has been linked to a CIA contract employee (who is not only a circles en- thusiast but an arch-conspiracy theorist as well), and is therefore clearly up to no good. A freelance commercial photographer, recently converted to crop circles skepticism, has therefore become a circle-hoaxer, and could not be do- ing so other than under government auspices and with debunking intent. Last, but not least, there is the journalist who has written two articles implying that cerealogy is a serious science, but who has also written two other articles examining the intrigues and the hoaxing that go on within cerealogy; worse, he is said to be a circle-making accomplice of the aforementioned photographer; worst of all, he is \"a staunch Catholic;\" his spying and debunking activities therefore have a religious motivation. T hat is all by way of background to my story, which is about the latter individual — me — and what hap- pened to him when, in a light-hearted moment, he suggested to an inquirer that, yes, it was all true, he was indeed a spy. I doubt that many people connected with ufology have ever survived to tell about such an experience. It all began on a Sunday evening in late August, when a man describing himself as a citizen of Kenya and calling himself \"Cassava Ntumba\" — or something like that — telephoned a circles researcher named Rob Irving. Irving, who is the photographer mentioned above, recently had worked with me on a piece in a London newspaper about one of the circle-making groups which has been active in Wiltshire. Ntumba explained that he was interested in the circles phenomenon, but Irving immediately recognized his voice as that of Henry Azadehdel, who had played a major role last year in whipping up the story about Bower and Chorley being spies. Now, Henry Azadehdel is a story in himself, but for our purposes here it is enough to mention that he goes by several names (Dr. Armen Victorian and Dr. Alan Jones among them), is believed to have oozed originally out of then - Soviet Armenia, or Iran, or Iraq, or Libya, was convicted in 1989 of smuggling rare orchids into the U.K. and spent six weeks in Pentonville Prison, and has been involved in a number of other remarkable enterprises, one of the most recent of which involved the marketing of what purported to be a page from Ronald Reagan's diary, making clear that Reagan knew all along about the arms-for-hostages swap with Iran in the early 1980s. A veritable Renaissance Man, our Henry. A nyway, Irving slapped a tape recorder on the phone and the fun started. Ntumba wanted to know if Irv- ing, or his friend Schnabel, knew of any government interest in the circles. Irving hinted that he did, and that he and Schnabel were the manifestation of this government interest. Ntumba: Is it [to do with] Intelligence? —forgive me, it's my curiosity — or maybe — Irving: It does have intelligence, yeah. Ntumba: But — Irving: / think that we're particularly intelligent people. Ntumba: What? Well, yes. I see ... And so on in this vein, with Irving giving Azadehdel a mixture of insulting wordplay and deadpan hints about an international conspiracy, until he tired of the game and asked: Irving: How's [W], by the way? Ntumba: Who? Irving: [W]. Ntumba: Who is [W]? Irving: fWJ. I understand you know [W] (a well-known British circles researcher, with whom Azadehdel had worked before, and who clearly had sent Azadehdel in search of information about us). Ntumba: / — Irving: You're Henry Azjadehdel. Ntumba: No I'm not. Irving: You're not? Ntumba: Uh-uh. Irving: Dr. Victorian? Ntumba: No, I'm not. Irving: You sound incredibly like him. Ntumba: I've heard of this man [Azadehdel] before. What do you make of him? Irving: / think he's [comment deleted — Ed]. T he conversation thereafter became fairly heated, and it ended shortly, with Ntumba-Azadehdel threatening to \"blow your cover, Mr. Irving,\" and hinting that Irving might avoid such a fete if he \"bet\" Azadehdel £100,000. Since Azadehdel at one point had asked for my phone number, Irving called me as soon as the conversation had finished, and played his tape of the discussion. I told Irving that if Azadehdel called me, I would feign ignorance of the previous discussion, and lead Azadehdel on a spy-chase around the globe. Well, Azadehdel phoned up in about 15 minutes. By then I was having dinner with some friends, so I asked him to call back later. He did, and pretending to stonewall at first, I gradually let it be known that he had won my confidence (\"Are you a Christian?\" I asked him. \"Yes, yes,\" he said, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"The Plan was super-secret, supra-national, and had tens of thousands of dedicated members ... / threw in Germany just to give the thing a more NATO-ish flavor.\" \"I am a Christian. I am a Catholic.\")- This accomplished, I began to sketch — both in that conversation, and in a briefer one the following day — the basic outlines of The Plan. The governments of the UK, U.S. A, and Germany were involved. The Vatican was involved, too. Military intelligence services of host countries would lend us support from time to time, as necessary. Several noted crop circle researchers (some of whom had previously been accused of being spies) were also involved. The Organization behind The Plan was super-secret, supra-national, and had tens of thousands of dedicated members. We were very well paid, and we lacked no resources. The Plan was meant (a) to divert attention from the ultra-secret Star Wars weapons testing which caused the circles, and (b) to discredit those who were using the phenomenon to promote the New Age. Now, a note on the somewhat impromptu structure of The Plan: I figured that any good British conspiracy had to in- volve not only the British government, but the even more omnipotent U.S. government as well. I threw in Germany just to give the thing a more NATO-ish flavor, and because two of my flatmates were German, and because a prominent cerealogist who has suggested to me that the circles might be the result of space weapons testing is also German. The Vatican v. New Age angle was a direct response to cerealogist W's belief that I was some kind of mad debunking monk. W ell, a few days went by, and the reports started to come in on the crop circles grapevine. W believed that his house was bugged, and so he was communicating only by fax. The faxed messages implied that he had finally cracked the crop circles debunking conspiracy, and would soon ex- pose all. R was telling everybody about it, too. E was up in Scotland, at H's place, with W and some others, listening to the tapes and marvelling at the breathtaking breadth of The Plan. Even W's colleague R, an experienced journalist, had difficulty in believing that the thing was only a joke. Almost exactly a week after Azadehdel's first call, he phoned Irving again. Irving explained that he had spoken to me and that I had assured him that Ntumba was shortly to become a member of The Organization. Ntumba carried on as if their first conversation had never occurred, pep- pering Irving with the usual questions. How much will I be paid? What will I be asked to do? What was The Organiza- tion called? \"The Swan,\" said Irving, because in England one,is not allowed to harm a swan. Irving suggested that The Swan's mission was to infiltrate all fringe groups until we had established ... control. A fter Irving played me the tape from that final conver- sation, I began to worry. For a variety of reasons it didn't seem plausible that Azadehdel believed The Plan; yet he had continued to call, had continued to dig further. It was as if he were playing the same game, giving W and the others what they wanted, editing the tapes to make the whole thing sound more plausible, and having his own laugh, maybe even making money out of it. It occurred to me that The Plan, or the edited version thereof, would be broad- cast worldwide, or anyway among the international cerealogical and ufological community, and any denials that followed might be greeted with disbelief and derision. Coin- cidentially, I had just read an article in Fortean Times* about a program made by a British TV company in the late 1970s. Called \"Alternative 3,\" it had described a plot by world governments secretly to colonize the Moon and Mars with top scientists, who would presumably be the only ones to escape the oncoming ecological catastrophe. A masterly weave of various pop mythologies, it had spawned a minor hysteria in England before its producers declared that the whole thing had been a hoax. But even afterwards, many continued to believe in the essential truth of the story, assert- ing that the hoax claim had really been a \"cover up.\" Which demonstrated that sometimes you couldn't get the genie back into the bottle again. That was what was worry- ing me. I took a genuine interest in UFOs, crop circles, and other strange phenomena, as a journalist and as a researcher of the phenomena themselves, and I didn't relish the pros- pect of having doors slammed in my face — spy! — whenever I tried to investigate a story. So I telephoned W and asked him to relay to the elusive Azadehdel that the whole thing had been a send up. \"I hope\" — I said — \"that you have enough sense of humor to see that this was all done in fun.\" To which W responded: \"Well I'm not sure I do, Jim. I mean, I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if you were a spy.\" He wasn't joking, and he soon put the finishing touches on a long article, for a magazine which he edits, describing The Plan, The Swan, and two of its junior members, Schnabel and Irving. One of W's colleagues, whom we'll call G, was then in touch with a television production com- pany doing a crop circles documentary. G telephoned the producer, F, explained that his house and phone were bugged, and that he needed to speak to F in person; it was a matter, he said, of \"urgent national interest.\" He visited F and provided her with tapes (made by Azadehdel) of the Azadehdel-Schnabel conversations. On camera, G discussed The Plan and how it would soon be revealed to devastating effect. Meanwhile U, another cerealogist, sat down and wrote me a three-page letter, which among other things said: \"I note that you have subsequently passed off your con- versation with 'Ntumba' as being in the nature of a joke. And if that is indeed your preferred position, so be it. If, on the other hand, your statements were meant to be fac- tual (inadvertently or otherwise), I think it could now possibly be of advantage to you and your colleagues, as well * ' 'Hoax! Alternative 3,\" by Bob Richard. Fortean Times #64, pp. 47-9. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"as to the subject more generally, to take into account my owns... connections with the phenomenon and to consider whether you would like to exchange further information with me on a personal basis.\" N ewspapers, press agencies, and television networks in the U.K. apparently were informed of The Plan by press release. Some of the press releases came not from the crop circles research community but from an organization known as Quest International, a UFO research group in West York- shire. Azadehdel, under the name Armen Victorian, was (and as far as I know still is) one of the leading lights of Quest, and is a regular contributor to its journal — UFO Magazine — usually on matters relating to espionage. Quest held a con- ference in Leeds in late September, and Armen Victorian, billed as a \"former diplomat\" with links to the world of in- telligence, was one of the main speakers. He was scheduled to talk about an alleged UFO cover-up organization called The Aviary, another such organization called MJ-12, and of course our own homespun Swan. The day of the conference, the following notice appeared in a respected national newspaper, The Guardian. The reporter had teasingly scrambled all three conspiracies together: ANTI-UFO TALK THAT'S STRICTLY FOR THE BIRDS Calling Penguin, Falcon and the Owl: stand by to be assigned to your other duties. Despite your efforts to have flying saucers written off as rogue weather balloons and crop circles at- tributed to rural pranksters, public interest in paranormal ex- otica remains resistant to dirty tricks. Even worse, you are to be unmasked in front of 400 ufolo- gists. The highlight of a UFO-meet at Leeds Civic Theatre today promises to be the exposure of the double agents who have \"helped brand us a load of idiots,\" according to Tony Dodd, director of investigations for the conference organizers, Quest International. The audience will hear taped conversations of the gang of international debunkers — group code name: the Birds — revealing the role they have played in giving ufology, etc., a bad name. The Birds are said to be linked to the military intelligence agencies of several nations ... The tapes were gathered by Armen Victorian, a Nottingham-based former diplomat whom the Birds allegedly tried in vain to recruit ... \"We've had quiet talks with some of them and they are always saying 'The world is not ready for this yet,' \" complained Mr. Dodd. I went up to the conference with some friends, and we filed unostentatiously into the theatre. But word of my presence seemed to get around pretty quickly. People I didn't know began to stare at me. One guy seemed to be following me around. Another guy across the auditorium looked at me carefully and then walked hurriedly away and consulted with another guy, and then they both looked at me. Yet another guy tried to take my picture. My friends told me I was im- agining things, but in the first lecture, and in virtually every lecture thereafter, it was said darkly that some of the very spies to be revealed that day were among the audience, listening, taking notes, making tape-recordings, devising Plans ... Now, two days earlier, I had sent to the Quest conference's master of ceremonies, a burly fellow whom we'll call T, a tape of the Irving-Azadehdel and Schnabel-Azadehdel conver- sations, along with a short note explaining that the conversa- tions represented nothing more than a hoax. Yet he made no mention of this when he promised the audience: \"I can tell you that what you will hear today will reverberate throughout the world's UFO communities.\" C, a well-known author of crop circles books, who now described himself as having \"advised the Thatcher govern- ment\" on the phenomenon, was one of the featured lecturers. He warned that attempts would soon be made by the media to debunk the circles. He mentioned F's documentary as an example (for F had resisted the calls to broadcast The Plan) and claimed that it would be broadcast one month ahead of schedule \"because such is the frenzy of activity in the intelligence fraternity\" with regard to the circles. C also discussed the executors of The Plan, who were, he assured the audience, involved with the governments of \"Britain, the USA and Germany.\" C had recently been in the USA, and there, he claimed, he had described the con- spiracy to his good friend B, a respected UFO reseacher. B, according to C, had been concerned about what the agents of The Plan might do to him. C emphasized to the audience that these agents — who were \"blackness ... blackness itself — must be stopped at all costs. D, a well-known and apparently earnest British ufologist whose quest started with a close encounter some years ago, also discussed The Plan and how only the brave efforts of ufologists could prevent its dark success. Then, by some twisted synchronicity, he mentioned another conspiracy ... one which accidentally had been broadcast on television in the 1970s ... involving the abduction of the world's top scien- tists, secret bases on the Moon and Mars, the coming ecological catastrophe, and the desperate attempts by Govern- ment to cover up the conspiracy by passing it off as a hoax. The clock wound down and finally Armen Victorian took the stage. Hearing him on the phone, I had imagined a gray- ing, chain-smoking, carpet-salesman type, in his mid-fifties with a shabby brown suit and bad teeth. But in reality (or whatever reality that afternoon can be said to have had) he was a dapper little Napoleon in his thirties, about four foot eleven in his tidy tan suit. He started off right away with the crop circles conspiracy, explaining that, as we thought, he had begun to investigate after a fax from his friend W. After a few audio problems, he played excerpts from my conversations with him. For example: Ntumba: [N] was very quiet. Is he also working in the same — ? Schnabel: / wouldn't want to speak about further things. It's MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"extremely sensitive. 1 really shouldn 't have told you all that I've told you already ... Ntumba: Ohhh, I seeeee. Well, I hope, you know, that the mission will be accomplished, after all this time. Schnabel: We have no doubt of success. Ntumba: Well, I'm delighted to hear that. Now, about the payments. How do we claim for the expenses, etcetera? How do we go about this ...? Schnabel: That will all be arranged and explained to you, if — Ntumba: Is it on a monthly basis? Schnabel: — if you're found to be a suitable — Ntumba: Candidate. Schnabel: — candidate, yes. But [the remuneration is] extremely generous. Don't worry about that. Ntumba: OK. Do you know if there's a great deal of travel- ing backwards and forwards ... ? Schnabel: You will be expected to travel internationally. Ntumba: Oh, that's fascinating, fascinating. That is absolutely fascinating. What sort of data would they be expecting, you know, from my side to be gathered, to be collected, for the Cause? Schnabel: Well, it would be not only gathering data but also taking active measures, possibly conducting disinformation campaigns ... and other measures. Ntumba: In order to safeguard ... the ultimate goal? Schnabel: Yes, it's extremely complex. I mean, I think you touched upon it briefly last night when you mentioned the weapons — Ntumba: / was very much impressed! Schnabel: — the weapons systems. There's the element of the weapons testing and there's the second element, the at- tempt to use the phenomenon of the circles to discredit the New Age movement and other such movements. Ntumba: / see. I seeeeee. W hen the taped excerpts ran out, Azadehdel explained to the audience whom the conspiratorial voice belonged to: an American journalist, Jim Schnabel, who had written articles for several well known publications. Although Azadehdel went on to slander me recklessly, it seemed that he had been making inquiries of other people about me, presumably in the same manner with which he had approached me initially. It was a disquieting thought. When question time came, after an unscheduled half-hour break in which half of the audience left for home, I was finally given a chance to respond. I stood and pointed out that I was Schnabel, the alleged spy, and that — honestly, folks — the whole crop circles conspiracy thing had been a put-on, a sham all the way. Standing in front of the stage, calling on the ques- tioners, was the conference emcee, T. I asked him if I could ask Dr. Victorian a series of brief questions. He said that there was too little time for that and that I could only ask one ques- tion. \"What is your question?\" demanded Victorian from his seat on the stage. \"Sit down,\" said a voice somewhere behind me in the audience. I asked the only question which I could think of: was Dr. Victorian in feet Henry Azadehdel, the convicted criminal? \"That's not a question, that's a statement,\" said Victorian. \"That's not a question, that's a statement,\" echoed T who, ironically, was in ordinary life a prison guard. I felt that the audience was against me. \"Sit down,\" said the voice in the back. I asked my question again, and got the same stony reply from Azadehdel and T. Then T moved on to the next ques- tioner, who wanted to know about the New Age and when it would arrive. The guy in the back again muttered, \"Sit down.\" I did. N ow, looking back on it, the whole experience seems utterly ridiculous, not worthy of any anxiety or analysis at all. But for a brief, gray moment there in the Civic Theatre at Leeds, as I sunk down into my seat under the weight of scorn and disbelief thrown at me from all sides, with the feeling that nothing I could say would convince them of the truth, I think I glimpsed what it must have been like for the victims of the Spanish Inquisition, or the Salem Witch Trials, or the Stalin purges, or Senator McCarthy's Un-American Activities Committee, or any of the stupid injustices, which are apt to be done when people answer too eagerly the call of the herd. In my case, I shouldn't have worried. After the conference ended, I was surrounded by sympathetic people. \"What was that all about?\" they asked. \"Is there something this guy Vic- torian isn't telling us?\" \"Was it really a hoax?\" Twenty-four hours later, the fever had broken completely. I spoke to B, who had been one of the featured speakers at Leeds, and he told me that he had never liked the look of this Azadehdel character. Rob Irving received phone calls from the noted cerealogists M and G, who seemed to be speaking on behalf of their organization. Somehow, they at last had heard tapes of the first call between Irving and Azadehdel (the lat- ter had claimed to them, apparently, that he hadn't taped the first call), and they had realized that it all had been a hoax, just as we had said. W's magazine had been pulled from the printers, and the article detailing The Plan had been removed. M and G congratulated Irving and me on our acting ability. They and their colleagues henceforth would look more close- ly at any material emerging from Ambassador Victorian. It had been a regrettable experience for everyone. They hoped that it could all be put behind them. They wished now that they had taken our hoax admission, two weeks before, at fece value. But in all of this, Irving and I noticed, in all of this ap- parent embarassment and remorse on the part of the cerealo- gists, there was a hint of unsolved mystery, a reluctance to let go of The Plan, a tantalizing wisp of still-secret intrigue that lingered, like a fine English mist, and would go on linger- ing, even after the episode itself had passed into the distance of absurd and forgotten history. For with regard to Irving and me and The Plan, it seemed, certain cerealogists were still unable to answer the question — How had we known so much?

Many mil- lions of messages traverse telephone wires or the airwaves via satellite daily, as more and more people electronically interrelate with one another. There are approximately 60 million computers being used on a daily basis for such varied purposes as writing, composing, drawing, analyzing, read- ing, programming and playing games. Of these, approximate- ly 25 % are equipped with modems, which allow the user to connect with any other computer similarly equipped and to transfer messages and files back and forth across the coun- try and, indeed, around the world. Technology has enabled almost everyone to enter into this fascinating arena, sometimes referred to as cyberspace, and to do so with little or no understanding of computer languages and programming expertise. It is now possible to configure most computers for online communications by simply attaching a cable between the modem and computer, plugging the modem into the phone line (any existing voice line will do fine) and typing in the name of a communica- tions program. Then, with a few additional keystrokes, the user is ready to go \"on-line\" or log-on. There's even more good news for those whose computers are not currently equipped with modems; the cost of this technology has declined with the increase in its popularity. Moderately fast 2400 baud modems are now available for around $50, while 9600 baud high-speed modems, which cost $1000 or more just a few years ago, can now be ob- tained for about $250. Most also include communications software as a bonus. What does all this mean to the \"UFO Community\"? Megabytes of Information Daily Countless messages and data-files are sent around the world every day and night. The topics involved and the in- formation available are of such magnitude that it would be physically impossible to access and store all of it, much less use the bulk of the data proficiently. This vehicle for communication is virtually unlimited. Graphics can be sent and viewed, discussions can be held in \"real-time,\" news instantly retrieved and letters sent in a matter of seconds, compared to a mailed letter traveling John Komar, MUFON's state director for Tennessee, is the ad- ministrator of the MufoNet-BBS Network/Group. Contributing author, Pete Theer, is the director of the MufoNet Databank. through various postal facilities during its circuitous trip to the recipient, which usually takes several days, assuming it arrives at all! With respect to the various areas of research involving UFOs and related topics, the amount of data currently available, and new data arriving daily, still presents a for- midable task to sort through, categorize and present in a logical, cohesive manner. This is the area of involvement — making this information accessible to you as a \"User\" — which the MufoNet-BBS Network has been immersed in for a number of years. The Network's primary purpose is to provide the topical, up-to-the-minute data necessary for the user to stay informed of daily happenings within the worldwide \"UFO Community.\" It would be virtually impossible for any magazine, news- letter or newspaper to correlate all the available data and publish it on a frequent basis. The time involved and the size of the printed material would make this approach cost- prohibitive, on both the publishing and readership end. Team Concept T he most logical manner in which to pursue access to the data is through a working relationship and sharing of goals, presenting the membership with the best informa- tion available on a timely basis. Working under a team con- cept, the MUFON Journal presents the best scientific research papers, documents and newsworthy items each month, while the MufoNet-BBS Network adds to this knowledge base daily: through messages which contain the opinions, thoughts and ideas of many MUFON members and the general public concerning diverse topics; and via data-files in the form of articles, news items, research find- ings and other information made available on a regular basis, both from inside and outside the \"UFO Community.\" Each individually-operated Bulletin Board System (BBS) associated with the MufoNet-BBS Network reflects its System Operator's (SysOp's) personal criteria and logical approach towards online communications and topics of in- terest, and is therefore diverse in nature. But in general, the following services are available to any MUFON member who avails him or herself of the opportunity. Message Areas The message areas are international in scope. Place a message on one MufoNet-BBS and within a day it will automatically be sent to other MufoNet Bulletin Boards in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand for reading and replies. This makes it possible for you to carry on a cohesive, electronic conversation with researchers and other interested individuals in any of these countries. In other words, you can find out what's currently going on in the UFO field halfway around the globe almost as it happens. • MUFONET: For MUFON Members within the U.S., MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

File Areas Every MufoNet-BBS will offer a wide range of text and program files, as each BBS is unique. However, each will offer the MUFON member a basic file setup as follows: • MUFON PUBLIC FILES: accessible by the member and the public. Covers a multitude of topics from sighting reports, crop circles, and ETs to F.O.I.A. information. For MUFON Field Investigators and professional re- searchers involved in current cases or who wish to increase their knowledge of the far-ranging field of UFOlogy, the following database is being compiled and will be available shortly: • MUFON ON-LINE DATABASE: a Research Database containing the complete contents of the MUFON Journal from it's inception to the present (thanks to the efforts of Walter H. Andrus, Jr., International Director, and Systems Analyst and MUFON State Section Director Pete Theer of Lampasas, Texas), will be maintained online for MUFON Members only. This database will be sizeable and categorized into many areas based on the topic of the article or scien- tific paper. Available for use by Field Investigators involv- ed in research of the UFO phenomenon. Also available will be a database of past and current UFO sightings, categorized by state /region /country. All of this enhances your involve- ment in MUFON at no additional cost to the individual member. Overall, the information available through the MufoNet- BBS network is voluminous. While not every Bulletin Board will cover every area, a list of the current topics available include the following: UFOs, the Paranormal, Astronomy, Amateur and Shortwave Radio, Archaeology, Ecology, Geology, Abductions/Contactees, Channelling, World News, Book and Video Reviews, extraterrestrials, animal mutilations, crop circles, Men-In-Black, Alternate Science concepts, Meteorology, Marsface, graphics, Biogra- phies, F.O.I.A. documents, UFO Sightings and sym- posiums/meetings of various MUFON State/Regional groups and other organizations involved in UFOlogy, newsletters from many MUFON state and regional chapters, and non-related subjects such as desk-top publishing, pro- gramming, graphics, database and games. Through the efforts of a number of MUFON members, who volunteer their personal time and funds, all of the above is made possible. Their donations to this endeavor include making available a computer and related hardware and soft- ware specifically for the electronic bulletin board system, accessible around the clock. The members also provide a separate telephone data line and phone number. There is no additional membership charge for these services, as each System-Operator pays their own costs as a service to the members and public in a collective effort to present as much usable information as possible. Worldwide Coverage A s the official computer communications network for MUFON, the MufoNet-BBS Network has been operational for a number of years, with Bulletin Board systems located in many states and provinces within the U.S. and Canada. Australia and New Zealand are linked in, thanks to the efforts of Bob Fletcher, Administrator of AstroNet- BBS Network/Australia. Linkups with other continents should be established in the near future, as the Network grows to access additional avenues of data and communica- tion. We are striving to provide coverage for every state in the U.S. and for all overseas locations, since MUFON is international in structure, and each membership group can reap the benefits of this modern means of communication. The MufoNet-BBS Network also has a communications link with the MUFON Ham-Net through the auspices of Amateur Radio Operator Keith Tarpley. Additionally, for those members without access to a com- puter and modem, a newsletter containing highlights of on- line activities will be available shortly. The MufoNet On- Line Guide has been revised, so those who had requested a copy will receive the new edition.

Does this mean we can now look forward to some- one indexing the Journal's contents on a regular annual basis? Also, the novices and the more computer-illiterate of us out there would probably appreciate some step-by-step instructions as to what to expect when we first log-on to a bulletin board. Many of us get confused when we're asked to enter a password or respond to some other esoteric command and promptly hang-up. Some specific instructions would be helpful, along with recommen- dations of which communications soft- ware to use. I'm on CompuServe myself, but still find it hard to log on to some BBSs and make it through the opening maze. I can see how first-time users often give up in frustration. Also, someone needs to provide a complete listing of all the available ac- cess areas on the various BBS and net- work services that contain UFO and related material, including the Well, MCI (if applicable), Prodigy, different Com- puServe forums and so on.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CONFLICT OR COLLABORATION? The role of political action in resolving the UFO mystery by Fred Whiting, Secretary-Treasurer Fund for UFO Research E arlier this year, a small group of individuals gathered outside the White House to draw attention to the UFO question by conducting a demonstration intended to attract the attention of the press and the policymakers in Washington, DC. Unfortunately, the effort accomplished neither. Billed as \"Operation Right to Know,\" the demonstration was orderly and dignified. According to its organizers, the participants were politely received by members of the public (mostly tourists) with whom they came into contact. However, it failed to do what most demonstrations are in- tended to do: attract publicity and affect public policy. Now, there is a proposal under discussion to conduct a simliar effort in conjunction with the 1993 MUFON UFO Symposium, which will be held in Richmond, VA. I sub- mit that this is inadvisable, for the following reasons: (1) In order for a demonstration to have any effect, it must attract thousands — if not tens of thousands — of participants. The prospective attendance for any MUFON Symposium is 500 to 1,000 people. It is doubtful that each and every participant will be persuaded to travel a hundred miles to Washington, DC, at the height of the tourist season to march around the White House or the U.S. Capitol. (2) Presuming a large contingent can be persuaded to par- ticipate, what will they be demonstrating for (or against)? A call to action which is supported by a sizeable constituency (such as the abortion question, gun control or civil rights) is one thing; however, a call to \"end the UFO cover-up\" is likely to produce nothing but quizzical looks from most Washingtonians. \"What cover-up?\" is the first probable reac- tion; \"What a bunch of cranks!\" is the next. (3) Even assuming the activity generates media coverage (which is unlikely, unless there is violence), what kind of media coverage would it attract? Reporters unfamiliar with the UFO subject will restrict themselves to covering the event, rather than the subject. Participants will be able to convey nothing more than slogans: \"End the cover-up.\" There will be little opportunity to establish why we think there is a cover-up, and what is being covered up, and by whom. (4) Finally, while the intent of the organizers of the pro- spective demonstration is commendable, the consequences of this action might be counterproductive to efforts now taking place to initiate a congressional inquiry into the UFO subject. If you want to use political action to create a positive ef- fect, I suggest that you do the following: • Sit down and write a short personalized business letter to your congressional Representative and/or your Senators. The letter should be typed and free of typographical or gram- matical errors. Keep it to two pages or less. • Explain why you think there is something to be gained from a serious examination of the UFO phenomenon. Don't speculate about what UFOs are, or where they come from, or why they're here. Point to the many thousands of sighting reports by qualified observers, many involving physical traces. If you have a sighting report of your own to convey, describe it. • Be prepared to answer the question, \"What do you want me to do?\" The congressional staffer who receives your letter (and since you're a constituent, it will be answered) needs some guidance. A vague plea that your congressional respresentative \"end the cover-up\" will fall on deaf ears, unless you (a) establish there is a cover-up, and (b) suggest a way he or she can end it. T here is a specific case, and a specific action you can recommend. It involves the Roswell UFO crash case. You know the basic story: an unidentified craft crashed out- side Corona, New Mexico, in July 1947. Unusual debris was recovered. The Roswell Army Air Field announced it had recovered a \"flying disc,\" but the commander of the Eighth Air Force explained it was a weather balloon. However, dozens of witnesses have been identified and have recorded statements on videotape that it was anything but a weather balloon — that the most likely explanation is that it was from outer space. To buttress your letter (a sample of which follows), I sug- gest you enclose either a briefing paper, The Roswell Events, which was prepared for a congressional audience (available from the Fund for UFO Research, P. O. Box 277, Mt. Rainier, MD 20712, for $15.00) and/or the videotape, \"Recollections of Roswell (Part Two)\" (available for $35.00). Ask your Representative or Senator to make a specific inquiry of the appropriate congressional liaison offices, ask- ing for the U.S. government's current official explanation of what was recovered by the Army Air Force in 1947. A multitude of congressional inquiries will provoke questions which are more likely to result in answers. (I would be ex- tremely grateful if you would forward copies of responses you receive; please send them to my attention, in care of the Fund for UFO Research.) There are efforts currently under way to persuade one or more influential committees in the House and the Senate (on a bi-partisan basis) to investigate the Roswell case, and possibly to hold hearings on the subject. A hearing likely will produce more witnesses and more evidence. With your assistance, we have a chance of resolving this 45-year old mystery once and for all. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Sample Letter to Congressional Representatives Hon. U.S. House of Representatives (or Senate) Washington, DC 20515 (or 20510) Dear Rep. (or Sen.)  : As your constituent, I am writing to request a clarifica- tion of the U.S. Government's current position concerning events which occurred in and around Roswell, New Mex- ico, in July 1947. According to newspaper accounts and eyewitness reports, a local rancher, William W. Brazel, discovered pieces of debris from an object which crashed on the property he managed outside Corona, on or about July 2, 1947. He brought some of this material to the attention of Chaves County Sheriff George Wilcox, who called the Roswell Ar- my Air Field. The base Intelligence Officer, Jesse A. Marcel, and a Counter Intelligence Corps Officer, Sheridan Cavitt, went to the ranch to inspect the material. They discovered a great deal of lightweight debris which couldn't be cut, burned, or even dented with a sledgeham- mer. On orders from the base commander, Col. William Blanchard, the Public Information Officer, Walter G. Haul, issued a news release that the Amry Air Force had recovered a \"flying disc.\" Some of the debris was flown to Fort Worth, Texas where the Commander of the Eighth Air Force, Gen. Roger Ramey, identified the material for the press as the remains of a weather balloon and its radar target. However, subsequent investigation has raised considerable doubt about the weather balloon explanation. For example: • According to his son and neighbors, Brazel was held incommunicado by officials at the Roswell base for nearly a week, questioned extensively and ordered not to say anything about his experience; however, in a newspaper in- terview, he said that the material he recovered \"did not in any way resemble a weather balloon,\" many of which he had recovered on his property. • Sheriff Wilcox, to whom Brazel initially reported find- ing the debris, also was ordered by the military not to say anything, but members of his family say that not only did he see debris at the crash site — he also saw four \"space\" beings,\" one of whom was alive. Moreover, his grand- daughter, Barbara Dugger, was told by her grandmother, Inez Wilcox, that the entire family was threatened with death by the military if they discussed the incident. • The former manager of KGFL Radio in Roswell, Jud Roberts, says the station was threatened with loss of its license by government officials in Washington, DC, if it broadcast the story about the \"flying saucer.\" In addition, according to Lydia Sleppy, a secretary at KOAT Radio in Albuquerque, a wire transmission of the news story on the event was interrupted by a message something like: \"CEASE TRANSMISSION. NATIONAL SECURITY ITEM.\" • According to Brig. Gen. Thomas J. DuBose (USAF, ret.), who was Gen. Ramey's Chief of Staff, Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, the Deputy and Acting Commander, Strategic Air Command, at Andrews Army Air Field, ordered that some of the debris recovered on the ranch be brought directly to him in Washington. Gen. DuBose says officials at the Headquarters of the Eighth Air Force were directed to tell the press that the material was from a weather balloon radar target, and that the weather balloon explana- tion was a \"cover story\" to divert the attention of the press. • The pilot who transported some of the wreckage, Oliver W. Henderson, said he saw the bodies of alien beings at the Roswell base, according to his widow, Sappho Henderson, his daughter, Mary Kathryn Groode, and his friend, John Kromschroeder. • A mortician who worked for the funeral home in Roswell, Glenn Dennis, says an Army nurse friend told him about participating in the autopsies of three alien bodies at the base. Therefore, I am formally requesting that you seek to deter- mine whether the highly unusual material recovered near Corona was from a \"flying disc,\" a weather balloon, or something else. Please advise me, at your earliest opportunity, of the United States Government's current position on the nature of the material recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947, and its current explanation for all official actions taken with respect to this event.

The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Program (SETI) will employ radio telescopes and computers seek- ing to decipher signals from some other planet very much like our own. It is based on the now widely-accepted scien- tific premise that out of the billions of stars in our own galaxy, there is a mathematical probability that some may have planets on which intelligent civilizations have evolved. And yet, if the evidence we have presented today as scien- tists and researchers from several countries at the Symposium on Outer Intelligence and Human Future at the UN, at the invitation of the Parapsychology Society of the UNSRC, is to be taken seriously, there is every indication that intelligent life forms already have made contact with citizens of Planet Earth. In other words, we are in the position of the man who is unsuccessfully trying to contact his neighbor on the telephone, because his neighbor is knocking at the door. We support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, however, we believe that the search can, and must, begin at the UN. We are now faced with one of the most important issues of the century: the scientific study of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). The resolution of this enigma will affect the future of the majority of the inhabitants living on this planet. The UFO problem touches the lives of many nations and engenders puzzlement, fear, and, at times, harm. Therefore, it is of significant scientific and technological interest, and it carries with it many implications of the existence of an intelligence other than our own. The evidence is both intriguing and challenging. Reports on UFO activity describe incidents where the craft fly circles around high performance jet aircraft, shut down sophisticated electronic systems, black out electrical power systems, stop automobiles, upset animals, damage plants, and cause material injuries to humans. We now have the data to prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that Unidentified Flying Objects are operating in our skies on a regular and uninterrupted basis. The technology demonstrated by the UFOs is futuristic, beyond the present capability of human technology. Without warning, UFOs appear and confuse the lives of humans throughout the world. We, as world citizens, should no longer stand idly by and allow this to continue without a serious and united ef- fort to address the issue. Therefore, we urge the United Nations to implement its Decision GA 33/426 of December 18, 1978, by establishing an agency of the UN for undertaking, coordinating, and disseminating the results of research into unidentified fly- ing objects and related phenomena. A small unit for the purpose is a good start considering the present UN finan- cial situation. When the first contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence is openly made, the question will be asked: \"Who speaks for the citizens of Planet Earth?\" and the answer must be, \"We, the United Nations.\" Sincerely, Dr. Norma Milanovich Dr. Rauni-Luukanen-Kilde, M.D. Ms. Linda Mouton-Howe Mr. Stanton Friedman Mr. John Schuessler JOHN F.

And such is certainly the case with Jacques Vallee's Forbidden Science from North Atlantic Books, a virtual day-by-day re- counting of Vallee's involvement with the UFO phenomenon, beginning as a young man in Pointose, France, on Christmas Eve, 1957, on the eve of his father's death, and continuing until Saturday, December 13, 1969, shortly before the Air Force announced the official discontinuation of Project Blue Book. I found myself reading it in great gulps, partly because of my interest in Vallee's thought patterns and progression, partly because Forbidden Science spans some of the same times and places that figured in my own formative years. Vietnam shaped much of my own adult perceptions about the relationship of government to the governed and I had also been an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin, albeit shortly after Vallee had already abandoned Texas to join astronomer Dr. J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Both figure prominently in Vallee's early reminiscences. If you weren't there, in other words, you may not be quite as fascinated with Vallee's first-person account of times past as I was. But if you have any interest at all in the history of the UFO phenomenon, then Vallee's diary makes for first- rate, must reading. The story that emerges is almost heart-rending, a poig- nant pastiche, as far as UFOs are concerned, of flubbed fate and personal character flaws. Never mind that Vallee himself rarely makes a false misstep; this is, after all, his diary. Anyone wanting to come up with a counter viewpoint will have to submit their own personal journals for publication. For the moment, Vallee's intelligent, far-ranging account rules the roost by virtue of being the first and only diary of a ma- jor participant in print. At 466 pages, with photos, notes and index, it's also a big, sprawling book and a bargain at $24.95. There are a few new revelations for the record, such as how Hynek was carried on the government payrolls, but for the most part, Forbidden Science is the retelling of one missed opportunity after another. And some historic personages emerge as all too human, including the late Hynek and Dr. James McDonald of the University of Arizona. The former is described as increasingly distracted by the media spotlight, the latter as too tightly wound for his own good, as evidenc- ed by his subsequent suicide. Several of Vallee's French and other European colleagues also emerge in thumb-nail por- traits, although all the major players remain essentially neutered in the fece of scientific indifference and governmental intrigue. Try as all the protagonists might, the rock of Sisyphus represented by UFOs just won't roll, at least not uphill. Naturally, one is afforded a good glimpse into Vallee's own interior mindset. Adherents will be able to recognize the gestation of several early themes and follow them through to their current conclusions and expression. Critics may not be mollified, but Vallee is obviously not overly concerned with how he is seen and judged by the contemporary UFO community. By virtue of the failed French experience in Viet Nam, for example, Vallee could easily foresee the folly of American involvement in the jungles of southeast Asia. This theme of the advantage of the outsider crops up in several other areas in Forbidden Science, including both computers and UFOs. Originally intending to be an astronomer, Vallee even- tually recognizes the importance of computers and turns to the fledgling technology long before it would become a household word and commonplace desktop appliance. But he also suffers the frustration of knowing firsthand what others don't or refuse to recognize — that computers are the obvious wave of the future. In the Valley of the Blind, the one-eyed man is supposed to be king, but royalty can sometimes be a lead crown when you have to wait around, spinning your wheels, for society and science to catch up. V allee obviously feels much the same way about modern UFO studies. Although the consumate insider of American ufology, he's also been ignored by much of the mainstream of the field, and increasingly cast in recent years as a solitary outsider. Part of the situation is no doubt due to a perceived arrogance on Vallee's part; but it's hard for anyone to suffer fools gladly, and surely ufology has its share of the latter. On the other hand, Vallee is an outsider as far as most Americans are concerned. He's certainly more well- educated than the average ufologist, more widely read, travel- ed and experienced in a number of fields, and of course he's \"been there\" in ways most of us can merely imagine. From Vallee's point of view, many ufologists must still seem mired in the days of punch-cards before the coming of the per- sonal computer. In a way, it's no surprise that he's either been largely misunderstood or ignored. Forbidden Science may or may not bring you around to Vallee's way of thinking, but it should go a long way toward explaining why he thinks the way he does. Recommended reading in any case. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Far-Out! Edited by Michael DiGregorio and William L. Moore, published quarterly by L.F.P., Inc. 72 pp., $3.95 T he country may be in a recession, but interest in UFOs and related matters is apparently at an all-time high, which explains the first issue of an ambitious new news- stand magazine, Far-Out!, one editor of which is longtime ufologist Bill Moore. Most of the other contributors I am not familiar with, but presumably they make up a coterie of West Coast writers and researchers with an interest in the odd and unusual (or as the subtitle has it: \"The unex- plainable, the unusual and the unreal\"). This first 72-page issue, dated Fall 1992, is an eclectic mix of short and feature articles spanning 72 pages and featuring both color covers and interior photographs, rather nicely laid out by art director/designer Lew Bryant. I have no idea what kind of distribution Far-Out! is going to get at this stage, but interested parties can write the publisher for subscription or single-copy information at 9171 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 300, Beverly Hills, CA 90210. Interior contents are divided into several sections which will presumably become regular departments. These include Secrets & Mysteries, Unknown Territory, Vault of Know- ledge (book reviews) and Truly Bizarre. The highlight of the premiere issue, in my opinion, is \"High Strangeness in the High Country\" by Michael DeGregorio, an overview of UFO-like events in and around Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, which is worth the price of admission alone. Some turns of phrase are overly cute a la the Vanity Fair school of new journalism (to coin a cliche myself), but in the main, the writing is vigorous, detailed and at least somewhat slanted in the direction of objectivity rather than a mere recitation of local rumors and airborne wonders. Like most of the other material in Far-Out!, the article is also well-illustrated. William Moore contributes several articles, including a lengthy piece on the late T. Townsend Brown (\"The Wizard of Anti-Gravity\"), a shorter one on whether or not President Eisenhower, as rumored, once met with alien beings from outer space (unlikely), and, I suspect, the majority of the unsigned book reviews. There are other articles on ghost lights, mystery trains and bog monsters, along with an interview of Nick Men- za, the drummer of the heavy metal group Megadeath, about the band's MTV video of one of their songs, \"Hangar 18.\" (I said the contents were West Coast eclectic, didn't I?) All in all, Far-Out! is a fine first effort which bears watching. HUFON Report The HUFON Report is the apparently monthly newsletter of the Houston UFO Network, Inc., and as such is one of the better amateur newsletters around, although I've only seen the 12-page October 1992 issue, cover-priced at $1.50. (For additional information, write HUFON at P. O. Box 942, Bellaire, TX 77402-0942 or call 713-850-1352.) Put together by David Mayo and Vince Johnson, the Report appears to be a nice mixture of current news events and cases, along with announcements of upcoming speakers. In this issue,' for example, there is a good report by HUFON's Andy Ambercrombie of a personal visit to Gulf Breeze that coin- cided with Dr. Steven Greer's efforts to make contact with the Florida UFO(s) jocularly referred to as \"Bubba.\" Amber- crombie's report is straight-forward and refreshingly free of both dogma and jargon. Michael Corbin, the system operator of the Paranet Information Service, a computer- ized BBS, offers a review and update of the Linda \"Cor- tile\" abduction case as presented by Budd Hopkins at the Albuquerque MUFON symposium. Anyone living in the Houston or immediate Gulf Coast area would be well- advised to check into this nicely produced and informative newsletter. Bulletin of Anomalous Experience This unique publication is probably best described in the words of its editor, David Gotlib, M.D., of Toronto: \"Bulletin of Anomalous Experience is a networking newslet- ter about the UFO abduction phenomenon and related issues, for mental health professionals and interested scientists. As Hilary Evans has observed, we try to 'comfortably tread the narrow path between the groves of academia and the dust and heat of the marketplace, inquiring and suggesting, not asserting or insisting.' Distribution has traditionally been limited to mental health professionals and interested scien- tists. We have recently decided to open up subscriptions to experiences as well, on a trial basis (as discussed in the results of a recent Virtual Conference).\" If you're familiar with the computerized bulletin board format, you should enjoy BAE, which is basically a hard copy print-out of same, with feature articles and several on- going \"on-line\" discussions or dialogs. The most recent issue (Vol. 3, No. 5, October 1992, 12pp) contains comments by Barbara Becker and David Ritchey, Ph.D., a piece by this reviewer on alien abduction and human abortions, a feature article by Richard Boylan, Ph.D., the latest news from Michael Persinger, excerpts from David Hufford's The Ter- ror That Comes in the Night, and selected abstracts of scien- tific papers of potential interest to abductionologists.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"News'N'Views Channeler Goes To Court A ccording to a front-page story in the New York Times (Sept. 25, 1992), the most successful New Age chan- neler of her generation, J. Z. Knight, has been hauled into a Washington state court by her fifth husband, Jeffrey Knight, who is seeking to overturn a 1989 divorce settlement. Mr. Knight claims he was bullied into the meager settlement by his belief in Ramtha, the 35,000-year-old Cro- Magnon warrior who reportedly speaks in a gutteral growl through his wife. Ramtha first appeared 17 years ago in Ms. Knight's Tacoma kitchen. Since then he has become the most lucrative spirit voice of all time. \"Ramster\" groupies like Shirley MacLaine and Linda Evans reportedly paid as much as $1000 per session to be present when Ramtha was being channeled, according to court testimony. Nancy Barr-Brandon, age 50, said that she spent some $100,000 over the course of eight years before she finally decided that Ms. Knight was a fraud. The money went to the Ramtha School of Enlightenment in Yelm, Washington, where Ms. Knight maintains a palatial estate on a 50-acre ranch, for books, tapes and survival gear. Mr. Knight maintains that he and his wife pulled in as much as $4 million a year from Ramtha's teachings. Many followers have moved to the Pacific Northwest area because, according to the channeler, it's reportedly a safe haven from natural disasters and/or alien invaders. (In- terestingly, The Leading Edge, which promotes its own brand of paranoia-laced ufology, is also headquartered in Yelm, 55 miles south of Seattle. The connection would seem to be more than geographically coincidental.) Mr. Knight is now asking for his fair share of the millions, saying he was bullied .into accepting a lesser offer by Ram- tha. He says he also suffers from the virus that causes AIDS, and claims he deprived himself of needed help because the Cro-Magnon spirit was scornful of contemporary medicine. F or the better part of the last decade, he admits, he was under Ramtha's influence. \"I trusted him implicitly,\" he testified in court. \"He was all-knowing and omnipresent.\" Mr. Knight said he also believed Ramtha would heal him from AIDS. According to the Times' account, \"He no longer believes in Ramtha and says that 'mind-control techniques' form the major part of the teachings.\" A spokesperson for Ms. MacLaine said she had \"moved on to other explora- tions.\" For reasons unfathomable to this writer, the channeling of so-called extraterrestrial intelligences has recently become a rave \"item\" among some fringes of ufology, despite com- mon sense evidence that the information so received is often contradictory, couched in spiritual generalities at best, or in incomprehensible gobbledegook at worst. It might be well in regard to alleged alien channeling to consider the words of Catholic thinker G. K. Chesterton, writing shortly after the turn of the century following his own experiments in spiritualism and mediumship: \"I saw quite enough of the thing to be able to testify, with complete certainty, that something happens which is not in the ordinary sense natural, or produced by the normal and conscious human will. Whether it is produced by some sub- conscious but still human force, or by some powers, good, bad or indifferent, which are external to humanity, I would not attempt to decide. The only thing I will say with com- plete confidence, about that mystic and invisible power, is that it tells lies.\" (Quoted in Colin Wilson's Mysteries, p. 561.) Can't Keep Secrets? O n September 18 of this year, the Defense Department declassified the existence of a National Reconnaisance Office which had been in charge of gathering foreign in- telligence by spy satellites and other airborne technology. During the agency's 30-year existence, it had never been previously acknowledged by the United States. Ten days later, the Department of Energy announced a second round of declassification regarding the workings of the hydrogen bomb. An earlier round had been conducted in 1990. Dr. Ray E. Kidder, senior physicist at the Lawrence Liver- more National Laboratory in California who helped pioneer hydrogen bomb technology, was quoted by the New York Times (Sept. 28) as saying \"It's a landmark. In view of the fact that this material has been withheld for so long, and that so many people for perfectly sound reasons wanted to have it declassified, it's very important.\" Reportedly the release of the previously highly-guarded material has been held up by election-year politics. It is ap- parently being released now because of its relevance to nuclear fusion energy systems. Besides, said an anonymous DOE official, \"half the world is publishing this material ... The benefit for us in declassification is what we stand to gain in terms of international cooperation.\" A week earlier, the CIA announced that it would review and declassify many of its previously secret documents per- taining to the recruitment of Nazi war criminals in the wake of WWII. A move is also afoot in Congress to make public many or all of the secret files relating to the 1992 assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Which raises the question: What about the still-secret UFO files? MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON Names New Deputy Director of Investigations Jerold R.

Ron Johnson is also a member of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (since 1979), V.I.S.I.T. (since 1990), a con- tributor to the Fund for UFO Research (since 1988), past member of A.P.R.O. (1969-1988), DATA-NET (1967-1973), and a subscriber to several foreign and domestic publica- tions devoted to the flying saucer enigma. Ron's lifelong interest and research began in 1963 when he discovered the \"classical literature of flying saucers,\" reading such authors as Donald Keyhoe, M. K. Jessup, Harold T. Wilkins, Ed Ruppelt and Frank Edwards. By 1965, he was meeting with school buddies on weekends for a \"fly- ing saucer discussion group,\" following new reports of the emerging South and North American \"wave\" of 1965-66. Already licensed as a radio amateur, Ron constructed a home station and antennas to communicate regularly with other amateurs who had founded the DATA-NET organization, which held weekly worldwide radio meetings and published a quality monthly newsletter (the DATA-NET Report) from 1966 to 1973. This amateur radio involvement with flying saucer reporting and discussion has continued under the ban- ner of MUFON, which incorporated the \"network\" con- cept of information gathering and dissemination, and \"WA5RON\" is still heard regularly on the air, encouraging serious and always fact-based discussions of the phenomenon and its exposure in the public media. Ron has collected, over the years, a fair-sized library of historic and modern research materials on the flying saucer subject. Ron Johnson recognized through personal investigations in the 1970s that the phenomenon was more than just some aerial objects which required application of the physical sciences toward detection and analysis, but a subtle and per- vasive intelligence that interacts with certain individual and family groups, while leaving many others (like himself) com- pletely alone and understandably skeptical. He feels any at- tempt at understanding the phenomenon will require a multidisciplinary approach and careful attention to the witnesses themselves: the \"human factor\" that acts as a distorting medium between the phenomenon and the researcher.

Gribble Western Regional Director • Log #921504W: At about 10:55 p.m. on April 15, 1992, a 20-year-old male witness was standing in his front yard at Aloha, Oregon when he noticed a bright blue object which appeared to be approaching him; investigator John Kirby. He said that the object appeared to be solid, hemispherical (domed top with a flat bottom) with blurred edges. After approximately four to five seconds, the object stopped for about two seconds, at which time its color turned from bright blue to bright red. The object then began accelerating rapidly toward the west and disappeared into clouds. Total sighting time was estimated to be about 40 seconds. • Log #922404W: About 9:30 p.m. on April 24, 1992, a retired geophysicist and his three grown sons observed dozens of maneuvering lights, while camping out at the Fish Springs Wildlife Refuge south of Dugway Proving Grounds, a secret government installation in western Utah; investigator Mildred Biesele. At first they appeared in the southern sky moving westward, but soon they were seen in all parts of the sky, as many as 10 or 12 at a time, some singly, some in sets of two or three in vertical, horizontal or triangular formations. Star-like in size and brightness, some were red, some white. One set of three lights moved behind a peak on the horizon in a vertical line and emerged on the other side as a triangle. The aerial display continued for nearly two hours. • Log #911003W: A male adult living in Citrus Heights, California observed an object in the shape of an equilateral triangle passing directly overhead at about 10:30 p.m. on or about March 10, 1991; investigator John G: Maylone. The object made no noise and had no lights, being illuminated by ground lights. The object appeared to be light gray in color and had a circular-shape at each apex. The witness estimated the altitude at 2000-5000 feet and the speed at 100-150 mph. Estimated diameter 200 feet. The triangle was in sight for about 10 seconds. • Log #912911W: While viewing the night sky over Larkspur, California on November 29, 1991, a 35-year-old male witnessed a strange phenomenon; investigator Virgil C. Staff. As the man's eyes adjusted to the darkness, about 11 p.m., he noticed a jagged circular configuration of lights in the distance. After watching for about seven minutes, the circle appeared to be approaching him. Some \"stick-like shapes of light... appeared to drop down\" from the circle as it drew closer. These sticks were fashioned together and connected into a five or six-sided pattern that appeared to drop towards the ground. One of the stick patterns was pale red, and the other was pale green. As the circle ap- proached the witness it took on the appearance of a star- fish. The starfish remained for approximately three minutes, after which the witness went indoors.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"AN OPEN LETTER TO UFO INVESTIGATORS by J. Howard, J.D. Y ou, as UFO investigators, are generally intelligent, deductive and enthusiastic. Sometimes, though, in your eagerness to gather information, you inadver- tently trample on those who provide it. It is my hope, and the purpose of this article, that by telling you how I, as an abductee, feel and what I need from you, I might help you deal with more sensitivity and a better understanding of those you investigate. I speak only for myself, but there may be others who have had similar experiences. After a seven month investigation of my abduction ex- periences, I felt I was ready to do more than contribute my little bits and pieces to the cosmic puzzle. I wanted to spread my wings, to meet people, to learn about the larger picture. With great reservation, my investigator finally relented and gave me his blessing to attend a symposium on UFOs. He expressed several strong warnings, however, about the ad- visability of talking about my experiences, none of which I took seriously. Experience is truly the best teacher, and for some of us hard-headed individualists, it is often the only way we learn. At the symposium, I needed only to voice an opinion about our inability to understand what they were here for, and every investigator in the workshop immediately assumed that I was an abductee. Suddenly, I became several things I am not, i.e. an authority, a victim, and a person greatly in need of advice. I feel an obligation to share as much as I can. After all, we are in this to find out what we can about the phenomenon, and I am willing to do my part. Everyone seems to have a theory about them, what they are here for, what they are doing, where they come from, etc. What surprised me is that everybody seemed to think that I have one too. I don't. I know very little about them except what I've experienced myself, and that leaves me extremely ill-prepared to make any kind of judgment about the whole picture. I've seen quite a few things. I understand almost none of them. The few responses I've gotten from them have more to do with my immediate situation than with a discourse on the social mores and universal goals of extraterrestrial intellects. Speculation can be useful in revealing information you may not realize you have, but relying on speculation as truth is dangerous. The distinction between what is speculation J. Howard is a sculptor, attorney and abductee living in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \"What if we decide we want to end the encounters, we try everything we, or you, can think of, and it all fails?\" and what we know as truth has to be clear both in how the question is asked and in the use of the answer. Perhaps my pet peeve is being asked, \"Why do I let them do this to me?\" Or \"Why don't I fight them?\" The question reminds me of the research I did in college with Japanese quail. We tested their ability to distinguish between different colors and shapes. Only certain of the quail were usable in our research, as many of them couldn't take the confine- ment. They jumped up and down in the cage until they literal- ly bashed their brains out. W e didn't intend to hurt them, but they fought until they killed themselves. They didn't know what they were fighting or how best to fight it, or even if they really needed to fight it at all. But their first reaction was to fight, and it cost them dearly. I like to think of myself as being smarter than the quail. The alien abduction experience is, on one level, quite fascinating. It still leaves me feeling vulnerable, however, and questioning who and what I am, and if I have choices I'm not exercising. I don't know enough to decide whether or not I want to fight them, or how best to fight them and still preserve myself. If my memories are of real things, I have tried to resist them in my own way, and the results have not been particularly ego enhancing. I find the whole ex- perience to be generally more interesting than traumatic, and until I know more about it, I'd rather make no decision than to make the wrong one. To assume that every abductee wants or needs to end the experience, or that any of us are actually capable of doing so is naive and dangerous. What if we decide we want to end the encounters, we try everything we, or you, can think of, and it all fails? Personally, I have no desire to experience the kind of desperation that such a discovery might cause. What I definitely don't need are hasty judg- ments about what I should or shouldn't do with regard to the experiences I am having. The way you ask your questions can make me feel more like a victim than the experience itself. I don't think of myself as a victim, so don't treat me like one. Be sensitive in your approach, but don't coddle me. Be willing to let me call the shots as to how long the interview goes on or what we talk about. Mine is not a criminal investigation, so you don't have the right to judge me. I'm not a possession; don't try to tell me who I can and can't talk to. T his is where I'm coming from. Abductees as a group are probably ultra-sensitive, and I'm no exception. I get enough ridicule and misunderstanding from the outside Continued on page 22 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Letters W hile I believe that cooperation and confrontation are not mutally exclusive of each other, I would not want to presuppose that the United States government is, in fact, willing to sit down at the conference room table to discuss UFOs. It is now 1992 and, after 45 years of patient waiting on behalf of civilian UFO organizations, there is no evidence to suggest that this can or will occur. Could civilian UFO organizations strike a \"better deal\" by replacing the con- ference table with a bargaining table? I think not! Frankly, the United States government could have issued a forthright narrative as early as 1948 to the American public relative to the extraordinary events that occurred the year before in New Mexico inclusive of alien hieroglyphics, alien propulsion systems, and the recovery of alien bodies and craft. Instead, the United States government positioned itself with a policy of nondisclosure vis a vis the National Security Act of 1947. This policy of nondisclosure, in effect, created a seizure of a property right which the United States govern- ment never developed or owned in the first place. Because the United States government received the gift of alien technology through a fortuitous set of circumstances, Jour- nal readers will want to ask themselves how long the exclu- sion in sharing the property right will last. Does the seized right continue ad infinitum because \"crack American scien- tists have failed to completely \"reverse engineer\" UFOs after 45 years? Kudos to the nine men and women who demonstrated in front of the White House to end the policy of nondisclosure. Maybe the time has come for the membership of MUFON to organize a massive rally in the Spring of 1993 in Washington, D.C., to address the exact concerns enunciated by those in the first public demonstration. I am certain that there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who share in the belief that the United States government cannot con- tinue its course of nondisclosure for another 45 years. Additionally, because UFO researchers are constantly seeking \"hard evidence,\" I would like the membership of MUFON to consider a scenario of creative confrontation, including the establishment next year of an escrow account in the amount of $1,000,000.00 (one million dollars) for the sole purpose of acting as a reward to secure the alleged photos and/or movies of the Roswell crash or any other known landing, such as the Holloman Air Force Base inci- dent (1964). Notice of the reward with its attendant details could be published daily, or as required, in a national newspaper such as USA Today. Notwithstanding the hard liners within the MJ-12 group (or its functional and real equivalent), I am certain that some- one will walk out of the woodwork with the evidence that is needed. I will make a personal contribution in the amount of $100,000.00 to the escrow account. Further, MUFON has the requisite expertise to ferret out the hoaxers and tricksters while at the same time authenticating genuine submittals. We'll let the lawyers sift through the legal implications of a possible breach in the national security as per the National Security Act. After all, no one wants all 4,000 members to be charged with acts of treason against the state. — Robert M.

Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies in Chicago, and he is the author of The UFO Encyclopedia, a multi-volume compilation of data about the UFO phenomenon, the first volume of which was published in 1990 (Apogee Books, Detroit, MI); the second volume was published in 1992; and the third volume is forthcoming. \"In IUR, Jerry has presented the pros and cons of highly controversial information in a fair and evenhanded manner, and he has editorialized articulately and effectively on the foibles of UFO skeptics,\" according to Richard Hall, a member of the Fund's National Board of Directors. \"He has also been a pioneer in analysis of 'contactee' and 'abducteee' reports and in examination of the 1896-97 U.S. airship mystery. He has been a voice of reason for several decades and an important contributor to the scientific literature of UFOs,\" Hall said. Isabel Davis was a pioneer in the field of UFOlogy. She was a co-founder of one of the first scientific UFO organiza- tions and she helped form the Fund for UFO Research in 1977. She passed on in 1984. Nominations for the Isabel Davis Award are made by the Fund's Board of Directors, and the recipient is chosen by the Fund's donors, who contributed more than $1,000 to sup- port the 1992 award.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb December 1992 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.2) glows brightly in the SW, not setting now until about 7:30 in mid-December. In the latter half of the month, much fainter Saturn lies within at least 5° of our radiant neighbor world, finally closing to 1° or so on the 21st. The lunar crescent is near the pair on December 27. Mars, retrograding below the Twin Stars (Pollux and Castor) in Gemini, brightens still further during the month, from -0.7 to -1.4. Rising in the NE about 7:30 p.m. on the 1st and 4:45 on the 31st, the little red planet nears its closest approach to Earth early in January. Thus, telescope-users should begin observing Mars now. It is spring in the northern hemisphere of the planet, and the north polar cap should be conspicuous. Look carefully for dark contrasts amid the ocher-tinted deserts. The dark regions are now known to represent a differing gradation of surface dust in those areas — not vegetation. The sec- ond of three conjunctions in a row between Mars and Pollux occurs on the 22nd when the red planet passes 3° below the star. Saturn (0.7), in Capricornus, lies low in the SSW at dusk and sets in the WSW about 8 p.m. in midmonth. See Venus above. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars advances to the W by dawn. Jupiter (-1.9), in Virgo, rises in the E about 1 AM in mid- December and moves to the S by dawn. Total Lunar Eclipse: The full moon slides into the Earth's shadow on December 9. Observers in the northeastern quarter of the U.S. are favored for this eclipse, since the Moon remains above the horizon during the entire event. In the central U.S., the Moon rises partially eclipsed, and farther west it rises either already in total eclipse or after totality is over. (The post-totality situation takes place in California, Oregon, and SW Alaska.) Our satellite enters the dark umbral shadow at 4:59 PM EST, remains totally eclipsed from 6:07 to 7:22, and emerges completely from the umbra at 8:29. On the 23rd, SW Alaska watchers will see the new moon begin to take a \"bite\" out of the Sun at 3:11 PM. However, the Sun sets a short time later before maximum eclipse (35% of the Sun's diameter covered) occurs. • Meteor Shower: A gibbous Moon unfortunately interferes most of the night at the Geminid meteors peak on the morning of December 13. With no Moon, the hourly rate might have been 50 or more meteors. The Geminids are medium-speed ob- jects of mostly white color with short paths. Some of them also are visible from the 7th to the 15th. The mostly faint Ursids, emanating from Ursa Minor (\"Little Dipper\"), peak on the 22nd. Although theoretical- ly visible all night, this shower is best toward dawn when 15 to 20 meteors per hour might be detected. Some of the shower members can be seen from about December 17 to 24. • Moon Phases: First quarter — December 2 Full moon — December 9 Last quarter — December 16 New Moon — December 23 First quarter — December 31 • The Stars: By now in midevening, the summer stars have almost com- pletely disappeared in the NW; the autumn stars are past the meridian in the W and SW; and the bright luminaries of the Winter Circle occupy the E and SE heavens. (The reddish interloper in the Circle is Mars.) Within the Winter Circle stands mighty Orion. Below the great warrior's trio of belt stars, observe a fuzzy \"star\" in his sword. It is the Great Nebula of Orion, a luminous cloud of gas and dust — a cosmic nursery for newborn stars. Beware of that IFO culprit Sirius, which rises in the ESE at 8 PM in midmonth. INVESTIGATORS, Continuted world, sometimes even from loved ones, if I venture forth and tell about my experiences. From you in the UFO com- munity, I need compassion, sensitivity and concern. You can also give me a reality base that often gets lost when deal- ing with something so far outside the realm of normal human experience. Help me. Give me an outlet for my need to talk about what has happened. Provide an understanding shoulder to cry on when I need that. I have been accosted, probed, ex- amined and generally harassed by them. I need better than that from you. © 7992 J. Howard MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 295 November 1992"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued are: Deems E.

International UFO Museum The new International UFO Museum and Research Center has opened its doors to visitors at 400 North Main Street in Roswell, New Mexico. It will house various displays of UFO material and allied subjects. Featured in the museum are 80 feet of freestanding panels containing visual material depicting many aspects of UFOs. In addition, there are many video tapes related to UFOs that will be shown upon re- quest to visitors in comfortable surroundings. Two of the founders of the nonprofit, tax-exempt corporation were prin- cipals in the famous 1947 Roswell UFO crash recovery — Walter G. Haut (P.I.O.) and Glenn Dennis (mortician); President and Vice President, respectively. Max Littell is Secretary-Treasurer. They invite visitors in Roswell to stop by and visit with them at the museum, where there is no admission charge. Walt and Jeanne Andrus participated in the official opening day on Saturday, October 24, 1992. For membership information, please write to PO. Box 2221, Roswell, NM 88202. MUFON donated a complete set of the annual MUFON International UFO Symposium Proceedings from 1975 through 1992 to the International UFO Museum for reference purposes, matching the contribution to the original Roswell UFO Engima Museum at 6010 South Main. Located adja- cent to the main gate at the old Roswell Army Air Field (Walker AFB), John and Sharon Price invite you to visit their museum featuring a beautiful life-like panoramic display of the Roswell crash and recovery at the Plains of San Agustin, as related by Grady L. \"Barney\" Barnett and other witnesses. Regional UFO Conferences In addition to the Annual MUFON International UFO Symposia, regional UFO conferences are conducted throughout the United States and Canada that are supported by MUFON and announced in the MUFON UFO Journal \"Calendar of UFO Conferences for 1993.\" All conference organizers should advise MUFON at least two months, preferably three, in advance, with information on date, time, place, etc., in order to list their announcement in the calendar. On Saturday, November 14, 1992, MUFON-Maryland conducted a one-day symposium in the town of Northeast, MD, organized by State Director, Bruce S. Maccabee and hosted by George Reynolds, Sr. of Elkton, MD. Speakers, in addition to Bruce Maccabee and George Reynolds, were Don Berliner, Bob Oechsler and Vince DePietro. Since Dr. Maccabee did not give MUFON adequate lead time for the announcement in the calendar, obviously, it is not listed. Conversely, the First Delaware UFO Symposium on November 21, 1992, in Wilmington, DE, hosted by State Director, Hugh B. Horning, does appear. Even though MUFON may not officially support par- ticular UFO converences, we invite conference organizers to submite their vital information for entry in the calendar as a service to Journal readers so they may attend events in their region of the nation. MUFON 1993 UFO Symposium \"Ufology: The Emergence of a New Science\" is the theme for the MUFON 1993 International UFO Symposium to be held July 2, 3 and 4 at the Hyatt Richmond Hotel in Rich- mond, Virginia. Speakers already scheduled are John E. Mack, M.D., Wesley E. Ellison, Illobrand von Ludwiger (Germany), Jeffrey W. Sainio, Vincent-Juan Ballester Ounos (Spain) and Colin Andrews. Please mark your calen- dar now and possibly plan your family vacation to join your UFO friends and colleagues in Richmond in July.

The following people were elected to the Board: Jerold R. \"Ron\" Johnson (Austin, TX), Deputy Direc- tor, Investigations; Larry W. Bryant (Alexandria, VA), Director of Governmental Affairs; Irena Scott, Ph.D. (Galena, OH), Director of Publications; and John E. Mack, M.D. (Chestnut Hill, MA), Director at Large (Psychiatry). We are very proud to welcome these distinguished members to the MUFON Board. In subsequent issues of the Jour- nal, a photograph and biography of each will be published so that everyone may become better acquainted with these talented individuals. This issue is devoted to Jerold R. \"Ron\" Johnson, the new Deputy Director, Investigations, who replaced Dan Wright when Dan resigned in April 1992. Computerization of Reports When Dan Wright volunteered to transcribe abduction audio tapes for researchers in this field and enter them into a computer, he relinquished the project for computerization of UFO sighting reports. A recently retired engineer from IBM in Austin, TX, T. David Spencer, has volunteered to head up this vitally important program, assisted by Forest Crawford (Collinsville, IL). Mr. Wright delivered the cur- rent UFO file to Walt Andrus in Springfield, MO, who in turn transferred the file to Mr. Spencer the following week in Austin. State and Provincial Directors should continue to send copies of their completed reports to their respective Regional Directors and Canadian National Director for processing with the original copy to MUFON headquarters in Seguin. After preparing a brief narrative account of the significant sightings received each month for the MUFON UFO Jour- nal \"Current Case Log,\" the Regional Directors will mail their copies to Jerold R. Johnson, 12700 Silver Creek, Austin, TX 78727. Mr. Johnson will review the reports, mak- ing sure that the Computer Input Form 2 is attached, before giving them to David Spencer in Austin. Central Regional Director Election Due to personal health reasons, George R. Coyne will not seek a second four-year term as the Central Regional Director for 1993. The central region is composed of the following states: MI, OH, KY, TN, AL, MS, IN, IL, WI, MN, IA, MO, AR, LA, TX, OK, KS, NE, SD and ND. This is an elected office to the MUFON Board of Directors by all of the members living in the designated states through a ballot enclosed with the MUFON UFO Journal prior to the election. Anyone is eligible to be a candidate for this prestigious position, however, only State or Assistant State Directors may officially nominate candidates. If you are in- terested in being a candidate, please write to your State Direc- tor, expressing your desire and include a resume of your qualifications by December 31, 1992. The election will be held in early 1993. This is an opportunity for present state leaders to fulfill greater responsibilities within MUFON. New Officers The breakup of the U.S.S.R. into the Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.) has necessitated a MUFON reorganization within this area of the world. Vladimir V. Rubtsov, Ph.D. (Kharkov) is the Representative for Ukraine and Valeri V. Druzhilnyi (Dalnegorsk) becomes our Representative for Eastern Russia. Other new assignments in the C.I.S. are pending. Gerrit J. Gerwig, Ph.D. (Nieuwegein, Utrecht), a Consultant in Bio-Organic Chemistry, has accepted the additional role of Representative for the Netherlands. Michael J. Strainic has appointed Lech K. Lesiak (Calgary) to the position of Provincial Director for Alberta. Glenn O. Rutherford (Louisville), a former State Director for Kentucky, has again accepted this respon- sibility with James C. DeLotel (Louisville) serving as his Assistant State Director. Assistant State Director for West Virginia, Gregg B. Knight (Bridgeport), has been reassigned as State Section Director for Marion, Harrison, Taylor, Barbour, Lewis and Upshure Counties. Other new State Section Directors are: Benard E Marcinowski (Gig Harbor, WA) for Pierce Coun- ty; Joyce McDavid, Ph.D., (San Antonio, TX) for Bexar County; Mrs. Gayle Treadwell (Beeville, TX) for Bee and Live Oak Counties; Harry A. Jordan, M.A. (Omaha, NE) for Douglas and Sarpy Counties; John C. Craig (Castle Rock, CO) for Elbert County; and Judith Rydlun (Boulder, CO) for Boulder County.
