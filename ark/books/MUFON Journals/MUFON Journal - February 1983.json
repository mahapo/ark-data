FROM THE EDITOR Leaving aside the first definition of \"skeptic\" from the Brirannica World Language Dictionary (having to do with the doctrines of religion), a skeptic is defined as \"One who refuses concurrence in generally accepted conclusions in science, philosophy, etc.\" Thus, those of us who reject the consensus of Science that UFOs are nonsense are the true skeptics. Where does that leave the self-styled skeptics such as members of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOR)? Judging by the sTarbaby controversy (in which CSICOP Board members are caught debunking, rather than holding that the consensus of science might be wrong), they are the \"Defenders of the Faith.\" The sTarbaby constroversy has to do with statistical arguments that tend to support an \"astrological\" (horrors!) argument. We hold no brief for astrology, but we do question the intellectual integrity of the CSICOP members who — essentially — set out to destroy the data and defame the researchers involved The controversy has been well reported in FATE and in the ZETETIC SCHOLAR. It is a sad commentary on the viability of science as a mediator of controversial claims. In this issue UFO INSTRUMENT LANDING SYSTEM   3 By William D.

Leet (Copyright ©1982 by William D. Leet) The first case investigated by Bluegrass NICAP Affiliate was of special interest in two respects — the UFO left material proof of its visit, and the investigators who were pilots perceived a remarkable resemblance of the UFO's descent and approach pattern to those of ILS, our nationwide aircraft instrument landing system. Under the direction of NICAP Director Major Donald E. Keyhoe, and guidance of Assistant Director Richard H. Hall, our Bluegrass NICAP Affiliate had just been formed and was charged with newborn enthusiasm. An intensive flap was beginning in Central Kentucky of which this case was a harbinger, but this one occurred more than two months earlier and we were lucky to get word of it. C.D. Walker, over and on whose land this action took place, Robert Boggs and George Shelley, were friends and members of the Bluegrass Kiwanis Club. Sunday morning, July 24, 1960, Boggs .went to Walker's farm to tell him that Shelley had died suddenly. Before he left, Boggs was asked by Walker to look at a strip of grass in his lawn that a few days earlier had turned brown. It was 45 feet long and about 26 inches wide, and ran through the middle of the front yard directly toward the porch of the house. Walker explained that \"a flying saucer or something\" had come right along that same path, and he wondered whether that had caused the grass to die. I had spoken to the Bluegrass Kiwanis on UFOs so Boggs suggested notifying me. Walker assented, Boggs called me the next morning, I called Walker and made an appointment, and that evening several other NICAP members and I drove to the Walker farm to interview him and his wife and to examine the purported evidence. The author is Arkansas MUFON State Director and former chairman of the Bluegrass NICAP Affiliate in Kentucky during the 1960's. Almost 8 miles from the Lexington suburbs on the Harrodsburg Pike we arrived at the Walker farm. The home was a pleasant old stone residence nearly a mile back from the road and surrounded by imposing trees. The elderly couple were accomodating and we got right into their account of the events. Mr. Walker stated that at about 10:00 p.m. the night of May 21 they had been looking up at the sky for indications of rain — there had been a \"dry spell\" — when Mrs. Walker noticed something that looked like a \"star with a tail on it.\" It was about 3 miles to the east and 30 degrees elevation, and if held at arm's length would have resembled a star with a tail 6 inches long. The object emanated its own light, which differed from starlight in that it was more like an incandescent electric light. For half a minute or more the two of them watched the sight, but Mrs. Walker was not impressed as May 21st was Armed Forces Day and she assumed the object to be a new type of aircraft. She also suddenly developed a headache and went into the house to take some medicine. The front porch light was on when she entered and she went on back to the kitchen. To Walker's wonderment the thing which he was still observing started to descend and head in a southerly direction. Then it. abruptly made a sharp turn to the right and was gliding straight toward him! On an approximate bearing of 300 degrees along an abandoned tree-lined lane it came head on 8 to 10 feet above the ground straightway into the lawn and did not stop until it was close to the porch and only a few yards from Walker! The transition from 7,500 feet to the yard was done in about 2 minutes. While the UFO was approaching, Walker could see that it was cigar- shaped and had a yellow light in the nose or near end. He estimated it to be 8 feet long and 36 to 40 inches in diameter. It did not make a sound. As it hovered motionless at a slight angle longitudinally he saw that both ends were pointed. The nose light was similar to an automobile fog light, not bright but a dim yellow, and it did not cast a beam. The UFO was rounded and shone like silver, although the moon was not out, and the porch light, being obstructed by the roof, fell about 15 feet short of reaching the UFO. Walker in alarm was retreating to the porch and at the same time observing the apparent craft. Just as he got to the door and was trying to back into it his wife, who a second before had turned off the porch light, was stepping out onto the porch. \"Don't come out here!\" Walker shouted, \"There's a flying saucer or something! Don't come out!\" But Mrs. Walker was already through the door. She did not see the object then, when she returned from the kitchen to the porch, but she said that Walker at the time \"was as white as a sheet and scared to death.\" According to Walker's estimate that the UFO when first seen was 3 miles away and at a 30 degree elevation we can calculate that it was at an altitude of 7,500 feet, and in the 2 minutes required to arrive in his yard it had a rate of descent of 3,750 feet per minute. Later, we measured the trespasser's brown trail to stop 27 yards from the porch. During our interview, Walker said that he had discovered the brown swath through the center of the lawn 5 days previously. That was exactly 60 days after the sighting on May 21st. He said that he strolled in .the yard frequently and was sure he would have noted the change of color had it happened earlier. We were welcome, Mr. Walker told us, to drive our car up close to the strip so we could see it more clearly under the headlights. When the car was driven up to the (confinued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ILS, Continued affected ground the lights became very dim, almost went out, and the engine stopped running. It would not start again until we pushed, the car several yards away from the withered strip, at which point also the headlights regained normal brightness. ' My fellow investigators and I found no reason to doubt the veracity of the Walkers, who were of unimpeachable reputation. They were not only well respected landowners but Mr. Walker was a prominent building contractor in Lexington, expert in directions, time, distances, measurements, materials and structure, and of commendable character. The fact that the Walkers kept knowledge of the incident to themselves so long bolsters their reliability. If anyone suspected Walker of : seeking notoriety his conduct belied it, since he declined my several invitations to appear on my weekly UFO program at the time on WLEX- TV. A NICAP member who was not on the first visit to the site, Marion L. -L. Short, and I made a midmorning trip to the Walker farm two days later. \"Shorty,\" as he preferred to be called, was at that time a Veteran pilot of 31 years, had served as an Air Force lieutenant colonel and pilot, and American Airlines captain and held a B.S. degree in physics. In the bright daylight Shorty and I could see that the strip of brown turf contrasted vividly with the luxuriant blue grass around it, but the damaged grass did not appear to be burned; it looked generally wither- ed though it contained some patches that looked completely destroyed. A question that quickly came to Shorty's and my minds was whether Walker had mowed the strip too close to the ground and \"burned\" it. When the mower blades are set so low that they cut into the soil and roots of the blue grass they \"burn\" it, that is, the band of grass dies even though it is getting sufficient water. Walker mentioned that he always mowed the lawn himself, and indicated that he did so crosswise, from one side of the yard to the other, and perpendicular to the damaged swath. Shorty and I could see from the pattern the mower had made in the grass that this was so. Walker told us that he had cut the grass with a small gasoline power mower three or four times since the UFO's appearance and, regardless of that fact, the brown strip did not become visible until 5 days prior to our interrogation of him and Mrs. Walker. Shorty and I kept probing. To our surprise, measurements showed the width of the brown swath to be the same as the strips .mowed through the healthy grass! They weren't precisely the same, as vegetation by nature will cause some variation, but allowing for that the closeness of the widths was astonishing — right at 26 inches for all of them! Shorty and I exchanged skeptical glances. We both were struck with the stark reality that Walker could have mowed the other way, from the porch out towards the highway and back, every time except the last time he mowed; he could deliberately have burned this trail down the middle of his lawn to, and only 27 yards short of, his porch. The last mowing would make a design running side-to-side regardless of the previous mowing directions and . nobody could detect the difference, but remaining would be the route of the UFO counter to the line of the cut grass. I felt sick and excused myself to Walker and Shorty. I traipsed over to the fence fronting the lawn. \"How can they do this?\" I agonized, \"These nice old folks?\" I leaned my forearms on the old board fence and gazed down the ancient overgrown lane to Harrodsburg Pike, the road leading to the first permanent settlement of Kentucky pioneers. It was up this forgotten lane that Walker said the UFO was coming at him — he said it hurtled this very fence. \"Hey, Bill!\" Shorty called. I ambled back to where he was kneeling by the sickly brown strip. \"Look at this.\" He was holding a handful of the withered blades of grass. \"How long are they?\" Shorty asked-me. \"Two inches,\" I replied. \"Right, and you can see that two inches is the approximate length of all the damaged grass.\" We moved along the swath, kneeling here and there for close inspection. Shorty was right. \"I wonder why we didn't catch this before?\" I asked. \"It wasn't apparent, the way the blades were lying flat and partially covered by the soil due to wind and rain. But this proves the grass was not burned by mowing it too low.\" \"What about weed killer?\" \"That doesn't harm grass, and I don't find any kind of oil or chemicals present that would be injurious.\" Shorty should know, having an expansive blue grass farm of his own. At that instant a new development caught our attention. From the end of (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ILS, Continued the withered path near the porch, another brown strip now took off to the right on a bearing of about 30 degrees, running into an adjacent grove in which it diminished and ended. Shorty and I had not seen it earlier and Walker was positive it had not been there before. We surmised that the UFO had taken this route to exit from the yard while Walker was in the act of trying to get indoors. The grass was turning brown but so far was not as dark as that in the first strip. The width of the path was the same, 26 inches, varying a bit here and there, and the blade length the same. There was no odor whatsoever and the texture of the grass did not reveal the application of petroleum or other com- pound. The delayed reaction was puzzl- ing, but it was only a week later in show- ing than the first swath, which was de- layed 60 days and also was perplexing. We took samples of the damaged grass and soil, which I hand carried to the University of Kentucky Department of Physics, and which were determined by a Dr. Kern to be normal in radioactivity. I then mailed them for chemical analysis to Dr. Rudolph Ozolins of Brookside Laboratories, New Knoxvillel Ohio, but he never received them. These, like many other samples, books, and notes concerning UFOs that we Bluegrass- NICAP investigators collected, mysteriously disappeared.' The soil and vegetation samples of a 1959 physical trace case that I sent at Dick Hall's suggestion to Colonel Robert B. Emerson (USA, Ret.), Emerson Testing Laboratories, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, inexplicably disappeared from his lab. Our Affiliate Secretary, Pat Riddle, a professional engineer, made copious survey notes which departed without trace. A container of other physical samples of the 1959 case took absence from my home, and all of the books I had begun to form a UFO library with vanished from my home and my law office. We didn't know at the time that USAF Intelligence and the FBI had \"got in the act,\" but that could explain the mystifying disappearances. The actuality of a UFO visit to the UFO ILS APPROACH PATTERN TO WALKER FARM FAYETTE- COUNTY JESSAMINE v .LMAHURST  COUNTY \\ C.D. Walker's became indisputable to Bluegrass NICAP members. This elderly couple we found to be of faultless character; the physical evidence was on the grounds to back them up; their effects from the shocking experience substantiates their credibility; Walker's refusal to exploit his experience on television lends still more credence to his report; and, although its significance escaped us at the moment, failure of the auto's engine and headlights to function while near the withered turf dismissed any lingering notions that the damage was the result of earthly instigation. Clearly, the UFO was on a scouting mission and any additional objectives were not discernible, but conspicuous was the approach pro- cedure used by the UFO to descend, line up with, advance to, and enter the yard. In aviation, for the safe and orderly flow of the aircraft traffic to and from airports, there is a rectangular \"traffic pattern,\" the next to last segment of which is the \"base leg.\" From the base leg the pilot makes a 90 degree turn onto the \"final approach,\" on which he aligns the airplane with the runway and establishes the rate of descent to touch down not far from the runway's approach end. That is exactly the type of traffic pattern flown by the Walker UFO. From its stationary position to the east it moved while descending on a southerly heading, or base leg, turning from that onto a final approach of approximately 300 degrees, on which bearing it continued to descend directly into the Walkers' lawn. The turn onto (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ILS, Continued the final from base was probably more than 90 degrees, as much as 120 degrees perhaps, but the UFO flew a definite traffic pattern, entry into which is permitted directly onto the base leg at most airports. Incidentally, the UFO's final approach was straight through the old abandoned lane to the yard. Intriguing yet more is the similarity of the UFO's approach procedure to the instrument landing system, referred to in the aviation profession as ILS, which is an involved but reliable complex the pilot can use, when foul weather has him \"flying blind,\" to approach and land on an airport. Primary among the ILS subsystems are the localizer and glide slope, the former indicating corrections the pilot must make to stay on final approach course, and the latter doing the same for descent. Every instrument pilot respects and depends on ILS but he can employ it only if his ILS receivers and instruments in the aircraft, as well as the transmitting equipment on the airport, are functioning properly. When the UFO was first noticed by Mrs. Walker, its altitude was too high, and then its rate of descent too great, for an ILS approach, but it flew a traffic pattern and got the right position. The precision in the dark night of its approach course and descent to touch down point in the Walker yard was then the performance of a perfect ILS. But where was the transmitting equipment mentioned above that must be on the ground and is essential to ILS operation? C. D. Walker — his intense concentration, his brain waves, were the transmissions received by the UFO for the localizer and glide slope! Why did a craft from another world call on a quiet, elderly couple in the country if it was not receiving their transmissions? There are many features in and near Lexington one would expect to attract UFOs. Among them are the Wenner-Gren Atomic Research Laboratory, which has been on the University of Kentucky campus , since before World ,War II, and numerous industries. If science history is sought, Transylvania, founded in 1780 and the first university in the \"West,\" enshrines the relics of Rafinesque, one of America's early scientists. Nearby are Bluegrass Airport, Army Depot, and many government hospitals, the \"Narcotic Farm,\" among others. The UFO's base leg and ILS approach took it over the luxuriant Alrhahurst Farm, but it did not hesitate on its glide slope and localizer path to the Walkers' lawn. The Walker farm is devoid of iron ore and any other mineral deposits which could cause a magnetic ' attraction, and there were no signs that the UFO explored the land but, instead of doing so, made an abrupt takeoff. The farm exerts no magnetic disparity as disclosed on the Memphis Sectional Aeronautical Chart southeast of Pine Bluff, where the disturbance on the earth's surface is 5 degrees, or between Rison and Bunns Intersections, where there is a severe error of 15 degrees up to 7,000 feet altitude. Okay, you're right. This report is an allegory, a parable. The case actually did happen, and the facts as I have stated them are true to the best of my knowledge and belief, but I concede that the ILS interpretation may be a mite farfetched. I could not help being impressed by. the UFO's actions being so much like an airplane's flying of the traffic pattern and an ILS approach, but let's beware we don't miss the big point: The preponderance of the evi- dence is that the UFO \"homed in\" on C.D: Walker's signal-emanating mind. True UFOIogy — science — demands that we not butt our heads against the rusty wall of nuts-and-bolts thinking. Surely, we need to know what makes UFOs tick, and just as important or maybe more so, we need to know what makes ufonauts minds tick. This Walker case is a speck of a beginning, like the Hill; Pascagoula; Liberty, Kentucky; . Travis Walton; Andreasson; and certain other cases. We must no longer fail to follow up subjective evidence for clues, new approaches, ad infinitum. These can blaze new trails of insight into UFOIogy, and into preparing ourselves to handle them.D TAX EXEMPT CONTRIBUTIONS The Mutual UFO Network, Inc.

THE THAT SCANDINAVIAN NEVER EX SAUCER SCARE ISTED. . . 1 Anders L I 1 jegren (c) Copyright 1982, Archives for UFO Research \"Other magazines print some outlandish stories but I have never seen these types of stories In UFO REPORT\". Reader's letter In UFO Report, November 1979 Issue. How much can we rely on what 's written in those journals, newsletters and books that constitute \"International UFO literature\"..? During the 1970s I have become increasingly critical of alI sources, especially those where one could suspect that the author - or publisher - has made a considerable fi- nancial gain from what he puts out. Hoaxes or false stories could crop up In any source but most likely In commercially produced magazines, or media publis- hed by people whose wl1l-to-belleve Is far greater than their wlIl-to-Investigate. Reliability also decreases with distance and lack of confirmation from independent sources. In American magazines, In particular, where the drive to earn money is far greater than In other parts of the world, you could easily find dozens of suspicious \"stories\" - reports that have gone unconfirmed by other more reliable sources such as the major Investigation networks APRO, HUFON or CUFOS. \\kose suspect stories are most often signed by authors unknown to investi- gative circles of ufology, pen-names or \"ufologlsts\" whose reputation for honest and truthful reporting could be better. It is obviously very easy to fool magazine editors...or even to fool yourself... Would non-Swedes put credence in a sensationalized, but clever, mixture of about half-a-dozen fantastic Swedish \"first-hand cases\" reputedly \"investigated\" and \"documented\" by Swedish experts? Some would, but a small wise and knowledgable fraction - who had seen no Swedish confirmation whatsoever - would be scept icai. If you bought the October 1980 Issue of the American newsstand magazine UFO Report (1) you were teased, on the colourful front-page, to read about \"UFOs over Sweden - documented report of_ Air Force jets' supersonic saucer chase\". You would then read the story inside and be treated with a series of highly plausible incidents. There are documented reports of Swedish jet pilots seeing UFOs (2), there are Swedish policemen who have had sightings (3), and there was Indeed (so we believe) a rather nasty ab- duction attempt at Oonsten, Sweden In December 1958 (1|), as is claimed In the article, but still almost every 1ine of the UFO Report report is fabricated data!11 You don't have to spend a week investigating \"the sources\". Any knowledgable Swedi sh ufologist would immediately recognize the story for what It's worth. But you others... those of you who do not know about Swedish ufologlsts and UFO report history, those of you who are not familiar with Swedish geography or Swedish newspapers - would you suspect a hoax when you read about \"incidents\" at locations you had heard about and easily find on the map, \"incidents\" \"reported\" by \"people\" whose names you recognize as sounding Swedish...77 Would you suspect that an un- scrupulous writer would put never-said statements in the mouth of one of Scandinavia's most respected UFO experts... NO NEED FOR LAUGHS... ' 'The Scandinavian Saucer Scare\" a s Y.S.Jonsson ' s article Is titled, is nothing but an elaborate hoax on ufology. I will snow this wi thout doing much in- vestigation. J_f I investigated further with some of the reported sources - such as some Swedish defence authorities - I would probably get one cr two good laughs. Peopls outside of ufology would have another millstone to put on our already weak necks... Reports of Swedish jet fighters chasing UFOs have been persistent, both from ground witnesses and from a few puzzled pilots who dared to come of the secrecy. The UFO Report story claims, however, that on Dec 11, 1978 two Draken fighters from the F-16 wing of the Swedish Air Force, at Uppsala, chased a torpedo-shaped UFO over the Baltic, an object which was also detected and followed by ground ra- dar. The chase resulted, so it is claimed, in a near-collision and a rather panicky conversation on the radio. The pilots, unlike most down-to-earth Swedish defence pilots, were certain they had encoun- tered a \"space ship\"... THE STOCKHOLM INTERVIEW THAT NEVER TOOK PLACE... Author \"Y.S.Jonsson\", whoever that is, says It took him \"27 phone calls, two beers and a long-overdue favor\" before he could meat one of the pilots at a Stockholm restaurant (...non-existent In the tele- phone directory..), where he got his \"exclusive\" story, promising not to reveal the true identity of one of the witnesses-pilots. A \"watered-down\" ver- sion of the incident was reportedly published in \"Aftondagbladet\" (...strangely ther^ is, and has never been, as Swedish newspaper by that name...) on Dec. 13, 1978. I checked the extensive files of Archives for. UFO researci (AFU), which contains some 15.000 Swedish UFO press-clippings arranged chronologically. There was not one single line about any UFO-ecnounter In any Swedish paper that day. (Since 1970 a commercial Stockholm bureau cuts everything about UFOs from the Swedish press and they very seldom miss out a chance to earn mo- ney...) The pilots, upon landing, were - says \"Y.S.Jonsson\" - greeted by a staff officer from \"Forsvarets Expe- (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Scandinavia, Continued dIt ions\" (a redlculous name which doea not mean \"Supreme Command\" as claimed...) and hushed-up after a \"l)5-mlnute highly technical brleffng\".

Of course, there could have been a pilot/UFO encoun- ter over the BaItIc on Dec. II, 1978. Making Inqui- ries with defence authorities would, naturally, lead to dentals even If there was one small ounce of truth to this highly sensationalized report, which I sincerely doubt there Is... The \"Jonsson\" story contlnous by reporting about other \"thoroughly documented evidence that hostlle(!) intruders have been paying special attention to Swe- dish skies\")I For instance, on March 3, 1976, ar- tillery officers \"reported seven disc-shaped objects ...during a field exercise at Lulea\". The Incident was \"widely reported In the press, not merely In Sweden but by United Press International\"... (Not so, there is not one line of print about the \"Inci- dent\" In the Swedish press archives of AFU, and I congratulate any International researcher who's able to find anything from UPI in his local news- papers...) Similarly It Is claimed that on Sept. I 1977 a Llnjeflyg Fokker F-28 jetliner was \"buzzed by a lone UFO\" and had a near mid-air collision. (Of course, no press reports, no rumours In ufolo- gist circles, nothing to support the claim...) THE OOHSTEN MISREPRESENTATION \"Jonsson\" breaks his redlculous rep It Ion of non- events with something that really happened - but not as \"Jonsson\" says I While witness's names and pIace-of-occurence - as well as the date - are correct for the 1958 Domsten abduction attempt, not much else !s true. For Instance the alien creatures were not \"throwing goo\" at Stlg Rydberg and Hans Gustavsson, the witnesses. For a correct version of this Interesting case please check out on« of the Lorenzen books (It). I will not bother you with all the detal 1s-In-fault here. A similar \"report\", by the \"Jonsson\" pen, of a UFO\"spltting forth chemical goo\" In the seaport of Gothenburg Is nothing but a saga. No Swede has ever heard about that one... Finally comes the \"report\" from \"criminal Inspee- . tor Lennart Hellberg\", driving between Stockholm and NorrtSlJe (...there Is another we 11 known case where the percipients were driving that particular road, what a co-Incidence...). The problem with the \"HelIberg\" case Is that, while driving this road his UFO encounter occurred \"only a few kilo- meters' ! from VSsteras, site of Sweden's most impor- tant Jet fighter base\". I advice the reader to fetch a detailed map of Sweden. You will then discover that while driving from Stockholm to NorrtSlJe you could not possibly come near to VSsteras. You will never be Tes\"s than about 80 kilometres, as the crow files, from VSsterasI \"Jonsson\" further maintains that 8 \"Hellberg\" was Interviewed by Svenska Oagbladet on Jan. 7, 1980. Maybe so, but the Interview was never published and the matter has never been raised in any Swedish newspaper. There are no Swedish sources at all for this \"report\" and we at AFU are definitely in a positlon-to-knowl OTOLOGISTS THAT NEVER EXISTED... Mingled Into \"Jonsson's\" article are names and facts about Swedish ufology that match reality, but also quite Impossible claims. On several points \"Jonsson\" refers to K.GSsta Rehn, APRO representative for Swe- den. Rehn was not an active UFO investigator In 1978. Several months before the claimed Oraken/UFO encoun- ter Rehn, more or less, gave up ufology while turning over most of his collection and data to the AFU archi- ves. Today Rehn Is 90 years of age and almost blind. He Is -definitely not a \"saucer-watcher\" as claimed, but a serious ex-invest I gator who would be very much offended by \"Jonsson's\" attempts to put words Into his mouth. Rehn published two.Swedish books In 1966 and 1969 - true - but had not his \"third due to print in 1981\" as \"Jonsson\" claims. Rehn's third book was released in 1972 and his fourth, and final one, in 1976. The -72 book is available in a slightly re-edi- ted English version (5). Rehn is the only\" Scandina- vian researcher featured in Ronald 0.Story's Encyclo- pedia of UFOs (page 300). Other Swedish \"researchers\" are cited: \"College pro- fessor l.ars S'.indlin has assembled affidavits from witnesses in more than 100 sightings\"... We are quite impressed to leern that we have such a \"star\" among Swedish ufologist - unknowingly! It is claimed that Sundlin (or Sundin) is a member of the UFO-Sweden or- ganization. I checked with their membership registry, but Sundlin/Sundln is not to be found in the card index of about 9.000 Swedes who, at one time or anot- her, showed an interest in ufology. Mo report has ever been pub 1ished by that \"man\" In Swedish litera- ture. Another non-existent person is \"GOran Llndqvlst\", ufologist and author of a book, according to \"Jons- son\". A few years ago AFU published a iM-page bib- liography of Swedish UFO literature where GSran Lindqvist is strangely absent... The author also mention B8rje Nllsson as being the editor of a \"highly animated monthly magazine\". Yes, there was one BSrje Nilsspn who was responsible for two or three Issues of \"Flygande tefat\", a colourful comic- book representation of the American type, bought from \"Westtern Publishing Co. Inc. Racine, Wiscon- sin, USA\", translated and released by the non-serious publishing house Semic Press. Translating these comic strip representations of well-known foreign cases hardly qualify Borje Nllsson as a \"researcher\",,J Meed I say that neither \"GSrarv Lindqvist\" nor B6rje Nllsson are Found In the UFO-Sweden registry of ufologists..7 And so It Is... There was no serious UFO wave In Sweden during the 1976-80 period (..\"almost every- body In Sweden, especially In military circles, knows about the UFO wave\"...), there was no \"sca- re\", no general fear about UFOs during those years. Not more than during the proceeding years. There were genuin cases that puzzled authorities, but those cases were never reported by UFO Report, or by \"Jonssson\". Who Is \"Y.S.Jonsson\"? I don't know. I doubt that he will ever step forward, but I will send this article to him via Stephen Ciacclarelly - associa- te editor of UFO Report - who has promised to for- ward my opinion. I also hope that UFO Report, which has earned a fairly good reputation, will not accept further \"data\" from this source or any other source who comes up with strangely unconfirmed foreign data.

By Mark Moravec (Copyright © 1980 by Mark Moravec) Some of the more exotic UFO reports involve claims of \"mental communication\" with UFO entities. On the surface, such reports suggest that selected people can communicate with nonhuman intelligences by means of \"telepathy.\" An alternative explanation is that the people involved are psychologically disturbed and are merely describing delusions which have no basis in physical reality. In this paper, I will look at a number of Australian \"mental communication\" cases and show how they can be interpreted as primarily, due to psychological disturbance. Case 1. Mr. A. has had one major sighting of what he believes to be a UFO. One night he had a strong impulse to go to the local airport. He went onto the observation deck and saw a bright, round light in the sky; a light which \"took off past the moon.\" The impulse to go to the airport was so strong that he got a headache. Sandinavia, Continued \"Jonsson\" might be an American who studied the li- terature and made up plausible claims by mixing names and places he found in articles on Swedish UFOs i iifology for instance by John A. Keel. He could even be a money-thirsty Sweden who didn't ma- nage to tell his story so well. If he is a Swede the article is very \"weak\", unless it was \"designed\" and \"planted\" as a test of the seemingly non-exis- tent reafity tests some publications and ufologists employ when they choose their data. In any case it is another serious warning against accepting unveri- fied cases from far-off places, anywhere In the world.

These interferences do not usually result in injury although some cases of disappearance have been attibuieJ to the interference of UFOs. the case, we have to look at the person's reported experiences and how close these match up with the reported experiences of people who have been judged as psychologically disturbed. We also have to look at the reporter's background to see if there are any factors or crises which may have contributed to a psychological disturbance. In this and the following cases, there are a number of experiences typical of those reported by \"paranoid schizophrenics.\" According to 0 traditional psychological definitions, paranoid schizophrenia primarily involves disturbances in cognitive functioning. The individual may have delusions where real events are misinterpreted in a way which substantially differs from consensual reality and where these interpretations significantly influence the person's thoughts and behavior. Less often, the individual may also have hallucinations where he \"perceives\" people, objects, or events which do exist. Hallucinations may involve any of the five senses, though auditory and visual hallucinations (in that order) are the most frequent. As the term suggests, the most common delusion of paranoid schizophrenics is a paranoid fear of being influenced and controlled by outside forces. Although common sense may initially suggest otherwise, a belief in a hostile world offers many psychological advantages. For one thing, a paranoid person is relieved of personal responsibility for his own situation. The blame for personal failures and wrongdoings is always placed upon somebody else. Paranoia can be viewed as a psychological defense mechanism which projects the individual's responsibility onto the external world. Another advantage of paranoia is (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Disturbance, Continued that a person can make an uncertain world predictable. No longer does he have to battle with his own personal conflicts or with subtle social influences. The paranoid's \"enemies\" are clearcut — all he has to do is to fight \"them,\" and then life will become rosy. However, because this is a delusion, he will never succeed. The paranoid individual gains a short-term comfort at the expense of obtaining long-term solutions to his problems. Subjective Experience In the case of Mr. A., the subjective experience of his mind being controlled by outside forces is typical of the paranoid individual. The \"invisible\" beings are hallucinations which help provide companionship and meaning to an isolated, alienated man. The predicted natural disasters are part of a pseudo-religious belief which functions to de-emphasize the individual's own weaknesses by emphasizing the failings of other people. A number of factors in the reporter's background probably , contributed to his psychological disturbance. He is a 56-year-old migrant who lives alone in a small room with only the barest of essentials. He has trouble staying at jobs, and sometimes fights the people there (\"they're all against me, and I don't know why\"). He sometimes strikes out in frustration. In his home country, he sometimes wanted to kill himself because \"it was all too much\" for him. All these details show that Mr. A. has trouble coping with everyday life. His isolation, older age, and the social dislocation of trying to settle in a new country have all probably contributed to his present state of affairs. His UFO sighting is only a Jew-weight nocturnal light with no supporting witnesses or physical evidence. Since he has read a lot of UFO literature with a preference for the \"way-out\" type of articles, we can safely conclude that Mr. A. has merely incorporated UFO material into his delusions. Case 2. Mrs. B. claims to have had three UFO sightings. The first was 30 10 years ago when she and a girlfriend saw an unusual object or light on a clear summer day. In the most recent sighting, her home was \"buzzed\" as a light went slowly overhead, \"hovered\" for 5 minutes, and then went slowly away. In addition,to these sightings, the reporter claims a continuing series of bizarre experiences involving contact with, and harrassment by, unidentified entities or forces. Her experiences started some 4 years ago and were mostly centered in her home. She claims that items of clothing disappeared when she wanted to use them and then later reappeared. Electrical equipment broke down; the television went haywire. She receives peculiar phone calls from people with unusual, unrecognizable voices who tell her they've seen her, to come and meet them, or that they will come and visit her. She is also under telepathic control to make telephone calls to strangers. She claims to be a medium and is occasionally taken over in deep trance, afterwards unable to remember anything. The reporter attributes other experiences to persecution by scientologists. She is controlled at a distance by an unidentified hypnotist who forces her to write \"psychic\" letters against her will and either post them or deliver them to a \"contact\" she refuses to name. Mrs. B. doesn't know when she is \"under hypnosis,\" but other people notice she is acting differently. Thoughts not her own are being put into her head. She is watched all the time and is'followed around by people in cars. \"One day a garden truck tried to run over me.\" She believes the scientologists are trying to drive her crazy because she resists their attempts to get money out of her. It should be noted that Mrs. B's first and only contact with the scientologists (before the present \"harrassment\") was over 20 years ago. Mrs. B. believes that other people (especially men) dislike her for no reason at all. Somehow she manages to \"turn everyone off.\" She is blamed for anything that goes wrong and keeps losing her job. When she moved home, she received more strange telephone calls and she believes her phone was tapped. She then moved into a hotel in the same area and one day found her door smashed in. More recently, Mrs. B. claims to have been kidnapped and beaten by \"entities.\" Incidentally, the reporter claims to have an unusually large aura and to be \"psychic\" like her mother. (Some cases) can be interpret- ed in either a UFOlogical or a psychopathological frame- work. These data can be interpreted in either a UFOlogical or a psychopatho- logical framework. In the UFOlogical framework, we can take note of the three nocturnal light sightings. However, these are of a low weight and Mrs. B. was very vague on details. The misplaced clothes could be interpreted as a poltergeist (teleportation) effect. The malfunctioning of electrical equipment also falls into line. The communication with \"entities\" could be interpreted as contact with the UFO intelligence. However, the witness is unsure of who she is \"in contact\" with. The harrassment could be interpreted as a \"Men-in-Black\" manifestation (except that she attributes it to scientologists and is not sure whether it is connected with her UFO sightings). In the psychopathological framework, we can interpret the reporter's experiences as matching the symptom pattern of paranoid schizophrenia. Mrs. B. appears to have paranoid ideas of reference where she unjustifiably associates external events with herself. For example, the alleged harrassment by scientologists and entities; thoughts being put into her head by hypnosis; being forced to write letters; receiving threatening phone calls; being followed at night; and even her disappearing clothes are seen as part of some conspiracy directed against her. She is projecting her own unacceptable thoughts and feelings onto other people and events so that it appears that she is being persecuted. The reporter also has had hallucinations. An example is the man (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Disturbance, Continued who picked her up one night and who supposedly turned into a repulsive caterpillar right before her eyes. Her perception of self is disturbed. She feels that she has been taken over by other personalities whom she must please. If the reporter is going through a schizophrenic episode, what triggered it off? It probably is not a coincidence that these bizarre experiences started shortly after she was divorced 4 years ago. My impression is that the reporter was searching for a label for her experiences (i.e., as due to UFO entities, or scientologists, or something else). As far as can be determined, all her reported experiences are completely subjective. Thus it is most likely that Mrs. B's experiences are due to a disturbed psychological state triggered off by her marital breakup. \"Spiritual Lights\" Case 3. For many years, Mr. C. claims to have seen \"beautiful spiritual lights\" colored pink, green, blue, or orange. The lights come down, stop in midair, and burst into many beautiful colors. The largest UFO he saw was a large ball of white light with a gray- colored central cabin. The object seemed to land close to a ridge. The reporter later discovered a \"blasted\" boulder which he connected with the light. Mr. C. wanted to go to bed, but a \"voice\" said to him: \"don't go, wait.\" He waited and \"saw the most beautiful sight I could ever see\" — white, zig- zagging lights. Mr. C. claims to have had several voice contacts. On a bushwalk, he heard a voice tell him which was the right path to take: \"The track is on your left side....I said thank you whoever you are, turned left 20 feet and beheld the track. Was it a UFO being who could bend light waves, or was it a spirit from the other side....? Another time, the voice of his mother told him that he was on the wrong river. When he goes \"deep into the UFO country\" he receives the feeling that little friendly people are present and are guiding him deeper into the gorge. Mr.' C. believes there may be a UFO base nearby and that he is a medium \"1 DIDN'T HEAR ALL THE MESSAGE, BUT SOMEBODY JUST SCRAMBLED TWO FIGHTERS TO INTERCEPT A UFO.\" receiving the higher vibrations which others can't perceive. Amongst other subjective experiences, Mr. C. has had the feeling that someone was in the house with him and has had dreams in which he saw an \"underground hangar.\" He claims to be able to track UFOs with divining rods and claims \"spiritual gifts\" of divining for water and minerals, trance healing, automatic writing, reading flowers and teacups, voices and visions, ESP communica- tions with animals, and psychometry. At least some of the UFO sightings appear to be explainable. The bursting lights could be flares. According to the witness himself, a television news report stated that the most spectacular sighting was actually of a meteorite. The possible physical evidence of the blasted boulder is unconfirmed. Mr. C's subjective experiences indicate a disturbed psychological state. The \"voices\" are most probably hallucinations. This is especially indicated by the incident involving his mother's voice, which functioned to provide comfort and reassurance to him while in his isolated mode of existence. The man's background indicates difficulties in coping with life. At age 49 he had a nervous breakdown after his marriage broke up. He now lives alone, except for his dog. He owns his own home and people call him a \"Pension Bludger.\" In one of his letters, Mr. C. asks: \"Why me, why?? Who am I. Just a battler through life, hated all my life, but have kept as far out in front as I could.\" Mr. C.'s experiences appear to consist of delusions and hallucinations associated with misinterpretations of mundane lights and incorporating UFO and psychic lore. His marriage breakup, his profound isolation, and his advanced years have probably all contributed to this current state of affairs. (To be continued.

However, by sheer weight of numbers, narratives of close encounters must be given serious consideration. We cannot ignore these reports even when they are not backed up by physical evidence. Something is clearly happening to numerous humans on every continent. When the case involves two or more witnesses, we tend to add greater weight to the credibility of the report, but what do we do with the hundreds of single-witness cases? The question is, of course, how really reliable are these \"credible\" single-witness cases. I have recently become aware of a peculiar problem which afflicts some unfortunate people — a problem which might possibly explain some of these so-called \"contact\" cases we hear about. I refer to those persons who seem to live normal, productive lives but who, upon closer observation, can be proven to be inveterate liars. These persons are not sociopaths (psychopaths), for there is no evidence of the anti-social behavior or any clinical or behavioral disorder. 1 Often* sociopaths are able to mimic normal emotions but the social relationships remain superficial and demanding. Their inability to delay gratification of momentary needs lead them frequently into trouble with family, associates, and often the law. If protected by family and friends, they may avoid being branded officially as sociopathic, or if they operate in a sector of society which tolerates their demands and outbursts they may get along without being recognized by normal members of society for what they really are. 12 . Most sociopathic (psychopathic) persons who report close encounters, however, are easily recognized by the veteran researcher. They are the ones who drain the energy of investigators by persistent demands for attention, time, and recognition. Experienced UFOlogists learn rather quickly to 'avoid establishing on-going relationships and prolonged study of their claims. The type of person I am referring to, however, seems to function well in society. Upon first acquaintance they display the ability for normal social behavior, are talented and seem thoroughly reliable. Upon closer acquaintance, which often blossoms into friendship, it gradually becomes clear that they are afflicted with a sad compulsion to tell untruths as readily as they relate truths. One is eventually forced to admit that they cannot tell when these friends are lying or not. Yet these persons lovingly support spouses, raise fine families, attend church, abide by civil laws, please us with kindnesses, and are often generous to a fault. ' It would be interesting to know whether psychology has fit such persons into a labelled niche. The best explanation I can find for those very few of my friends who have this problem of embellishment (to the point of lying) is that subconscious feelings of inferiority force them into struggles of rivalry, and their embellishments (lies) are born from a desire to \"tell tales\" worthy of being listened to. Aside from the uneasy situation of not knowing whether to believe what those acquaintances are saying, these persons make pleasant and helpful friends and neighbors, and the best advice is to listen to their conversations with amused interest. However, if in the course of life UFO investigators have encountered this type of otherwise-normal embellisher (liar), it becomes apparent that at least some of these type people might be reporting UFO sightings, including close encounters and contacts. In such a case, investigation of their life situation would reveal essentially normal human beings and only prolonged investigative study would disclose their unfortunate,, subconscious need to lie. In short, we cannot accept close encounter, reports from anyone with whom we have not had a long investigative relationship. Yet, if there are genuine close encounters backed up by physical evidence, there is every chance that seemingly rational witnesses, reporting encounters unbacked by acceptable physical evidence, are also describing genuine encounters. For, I reiterate, the type of person who compulsively.lies but still lives an essentially normal life is rarely met. . Putting aside the question of the essentially normal, but compulsive embellisher (for I brought it up only because I have never seen this problem discussed in UFO literature), we will proceed to the main topic of this column. What criteria must we demand for encounter reports (especially single- witness sightings)? Would it be sufficient if such a witness also happened to be a UFO researcher of long experience and good reputation — in essence, a trusted colleague? Or would even veteran researchers of impeccable credentials be disbelieved if they reported close encounters in which occupant sightings and \"communication\" were essential factors, if these reports were not backed up by \"sufficient\" hard physical evidence? I ask this question because I am (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued increasingly aware of colleagues in the UFO field who admit confidentially that they have had \"close encounters\" of one type or another at one phase in their lives. Until recently none of these colleagues had been among the pioneer or veteran researchers I've known since my entry into the field in 1957. But rumors were spreading. On December 20, 1982, in answer to a direct query by mail, Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, a Psychology professor at the University of Wyoming, sent me a brochure regarding the 1982 Rocky Mountain Conference of UFO Investigation. This conference was the third contactee conference held in that area. Among the list of participants was No. 54, R. Leo Sprinkle, PhD. The : 'Year of Interview\" was listed as 1980 and the following \"Summary of UFO Experience\" was stated in the brochure: 2 With the aid of a fellow psychologist, the writer (Sprinkle) used hypnotic procedures to explore his memories of a fifth grade experience; an apparent encounter on board a space craft with a tall man, who instructed Leo to learn to read and write well so that, when he was older, he could help other people to become more aware of their purposes in life. Congratulations are in order for Leo Sprinkle. He is, to my knowledge, the first veteran, credentialed, and highly respected UFO researcher to make public an apparent close encounter with \"UFO\" occupants, including communication meaningful to the witness. Firsthand information from such a source is invaluable, for he is a friend to many in the field and no one has proved himself more reliable. It is apparent why other researchers who have neither the reputation nor credentials of Dr. Sprinkle but who nevertheless feel they have had close encounter experiences do not want to talk openly about them. Their reputations would probably be immediately at stake, their credibility would be demolished, and their effectiveness in the field might be reduced to zero. The problem lies in our need to seek scientific verification of such contacts. Such verification would mean that objective, physical evidence must be presented by the witness/researcher that such a contact took place. In most, if not all, such cases that would be a virtually impossible task. All they really have to present to their colleagues are memories of experiences they consider to be UFOlogical in nature. We are, at present, more than willing to accept colleagues' reports of seeing foo-fighters during WW. II, or daytime disks (or even CE-I's). Our acceptance wanes slightly at talk of CE-' II's, if lasting physical evidence cannot be presented by the researcher/wit- ness. But the line of acceptance immediately snaps shut when a colleague speaks of experiencing a single-witness CE-III, or God forbid!, a so-called \"abduction scenario\" happening to him. Why is this so? Why can we investigate CE-III and CE-IV reports which lack physical evidence from strangers, but ignore reports from respected and productive colleagues. Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that we can maintain objectivity with ordinary witnesses but cannot maintain objectivity with someone we know. The situation is somewhat akin to a surgeon who is able to operate on his patients but who would fear to operate on his own child. Still, what better way to study the UFO phenomenon than .to study reports of close encounters from people in the UFO field? What is needed to make such persons feel . comfortable in describing their experiences publicly? Do they require the support of people in the same boat? Would a group of such researchers be necessary before they would gather the courage, as has Leo Sprinkle, to speak out? How many would be needed before scientists would feel the reports had sufficient quantity to become significant? Ten? Twenty? One hundred? Or more? I would suggest that those researchers who. feel they have had experiences equivalent to CE-III or CE- IVs, and who have been in- the field sufficient time to establish strong credibility, think seriously about joining forces with one another.

I have had no close encounter experience that I am aware of but there is one thing I strongly .suspect: that UFO researchers possess their peculiar commitment for a reason.

'Alvin Lawson reports some particularly suggestive findings in his continuing research on his hypothesis that forgotten details and feelings from our birth trauma (BT) are a major factor in those \"abduction\" stories people relate under hypnosis. He and the hypnotist he works with, Dr. William McCall, sometimes ask people who have no UFO experience to imagine one under hypnosis — and find that the stories of these \"imaginary abductions\" are so similar to \"real abductions\" as to suggest all such stories may come from a single source, such as a common experience like birth. A. particularly suggestive case occurred while a BBC television crew was filming one of these \"imaginary abductions\" for use on NOVA's UFO program. (This entire segment, unfortunately, wound up on the cutting room floor.) McCall hypnotized two \"imaginary\" subjects and they related CE-III stories as requested, and then he took one of the subjects back through her own birth experience. While talking later, she mentioned that the two experiences seemed identical: \"...all the pictures and the colors and shapes inside were the same....It seemed to be the same experience, in a way. Tunnels, and all the colors were red. And even the idea of being brought into the UFO in the first place. There seemed to be an almost instinctive reason to go in there...and also an instinctive reason to go into the tunnel that I saw in the birth experience.\" As Lawson comments, it couldn't have been better if he had written a script, since it came \"right from the hallucinator's mouth.\" (Although it could have been better, of course, if NOVA had used that segment.) 14 Currently Lawson and McCall work with a group of subjects with known birth problems, regress them to their birth, and then give them an imaginary CE-III to see if the birth problem comes up. The first test in the series was positive: The subject was a 25-year-old woman who had a problem birth — breech (posterior) with partial placenta praevia. The story she told included a number of breech images — and then she left the UFO by backing out! This is believed the first such in UFO \"abduction\" literature. None of this, of course, \"proves\" his hypothesis, but would seem to be suggestive supporting evidence. I noted a line in a new book that strikes me as a good illustration of what happens in many \"abduction\" cases: \"The human mind abhors chaos, finding order even if there is none.\" This is from The Cosmic Code by Heinz Pagels, and refers to the science of physics. But I think it applies also to everyday life and particularly to the UFO field. Someone who may already be under unusual stress undergoes a series of experiences one day, some of which are classified as \"UFO.\" Later perhaps this person goes under hypnosis, and takes these unrelated happenings and combines them with material already in the brain into a story of being \"abducted\" onto a UFO. In other words, on some day when the random events of daily life seem even more random than usual, and when we happen to see a strange light in the sky or when we 'are left with an inexplicable feeling of \"something strange happened,\" we may \"find order\" by creating a UFO story which neatly ties together all those odd elements we couldn't understand. Incidentally, The Cosmic Code is an easy-to-read summation of the vast changes in physics over the years, from Galileo to quantum physics. •••••••••••••••••••ft* UFO researchers who suspect that a considerable number of reported UFOs are natural meteorological or electrical events will want to look over Lightning, Auroras, Noctural Lights, and Related Luminous Phenomena, a catalog of geophysical anomalies compiled by William R.

Mr. Wanderer seems to be one of those unfortunate commentators on the UFO mystery who likes to find \"psychological\" causes for close encounters and abductions, but without bothering to study anything about the causes, nature, and psychophysiology of sleep, hallucina- tions, mental imagery, and so forth. First of all, despite what Mr. Wanderer believes, driving long hours at night while tired does not cause a person to \"see things.\" What is called \"road hypnosis\" refers to a momentary redirection of attention which may last for a few minutes. Hallucinations do not occur, though on occasion a shadow or some other stimulus will cause a person to experience an \"illusion.\" This however causes the driver to return to full consciousness and usually to an awareness that a trick has been played by his senses. To believe that any type of road hypnosis could cause a long- term amnesia and hallucinations of a close UFO encounter is simply ridiculous. The fact that a major Brazilian publication refused to publish the Villas-Boas story is not pertinent. Mr. Wanderer is apparently unaware that this poor lad experienced an abnormal skin rash which defied diagnosis as part of his experience and that there was independent corroboration to the fact that UFO activity was rife in his area at the time of his abduction. Mr. Wanderer's \"explanation\" for Jerome Clark's \"ultimate alien encounter\" is also rather far-fetched. Neither emotional tension, nor long driving causes visual hallucinations. Nor can this explanation account for the fact that both subjects came up with highly complex and mutually corroborative accounts while independently hypnotized. Note that Mr. Wanderer does not attempt to explain just how this weird story could have mutually emerged within two minds as the result of psychological fatigue and stress. Nor does he explain how any of this relates to a birth trauma type experience, no matter how possibly symbolized. If Mr. Wanderer wishes to find psychological explanations of UFO abduction scenarios, he has a responsibility to show exactly how they arise. This he has totally failed to do. Mr. Wanderer's lack of insight into the nature of hallucinatory experiences is even more evident when he comments on Ann Druffel's \"Dapple Grey Lane,\" which he explains.may have been due to the possibility that one of the subjects was drinking that night. While it is true that alcohol \"affects perception,\" drinking — despite the common misconception — does not induce visual hallucinations. The only exception to this is the hallucination syndrome which accompanies alcoholic hallucinosis and delerium tremens, which only occurs to chronic alcoholics who have suffered brain damage and who are in such a horrible state of mind and. brain that they couldn't even drive if they wanted to! The content of these hallucinations are also very stereotyped and have little connection with anything that could feasibly account for a UFO abduction! As I mentioned, Mr. Wanderer is the latest in a host of proto-UFOlogists who try to explain many of the byways of this strange field along psychological lines. It would be helpful if these commentators would actually study psychology before foisting their opinions onto those of us who have. Even as cautious a researcher as Allan Hendry makes this fatal error in his The UFO Handbook, where he adopts the \"Wandererian\" thoery that some UFO close encounters and abductions can be explained as \"isolation hallucinations\" due to the lonely drives the victims of these events are so often undergoing at the time. As a matter of fact, isolation hallucinations — which manifest solely as a feeling on an invisible presense in most instances — only occur when a person has been isolated from human contact for an extremely extended length of time. Mountain climbers experience them rather commonly at high altitudes, and these experiences can be accounted for physiologically as a result of cerebral anoxia. In simple fact, there is nothing in the large body of literature on hallucinations, hypnagogic imagery and mental imagery that can in the least account for UFO abductions. I, for one, am rather tired of \"psychological\" explanations for these cases which are more incredible than the UFO mystery itself. D Robert Wanderer replies: I have always had a great deal of respect for Mr. Rogo's writing, and therefore I was disappointed at the generalizations and the name-calling in his response here. He begins by assigning me to the general category of \"unfortunate commentators\" who seek \"to find 'psychological' causes,\" and then rails at the category without dealing with the key issues I raised. One such issue in my review concerned the believability of the chief witness in \"Dapple Gray,\" who also contended that no atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. I will defer to Mr. Rogo's alleged psychological expertise, but surely one doesn't need a PhD in psychology to dismiss such a witness as (to quote Mr. Rogo in other contexts) \"simply ridiculous\" and \"rather far-fetched.\" Some other aspects of his response which I find strange: 1. \"The fact that a major Brazilian publication refused to publish the Villas Boas story is not pertinent.\" I consider it reasonable that an experienced .newspaperman on the scene would know more about the man's credibility than third- and fourth-hand theorists such as Mr. Rcgo and myself. 2. \"Drinking...does not cause visual hallucination.\" I never said it did. I merely indicated that drinking might (continued on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"SOUTH AMERICAN MAGAZINE MIMICS U.S. UFO EVENT By John F. Schuessler Journalist Bob Pratt of Lake Worth, Florida, was scanning the many reports of UFOs to be found in the November 1982 issue of a UFO Newsclipping Service, when he found a story about people being harmed by a UFO encounter in Venezuela. As he read he noted the close parallel to the famous Cash-Landrum radiation case of December 29, 1980, near Huffman, Texas. The story in the August 20, 1982 issue of TAL CUAL Magazine, published in Buenos Aires, Argentina, describes how Maria Elena Suarez, her grandson Gonzalo, and a friend called Susana encountered a huge flaming UFO and were injured. This writer believes the story is a complete Wanderer, Continued lead to strange interpretations of what one sees (particularly by people who believe no atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima). 3. \"If Mr. Wanderer wishes to find psychological explanations of UFO abduction scenarios, he has a responsibility to show exactly hoiuthey arise.\" I am not clear why someone seeking a psychological explanation for \"abductions\" is required to supply detailed rationales, while Mr. Rogo and others asserting these \"abductions\" are \"real\" need provide no hard evidence or even rational explanations. In any case, what I could do, and did, was to agree with Mr. Rogo's observation in the book that additional psychological information is needed in such cases, and to wonder why he did not obtain this sort of material for this book. Incidentally, Mr. Rogo calls me a \"proto-ufologist,\" and I don't know whether that's a criticism or a compliment. The 'tone of his sentence containing that word sounds negative to me, but my dictionary lists \"proto-\" as meaning \"first in time\" and \"first in status.\"d 16 fabrication, because the minute details are too identical to the Texas case; while major details such as date, location, and where the victims live have been omitted. TAL CUAL quotes Maria as saying: \"My God, save us! That thing is on fire and it's coming over us! It's getting closer! We're burning! God help us!\" It goes on to describe how Maria appeared to be hypnotized as she relived the incident. During a real hypnosis session conducted by Dr. Leo Sprinkle of the University of Wyoming, Mrs. Vickie Landrum, the grandmother in the Texas case, made similar statements! She implored God to help them. She said \"it's burning, the whole thing is burning. There is fire coming out the bottom.\" The description of the approaching UFO is also the same. A large luminous object clearly visible in the sky, came in at treetop level and emitted reddish tongues of flame down towards the highway. The South American story tells how one of the women got out of the car, running. In Texas, Betty Cash did get out of the car and walked towards the object. Vickie Landrum shouted for her to return, saying \"Come back to the car. Don't walk toward it.\" The Venezuelan grandson, Gonzalo, five years old, wanted to run away because of fear, but was held tightly to prevent his escape. Vickie Landrum feared her grandson Colby, age 7, would run away terror-stricken into the night, so she held him close to her as they cowered in the front seat of the car. The aftereffects of the event are also similar. Susana was said to have horrible burns and had to be admitted to a special clinic for treatment. Her symptoms included loss of skin, diarrhea, nausea, and headaches. In Texas, Betty Cash had all of these symptoms and more. A final statement in TAL CUAL credited a \"cardiologist\" with stating that all three people had symptoms of radiation poisioning; when it is very doubtful that people would see a cardiologist for treatment of burns. In Texas, Betty Cash was hospitalized and treated by a cardiologist — a doctor she knew before the event. The Venezuelan story points up the need to be critical when examining reports of UFO encounters. Reliable details are a necessity. Bob Pratt and John Schuessler plan to market a book containing all the details of the Cash- Landrum case with the intent of helping other people in a similar situation and dispelling rumors caused by fake events such as the one in Venezuela.

I would like to applaud its thoroughness and professionalism throughout. I think Mr. Oberg has made an important discovery as well as a good underlying .point regarding professionalism in UFO research. It's true that investigative practices might be less than thorough, but I feel the problem does not lie in the integrity or capabilities of various UFO researchers, but in the hands of those persons responsible for severing UFO research from an accepted scientific subject of study. • Your guess is as good as mine when trying to figure out the reason behind that policy, but the resulting problem is that research is left up to individuals and organizations who must fund their own investigations and make their own time within already existing, and often busy schedules. I get the impression that Mr. Oberg has an attitude towards the failings of these researchers and writers who are at least trying to explore and expose UFO activity. It is this that I cannot understand. What is behind the need to point so critically? Mr. Oberg's attitude problem clearly jams him up from breaking through beyond the surface layer of the problem; that is, whether or not a specific UFO event actually occurred, and is, by all means, \"bona-fide unidentified.\" Although this is the first and most crucial aspect of investigating any specific case, the solution is not always secured at this point. We have yet to discover and clearly explain the origin and the reason behind the truly strange close range encounters. His own fatal limits are the very plagues that cripple adequate research. Maybe he should take out his frustrations on the rightful cause of situations he deems less than impeccable so that we may someday launch a full scale scientific probe into the underlying and challenging truths of the UFO enigma. However, in consideration of the obvious official need to keep UFOs unofficial, it is probably unlikely that Mr. Oberg will ever relieve his frustrations. Judith Starchild Check, Va. Editor Error Editor, I believe you inaccurately stated the skeptical position in your recent editorial associated with the NOVA show (No. 175, Sept. 1982). You wrote that skeptics believe that all UFO reports are \"readily explainable.\" I, for one, have never believed, said, or written that. Instead, my point is that even prosaic stimuli will result in a small fraction of unsolved — and for all practical purposes unsoluable (by human means) — cases, and no extraordinary hypothesis is needed to account for the existence of some unsolved UFO cases. That is, the undisputed existence of unsolved cases cannot, in my view, be taken as proof for the existence of extraordinary stimuli. Proof of such existence must be pursued in other ways, which I have suggested elsewhere. James Oberg Dickinson, Texas (Editor's reply: I concede that the skeptical position was oversimplified in my brief editorial. It would have been more accurate to say that skeptics \"...tend to believe all sightings are explainable in 'prosaic' terms, many readily, some not so readily.\" As Mr. Oberg indicates, he assumes that all sightings have \"prosaic stimuli.\" I can't imagine what evidence other than sightings — preferably, of course, with instrumented data — could supply \"proof for the existence of extraordinary stimuli.\" In my view, we already have ample proof; not of what \"they\" are, but that \"they\" are.)

Considering the unanimous acceptance and co-operation of the representatives attending the 1982 UFO Summit Conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on July 5, 1982, it is disturbing to read the article titled \"APRO's Position on Unity\" in Volume 31, No. 2. It was enlightening to observe that both William L. Moore, a member of the APRO Board of Directors, and Richard W. Heiden, Assistant Editor of the A.P.R.O. Bulletin, attended the conference and paid their own expenses. Since neither gentleman was authorized to speak for the APRO Board of Directors, except for a position statement, the article referred to above clearly enunciates APRO's lack of cooperation. The derogatory remarks made about CUFOS and MUFON are unwarranted and that of a polemicist.
