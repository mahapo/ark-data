The writer made his fourth trip to the site on Au~ust 8, 1972 accompanying a scientist from California to gather more sanl?les of the ring soil for additional extensive study. I will not, in the following report, go into great detail in de- scribing the sighting as this irlfor~ation has appekred in numerous publications, including SKYLOOK. ke will have 2 look at the various bits of evidence gathered over the past 9 months. Ps the Iielphos report is 103 pages in length and not yet complete, the information must be presented in a most condensed form. The report is based on four trips to the site--December 4, 1971, January 11, iQrch 113 and kup.ust 8, 1972. Al\\iliU!L REkCTICiii: The witness wes accompariied by a srriall dog. It was noted that the dog was very quiet during the observation--did not bark or try to leave the area. 'lhat evening end the following day the dog would not return to the ring. The dog was observed by Sheriff b.nlow 2nd others as he ran into a barn and 2 fence. The dog had elwzys spent the night outside, prior to the lending--since then he has dsm- aged two screen doors in his attempts to enter the Johnson home stid will not stay outside at night. The Johnson sheep were bellowing loudly during the observztion of the hovering object, but did not move during that period. After the incident, they jumped fences for a week. As of late July the sheep born since the event have given premature birth to lambs which have not lived. Numerous physical effects on the witnesses have been reported. Mrs. Johnson, upon seeing the glowing soil, rubbed her hand on the soil surface and immediately noted a numbing effect in her fingers. She rubbed her hand against her leg and that portion of the leg wss numbed. The numbing effect in the fingers lasted for several w~eks; the numbed portion of her leg is still ih effect. f4r. Johnson also touched the soil and noted a numbing sensation in his fingers, but this passed away in a few days. The primary witness, Ronnie, suffer- ed considerable eye irritation for a few dsys and complained of headaches during that time. PHYSICAL EVIDEJtCE AT TH6 SITE: At the lending site there wzs found an 8-foot glowing ring of soil. Portions of nearby trees also glowed with the glowing effect lasting for four nights. b. color photograph of the glowing ring was taken by Lrs. Johnson 8, minutes after the object had ascended. lhe ring width is an irrep,ular 12 to 1g inches; the effect is wider on its eastern edge. It is interesting to note that the wind was blowing across the ring west to east--could it be thst the wind acted as a spreeding agefit? The ring soil will not absorb water; plants will not grow in it. A white fibrous material is found in the ring soil but not in the soil in the center or in the surrounding soil. 1 have heated tne normal soil, using v~rious methods, including a microwave oven; the white material is not there. The dryin@, effect ~nd the white material was found to a depth of 14 incnes on Decenber 4th; it could be found at a depth of only four inches on Lugust 8. ~n2lysis of tile bilite material is now under way.

A tree branch 3.5 inches in diameter is hsnginf; ne:!r tne western edge of the ring, broken at a point 8.5 feet above the pround. No large imp~ct marks were found on the limb, however an area was noted where the bsrk had been peeled bsck; this zrea is one inch square. The flight path is to the south of the site.

'3. 3 YE: 1\" number of questions have been brought to my attentioil over the past months and I feel thst we have good answers for tliern. Co~ild tlie ring have been caused by lightning? To answer that question, I contacted an expert on lightning, Dr. M. A. Urnan, Deprt~i~ent of Electrical hngineering, University of Florida. I de- scribed tile rlng to him 2nd received the following reply: \"I know of no lightni!~,r phenomenon that could 1s ve produced the effects described in your lctter.\" The sky was clear at the time of the observation, but there !lad been a thunderstorm 18 hours earlier. How do we know that tile ring was not there for an undetermined period of time before the report? 'Lhen the Sheriff arid others visited the site November 3, 1971 the soil wzs almost white; a photograph taken that day shows this clearly. Ll~en 1 visited the site 32 days later, the effect was bright but had diminished visibly. The ring was quickly returning to its normal stzte wrlen seen on January 11, 1972 and again Narch 18, 1972. The I-.ugust 8th visit proved this beyond any doubt. The ring was visible but only in sinall isolsted spots. The drying effect ad the wiiite materisl was found to E depth of only 4 inches as compared with the 14 inch depth of December 4. 1 feel quite sure that the ring was indeed fresh at the time of the sighting. I would not at this time hazard a guess as to the cause of the ring. It is extremely dif- ficult to imagine a drying effect of this magnitude which would not produce steam as it dried the damp soil. The boy was asked repeatedly if he could see steam while the object was at the site. He ststed over and over again that he could only see a glow extending from the base of the object to the ground. I contacted a scientist at a south- ern university, presenting the report for his consideration as he (Continued on next page) 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"had published an article in Science based on his work in weed control with ultra high-frequency electromagnetic fields. I received a two page reply and quote in part:lliYicrowaves in the range 100-10,000 9 megahertz at power densities above 100 watt seconds /C1~1 can cause plant symptoms similar to burning and can definitely csuse dehydrai tion. Wilting and browning of soybeans (Van Horne, Iowa trzce case) occurring very quickly after treatment, csn be caused by microwaves in the range mentioned. Rapid drying with the green color retained often occurs with microwave exposures. The multi-colored lignts, flowing of soil and trees and numbing sensations, could not have been csused by microwaves.' All of these phenomena can be induced by energy in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum--for example, electricity can cause numbing sensations, and light can be received by biological photorecptors, e. g., chlorophyll, and later re-radiated at different wave length. Bicrowaves can cause breaking of trees and tree branches if the water contained therin changes to steam rapidly. I hsve observed this with smaller plants. lri s mm: ry, sorne of the effects you describe could be attributed to exposure to rel- atively high power densities of microwaves; other could not. i.11 the biological effects describec could conceivably be csused by ener2)y in some portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, but no one areE co~ld account for all the effects described.\" SOIL ANALYSIS: The soil anslysis is not done overnight; it tikes a good deal of time and money.

Reports and comments by the Press ranged from tongue-in-cheek to ser- ious, charges of hoax, speculation that the creature may have been dropped by a space ship, claims that it is an \"alienn from another planet, comperisons to other strange creatures--Nessy, Big Foot and others. Personally, your editor does not see any relation between the Louisiana creature and UFOs (no surprise to those knowing our conservative views) but there are others who do and we respect their views. khatever YOUR opinion is, we believe you'll find a report of No Mo interesting reading. The best factual rer;ort, in our opinion, gppeared in the \"Centralia Sentinel,'t Centrblia, Ill., July 24, and was given in connection with a report of the MJFON skywatcn and picnic held at Carlyle Lake. Yesterday members of the hidwest UFO Network got the full rbn-down on the series of monster siehtings which have attracted nationwide attention to the area around Louisiana, lhissouri, where two children reported seeing a tall, hairy monster on July 11. Although the children's report has received more publicity, John Schuessler of 0fFa11011, Ilissouri told the assembled picnickers that a similar monster was seen at Quiver Hiver State Park, near Troy, on June 30. The Troy sighting, plus two other reports from 1971, now lend more credence to the Harrison children's story, which has been regcrded as a hoax by some. Schuessler, who had just returned from the Quiver River Park, gave the following account of the earlier sighting. On June 30, two young men were fishing in the Quiver River at the foot of a steep bluff. One of the men looked upstream and saw a large hairy individual wad- ing across the stream, about 150 feet away. As he watched, the creature, which had been up to his armpits in the water, emerged on the other side; and he saw that it was not a hippie as he had originally thought, but a large hairy animal with sloping shoulders. Both he and his companion took off through the woods and immediately reported the incident to the park ranger. About five minutes earlier, another couple who were fishing 250 feet upstream, heard \"grunts and groans, like a man in painw and were so unnerved by the sounds that they stopped fishing also and hastily left the woods. They too reported the incident, and a search party was organized. However, nothing was found except a large 3-toed footprint; and no one took a plaster cast of the im- pression. The sighting of the monster at Quiver River Pbrk may be related to the Louisiana case, which halter Andrus, MUFON Director, says is \"definitely not a hoax generated by children.'' kndrus had just re- turned from Louisiana, after interviewing the Edgar Harrison family; and he displayed a sketch done by Doris Hsrrison, 15, one of the children who saw the creature. From the drawing, it looked quite similar to the Quiver Hiver animal. The monster was first seen by Terry Harrison, 8, when he was out in the backyard which is near a heavily wooded part of town. Accord- ing to Terry's story, the creature was about 7 feet fall, covered with hair and had no distinguishable facial features. It was carry- ing a small black dog umler its arm; and the dog was bleeding. (Continued on next page) 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"Terry became so frightened,\" said Andrus, that he ran into the house. At about the same time, his sister, Doris, looked out the bathroom window, saw the creature retreating into'the brush and be- came hysterical. Since Mrs. Harrison was too frightened to stay in the house, she and some of her nine children slept at the family restaurant, while the men kept a two-night vigil hoping to spot the monster. Both nights, reported Andrus, the men heard howls and sounds of something crashing through the underbrush, but they were unable to spot the creature with their flashlights. In trailing the beast, however, they noticed a sickening odor, \"like a dead horse,\" which was so nauseating that one of the Harri- son boys became ill. The following night, July 12, a group of hunt- ers and 15 dogs turned out to assist in the search. But although the howls continued, the dogs refused to go into the woods. Meanwhile, continued Andrus, Mrs. Harrison was stillzraid to return home, but on July 14, following a Penecostal church service at the Harrison home, she consented to remain in the house. A short time later, blood-curdling screams were heard coming from the woods; and the entire Harrison family, numbering 11 people,.piled into tileir 1968 Plymouth and sped into town, just as 50 more neighbors arrived for the nightly watch. The following night 150 armed citizens showed up at the Hzrrison home ready to offer their assistance, but left at the request of the county sheriff who remained himself through the night without hearing anything. - The sighting of the Missouri Monster, or Mo Mo as John Schuessler has dubbed it, may be related to an incident which was published in SAGA magazine last year. Schuessler is presently trying to find the two young women who reported seeing a hairy monster while they were picnicking near Louisiana a year ago. According to the article, Schuessler said, the animal came out of the woods, frightening the girls, who locked themselves in their car. While they watched,the monster devoured their picnic lunch; and was finally scared away after they repeatedly blew the horn. Another similar incident was reported to Scheussler on Friday night following his appearance on a. St. Louis television program. k woman caller told Scheussler that a year ago, her husband had been fishing near their cabin at Foley, Missouri, when he was terrified by a large shaggy creature which came up out of the water. \"We've been teasing him about it,\" the lady told Scheussler \" but now we're not so sure.\" f End of Wentralia Sentinel\" According to many news clippings, people living in the Louisiana area kept children at home and locked their homes at night. With so many \"lookingw for a strange creature, it follows that many and varied reports were made to the news media. , One man reported the creature walked up behind his small foreign car and lifted it up. He said the hairy black monster dropped the car and ran away. Two young boys hiking told police they saw the creature, resembling a bear, standing in the woods. They didn't get a good look, they said, because the monster growled and they sterted running. Shelby Ward, chief of the Louisiana Police department said no bears have been sighted in the county in recent years. However, your editor heard on a Sedalia, Mo. TV news report that a woman in Louisi- ana reported seeing a brown bear near her garbage cans, just two blocks from the latest creature report. (Continued on next page), 6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"A plaster c~st was made of footprints, believed to be those of the creature, and described as being nine by seven inches with four or five toes coming out of a palm-like base. Lawrence Curtis, of the Oklahoma City zoo, examined the casts and said they are fakes \"and not very good fakes, at that.\" A woman reported she was aware of something walking past her win- dow and she went outside, but saw nothing. She did notice a rank smell permeating the air. Illinois State Police thought they might have cracked the case when two troopers reported seeing a green, long-tailed \"somethingn disappesring into the woods near New Canton late July 27. An inves- tigation netted authorities 12 young men and a dragon costume. Police later said there was no connection between the New Canton dragon and ~Ioi\"10. The Flh entered the czse when bloMo was reported sighted near a priv~te landing field close to Louisiana and again at Haerr Field at Taylor. The FAA told eirport officials and pilots to watch for any unidentified object which might have brought HOMO to earth. \"In our profession you have to check everything,\" said Philip Maxted, an offlcial at the huincy, Ill. flight station. \"The general opinion is that the monster is a joke, but one never knows.\" On bednesday, July 25, an early morning jogger in Cairo, Ill., more than 200 miles down river from Louisiana, reported he had seen a tall, white monster. James Dale, police commissioner, and his men checked and found nothing. After this, Dale said, anyone reporting a monster will heve to submit to a breath analysis test to determine whether he has been drinking. On Thursday night, July 26, East Peoria, Ill. police said \"two reliable citizensn reported seeing MoMo. \"He had long, grey U-shaped ears, a red mouth with sharp teeth, thumbs with long second joints and looked llke a cross between an ape and a cave man,\" they said. ke like the cartoon by John Fischetti in \"The Chicago Daily*Newsm showing a shaggy creature standing against a background of steaming garbage, foul stream, and black smoke pouring from factory smoke stacks. The creature says, \"People saying I smell bad--THEY should talk.\" (Thanks, ivir. hiller) To conclude, we have another article from the \"Centralia Sentineln pointing out that MoMo, if found is wanted by the Internal Revenue Service, the Selective Service Administration and the Bureau of Immi- gration snd Naturalization. \"It\" will have to file a tax return; if between 18 and 35 years of age, register with Selective Service; and if an alien, will have to deel with the Bureau of Naturalization and Immigration. If MdMo is an alien from another planet, he could be subject to deportation--if NASA will help with transportation. Well, no wonder MoMo is looking for a better hiding place.

Ye Ed."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Hoax Suspected in UFO Photos Editor's Note: In the May 1972 issue of SKYLOOK we , along with other ufozines, published a report of a \"UFO Photographed Over Mart, Texasn from the \"Waco News-Tribunen and the \"Mart Heraldt1 whose photo- graphs showed a saucer-shaped, domed object above power lines. Data-Net (7900 Harvard Drive, Ben Lomond, Calif., 95005) Jo Clark's fine ufozine, also published reports, but did some follow-up investi- gating (another reason it IS a ''finen magazine) and we quote from Jerry Johnson's report in the June issue of Data-Net: 27 May 1972 - After several hours of interviewing Les Roll of Mart, Texas and examining his hotographs of a disk-shaped object made on 27 Feb 72 (see DATA-NET 8 57, p. 18, and #59, ~.7), author and UFO re- searcher Ray Stanford came away convinced that the sighting was a hoax. Stanford asked me to convey his feelings to DATA-NET, which had given Roll's sighting much publicity in an article by Nr. Tommy R. Blann appearing in Report #59, May 1972. Ray Stanford became interested in this sighting report after some personal communication from Tommy B~M, and Les Roll was invited to Stanford's home in Austin. Roll brbght with him the original Polaroid prints of photographs he took from his porch of an object alleged to be 500 feet across and from 5 miles distant in the first photo to not closer than 1 and 1/2 miles in the later shots. A \"man\" is supposed to be visible within a \"domen on top of this object, although if the object's size and ddstance estimates were correct, this figure of a man would have to be enormous. Stanford reports that the first thing he noticed about the witness' pictures was that they had been cut apart with scissors. The top 1/2 to 2/3 of one was missing. Another had its top cut off as well, plus the two sides of the print were cut at such an angle that the remainig portion was more narrow at the top than at the bottom. All of the photos had been cut in this manner immediately above the image of the nUFO.n Stanford believes this was done to hide the support for a wire or string holding a small model disk. There is no atmospheric diffusion in any of the photos (as there would be if the object were any distance away from the camera as re- ported by Roll). The lines are sharp, the shadows a dark black. The photographs, said Stanford, show an object apparently not more than 8 feet away. The photos also reveal an inconsistency with Roll's story of stepping off the porch while taking them. Power lines in the back- ground of the later shots are at such an angle that the photographer must have stepped up onto something. The plastic dome of the \"space shipn is almost unmistakably food wrap suspended by a bent wire. Even after he had taken the photographs, Roll had told reporters that he did not believe in flying saucers, and had not read books on the subject. But in Ray Stanford's home, Roll compared his experience with those of George Adamski, Dan Fry etc. and exhibited some knowledge of UFO lore, particularly the contactee aspect. Ray Stanford also interviewed Tommy Blam, who sent the reports on Roll's sighting to DATA-NET. Stanford said that Blann would be \"predis- posed to accept this type of claim as genuine, \"due to what he describes as a \"strong belief in cases of telepathic communication with space- men, witnesses who claim repeated close-range sightings etc.n It came out that a power failure \"exactly 25 minutesn after the sighting (see Blannts report in DATA-NET #59, P. 7) could be placed no sooner than several hours after the alleged incident, and no connection with UFOs (Continued on next page) 8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"is apparent. The \"animal reaction1# mentioned also seems to have little connection with any UFO incident. Significantly, no other person in the area on this Sunday morning saw the huge object, as it \"zig-zagged\" in the sky long enough for Les Roll to reenter his house, get his camera, shoot and tear-off the three disputed photographs. The other central-Texas sightings mentioned in Blann's report have no connection with the photograph case, and just might be genuine. No photographic evidence of UFO activity can be accepted unless it is supported by the integrity of the witnesses involved. Ray Stznford has interviewed the people directly involved with this case, and I am reporting hie observations and opinions. Your Assistant Control re- serves opinion on the matter until given an opportunity to examine the original photographs. I do feel at this time that $2.00 for one of the copies being sold by Mr. Blann would be a waste. UFO in Wisconsin Reported by Bress and Radio Shawano, Wis., July 29, 1972--County authorities in Shawano and Waupaca Counties reported sighting unidentified flying objects and one deputy sheriff in Shawano County watched a glowing ball high in the air for more than 30 minutes according to his desk sergeant today.

Observed by three children, it was reported to hoger Leyers, an associate of the St. Louis UFO study group; and it was learned later that 13 telephone cclls were made to radio station KXOh by others reporting the object. Melissa Hamilton, 9, Nancy Dunham, 10, and Jackie Purdom, g, were at Melissa's home (749 Regina) when they saw the objects. An object descended from the north, then hovered and appesred to rotate slowly as it launched separately five smaller objects. The large object was described by the children as \"th6 size and shape of a football in the sky\" and gold in color. The sc~aller objects, round and white, appeared to be about 1/12th the size of the large one. After hovering for a few seconds, the objects all left at the sane time--the large one going straight up with a loud, cracking sound; one smaller object going north, another south and three east in the direction of the observers, but on a rising plane, so they disappeared before reaching the children. The children immediately reported what they had seen to Eleycrs, who then contacted \\rim. F. Christian, Sr., a IWFON Stzte section Director. Scanning the sky with lox binoculars revealed only the contrail of a high flying SAC bomber not the plane itself. The sky was clear, temperature in the high ACTS; the sun wss setting and there was no wind at ground or tree top level. A call was made to the newsroomof radio station KXOK at g:55 and it was learned two other calls had been received, reporting the UFO seen from 2 ball field about a mile and half from the children's observation point. On the following Monday another check was made at the radio st~tion and the caller told that a total of 13 cells i~rl been received Sat- urday evening regarding tne sighting; but as no xmes had been taken, the investigator was unable to obtain their confirmation 2nd pcssible additional description of the objects seen.

As nearly as they can recall, the first happening was in May. It was about one o'clock in the morning when Mrs. X was awakened from her sleep by the strange action of the lights on the electric fence charger. On leaving her bed to investigate she found the entire area was bathed-in a brilliant orange-white light apparently emitted by an object located almost directly over the house as it moved in from the northwest, then took a position due east of the house and hovered there approximtely 10-15 minutes. It then moved due south of the house, hovered again for about five minutes, then simply vanished. During the entire incident Mrs. X never actually saw the object itself, only the intensely brilliant light. The next morning Mrs. X awoke with a fuzzy recollection of the in- cident, as if she had dreamed it. But when she went outside the house, she discovered some amazing evidence that quickly dispelled any notion that the incident had been a dream. There is a treeline northwest of the house (the trees runriing east- west) and whatever caused the brilliant light had burned a path through the trees. All the leaves on the trees in the path wilted and died, as if they had been scalded. Later these trees grew new leaves and are still growing today. The same fate fell to some trees near a hog pen east of the house. Two of these trees died and a third has died since. That morning the children missed the school bus because, as they discovered, all clocks and watches in the house were five minutes slow. but the next discovery the X family made proved to be the most important, as they saw the matter. One of their brood sows had vanished from the hog pen--the same pen over which the lighted object had hovered for at least 10 minutes. The X's did not try to suggest that possible occupants of a UFO had lifted the soy, but there was no evidence to indicate the'hog had broken out of the pen and the X family cannot believe that anyone could have caught and removed it without causing alarm. The second incident occurred less than a month later. Mr. X and a companion were in some timber northwest of the house where they had a close range sighting of a hat-shaped UFO. lrihile not close en0up.h to judge exact distance and size, they were near enough to observe considerable detail of - the object . It had portholes which were illuminated from within by brilliant white lights and there were red and white running lights on each end. When first sighted the craft was moving west and to the north of the observers. It stopped, hovered for a few moments, then retraced its path to the east and disappeared in the trees. Mr. X and his com- panion noticed that the craft emitted a high-pitched whining sound. Mrs. X did not see this craft, but noted its presence when it obviously flew quite near the house. She said the house shook like a sonic boom had hit it and she also heard a high-pitched sound. When looked out an open window and felt some \"invisible substance\" float in the window and on to her arms. This caused a burning and tingling sensation, and she also became quite di-zzy and to sit down for a few minutes until the adverse effects passed away.

I have seen many jets at that distance, so I know the speed. \"The point is, airplanes never fly that close to our building--and besides, this mysterious red light did something no aircraft could do.

Allen Hynek a few months ago and telling him \"that if there really were something to UFOs, I would think it about time, after 20 years of writing about them, that I would encounter one.

Kansas Arkansas Gazette, July 18, 1972--For several months the western town ofDighton, Kans.(pop.lD050) has been visited by a recurring unidenti- fied flying object--a fiery red cluster of bright lights seen by the chief of police, several policemen and a n~mber of citizens. But the community remains relatively unconcerned. Police Chief M. R. Shelton described the object as a \"round, red- orange and white light * * bright as a cluster of lights on a foot- ball'field.\" It hovers about 300 to 500 feet high, usually 10 miles west of town. \"We didn't think much about it at first,\" Shelton said. \"We thought it might be the military taking infrared pictures of the area to check feedlot runoff.\" Shelton said the object would remain stationary until an investigat- ing officer radioed another car about it. It then begins to move away. \"Everytime we transmit, it moves.\" Shelton saw it about two months ago and followed it with his car at speeds of up to 100 miles an hour. He said it would run parallel to his czr, or slightly ahead of it. The UFO has been sighted severaltimes a month, usually between 11 p.m. and the early morning hours, since late February.

Two mernbws of this group left their vehicle uith an intention to investi~ate what this object was and what it was do- ing there. However, their efforts proved fruitless because the flying object aimed a powerful light ray at them. They felt compelled to return to their car and depart.

The members of this group had much more to relate, but due to their excite- ment and due to their depression they were unwilling to reveal all the details of that memorable night.

(Signed) Zivko Zivkovich ***** Dallas Offers Key.. of City to UFO Pilot Twenty-two years ago then mayor ballace Savage, the Chamber of Commerce of Dallas, Texas, and the city's Aviation Department joined in announcing that the key to the city, honorary citizenship and a re- served parking place at Love Field would be given to the first flying saucer pilot to land in Dallas. It included all-expense housing in the finest hotels, free meals limousine service, entertainment and genuine western hats for the pilot and his crew. The city's offer was made after a rash of sightings in the area during the late 1940's. At the same time officials of the State Pair of Texas offered a $50,000 reward to anyone producing an authentic interplanetary flying saucer. According to a recent article in the \"Dallas Times Herald,\" there have been no takers altho UFOs have been reported in 1952, 1953 and 1967. (Credit: Capt. Dave T. Ozame) Editor's Note: Seems as if some of our so-called contactees who profess to be on intimate terms with some of the Space Brothers Out Yodder would pass the word along -= after all, that's a pretty good - offer, and LaHoody from Venus could probably use one of those western hats.

By Lucius Farish The weekly tabloids continue to feature UFO material on a fairly regular basis. The NATIONAL ENQUIHER of Aug. 20 ran exclusive inter- views with Soviet astronomers who discussed their search for signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. The Aug. 27 ENCLUIHLR contained a feature on well-known Australian UFO researcher, Michael Hervey, plus a short item on Dr. David Saundersf computer study of UFO re- ports. The NATIONAL TATTLER, beginning with the Aug. 20 issue, is present- ing a series of articles excerpted from Dr. J. Allen Hynekfs new book, THE UFO EXPERIENCE. This series will probably continue for several weeks. The NATIONAL NEWS EXPLOITER has articles by Hayden C. Hewes in its issues of A . 13 (UFOs and Bigfoot-like creatures at Vader, Wash.) and Aug. 20 ? re-hash of the \"Snippy\" case). An article by Stanton Friednan and B. Ann Slate in the Sept. issue of FATE provides a very good summary of \"winged disc\" reports from Ceylon. A two-part series on the \"Bermuda Triangle\" is found in the Aug. and Sept. issues of SAGA. hritten by researcher iiichard Winer, it contains some new material concerning the \"classicu mysteries of the BT area, as well as reports of recent happenings. UFOs are mentioned only as a possible answer to some of the ship/plane disappearances. The Aug. SAGA also contains an interesting article on possijle BT life by science writer Kenneth Gatland. In my review of Bruce Cathie's book, HkRhONlC 695, in last rrronth's column, I gave the price as $4.75. This was in i-ustralian currency, as I did noc know the precise exchange rate. Later word from the boo& publishers indicates thiit the price in U. S. dollars is $6.25, which includes postage, handling etc. Brad Steiger is undoubtedly the most prolific writer on things un- known that this country has seen in quite some time. Une of nis latest offerings is a paperback entitled SThi.hCE. D1SAPPEI:rlkl'dCLS. In recounting the stories--many of them familiar--of people, ships, planes etc. who have mysteriously vanished, he speculates on such \"answers\" as UFO kidnappers and other-dimensional vortices. Zion~e of the cases quoted Ere rather questionable in nature, such as the rLuch- discussed Oliver Lerch (or Larch) case which allegedly took place neer South Bend, Ind. in 1890. Research into police and newspaper files has . disclosed no evidence of such an occurrance. However, even hith its flaws, STRAKE DISAPPEAilARCES makes .,interestin rezding. Published by Lancer Books (1560 Broadwby, N. Y., Pi. Y. 1003 ) , it sells for 95$ (plus 106 postage, if ordered by mail). % Arthur C. Clarke is a brilliant writer on all manner of space sub- jects--except UFOs! When it comes to subject, Clerke's ignor- ance of the massive UFO evidence becomes abundantly clear. In his - latest compendium, REPURT ON PLANET THfiLL, he repeats the sene old tired phrases sbout \"natural phenomenau, misperceptions etc. It is really a shame, as a man of Clarke's talent and intelligence would be a huge asset to UFO research if only he would recogriize the serious- ness of the subject. On other matters involving space and space travel, he excels, as the present book proves. It is a collection of articles and talks, r~nging in subject matter from Mars to extraterres- trial life to the Clarke/Kubrick movie classic, \"2001: A Space Ody- ssey.\" kell worth rezding, the book is published by Harper ic How, 49 East 33rd St., N.

The skywatch began at dusk Saturday nlght wlth John Preisack, of St. Louis, making an inform1 talk on as- tronow. Walter Breville, also of St. Louis, provided an &inch reflector tele- scope for a closer look at the sky. Shortwave commnications were set up around the Lake 181th Bill Armstrong, Kathleen bier, Carol Armstrong, Icke Mellinger, Cliff Palmberg, Walt A ndrus, Clarence Dargie and other volunteers manning the posts. While no UFOs were seen, skills in tracking exercise were improved--the shltaneous fix on a passing object from three points making it possible to calculate speed and direction of movement. The picnic and informal take were held on Sunday. All were pleased in having Lucius Farish, of Plumerville, Ark., present, as his name is known anywhere UFOs are mentioned and he has long been recognized as an authority on that subject. He had everyone's full attention as he spoke on *Physical and Mental Phenomena Sometimes Associated with UFO Sightings.' Physlcal phenomena includes interrupt- ion of telephone calls; falls of Lve creatures or miscellaneous objects or .space grassm from the sky; landing traces; strange sounds; animal mutilations; strange disappearances; unusual animals; strange clouds and teleportations and time lapses. Psychic phenomena have included mental impressiana or premonitions, apparent telepathic comnication and strange dreams. Examples were given and Mr. Farish pointed out that, since they do seem to be associated wlth UFO sightlngs at times, we have to consider them as possibly related. He admitted that the inplicatlms are fantastic, but this should not keep Us from investigating as fully as possible. His own conclusion is that there is far more lnvolved in UFOs than simply visi- tors from other planets. Everyone brought boxes and baskets for the picnic tables; but Rosetta and Dick Holmes, of Carlyle, who have hosted the affair since its first gathering, again went all out in providing the extras--baked ham, noodles (Rosie's noodles are now famous in WNN-land), green beans, slaw and lemonade for all. John Schuessler, of St. Louis, served as leader for an informal afternoon pro- gram and taLlts were made by Walter H. Andms, Ted Phillips, Bill Chistun, Mrs. H. E. Hohs and Clarence Dargie. MoMo, the Louisiana Monster, was a topic of discussion (see article on Mono elsewhere). On the llghter side, all enjoyed two songs--\"Unidentified Flying Object Bluesn and \"Hey, Mr. Flying Saucer Mann by Brad and BNC~ Hearle, of Cisne, Ill. The interesting talks, the good food and tins for \"visitingn left everyone feeling glad they came and leaving with plans to return next year. This report was written from letters from Carol Anstrong, staff reporter, and others present. Mrs. Holmes has asked us to extend her thanks to all who helped make tne day a success by their cooperation and assistance in planning and parti- cipation--and we feel sure all present would like for us to give Rosie and Dick \"a big hand\" too.
