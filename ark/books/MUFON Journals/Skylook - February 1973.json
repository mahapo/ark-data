The majority of the personnel associated with Mrs. Epper- son have already joined MUFON and are subscribing to SKYLOOK. Idabel. with her daughter. Marilyn, resides at 343 North Citrus Avenue, Los Ange- les, Calif., 90036; telephone AC 213 933-0593- 1 t is a pleasure to welcome Idabel, a very gracious lady and enthusiastic UFO researcher, to MUFON. We would like to acknowledge the tireless efforts of Mrs. Charles (Ann) Druffel. 257 Sycamore Glen, Pasadena, C a lif., 91105, a colleague of Idabel and a MUFON member, for her work in organizing the SKYNET program as a means of tracking UFOs in the same two counties. In order to strengthen MUFON ! s UFO research into this perplexing phe- nomenon, two more consultants have volunteered their services. Adrian Vance, writer-photographer and photo analyst, 7431 Del Zuro Drive, Holly- wood, Calif., 90046, has been appointed a Consultant in Photography. He has written and produced over 150 educational film strips for various companies, including Universal Internetional and the Encyclopaedia Brit- tannica. He is a Contributing Editor to Peterson's PHOTOGRAPHIC magazine. Their January, 1973 t issue carried Vance 1 s very fine photo analysis of the Oregon UFO photo made on Nov. 22, 1966, by a scientist on the west coast who holds a Ph.D. in Biochemistery and is a consultant to a major U.S. corporation. (See SKYLOOK article in this issue for story.) Ron Westrum, Ph. D., Professor of Sociology at Eastern Michigan State University, has been selected as MUFON's Consultant in Sociology. He resides at 555 East William, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 4#10#. Ron attended the 1972 Midwest UFO Conference in Quincy, Illinois, on June 17, 1972, and had an opportunity to evaluate the work being done by MUFON. He will be applying his expertise to the second edition of our \"Field Investigator's Manual,\" to not only up-date its material, but to improve its effectiveness as a tool in UFO sighting interviews and investigation. Ron will not only be providing consulting service to MUFON, but he is already active as a Field Investigator working directly with Robert L. Stinson, State- Section Director for the counties surrounding Detroit, Michigan, Bob Stinson is proud to announce the selection of three other very competent Field Investigators by naming David Stupple, Ph. D., Ypsilanti; Arthur • M. Spinella, Editor/Reporter for Ward's Automotive Report, of Belleville; and Fred R. Varner, Madison heights. We are proud to announce that Jerry L. Sievers, 140 Ramsey Road, Vin- cennes, Indiana, will be the State-Section Director for Knox, Daviess, and Sullivan Counties. Jerry formerly worked as a UFO team with Francis L. Ridge, now a State-Section Director in Hillsboro, Illinois, Lou Farish, State Director for Arkansas, has appointed Larry U. Gilli- han as the State-Section Director for the northeast Arkansas counties of Craighead, Greene, Clay, Mississippi and Poinsett. Larry, a pro- fessional musician, lives in Bono, Arkansas (P. 0.

Dargie, a retired Air Force master sergeant, a member of the Midwest UFO Network and a lecturer on the Bible and ancient civilizations and UFOs. He told Lou Farish about this at the Carlyle Lake picnic last summer, and Lou asked him to write an account for SKYLOOK. We thank both of you, Mr. Dargie's report follows, in his own words. This is an account of the disappearance of en F-94C jet fighter- inter- ceptor which has puzzled me for many years. I have personal knowledge of the circumstances because I was directly involved in the resultant inves- tigation. (Just for the record, I retired from the Air Force three years ago.) I have no objection to this story being used in other publications as long as I get written credit wherever it appears. This happened at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts in June of 1953 (maybe ! 54J- Otis Air Force Base is on Cape Cod about 12 miles east of Buzzards Bay at the edge of old Camp Edwards. Just after dark an F-94C with classified electronic gear aboard took off in a westerly direction. The crew consisted of the pilot, Captain Suggs, and the Radar Officer (R/0) Lt. Barkoff. According to the pilot's sworn testimony, shortly after breaking ground - at an altitude of 1500 feet over the Base Rifle Range - the engine quit functioning and the entire electrical systems failed. As the aircraft's nose dropped toward the ground at an ever increasing angle, the pilot stopcocked the throttle and yelled to the R/0 to bail out. The normal bail out sequence in this particular type of aircraft calls for the R/0 to jetison the canopy by pulling a lever which activates ex- plosive bolts, then pulling a second handle which ejects him from the air- craft by means of an explosive device under the seat. The pilot, upon hearing the second explosion which tells him that the R/0 is clear of the aircraft, is then free to eject. In this case, however, the pilot ejected immediately after the R/0 jetisoned the canopy because the aircraft had now descended to about 600 feet at a steep angle and was about 3 seconds from impact. The parachute opened and acted as an airbrake to slow the pilot down and stopped his forward motion just as his feet hit the ground. He landed in the backyard of a house near the base and the first indication that the owner had that there was something amiss is when he heard Captain Suggs calling out to his R/0, \"Bob, where are you?\" The R/0 could not be found and the pilot had a difficult time convinc- ing the owner that his aircraft had crashed because the man had been sitting hear an open, screened window and had heard nothing. The crippled plane should have crashed near where Suggs landed but it wasn't there. This caused one of the most extensive and intensive searches I have ever seen or heard tell of. The Cape was literally combed, both on foot and from the air, for three months without turning up a thing. The aircraft and the R/0 were never found. There are all sorts of points to ponder in this case. For example, if the aircraft did not impact on land, then it must have somehow reached Buzzards Bay some 12 miles away and crashed in the water. If this happened, then someone would most certainly have seen or heard it because the bay is crowded with pleasure and commercial watercraft at this time of year. No"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"one saw or heard it. In addition, the aircraft had a full fuel aboard and if it did not explode in flames on impact, it would have left a large fuel slick on the surface. There was no fuel slick. The Navy dragged the bay from end to end but no wreckage was found* In view of the fact that the pilot stopcocked the throttle and the aircraft was descending at a steep angle only 600 feet from the ground when the pilot ejected, we can discount the possibility that the crash occured in the water. This leaves us with the only other alternative and that is the fact that the aircraft, in all logic, impacted on the ground.This whole event took place in a well populated area at the height of the tourist season. If it did crash in that area, it would have creat- ed a detonation heard for miles; yet, no explosion was heard, no flames were seen and no wreckage was found. What caused the complete and simultaneous failure of all engine and electrical systems? Aircraft systems are designed to combat this very contingency. All the electrical systems have their own separate power sources so if one power source fails, the others are not effected; yet the pilot swears thst, without warning, the cockpit lights, navigation lights, instruments, radio and engine simply went dead. In the final analysis, it would seem that the aircraft and the R/0 literally vanished into some form of oblivion in the 3 seconds between the time that Captain Suggs left the aircraft at 600 feet and the time it whould have crashed to earth. As far as I know, the aircraft and the R/0 were never found. At least, it hadn't been located as of December 1954, when I was re- assigned to an oversees station. Where are they? Perhaps the \"Twightlight Zone\" is not just a figment of Rod Serling's imagination. Some of the circumstances involved in this case were classified and I have had to frame my story around them. Jets of this nature were dispatched to intercept aerial objects that failed to respond to radar identification. It was on just this type of mission that this aircraft vanished.

We suggest you look for a copy on your newsstand as you will, find it an intensely interesting article even though you may not be especially interested in photography. If you ARE, then this article should be a \"must.\" The editor of the magazine introduced the article with a note stating it is \"a photographic exercise pertaining to the use of photography as an analytical tool for the measuring of distance, speed and size. «e are in no way acknowledging or denying the existence of UFO's.\" On Nov. 22, 1966, the story began off Highway 5& at the 5000 foot level near the Williamette Pass in Oregon. A man, described by Mr. Vance as a \"relaxed college professor type\" and \"a careful, thoughtful person\" was making a slow climb up a snowbank at the Diamond Peak over- look in order to take a picture of the mountain. On reaching the top, he took two pictures and waited for perhaps another shot through the churning mists. Suddenly something appeared in front of him and with camera at eye he instinctively mapped the shutter. \"In that moment our man joined the ranks of the five million people in the United States who have seen UFO's, but with one essential difference —he had taken a picture of it and the number of people who have done that is probably less than 200,\" Mr. Vance wrote. The witness first contacted the U. S. Air Force and received a telephone call from an Air Force officer who insisted the witness had seen three \"Frisbees\" tossed in the air. The witness then contacted NICAP and after a six-months wait was in- formed the case would be closed without additional study, Mrs. Idabel Epperson, in charge of a southern California chapter of that organization, wasn't satisfied with the \"analysis\" and Mr. Vance, who has been doing photo analysis for the group for about five years finally got the negative, camera, a couple prints and much of the correspondence regarding the work. We will not go into his further investigation and technical analysis of the photo--the main part of the article—as, frankly, we could not do justice to the report with a shortened version, so suggest you buy a copy of the magazine and read the full report. However, there seems no doubt that the photo is a genuine shot of a UFO and Mr. Vance's careful study has explained some features not under- stood until this time. He offers good advice to anyone getting a picture of a UFO. Get sev- eral copies of \"Form J\" from the Copyright Office, Library of Congress, Washington, D. C. 20540. Filing the form with two copies of the picture and $6 will protect your interest for 28 years. No one can use it with- out your permission for that time. Mr. Vance concludes his article with the following paragraph: \"The UFO mystery appears to be the nearest window to a new era in science, and photography is in a pivotal position because not only is the camera a great tool for investigation, but also for creating interest. The mind of man has always seen to it that the most ambitious fantasies of the previous century have been topped by the events of the next. We've already done more than the most wild 19th Century writers could imagine and soon \"2001\" may seem archaic as we look through that glass.\" Editor's Note: We are happy to report Mr. Vance is now a Consultant in Photography for MUFON, and Mrs. Epperson is one of our State-Section Directors."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Rand Cocument Proposes New UFO Unit and Further Investigation Writers Hobert B. Klinn and David Branch continue their research into matters ufological, new and old, and their findings on the Rand Document has appeared in issues of \"The Register 9 n Santa Ana, California. Again we thank Professor Charle* Kahlert for sending us these fine articles. The Rand Document, \"UFOs: What to Do?* 1 appeared in November, 1963, and is unavailable to the public. It is filed in the library of this country 1 s top military, ultra-high security, think-tank facility, the Rand Corpora- tion. Rand is a sprawling \"little Pentagon\" situated opposite the Los Angeles County Court House in Santa Monica, California. This document, objective and far-reaching in its evaluation and rec- ommendations concerning the status and future of the UFO profelem in this country, has so infuriated Major Hector Quintanilla, notoriously anti- UFO ex-chief of the U.S. Air Force's defunct Project Blue Book, that he has written a highly critical letter to the Rand Corporation, boss of the author of the report. Klinn and Branch read the letter which is \"nasty in tone and crudely worded\" and all but orders the author, astronomer George Kocher / now a member of MUFON. See January \"Message\"/ to be fired for having written it. In contrast to Quintanilla's reaction, the writers learned the report was very favorably received by officials at the U. S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Operations (SAMSO) office in Los Angeles. When the report was first circulated among Rand Corp. scientists, many were eager to initiate the recommendations. Unfortunately, the report came out at about the time Blue Book was about to close down and get the Air Force out of the UFO business—and, since the U.S. Air Force is the prime employer of the Rand Corp, it wouldn't do to have the prestigious Rand Corp. contradict it by proposing an \"expanded data collection and analysis effort.\" The writers don't say how they obtained a copy of the document, but they give a detailed report of its contents in their article. It has five parts: One - UFOs; Historical Aspects; Two - UFOs: Astrono- mical Aspects; Three - UFOs: The Character of Reports; Four - UFOs: Phe- nomenological Aspects; and Five - UFOs: How to Proceed and Why. The report states that it was apparently the CIA's recommendation to follow a policy of debunking UFOs and discouraging public interest in them --with the result thafauthorities tended to make witnesses look ridicu- lous.\" Klinn and Branch say the document includes several UFO reports never before published, showing in-depth investigations, data, diagrams, and drawings of variously shaped UFOs . To quote: In one Newton, Illinois sighting of a \"prolate spheroidal shape\" seen 35 feet off the ground, \"the design at the lower rear looked like a pattern of crosses and dots.* The report states, \"As far as Mrs. A's sighting is concerned, we have obtained enough data from follow-up inquiry and onsight investigation to rule out known airborne craft, meteorological and astronomical phenomena. Yet the observations are sufficiently detailed to give us adequate confi- dence that some sort of machine was present, behaving in a very extra- ordinary way.\" (End, quote) The report mentions that UFOs seem to have been with us from the earliest times, but with a drastic increase in the number of sightings in the past twenty-five years."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The report then proposes the \"organization of a central report-receiv- ing agency, staffed by a permanent group of experienced UFO investigators and havine on call specialists in astronomy, physics, optics, atmospheric physics, psychology. . tt It goes on to suggest report forms to be made available in post offices, toll-free telephone lines and a link of the agency with a network of radio amateurs! local police and scientists* And there is much more. What a pity the Rand Document was filed away instead of being adopted by our government. But it is still good to know the document was written and accepted by the corporation, and perhaps it will be given the con- sideration it deserves when government \"policy\" changes to facing facts instead of denying them. They Were Around in 19021 Ted Phillips' wife, Ginger, gets the credit for this one. She gave a copy of Dr. Hynek's book as a Christmas gift to the department head where she is employed in Sedalia, Mo., and the interest aroused by the book resulted in this report coming to her: Mrs. R., now 35 years of age, and a friend were on their way to visit friends across the Osage River near Ivy Bend. While they were waiting for the ferry boat, they heard a sound coming down the river. At first they thought it was the ferry boat and were watching to see it come into view. What they did see was a silvery gray object shaped like a top, and spinning, coming down the driver at about tree-top level and much faster than a boat could travel. It passed in front of them and went on up the river and out of sight. <r hey estimated it to be about 300 feet from them at the closest point. It was observed less than two minutes. This happened in 1902,and Mrs. R never forgot it—and we can all understand why. Word From Canada Vie were pleased to hear from John Brent Musgrave, who is conducting a UFO course at the Grant MacEwan College in Edmonton, 1 Alberta, Canada (see Short Notes in January issue of SKYLOOK) and he has just become Investigations Chairman for the Edmonton UFO Society, and promises to send us any interesting reports that comes his way.

The collie was found lying on its back and all hairs on the dog's body had been removed except for a a few. There was no evidence of any sort of \"attack 1 * and the body was found about 40 feet from a circular area where the grass was whipped in counterclockwise direction, altho some grass lay in a clockwise direction. This circular area was 6 feet in diameter. Power lines are in the area, the nearest being about 400 feet from where the dog was found. The dog had been seen alive on July 13* At about the same time a neighbor reported their two cats had disappeared. It was noted that no scavengers had touched the dog's body which had been in the area five days. It is assumed the dog had been dead that long, as it had a friendly nature and the \"Smiths\" do not feel it would have stayed away from home, if alive. There had been rain during this period, and the investigators could find no tracks near the body. Mystery Light Seen in Oklahoma A brilliant blue-white light of undetermined origin was sighted over the Devil's Promenade area early Sept. 19, 1972 by Mr, and Mrs. George McWatters, who live on a farm near Quapaw, Oklahoma* McWatters told a reporter from the Miami, Okla., \"News-Record\" that he awoke about 5:30 or 6 a.m. and was in the kitchen when he first saw the light. \"It seemed to be coming over the river and it was a bright blue- white. At first I thought it might be just some sort of reflection off the river and I went to another room to drink a cup of coffee. When I came back to the kitchen though, I saw it had moved to the east and was getting brighter.\" He watched the light for several minutes as it seemed to move slowly to the east, getting brighter all the time. He then woke up his wife to come look at the light. \"It moved out just so far, and then seemed to be hanging there not too far above tree top level,\" he said. \"Itwas the oddest color, sort of a bluish green and white, and too bright to look directly at it for very long.\" Both McWatters and his wife stated that they saw the light clearly, even though the sun was coming up and there were no stars visible in the sky. It was bigger and brighter than any star, Mrs. McWatters said. They watched the light until it vanished about 7 a.m.. Just before it did vaniah, two more lights, not as bright, but of the same odd blue- white color, appeared to the south of the original light. \"We could see all three together, then the two smaller ones vanished.\" McWatters stated that the bright light seemed to get brighter as it moved away. \"It seemed to be hanging there about six to ten miles away and it got very bright before it disappeared.\" A check with the flight services office at the Joplin airport this morning showed that no weather balloons were launched from there today and there were no reports from the Joplin or Miami airports of aircraft.

McDonald Cites Startling UFO Reports Buried in Maxwell AFB Files— Tape Made June 1970 Robert B. Klinn and Devid Branch, whose fine articles on UFOs appear in the Santa Ana \"Register\" (California), stated in the Dec. 6, 1972 issue they had recently heard a two-hour recording of an unpublicized UFO briefing by internationally famous physicist, the late Dr. James E. McDonald, before a small group of Institute of Elec- trical and Electronics Engineers gathered at Santa Monica's Miramar Hotel, June 9, 1970. The talk was taped a few months before his un- timely death and two days after he had returned from two weeksof digging into the UFO files at Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama. McDonald was the senior physicist at the Institute for Atmospheric Physics at the University of Arizona at Tucson. In 1970, after the Science Foundation had okayed the Condon Report, the Air Force decided they wanted to destroy all their UFO records. Dr. McDonald wa s con- cerned and had hopes of preserving the records and getting them into the National Archives. He told the Engineers the records \"are still alive and well and nestled deep in the archives at the Historical Division at Maxwell Air Force Base.\" He had Just returned from the Base and said he ex- amined about 400 cases and the number of really significant cases which, to hjs knowledge had never received publicity—above all the radar cases, \"are very, very impressive. n \"The total population of hidden UFO reports is a pool of informa- tion completely untapped,\" he said. Dr. McDonald obviously believed it was Air Force policy to sweep UFO reports under the rug. The strongest argument to support a cover- up hypothesis, he said is:\" They can't be that stupid. It is almost impossible to believe all those errors—the ineptness of the expla- nations.\" He was referring to the flimsy explanations offered for the UFO reports the public heard about and asked about—as well as th e many reports received by the Air Force and simply buried in the files with little or no investigation. In his lecture he cited a number of cases from the files which had never been publicized—or satisfactorily explained. Professor Chas. Kahlert, who sends us the articles from \"The Register\" writes he talked to Stanton Friedman about the files at Maxwell AFB, and Mr. Friedman who has lectures scheduled in that area, is going to make an attempt to receive permission to see the files* Vie hope to hear more about this. Again, we suggest that our readers write to the \"Register\" to see if complete copies of the McDonald report are available.

It was based on writer Erich von Daniken's thesis that ancient astro- nauts influenced the creation of such things as the huge Easter Island stone heads, Stonehenge, the Egyptian pyramids and the Mayan calendar. Among the evidence offered in the TV showing was ancient drawings and sculptures depicting strange beings wearing what appear to be space suits; a 2,000-year-old clay vase, in a Bagdad museum, which is also an electric bettery; and maps made by Turkish Adm. Piri Reis in the 1st century A. D. which Von Daniken says show the earth as it would have appeared to astronauts high above Cairo.

He immediately called to his wife to i come out and look at the object which was about 30 degrees above the western horizon* It was shaped like a quarter-moon with the rounded part heading west and appeared to be \"self-luminous.\" It was bright orange in color and remained in sight approximately 30 seconds. The sky was overcast with thick clouds, and it was calm* There was no smoke or vapor trail from the object which did not change in size or color as it was observed* Mrs. Hudson called the local radio station to report what she had seen and to ask if anyone else had called in. There were no other reports* On reading one of the press articles about Mr. DeGraw, Mrs. \"Brown\" - a retired school teecher - wrote to him to report a sighting on Oct. 22, 1972* Mr. and Mrs. \"Brown\", who live in rural Fredericksburg, Chicka- sflw County, were on their way home from Fredericksburg on Highway No. Id, about ij miles west of town, when Mr. Brown noticed a bright red light to their right and about 30 degrees above the northern horizon. It was about £ p.m. with the wind out of the north and a light, freezing rain falling. Mrs. Brown described the light as very large and bright, and \"of the peculiar shade of red of a neon sign and of great intensity at the center.\" She said the color was so intense, there seemed to be rays shooting out in all direction fromthe center. The light \"as large as a bushel basket* was moving southward, toward the observers, and they expected it to pass overhead. However, it stopped when apparently an eighth of a mile distant and then just suddenly disappeared \"like turning off a light.\" When asked about the altitude, Mrs. Brown said it seemed to be about to make a landing in the field and the altitude was much less than a plane could maintain. Mr. and Mrs. \"I\", who live a few miles southeast of St. Lucas in Fayette County, reported that at six p.m. on January 5, 1973, they saw a bright light in a stationary position in the eastern sky about 15 degrees above the horizon, •'•hey watched it for a minute and a half and then it \"went off like switching off an electric light.\" It was a bright white in color, Mr. X said, and seemed to pulsate. The night wes clear, with no clouds to become between the observers and object and it is noted that Venus and Mars were not visible in the eastern sky at the time the object was noted* Other sightings are being investigated and reports will be made later.

Subject \"Other Letters** 1 \"I am sending you two sketches and the necessary explanations on what my colleague Vityi Ingeborg and I have seen. As my colleague from the Semenic Mountain station has informed you, the flying object was observed by him on March 29th at k p.m. and again on March 30th at 6* a.m. He called us and then we also observed this object. Also those from the Caransebea and the Cuntu stations observed it. \"At first glatce the object looked like a meterological balloon. The shape of it was that of a cone with the sides very much rounded, like the sides of an egg reversed. The color was a dull white with the side facing the sun extremely bright. It caught our attention because of its strong reflection, sudden movements with a slight variations on the vertical and almost directly against the direction of the wind (which is impossible for any type of a research balloon). \"We watched it for two and a half hours until it disappeared from view. Its movements were slow and alternating with rapid spurts and sudden stops. \"After thirty minutes our colleague from Berzeasca saw it. (This was about 1 p.m.) Between 1 and 3 p.m. it was not seen in our area, but at k p.m. it appeared again, this time much larger and closer with its shape much more clearly visible. The shape was that of an isosceles triangle with the small side facing the direction in which it was moving. \"Even though at first glance it did not appear to be higher than 7000 meters and its speed seemed to be much faster now. The speed was const- ant now and the object was estimated to be about thirty kilometers high. This estimated altitude was arrived at by the comparison to the altitude of two airplanes seen between k and 6 p.m. \"At 6:10 p.m. the flying object had passed the horizon. This time the movement was almost linear with large curves and keeping the same direction of flight. The dimensions were very large. It must have been a very huge object, since although it was at a much greater altitude than the airplanes we saw, its dimensions were about the same as that of these aircraft. \"At sunset the object began to lose its brightness, becoming a dull white, which gave us reason to think it did not have its own light source. Later, after the appearance of the first stars, the object became red in color and the edges or sides were barely visible. When it got dark, the object took on the shape of a disc or dot of light whith was emitting a very strong light. (It resembled Jupiter or Venus, but much larger and a bit more brilliant.) This was very puzzling to us. \"The next morning it followed the same steps in changing its lurainous- ity and movement of it was parallel with the previous movement it made, only this time it was in the opposite direction. \" Signed: Vasile Cotoi Many readers will observe that the towns and the meteorological stations, from these letters are all in about the same geographic area. There are Semenic, Caransebes, Tarcu Peak, Cuntu Mountain, Berzeasca, Resita and Oravita. In these three reports are some common elements, which force us to believe that it was one and the same object: the high altitude, the re- duced speed, the manner in which it moved through the sky, the luminous- ity, the shape and as for the last element, the shape, we have to say that the form of a cone is not new to the UFO phenomena. 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"As for the comparison with a parachute, it was also mentioned of the object seen over Sofia, Bulgaria on November 21st of last year.

But, 4# hours is less than 62 hours (and some of the citizens from Caransebes claimed it stayed over their town or was visible from their location for four days). It is much like a world's record, taking into view the vast number of witnesses to this appearance, the classification of those witnesses (met- eorologists, topographers and a few engineers) and the use of the optical instruments available to these observers (theodolite and binoculars). So, this file remains open, waiting for new witnesses, who have seen this phenomena in the skies over Romania. * Michel writes of a desert mystery. In 1942 ten camel-riders, two radio operators and a meteorologist comprised the garrison at the isolated fort Ouallen in the heart of the desert, 170 miles south of Aoulef. On April 4 a group commanded by Captain Louis LePrieur arrived for a three weeks stay. \"We had been there a few days,\" says Captain LePrieur,\" when one morning the meteorologist N.C.O. came in and drew my attention to a kind of T planet f which had appeared in the cloudless sky immediately above the fort. The object was visible to the naked eye and looked like a small aluminum speck. There were about forty of us and we saw it quite plainly, as the atmosphere was perfectly clear.\" He went on to say the object viewed through field glasses and the telescope of a theodolite looked like a small moon with a pale metallic glint and seemed to be suspended at an altitude of 15,000 to 18,000 feet. It appeared to be motionless, but prolonged examination revealed that it was slowly rotating—three complete revolutions in an S-hour period. The next morning the object was immediately overhead, and the group began to take it for granted, assuming it must be a stray star or a new satellite, for at that time no one had heard of flying saucers, the Captain said. At dawn on the third day there was no sign of the object. Captain LePrieur sent a telegram to the national meteorological authorities at Algiers, reporting what had been seen and asking for an explanation. Sometime later he was informed the object was the star Vega. \"This explanation struck us as unexpected and improbable, as a star does not remain for two whole days in the same spot, immediately overhead and so close as to be examined at leisure with an ordinary telescope,\" the Captain said. \"1 have often wondered what could have been the nature and origin of the strange disc with its metallic gleam, and what could have caused it to remain in the sky above that serai-lunar Sahara land- scape where nothing of interest is to be seen apart from the small fort.\" WILHELM REICH, M.

Flashes of Light on Moon Still a Scientific Puzzle ~~ Scientists are divided over the meaning or mysterious light flashes sighted on the moon ! s surface by the Apollo astronauts. Harrison (Jack) Schmitt spotted the first near the crater Grimaldi, toward the western edge of the moon T s face and just south of the equater* On Monday after Schmitt and Eugene Cernan landed on the moon, Ronald Evans in the orbiting command ship reported seeing two more flashes of light. One was near the Crater Copernicus, just northwest of the moon ! s center point as seen from i-arth, and the other near Mare Orientale, on the western edge of the moon's face. Seismometers have not recorded anything unusual in these areas, which seems to argue against the hypothesis that the flashes could be caused by small meteorite impacts. But scientists were not ruling this out completely* Another theory was that the flashes were gases being vented from the moon's interior.

This one is FLUNG SAUCER MESSAGE, something of a companion volume to his first book, FLYING SAUCER VIEWPOINT. As in the first book, Dutta ' again delves into Theosophy and other occult philosophies, emerging with a complex and highly debatable theory to account for UFOs. Act- ually, theories such as Dutta's have little to do with the actual facts of the UFO subject. Perhaps the most interesting section of the book is the author's account of an \"outer space\" telephone call received by a radio station following that station's discussion of UFOs.

In ten chapters, he discusses such things as novel re- action systems, force-field propulsion, electro-gravitic systems, in- ertia neutralizers, space warps and teleportation. And, of course, a chapter is devoted to speculations on UFO propulsion methods. Illus- trations and an extensive bibliography will also be found in the book.

By George D. Fawcett, 607 N. Main, Mt. Airy, N.C. Whatever the truth is, it appears that UFOs created a massive wave of global reports throughout 1972, as thousands of unknown flying objects (the newest name given them this year by the U.S. Air Force after 25 years of investigations) were reported in the skies and on the ground from over 40 countries and all fifty states in the U.S.A. The influx of new UFO reports included landings, radar trackings, photographs and movie films, occupant reports, pilot reports, auto chases, shooting incidents, electro-magnetic interferences and dramatic secon- dary effects on soil samples, animals, machines and humans. The seriousness of the UFO situation was underscored when a spheri- cal luminous orange UFO triggered an air raid alarm and attracted three surface-to-air missiles (which were unable to reach the UFO) above Hanoi, the North Vietnamese capital in broad daylight on September 29. Two weeks before on September 14 two Air Defense Command F106 fighter jets (each armed with four air-to-air missiles) were dispatched from the Homestead Air Force Base near Miami, Florida to chase a UFO reported from widely separated areas by pilots, ground observers, FAA officials and flight controllers. On radar the UFO appeared to be six to eight times larger than normal aircraft. The UFO evaded the jets at a 15,000 foot alti- tude. On June 26 at Ft. Beaufort, South Africa, frightened farmers and police \"shot at and hit\" a terrifying UFO at a distance of less than 45 feet. The bullets bounced off the edge of the UFO with a ! metallic thud' and then it left the area at rapid speed. Air Force, Navy and civilian \"radar trackers\" at the Patuxent Naval St£tion(Md.), Dover Air Force Base (Delaware), Dsvis-Monthan Air *orce Base (Tucson, Arizona), Naval Air Station (South Weymouth, Mass.), Hans- corn Field (Bedford, Mass.), Fairchild Air Force Base (Spokane, imash.), Palm Beach and Miami International Airports (Florida) were plagued with good \"hard returns\" on their radar screens that remained unexplained. Radarmen in England, Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, Japan and Finland and elsewhere were having the same problems with the mysterious UFOs. In- ternational boundaries were being violated quite often and little could be done about it, except to try to continue to classify the information surrounding UFOs detected on scientific instrumentation under security regulations. The most fascinating of all UFO reports involved such objects seen not in the air but on the ground. And such reports can.e from a variety of witnesses at 20 locations in eignt states and seven foreign countries. Stsrtled observers reported landed UFOs from Tokoroa, Mew Zealand; from Georges AFB, Ca.; from Laurens, Boone and New Sharon, Iowa; i'rom Amy, Kit Carson County and Wyandotte County, Kansas; from Novi, Michigan; from Norton Sound, Alaska; from Burlington, Colo.; from Tucuman, Argen- tina; from foiltsdown, N. Z.; from Pscy-sur-Eure, France; from Acuesoma, Mexico; from Andover Township. N. J.; from Pleasant View, Ark.; and from Port Lincoln end Queensland, Australia. Such landings left frightened witnesses, panic-strickened animels, background radiation increases, burned circles (most 25 to 30 feet in diameter), tripod landing gear marks, depressions end markings on the ground, soil changes, denuded veg- etation etc. In these UFO landings both metallic and non-metal]ic residues were found at such sites such as aluminum, calcium, iron, boron, magnesium, potash, copper, silicon, zinc and titanium. Most often detected scents at such areas include sulfuric and ammonia-like odors.
