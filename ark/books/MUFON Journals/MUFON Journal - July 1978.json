FROM THE EDITOR This is a \"sensational\" issue of the journal; however, \"sensationalism\" is not its purpose. For 30 years we have heard tales of crashed \"saucers\" and bodies of small spacemen, and most of us have been totally skeptical. Now Len Stringfield has compiled the most convincing case to date that we may have been wrong and the U.S. Government (possibly others too) may actually have the ultimate proof—hardware and alien specimens. The case is circumstantial and cannot be adequately documented at this time, but it is now bolstered by a multiplicity of new sources who may, in time, talk more openly so that the entire complex of stories can be properly evaluated. The implications of their collective story are profound, if true. Len has purposely made public the main features of this testimony, knowing full well that it will not stand up as objective proof in its present form, in order to encourage UFO researchers to aid in confirming or disproving \"crashed saucers and little men\" for once and for all. He wants and expects penetrating critiques, and he hopes that more evidence can be uncovered by a cooperative effort. Similarly, the previously unpublished Russian document reported in this issue speaks of sensational events and high-level government knowledge that have been withheld from the public. The alleged events need to be authenticated, for, if true, they are of profound importance. Astronaut movie films of UFOs on the Moon? NATO missiles \"zapped\" by UFOs? Detailed documents on UFOs in Russia? There is a clear need to learn how much of all this \"sensationalism\" is actually true, and to expose as false all that is false.

Uniquely, the locale was the former headquarters of Project Blue Book at Wright-Patterson AFB. Even though it was billed as a National UFO Symposium, the international influence was in evidence by the presence of one of the workshop speakers, Mrs. Cynthia Hind, MUFON Representative from Salisbury, Rhodesia, and a large contingent of members from Canada headed by Henry H. McKay, MUFON Canadian Regional Director. Hosted by The Ohio UFO Investigators League (OUFOIL) and sponsored by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON), this was undoubtedly our finest symposium in three distinct categories: the most outstanding group of pioneer UFOlogists as speakers, the largest facility, and a record-breaking attendance. Every person responsible for making this symposium such a success is to be commended for their superb work. The Dayton Convention Center, as pictured on the front cover of the April 1978 issue of The MUFON UFO Journal, was a most prestigious setting for this international conclave of UFOlogists. This article is written for the people who would have liked to have attended the symposium, but were unable to do v so, due to transportation costs from the far comers of the world. The major speeches are contained in the copyrighted published copies of the 1978 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings, that are available from MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, Texas 78155, U.S.A. for $6.00 in the U.S.A. and $7.00 in all other countries postpaid. The 1978 Symposium Proceedings were dedicated to Mrs. Rosetta Holmes, with special acknowledgement to our Staff Artist Donald R. Tucker for the cover, depicting close encounters of the first, second, third, and fourth kinds, symbolic of the symposium theme. We are indebted to our office secretary, Mrs. Virginia Castner, for the original typing. I will not attempt to review all of the papers presented, but simply provide an insight into their contents by quoting from the speakers abstract or introduction. Ted Bloecher, Co- Chairman of* MUFON's Humanoid Study Group and State Section Director for the New Vork City area, titled his paper appropriately \"A Survey of CE3K Reports for 1977.\" He has outlined the material covered in his paper with his abstract from which he is quoted. \"Close encounters, Type III, reports (CEHI's) for 1977 are reviewed and listed systematically. A brief background on the historical precedents for CEIH reports is given, and cases are reviewed statistically by month, by time of day, geographically, and by the types of association between entities and objects. Examples from the case material illustrate special features, such as ground traces, animal reactions, physical effects, communication, and other particular features. A table listing all of the CEffl reports known for 1977 is included, which provides a number of specific .pieces of information, including date, time, locale, witness names, number and height of entities, and other special features. Case references are provided for each case.\" Richard H. Hall, Editor of The MUFON UFO Journal, formerly MUFON International Coordinator, and past Assistant Director of NICAP, selected as his topic \"1967: The Overlooked UFO Wave and the Colorado Project.\" Quoting from his abstract, we learn the following: \"A major wave of UFO sightings occurred in 1967; even by official Air Force figures it was the 4th largest in terms of sightings reported,. yet no one talks about it. The special significance of the 1967 wave is that it occurred during the one full year of investigations by the University of Colorado UFO Project, and everyone deferred to the project in looking for 'answers'. The only answer was the Condon Report. This study analyzes the wave and demonstrates that the Colorado Project had ample case material to investigate during its lifetime, yet failed miserably to accomplish 'scientific investigation.' At the same time, publicity about the project obscured the sighting wave.\" \"Retrievals of the Third Kind — A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody\" by Leonard H. Stringfield, MUFON Director of Public Relations and a State Section Director, held the key to the publicity surrounding this year's symposium. U.S. Air Force personnel at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, were quick to deny any knowledge of Mr. Stringfield's allegations of witness statements to having observed both crashed craft and small beings delivered to the. base during the regime of Project Blue Book and later, when queried by the press. Quoting from a few pertinent paragraphs from Leonard's 2-hour presentation may set the stage for his challenge. \"Retrievals of the Third Kind relate primarily to the alien being. To be more precise, I refer to incidents where a UFO has allegedly crashed and both it and the occupants were retrieved by military personnel who were (continued on next page) _"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Symposium, continued) dispatched to the scene. According to my sources, these immobilized craft and deceased occupants, described as humanoid, have been placed in custody at certain military installations where they were studied under the highest security measures.\" Leonard prefaces his accounts with this statement. \"I am not in a Providential position to pass a positive or final judgment on the retrieval stories or on my informants. On this tenous ground I must allow for some marginal error in observation or , tiny flaw in human judgment for each reported account. However, let me quote an old adage. \"Wherever there is smoke there is fire,\" and from my position I certainly can see a helluva lot of smoke!\" He continues — \"Also, for the record, I do not possess a single affidavit to prove that any one of my informants has seen a retrieved craft or its occupants. I have only their names and their testimony. Unfortunately, I cannot use these names. (Editors note: some names were released in his talk and a tape recording of another witness was played on the P.A. system.) Anonymity has been requested and will be respected. The reasons should be obvious to all. (Editors note: obvious to all except the press.) In essence, therefore, the cases I present in this paper without names to back up the informant's testimony can be construed as hearsay. If perchance, hearsay is to be my undoing then I must make my stand on the merits of my own credibility which I trust has already been established in my 29 years of UFO research. You are the judge and jury.\" Leonard then presented 17 cases or abstracts of exciting testimonials to substantiate his study of this controversial area that many had considered nothing but rumors prior to this time. These cases are very revealing, and when placed back-to- back give a high degree of credibility that a grand official cover-up does exist. We recommend that you purchase a ' copy of the 1978 Proceedings for the details on each case, supplemented by some added information in this issue. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the Center for UFO Studies, Evanston, Illinois, was the featured speaker Saturday evening. His speech, titled \"UFOs As a Space-Time Singularity,\" injected additional theories and hypotheses into the explanation for UFOs after reviewing some of the predominant ideas as to their origin and the questions still unanswered. He leans away from the conventional \"nuts and bolts\" explanation of physical craft and beings conducting a surveillance of the planet Earth. He is searching for an explanation that not only can explain the. appearance of craft, humanoids, and their landing traces but the medium by which vast distances in space may be bridged. This is the fourth time that Dr. Hynek has been the featured speaker at a MUFON Symposium, having previously shared his research efforts in 1970 at Peoria, 111., 1973 in Kansas City, Mo., 1976 in Ann Arbor, Mich., and 1978 in Dayton, Ohio. It was a pleasure to have the Center for UFO Studies so strongly represented by Dr. and Mrs. Hynek, along with Allan and Elaine Hendry at our symposium. In his introductory remarks, Dr. Hynek had this to say — \"As most of you know, MUFON and the Center for UFO Studies have a pleasant cooperative arrangement and effect a considerable exchange of information. Indeed, when the Center was first organized, MUFON was the only major UFO Investigative Organization that expressed a willingness to entertain such a cooperative plan proposed by the Center. We hope it will continue and prosper.\" In addition to the first appearance of Richard H. Hall and Leonard H. Stringfield on a MUFON Symposium platform, our vast audience had the distinct opportunity to hear and meet Major Donald E. Keyhoe as the featured speaker on Saturday afternoon. Major Keyhoe selected a subject that was a follow-up to several books that he has written during the past 25 years. Titled, \"Behind the UFO Secrecy,\" a sub-title could have been \"The UFO Cover-up — the greatest deception in the history of the United States.\" The Major then proceeded to relate a series of actual cases to stubstantiate his statement, starting from his early involvement in the study of current events. As most of our Journal readers know, Major Keyhoe was the Director of NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) during the period when it was the largest such organization in the world and now serves on its Board of Governors. His Assistant Director at that time was Richard H. Hall. In his concluding remarks, Don Keyhoe brought us up to date with the current status of UFO research and made some pertinent recommend- ations for the near future. He said — \"The pressure to end censorship is rapidly increasing. In October of 1978, the United Nations representatives will vote on the suggestion of international UFO investigations. Also in October, Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists and engineers will begin an impressive program to detect radio signals from intelligent beings in space. A lawsuit has been filed against the CIA, under the Freedom of Information Act, to force the complete release of all UFO information in the CIA's possession. Behind the scenes, there are strong efforts to create an official program to attempt communication with UFO aliens and learn the purposes of the long surveillance and to take steps toward peaceful contacts if there is no serious physical bar.\" The Specialization Workshops and Moderators for the Saturday afternoon session were: (1) \"Field Investigative Techniques\" by Joe Santangelo, Waltham, Mass., MUFON State Director; (2) \"The Humanoid Catalog\" by Ted Bloecher, New York, N.Y.; (3) \"UFO Reports from Africa\" by Mrs. Cynthia Hind, Salisbury, Rhodesia, MUFON Representative for Rhodesia; (4) \"UFO .Photographic Analysis\" by Bruce Maccabee, Ph. D., Silver Springs, Md., Consultant and State Director, and (5) Consultants Conference by Williard P. Armstrong, Ph.D., Consultant and State Director for Missouri. On Sunday morning the Annual MUFON Corporate Meeting was held. This was reviewed briefly in the Director's Message in the June issue of the Journal. A double feature marked the Sunday afternoon session, when Mrs. Jennie Zeldman of Columbus, Ohio, and Walt Andrus, International Director presented a combination slide/lecture titled \"Revisiting the Major (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Special From Russia ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE? By Vladimir G. Azhazha (Note: This synopsis of a press conference held at the USSR Academy of Sciences on November 24, 1977, was submitted to James M. McCampbell, MUFON Director of Research, by Valerii I. Sanarov. Mr. Campbell arranged for its translation. Sanarov, who lives in the Siberian science city of Novosibirsk, has recently joined MUFON as a Consultant in Cultural Exchanges. The speaker, Azhazha, is identified as a researcher at the USSR Academy of Sciences Submarine Research Center. His audience consisted of employees of the NOVOSTI Press Agency. McCampbell points out that although some distortions or errors may be seen^in accounts of American sightings, this is less likely for the Russian reports made in the native languages. He notes that the article provides \"new perspectives and details regarding the UFO problem in Russia.. .(and contains) several points of special significance.\" Some of the statements made are highly important, if authentic, in relation to high-level knowledge of UFOs by Russia and the United States.-Editor) I am a representative of the unofficial point of view. Over the years, I have directed the subject area of \"UFO Phenomena in the Hydro- sphere\" at the USSR Academy of Sciences. Therefore, I had to become acquainted with the entire problem as a whole at the same time. Today I will talk about the facts and their distortions, the hypotheses, explanations for the phenomena, the . philosophical problems which have arisen due to these explanations and different evidence, specifically the testimony of the American astronauts who were on the Moon. I will begin with the fact that UFOs are an objective reality which is present in our feelings and sensations. There are millions of people who have seen UFOs; there are photographs and filmstrips of unidentified flying objects. Through physical fields, UFOs have a direct effect on terrestrial equipment and living things. Short, accidental contacts have already taken place between UFO pilots and people on earth.

Mrs. Zeidman related the detailed work that she has done in the Lawrence Coyne helicopter case and the testimony of ground witnesses to the event. Accolades must be given to all of the members of the host organization, The Ohio UFO Investigators League, who did a fantastic job with the facilities, ticket sales, publicity, hotel accomodations, displays, and visual aids. Key personnel from the Dayton, Springfield, Fairfield, Cincinnati, and Cleveland areas were all involved. The leadership was spearhaded by Charles and Geri Wilhelm, Richard Hoffman, George Pelizzari, Leonard Stringfield, Jack Rockel, and Earl Neff, just to mention a few. Richard Hoffman was the master of ceremonies, Geri Wilhelm handled public relations, George Pelizzari was the treasurer, with Charles J. Wilhelm, Executive Director of OUFOIL, coordinating the planning and execution behind the scenes. Earl Neff and Leonard Stringfield did a tremendous job on radio and TV in publicizing the symposium. Larry Moyers, State Director for Ohio, moderated the question and answer period following Dr. Hynek's speech Saturday night when all of the speakers made up the panel. Larry should be very proud of the second MUFON Symposium to be held in his state. Only Illinois and Missouri can make that claim to date, however, California is scheduled for 1979 and 1981. On 21 September 1976, TASS broadcast from Iran that, on 18 September, two aircraft of the Iranian Air Force detected a \"flying saucer\" not far from Tehran, and taking it for a new aircraft design belonging to a foreign power, they gave chase. The \"saucer\" left them but returned later; to the south of Tehran, near the outskirts of the city, an object about 4^ meters in diameter separated from it. and landed on the ground. Two pilots, in tight- fitting, aluminum-colored spacesuits came out of it. They were 2.5 meters tall. After looking the area over, they entered the small \"saucer\" (its weight was subsequently determined to be 5 tons based on the landing gear imprints) and flew off. The Iranian government addressed an inquiry to the governments of the U.S.S.R. and U.S.: Is this incident a test of military equipment by one of the powers (continued on page 12) Illobrand von Ludwiger"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE DAYTON SYMPOSIUM: SOME IMPRESSIONS (By Richard Hall) For me it was an opportunity to see and talk with old friends and colleagues from all parts of the country, some not seen for 10 years or more. The distance factor had prevented more frequent get togethers. The formal talks and workshops, interesting as they were, were not the whole story. As in most conventions, a .lot of valuable information exchange took place in private, informal, smaller.gatherings. Particularly impressive was the closed MUFON corporate meeting on Sunday, during which State Directors, State Section Directors, and others gave brief reports, asked questions, aired grievances, and offered suggestions. The journal was one of numerous topics discussed. I received several very helpful suggestions and also practical offers of help, which will be reflected in upcoming issues. It was delightful to see Idabel and Marilyn Epperson again, from Los Angeles, and to confer for hours with them — covering UFO investigation from A to Z. Isabel Davis, from Washington, D.C., had been in touch with the Epperson's for 22 years and had never met them face-to-face until Dayton. Similarly, through my years of association with MUFON I had not met Walt Andrus face-to-face until this conference. Other confabs were held with Paul Cerny, from the San Francisco Bay area (not seen for about 10 years); Ted Bloecher and a large delegation from New York State; Rich Heiden from Wisconsin; and numerous others from the Midwest and South. Out of these conversations came a number of cooperative projects on important matters affecting all of UFO research. The following items also stand out in my memory: *The fine job done by the host group, OUFOIL, turning out 700-800 people per session; Rich Huffman's expert work as MC; the exhibits, displays, arid general public relations work accomplished by dedicated OUFOIL members in cooperation with other area groups *Len Stringfield fending off hostile questions at a press conference centered around the question of \"humanoid retrievals,\" and maintaining his composure in an atmosphere sometimes bordering on the threatening, laying out the evidence about \"crashed saucers\" and humanoid bodies for UFO researchers to try to verify or refute for once and for all *Jenny Zeidman's excellent verbal report on the 1973 Ohio, helicopter case, based on a report soon to be published by the Center for UFO Studies, establishing the case as a strong one *The flight from Washington to Dayton with Major Donald Keyhoe, talking over old times and future plans with him, joining with him in the Epperson's room to celebrate Isabel Davis' birthday with champagne, seeing him shake hands with Dr. J. Allen Hynek and share the platform on the same side of the UFO subject, hearing the well-deserved ovation he received when introduced to the audience *The calm efficient, patient efforts of Walt Andrus to keep things on the track, threading his way through the inevitable minefield of personalities — individualists with sometimes conflicting outlooks, supplying the all- important organizational and business sense necessary for any cooperative enterprise. *The presence and participation of Dr. Hynek, Mimi Hynek, .and Allen Hendry — all of the Center for UFO Studies — sharing ideas and plans for future publications and for a continued close working relationship with MUFON Despite many obstacles, the 1978 symposium proceedings were published in time to be available at Dayton; an attractive, handsomely printed volume for a memorable occasion. These are but a few of the highlights for me of a busy weekend when I sometimes wished that I could be in three places at once, and had more time to talk at greater length with the many other active MUFON people whom I met. As journal editor, I profited greatly by attending the symposium and I look forward to receiving the information, articles, and ideas so generously offered by so many. All this should help to make the journal even more complete and informative.

Leonard H. Stringfield) Len Stringfield, author of Situation Red. The UFO Siege, is a Board Member of MUFON and also associated with the Center for UFO Studies.

He is Director of Public Relations and Marketing Services of DuBois Chemicals, Cincinnati, Ohio. A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody. 1 Since the advent of the UFO, dating back to World War II when there was official recognition of the \"foo fighter,\" one hard fact stands out: the world public at large still disbelieves in its existence. Another fact: most of our world's scientific community does not believe in UFOs either, although a small number of its Fellowship toduy will admit their puzzlement and sometimes curiosity over the persistence of UFO reports. For those of us dedicated to serious UFO research, working in all professional levels, there is no doubt that a real interloper from somewhere exists! Knowing this is frustrating. Today, after 3.1 years of prodigious effort, our research has failed to discover, or uncover, the real UFO's nature, its origin or intent — and I hasten to add, to force open the door of alleged official secrecy behind which may be concealed the hard evidence, or, if you will, the extraordinary and sobering proof we have all sought, Today, considering the long, evasive history of the UFO and an equally evasive official posture, our research stands at a critical crossroad. Here we find a two-way split off, a growing and sharpening divergence of opinion about the nature and origin of the UFO. One view entertains the notion that the UFO is a paraphysical or physical visitant from another realm or of another dimension and that all the paranormal evidence reportedly associated with the UFO precludes a simple \"nut and bolt\" physical explanation. This hypothesis, in the view of some researchers, rules out the interplanetary \"nut and bolt\" spaceship. The other major hypothesis, and now considered a conservative view, postulates that the .UFO is a structured machine and comes from across the vast reaches FOOTNOTE 1. As presented at the MUFON Symposium, Dayton, Ohio, July 29,1978. Revised from version that appears in the symposium proceedings. 8 of space and time from another solar system. This belief maintains that the extraterrestrial race has, by virtue of its advanced technology, overcome the problem of spatial distance and has developed great psychical powers by which it can manipulate man's mind when it sees fit to do so. Thus, in this postulation, the reported paranormal events can also be explained. Of course, there are many other provocative splinter theories, some interlacing the two major hypotheses and some radically disregarding the known facts. Theories are free, and a dime a dozen. In its honest endeavor to proceed down either hypothetical path, research today continues to investigate UFO reports, correlate and compute the reported data, computerize photographs, conduct conferences and symposia, and drudge over 13,000 UFO reports released by the Air Force's former Project Blue Book which have been made available for public study at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Therefore, it is not by accident that UFO researchers have provided for their brethren a convenient language by which to describe events and, more specifically, a terminology so that UFO reports can be classified. Speaking of terminology, we borrow a page from the eminent Dr. J. Allen Hynek's book, The UFO Experience, A Scientific Inquiry. From this major work, we now have Close Encounters of the First, Second, and Third Kind, which are labels covering a hypothetical set of conditions wherein the human witness observes or experiences a UFO at close range. These include physical or electromagnetic effects to a witness or his surroundings or, an encounter with a strange alien being. Popularized by the movie of the same name, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, has become a household term. Now anybody and everybody can share in an awareness of these rare and bizarre events. But there is another event of the Alien Third Kind. This is an event known mainly through rumor. Even knowledgeable researchers admit they know of it only from shadowy sources, and when pursued, found sudden dead ends. Through patience, perserverence and careful, courteous diplomacy, I have wended my way through the many shadowy mazes and found, to my suprisc, sources of light at many of the so-called dead ends. What I have learned from these sources describes an event which I shall call, Retrievals of The Third Kind. Retrievals of The Third Kind, of course, relate primarily to the alien being. To be more precise, I refer to incidents where a UFO had alledgedly crashed and both it and the occupants were retrived by military personnel who were dispatched to the scene. According to my sources, these immobilized craft and deceased occupants, described as humanoid, have been placed in custody at certain military installations where they were studied under the highest security measures. Now, for the first time, sufficient data have been amassed to lend support to some of the old retrieval claims. But, looking back to the 1950\"s, there was little or no desire then to pursue the reported claims. At that time active researchers, including myself, did little more than scoff. We thought we had good reason. The cause of this \"scoffing\" was one grand hoax. Here, I refer to a book. Behind the Flying Saucers by the late Frank Scully, published in 1950. Briefly, it told about a reported saucer crash in Aztec, New Mexico, in 1948. Scully went on to relate that a scientist he had met had possession of metal artifacts taken from inside the craft, which was proof that the saucer was from outer space. Investigation, however, revealed Scully's scientist was a fraud. With the book's subsequent , exposure as a hoax, which got a lot of publicity, it became unfashionable for any , objective researcher to write or talk about crashed UFOs and their alleged \"little men\". Adding fuel to the fire of a condemned book were strong Air Force denials in 1954 that a retrieved .UFO was in hiding at Wright-Patterson AFB. I remember calling Lt. Colonel John O'Mara, Chief of Intelligence, at the air base, inquiring about the alleged retrievals. His reply, in part, \"Ridiculous!\" So completely was Scully's retrieval story put down that some researchers today wonder, in retrospect, if the book and/or its exposure were contrived But, despite denials and the suspicions of research, the crash and retrieval stories persisted. Then, like a bolt from the blue, while preparing the manuscript for my book Situation Red, The UFO Siege, to be published by Doubleday, some new reliable souces opened up. Then, once again to my surprise, after the release of my book in 1977, still more sources surfaced to talk about what they knew. Then one by one the jigsaw pieces began to fit together and a picture emerged. Now I believe this is the time and certainly the place — Dayton, Ohio, and so close to Wright-Patterson AFB — that we must face this greatest of issues head-on. We must now take a new and honest look at the old rumors. And, we must also take a new look at the possibility of a grand official cover-up and why. If any one of the retrieval incidents is true, or if only one of my informants is tell the truth, then humankind is in for a shock. The impact of its sudden revelation — or forced admission — through official pronouncement probably would shake up man's lifestyle, his philosophies, and even his economy."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"And, if it is true that alien humanoids have been retrieved and are held in a preserved state at one or more military installations, then our government, and all consorting governments, responsible for this concealment will have to explain their policy of prolonged secrecy. We may then rightly ask what else is hidden about the UFO of a more frightening nature? Probably following any official pronouncement of this magnitude, there would .be strong public reaction. There would be demands for more hidden facts, and as always, some one, or some agency, would have to be pinned with the blame. Certainly at the top of the list would be the military establishment, and other covert intelligence agencies. Also to blame would be the media. Where was their prowess to probe for the truth? It seems strange that some of its audacious members who helped bring down a President failed to reach the right people with the right UFO facts — or, where they too, in certain key areas, a part of the big cover-up? And UFO research, too, can share in some of the blame. Too much disunity among the major research groups is one factor. Perhaps a more concerted action would have carried more weight at critical moments when pressures were put to bear in areas of known cover-up. Also, perhaps, too much time has been spent by influential researchers looking for a paranormal answer for the UFO. One fact has stood out for years. The average reported UFO appears to be metallic, structured craft with windows, and, when in a landing position, sometimes uses tripods. While this general description may apply to a vehicle from any other mysterious realm, it does suggest that the design is more a feat of engineering than of psychical or spiritual manifestation. And now for an academic thought. Is it right or wise for research —'or, myself — to try and pry open the lid of a possible Pandora's Box? Is it not morally right to know about the crashed UFO and its alien occupants? Is there something sinister about the continuing surveillance of Earth? And what, you may ask, is my own opinion of my informants endowed with such powerful testimony? Frankly, I cannot refute the credibility of any of my informants. They are from scattered areas, many of whom I have pursued with great effort. Knowing something about the character of each suggests that none is hoaxing, and, it is difficult to believe that any one of them was a \"plant,\" and, even if one or two were, what about the others? And, I may ask, why plant the kind of information that could work against the official position which is to play down the notion of secrecy about UFOs? It is with equal candor that I must state that I am not in a Providential position to pass a positive or final judgment on the retrievals stories or on my informants. On this tenuous ground I must allow for some marginal error in observation or tiny flaw in human judgment for each reported account. However, let me quote an old adage. \"Wherever there is smoke there is fire,\" and from my position I certainly can see a helluva lot of smoke! Now, let me switch from my beliefs to yours and consider' what you may think about me relative to my expose. To help quide your appraisal, allow me to state that I personally have not seen a retrieved UFO, parts of one, or its occupants. Also, for the recor'd, Ido not possess a single affidavit to prove that any one of my informants has seen a retrieved craft or its occupants. I have only their names and their testimony. Unfortunately, I cannot use these names. Anonymity has been requested and will be respected. The reasons should be obvious to all. In essence, therefore, the cases I present in this paper without names to back up the informant's testimony can be construed as hearsay. If perchance, hearsay is to be my undoing, then I must make my stand on the merits of my own credibility which I trust has already been established in my 29 years of UFO research. You are the judge and the jury. I will now proceed with the testimony of my informants concerning Retrievals of the Third Kind in the following abstracts. Abstract I In 1948, according to reports from hazy sources, a UFO with occupants numbering anywhere from one to sixteen,.had crashed in a desert region of the southwestern United States or Mexico and was retrieved by U.S. military authorities. But the reports never got beyond rumor because 1948- was the year when Frank Scully's book unloaded an alleged hoax on the public about a crashed UFO in Aztec, New Mexico. In the Fall of 1977 new word of a 1948 crash came to me from a well-informed military source. His information, however, was scanty. He had heard from other \"inside\" military sources that a metallic disc had crashed somewhere in a desert region. His only details indicated that the craft had suffered severe damage on impact and was retrieved by military units. By coincidence, months later in 1977,1 was to learn more about a crashed disc occurring in 1948. This came from researcher Todd Zechel, whom I had known since 1975 when he became Research Director of Ground Saucer Watch. Formerly with the National Security Agency, Zechel stated that an Air Force technician told him that his uncle, then a Provost Marshal at Carswell Air Force Base near Ft. Worth, Texas, had taken part in the recovery of the crashed . UFO which was described as a metallic disc, 90 feet in diameter. The crash occurred about 30 miles inside the Mexican border across from Laredo, Texas, and was recovered by U .S. troops after it was tracked on radar screens. The job assigned the Provost Marshal, now a retired colonel, was to cordon off the crash site. The retired colonel, now living in Florida, was tracked down by Zechel. Among other facts revealed by the colonel was that one dead alien was found aboard the craft and was described as about 4 feet, 6 inches tall, completely hairless'with hands that had no thumbs. Zechel learned from his source that the troops involved in the retrieval were warned that if they said a word about the incident they would be the \"sorriest people around\". Continuing his investigation, Zechel pieced together other eyewitnesses to the 1948 crash event. In his statement, Zechel relates the following: \"I traced another Air Force colonel, now retired in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He had seen the UFO in flight. He was flying an F-94 fighter out of Dias Air Force base in Texas and was over Albuquerque, New Mexico, when reports came of a UFO on the West Coast, flying over Washington State. Radars clocked its speed at 2,000 miles per hour. It made a 90-degree turn and flew east, over Texas. The colonel, then a captain pilot, actually saw it as it passed. Then suddenly it disappeared from radar screens. At Dias base, the radar operators plotted its course, and decided it had crashed some 30 miles across the Mexican border from Laredo. When the captain got back to base, he and a fellow pilot got into a small plane and took off over the border after the UFO. When they landed in the desert at the crash site, U.S. troops were there before them. The craft was covered with a canopy, and the two pilots were not allowed to see it. They were then called to Washington, D.C., for debriefing and sworn to secrecy about the whole event.\" Zechel also traced a U.S. naval intelligence officer who was in Mexico City at the time of the crash. He was rushed to the spot, but got there just as the craft was being loaded onto military trucks.    ( Comment: Todd Zechel related to me by phone March 15, 1978, that additional details pertinent to this 1948 incident will be made known in his forthcoming book, Under Intelligence Control, to be published in 1978. Zechel also relates that he has a signed affidavit by the retired Air Force Colonel who was involved in the cordoning off operations. Abstract II 1952, the year of the great wave of UFO sightings throughout the U.S.A., can also share in the history of retrieval data. My information for one known UFO crash incident in 1952 comes from a reliable person in a technical position at a large General Electric plant. His brother, who wishes to be unnamed, was on duty as a radar specialist at Edwards Air Force Base, California, in 1952, when he saw a UFO descending toward Earth at great speed across his radar screen. When the UFO had been confirmed to have crashed, the Captain on duty gave him instructions: \"You didn't see anything!\" The specialist a short time later learned from base officials that an unidentified craft did crash in a nearby remote desert area. The retrieved craft was more than 50 feet in diameter with a row of windows around its equator. Its metallic surface was in a burned-blackened condition. He also had heard that the craft was occupied by dead humanoid bodies approximately 4% feet tall. Also, the specialist recalls that he heard reports that the damaged craft was held temporarily in a hanger at Edwards Air Force Base before it was shipped by truck to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Commenf: I had asked my informant if I could discuss this incident with his brother, but when he checked by phone he was reminded that the incident was classified as Secret and he could not be in a position to disclose further details. In (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Retrievals, continued) possible conjunction with this 1952 event, I have talked with two sources who had witnessed a large military vehicle or lo-boy drag (flat-bed truck-Editor), with suspicious cargo under tarpaulin, destined for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. One observer was quartermaster at Godman Field, Kentucky, when the lo-boy, under heavy guard at night, made a transient stop there. Word on the base was that its hidden cargo was a crashed UFO. Another witness, who .had observed a strange cargo being transported on a lo-boy into Wright-Patterson AFB in 1952 were a man and wife, then residing in Circleville, Ohio. By telephone in 1952, they claimed while driving their car near the base that traffic was stalled. Escorting the vehicle, they said, was a motorcade . of military police. Abstract ID Additional testimony in support of a crashed UFO incident in 1952 comes from an unquestionable source: John Schuessler, Deputy Director of MUFON, and engineer for McDonnell Douglas at NASA; his data comes from his father and stepmother, who, equally unquestionable, secured their data in 1968 from an unquestionable first-hand source, who was'their neighbor in a small town in Pennsylvania. According to John Schuessler, his family's close friend was formerly a civilian guard serving at a receiving gate for internal security at Wright- Patterson AFB. While on duty, sometime in 1952, he witnessed a tractor with lo-boy hauling a tarpaulin-covered craft into a tight security area at the base. The guard also had told the Schuessler's that he witnessed at the receiving gate the deceased bodies recovered from the crashed UFO at a site vaguely referred to as somewhere in. the U.S. Southwest. The guard described the bodies, packed in crates, as being \"little people\" or humanoid. It is not known whether or not the bodies arrived at the same time at the base as the craft on the lo-boy or at another time by other means. One point he did make clear about the area in which he worked to the Schuessler's, \"Everything delivered had to pass by me:\" John Schuessler said he tried to folbw up to get more information by arranging a meeting with the former guard through the influence of his parents. But, his efforts were futile. Said John, \"He refused to talk about it, even to me.\" Comment: The brief testimony of the Security Guard at Wright-Patterson AFB and that of the radar specialist at Edwards AFB (cited in Abstract II) suggest that the official cover-up of vital UFO data is so great that some of it which roncems the captive craft and occupants is under a special system of files — and has always been independent of those maintained by Project Blue Book, and, perhaps are without classification so that even the Freedom of Information Act cannot reach them. Probably the area in which the Security Guard had served his tenure of duty from the late 1940's to the mid-1950's, was the same as that referred to by Senator Barry Goldwater in his letter to me dated December 3, 1974, in which he stated....'! made an effort to get in the room at Wright-Patterson where the information was stored, and I was denied that request....\" (Abstract IV deleted in revision.) Abstract V Mr. T., who holds a high technical position in civilian life today, was in the Spring of 1953, at the age of 20, a radar specialist with Secret security clearance. While stationed in Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, in 1953, he and a small, select number of radar specialists were summoned to view a special film at the base theater. Without any briefing, the 16-mm movie projector was flicked on, and the film began to roll on the screen, showing the usual flaws and scratches found in combat photography film. Suddenly, without any titles or credits, or music, there appeared a desert scene dominated by a silver disc-shaped object imbedded in the sand with a domed section at the top. At the bottom was a hatch or door that was open. In.the next scene, Mr. T. recalls seeing 10 to 15 military personnel all dressed in fatigues and all without identification patches, standing around what appeared to be the disabled craft. By judging their height against the UFO, T. determined that its width was approximately 15 to 20 feet. in diameter and that an open hatch or door at the bottom was about 2% feet wide and perhaps 3 feet high. At this point Mr. T. had no idea of the movie's purpose. I asked about the activity of the personnel. \"They were just looking at the object,\" he said. Then the movie switched to what appeared to be the interior of the craft. A panel with a few simple levers was shown, and he remembers being impressed by the muted pastel colors and sudden glares of white — the sign of poor photography. Again there was a change of scenes. Now in view were two tables, probably taken inside a tent, on which, to his surprise, were dead bodies. Two were on one table, and one on another. Mr. T. said the bodies appeared little by human standards and most notable were the heads, all looking alike, and all being large compared to their body sizes. .They looked mongoloid, he thought, with small noses, mouths, and eyes that were shut. He didn't recall seeing ears or hair. The skin, he said, was leathery and ashen in color. Each wore a tight-fitting suit in a pastel cobr. The sight of the dead bodies was the end of the movie. As most military movies credit the Signal Corp or some other source, this one \"stopped cold,\" said Mr. T. When the lights came on in the theater, the officer in charge stood up and instructed the viewers to \"think about the movie,\" and added firmly, \"Don't relate its contents to anyone.\" Mr. T. said that in good faith, he didn't even tell his wife who lived near the base. ToMr.T.'ssurprise.twoweekslaterhewas approached by an Intelligence Officer on the base and told, \"Forget the movie you saw; it was a hoax.\" Shortly after seeing the movie he heard from a couple of top security officers on the base that a UFO had crashed in New Mexico and had been recovered with its occupants. The date of the crash was 1952, said Mr. T. Commented my informant, \"The 5-minute long movie certainly was not a Walt Disney production. It was probably shot by an inexperienced cameraman because it was full of scratches, and poor coloring and texture.\" Mr. T., when asked about his interest in UFOs, claimed that he was not — then or now — interested, but he has always been curious about 'the purpose of the film in relation to his work in radar. Years later, he met an old army acquaintance who also was a radar specialist. To Ts surprise, he learned from this man that he, too, had seen the same film at another base under the same similar hush-hush conditions. Comment: Considering the credibility status of my informant, I believe he saw the movie and describes the subject matter to the best of his recollection. Regarding the subject matter, he believes that the crashed craft and the dead bodies were bona fide. It would have been difficult, even by a major Hollywood studio, to have made dummy bodies look so real for use in an otherwise so make-shift film. And for what morbid purpose? Abstract VI Research Director for MUFON, Raymond E. Fowler of Wenham, Massachusetts, watched incredulously as Fritz Werner signed the following affidavit, dated June 7, 1973: /, Fn'fz Werner, do solemnly swear that during a special assignment with the U.S. Air Force on May 21,1953,1 assisted in the investigation of a crashed unknown object in the vicinity of Kingman, Arizona. The object was constructed of an unfamiliar metal which resembled aluminum. It had impacted 20 inches into the sand without .any sign of structural damage. It was oval and about 30 feet in diameter. An entranceway hatch had been vertically lowered and opened. It was about S'/ifeet high and l'/ 2 feet wide. I was able to talk briefly with someone on the team who did look inside only briefly. He saw two swivel seats, an oval cabin, and a lot of instruments and displays. A tent pitched near the object sheltered the dead remains of the only occupant of the craft. It was about 4 feet tall, dark brown complexion and had 2 eyes, 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and a small round mouth. It was clothed in a silvery, metallic suit and wore a skull cap of the same type of material. It wore no face covering or helmet. I certify that the above statement is true by affixing my signature to this document this 7th day of June, 1973. According to Ray Fowler, a researcher of highest credentials, here is Werner's story: / was project engineer on an Air Force contract with the Atomic Energy Commission from \"Operation Upshot- Knothole\" at the atomic proving ground, Nevada. My job involved the measuring of blast effects on various types of buildings 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"especially erected for the tests. On May 20,' 1953, I worked most of the day at Frenchman Flat. In the evening, I received a phone call from the, test director, Dr. Ed Doll, informing me that I was to go on a special job the next day. On the following day, I reported for special duty and was driven, to Indian Springs Air Force Base, near the proving ground, where I joined about 15 other specialists. We were told to leave all valuables in the custody of the military police. We were then put on a military plane and flown to Phoenix, Arizona. We were not allowed to fraternize. There, we were put on a bus with other personnel, who were already there. The bus windows were blacked out so that we couldn't see where we were going. We rode for an estimated four hours. I think we were in the area of Kingman, Arizona, which is northwest of Phoenix and not too far from the atomic proving ground in Nevada. During the bus trip, we were told by an Air Force full colonel that a super-secret Air Force vehicle had crashed and that, since we were all specialists in certain fields, we were to investigate the crash in terms of our own specialty and nothing more. Finally, the bus stopped and we disembarked one at a time as our names were called and were escorted by military police to the area that we were to inspect. Two spotlights, were centered on the crashed object, which was ringed with guards. The lights were so bright that it was impossible to see the surrounding area. The object was oval and looked like-two deep saucers, one inverted upon the other. It was about 30 feet in diameter, with convex surfaces, top and bottom. These surfaces were about 20 feet in diameter. It was constructed of a dull silver metal, like brushed aluminum. The metal was darker where the saucer \"lips\" formed a rim, around which were what looked like \"slots\". A curved open hatch -door was located on the leading end and was vertically lowered. There was a light coming from inside but it could have been installed by the Air Force. My particular job was to determine, from the angle and depth of impact into the sand, how fast the vehicle's foward and vertical velocities were at the time of impact. The impact had forced the vehicle approximately 20 inches into the sand. There was no landing gear. • There'were also no marks or dents, that I can remember, on the surface — not even scratches. Questions having nothing to do with our own special areas were not answered. An armed military policeman guarded 'a tent pitched nearby. I managed to glance inside at one point and saw the dead body of a four-foot, human-like creature in a silver metallic-looking suit. The skin on its face was dark brown. This may have been caused by exposure to our atmosphere. The face was not covered but it had a metallic skull-cap device on its head. As soon as each person finished his task, he was interviewed over a tape recorder and escorted back to the bus. On the way back to the bus, I managed to talk briefly with someone else going back to it at the same time. He told me that he had glanced inside the object and saw two swivel-like seats, as well as instruments and displays. An airman who noticed we were talking separated us and warned us not to talk with each other. After we all returned to the bus, the Air Force colonel who was in charge had us raise our right hands and take an oath not to reveal what we had experienced. I was • instructed to write my report in longhand and not to type or reproduce it. A telephone number was given me to call when the report was complete. I called the number and an airman picked up the report. Ray Fowler states that Werner held several engineering and management positions at Wright-Patterson AFB between June 1949, and January 1960. During that period, he worked in the Office of Special Studies of what was then the Air Material Command Installations Division. Later, he designed aircraft landing gear and became Chief of alighting devices within the Aircraft Laboratory at Wright Air Development Center. At the time of the alleged incident, he was on assignment to the Atomic Energy Commission at the Atomic Proving Ground in Nevada. Fowler also states that Werner told him that he sympathized with the Air Force's secret handling of the UFO problem and added that the Air Force did not know where UFOs originated. Werner also said that the Air Force believed that the UFOs were interplanetary vehicles but that they did not know how to handle the situation. They did not want to create panic. Comments Fowler: There were inconsistencies in Werner's story, but most appeared to be in the realm of memory lapses and exaggerations by the witness. Former employees that were checked held him in high esteem and all described run as a highly competent and moral individual. Having published a number of technical papers, Werner also holds membership in the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In Fowler's continuing evaluation he cites one piece of evidence which seems to give a strong element of truth to Werner's account. In an attempt to pin down the exact date of the alleged incident, Werner agreed to show his diary he kept in those days. On its aging pages, on May 20, 1953, it read in part: \"Well, pen's out of ink. Spent most of day on Frenchman's Flat surveying cubicles and supervising welding of a plate girder bridge sensor which cracked after last shot...Got funny call from Dr. Doll at 1000. I'm going on a special job tomorrow.\" On May 21st, the 'diary read: \"Up at 7:00. Worked most of day on Frenchman with cubicles. Letter from Bet. She's feeling better now — thank goodness. Got picked up at Indian Springs AFB at 4:30 p.m-. for a job I can't write or talk about.\" Commenf: In my book Situation Red, I cover the Werner story in full based on my conversations with Ray Fowler. Said Fowler, \"With more substantiation, it could blow the lid off secrecy.\" I agree. One. final note: the name Fritz Werner is fictitious, but I feel that his story although embellished, is basically true. One Intelligence source commented, \"A lot of it is story.\" Abstract VII Finally a name of a witness surfaces — an Air Force Major, named Daly — who was a metallurgist stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1953 to relate his adventures with a crashed UFO. The source for this information is fellow Cincinnati-based researcher, Charles Wilhelm. A friend of Charles' father, he related in 1968 that in April of 1953 he was flown to a destination unknown, where it was hot and sandy, to examine the crashed UFO. He was blindfolded and driven to a point about 30 minutes away from a base of operations. There, inside of a tent, standing in soft sand, his blindfold was removed. From there he was taken to a location where he saw a silvery metallic craft about 25 to 30 feet in diameter. The exterior of the craft, he said, was not damaged, however, his on-the : spot two-day analysis of the ship's metal, using the equipment he carried with him, showed that it was not native to Earth. Major Daly, although he was not permitted to enter the craft, observed that the craft's entrance measured 4 to 5 feet high and 2 to 3 feet wide. Commenf: Major Daly's blindfolded trip to the crash site, similar to that of Fritz Werner's, indicates that it was common procedure for the military to use extreme security measures relative to UFO retrievals. It is to be noted that Major Daly's experience takes place in April, a month shy of Fritz Werner's which was in May of the same year. Also, to be noted is that Daly did not see any dead alien bodies. Maybe they had already been removed, or, if the craft was found undamaged, as he attested, it is possible the occupants managed to evade capture. Or, perhaps there were two crashes in a desert area in the Spring of 1953. If, however, both the reports of Werner. and Daly are describing the same crashed UFO event, it is possible that Daly used the wrong month. (continued in next issue) MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

Zigel, his UFO study group leader. NATO Report: UFO Destroys Missiles The following incident is described in a 25 October 1976 NATO document. During the Middle East conflict, a large \"flying saucer\" appeared over one of the military bases of the Atlantic Bloc. Surface-to-air missiles opened fire on it. It was as if the missiles hit a barrier before reaching the UFO; they were destroyed by a beam similar to a laser .beam. A similar incident is cited in the book by the American scholar McCampbell who is studying the UFO problem. During the Vietnam War, a UFO hovered over Hanoi and was fired upon by Vietnamese anti-aircraft gunners who took this craft for a new American aircraft design. A UFO incident in the Atlantic Ocean is on record. The USS Wosk (sic, probably Wasp) was sailing at the head of 12 ships. Its instruments suddenly detected an underwater object which was travelling at a speed of 150 knots. This object accompanied the group of ships for a rather long time in the area of the Atlantic Basin and it was noted on the instruments when it began to dive, up to 6,000 meters below the surface. In October 1976 an article on the sighting of an underwater UFO from the Soviet research ship Vladimir Vorob'yeu, \"The Eight Mysterious Rays,\" was carried in NEDELYA supplement No. 43 to IZVESTIYA. A bright, white spot was circling the ship in a counterclockwise direction at a radius of 150-200 meters; it broke up into eight pieces as if from the effect of the propeller blades. The sonic depth finder fixed it at a depth of 170 meters while at the same time showing the presence of some sort of object under the keel at a depth of approximately 20 meters. A number of similar incidents are summarized in the work \"UFO Phenomena in the Hydrosphere\" which I am supervising. On 27 December, a UFO was sighted near the village of Sosenki- Vatutinki on the Kaluga Highway. A fiery ball which flew along the highway for a distance of 10-15 kilometers was seen from the vehicles travelling on the highway. At one point it became dark and, in the middle of the ball, along its circumference, a number of windows lit up. About 600 : 700 residents of Sosenki provided evidence which was similar to that given by the drivers and passengers of the vehicles which were travelling along this section of the Kaluga Highway at that time. Science Academy UFO Report - There is a work published by the USSR Academy of Sciences for internal use. This is \"UFO Sightings in the USSR.\" The first volume encompasses the period from 1923, including the sightings of N.K. Rerik, and ends in the middle of the Great Patriotic War. The second volume brings it up .to recent years. On page 98 of volume 2, we read the testimony of Comrade Kuprenich regarding two silver-colored UFOs which hovered over the workers village of Usovo, Kuntsevskiy Rayon, Moskovskaya Oblast, near the rail line on 31 July 1969 (according to other data cited in Zigel's lectures, it was on 31 August 1961). Vehicles were sitting in front of the barrier waiting for the electric train to pass; but, even several minutes later, after the barrier opened, they were not able to move from the spot — the ignition did not work. The vehicles were only able to continue on their way when the UFOs disappeared. This is the effect UFOs have on terrestrial equipment. Just recently, during the night of 20 September 1977, a UFO was sighted above Leningradskaya Oblast, Petrozavodsk, and Finland. The sighting over Petrozavodsk was reported by IZVESTIYA in its issue for the provinces on 22 September (TASS) and by SOTSIALISTICHESKAYA INDUSTRIYA on 23 September (a TASS report under the headline \"An Unidentified Natural Phenomenon\"). I can state in more detail that the UFO made a giant figure eight over Pulkov and left a contrail. Travelling at an enormous speed over Leningradskaya Oblast, the UFO stopped over Petrozavodsk where it was observed as a fiery ball; and, while hovering over the city, it deployed eight \"petals\" — beams which stretched downward. It was a fiery \"downpour\" with a shaft in the center. 'This shaft looked like a sounding balloon and it flew along Lenin Avenue. Before this UFO returned to its Medusa form, many of the residents woke up experiencing a feeling of fear. \"We were afraid,\" said the people who observed this phenomenon on the street. (This case has been attributed to a Russian rocket launch by James Oberg.—Editor.) This object, which also flew over Lake Onega, was seen from a ship of the Volga-Baltic Line. A smaller object separated from the UFO in the area of the Lake. The fiery ball was also seen over Helsinki. Rumors spread that the Soviet Union was testing a new weapon over the capitals of the European states; this led to the usual military hysteria in the the U.S. and NATO and to increased discussions about the need to speed up production of the neutron bomb. In their turn, some of the people on our side decided that what had happened over Petrozavodsk and Lake Onega was an American test of the neutron bomb and it's delivery system. But, of course, it was nothing of the, kind. Our military knows how to distinguish UFOs from space vehicles and aircraft which are launched by earthlings. This is why the military units of the border zone did not open fire on the object which hovered over Petrozavodsk. For each of us, the chance of an encounter with such a vehicle is exactly 0.05 percent throughout our lifetime. During the past 30 years, the Americans have counted the appearance of 80,000 vehicles above the earth. The Swedes have recorded 900 UFOs just over Scandanavia. We have 1,500 incidents of UFO sightings over the Soviet Union. Since wishful thinking is frequently mistaken for reality and since different celestial phenomena can be taken as UFOs, American scientists, for example, selected 80,000 of the most reliable and firm evidence from the 15 million UFO sightings for the past 30 years. In 80 percent of the cases, the UFOs glowed with a bright light. In 20 percent of the cases, they had a dark body with a metallic sheen. As a rule, 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"the UFOs are wrapped in a fiery plasma cloud. This makes photography difficult. It has been observed that they are the color of a welding arc during rapid flight. At slower speeds, they are light blue in color, etc. But, it also happens that the UFO glows with a bright light while hovering over a particular area. It is possible that, with the assistance of ions, a breakdown of elementary particles takes place within the plasma cloud and a complete vacuum forms in front of the UFO; this vacuum enables the vehicle to fly at unprecedented speeds. The UFO creates a vacuum for itself with its own technical equipment. The majority of the vehicles are shaped like an inverted saucer of a silvery, aluminum color. The \"saucer\" has windows and three landing \"legs\"; judging from their imprints, the legs are a simple arrangement, sort of like \"skis\" which are let down in the form of a letter \"H\" with a line through it: three straight \"shafts\" lengthwise and one across the middle. Sometimes a UFO will land directly on its frame. The upper or lower half of the UFO is frequently transparent. As a rule, a green liquid is found in the imprints left by the UFO on the ground. Not a single plant will grow on this spot. It is possible that the green liquid protects the UFO from terrestrial bacteria. Not far from Borisoglebsk, servicemen of the Soviet Army saw a UFO with a semicircular canopy; it was flying from one side of the highway to the other. Two figures were visible under the transparent canopy; they were indistinguishable from human figures. One of the figures was leaning on his hand — which had five fingers — on the inside of the semicircle. The journalist Strel'nikov described a UFO sighting at Khantymansiysk in PRAVDIST, a trade newspaper for the employees of PRAVDA. The shape of the vehicle resembled a gigantic electric light bulb. There are different\" UFO shapes. Usually they are an inverted saucer with a flat, rotating body; sometimes they are a cylinder or a triangle with a body shaped like a lampshade. There are different sizes of UFOs. Usually, the body is 30, 40, 50 or 80 meters in diameter. The powerplant for a vehicle like this is enormous. Recently, a body like this flew alongside the motor ship Nikolay Ostrovskiy for a period of 36 minutes. A UFO was seen over Putivl' in Sumskaya Oblast. It was a cylinder 300 meters in size. The vehicle hovered over Putivl' twice for 2 to 2% hours each time. It deployed 10-12 smaller UFOs from the inside. A military unit located in this area made the sighting of this vehicle. This happened this year, in 1977. Sailors of the Pacific Ocean Fleet also made a sighting of a gigantic cylinder in another place. Several small objects which separated from the cylinder flew .at a distance of 10-12 kilometers from the cylinder. UFO Movies by Apollo Astronauts The American astronauts who visited the Moon saw a gigantic cylinder 1,500 meters long there. Aldrin shot it on movie film. The vehicle accomplished its own interaction with Apollo; it coordinated its movement with it. The UFOs develop a speed from 0 to 72,000 kilometers per hour within the earth's atmosphere. They are able to abruptly change their flight orbit and fly in jerks by making zigzag movements, while going from one point to another at remarkable speeds in this fashion. In mathematics, these movements are called \"undulations.\" The UFO slowly lifts off to an altitude of 30-40 meters and then immediately develops an extraordinary speed which no terrestrial aircraft can approach. Sometimes, the plasma cloud around the UFO takes the shape of a \"small sickle.\" In 1974, a UFO observation station was set up in the U.S., or rather, a station for \"attracting\" UFOs. The station shines beams into the sky from 100 searchlights of a million watts each. A UFO visited the station; it made two turns over it and was flying at a speed of 16,000 kilometers per hour. (This paragraph apparently refers to the field laboratory of Project Starlight International near Austin, Texas. It is inaccurate regarding the lighting system and power level. A widely distributed photograph was taken there showing a track with two sharp turns. While consulting for PSI, however, I performed a vector analysis showing that the photo was compatible with a small, sudden displacement of the camera. The photographer, in fact, had indicated concern that he might have bumped his tripod during the time exposure. Ray Stanford has since confirmed this fact.-J. McCampbell) In the U.S. and other countries, UFOs have flown over lots of people at an altitude of 30 meters. There have been cases of undesirable effects from these vehicles: people have been burned and been temporarily paralyzed while being fully conscious; some people close to UFOs have experienced sharp pains, electrical shocks, loss of sight, etc. The American scientist McCampbell also wrote about this. We hope that his monograph on UFOs will be published in 1978. The spectrum of a UFO was measured near Cuba and it was established that its frequency was approximately 3,000 megahertz. The hypothesis was put forward that UFOs carry an electromagnetic field. The UFOs were built -by an extraterrestrial civilization not during the present time but in age-old antiquity by earth standards. The Bible mentions these phenomena. In the distant past, they caused flare-ups of religious cults. In the papyrus of Thutmose HI, a Pharaoh of the XVIII dynasty, there is a description of a UFO which appeared over his army. The pharaoh describes the event father clearly in practical concepts for those times. In the chronicles of Alexander of Macedonia, there is a story about a massive flight of UFOs while his army was crossing the Tigrus and Euphrates. Aristotle called UFOs \"celestial discs.\" Pliny, the naturalist, also mentions them. McCampbell provided a systematic analysis of 1,000 UFO landings and 100 cases of contacts between their pilots and earthlings. In 40 percent of the cases, the UFO pilots are completely like 'us in height and build (giants over 2 to 2 l / 2 meters tall rarely show up). Tsiolkovskiy is correct; in the work \"The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces,\" he expressed the idea that intelligent inhabitants of other planets must look like us. (Continued on next page) 1 _"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Russia, continued) The UFO pilots are distinguished by their athletic build. They have rather mobile and static features. They hardly reflect any emotion. There is only one recorded instance where a smile flashed across their faces when an Italian peasant woman went to meet the pilots, who had landed in a field, with a bouquet of flowers. As a rule, the pilots avoid contacts with people. Female crews have also been seen. One of the female pilot's hair hung down to her knees. All of the UFO pilots wore spacesuits which encompassed their bodies. Some did not wear pressure suits, others did. In 60 percent of the cases, the pilots were dwarfs with large heads, with two holes in their face instead of a nose and with deep-set eyes. They had disproportionately long arms and legs and their height did not exceed 1m 10 cm. \"Little men\" 33 .cm tall have also been seen. The dwarfs also wore spacesuits; but, they were seen more frequently in pressure suits than were the representatives of the previous group of pilots. But, after all, tribes of pigmys also live alongside tribes of tall and medium-sized people on earth. While not displaying any special interest in the people they meet, the UFO pilots (who are sometimes called \"humanoids\") do display a certain humaneness. They do not respond to firing on their vehicles by killing people; they do not harm people during their encounters; they do not display any aggressiveness at all. Extraterrestrial Life A lot of technical, as well as philosophical, questions have sprung up among scientists as a result of the arrival of extraterrestrial beings, in general, because it represents intelligent life in space. In issue No. 9 of the journal VOPROSY FILOSOFII and in several other issues of the journal, the Soviet astrophysicist I. Shkolvskiy expressed the opinion that intelligence and life on earth are unique and it would be impossible to find anything like it for hundred of light years on other planets. According to Shklovskiy, if there was another similar civilization close to ours, it would have made contact with earthlings a long time ago by using the radio, like we have. After declaring that intelligence on earth is a unique and very rare occurrence in the universe, Shklovskiy philosophizes on the topic that earthlings are responsible for an enormous part of the universe; they can consider it their own, settle it, etc. However, first, it is not absolutely mandatory for another civilization to make contact with ours. It is possible that they are examining us like we examine ants. Second, this civilization could have communications equipment which far exceeds the radio in its speed of' receiving and transmitting information and which is still not accessible to us at the present time. Third, this civilization could have developed on a completely different basis than ours (for example, on a technocratic basis) and the differences are so great that contacts are either impossible or premature. At any rate, sooner or later, contact with another civilization will basically have enormous consequences for earthlings. In a conversation with Lenin published in his reminiscences, Herbert Wells states that, when the conversation touched upon extraterrestrial civilizations, Lenin said that an encounter between them and earthlings would be the greatest revolution in life, natural science, and philosophy. This part of the conversation was not reflected in Wells' book \"Russia in Darkness.\" Perhaps a society which has surpassed us has finer physical fields than we do. Let's just take the problem of the speed of light. For their experimental discovery of speeds which exceed the speed of light by a factor of ten (10 C) which was made in 1971 as a result of the observation of quasars, 21 American scientists were awarded the supreme Rumford Prize. Academician Al'bert losifovich Veynik of the Belorussian SSR Academy of Sciences proved the possibility of speeds above the speed of light. By means of an in-depth mathematical analysis, he arrived at the conclusion that speeds which exceed the speed of light by a factor of 7,000, i.e., 2.1 billion kilometers per second, are possible in a space vacuum. In his work on thermal dynamics which was published in 1974, Veynik developed his theory on the six material, physical fields which comprise the basis of the world. Three of them are known to earth science; the three finer ones are still not known. His works on the photon's mass — and his attempt to create a unified theory for a unified physical field which includes the electromagnetic, gravitational and nuclear fields, where one of the three vectors compensates for the others — are interesting. Veynik believes that a space vacuum is a special form of matter's existence and movement. Moreover, the smaller the particles, the more powerful their bonds are. Thus, the vacuum can give birth to energy with enormous power. From this, it is possible that extraterrestrial beings are using other means of communications which are many times more efficient than radio waves. According to Veynik, if speeds of 2.1 billion kilometers per second (7,000 times faster than light) exist, we could fly to a planet located 30 light years away from us in 1.8 earth days. It is possible that these speeds are within reach of the UFOs. Everything that we have stated above shows that mankind on earth is far from being alone in the universe and it cannot claim \"control\" of a large part of the visible universe or metagalaxy. In order to come up to a level with other, higher extraterrestrial civilizations, mankind must first put an end to its atavistic social institutions of . the capitalist type, destructive wars, and the power of imperialist monopolies. Several hypotheses exist for the origin of UFOs: the - \"mountain\" hypothesis of N.K. Rerik, the ocean hypothesis, the space hypothesis.... The majority now adheres to the space hypothesis. UFOs are a product of an extraterrestrial civilization. Incidentally, more on the antiquity of UFOs (by earth standards). In the Tret'yakov Gallery, there is an ancient icon on display with a \"flying saucer\" depicted off to the side of the main drawing.... Like any mechanism, UFOs have breakdowns. Pilots have been observed hustling about a UFO with smoke coming out of it. A UFO landed on White Lake in Vologodskaya 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Oblast. The vehicle dove to the bottom and, based on several signs, it remained in an emergency situation for days. When it surfaced from the lake after the repairs, it tore off a huge chunk of the bank and lifted it up during its take off. It would have taken an astronomical number of excavators to dp this work. Sometimes the UFQs throw off a fibrous liquid which has received the name \"angel's hair.\" In the USSR, 7-8 scientific institutes undertook an analysis of it. The Soviet scientist Sokolov-Petryanov stated that this liquid is a combination of boron and silica which still cannot be duplicated in earth laboratories. UFOs have exploded over the ocean, naturally without leaving any . trace. But, fragments of the body were preserved in an explosion over northern Brazil. An analysis of the metal showed that it is an alloy of magnesium oxide and strontium which is also not within reach of production on earth at present. Its specific gravity is 1.86. Kh. Piccard (sic, probably J. Piccard) described a UFO; it passed near his underwater vehicle. While telling about his trip on the Kon-Tiki, Thor Heyerdahl mentioned a UFO which surfaced in front of his sounding line and was as bright as the sun. Mankind a Risk? Our civilization so far has not known the grief of a nuclear catastrophe but it can cause irreparable disaster/Even N.K. Rerik, and recently I.L. Leonov, warned us about this; they were warning all the progressive people on earth. It is possible that the UFO flights to earth are explained by the fact that mankind is \"an explosive risk\" for space. The civilization which created the UFOs is looking for a way to make the earth safe and, possibly at the same time, a significant part of the galaxy, where the balance can be destroyed by this, by threat of a catastophe. There is also another hypothesis: mankind on earth is radiating psychic energy into space. Such a strong radiation is frequently the result of stress. The psychic energy, the Psi field, continues an independent existence in space and diffuses. This disturbs and upsets the extraterrestrial beings. A lot of this does not fit into the framework of our usual thinking. After all, for a long time, we did not recognize plasma as a state of matter. And, to this day, students are taught that the speed of light is the limit for physical speeds. • What will the majority of the professors do if the opposite is discovered? Our respected astrophysicist I. Shklovskiy has displayed inconsistency in his views. In the 5 July 1976 PRAVDA, he and Candidate for Physicomathe- matical Sciences Matveyenko published an article \"The View from Three Continents\" where they declared that the speed of the relativistic particles emitted by the quasars reaches 10 times the speed of light (10 C), but he has renounced these views in subsequent works.... The late Minister Loginov distributed tables with drawings and descriptions of different types of UFOs, which he received from abroad, to all the aviation institutes. This has probably already been of use to the aircraft designers. Edward Condon, the chairman of the UFO committee who finished his work in the beginning of 1968 and \"declared\" that a significant part of the UFOs were optical illusions in the atmosphere, admitted before his death that the CIA demanded this conclusion from him in spite of the facts. (There is no known documentation for this assertion.- Editor) In the near future, the population of the Soviet Union will apparently be significantly more widely informed about UFOs. There is a vast, serious literature on this score abroad (and not just cheap, trashy books filled with cheap sensation). I will cite the book of the honored French academician, Jacques Berzhe (sic; probably Bergier), on UFOs, the book of Master Shatelen (?; sic) \"Our Ancestors Came From Outer Space\" and McCampbelPs monograph. I hope they will be published in 1978. A question arises at this point on Adamski's book which was published in the U.S. at one time. He tells about his 10-day visit to Venus where he was supposedly taken by a UFO crew. I am very cautious about this book. But, I must say that the story could have been just as successful about another planet where an \"earthling\" was taken. The book is interesting because the author depicts the extraterrestrial beings as free and happy people who have lived for thousands of years and who have, strictly speaking, a communist system at the highest stage of development. To Adamski's question on the people's longevity, the scientists of this planet replied that the duration of life must be sought in the way of life itself. Adamski compromised himself and his book somewhat by the fact that he supposedly received instructions from the \"flying saucer\" civilization on how to predict earthquakes and other natural disasters on earth; he made mistakes and became an inveterate liar. \"...there are other , spaceships observing us.\" The previously mentioned reports of the American astronauts who visited the Moon are exceptionally interesting. Their agreed-upon code for designating UFOs was the phrase \"Saint Nicholas,\" but, they were so amazed with what they saw when they arrived on the Moon from Apollo that they transmitted to earth without the code: \"Directly across from us, on the other side of the crater, there are other spaceships observing us.\" And Aldrin shot his film which shows the UFOs on the Moon. I hope you will also be able to see it in 1978. Apollo left a capsule on the Moon with the texts — in 72 languages — of the UN Declaration on Human Rights and the International Agreement on Space and Celestial Bodies, etc., but, in the sense of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, this effort has not had any success yet. It was kept secret, but the company which prepared the capsule and the texts talked about it to the press. The Moon is evidently a transhipment base for UFOs and every Apollo which has, flown to the Moon has been under the \"observation\" canopy of the UFOs. It was not by accident that the American astronauts were not successful in their attempt to explode a nuclear device for scientific purposes on the Moon. Instead, the oxygen cylinder on Apollo exploded. They were also not able to blow up the upper (continued on next page) ^5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\\ UFO TECH NOTE By John F. Schuessler During the past several years a number of scientists, researchers, and politicians have suggested the utilization of the North American Air Defense Command's (NORAD) Baker- Nunn space cameras to record UFO data. The Baker-Nunn is a 6000-pound film camera system that can track and photograph those satellites which are too small or too far out in space to be observed by the radar and telemetric elements of the NORAD system. These units were located at Edwards Air Force Base in California, San Vito dei Normanni in Italy, Sand Island in the Central Pacific, on Mt. John in New Zealand, and at Cold Lake in Alberta, Canada. The Baker-Nunn is said to have the capability of tracking a speeding bullet at 200 miles. It is easy to speculate on a number of potential UFO tracking applications for this system. Now Baker-Nunn is obsolete. A new five-site system; .with 40-inch telescopes, video cameras, and digital computers will be installed at White Sands, N.M., Hawaii, Korea, North Africa, and in the Middle East. The new system — called ground-based electro- optical deep space surveillance (GEODSS) — has been designed to provide both increased sensitivity in its detection of objects and increased speed with which the data can be analyzed. The GEODSS will be able to detect objects on the order of 1 square meter at 20,000 nautical miles altitude reflecting 10 percent of its light. An automatic moving target indicator makes the GEODSS ideal for tracking space objects, including UFOs. Additional information can be found in Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine, May 22, 1978. 16 (Russia, continued) stage of the booster and so it continues to fly around the Moon. The attention devoted to UFOs in other countries is very great. For example, in France, a special UFO center and airport were built in Toulouse on 20 April 1977, Throughout the world, there have been 100 cases of people being kidnapped by UFO crews (real or made up cases) over a 30-year period. For example, there is a well known case in the U.S. where the Hill's, husband and wife, were drawn from their automobile by means of hypnosis (sic) into a \"flying saucer\" where they were examined by different monitoring units. Mrs. Hill remembered a map with a picture of 21 stars on a background which was streaked with copper. Subsequently, after a very long study of stellar maps by experts, a group of astronomers came to the conclusion that the stellar sky is seen like this from a star which is 30 light years away from us and which is located in the Reticulumconstellation... The last time a UFO was seen in the USSR was a month ago (October 1977) near the village of Sharapova Ikhota near Serpukhov. Now, let's look at slides with pictures of UFOs and their crews. I will answer the notes (on answers to several questions). A question on the opinion of the USSR Academy of Sciences Council on Astronomy. Academician Artsimovich, its deceased chairman, was led astray by Menzel's book- and by Condon's conclusion which was made under CIA orders. Therefore, Artsimpvich came out against UFOs. A question on the Tunguska \"meteorite.\" It manuevered over the area. In my opinion, it was a UFO. A question on the UN's attitude to the problem. The tiny island-state Grenada is in the island group of the Lesser Antilles in the Atlantic Ocean. Grenada is a member of the UN. Because UFOs frequently fly to this small tropical island, the government of Grenada suggested that the UN (and it distributed the appropriate paperwork among the delegations) declare 1978 the year of the \"flying saucer\" and that, in their honor, they issue special postage stamps and postcards, literature popularizing them, etc. We will see what the results of this proposal will be. A question on how to take the article by science fiction writer Yeremey Parnov in KOMSOMOL'- SKAYA PRAVDA on 23 November 1976, which criticizes a lecture on UFOs at the Coulomb MMZ (meaning of acronym unknown-Editor). I think that Parnov did not act properly. With a synopsis of Zigel's lecture in his hands which was compiled by somebody, not without inaccuracies and distortions (such synopses are even sold at the \"carry-in\" market in Odessa for 5 rubles apiece), Yeremey Parnov called up Zigel and asked him if he really gave a lecture on this topic. Zigel confirmed it. Then, Parnov, with the paltry knowledge he had acquired, criticized this synopsis in the newspaper; it was not even corrected by Zigel. A question on our pilots who have seen UFOs. There are such pilots. Valentin Ivanovich Akkuratov, a senior navigator of polar aviation who is well known by everybody, wrote four reports to the Ministry of Civil Aviation on his encounters with UFOs. Now, about radars. Unfortunately, radars seldom locate UFOs. Altogether, five cases out of a hundred. (A few hundred radar UFO cases are known in the United States.-Editor) (A Washington, D.C., news source, who is checking on other aspects of this report, has informed me that the statements attributed to Astronaut Buzz Aldrin about UFOs on the Moon were confirmed by his news bureau's space reporter, who eovered the Apollo story at the time. Aldrin said them as a joke. It is possible that the story filtered through to the Soviet Union in garbled form, as is evident in some other cases. Other portions of this report still may be significant, and we will continue to seek verification of them.—Editor) MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

Details are not now available.\" I hasten to correct this misstatement: the report of a hoax was an unfounded rumor, and I am guilty of having repeated it without checking further. In addition, the correct date for this case is September 15, 1977--nof September 30. Mrs. Irene Granchi, a veteran UFO investigator from Rio de Janeiro, was one of two well-known investigators who checked on this unusual report in great detail. An independent inquiry was conducted by Dr. Walter Buhler, whose report was published in the SBEDV Bulletin, No. 121/125 (March-December, 1978). Both investigators concluded independently that the abduction report by Antonio Bogado La Rubia was genuine. Mrs. Granchi's full report was published in the Canadian UFO Report, Vol. IV, No. 7 (Summer, 1978); in addition, her report formed the basis for an article by Coral Lorenzen, entitled \"UFO Abduction in Brazil,\" which was published in Fate Magazine, July 1978, pp. 48-54. In an understandably exasperated letter to me dated August 8,1978,'Mrs. Granchi writes, in part: \"I lay here my vehement protest to your irresponsible statement. Rumor-mongering is not my cup of tea!...Neither I, nor Dr. Buhler, knew of each other's report before it was published. I endorse what I said in my article, \"Antonio's Ordeal\" (pp. 13-19), in the Canadian UFO Report, cited above-tb). I have nothing to add - or to subtract. It is shameful to even think of making an insinuation such as yours'. I shall, after this, read what you write about other cases with a grain of salt.\" 18 North Carolina Projects George D. Fawcett, State Director for North Carolina, has a study project on \"Human Reactions to UFOs.\" \"I am trying to find out the first thing a person does after his UFO encounter, or shortly thereafter,\" Fawcett says. \"This is a human interest angle, which I believe will tell us a great deal about the truth or falsity of a UFO experience.\" Some examples he has received to date are: \"My favorite pipe dropped out of my mouth and floated down the Delaware River...\" \"We went out night after night to the same area to see if the UFOs would return...\" \"I checked out all the books at the local library to try to learn more about the UFO subject.:.\"'' \"We all started chain smoking or drinking heavily and tried to forget our UFO encounter...\" \"My wife and I attended programs at the local science museums and . planetariums, in an effort to find out more about where these things (UFOs) might come from...\" \"We stayed up all night discussing our UFO experience and trying to make sense out of the whole bewildering UFO sighting...\" Mr. Fawcett will be giving his 3%- hour illustrated UFO lecture \"UFOs and UFOnauts\" at the P.E. Monroe Auditorium, Lenior Rhyne College in Hickory, North Carolina, on Thursday night, November 16 at 7:30 PM. The program will be open to students, faculty, and the public. I stand properly rebuked. I apologize to Mrs. Granchi for having impugned her integrity as an investigator. I have read her reports in the APRO Bulletin and elsewhere for years, and I know them to be the very models of conscientiousness and documentation.
