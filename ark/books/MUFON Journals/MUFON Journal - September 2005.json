Source of initial report: Peter Dav- enport, National UFO Reporting Cen- ter (NUFORP) Investigated by: Steven Reichmuth, MUFON Field Investigator & State Section Director Alameda County, CA Evaluation: significant; CE-1. The witness report \"\"While traveling on 1-680 South, I took the Dublin Blvd. exit to stop at a gas station. As I was taking the exit, there is a car dealership located right at the curve. I was talking to my daughter on the cell phone and noticed a gold object, shaped like a saucer, which had a lighted dome and muted colored lights at the bottom. It was huge and situated behind the bright lights of the car lot. At first I thought it was a gimmick to attract cus- tomers to the dealership. Then it moved very slowly, coasting back and forth from left to right. I screamed as I real- ized it was the real thing ... a UFO. \"I parked my car and had a better view. I described it to my daughter and said I wish I had a camera so I can show her how it looks. I've had a camera phone but never used it, so I completely forgot I had a camera until my daugh- ter mentioned it. \"I drove out of the parking lot and told my daughter I was going to take a snapshot of it. As I moved closer to the object, in a matter of 3-4 seconds it faded and disappeared in the night sky.\" Impressions/evaluations Witness(s): The witness, 44, is a college graduate and works as an ex- ecutive assistant to the CEO of a local firm. She does not want her name pub- licized at this time. She is a mature pro- September 2005 Composite illustration by investigator Steve Reichmuth. fessional woman of good character, de- termined, persistent, polite, calm, intel- ligent, and curious. The witness is interested in UFOs, but is not versed in their details. For the initial interview with me she went to considerable time and trouble to drive the distance with her three chil- dren along, unable to find a sitter. She felt it was that important to her. Both Ruben Uriarte, State Director, for Northern California, and I have met with her, and neither of us has any rea- son to feel she is untruthful or has cre- ated a hoax. The witness reported that no one else apparently saw the object. She gave clear specific descriptions, and has not wavered in any details of the case. The witness was alone at the time of the sighting. She was, however, in voice communication with her daugh- ter, 16, who was at home (the family was then living in Tracy, CA) via cell phone during the entire experience. Her daughter, like her mother, is of good character. The witness said viewing the object frightened her, and upon being asked by me, she admitted it was also \"beau- tiful\" to look at. She had never seen MUFON UFO Journal such an object before, and states she has changed her opinion about the pos- sibility of the existence of such objects. She has not confided her experience to others except a few trusted close friends, and says the sighting has at times made her feel isolated, not being able to share her experience with very many others. Weather: The witness reported that the weather that night consisted of a high ceiling overcast. The sky appeared clear at low to medium altitudes. There was some light pollution. No stars were visible. I have taken images of the area under the same lighting conditions (6:45 PM PDT), and attached images to this report. Size of object: The object was about the size of a softball at arm's length. Since it was low to the ground, possi- bly over the car dealership, and was viewed from two different positions (see triangulation map), a size of 56 feet in diameter could be estimated, al- though the witness was not completely sure of distance. Description of object: The object had a radiant white dome, and the disc itself seemed a gold or copper color with a smooth definite outer structure"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"with panel lines. The body of the craft did not emit any light or plasma field, but just below the object the witness observed what appeared to her as a glowing aura all along the object's bot- tom. This aura was glowing red, orange, and yellow-or shades intermixed. The presence of orange and red plasmas with hovering UFOs is consistent with other such reports of craft seen close. I consider this case a Close Encoun- ter of the 1st kind (CE-1) according to the Hynek-Vallee classification system. The Stone Ridge Chrysler-Ply- mouth-Jeep car dealership salespeople reported nothing unusual seen, heard, or felt. There were no other reports, despite the object's close proximity to a busy freeway intersection (Hwy 580 & HWY 680 in Dublin). A few com- mercial stores in the area were checked, but nothing unusual was seen. Many at the dealership suggested it was the Saturn blimp aircraft which frequented the area during this time I determined that the Saturn adver- tising blimp was in the Livermore/ Pleasanton area, flying there in the eve- nings (in between sports telecasts fly- ing over the Oakland Coliseum) be- tween late October and December 2004). The Saturn blimp was based at that time at Livermore Municipal airport. I contacted via the Livermore airport manager's office the two pilots who fly this blimp, chief pilot Charles Halbrooke and pilot Doug McFadden. Both were very polite and friendly, and remarked that they frequently receive such UFO inquiries. The chief pilot checked his flight log book and reported he was indeed fly- ing the Saturn blimp that evening. It was airborne at the time of the dealership sighting (18:45 hours). He reported seeing nothing unusual. The minimum operating altitude re- quired by FAA for such blimps is 1,000 ft. The pilot reported they were having trouble with their on-board electrical generator, which provided electrical power for night-time illumination of the blimp interior for visual advertising. The APU (auxiliary power unit) is gravity fed with fuel, and will some- times stall out (causing the blimp inte- Original sketch by witness.

This a good note for future MUFON cases involving blimp aircraft as well. The witness is very adamant that the object seen was not a blimp. I telephoned my contact at the Oak- land Air Traffic Control Center, and was referred to the \"Nor Cal\" air traf- fic control center near Sacramento (ra- dar situated on former Nather Air Force base). The Oakland Center, though geo- graphically closer to the event (Dublin), is blind on their radars at the low alti- tudes, due to hills between Oakland Center (located near Hayward, CA) and Dublin. My contact at Oakland Center, Peter \"Pete\" Marcuso, chief air traffic controller, said to contact his friend personally at \"Nor Cal.\" This traffic controller contact, who MUFON UFO Journal wishes to remain anonymous, reported the radar data at Nor Cal and other con- trol centers are kept for a only a limited time in their computers, but Nor Cal was able to report they had some sort of computer record of a Saturn Blimp radar transponder which pinpointed the blimp at 18:45 hours (6:45 PM) near Livermore-some 7 to 10 miles east of Dublin-at the time of the sighting. No other anomalous radar returns were re- ported. This seemed to provide some very important independent confirmation that, whatever my witness had seen, it was not a blimp. Her daughter had urged her to try to photograph the object with her cell phone. The witness was inexperienced with the cell phone camera device. During the sighting the witness was able to drive to a nearby store parking lot facing the auto dealership and watch the object hovering without distraction or interruption for some 3 to 4 minutes (a long time). She started the car with no difficulty, and she pulled into the intersection to get closer for a photograph. The object seemed (she thought) to sense her pres- ence, and when she tried to take a photo the object silently darted away at very rapid speed-gone in 3 to 4 seconds in a steep climb away from witness toward the south-southeast (toward east Pleasanton). The Dublin Police Dept. was con- tacted by telephone on Dec. 7, 2004. They were courteous and prompt (and naturally curious). The Watch Sergeant the next day contacted all officers on duty that night (Nov. 5,2004). The police computer log was also checked, and nothing unusual was re- ported or telephoned into the police sta- tion from anywhere in Dublin that night. Sergeant Peccaro left a message on my personal home answering machine 24 hours later. On June 10,2005,1 was introduced by Ruben Uriarte to a notable police forensic artist now retired from the San Jose Police Department, Tom Macris. Using remarkable communication techniques as well as artistic ability, he was able to create an additional draw- ing for added perspective and possible insight on the case.

Klass dead at 86 Philip J. Klass, senior editor at Avia- tion Week and Space Technology for 35 years, fellow of CSICOP, and arch debunker of UFO phenomena, has died at the age of 86. Dr. Bruce Maccabee comments: \"Phil's UFO legacy is simple: he almost single-handedly managed to set ufology back perhaps 30 years by making him- self available to the press as a credible UFO skeptic who was sufficiently knowledgeable about the subject to write books about UFOs-books that were generally endorsed by the scien- tific community.... \"Yet, I thank him for my education in UFO investigation. Without his con- tinual prodding when I was investigat- ing Trent and New Zealand I wouldn't have become as effective in acting like a 'lawyer for the defense.'\" MUFON UFO Journal Val Johnson case Ted Philips recounted in his column the Val Johnson UFO-police car colli- sion case in Minnesota. Few people probably know that there may have been a witness to the same object that night. A longtime acquaintance of mine, having seen me on TV, told me of his sighting after being silent for about a decade. He had become an archaeologist, but was a musician returning from a Sun- day \"gig\" in the Minneapolis area (note this is the opposite side of the state) to Milwaukee when he saw an object in the sky \"as bright as a welder's torch.\" He described its motion as the tradi- tional \"falling-leaf' flutter, although he used hand motion to describe it, and didn't immediately recognize the term. He noted where it dropped below the treeline, estimated a distance, pulled off the freeway to investigate, but came to a 5-way intersection and recognized he'd only get lost. He did not note the time, although it was well past mid- night. Returning to Milwaukee, he watched the newspapers & read of the Johnson case at about the same time being in- vestigated by \"some group in Chicago\" (presumably CUFOS). Feeling his sighting would be taken as seriously as from a \"pot-smoking musician,\" he never came forward until his report to me. -Jeff Sainio MUFON Staff Photoanalyst Friedman critic Stanton Friedman is beginning to sound like a \"jealous ninny.\" His at- tack on Dr. Steven Greer was way over the top. There are men of science in Dr. Greer's book Disclosure who have given him information on back engi- neered free energy. You can't blame Dr. Greer for funds he needs to carry on his work. I have a tape of Stanton Friedman's and it was not free. He should spend more of his time investigating the U.S. Patent Of- fice. -J.M. Aldridge"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Secrecy, UFOs, and the death of the American Republic, Part 2 By Richard M. Dolan [Editor's Note: Last month, in Part One, Dolan discussed the reality of the UFO phenomenon, how the govern- ment is mishandling it, and the specu- lation that UFOs might be the products of for- eign develop- ments, our own advanced re- search, or even a rogue human group with ad- vanced technol- ogy.] Then there is the more radical Richard Dolan interpretation, which is that this technology wasn't human in origin at all. Either way, this was clearly a seri- ous matter to serious people. H. Marshall Chadwell, for instance, who was the CIA's Deputy Director of Sci- entific Intelligence. By 1952, when UFO sightings were getting rather out of hand, and not just the public but military personnel were encountering these things with incred- ible frequency, we can imagine the con- cern that was generated at high levels. Only a handful of documents have come down to us from that period: some books, a few reports, and memos. One of them, however, speaks vol- umes. It's a brief document, prepared by Chadwell for his boss, CIA Direc- tor Walter Bedell Smith. It was dated Dec. 2, 1952. Chadwell was careful. He didn't come out and say, \"Boss, we're being invaded.\" Here is the rel- evant paragraph: \"At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something go- ing on that must have immediate attention....Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and travelling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.\" Not natural phenomena, not known types of vehicles, and not (apparently) U.S. manufactured. It didn't appear to be Soviet. So what does that leave you with? No matter what the answer, this was clearly a matter of grave concern to the decision-makers of U.S. defense and intelligence policy. With that in mind, we can assume that the public statements, repeated over and over (flying saucers exist only in the imagination, nothing to them, all hoaxes or misidentifications, etc.) were intentional acts of deception. You can defend this lying if you choose. Maybe the government was trying to prevent mass panic, or hide their knowledge of this from the Soviets. But before you draw that conclusion, let us continue. And while we continue, I suggest you try to retain the image in your mind of an enormous reality that has continuously been denied by America's responsible leaders. Like a big sleeping bear in the corner of your dining room that no one is allowed to acknowledge. Just sit quietly and eat your dinner. Documents not whole story FOIA documents, important though they are, are not the whole story. Un- fortunately, researchers in this field have the odds stacked against them. We've obtained some documents to review, it is true. But in reality, this is clearly a sprinkling-the spray of the ocean. The ocean itself remains roped off. So we must be resourceful. We must be journalists as well as historians. We seek out people who have something to say on this matter. We judge their credentials. We check their facts. We continue trying to piece this story to- gether. The process is not infallible, we all know this. But it is necessary, and we must rely on our best judgement and sense of caution throughout. And thus we come to the strong rea- MUFON UFO Journal About the Author Richard Dolan is the author of UFOs and the National Security State (2000), which covers the pe- riod from 1941 to 1973. He is cur- rently completing the second vol- ume, 1974 to the present. Dolan did undergraduate work at Alfred University in history, En- glish, and philosophy, earned a scholarship to Oxford, and did graduate work at the University of Rochester in political science. He has spoken at several UFO conferences, including MUFON's 2002 and 2005 symposiums, and has written for the Journal and other UFO publications. son to believe that UFOs are more than just objects flying around in the sky, but are in fact retrieved technology that is being stored and studied, and perhaps duplicated, at secret bases. We also come to the likelihood that there are bodies-alien bodies-that have been studied by human scientists. We come to this amazing conclusion because more than fifty years of his- tory point inexorably toward it. There is Roswell, of course. Because the Roswell case has been so rich, so full of witness testimony, so portentous for its implications, debunking it has been a priority since the case arose. Roswell will not go away, despite ABC's recent best effort to do so. But, frankly, Roswell is not of critical im- portance to establish the likelihood of UFO crash retrievals by the U.S. mili- tary. UFOs were recovered many times by U.S. military personnel. UFO recoveries Kingman, AZ, in 1953, Las Vegas in 1962, and Kecksburg, PA, in 1965 are only among some of the better known cases in which U.S. military teams recovered what appear to have been genuine UFOs. There appear to be others. Once again, a remarkable statement September 2005"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"by Canadian government official and scientist Wilbert Smith sheds light on this matter. Not long before his death in the early 1960s, Smith said that during the great UFO wave of 1952, the U.S. military had shot off a piece of a flying saucer near Washington, D.C. He said that the U.S. Air Force had loaned him a small piece for \"a very short time.\" He showed it to his friend. U.S. Navy Rear Admiral H. B. Knowles. When asked if he returned the piece to the Air Force, he replied. \"Not the Air Force. Much higher than that.\" Was it the CIA? Smith chuckled and said. \"I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I don't care to go beyond that point. I can say to you that it went into the hands of a highly classified group. You will have to solve that problem, their identity, for yourselves.\" Claims and statements have been around for years regarding the storage of alien bodies at secure facilities, most notably Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH. During the late 1970s, UFO re- searcher and World War Two veteran Leonard Stringfield began to look closely into what he began calling \"the crash retrieval syndrome.\" People con- tacted him anonymously, he followed leads and uncovered other individuals. By the early 1980s, he had spoken to 20 first-hand military informants who had either worked on a UFO crash re- trieval or seen alien bodies in storage, and another 30 or so who were inter- mediaries. By all accounts, Stringfield was a gentleman and a careful researcher. He honored his promise to protect the iden- tities of the people who came to him, and never jumped to conclusions about what they told him. He also considered the possibility that he was being \"played.\" Still, Stringfield ultimately believed that the sources were too disparate, and did not appear to be coordinated. They ap- peared to be genuine, and the informa- tion legitimate. Collectively, they told a story of sev- eral crash retrievals of alien vehicles by U.S. military personnel, as well as the housing of bodies and study of tech- nology at deeply classified levels. Len Stringfield Stringfield's research into this mat- ter preceded the resurgence of the Roswell case. Indeed, we can trace ru- mors of crashed discs and alien bodies within the military to at least as early as 1949. There is an FBI document from March 22,1950, addressed to J. Edgar Hoover, that is so suggestive that one wonders if researchers even know what to do with it. But the document-another gift from FOIA-appears to be authen- tic. It states: \"An investigator for the air forces stated that three so-called flying sau- cers had been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers, approximately fifty feet in diameter. Each one was occupied by three bod- ies of human shape but only three feet tall, dressed in metallic cloth of very fine texture...\" Many UFO researchers who stay in this field long enough develop their own contacts with the classified world. I have, and I have only been publicly in- volved in this field for five years. For some of the people who have confided in me, I have not been able to confirm their identities fully; for others there is no question that they are who they say they are. A few of these people are quite prominent. They have told me the same thing Stringfield's contacts told him: there are deep black programs to study alien technology and bodies. But there is one person, very promi- nent indeed, who has been talking about this publicly for some years. He is Dr. Edgar Mitchell of Apollo 14 fame, and the sixth man to walk on the moon. On several occasions, Mitchell has spoken in public about his knowledge of such programs-knowledge that came to him. he said, through more than one elite-level connection. The manner in which the mainstream media has handled his statements would be an embarrassment if one didn't sense an ulterior motive behind such treatment, namely to defuse his statements as much as possible. The secrecy on this matter is unbe- lievable. It appears to be part and par- cel of an apparatus that is absolutely mammoth, and which does not exist officially. Dr. Richard Sauder has documented the existence of an enormous system of underground bases and even tunnels that stretches throughout the United States. Some of his research has un- covered a massive \"shadow\" govern- ment, so important and powerful that it appears to have authority over the \"real\" government. It would seem to me a logical guess that this system is related at least in part to the study of such bodies and tech- nology. [10] Along these lines, I have a friend who is a military attache living in Washingr ton, D.C. Some time ago, this person told me of some quiet discussions he has had with his own colleagues. One friend of his was a senior Congressional aide with significant budgetary review responsibilities. After a long period of number crunching, this aide came to the con- clusion that there existed an enormous black arm of the U.S. government. That is, a substantial, powerful, expensive, and secret executive branch of the U.S. government. This individual believed it was connected to UFOs. I was un- able to get further information about this person. What it looks like Even this is only a partial picture, but the story looks clear enough. Cutting September 2005 MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"with Occam's razor, the simplest ex- planation as I see it is something like this: During and immediately after World War Two, U.S. military personnel be- gan encountering exotic, unconven- tional, and extraordinary craft. It quickly became apparent to the best and brightest minds that these did not origi- nate with the Soviets, nor with the Americans. They almost certainly concluded that the \"true UFOs\" did not originate from our civilization. Hardly willing to share this information with others, secrecy became the rule. At some point very early on, alien technology and bodies were recovered. It would be of paramount importance to determine several things as quickly as possible: the intentions of these \"oth- ers,\" how to exploit their technology, and how to keep information away from undesirable groups, which would be just about everybody. More considerations than panic The reason for secrecy would be much more than preventing mass panic or some other form of public protec- tion. That sounds noble, and it may have been a factor early on in determining policy. But secrecy grows its own ten- tacles, and develops its reasons for self- preservation. I think that by the 1950s, at the latest, the office of the Presidency lost control over UFO secrecy. Imagine being one of the members charged with managing the UFO prob- lem. You have to keep it so secret that you almost have to hide it from your- self. Layer upon layer of deception fol- lows, false cover story upon false cover story. We can assume that the technology itself would have been amazingly ad- vanced, perhaps hopelessly so com- pared with what we had circa 1950. But perhaps, after a number of years, one clever scientist hit upon an idea based on one aspect of the recovered technology. Not only an incalculable technology advantage, but a nice ground floor investment opportunity. Over the years, much of the UFO information would have gone to private channels. This has been happening with all aspects of the military, why not 8 UFOs? It's especially useful in main- taining secrecy. Unlike a federal office, contractors such as Lockheed, Wackenhut, Kodak, General Motors, or any number of lesser known corporations are not sub- ject to the Freedom of Information Act laws. A senior military or intelligence ex- ecutive could hand off any number of sensitive papers to a trusted colleague in the private sector, knowing full well that the \"working group\" would main- tain access to all material anyway. The value of this technology is po- tentially-and certainly in reality-im- mense. I spoke to one man, not anony- mous but a real person with real black- world credentials, who said to me, \"You know what they're guarding out at Area 51? They're guarding money! An enor- mous amount of money!\" Money, he said, in the form of im- mensely valuable alien technology. Something else seems to have oc- curred along the way. According to a former head of Lockheed Skunkworks, the late Ben Rich, direct control over the UFO problem was removed from the U.S. Presidency around 1969. Since that time it has been controlled by private, international, channels. This is impossible to confirm at the present time. But it would be consistent with the ascendancy of international corpo- rations and elites over most other as- pects of global power. What it looks like is that UFO se- crecy has led to the establishment of a secret network which controls access to ET technology. While the network is international, it uses the substantial re- sources of the U.S. black budget and other secret military groups as a pri- mary tool to engineer exotic technolo- gies that enable it to maintain scientific, military, and economic superiority. Yes, that's what it looks like. We need to re-examine the major events of our history and try to under- stand them in light of this. UFO reality makes our actual history vastly differ- ent from what we are taught in the stan- dard books. With the existence of a secret and extremely powerful group controlling this subject and all that concerns it, a massive disinformation network has MUFON UFO Journal become necessary. Who knows how far the disinformation has gone? This is in itself a critical part of the reason UFO secrecy has helped to kill off the American Republic. Such lev- els of deception go beyond mere se- crecy, and make it necessary to toss out the old system in all but name. Recall my references in the first part of this article to important non- ufological threats to human freedom. What is now apparent is that UFO se- crecy has changed our system of gov- ernment so much over the years that various \"corrections\" have had to take place so that the externals can to some extent conform with the profound changes at the deeper levels. This has resulted in what I am cur- rently calling invisible fascism. Invis- ible because the official powers are not acknowledging it as such, but it is there all the same. One wonders what the next \"correction\" could bring. Next month: Part Three, A mat- ter of practical interest. Rocket blasts off for detailed study of Mars A 188-foot Atlas 5 booster, built by Lockheed Martin, blasted off at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Aug. 13, sending a sophisticated orbiter to Mars. The spacecraft's primary goal is to continue the search for evidence show- ing how long Mars had water. When the satellite arrives at Mars it will join two other U.S. orbiters, Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey, Europe's Mars Express spacecraft and the twin robot rovers, Spirit and Op- portunity. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is equipped with three high-resolution cameras and a radar sounder that can detect water and ice below Mars' sur- face. The most trying moment will come in March when the orbiter must slow down and allow itself to be captured by Mars' gravity. It is to spend four years in orbit around Mars looking for spots to land future rovers, leading to eventual hu- man expeditions. Other instruments will be able to map surface minerals and monitor Mars' atmosphere.

Discussed were MUFON's mission and goals, the MUFON Case Manage- ment System, the Pandora Project, MUFON finances, and input from State Directors. It was noted that 2,520 MUFON UFO cases, totaling 28,000 pages, have been entered into the Pandora Project thus far. With 12 boxes completed, the Project still has 20 boxes to go. When completed, it is anticipated that this will be one of the largest re- sources in the world for researchers. Also on Friday was the MUFON Business Board meeting; the reception for benefactors; and the reception, din- ner, and a panel discussion featuring Richard Dolan, John Schuessler, and Stan Friedman, hosted by Ken Storch. Presentations began early Saturday morning, with Tracy Austin-Peters as emcee. Tracy was also the luncheon speaker on Satur- day. Detailed papers by each speaker on each topic are included in the 2005 MUFON Symposium Pro- ceedings, avail- able from MUFON. The Austin-Peters Proceedings also includes a short piece by Dr. Edgar Mitchell, as well as a re- search paper on animal behaviors and UFOs by Joan Woodward. Scott Ramsey—The Aztec UFO Crash Ramsey discussed his efforts over the past 18 years to follow up on the 1948 crash at Aztec, NM, involving bodies and a recovered craft, which was first reported by writer Frank Skully in 1950. Ramsey Ramsey's ac- count of his re- search was fea- tured in the Au- gust, 2004, is- sue of the MUFON UFO Journal. He and wife Suzanne have discovered key witnesses, radar sites, physical evidence, and other information which strongly suggest that Skully's story is true. Phyllis Budinger—Search for Physical Evidence of Abductions Budinger, a chemical ana- lyst, discussed two of several ufological re- search projects that she has been involved with since retir- ing from private work and set- ting up Frontier Analysis, Ltd. The first part of her talk dealt the analysis of the dress Betty Hill wore during her famous ab- duction, while the second part ex- plained tests done on soil recovered from one of Stan Romanek's apparent abductions. The analysis of swatchs from Betty's dress was covered in both the January, 2004, Journal and the August, 2005, Journal. Basically the tests indicated that the substances found on Betty's dress were from external sources that could not be positively identified. The Stan Romanek case continues to yield extraordinarily interesting evi- dence which thus far is standing up well to scientific testing, and which involves many separate episodes. Budinger A summary of information released on the case up to that point was pre- sented in the April, 2004, Journal, and an initial look at the case was high- lighted in the October, 2002, Journal. The soil sample in question comes from a Nov. 17,2002, episode in which Romanek found himself locked out of his Nebraska house in the middle of the night, wearing only his underclothing. Reportedly dazed and disoriented, he was clutching a handful of dirt. In view of several prior episodes, Romanek felt he should preserve the dirt in case it would be helpful to those investigating his encounters. Budinger's analysis of the dirt indi- cated that the major portion of the het- erogeneous mixture was made up of dark gray particulates which are mostly beta bismuth trioxide. Also present was a small amount of bismuth, moderate amounts of light gray particulates which are mostly vit- reous (i.e. glass-like) silica, and trace amounts of other particulates which are most likely contaminants composed of natural oil, pet hair, plastic fragments, dirt, and plant-derived materials. Budinger notes that \"consultation with material scientists reveals that the material is definitely not a naturally oc- curring material. It is synthetic.\" She explains, \"Both dark and light gray particulates have been exposed to high temperature. For the silica to be glass-like, it had to have experienced high heat in formation. Also, I have been told that beta bismuth trioxide re- quires high heat in its formation.\" She concludes, \"This is an uncom- mon material for Stan to have in his hand. It is highly improbable that he picked it up in the backyard of his house. No matter what the composi- tion represents, it indicates he was else- where that night.\" Esen Sekerkarar—Best UFO Sightings in Turkey Ms. Sekerkarar is MUFON Repre- September 2005 MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Sekerkarar sentative for Tur- key, and has con- tributed several articles to the Journal, the lat- est in the April, 2005, issue.

His presenta- tion was so well received at the Symposium that he was noisily encouraged to extend his speak- ing time-and Dolan was the Dr. Leir Friedman only speaker to receive a stand- ing ovation. Dolan Stanton T. Friedman- Government UFO Lies Friedman, of course, is a regular col- umnist for the Journal, and has dis- cussed in his col- umns the prob- lems related to government se- crecy and lying. In his presen- tation he noted specific incidents going back sev- eral decades in which some arm of the govern- ment lied about UFO cases or UFOs in general. He notes that agencies such as the FBI, CIA, NS A, Air Force, and others have told documented lies-such as about Roswell and Project Blue Book- and that \"the press and certain other academic and supposedly scientific groups, such as SETI, have often blindly accepted and promulgated non- sense without any effort to get at the truth.\" Dr. Claude Swanson—The Rediscovery of Magic Dr. Swanson, who was educated as a physicist at MIT and Princeton Uni- versity, has been investigating the unified field theory, which has been called the theory of ev- erything,\" and which could ex- plain the uni- verse at the deepest levels. Dr. Swanson He pointed out in his talk that some phenomena reported in UFO or contact experi- ences, such as levitation by a craft or its occupants, out-of-body experiences, and psychokinesis (PK) would seem to be unexplainable-or magic-but that some of these phenomena have now been replicated in scientific laborato- ries. Likewise he suggested that some archaeological megalithic monuments, such as the Giza Pyramid, the Baalbek temple in Lebanon, and Stonehenge, may be evidence of a technology which once existed on Earth, but is now lost. \"In fact,\" he said, \"it may be our leg- ends of magic, which descend from the time of the Druids and Egyptians and the Old Testament, which may be the closest thing to a historical memory of those cultures.\" He adds, \"This suspicion is rein- forced when we study some of the tra- ditional and ancient cultures which sur- vive today. Researchers are startled to discover mat the Australian aborigines routinely use psychic ability to commu- nicate and coordinate with other mem- bers of their tribe, when separated by many miles.\" Dr. Swanson noted that the yogis of India possess written records and on- going traditions going back more than 6,000 years. \"Their world is much larger than ours,\" says Dr. Swanson, \"and includes many higher dimensions as well as par- allel universes. The puzzling abilities of ETs to teleport and levitate are not mysterious to them, for they are re- ported to possess these same abilities.\" He notes, \"There are many parallels between the phenomena observed in UFO/ET cases and the phenomena studied by paranormal investigators and parapsycholgists.\" Dr. Swanson says this includes levi- tation, out-of-body experiences, orbs, and \"the tunnel.\" These topics and more are detailed in his book. The Synchro- nized Universe-New Science of the Paranormal. In looking at ET, he concludes that \"there are clearly many different groups of ETs visiting the Earth, and many pos- sible levels of development as well as world views,\" but he believes that if they were here to conquer us, they would have done it years ago. \"Certainly they have observed us and conducted experiments upon us.\" he adds. \"However, many abductees also describe a form of education and train- ing over many years. It often involves developing a deeper understanding of the astral energies, greater psychic abil- ity, and in many cases an understand- ing of a world view quite different from ours, but quite compatible with the world view suggested by paranormal studies.\" 10 MUFON UFO Journal September 2005"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Dr. Leo Sprinkle—The ET Presence: Cons and Pros Dr. Sprinkle, professor emeritus of Counseling Services at the University of Wyoming, has been associ- ated with ufology for many years.

By Tom Deuley About six months ago LesLee Alexander, later my partner in the Si- lent Auction operation, showed me a small green rubber alien in a box. It was a game named Alien Autopsy. Well, anyway we played with it, had some fun and laughed a lot, then LesLee bet me that the game could be auctioned off at the MUFON sympo- sium for a fairly good price, suggest- ing some twenty dollars or so. We laughed at that too, and I told her that MUFON had considered a silent auction some years back, and had even asked Stanton Friedman if he would be willing to be auctioned off for a lunch date with a lucky bidder. He agreed, but it just never jelled. This idea of a Silent Auction kept coming up as the Alien Autopsy game floated around from one catch-all to the next.

We closed that list out with 21 items, thinking 30 or so items would be plenty for this first experiment. Many letters and E-mails went out looking for items and setting up the idea with Colorado MUFON, the 2005 Symposium sponsor, and our Interna- tional Director, John Schuessler. John agreed with great enthusiasm and eventually donated 75 items from his collection of UFO and space-related memorabilia. Colorado MUFON also came through like champions and arranged for us to set up tables at the back of the main speakers room. We had a great response and heard from nearly everyone we contacted. In the end we had lined up more than 100 items to deal with, most of which were not cataloged when we arrived in Den- ver-and which kept us up until two in the morning (Friday night) cataloging and displaying. But as the Friday night reception progressed, the bids quickly started go- ing up on items already displayed. The bidding was open all day Satur- day and until the noon lunch break on Sunday when we announced the win- ner of lunch with Stanton Friedman. Stan proved to be the great fundraiser we expected, as the top bid for an \"on your own\" lunch with him was $250. Though we only anticipated raising about $ 1,000, the bids had gone flying, and we collected just over $3,300 for the MUFON General Fund. Though we can't call it breaking the bank, we had a wonderful time sharing in the excite- ment that people were having watch- ing their bids. There were many items that excited people, and several good deals. One of the best was the Loren Gross UFO Papers collection, which went for $350. In terms of the items bid up the most, it had to be the UFO crystal paper- weight at $75 or the sculptured alien head $135, donated by the Roswell UFO Museum. The Alien Autopsy game? It went for $43.

Hair of the Alien-DNA and Other Forensic Evidence of Alien Abduc- tion by Bill Chalker, Paraview Pocket Books, www.SimonSays.com, 5x8, softcover, 342 pages, $14.00. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Journal Editor This is a very important book by a respected Australian ufologist who, for the first time, docu- ments DNA testing in what appears to be an abduction case. Readers of the Journal are familiar with the general outlines of the Peter Khoury case, thanks to articles by Chalker in the July 2001 and July, 2005, issues. Basically, this 1992 case involves Khoury waking up in his Sydney, Aus- tralia, home and finding two naked women on his bed, one blonde and one with dark hair who appeared to be Asian. Both appeared to be human-- like, but not really human. The blonde moved to Khoury and drew him to her breast, and Khoury tried to push her away, but discovered that she was stronger than he was. Finding it difficult to breathe, he bit off a piece of her nipple, which caused the blonde to release him. However, he had swallowed the bit- ten off piece, and was getting choked on it, coughing violently. Initially re- covering from the coughing, he looked up and the two entities were gone. Khoury went to the kitchen to get some bread to swallow to force the object the rest of the way down. He also drank a quantity of water. He then went to the bathroom, but found it painful to urinate, discovering two blondish, whitish hairs wrapped deeply around his penis. He carefully removed these and, because of previ- ous encounters, decided to save them in a zip-lock plastic bag. There they remained until Chalker became aware of them in 1996, but it was not until 1998 that Chalker was able to set up the first DNA tests. Two distinct phases of DNA analy- ses were done. Phase one testing, discussed in the 2001 Journal article, showed a rare Asian Mongoloid DNA in the shaft of the blonde hair sample, which, if re- lated to the blonde which Khoury en- countered, would be expected to yield a Caucasian profile. Hair dying and albinism were ruled out as possible explanations for the color of the hair. This individual was biologically close to normal human genetics, but of one of the rarest human lineages known-one that lies farther from the human mainstram than any other ex- cept for African pygmies and aboriginals. This led Chalker to investigate the possible Chinese connection, including well preserved mummies from the shifting sands of the Taklimakan desert-which had also been DNA tested. Phase two testing involving mito- chondrial DNA was done of the blonde hair, and the shaft again showed the same rare Chinese DNA, but testing of the soft root tissue showed a novel Basque/Gaelic type of DNA. This was a shocker to the scientists conducting the tests. Normally, the DNA should be consistent, regardless of which part of the hair was being tested. This anomaly suggests the pos- sibility of cloning. Nearly as shocking was the discov- ery that the hair sample seemed to show a viral resistance-an immunity to HIV- AIDS and possibly other viruses. Less than 1 percent of the population has this immunity, primarily people of northeast European or Jewish descent, and this immunity apparently goes back only 5,000 years in humans.

Box 16476, San Diego, CA 92176, 800- 700-8733, soft cover, 6x9,150 pages, $14.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Although the title of the book sug- gests it is about the crash of a UFO, practically all of it is actually about the sighting, possible capture, and medical examina- tion of creatures in the Varginha, Brazil, area in 1996. In fact, al- though a man and his wife report- edly saw an ap- parently damaged object flying low and seemingly com- ing toward the ground, neither of these individuals saw a crash-nor has there been wreckage located. Dr. Leir did not interview this couple. The author includes an excerpt from an article by Bob Pratt and Cynthia Luce which appeared in the Septem- ber, 1998, MUFON UFO Journal which tells of another potential witness to a crash, including a description of the crash area itself. But the credibility of this witness has been questioned, especially when he initially reported that it had occurred on Jan. 13, then later changed the date to Jan. 20, the day when the creatures were first spotted by three witnesses. Thus no new material regarding a crash is included in the six-page \"crash\" chapter of the book. The crash, if there was one, could of course be directly re- lated to the famous sightings of the strange creatures. By implication, then, the creatures sighted could be consid- ered extraterrestrial. Despite the misleading title-perhaps traceable to the publisher-and the lack of material on a crash, this is still an interesting and important book. Dr. Leir conducted his investigation of the Varginha case during a visit to the area in 2002 with the intention of locating physical evidence, and his de- tailed description of this journey makes up the bulk of the book. As he does not speak Portuguese, he had to rely upon translators for the in- terviews he conducted. His primary contact and escort was Ubirajara \"Bira\" Rodrigues, an attor- ney and respected Brazilian ufologist. Rodrigues has been one of the princi- pal Brazilian investigators of the Varginha case, along with Victorio Pacaccini and A. J. Gevaerd, MUFON director for Brazil. Rodrigues' son Rudolfo served as translator between Dr. Leir and the Brazilians. Through Rodrigues, Dr. Leir inter- viewed two of the three young ladies who had initially reported seeing one of the creatures. The whereabouts of the third young lady was unknown. Also interviewed was the mother of these two witnesses. These girls, Liliane and Valquiria, have been inter- viewed many times, including by Dr. John Mack, so Dr. Leir says he tried to find new questions for them. One interesting element was the statement by Liliane that, though ini- tially terrified, she had looked into the creature's eyes, felt sorry for it, and \"I just know it was intelligent.\" Apparently brought out for the first time by Dr. Leir was the mother's state- ment that at age eight or nine she had encountered a small figure on a nearby hill wearing strange clothing, including a hood over its head, and later in life periodically \"saw these same figures many times.\" When asked about dreams, the mother said, \"I never told anybody about this, but just after what happened to my daughters I had a dream that my daughters and I were sucked up out of the roof of our house into an airplane. I was terrified and don't remember much else about it.\" When asked by Dr. Leir about see- ing any strange marks on her body, she said she had not seen any. She did claim that lights and the TV seem to be af- fected by her presence at times. Dr. Leir, who is of course best known for his studies of implants, was attempting to determine if the daughters or the mother exhibited characteristics asso- ciated with abductions. It is difficult to determine at this point whether the witnesses have been con- taminated by the passage of time, the publicity, and numerous interviews. An interview was also conducted with the previously unavailable wife of a policeman, Marco Eli Cherese, 23, who may have died from contact with one of the creatures (see March, 2005, MUFON UFO Journal for other de- tails). She offered little new evidence, in- dicating that she did not remember much about his illness or the work he was doing as a member of the military, but did confirm that she was unable to get his medical records, talk to his doc- tors, get a copy of the death certificate, or even attend his funeral. An even more interesting interview was conducted by Dr. Leir at Humanitas Hospital, where one of the creatures had reportedly been taken, and where witnesses reported a coffin had been loaded onto an army vehicle. Rodrigues had set up the interview of three individuals, supposedly doc- tors, who reportedly had been told that they and their families would be in dan- ger if they talked about the creature. Dr. Leir had to promise that their testimony would not be publicized in Brazil, and that their names would not be used. This was apparently the first time that Rodrigues had heard this testimony as well. The doctors stated that what they were going to reveal had nothing to do with them personally, but was based on things they had heard. In quoting the individuals, Dr. Leir presents the testi- mony of the three as being from one September 2005 MUFON UFO Journal 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"person, although the statements appear to be direct quotes. This is somewhat confusing, espe- cially when this \"individual\" states that his specialty is orthopedic surgery. Were all three in the same specialty? These individuals stated that mili- tary personnel took over the surgery area, and that there was mass confu- sion. \"I was asked to begin a surgical scrub and to prepare for a fracture re- duction,\" said the three (or was it one of the three?). The individual(s) described being shocked at the sight of his patient, which matched the description given by the other witnesses to the creature sightings. The injury, \"a compound fracture of the femur\" in the upper thigh, was repaired as the patient re- mained awake. At times a heartbeat and pulse could be determined, but at times it could not. A local anesthesia was given. Blood around the injury was described as \"dark red,\" very similar to human blood, except for a higher platelet count. The bone of the creature was de- scribed as similar to human bone, \"with the exception that it was pinker in color and contained numerous lacunae or holes, giving it the appearance of os- teoporotic human bone.. ..It was much stronger than human bone... .Once the bone ends were approximated, the frac- ture defect seemed to stabilize and could not be moved apart.\" The doctors reported that when the surgery had been completed, the room filled with a greenish mist which seemed to be coming from the creature. \"In deep fear,\" said the doctor(s), \"I walked slowly closer to it and ap- proached the head of the table. With- out consciously realizing it, my gaze caught the eyes of the being. His eyes were glowing red, and appeared as two swirling pools of liquid. They were pulling, pulling me in, deeper and deeper. \"All at once giant portions of infor- mation came pounding into my head. These were like thought grams, large blocks of information. Over and over and over, like someone hitting me in the head with a hammer. I was also be- coming dizzy and slightly nauseated.\" Asked what the information was 14 MUFON International Director John Schuessler is presented a plaque by Tom Deuley at the 2005 MUFON symposium in recognition of Schuessler's 40 years in ufology. about, the doctor(s) replied, \"All that I am willing to tell you at this time is what the creature told me about human beings....Essentially, he told me his race felt very sorry for the human be- ings for basically two reasons. \"The first is that all humans have the same potential and abilities to perform the very same things his race could do. Those things we find so marvelous and magical, but humans do not know how to do them.... \"The second reason they felt sorry for us was we did not seem to realize we were spiritual beings only living in a temporary shell, and we were totally disconnected from our spiritual self.\" The doctor(s) said the creature was healing and in satisfactory condition when the military took it from the hos- pital, and that the military took all of the medical records. Stanton Friedman discusses the similarities and differences between Varginha and Roswell as Chapter 13 of the book, after Dr. Leir had done the same thing in Chapter 12. These dis- cussions add little to either case. Also utilized as \"fill\" is Chapter 2, \"The Great Brazilian Hoax,\" which is a discussion of the infamous Urandir Fernandes de Oliveira case involving a supposed abduction with burn marks left on bed clothing and a ceiling (see the August, 2003, MUFON UFO Jour- nal). In spite of the apparent need for fill material, there is no index in the book, no maps, and few illustrations. Although there is little that is new in MUFON UFO Journal this book, other than the medical testi- mony, Dr. Leir makes his journey to Brazil quite interesting. And, very im- portant, this is an honest report that highlights the evidence, as Dr. Leir found it, in an exceptional case. While the honesty of all participants in the Varginha case cannot be guaran- teed, Dr. Leir is a credible investigator who does not falsify or misrepresent what he finds, but goes out of his way to question and analyze the evidence.

After I saw the smoke from the wing of the Stealth, I couldn't spot the disc. \"There were a couple of witnesses leaving for the race. The female looked at the disc or bell and said, 'Cool.'\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Possible new Roswell info Dave writes: \"I wanted to relate a story to you about my father, Joe, who was on the civil engineering faculty at the University of Texas. \"In mid-July of 1947, my parents were driving late at night, westbound from Clovis, MM, trying to make Santa Fe. My Mother said that west of Clovis about 15 miles the road was open with no traffic. It was a clear starry night \"She said the road was 'mounded' up, built up higher than the surround- ing terrain. There was (and is) a rail- road track that parallels the road, but located down below, and that its tele- graph poles reached only slightly higher than the road surface. \"This stretch of road is about 40 miles northeast of Roswell, NM. To- day, as then, the road is still built up and, while there are more utility poles, there are still long sections where the road is about the height of the tops of the poles. \"If you are westbound, to the left is a long, descending plain that runs al- most to Roswell, devoid of trees, power line, and any other obstructions. As many places in the West, you can liter- ally see 25 to 30 miles. \"Suddenly Dad slammed on the brakes, a very hard setdown with smoke and boiling, screaming tires. As they sat there, in front of them about 150 feet, was a huge craft which had come up from the plains on the left, out of the darkness, and was skimming south to north across the road surface, 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"not touching the road, but about two feet above it. \"The wind draft of this object was pulling some dust and straw along with it. Mom said they could not see the top of the object until it passed, but that it filled the windshield view and rose out of sight vertically. \"She said that it looked like an ex- press passenger train, racing across a grade level crossing right in front of them. However, it was no train, it was huge with 'lighted' windows and some darkened windows, racing by, giving a passenger train effect of train windows going by. \"However, think of trains stacked on top of each other so high that it fills the windshield until out of sight. It was moving somewhat faster than any ex- press train she had ever seen, maybe 130 MPH, yet was so big it took some time to pass. \"Obviously, Dad had seen it coming at the last minute up out of the dark plains on the left. They both said that it had come 'from below' on the left to just skim the road top. Dad said it would have hit them had he not seen 'movement in the dark off to the left.' \"Both parents stressed that this 'was not a train,' no head lights. After it passed they looked for a track in the road, crossing signs, or any other evi- dence of rail. There was nothing. \"They did say the asphalt was hot, almost steaming, but there were no marks or anything. And definitely no railroad tracks. \"They also said it certainly wasn't a train, as it was huge-the size and height of the University of Texas Memorial Stadium. \"Both my parents were college edu- cated and intelligent. They both were religious and very skeptical of new things, of technology. So I am con- vinced that 'something' was seen there. It was after the Roswell incident by only days when my parents got 'buzzed.'\" Thanks to Dave. North Carolina UFO BELMONT - A Navy veteran and project manager with a mechanical en- gineering firm was driving home on Southpoint Road on May 28, 2005, at 11:15 PM, parallel to Lake Wylie, when 16 his wife observed an object flying in a strange manner. He reports, \"My wife snatched my arm and pointed to the object. I was in total awe, as the object was only a half mile from us and flying over Lake Wylie at 1,000 feet or less. \"We slowed down and were mov- ing at a snail's pace on the road to ob- serve this phenomenon. The object stopped, appeared to hover, and then performed a swift 90-degree turn and was heading in our direction towards the steam plant. \"The Charlotte International Airport is very close by, but we were nowhere close to its flight paths. We kept driv- ing, but the object turned west. We then turned our vehicle around and went back to the original spot where we had viewed the object. \"When we arrived, the object was back in its original position. The craft took a southerly course and flew over Gaither Road towards the other side of Lake Wylie. The craft made no sound and had a dull yellow glow on the bot- tom. The three lights were dull, also, but a tad brighter. \"When the craft pulled away, it kept at a very slow pace and was very close to us. The other witnesses were our kids (seven, five and two). The children observed this craft and were visibly/ emotionally disturbed by it. This was truly amazing!!\" Colorado sighting by Mackay DENVER - \"Greetings from Glennys Mackay, National Director MUFON Brisbane, Australia. I thought it is fitting to report a first-hand sight- ing on June 8, 2005, while visiting friends living up on Blue Mountain overlooking Golden, CO. \"At 7:15 PM, I was standing on the balcony admiring the view when we were attracted to what we thought at first to be a very large bird flying from west to east. \"I commented to my friend John Tracey (also visiting from Brisbane, Australia), 'What a huge bird.' When it passed the tall Ponderosa pines, it was in clear vision. \"This object was flashing a blue light, and on turning towards us was silver and round, and appeared to be MUFON UFO Journal landing on a clear grass area between the trees across the valley. It then climbed up to eye level and started to fly towards us. \"By this time there were three other people who witnessed this UFO: Averill Boylan from Tauranga, New Zealand; and our hosts, Ainsley and Darlene Bell. \"As we watched, it seemed to turn along the contour of the hills before changing direction and flying across the valley towards the rocky outcrop on our side of the valley before it took off at great speed towards Denver, then dis- appearing up into the clouds. \"We were able to take two photos as it began to gather speed. The report was given to John Schuessler at MUFON the following morning. \"I think, George, this really made our trip to the USA a pretty exciting one, as our host and hostess had never seen a UFO or believed up until this time.\" North Dakota saucer sighted TUTTLE - The observer reports, \"I am a 16-year-old girl, and my 17-year- old male friend and I were driving around our small town at 2 AM on May 28, 2005, when we saw a straight line of red lights. \"We were curious, so we followed the lights that were southwest of us. As we got closer we saw a circular object with red lights with little bars across them. At this point you could see it was very big. \"I lost it as it crossed the road, but my friend pointed to the other side of the road towards the east. So, we turned on the next gravel road towards the object and watched it go right over my friend's farm. \"It was hovering for at least a minute when there appeared a smaller saucer right below the big one. \"We followed it for at least five min- utes before it disappeared, and it seemed like it was running away from us.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. New York loss of satellite radio GLENS FALLS - The witness was listening to Sirius Satellite Radio when the signal started to break up for no apparent reason on May 28, 2005, at 5:55 PM.

The witness reports, \"Suddenly, there was no signal/sound. When I checked around, I jokingly stated to my family that the satellite must have ex- ploded, which prompted me to look up. \"To my surprise, I noticed a 'black dot' (craft) in the sky. The object never moved. On this day there were some passing clouds at different altitudes. Clouds would pass over the object and it would remain in view. \"A series of clouds passed below the object, and visual was lost. Moments later the radio began to regain the sig- nal of the satellite. When the clouds passed, the object was gone \"One witness was able to retrieve binoculars and make a visual, but all that could be established was that the object was reflecting the sunlight. The satellite radio was lost for about 10-15 minutes. Visual of craft was about 3-5 minutes.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Washington sighting by experts MT. ADAMS - One of the witnesses reports, \"There were four Boeing man- agers present on Saturday, June 4, 2005, to a UFO sighting. The four pro- fessional aerospace witnesses, includ- ing myself, know better than armchair naysayers what celestial objects are ob- served. \"I have seen dozens of missile launches, myriad aircraft under all con- ditions, and I am intimately familiar with the US radar, space, and missile technology and advanced capabilities. \"At 10:15 PM, I tried to power up my digital camera for the really awe- some one of the four UFOs I saw, but I was too late. We were looking towards the mountain until midnight. \"We were guests of James Gilliland at his ranch, 13 miles south of Mt. Adams, when we saw a star-sized white light crossing the sky directly above us heading south at a fairly fast clip, 'snaking' back and forth by sev- eral nearby stars. \"It moved across the sky for about 20 to 30 degrees of arc, and stopped, parked there, and dimmed. With the hundreds of stars visible and the fact that it stopped moving, I soon lost track September 2005 of the UFO's exact position. \"Our host had a telephoto lens, and saw a red light attached to its tail while it was moving. I spotted the UFO first, as I have exceptional long range vision. \"The second sighting was a brighter star-sized UFO which came into view moving west and traveling 10 to 15 de- grees of arc across the sky at about a 60-degree angle from the ground. \"It took a smooth 35-degree arcing turn to the NNW, traveled a short dis- tance, and stopped high above Mt Adams. No dimming. \"The third and best sighting was a medium bright, star-sized UFO which came in from the WSW and meandered somewhat randomly in an easterly di- rection. It stopped right next to a dim- mer star. \"Suddenly it lit up hundreds of times brighter than it was for four seconds, moved off into space, and dimmed to nothing in a snaking trajectory. When that puppy lit up, everyone gasped, cheered, hooted, hollered, and went wild. \"The fourth sighting was a star-sized UFO traveling south when it 'flashed' like a strobe pulse, then returned to a very dim object. A few seconds later, it flashed again, and dimmed. \"This scenario was repeated 12 times while crossing directly overhead and traveling 35 degrees of the sky, changing directions multiple times. The flashes were randomly timed. The UFO then stopped above us, and parked there for the rest of the night.\" Thanks to R.A. Illinois teardrop FRANKLIN PARK - The witness was in his yard having a smoke and saw a bright flash of light like a camera flash, but pinpoint in size, to the west at 11 PM on May 22, 2005. He says, \"My view was obstructed for about 15 seconds by trees, but it was heading towards me. As it ap- proached, I began to see color and shape. It passed directly overhead and continued east until I could no longer see it. \"It was glowing an orange-yellow color, and the lights on the bottom of it appeared to be segmented into three rectangular shapes, nearly the same in shape and size. There was a halo of light MUFON UFO Journal surrounding it that was more yellow in color and appeared misty. That is how the teardrop type shape was seen. \"The object was rotating counter- clockwise on what appeared to be an asymmetrical axis at one revolution every 3 or 4 seconds. The revolutions and lateral speed were constant. \"Though die defining lines of the ob- ject could not be seen clearly, I got a distinct view of the underside. I called my step-daughter out, but she only saw it briefly rotate in the distance.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Minnesota triangle FERGUS FALLS - Witnesses at dif- ferent locations apparently made obser- vations of the same flying triangle. Two witnesses in the town were ob- serving the Northern Lights in the dis- tance when they saw a bright orange triangle that appeared from the east at treetop level and moved slowly north, disappearing at 3 AM on May 20,2005. The object made no sound. The night was clear and still. The object would fit inside the full moon if the full moon was about half its normal size. Another witness in Fergus Falls in- dicated that the object was in the north- ern sky, from her vantage point. The second witness, who lived three blocks to the north of the first witnesses, indi- cates that she had seen the object to the south, from her vantage point at her home. If that second report is true, the ob- ject may have been located between the witnesses. Canada flashing saucer lights TORONTO - Agnes Sroczynski writes, \"On June 22,2005, at about 10 PM, in the Remington Park area of the city, my friend and I witnessed a disc- shaped metallic object from the elev- enth floor window of my friend's apart- ment. \"The object had large, white, spheri- cal lights on the sides, flashing quickly and erratically. It was close to the build- ing, and not far above us. Only one or two lights were visible at any one time. \"The object danced a dizzying pat- tern in the sky while it continued trav- eling west, extremely fast. This is a good spot for sightings in Toronto.\" 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"t /v k Or* . « j U Physical Trace§ By Ted Phillips Occupants and physical traces Last month I noted a number of physical traces cases, in which occu- pants were present. This month is part two. 09/10/54 2230 France, Quarouble: Animal reaction-area heated to high temperature-dark mass on railroad tracks less than 6 yards away-two 3 ft beings. The witness approached to within 6 ft when he was blinded and paralyzed by a brilliant light from the dark mass.. The be- ings returned to the object, and it ascended with a ~ , D . .... low whistling Ted Phillips sound, emitting a \"thick dark steam,\" becoming red lu- minous, and flying away. On the rail- road ties were 5 imprints. It was calcu- lated that a 30-ton weight would have been necessary to produce them. 09/24/54 France, Becar: Two women made independent reports of a dark gray disc, 21 feet in diameter, 4 feet high, seen resting on the ground in a clearing. A man of normal height was stand- ing near it. He wore dark clothes. One witness within 100 feet of the object stated that the man was repairing it. Traces were found in the grass. 09/26/54 1430 France, Chabeuil: Madame Leboeuf had gone to gather mushrooms in the woods not far from the cemetery at Chabeuil. Her dog be- gan to bark, and then began howling as if in misery. Madame Leboeuf looked around and saw that the dog was standing in front of something which she thought was a scarecrow. Upon approaching the dog, she saw it was some kind of a creature in a diving suit. 18 The creature was about 1 m tall. It moved toward her with a sort of quick, waddling walk. The witness ran into a nearby thicket. By this time the dog was howling again, accompanied by the howls of the other dogs in the village. A large, circular, and somewhat flat- tened metallic-appearing object as- cended from behind nearby trees and moved away at low altitude, making a whistling sound as it flew. At the place where the object had risen, a circular area was found. About 11 feet in diameter, the shrubs and bushes were crushed. For a few yards at the beginning of the wheat field, over which the object had flown, the wheat was flattened out in a radiating line. From one of the acacia trees at the edge of this circular imprint hung down a branch more than three inches thick, broken by pressure from above. The branch of another acacia, which hung over the circular mark eight and a half feet above the ground, was entirely stripped of its leaves. -Aime Michel. 09/27/54 2050 France, Premanon: The four Romand children heard their dog barking and saw, outside their barn, a \"tin ghost\" like a \"lump of sugar standing on end.\" One of the children threw rocks at it and attempted to touch it; he was thrown to the ground \"as if by an invis- ible force.\" The thing moved off to a large bright red luminous ball, oscillat- ing slightly 400 to 500 feet away in the meadow. They told their teacher, and police investigated, finding that the grass was flattened counter-clockwise over a 12 ft diameter area, sharply defined. Within the circle there were four im- prints-triangular holes, 4 inches in di- ameter, inclined at an angle of 45 de- grees toward the center, arranged in a square. Outside the circle, a flagpole was scratched and the bark was torn off at a height of 5 inches above the ground. At the foot of the pole were two marks MUFON UFO Journal similar to the other four, but more elon- gated. 10/04/54 0810 France, St. Pardoux: M Lacambre, a forester, re- ported seeing a small being 3 ft tall which rose into the air by virtue of 2 pear-shaped boxes beneath his arms. Footprints were found. 10/05/54 0715 France, Mertrud: Road mender Andre Narcy was mo- torcycling to work when he saw an or- ange object in a field-a 10m disc with a large dome He walked to within 100 yards and saw a 4 ft being who entered the object, which took off causing a con- siderable disturbance. At the spot the grass was found crushed within a 3m square, and had a milky color. Twelve parallel tracks, spherical in shape, were also found. . 10/07/54 France, Mendionde: Manes Cuesurtia saw two red objects, mushroom-shaped, in a field. They were 6 ft in diameter. Standing near the objects he saw two small beings 2.5 ft tall which soon en- tered one of the objects and flew away vertically without sound. Grass was crushed down in a circular pattern and yellowed. 10/08/54 2300 France, St. Cloud: Mr. Puygelier, 24, was driving when he saw an egg-shaped object landing behind a hedge a few yards from the road. He and another witness saw a being standing in the field. A strip of burnt grass 10 ft long was found at the landing area, and around the burnt strip the grass was pushed down. 10/09/54 2030 France, Briatexte: Jean Pierre Mitto was driving with two cousins when they saw two small be- ings the size of 11 or 12- year-old chil- dren crossing the road 25 ft ahead of the car. The witness stopped the car and they saw a red glowing disc ascend verti- cally from a field. The object was about 22 ft in diameter. A brown, oily resi- due was found at the site.

As they neared, they saw it was from the interior of an object like a fat shell which was 6 ft in diameter and 8 ft high on 3 legs. It was a whitish-metallic, with an opening on the side facing the road. Inside were thick cables and a 4 ft be- ing. The witnesses passed within 15 feet of the object. The car's headlights went out and came back on as they passed it. They found an 8-inch carbonized spot giving off an odor like benzene and surrounded by 3 imprints 4 inches deep on a circle of 4.5 ft in diameter. 11/01/54 Italy, Cennina: multiple witnesses, separate locations, 1 within 10 ft from cylinder on ground. Two occupants. Independent witnesses see both descent and ascent. Circular trace- imprints. This high strangeness event will be presented in more detail in a later col- umn dealing with the top 20 physical trace events in the database. 11/05/54 France, La Roche-Brenil: multiple witnesses observe an orange object landing. The witnesses moved to within 130 feet, of the device. The object was 30 ft in diameter, 16 ft high, with a 10 ft dome with ports. A humming sound could be heard. Humanoids were seen near the object. The grass was burnt, the soil blackened and covered with cinder-like material in a circle 3m in diameter. The witnesses found a part of a white ball, which was a cottony substance but heavy as lead, and a yellow powder which was also very heavy. Soon after collecting the material the witness noticed his fingers burning; the next day they were blistered and black- ened. The powder was analyzed and found to be mostly silver nitrate 08/21/55 2030 KY, Hopkinsville- multiple witnesses. Circular object lands near farm house, and numerous glowing occupants approach house. Witnesses shoot, occupants float to ground from roof and trees. Glowing puddle on ground seen by police. The case will be detailed in the twenty best trace cases in a later col- umn. September 2005 05/10/57 2250 France, Beaucourt: A 29-year-old railroad worker and four other witnesses saw a blinding light on the road and four humanoids. Object was 150 feet away, pulsat- ing dull red and white. Witnesses watched for 20 minutes. A 15 ft circle was found. 11/06/57 VA, Jonesville: Buford Seabolt was hunting when he saw a landed object and two small beings. His hunting dogs reacted. A concave de- pression 4 feet wide and 24 feet long was found. 09/29/591900 Sweden, Marianne- lund: The electrical power in the three witnesses' house failed; when they ran outside they saw a blinding white light which stopped and hovered. The ob- ject started to move, slowly descend- ing and turning to the right, hitting and smashing a portion of a maple tree (top section). It then descended towards the ground. One witness was 10 feet from it. Through a large window he could see two occupants, with large eyes; the heads were highcrowned. The occu- pants were small in size. The object was oval, about 12 feet long and 8 feet high. It was found that a gray-white substance covered power lines. The witness was Gideon Johansson, his wife and his son.

Metal Rubber takes a beating Terrible, horrible things can be done to this millimeters-thick patch of shim- mering material crafted by chemists at NanoSonic in Blacksburg, VA. Twist it, stretch it double, fry it to 200°C, douse it with jet fuel-the stuff survives. After the torment, it snaps like rubber back to its original shape, all the while conducting electricity like solid metal. The abused substance is called Metal Rubber, and, according to NanoSonic, its particular properties make it unique in the world of material chemistry. As a result, the company's small of- fice has been flooded with calls from Fortune 500 companies and govern- ment agencies eager to test Metal Rubber's use in everything from artifi- cial muscles to smart clothes to shape- shifting airplane wings. At this stage, however, NanoSonic is busy meeting the demand for its 12- inch-by-12-inch samples, which take custom-built robots up to three days to create. That's speedy, if you consider that Metal Rubber, a product of nanotechnology, must be fabricated molecule by molecule. The manufacturing process, called electrostatic self-assembly, starts with two buckets of water-based solutions- one filled with positively charged me- MUFON UFO Journal tallic ions, the other with oppositely charged elastic polymers. The robot dips a charged substrate (glass, for ex- ample) alternately from one bucket to the next. The dipping slowly builds up tight, organized layers of molecules, bonded firmly by opposing charges. Afterward the substrate is removed, leaving a free- standing sheet of Metal Rubber.

Friedman UFO Sites Whenever I am in Roswell, NM, such as in early July, 2005,1 am asked about the exact location of the Foster Ranch site where the debris field was found by rancher Mac Brazel. People ask about getting to the site, what its GPS coordinates are, and what is special about it. I have to tell them that, while I have been out there more than once. I discourage people from going. There are several reasons: The site is in the middle of nowhere, many miles from a road, on private land, without any services of any kind in case of trouble. There are rattlesnakes and scorpions. It is very hot in the summer with very high UV levels because of the altitude and clear skies. The fire danger is usu- ally very high. Incidentally, I don't know the GPS coordinates, and probably in most in- stances wouldn't have given them out even if I had. The land is fragile, as sev- eral landowners out there have told me, including the rancher at the Plains of San Augustin site. Four-wheel-drive and off-the-road vehicles can create ruts which can iso- late areas when thunderstorms come. I also stress that there are thousands of square miles identical in surface characteristics that are much closer to Roswell and very much easier to reach. I stress this to TV crews. I spent a total of seven hours in two sessions at one such site this last trip responding to questions from a Toronto TV crew working on a documentary for the Discovery Channel. We were miles away from a primary or even secondary road, so that we wouldn't be bothered by highway noises. I was seated in a comfortable chair, wearing a not so comfortable suit and tie, with the air temperature being 107. Fortunately, the humidity, according to the TV, was only 7%. One assistant kept offering me a bottle of water. Gorgeous view of a typi- cal desert landscape valley-not a tree to be seen. The film crew believed me when I told them that on a trip to the real site with several Japa- nese journal- ists, we didn't see another person or ve- hicle for 54 miles, almost an impossibil- ity in Japan. One benefit of being at the actual site, Stan Friedman aside from the obvious fact that in 1947 there were certainly no tourists anywhere near, was recognition of why, according to the Eisenhower Briefing Document, p.3, (see my TOP SECRET/MAJIC, 2 nd edi- tion, just published) the crew was found two miles east of the wreckage as a re- sult of aerial reconnaissance, but was apparently not observed by the rancher or Jesse Marcel and Sheridan Cavitt when they went out on Sunday, July 6, 1947. It is gently rolling country. From a point on the ground one could not have seen the crew compartment. On the other hand with aerial reconnaissance, which would certainly have been un- dertaken with one of the base's spotter planes, any metallic wreckage would have been immediately spotted from the air, because there are only low scrub bushes and lots of sand. Believe it or not, I have been shown Roswell city maps and been asked on what corner the crash occurred! I usu- ally say about 80 miles that-a-way. People sometimes tell me they were hoping to go to both the actual site and Area Slat the same time. Many seem to think Area 51 is very nearby, rather than more than 600 miles away in Ne- vada. It would have been very easy for military guards to protect the site while detailed analysis of the location of vari- ous pieces of wreckage and in-situ pic- tures could have been taken without anybody in the outside world knowing what was going on. I previously had noted on my website (www.stantonfriedman.com) about the Flatwoods, WV, UFO landing on Feb. 12, 1952. how important it was for me to be at the actual location of the tree from behind which the \"Monster\" came out, and to see, as investigator Frank Feschino Jr. and I walked up the hill behind the tree, the only flat clear area in the neighborhood. Any pilot, alien or domestic, would have chosen to put down a damaged aircraft on such a spot. I should stress that another advan- tage of going to the exact location of an event is that it makes it much easier to re-enact the sighting-the object moved from over that telephone pole to over that steeple in so many seconds. It was at this angle above the horizon. These are much better judged on location than in an office. Debunker Joe Nickel didn't go to the Flatwoods location and didn't talk to the main witnesses. So he foolishly con- cluded that what was seen was a 6' owl and a meteor landing!! There was no crater, no shock wave, no meteorites found. As a general rule, meteors don't move slowly and make a turn around a town before crashing either. Frank's book, on my website order blank, is The Braxton County Monster: Coverup of the Flatwoods Monster Revealed. Just before going to Roswell I had traveled to near Lincoln, NH, to see the actual location of the abduction of Betty 20 MUFON UFO Journal September 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"and Barney Hill in September, 1961, as described in John Fuller's book The Interrupted Journey and on the NBC- TV program \" The UFO Incident\" star- ring James Earl Jones and Estelle Par- sons. An English TV Company was do- ing a program about many \"unusual stories\" and wanted a 7-8 minute piece on the Hill case. They asked me if I knew any family member who might still be alive, and I put them in touch with Kathleen Marden, who handles getting MUFON people accredited as investigators. Kathy is Betty's niece, and was very close to her the last several years of her life. She has been both a teacher and a social worker. I had met Betty and Barney way back in November, 1968, a few months be- fore Barney's death, and had appeared with Betty on various TV shows, in- cluding the Tom Snyder \"Tomorrow\" show, as well as interviewing Betty at her home for my video \"UFOs ARE Real.\" I was also the first to publish an ar- ticle (SAGA Magazine) about Marjorie Fish's outstanding work on the star map drawn by Betty under a posthypnotic suggestion by psychiatrist/hypnotist Dr. Benjamin Simon. Betty, John Fuller, and I appeared on a TV show hosted by David Susskind as well. In addition I had instigated Terence Dickinson's outstanding article about the star map in ASTRONOMY. I flew down to Boston, rented a car and drove up to Lincoln. I met the crew which shot various scenes while driv- ing around the very heavily wooded area. In the afternoon we met with Kathy and viewed both the road locations from which Betty and Barney had observed the UFO, and then the very isolated location where they were abducted. It was a large very sandy clearing off an old logging road that is paved now, but was just a dirt road then. The road locations have been built up quite a bit, but the clearing is still very much iso- lated, though a house has been built right in the middle of it. Being at the location for the first time, I immediately realized, as should have been obvious, that the aliens had mentally directed Barney, who was driving the car, to the abduction loca- tion. From the air it was one of the few possibilities for both landing a good size vehicle from above and being close enough to a road for the abductees to drive in to be taken on board. They were mentally coerced to show up. It was far enough from civilization to be sure of not being interrupted dur- ing the alien's examination of the Hills. The family that lived in the house had not been aware that it had been the ab- duction site 44 years earlier. To me one of the most fascinating aspects of the whole abduction syn- drome has been that the aliens seem to be able to control our minds to get us to do what they want without putting a gun or knife to a specimen to get them to cooperate. I will admit that the notion of mind control from a distance is scary. I have no idea how it is done. I am also very intrigued by the many reports of people being taken through walls and windows by the alien abductors. I have no idea how to do that either. But my study of the development of technology indicates that technological progress almost always comes from doing things differently in an unpredict- able way. The future is not an extrapo- lation of the past. Surely all govern- ments would very much like to be able to duplicate these capabilities. Don't forget that the base stars for these aliens, as indicated by Marjorie Fish's exciting work, Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli, are about one billion years older than the sun One would expect some capabilities more advanced than ours. Admittedly, some people get upset with me when I suggest such \"paran- ormal\" capabilities. Physicists are sup- posed to stick to the \"real world.\" So what would Christopher Colum- bus have thought of the Queen Mary 2 or lasers, the space shuttle, DNA, or the internet?? Yesterday's paranormal is tomor- row's normal. We need to recognize our ignorance, rather than saying something is impossible.

Clifford Clift and Jack Sawatzki led a smooth running ven- dor operation, garnering nice comments from the attendees and the vendor op- erators as well. Judy Orsatti and Barry Roth did a super job with the advertising and public relations effort. Our thanks go to Virgil Staff for chairing the State Director's Meeting and to all the state directors who participated. We are hop- ing to double the number of state di- rectors at that meeting next year. Featured speaker Astronaut Edgar Mitchell became ill and was hospital- ized about a week before the sympo- sium and was unable to attend. It is our pleasure to announce that he is re- covering well from his operation and should be back to 100% active in the very near future. We missed Edgar at the event and wished him \"go for re- covery!\" The 2006 MUFON International UFO Symposium will be held in Den- ver at the Marriott Tech Center Hotel on July 14-16. The theme of the event will be \"The Best UFO Evidence.\" We hope you all will start planning today to attend the 2006 event. Best Evidence Contest As noted in the June, July and Au- gust issues of the MUFON UFO Jour- nal, MUFON is seeking papers on the subject of \"UFO Technological Evi- dence.\" Cash awards will be given to the winners, and some of the papers will be selected to run as articles in the Jour- nal and as special presentations at the 2006 MUFON International UFO Symposium. The deadline for submittals is Oct. 1,2005, with awards made in January, 2006. All submittals must be sent to MUFON, P.O. Box 369, Morrison, CO 80465-0369 and marked to \"MUFON Best Evidence Contest.\" Membership Drive Initiative Recognizing the need for the MUFON organization to have a strong, vibrant, and growing membership, Elaine Douglass, co-state director for Utah and a speaker at the 2005 MUFON symposium, came up with the idea of giving a bonus gift to all people signing up during the sympo- sium. She financed, prepared, and deliv- ered a beautifully packaged version of the Samuel M. Sherman audio tape pre- sentation of \"The Edwards Air Force Base Encounter.\" The recording is an actual de-classified Air Force record- ing of a jet fighter intercepting a UFO on Oct. 7, 1965, over Edwards Air Force Base in California. Everyone joining MUFON or re- newing their membership at the sym- posium received a free copy of the re- cording as a bonus for becoming a MUFON member. We thank Elaine for all of her work and creativity in making this bonus gift available as a part of our new member initiative. We plan to periodically re- peat this offer for new members on the MUFON website at www.mufon.com. Outstanding History Channel TV Program On Aug. 8,2005, the History Chan- nel presented a new UFO documentary entitled \"UFO Files-The UFO Hunt- ers.\" This is one of the first TV pro- grams dedicated to UFO facts without a hint of debunking. The audience reaction was fantasti- cally positive. MUFON headquarters was swamped with telephone calls, emails, and membership applications. Many of the watchers became MUFON members immediately. Hun- dreds more requested information about MUFON and the UFO subject. We have never ever seen such a pow- erful response to a UFO program as \"The UFO Hunters\" evoked. This is a testament to the TV documentary pro- ductions skills of John Greenewald, Jr., host of the Black Vault Chronicles and MUFON member. New Lifetime Members It is a pleasure to announce that Greg Parks of Lakewood, CO; Michelle Poolet of Golden, CO; Woodrow W. Richards, Jr. of Old Town, ME; and Judy Varns of Phoenix, AZ, are now MUFON Lifetime Members. In fact, this is the second time Judy has become a lifetime member. These talented people bring excel- lent skills to the organization, and we are extremely thankful for their vote of confidence and outstanding level of support. All lifetime members receive the specially designed MUFON Benefactor's jacket with the MUFON logo. Generous Grant from a Lifetime Member MUFON has received a grant to apply to our document conversion project from Bob and Zoh Hieronimus of 21 st Century Radio in Owings Mills, MD. In addition they gave radio interview time to me and several of the MUFON symposium speakers on the July 4 th weekend. Bob and Zoh are both MUFON Lifetime Members, and we appreciate their continued strong sup- port for MUFON initiatives. New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director of Field Investigator Training, has an- nounced that Alex Broskey of Leesville, SC; Frank Dominczak of Hilbert, WI; Raymond Dzik of Northridge, CA; Donald Helbig of Louisville, KY; David Marchant, Sr. of Savannah, GA; and Richard M.

J. McLeod October 2005 Moon Phases: New Moon: Oct. 3 (annular solar eclipse) First Quarter: Oct. 10 Full Moon: Oct. 17 (Hunter's Moon and partial lunar eclipse) Last Quarter: Oct. 25 Bright Planets (Evening Sky) Mercury: Moving from Virgo through Libra into Scorpius. For north- ern hemisphere observers Mercury will not be visible this month. For more favored southern hemi- sphere observers Mercury will emerge in the..west-southwest evening twilight in the first half of the month. By month's end Mercury will set nearly 2 hours after the Sun and will have risen com- pletely out of the evening twilight in the west-southwest. Venus: Moving from Libra through Scorpius into Ophiuchus. For northern hemisphere observers Venus will im- proye.in visibility as it will set nearly 2 hours after the Sun and will be observed low in the southwest during evening twilight. For more favored southern hemi- sphere observers Venus will set more than-3.5 hours after the Sun and will stand nearly 30 degrees high in the west-southwest at the end of evening twilight. -Jupiter: In Virgo. For northern hemisphere observers Jupiter will not be visible this month. For southern hemisphere observers Jupiter will only be, visible early in the month and very low in the-west after sunset. Bright Planets (Morning Sky) Mars: Moving from Taurus into Aries. Mars will reach its closest ap- proach to the Earth on Oct. 30. For northern hemisphere observers Mars will .rise during evening twilight in the east-northeast and will stand about 60 degrees high by 2 AM. At the beginning of morning twilight Mars will be standing about 45 degrees high in the west-southwest. 24 For southern hemisphere observers Mars will rise in the east-northeast about 2 hours after sunset and will stand about 30 degrees high in the northwest after the beginning of morning twilight. Saturn: In Cancer. For northern hemisphere observers Saturn will rise in the east-northeast before midnight and will stand about 50 degrees high in the east-southeast at the beginning of morning twilight. For southern hemisphere observers Saturn will rise near 2 AM in the east- northeast and will stand about 25 de- grees high in the northeast at the be- ginning of morning twilight. Other Celestial Phenomena Eclipses: Annular Solar Eclipse: Oct. 3. The eclipse will be visible from extreme eastern Newfoundland, south-eastern Greenland and Europe, most of Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. Partial Lunar Eclipse: Oct. 17. Part or all of the umbral phases will be vis- ible in central and western North America, parts of Central America, most of Asia and Australia. Zodiacal Light: Zodiacal light will be visible in northern latitudes in the East before the start of morning twilight from Oct. 2 to Oct. 16 and from Oct. 31 to Nov. 13. The phenomenon is visible only from very dark locations. Zodiacal light is sunlight bouncing off dust grains in our solar system. These grains lie mostly in the plane of the solar system. Look for a pyramid of light in the morning sky somewhat similar in ap- pearance to the light from a city or town just over the horizon. Meteor Showers: Orionids: This shower produces fast meteors (40 miles/sec). About 20% will leave trails. While the rate is stated to be 25/hour, it can vary between 10 and 70 per hour. The duration of this meteor shower extends from Oct. 15 to 29, with maxi- mum occurring on Oct. 21 The point MUFON UFO Journal from where the Orionid meteors appear to radiate is located within the constel- lation Orion and is referred to as the radiant. The radiant is located in the northeastern part of that constellation. The radiant rises around 10:30 PM local time. At about 3 AM the radiant is about 50 degrees above the horizon. To best observe the Orionids lie out- side in a reclining lawn chair. The two best ways to observe the Orionids is either by pointing your feet southward (the general direction of the radiant) and looking in the region straight up, or pointing your feet south-westward and have your center of gaze around 60° above the horizon. Do not look directly at the radiant, because meteors directly in front of you will not move much and fainter ones might be missed. Other minor meteor showers will be going on at the time, and stray meteors, more commonly called sporadics, will frequently be seen that do not belong to a meteor shower. When you see a meteor, mentally trace it backwards, and if you arrive at the region just northeast of the main body of Orion, it is probably an Orionid. Unfortunately the moon will be just past its full phase and will interfere with observation of the meteor shower. September 2005"}]
