They were .members of, the Croatizn Natural Science Society,, ~stronom~ Department, who meet together there every night, Tggy reported. to us that they had quddenly observed over Zagreb \"Fly- ing Seukers.. Shortly ai'terwerd our reporter, WPS able to record their authentic statements which were documented by excellent photographs of what they had seen. This was well-documented considering th~t this sub~ect, as of later, has been very much in. the limeljghf,\"in our country and abroad. It ,was around $:45 p.m, said Zoran. Farci~h, a senior at the high school at Tresnjevka. \"I stood at a window and all of a sudden I could .not believe my eyes. Southeast under the star Aldebara'n, in the constellation of Steer, I sighted three bright objects, that is; three-glowing dots which eminated bluish colors. It appeared that two objects were motionless, while the third moved in the distanke, lrnrned<ately, I ran to my photo laboratory, and asked my colleague to get a camera and take scme pho3ographs of 'this occurence, I hid a very difficult time Convincing him thpt this was not a joke,ll \"Really, I cou'ld not believe it at first,\" st~ted Damir Grcdish,' a student at the school for applied 'arts. I rcn toward the, window , and there I saw two bright and one darker-objects. We alwzys keep caneras ready and it did not! t~ke me long to get a camera wi3h a tripod and to take some pictures. I used AgCa film of 32 dl-ns zhd I exposed it for two minutes. All the while I could observe tl-~ h..-Sr;7.3 -, objects and follow them with my bin~culars.~~ At the spme time Zoran czlled uyon Darko 'Fejzagish, 2 mo:>L :r;lcu lgte youpg student at the Tresnjevka high school, to take-a sfi~dl~ 11Z_eis9f telescope and observe the bright ob,jects.L He said/ \"I kv62 2lso\"seen the three objects, but by the time I had set up the telez=c;3r. they had zlre~dy Fone. I really +onlt know whzt to meke out of th~ 3 appearance. They could not have 5een sate.llit,es, since it would not - tie logical to have three satell.ites together like that, and even ii' they were synchronized to ,fly together, they ccrtzinly coulc! not hc\"s.5 had, such a brightness and intcnsity. Besides, the satellites follow .a specific trajectory and maintain F certain speed.\" The7 young members of theCroatian Natural Science Society, Astron- omy Department were at a loss to explain the origin of these objects, Even the most renowned world scientists zre un3blc to produce a con- vincing answer tc this problem 2nd it is all b2sed on theoretical postulates. The pictures taken b the young Zagreb c..stranomers .will be a. valuzble contribution for their further studies,, \"1 do not believe until I have seen,\" ~qints out Zeljko Jakupec, a medical student. \"ht, here my colle~k-ues hsve seen sonisthing indeed unusual.
