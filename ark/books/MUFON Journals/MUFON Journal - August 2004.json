Schuessler MUFON 2004 International UFO Symposium The symposium was very successful this year. Attendance was excellent, the speak- ers did a super job, the extra events were quite enjoyable, people look ad- vantage of the opportunity to talk to others that they seldom see, and even the weather cooper- ated. The theme of the event was \"The Body Of Technological Evidence.\" While we made it clear that there is firm evidence of the operation of unconventional flying objects in the skies all over the world, we only scratched the surface of that body of evidence. Much more is yet to be documented and revealed. Many thanks go to the participants: Stephen Bassett, John Brandenberg, Grant Cameron, Peter Davenport, Paul Davids, John Greenewald, Paola Har- John Sclmesslet ris, Budd Hopkins, Leslie Kean, Deborah Lindemann, Bruce Maccabee, Nick Redfern, David Sereda, Leo Sprinkle, Marshall Summers, Ken Storch, and Ryan Wood. I am pleased that 1 could also be one of the presenters at this event. We also thank the outstanding Colorado MUFON team for hosting the symposium. State Director Leslie Varnicle and her talented organization were everywhere, doing everything necessary to plan and conduct the event. Symposium Chair Lin Simpson was in constant motion for weeks before the event and throughout the whole symposium. She was very successful in her quest to make the symposium a responsible, smooth run- ning, and enjoyable event.

NM. Doug Nolan and Bill Ferguson, local employees of the El Paso Oil Company, were called out to a mesa just off of Hart Canyon road to inspect a brush fire, sighted near one of the company's drip tanks. Upon arriving at the mesa the men would soon discover a large disc lying on the western side of the mesa. \"The craft was extremely large,\" Doug recalled. I had interviewed him last Au- gust at his home in Las Vegas while he was still recovering from a series of recent strokes. He has told this same story over the years to selected people, but now he wants it on record. Since my research began on the Aztec Incident. I have always been amazed at how this story has been mostly overlooked for 56 years. I first started my research after a business trip that took me to the Four Corners area. That was in October of 1988. A customer I was calling on at the time had employed a large number of Navajo Indians from the local reservation. I over- heard them talking about a meeting planned for the following Saturday to hunt mule deer \"near the old crash site.\" I cautiously asked them, \"What old crash site?\" They explained to me that a Area H 'here the crash and retrieval reportedly took place. Note the cement pad. local story had been circulating in the area for years that \"a flying saucer had landed up on a mesa\" off of Hart Canyon road, northeast of Aztec, about 22 miles from where I was staying in Farmington, N.M. After I returned from my business trip, I did a little digging into the old Aztec UFO story. I was shocked to discover that Frank Scully had devoted a book to the incident, in 1950. It was the second book on the sub- ject of UFOs after the one that Maj. Donald Kehoe (retired) had written in paperback form the previous year. After locating a copy of the book, I read About the author Scott and Suzanne Ramsey Scott Ramsey does not consider him- self a UFO investigator, but rather an in- vestigator of undocumented history. His background includes working for companies in the electrical industry, includ- ing General Electric and Essex Interna- tional, and is vice president of a small Mag- net Wire company in Charlotte. NC. Stan Friedman notes, \"I have spent a lot of time with Scott, and am very favor- ably impressed with him. I think the ar- ticle is very well done. Scott is a solid en- gineer. I, too. was anti-Aztec, but have changed my mind and have spoken at three of the annual celebrations.\" Scott spoke at the Aztec UFO Sympo- sium this past March. Every year the Az- tec Public Library hosts a symposium in March which centers on UFOs and related research as a topic. Details on this event can be found at www.aztecufo.com. Scott and UFO investigators appear in a new documentary entitled \"Aztec 1948\" that is being released at this time. Scott and Suzanne are working on a book titled Fallen Angel. Recovery At Hart Canyon to be released later this year or early 2005. Scott and Suzanne reside in Mooresville, NC, where they operate a small vinyard.

Later I read articles by J.P. Cahn claim- ing that the story was a big hoax, and that Scully's sources were a bunch of con men. The more I dug into the story, the more nothing really made any sense. How could a seasoned writer like Scully have been duped by a bunch of con men? I read more articles over time that re- ally gave the Aztec case a black eye. But why? It seemed almost fashionable to \"dis- credit\" anything to do with Aztec. I decided that, since my travels would take me to the Four Corners for business every two to three months, I would do my own research on the \"Aztec Incident,\" as I like to call it. It seems that one area in which Aztec draws criticism is through claims of the lack of eyewitnesses to the event. How- ever, that seems not to be the case. First, let's look at who Scully was (for all those who haven't followed the his- tory). Scully was a well known writer back in the late forties up through the sixties. He wrote for many popular magazines, including Variety magazine, and was one of the most popular journalists of his day. (Keep in mind that newsprint and radio were the mainstream media of that time.) Scully would be compared to the present day Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, or Tom Brokaw. In 1949 he meets Silas Newton, an oil prospector who tells of a high-ranking sci- entist who had allegedly worked on a re- covered \"flying saucer program\" for the U.S. Government. Scully had been ap- proached because of his reputation as a highly respectable journalist at the time. The \"scientist,\" as Frank Scully later recalled, was not just one individual, but a group of eight scientists that he refers to collectively as \"Dr. Gee.\" Scully's book, Behind The Flying Sau- cers, devoted a number of pages discuss- ing the mysterious \"Dr. Gee.\" Many crit- ics have alleged that Dr. Gee was actually Leo Gebauer, a close friend of Silas Newton's who leaked the story to Scully. Although Scully's book was very im- portant to the history behind the Aztec In- cident, I will use other methods in provid- ing facts behind the story. Whoever Dr. Gee was, he was very much \"in the loop\" concerning government projects at the time. I examined several claims made by Dr. Gee in order to see if they could be proven, 50 years later. [Journal readers may recall that Chris Evans, in an article in the October, 2003, issue, identified Dr. Walter Russell as \"Dr. Gee.\" This has been the Aztec Story from the beginning. Amazingly the story has re- mained consistent for over 56 years that on March 25, 1948, a large craft measur- ing about 100 ft. in diameter, 6 ft. in height, and showing no signs of damage, \"soft landed\" on a mesa above Hart Canyon road, approximately 12 miles northeast of the town of Aztec. There were from 14 to 16 humanoid bodies, apparently charred or burned, re- moved from the craft. The bodies ranged from 36 to 48 inches in height. They were wearing navy-blue, one-piece jump suits. The craft was first discovered by two local oil field workers, and within hours the mesa had attracted local ranchers, other oil field workers, two law-enforcement officers, and then, finally, the military. After the military arrived, they swore all of the witnesses to secrecy, and then reminded them of their \"patriotic duty.\" After the manner and tone by which the oil field workers and ranchers had been warned, they quietly left the heavily pa- trolled mesa and went about their business. In order to remove the craft, an access road had to be cut, and a concrete slab had to be poured for supporting a large crane, used to remove the large craft. The removal process took two weeks. Heavy equipment was also brought in from three or four re- gional military installations. The hills around the mesa were patrolled Frank Scully (photo courtesy of Wendy Connors) by the military, and not even the oil field workers could see what was going on near the mesa. Finally, piece by piece the ob- ject was removed to some remote govern- ment facility. Now, let's look at the story and start adding in some facts, eyewitnesses, and some good old fashioned research behind the Aztec Incident. Dr. Gee's secret radar bases Both in Scully's Behind The Flying Saucers, and then Bill Steinman and Wendelle Stevens' UFO Crash At Aztec, a reference to \"secret radar bases\" is found. The first mention of this comes from \"Dr. Gee\" of Scully's book. Dr. Gee claimed that the U.S. Govern- ment had three 'Top Secret\" radar bases in northern New Mexico that were tracking the errant UFO the morning of March 25, 1948. As noted, the same claim by Steinman and Stevens is in their book as well. In July of 1998 I started looking for these alleged 'Top Secret radar bases.\" I first investigated claims of a radar base located outside of Pittsburgh, PA, that is still in existence, but is now used as an FAA navigational radar system. The old base was once a Nike missile installation during the Cold War days. I soon found that they have a base \"his- torian\" at the site by the name of Pat McHugh. He was quite happy to sit with me and go over all of the old AC&W bases that he had in his files. Quickly we both learned that New Mexico did not have a radar base listed that matched any of Dr. Gee's claims. Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal August 2004"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The next step was to round up a group of adventurers and seek out some old USGS maps of New Mexico, and then try to find a logical spot as to where these bases may have been. By January of 1999 we had found our first radar base. It was called the 767th AC&W, located in El Vado, NM, approximately 65 miles north of Los Alamos National Laboratory. After many painstaking hours spent search- ing the Air Force archives, we learned that these bases were built by The Atomic En- ergy Commission back in 1946 as a means of protection for Los Alamos, Sandia Na- tional Labs, and Kirkland Air Force Base. The bases were later turned over to the Air Force in 1950, but were closed by 1957, as newer technology had rendered them obsolete. By the end of our sixth trip to Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, AL, we had located the other two. Finally, we had identified all three of the bases de- scribed by Dr. Gee in 1949. Finding these bases put a feather in Dr. Gee's hat. Now we had most of the de- classified documents naming the bases, and we quickly realized that these were truly \"Top Secret bases.\" The military had been experimenting with some very powerful new radar tech- nology that was being tested for the U.S. Navy, while protecting the skies above New Mexico. After pouring over thousands of pages of monthly and quarterly reports, we soon learned the importance of these bases for the '40s and '50s. Now, back to Dr. Gee. If someone back in 1949 knew about these bases, then they were someone that was \"in the know\" even then. This is but one of the many claims made by Dr. Gee over fifty years ago that have merit. In the interest of keeping this article short, we will elaborate more on this in the future. Witness No. 1 One argument against the Aztec Inci- dent, waged by critics over the years, has been a claim of lack of eyewitnesses. In our early research into the Aztec Incident, we found it very difficult to speak with anyone from the town that might \"go on the record.\" I was finding myself returning to the Four Corners area about every six to seven weeks, just as I thought I would. Over many weekends I researched the story, looking for an eyewitness to this historical event. Finally, people slowly started to come for- ward. Our first witness was Ken Farley. When we interviewed Ken, he was dying of a respiratory disease. He was on bottled oxy- gen when we met, north of Phoenix, AZ. As Ken later described to me during a three-hour interview, he had been in Durango, CO, on March 25, 1948, visit- ing his aunt on his way to San Diego, CA. He was supposed to meet a friend north of Aztec, NM, and then continue his drive to San Diego. As he arrived early that morning at a planned pick-up spot near Cedar Hill (a small town just north of Az- tec), his \"friend\" told him about a lot of trucks and a police car seen going out a small dirt readjust south of their position. The drivers of the vehicles seemed to be in a hurry, according to Ken. Thinking an emergency was underway, the two of them decided to go out and see what the problem was. Ken and his friend (anonymous) arrived at the mesa, now apparently busy with oil field workers and what appeared to have been local ranchers. Ken and his friend moved toward the west side of the mesa to get a better look at a large disc that sat silently on the mesa and had, as Ken described, \"no noticeable damage.\" The craft was \"perfectly smooth on the outside, with no seams or marking except for around the middle of the craft.\" Ken also described two police officers at the scene who were talking to the locals. Finally, the one officer walked over to Ken and his friend and told them that the military had been notified and that they should leave the area at once. Ken and his friend refused to leave, be- cause nobody else seemed to be listening to the officer. Ken recalls that some of the oil field workers were climbing \"all over the damn thing, which was absolutely stu- pid. Some older folks started yelling at them to get the hell away from it.\" Finally, later that morning, according to Ken, the military arrived and discussed the incident individually with the people on the mesa. Ken has claimed they were \"threatened with their lives\" and sworn to secrecy. Since Ken was not originally from the area, he could not help me identify who the othersmight have been. Witness No. 2 Doug Nolan and Bill Ferguson were employed by the El Paso Gas Company. Doug, 19 years of age, had just picked up his boss, Bill Ferguson, at 5 AM. Bill had told Doug that they needed to get out to Hart Canyon road as fast as possible, due to a bad brush fire that was spotted near a drip tank. As the two arrived, they were greeted by other oil field workers who explained that the brush fire was under control, but that they needed to see something else out on the mesa. As they arrived at the mesa, Doug said they could not believe what they were looking at. A very large metallic disc sat silently on the mesa. Doug explained that as they cautiously moved closer, they realized the craft was smooth with no noticeable seams, rivets, bolts, or weld marks. He said it looked as if it had been molded. Doug and Bill climbed up on the craft and looked through a broken porthole. He recalls seeing two bodies slumped over what he thought was a control panel. Other oil field workers were climbing around the craft looking for a way to enter, when oth- ers started to arrive and advise the men to move away from the craft. A Mr. and Mrs. Knight (local ranchers running cattle out near the mesa) arrived in their pickup truck and began to walk slowly toward the craft. Nearing daybreak (as Doug would recall) a helicopter started to circle the mesa. Doug said this was un- believable as well, because he had never seen a helicopter before! [Keep in mind that helicopters had just recently been in- troduced to the military at that time.] During my interview with Doug, he re- called that the first law enforcement officer to show up acted as though he had not known anyone. Doug approached the young officer and asked what they should all do? The officer explained that he was from the town of Cuba, NM, and (hat he had followed the low flying disc in the early morning hours, and then, finally, to the area of Hart Canyon road. He also explained to Doug that the town of Cuba had several sightings over those past few weeks. Doug would later recall that a second law enforcement officer also showed up. This officer was well known by most of the local people at the site. This ties in with Keri Farley's story about two police officers at the crash site. Doug was able to name everyone at the crash site, with the exception of two young men who stood on the western side of the mesa. He had not seen them either prior to or after the incident. Witness No. 3 Fred Reed, who had previously worked for the O.S.S. (Office of Strategic Ser- vices), and his group were sent to Aztec, NM, to \"clean up a crash site\" early in April 1948. Shortly after they arrived it was apparent to them that something very large had been removed from the site. Their specialty was to make an area appear as if nothing had transpired there. Fred revisited the crash site in 1999, and I was able to interview him one week later. August 2004 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"In 1948 they were ordered to collect any foreign items they found, bury them eigh- teen inches deep, and to \"soft landscape\" any areas where heavy equipment tracks were visible. They were also to do an extensive sur- vey on the entire mesa. He noted a newly- cut road and an out-of-place, large con- crete pad in the freshly altered and silty soil during the cleanup. Reed recalled thinking that they must have poured it to support a heavy structure, such as a crane, used to move a large object. At the time of the cleanup, his group was informed that it was simply a crash site. The entire cleanup was done in the usual quiet manner that Reed had been ac- customed to in the O.S.S. Years later, one of Reed's former senior officers would ex- plain to him that it was not an aircraft crash, but that of a large metallic \"flying disc.\" In my interview with Reed, he com- mented on how the crash site today looks much the same as they had left it when they had finished. He recalled that the tops of the trees were broken, and was fascinated with how they had weathered with time. Witness 4 During our research on the Aztec Inci- dent, we came across a name in several old declassified reports. This person kept receiving all the ufo reports. We figured that, since this person was getting all the \"good reports,\" maybe he would know something about the Aztec Incident. In trying to keep this article at a rea- sonable length, I'll skip to the details of our interview that took place after two years of hard research in tracking him down. When I first contacted him by phone, I explained that I was doing research on his old Air Force group, and that I would love to sit and interview him. He agreed, and we met at a hotel lobby bar for a drink on a cold winter night. I brought with me most of the declassified files that I had which talked about his Intel group from back then. I wasted little time in getting to the Aztec questions. He then slowly and reluctantly talked about the Aztec Crash, as he called it. He admitted that he was not at the crash site, but did read daily intel reports on the clean- up and progress of the removal. His job was to keep track of the people at the site and carefully monitor all reports. He was stationed at Walker Field (for- merly Roswell Army Air Field) in March of 1948. He explained to me that every- thing was very compartmentalized during the recovery operation. His job was mainly to keep personnel files on everyone in- Close-up of the concrete pad as it was dug up in the 1980's. volved, and to make sure that the records would never show their presence in that part of the country. He did see black and white photos of the \"extremely large craft. He told me dur- ing our interview that after the \"botched attempt at Roswell, they were getting bet- ter at their intel.\" He explained to me that the only person he ever discussed this with was his wife before she passed away. When I asked him how the military felt about Frank Scully's book, he recalled that the military was not so upset with Frank Scully, but very concerned as to who \"leaked the story to Scully.\" This witness was very good about con- firming certain details about some of my questions, but very reluctant on some items. He told me that the work force at the site consisted of about 200 persons during the two-week recovery. This he could easily remember, because of the huge paperwork process that he did daily . He gave me some clues as to the crash site, not knowing that we had already found some, but it was great to hear him confirm this. He mentioned a small delay in the first few days of the recovery, due to some prob- lems with a freshly cut road. The soil near the crash site was very moist and sandy, and created problems for moving in some heavy equipment. He told me to look for some \"footers\" or \" concrete foundations\" that had to be poured in order for the equipment to be stable. He did not remember exactly what equipment was involved, but when I men- tioned a crane, he thought it was correct. \" When asked wilere this craft was taken, he explained that he would not have been ^privileged to that information. However he explained that, after the recovery, he was responsible for reclaiming some of the equipment that was used. The equipment, he recalled, was at Los Alamos. Witness 5 Virgel Riggs was a young man in the Air Force back in the early sixties. He had just arrived at RAF Welford near the Newbury, Berkshire, area of England. He had been at the base one month when he met a fellow airman whose name will not be released at this time. Upon learning that Virgel was raised in the Four Corners area of New Mexico, this airman was very curious to learn if Virgel had ever heard of the Aztec UFO story in nearby Aztec. Virgel replied that he had heard the story growing up as a child. As time went on, and Virgel and the air- man became close friends, the airman told Virgel that the Aztec UFO story was not just an old wives tale, as some thought it was. When Virgel asked the airman what he meant by that, the airman stated that he \"was part of the recovery team during the Aztec operation.\" This obviously shocked Virgel but he had no reason to doubt what his good friend was telling him. A year or two later, the airman was shipped off to Viet Nam and Virgel has never seen him Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal August 2004"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"since. During the past year we have been looking for this airman. By a stroke of luck, as Virgel was go- ing through some records that he kept, he found a copy of some orders that listed the airman and his AF #. We are currently try- ing to find him. So the Aztec story goes on from here. The \"concrete slab\" that is at the crash site is undergoing testing at a U.S. lab. A core sample was taken in 2003, and the testing will prove the age of the concrete, plus or minus six months. All rebar is coded with numbers that show who made it, and when it was made. So within the year, we should know if the concrete slab plays a part in the Aztec In- cident. Also, we have more eye-witnesses than the five in this article. I didn't want to over- load the story with too much and run the article too long. I have traveled to 28 states, interviewed 60 credible people, visited several ar- chives, and spent more than $200,000 of our own money researching this case. My wife, Suzanne, has been a key part of my research. We were married this past Oct. 18. I met her as a result of my re- search, and she has been helping me for years. She has put up with all my crazy travel, and I have dragged her across the country doing this research. Last summer she got to see what it was like crawling around dusty archives in Alabama! Suzanne had a radio program in Farmington, NM, called \"For Your Infor- mation,\" and has had guest speakers on ev- ery year who were in town for the Aztec UFO Symposium. This article is simply an overview of some of the research that we have done in 16 years. The research continues, and will continue until we feel that we have looked at every aspect of this historical event. Undocumented history has been-and al- ways will be-our driving force in research- ing this event. This year, the first-ever documentary on Aztec is coming out. The production was done by Redstar Films, the same company that did the documentary on Stanton Fried- man entitled, \"Stanton Friedman is Real,\" and the newly-released documentary titled, \"Do You Believe in Majic,\" which deals with the Majestic 12 Documents. The Aztec documentary is entitled \"Az- tec 1948,\" and can be purchased on-line at www.aztecl948.com A portion of the proceeds will benefit the local Aztec Pub- lic Library as they raise funds to build a new library.

(Photo by Fran Geremia, NH MUFON) Scientists find galaxies older than believed JOHNS HOPIONS UNIVERSITY - A rare glimpse back in time into the universe's early development has revealed something startling: mature, fully formed galaxies where scientists expected to dis- cover little more than infants. \"Up until now, we assumed that galax- ies were just beginning to form between 8 and 11 billion years ago, but what we found suggests that that is not the case,\" said Karl Glazebrook, associate professor of phys- ics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins Uni- versity in Baltimore and co-principal au- thor of a paper in the July 8 issue of Na- ture. \"It seems that an unexpectedly large fraction of stars in big galaxies were al- ready in place early in the universe's for- mation-and that challenges what we've believed. We thought massive galaxies came much later.\" Using the Gemini Telescope in Hawaii, Glazebrook and a multinational team of researchers called the Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS) employed a special tech- nique called the \"Nod and Shuffle\" to peer into what had traditionally been a cosmo- logical blind spot. Law officer sights object By Tom Sheets MUFON Georgia State Director A veteran law enforcement officer in the extreme corner of northeast Georgia filed a very well written WUFOD report with MUFON of Georgia (MUFONGA) on 23 June 04 that described the following event. On 23 May 04, at about 2:11 AM, the 57-year-old officer was performing a night surveillance detail in an area where re- peated vandalism and trespass had oc- curred. Pan of his equipment included a night vision device-not goggles, but rather like non-magnifying binoculars. The target area was quiet, with no one around, so the officer pointed the device skyward to ob- serve the stars for a moment. After observing the sky for a few sec- onds, he saw a dark object moving from west to east, though there was no sound, and no lights on the craft. He stated the craft shape was very odd, like two busi- ness letter envelopes-one viewed length- wise, with the other lying across it slightly forward of center, perpendicular, exclu- sively 90-degree angles. The officer said that prior to becoming a LE officer, he was a professional pilot for 25 years on the west coast, and he had never observed anything even remotely like this craft. He stated the object was about the size of an aspirin at arm's length, and, making comparisons, perhaps about the size of a DC-9 or 737 at approximately 10,000 ft. altitude. Additional WUFOD data fields: 65-70 degrees elevation, over 1 mile distant, ru- ral site, and clear sky. This case has been forwarded to Don Nellesen, MUFONGA's DD for NE Georgia, for additional scru- tiny.

August 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2004 MUFON Symposium speakers explore the technological evidence Schuessler The 2004 MUFON International Sym- posium speakers covered a variety of top- ics under the general theme of \"Uncon- ventional Flying Objects: The Body of Technological Evidence.\" Papers of each of the 12 speakers are included in the 3'5\" 1 AnnualInternational UFO Symposium Proceedings, available for $25.00 plus $2.50 S&H from MUFON. Following is a summary of these presenta- tions. John Schues- sler, International Director of MU- FON: \"UFOs: The Body of Techno- logical Evidence.\" Schuessler points out that \"it is no longer necessary to refer to UFOs as unidentified,\" since \"we have amassed sufficient evidence to show that the are 'unconventiaonal,' rather than 'unidenti- fied.'\" He notes that files everywhere are teem- ing with what courts would accept as evi- dence, including: (1) first-hand knowledge, represented by eyewitness reports from individuals such as Charles Hickson (Pascagoula) and airline pilots and astronauts; (2) expert testimony, such as by Stanton Friedman and Dr. Jacques Vallee; (3) competent witnesses, such as mili- tary, law enforcement, and air intelligence personnel; (4) demonstrative evidence, such as ra- dar sightings, ground traces, and physical injuries; and (5) authentication, such as U.S. govern- ment and foreign government documents. Collectively, this is the \"best evidence,\" says Schuessler, even though no single case will likely contain all of these elements. He concludes. \"We must start treating the evidence we have as a 'body of evi- dence' instead of acting like it is a group of unrelated reports.\" Stephen Bassett, UFO lobbyist for government disclosure: \"Deception, Denial, and Disclosure.\" Bassett disagrees with such individuals Bassett as John Lear and Art Bell who contend that \"the truth regarding the extraterrestrial presence is too disturbing and too danger- ous for public consumption, and should be withheld until such time as the government feels the public can deal with the facts.\" Bassett says there are two things that are certain: (1) there is an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race, and (2) no one in the field of extraterres- trial-related phe- nomena research/ activism knows the big picture. No one has it right. \"Thus,\" he says, any decision to de- lay disclosure by the government until the public is edu- cated \"has the pro- found deficiency of being based upon a substantial portion of false information. In other words, because of the cover-up, it is not possible to estab- lish a fully valid scenario.\" Given this situation, he asks, \"Does the human race wish to move forward in igno- rance and fear driven by government-im- posed information embargoes, or advance with as much truth as can be wrung from science, common sense, and government files?\" Even assuming that the entities may be hostile, Bassett notes that terrorists are also hostile, yet \"who would advocate withhold- ing all information of terrorist threats from the public in order to keep them calm?\" He adds, \"More importantly, who can truly estimate the defensive power of 260 million people focused on specific mea- sures?\" Basset also contends that \"thanks to the need to maintain the cover-up, much of the technology is being withheld from public use.\" He also thinks that disclosure is more likely to turn people toward God, than away, since he feels those committed to religion will.find a way to incorporate en- tities into it [as the Catholic church has already done to some extent]. Three questions must be considered re- garding disclosure, says Bassett: (1) whether to hold a disclosure event or continue the cover-up, (2) how comprehensive and truthful the initial information disclosed will be, and (3) whether to create a military, hostile posture toward the extraterrestrials ac- knowledged in this disclosure event. In discussing how disclosure should occur, Bassett says it should have the fol- lowing elements: (1) be bi-partisan, (2) key parties should be briefed, (3) initiated by the President, but quickly shifted to a group made up of gov- ernment officials, religious leaders, and social leaders, who will continue to brief the public and be open to questions from the press, and (4) followed by Congressional fact-find- ing hearings that will extend over a period of several years. He acknowledges that disclosure will not be an easy process, but says, \"Failure to rise to the difficult is how major nations fall. Good government is difficult.\" Grant Cameron, research specialist in the link between UFOs, government, and politicians: \"Seeking a Checkmate Move: A Search for Conclusive Tech- nological Evidence.\" Cameron deals with the difficulty of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that UFOs represent someone else's advanced technology, comparing this with proving that the world is round. Such common elements of proof as \"common reality,\" \"visual evidence,\" \"photographic evi- dence,\" \"government documents,\" \"UFO hardware and bodies.\" \"crash retrievals.\" and \"expert witness testi- mony\" are explored. He concludes that, though difficult, it is possible to prove the existence of alien tech- nology and UFOs if all the evidence is made available. Cameron Peter Davenport, director of the Na- tional UFO Reporting Center: \"Using Multistatic Passive Radar for Real-time PageS MUFON UFO Journal August 2004"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Detection of UFOs in the Near-Earth Environment.\" Davenport explains that \"new develop- ments in passive, multistatic radar and re- lated technologies will permit for the first time in the history of ufology the remote, real-time detection of UFOs in the near-Earth envi- ronment. He adds, \"Not only will the pro- posed system de- tect the presence of suspected UFOs. but it will also per- mit determination of their flight char- Davenport acteristics, such as velocity, acceleration, flight path, and per- haps size.\" Davenport notes that traditional radar is expensive, and has characteristics which \"make it less than optimal, particularly for detection of very high velocity targets.\" Passive radar, however, requires no transmitter, only multiple receivers, and (1) can detect targets continuously, (2) can de- tect over a wide area, (3) can be operated in virtually any location, and (4) is rela- tively inexpensive. While the concept of passive radar is not new, the spread of inexpensive high speed computers, coupled with the rela- tively recent deployment of the U.S. Glo- bal Positioning System (GPS) which al- lows very accurate time and location mea- surements, makes a workable passive ra- dar system feasible. Davenport discusses in general terms the construction and operation of a passive radar system, utilizing commercial FM radio and TV signals, the U.S. Navy Sur- veillance System Transmitter, or the Uni- versity of Washington passive system. Deborah Lindemann, Certified Reg- istered Clinical Hypnotherapist: \"Sig- natures of Extraordinary Technology in Abduction.\" Ms. Lindemann focused primarily on the Stanley Romanek case, which she and others have written about in the Journal. She dis- cussed the roles Lindemann of video tapes, orbs, \"out of place knowledge,\" physical evidence, sounds, and \"anomalous fogs\" in trying to decipher abduction cases. David Sereda, investigator into the scientific community of NASA: \" Has NASA Made Contact with Extraterres- trial Intelligence?\" Sereda suggests that video cameras aboard NASA space shuttles have re- corded UFOs, and that an analysis of these objects shows that they have con- verted mass into light, and can thus travel at the speed of light, as well as dis- appear into the invis- Sereda ible light spectrum. Nick Redfern, UFO author and lec- turer: \"Flying Triangles in British Air- space: Evidence of Advanced Technol- ogy.\" Redfern says that early in 1993 there was a series \"of truly earth-shattering UFO encounters\" in British airspace which had \"a profound ef- fect on high ranking sources within both the Royal Air Force and the Ministry of Defense. He adds that this \"ultimately con- vinced British mili- tary and defense per- sonnel that the phe- nomenon was one that clearly demon- strated the presence of an advanced, high performance technology.\" In looking over these several cases, Redfern asks, \"If the bulk of these vehicles are domestic in origin, and we have been in possession of them for decades, why are we not utilizing such advanced technology on the battlefield?\" Ryan Wood, Majestic documents re- searcher: \"Evidence for the Existence of TOP SECRET/MJ-12—A Forensic Examination of Leaked Classified Documents.\" Wood presented the results of his in- vestigation into what he describes as \"two leaked original docu- ments comprising over 342 pages of Top Secret MJ-12 material.\" He discussed the authentication prin- Redfem ciples of provenance, paper and ink analy- sis, content analysis, authenticity \"zingers,\" and anachronisms. One of these documents is An Encyclo- pedia of Flying Saucers, a book by Vernon Bowen. The other document is a 12-page memo allegedly from CIA Director Allen Dulles (presumedly MJ-1) toother MJ-12 mem- bers setting up a series of eight directives concerning the government's handling of the UFO problem, which is considered \"a national security threat.\" After explaining how the documents have been authenticated, as well as their contents. Wood concludes, \"For the first time in the history of ufology we have origi- nal documents that have been forensically tested and are arguably genuine. \"This is a watershed event that should be in the papers and spread far and wide, but the media sensitivity, either engineered by a long-standing government effort, or simply the fear of ridicule and embarrass- ment, will force credible outlets to play this evidence very low key.\" Leslie Kean, freelance investigative journalist: \"Combating Media Ridicule and Searching for Evidence on the 1965 Kecksburg Crash Case.\" Ms. Kean discussed both the COMETA report and the Kecksburg crash. The COMETA report, prepared by top retired French military and space officials, stated that numerous manifestations observed by reliable witnesses and other evidence sug- gest that the craft are of extraterrestrial origin, and that this conclusion \"is loaded with significant con- sequences,\" including the need for interna- tional cooperative ac- tion. Noting that the U.S. media mostly ig- nored the report, Ms. Kean discussed the influences operating within the media. In the second part of her presentation, she discussed the famous Kecksburg UFO crash of 1965 near Kecksburg, PA. This case has been extensively dealt with by Stan Gordon, who made an award-winning documentary video of his investigation. The Coalition for Freedom of Informa- tion (CFI), for which Kean is director of investigations, has taken on the case with Gordon's assistance, utilizing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as well as a private investigtor, legal counsel, and other Kean August 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"resources. Several explanations for the reported crashed object have been ruled out, such as space debris and a meteor. A year ago Dr. Ray Hicks of West Vir- ginia University documented tree damage at the site which matched earlier photos. After taking core samples, he determined that something did come down at an angle which matched witness testimony, and that the damage did occur in 1965. Paul Davids, author and filmmaker: \"Profiles in UFO Courage.\" Davids, whose father played a signifi- cant role in the writing of JFK's book Pro- files in Courage, took this concept and applied it to the UFO field, citing several individuals he admires for com- ing forward with in- formation or for making statements. Included are as- tronauts Edgar Mitchell and Gor- don Cooper; writers Donald Keyhoe, Frank Scully, Frank Edwards, Bob Pratt, Billy Cox, Leslie Kean, and Terry Hanson; philanthropist Lawrence Rockefeller; po- litical leaders Barry Goldwater, Gerald Ford, and Steven Schiff, and numerous in- dividuals in TV, radio, and films. Budd Hopkins: \"UFO Abduction Cases: The Medical Evidence\" Veteran abduction researcher Budd Hopkins discussed the need for more medi- cal research in UFO cases, which means more medical doctors getting involved in ufology. (I did note at least two MDs on hand for the symposium.) Budd discussed several cases to show that medical cases feature evi- dence that goes well beyond wit- ness testimony. Davids \"Some crtics claim we ufolo- gists are a cult,\" he explained, \"but we are the opposite of cults. Cults have a theology and no evidence, but we have the evidence and no theology to ex- plain it.\" Hopkins reported that the cases he has examined included various types of physi- cal effects, some injuries, and an occasional healing. Scoop marks are very common, he said, and can be just about any place on the body. They appear on both adults and children, and suggest that cells are being removed for study, as in a punch biopsy, \"but we just don't know the purpose,\" he admitted. He also showed photos of precision cuts, some short and some long, and sometimes accompanied by bruises. Often the indi- vidual cannot recall receiving these, but often try to make up some explanation, such as insect bites. Hopkins also noted other marks, such as the ligature rings around the ankles of some of the individuals in the Kelly Cahill case in Australia, as well as grid patterns on some individuals which match those in other cases. Budd also dealt briefly with implants, telling of a woman in an apparent abduc- tion witnessing the horrifying insertion of a needle-like device into the eye of a man lying on a table. In another case a child drew a picture of a needle being inserted into the eye of another child during an ap- parent abduction experience, causing con- tinuing trauma for the child who witnessed this. Hopkins noted that the eye socket seems to be a good place to insert implants, and that x-rays often show pieces of metal in the overall skull area of abductees. A case in point is the famous \"Linda Cortile\" case, where an x-ray showed an object in her nose which seemed to later disappear, leav- ing only a bloody spot. Budd also told of the case of a little girl who had reported anomalous experiences, and whose father was in the military, sta- tioned in Germany. Following a bicycle accident in Italy, a head x-ray showed a metallic object in her head which could not be explained. However, a second x-ray back in Germany showed no object. \"This happens again and again,\" said Hopkins. Gynecological anomalies have been found in several of his cases, suggesting interest by the abducting entities in repro- duction. In one case a woman saw strange lights outside her window, and awoke the next morning with itching around her genitals, but she told herself it was nothing. How- ever, it happened again, and she consulted a physician, who found that her inner la- bia had been sliced off. The inner labia, or labia minora, are smaller folds of skin next to the vagina. Increased blood flow during sexual arousal causes them to enlarge. The physician had no explanation for the sliced labia. In another case, a physician found per- fectly round holes in the labia, with no sign of bleeding, even though there should have been bleeding-again with no medical ex- planation. Another woman gave birth through Ce- sarean section, but the examining physi- cian also found that a fallopian tube and an ovary had apparently been surgically removed, despite the fact that the woman had not had any surgery. Although her hus- band had apparently had some anomalous experiences, the woman had not con- sciously recalled any. In another case a woman with prior anomalous experiences had a Cesarean section, then a second Cesarian section for the birth of another child, both with the same physician. However, between the two Cesarean sections the woman had somehow lost her right ovary, which mys- tified the physician. Hopkins noted that all of the ova that a woman will ever produce are already in the ovaries, leading to a suggestion that removing the ovary may be a method used by entities for harvesting human ova. While these cases are certainly trau- matic, a case being worked on by Bob and Sue S wiatek is not only traumatic, but also life threatening. This involves a 33-year-old man who reported a \"dream\" in which he was stretched out on a table, surrounded by three entities. The entities were described as human size, with blond hair, olive-col- ored skin, and large ice-blue eyes-the transgenic or hybrid types. The man reported that a large machine was placed over his chest and upper stom- ach area, and apparently activated, caus- ing a slight warm feeling in his body, which he said actually felt good. However, one of the entities leaned over him and telepathically said, \"I'm so sorry, but we have hurt you. We will always try to help you and never forget you.\" The man said the entities looked puzzled. Two weeks later the man suffered chest pains, and sought medical help. He was diagnosed with fluid around the heart, which had apparently drained from his lungs. A check of his lungs indicated they had been suddenly burned, with both lungs showing identical blistering at the tops and additional damage. An x-ray a year ear- lier for a bronchial illness had shown no such damage. Doctors first inquired whether the man had inhaled hot gases or a caustic chemi- cal, or if he had handled radioactive sub- stances. This latter inquiry made the man Page 10 MUFON Journal August 2004"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"fearful that he would be suspected of be- ing a terrrorist. The man was afraid to tell doctors about his \"dream.\" However, doctors decided that the sym- metrical damage had to have been caused by something mechanical, but they could not determine the cause. In any case, lung transplants were suggested-sooner rather than later. Although the man is still reluctant to tie his illness to an abduction event, Hopkins says he is coming to that conclusion, and wants to leave his lungs to a UfO group for study. Hopkins says that cases of interest in lungs by entities is rare, as most cases in- volve the reproductive system or the cen- tral nervous system. Still another case discussed by Hopkins involved a man and three others in a car who encountered a very intense light. Then the man suddenly found himself at home in bed. Following the encounter, the man, who was in his 60's, quickly experienced cata- racts in both eyes. The doctor asked him if he had been staring intensly at ultravio- let light. A very strange case described by Hopkins involved a 43-year-old man liv- ing in New York City who seemed to have been involved in a pattern of abduction- like events since childhood, as were his brother and sister, who still lived in the Midwest. Working out of town in a remote area of Pennsylvania, the man was surprised to find bright lights outside his window twice in the same week, and he felt he had expe- rienced a period of missing time. Shortly thereafter he began to suffer from warts and rashes, especially around his genitals. Being homosexual, he feared some sort of venereal disease, although he said he practiced \"safe sex.\" The rash was diagnosed as sun damage, but those areas had not been exposed to the sun. He also began to suffer night terror, and a dread and,a fear that seemed irrational. A month after his period of missing time, his right testicle shrank to the size of a pea, but he experienced no pain. Again he sus- pected some sort of venereal disease. He consulted five different urologists, all of whom said there was no problem because there was no pain connected with the shrinking. Finally he consulted a therapist who was also an M.D., and it was determined that the testicle was dead, and needed to be re- moved quickly. John Greenewald, FOIA specialist and creator of The Black Vault: \"The US. Government's Present Day UFO Interest: The Black Vault Uncovers What the Government Doesn't Want Your to See.\" Greenewald, who began searching government docu- ments via the Free- dom of Information Act (FOIA) eight years ago at the age of 15, has now com- piled more than 100,000 pages of government docu- ments on his intrigu- ing website, The Black Vault (www.- blackvault.com). He has also written a very interesting book about his experiences entitled Beyond UFO Secrecy. In his presentation at the symposium, he discussed his surprise at the number of government documents related to the UFO phenomenon. It did not take him long to learn that the government's stated disin- terest in UFOs is pure fiction. One of the most interesting of the gov- ernment documents uncovered is the \"1976 Iran Incident\" involving two F-4 fighter aircraft which were sent to check out a re- Greenewald ported UFO over Tehran. During the encounter, both pursuing F- 4s were apparently \"shut down\" by the UFO, losing all control and all communi- cations. As the F-4' s drifted out of control away from the UFO, and seemed no longer a threat, control was given back to the pi- lots. Many other cases have followed which showed through the government's own documents that the U.S. Government was keeping active files on UFO incidents-and that interest continues to this day. For example. Greenewald's searches have also turned up a very interesting U.S. document which was last revised on Feb. 19, 2004. It is FAA Manual 7110.10.R Flight Services, which says that all UFO reports are to be sent to NORAD. He also discovered Air Force Instruc- tion 10-206, which provides specific in- structions to report UFO sightings to NORAD. In addition, further searches re- vealed that specific Air Force manuals for different aircraft also contain instructions for reporting these \"vital intelligence sightings.\" Greenewald concludes, \"The Black Vault has dealt with top secret military subjects, that span over a half a century, and no subject has received more stone- walling, dead ends, and problems than the UFO question. Why?\" [tetters Wrong base Dear Mr. Connelly, I read with interest the story in June's MUFON Journal by Richard N. Motsinger regarding his experience with a near mid- air collision back in 1950. Mr. Motsinger stated that he was a pas- senger aboard a U.S. Air Force B-25 air- craft which originated at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Houston. This is incorrect. Elmendorf is a PACAF base located in Anchorage, AK, and is still an active installation. The name of the base his flight departed from in 1950 was most likely Ellington Field, located ten miles southeast of Hous- ton. Ellington is no longer an active Air Force base. Today, Ellington Field is home to the Texas Air National Guard's 147th Fighter Wing. —James E. Delehanty, USAF (Ret) Help requested I am a CE-IV analyst (investigator, therapist, counselor) in England, and I have a client who needs some special attention. BUFORA does not have consultants. My client experienced his body being taken apart and put together again using what he was told was a nerve putty. He believes it is still in him, and that it could help those with neurological problems. Is there an anatomist or a neurologist who would be interested in taking a look? Your help would be greatly appreciated. —Karin Hoppe Holloway, CHT, CEA karin.h.h@btintemet.com Correction In the article by Dr. Frederick Alzofon in the July Journal, the reference on p. 9, column 2, under \"Crop circle generation,\" second paragraph, first sentence.should read: \"Ref. 5, p. 64.\" Dr. Alzofon's email address is: f.alzofon@juno.com.

Budinger &NickReiter Background/objective An unusual event reportedly occurred in Alaska within the 1949-1951 time period. A couple, naked and covered in dirt or dust, came to the door of Victoria Jahnke' smother. They asked if they could bathe. Her mom reluc- tantly agreed to this. Before they left, she gave them clothes. When she cleaned out the bathtub, her hands went numb. Nothing she did would help. Sud- denly there was a knock on the door. She found a very tall man standing there who had a tube of salve in his hand. He tore it in half and gave one half to her, telling her that it would take care of the problem with her hands. It did. She saved the remainder of the salve for years, wrapped in a handkerchief. It dried to a pink powder. Victoria gave some of the sample to Bill Jones at the Dearborn MUFON sympo- sium in July, 2003. Bill submitted the sample to me for analysis. Conclusions The salve contains calcium bentonite (60 wt.%), glycerol (glycerine) (30 wt.%), and a mix of long chain mono-, di-, and tri-glycerides (10 wt.%). A small amount of free carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid salt is also present (less than 5 wt.%). The above reported quantitative amounts are very rough estimates, and cer- tainly not representative of the original salve composition, though it is very prob- able that calcium bentonite predominated. More glycerides, which are natural oils, were most likely present. It is suspected Page 12 the glyceride esters originally were in higher amounts to give the salve a grease-like consistency. The glycerides appear to have suffered some deterioration, and probably experi- enced absorption into the handkerchief during the half century since the event. Hence, the salve is now solid. The pres- ence of a long chain carboxylic acid is sus- pected to be degradation product resulting from decomposition of the glycerides, thereby supporting the degradation specu- lation. The carboxylic acid in salt form may be part of the original composition of the salve and associated with lead, i.e. a lead carboxylic acid salt. Perhaps water was initially present. If so, it would have long ago evaporated. The use of calcium bentonite in salve is widely touted as a cure for a wide variety of ailments, including many skin irritations, especially by holistic medicine. The com- position is similar to a commercially avail- able salve, Pasca-Balm Bentonite Oint- ment & Skin Softener. Some history of calcium bentonite is also provided on their website (www.herbakemedies.com). It was known by Native Americans as a healer before the coming of Europeans. The tube container is composed of tin. Metal oxide was detected in the dried salve, but it is highly probable that it is oxidized metal from the tube. Procedure The salve was submitted on the origi- nal, rather decimated, tube remains. In fact, there was nothing resembling a tube left. It appeared to be crinkled metal with a dry coating of material which was more preva- lent on one side. It was difficult to determine which side the salve was on, because it appeared to be smeared on both sides. The shinier side was perceived to be the outside of the tube. The sample was received in a plastic bag. Photographs are included of the front and back of tube fragment with the dry salve coating as submitted. Infrared spectra were obtained of salve scrapings from the tube. A section of the tube with salve was cut into small pieces. These pieces were then extracted with pro- gressively polar solvents, i.e. hexane fol- MUFON UFO Journal lowed by 1:1 acetone: methanol. Infrared spectra were obtained of the extracts and the insolubles. Additionally, the surface of the tube was thoroughly cleaned, and a spectrum obtained from it. Weights of the extracts were obtained in order to determine a rough quantitative es- timation of the amounts. Microscopic photographs were obtained using the Leica GZ6 stereomicroscope in- terfaced to a Kodak Digital Science MDS 120 camera. EDS elemental analysis was done on the salve and a cleaned portion of the tube by Nick Reiter (The Avalon Foundation). Results The results of the individual tests done on the salve and the tube container follow. These results are summarized in the con- clusions section on the first page of this report. Microscope Photographs Microscopic examination of the mate- rial coating the tube shows it is solid. Expectedly, the salve has dried out over the past half century. A microscopic pho- tograph follows. Infrared Analysis Infrared analysis of the salve \"as re- ceived\" shows it is a mixture of compo- nents. Spectral bands suggest calcium ben- tonite and a mixture of long chain mono-, di-, and tri-, glyceride esters. Small amounts of free carboxylic acid and metal oxide are also indicated. Solvent extractions were done to iso- late the materials indicated in the spectrum of \"as received\" salve to better confirm their identifications using infrared spec- troscopy. A very small amount of material was hexane soluble. The infrared spectrum of this extract shows primarily the long chain di-, mono-, and tri- glycerides mixture. Some free car- boxylic acid is also present. Additionally, small amounts of residual, insoluble cal- cium bentonite and metal oxide carry over are detected. There was a moderate amount of 1:1 acetone:methanol soluble material. Infra- red analysis of the extract shows mostly glycerol. A small amount of carboxylic acid salt is indicated.

Schuessler - \"Unconventional Flying Objects: The Body of Technological Evidence.\" It is no longer necessary to refer to UFOs as unidentified. We have amassed evidence to show they are 'unconventional,* rather that \"unidentified.* UFOs are not airplanes, rockets, planets, weather balloons, ball lightning, remnants of comets or meteorites. We know this because a thorough study of the evidence in thousands of UFO cases has eliminated all of these things as explanations. What remains is a reservoir of Unconventional Flying Object reports that defy explanation. Unfortunately, the evidence has been ignored, misrepresented or covered-up for so long that most people accept this as normal. We have the evidence and will discuss it based on the criteria given in McCormick's Handbook of the Law of Evidence. Stephen Bassett - \"Deception, Denial and Disclosure.\" For the past ten years a growing political movement has targeted the politics of UFOs/disdosure. All levels of the media have received extensive materials on the subject Former members of the U.S. military, astronauts and many government employees have been speaking privately and publicly in unambiguous terms regarding the extraterrestrial presence and a government cover-up. Each day the UFO/ET cover-up continues and each new revelation of abuse of power by this or that government agency further erodes the fundamental trust the American people hold in their government - and benchmarks for trust in government are at all time lows. If you truly wish to unite the country and begin an era of cooperation, you must engage an issue of transcendent importance. Grant Cameron - \"Seeking a Checkmate Move: A Search for Conclusive Technological Evidence.\" Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, your duty today is to decide an important case. Your job will be to deckle on the basis of all the evidence I present if there is a case beyond a reasonable doubt that UFOs represent a technological phenomenon, and if it's someone else's advanced technology. Your job win not be an easy one. That is because evidence is treated differently in the UFO world than it is in the world at large. The standards are much higher. Peter B. Davenport - \"Using Muttistatic Passive Radar for Real-time Detection of UFO's in the Near-Earth Environment\" The author proposes a system for the remote, real-time detection of UFO's in the near-Earth environment, using passive, multi-static, frequency-modulated (FM) radar. The system capitalizes on the use of multiple, time-synchronized radio receivers to capture high-frequency radio signals reflected from a target The time-lapse between received signals, together with three-dimensional Doppler-shift analysis, permits calculation of target's location, velocity, acceleration, flight path, and other parameters, possibly to include target size estimation. Signal analysis of the reflected signal, combined with analysis of target characteristics, will permit discrimination between suspected UFO's, and targets of terrestrial origin. One application proposed may allow detection of UFO's to a range of at least 27,600 kilometers from Earth. Deborah Lindemann C.H.T. - \"Signatures of Extraordinary Technology in Abduction.\" As I approach twenty years of investigating UFO encounter cases, I continue to witness the extraordinary signature of abduction, written in the lives of hundreds of people I have worked with. This forensic blueprint shows up in a multitude of ways: physical evidence, unexplained technology, and the profound emotional impact these encounters have upon individuals. Throughout the UFO encounter experience runs a common thread of anomalous experiences and evidence with unworldly implications. This common thread runs through all cultures and ages of people, and between people who have never met I will present the tapestry of the alien signature in several categories, reflected in several important cases including the Romanek case. Budd Hopkins - UFO Abduction Cases: The Medical Evidence.\" Among individuals reporting prior alien UFO abductions, 3 different kinds of physical aftereffects are often found within or upon their bodies: 1. The most common are surface lesions of two types: 'scoop marks,' shallow, depressions, usually found on an abductee's leg, suggesting that layers of tissue have been removed, and fine, straight-line cuts reminiscent of surgical incisions. Both types usually leave lasting scars. 2. Radiological reports of small metallic objects - alleged implants - which occasionally appear in X-rays of abductees' skulls and are inaccessibly located. 3. A wide range of other unusual medical symptoms which occur immediately after an abduction experience and appear to have no acceptable medical causes. These anomalous symptoms include sudden, profuse bleeding from the bladder in males, the absence of a previously existing ovary in females, numerous 'disappearing* pregnancies, and other difficult to explain medical conditions. David Sereda - \"Has NASA Made Contact With Extraterrestrial Intelligence? This is the deepest investigation ever made about break- through footage filmed by NASA. This footage records numbers of disc-shaped objects, ambiguously classified, and until now, unidentifiable. He shows proof of intelligent craft through the process of elimination of other plausible phenomena; fundamental principles of faster-than-light technology & corroborating evidence found on disc-shaped objects; links to the supposed spacecraft and an indentrfiaWe star system. Nick Redfern - \"Flying Triangles' in British Airspace: Evidence of Advanced Technology.\" In 1993, a series of earth-shattering UFO encounters occurred in British airspace that went on to have a profound effect on high-ranking sources within the Royal Air Force and the Ministry of Defense. More importantly, it was that single wave of encounters that convinced British military and defense personnel that the phenomenon was one that demonstrated the presence of advanced, high-performance technology. Some UFOs do indeed display evidence of advanced technology, not built by us, and the Flying Triangle phenomenon is the latest and most significant example of that technology. Ryan Wood - \"Evidence for the Existence of TOP SECRET/MJ-12: A Forensic Examination of Leaked Classified Documents.\" At the heart of the debate of Government complicity in the UFO cover-up at Roswell, and highly credible UFO related activity, is the existence of a blue ribbon panel of military and scientific minds code-named Majestic 12 or MJ-12. For over two decades there have been documents: photocopies, undeveloped film and original papers that detail the story of explicit involvement and extreme government secrecy toward UFOs. Not only are documents in the public domain, but living witnesses also coroborate the documents, the military procedures and the cover-up. Leslie Kean - \"Combating Media Ridicule and Searching for Evidence on the 1965 Kecksburg Crash Case.\" In May 2000,1 published an in-depth story for the Sunday Boston Globe about the French COMET A report and the broader issue of UFOs and national security. My prior experience was as a widely published, print journalist and a producer and host for an investigative news program on KPFA Radio in Berkeley, CA. When I received a copy of the English translation of the COMET A report, I recognized that the extraordinary conclusion reached by the authors was newsworthy, and that this report had potentially profound implications that needed to be made available to the public. Paul Davids - \"Profiles in UFO Courage.' The thesis of this highly visual presentation is the UFO disclosure has been like 'time-release aspirin* - and that the media has been skillfully utilized by a relatively small group of courageous people, who often risked ridicule, as wefl as being targeted for onslaughts of debunking, in order to help the public assimilate the controversial concept that \"We Are Not Alone.* My interest in the UFO field was propelled by a daylight sighting in 1987. It provided the motivation for my becoming executive producer and co- writer of the Showtime film ROSWELL. It also led to my conviction that excessive official secrecy on this issue is a mistaken national policy.

Salve as seen through microscope. nates. The spectrum displays primarily calcium bentonite. There is some metal oxide and organic material which may pos- sibly be carboxylic acid salt. The tube was cleaned, and an infrared spectrum shows it is metal. There is no prominent absorption band. The spectrum shows typical light scattering. The extractions were done quantita- tively. A very rough approximation of the amounts of components are: calcium ben- tonite 60 wt.%, glycerol 25-30 wt.%, and glyceride esters 5-10 wt. % The free car- boxylic acid and carboxylic acid salt are probably present at roughly less than 5 wt.%. Spain plans attack on approaching asteroid in effort to deflect it The European Space Agency has given high priority to a Spanish project which aims to attack an approaching asteroid to see whether spacecraft can deflect a body that may in the future be on a collision course with Earth. Two crafts will set out, one named af- ter the valiant knight of Cervantes' classic tale, Don Quixote, the other after his long- suffering servant, Sancho Panza. Spacecraft Sancho will circle the cho- sen asteroid while the other smashes head- long into the target. The orbiting Sancho and earth-based telescopes will watch closely to see what, if any, effect the impact has on the speed and direction of the asteroid. If all goes to plan, the Quixote mission could launch around 2010. EDS (Elemental) Analysis EDS elemental analysis was done on the tube itself after removing the salve to de- termine the metal it was made from. The EDS spectrum shows tin (Sn). There is a trace of aluminum impurity. EDS was also done on the \"as received\" tube coated with the salve. The major peaks in the spectrum are due to tin from the tube. The remaining elements of carbon, oxy- gen, aluminum, silicon, and probably lead are from the salve. Their presence supports the infrared analysis. Carbon and oxygen are representative of the organic materials (glycerin, glycerol esters, carboxylic acid and carboxylic acid salt), while aluminum and silicon are from the calcium bentonite. The calcium is masked in the spectrum by tin (Sn). The lead may be associated with the carboxylic acid salt in the salve, i.e. its anion. New technique developed for authenticating digital images DARTMOUTH COLLEGE - What's real and what's phony? Seeing is no longer believing. \"Actually,\" says Dartmouth Professor Hany Farid, \"what you see is largely irrel^ evant.\" He is referring to the digital im- ages that appear everywhere: in newspa- pers, on Web sites, in advertising, and in business materials, for example. Farid and Dartmouth graduate student Alin Popescu have developed a mathemati- cal technique to tell the difference between a \"real' ' image and one that's been fiddled with. Consider a photo. of Saddam Hussein shaking hands with Osama bin Laden. Or a photograph of a UFO. Real? The Dartmouth algorithm presented re- cently at the 6th International Workshop on Information Hiding in Toronto, Canada, can determine if someone has manipulated the photos, like blending two photos into one, or adding or taking away objects or people in an image. \"Commercially available software makes it easy to alter digital photos,' ' says Farid, an associate professor of computer science. \"With today's technology, it's not easy to look at an image and decide if it's real or not. We look, however, at the underly- ing code of the image for clues of tamper- ing.\" Farid' s algorithm looks for the evidence inevitably left behind after image tinker- ing. Statistical clues lurk in all digital im- ages, and the ones that have been tampered with contain altered statistics. Farid and his students have built a sta- tistical model that captures the mathemati- cal regularities inherent in natural images. Farid, whose research is funded by an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Depart- ment of Justice, also works with law en- forcement officials, government represen- tatives, and corporate leaders on this issue of authenticating digital images.

We are happy to report that the European Space Agency's orbiting Mars Express craft has tentatively detected ammonia, which can survive for only a short time in the Mar- tian atmosphere. Thus the ammonia must be getting constantly replen- ished by living mi- crobes or plant life. Ammonia is a compound of nitro- gen and hydrogen. Filer Research Institute has previ- ously detected what appears to be _, „., living lichen and George Filer algae on the planet. Linda Howe inter- viewed Professor Vittorio Formi-sano, principal investigator for Planetary Fou- rier Spectrometer, on June 12, and he was expected to release details of new findings at an international conference in Paris. Scientists believe primitive life could survive around hydro-thermal vents near the planet's surface. Many rocks also have patches of lichen, moss, or algae. Australian scientists found evidence that life once existed on Mars in microscopic fossils of primitive bacteria-like organisms in a Mars meteorite which match charac- teristics, of bacteria found in mud in Queensland. The research is published in the Journal of Microscopy. \"The fossils that we have in the mete- orite are the original material-the only dif- ference is that you need a very high-pow- ered electron microscope to image them- to see them-and basically whenever we find these fossils here on Earth, no one ever questions they were made by bacteria,\" he said. \"The only difference is that it was in a meteorite from Mars.\" Methane was also recently found in the Martian atmosphere. Methane is another gas with a possible biological origin. Nitrogen is rare in the Martian environ- ment, but because no form of terrestrial life can exist without it, the presence of am- monia may indicate that Martian micro- bial life is hoarding it. Liquid water on Mars for eons of time JPL also announced this week that sur- face water on Mars existed across a sig- nificant span of time, not just for years but eons of time. The Rover Opportunity re- vealed shortly after landing in January that bodies of liquid water once existed on the surface of Mars. Now the scientists acknowledge that life is likely. We still hold to our position that intelligent life once existed on Mars, and likely still does. Outer space: not so lifeless after all Robert C. Cowen reports, \"Astronomers now think of our galaxy as a vast reactor for biologically significant organic chem- istry.\" Materials that could jump-start or- ganic growth have shown up in interstel- lar dusty planet-forming discs around many stars. These findings fuel an increasingly strong suspicion that the raw material of planet Earth was primed for life. The in- frared-sensing eyes of NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope made the latest discov- ery. As NASA recently announced, Dan Watson and William Forrest at the Uni- versity of Rochester in New York found \"significant amounts of icy organic mate- rials\" around five young stars in Spitzer data. Water, methanol, and carbon diox- ide coat dust particles that were found around the constellation Taurus. Scientists are looking forward to the return in January 2006 of the Stardust spacecraft, which has captured dust from Gomel Wild 2 that may contain organic material. New York flying triangle HUDSON RIVER - The witness was on a boat on the Hudson River and ob- served a very bright light on the northwest horizon on July 3, 2004. The light was re- portedly ten times brighter than Jupiter, so he picked up his binoculars to look at it. It seemed to be stationary for a couple of minutes. \"It started to move toward our location at a very high rate of speed,\" says the witness. \"A jet liner travels through the sky at 600 mph. This object moved at least ten times that speed. It covered the whole visible sky, north to south in about ten sec- onds. \"As it flew over, I was looking at it with binoculars and could see the bottom that was a perfect triangle, with a dim row of lights under each edge.

Portugal military fires at UFO The Portuguese military fired a ground- to-air missile at a luminous UFO that passed over their country during the early morning hours of Monday, June 7, 2004. Portuguese ufologist Gregorio Sao Xavier reported that \"the cigar-shaped UFO was tracked on radar. It moved in a south-to-north direction. It was reported in the Portuguese newspapers that 'a target on radar' was found at three separate mili- tary bases. \"These included Beja, south of Evora and north of the Algarve region; Montijo, near Lisboa; and Oporto, the second larg- est city in Portugal. The news was released by a colonel in the Portuguese Army. \"That same day, only one report came from a civilian identifying the trajectory of the unknown object as coming from north to south, and a cigar form was de- scribed. \"Some days later, it was reported on Spanish and German TV that an official of the Portuguese Army confirmed that a missile had been launched. What most people saw was trailing smoke from the missile launched at the UFO. Visual con- tact with the object was made at the base in Beja.\" Gregorio added, \"A week later, the photo of a cigar-shaped object appeared in a popular (Portuguese) magazine. And a few days later, the military officials charged with the investigation of the inci- dent closed the case, calling it an 'unknown object.'\" One of the most curious aspects of this case was the multiple sightings of a radar- domed AW ACS plane, provided by NATO, which was seen flying offshore, just west of Cabo de Sines, 120 kilome- ters south of Lisboa.

Jan Harzan has done an excellent job of leading the strategic planning process. Under his guidance we updated the Mis- sion Statement and reiterated the goals as follows: MUFON Mission Statement: \"The sci- entific study of UFOs for the benefit of humanity.\" Goal I: Investigate UFO sightings and collect the data in the MUFON Database for use by researchers worldwide. Goal II: Promote research on UFOs to discover the true nature of the phenomenon, with an eye towards scientific break- throughs, and improving life on our planet. Goal HI: Educate the public on the UFO phenomenon and its potential impact on society. Television award, in connec- tion with the annual awards ceremony held in conjunction with the sympo- sium, MUFON presented a new award - \"The 2004 MUFON Excel- lence in Television News Reporting Award.\" As a non-profit organization we depend on volunteers to accom- plish our mission. Their work can be made easier or more difficult de- pending on the quality, of television, radio, and print news reporting. This year's television award went to Kim Posey at FOX News, KDVR Channel 31 in Denver, for her fair, unbiased, and factual cov- erage of the subject at numerous times during the year. New York-based Sanpan Productions presented concepts for \"branding\" MUFON to make it a household name. They will be developing a MUFON cloth- ing line aimed at bringing our message to the public. James Carrion continued to refine the Pandora Project that will eventually con- vert the 35 years of paper files into elec- tronic files that can be used by researchers throughout the world. Tom Whitmore presented a business model for MUFON that will solidify our accomplishments and guide us well into the future. I presented a long list of projects aimed at accomplishing MUFON's goals. Since many of the projects are quite extensive, funding will be required in order to accom- plish the goals in any reasonable time, so the board authorized fund raising initia- tives to make it all happen. The status and content of MUFON's plans will be covered in my future mes- sages and in special articles in the Jour- nal. Position Announcements Kim Shaffer, State Director for East- ern Tennessee, has appointed Melvin C. Redfern to the position of Assistant State Director for Eastern Tennessee. He also holds the position of Research Specialist in Clinical Psychology. Tom Sheets has stepped down from the position of State Director for Georgia.

Webb September 2004 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): There are no bright planets visible in the evening sky this month. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mercury reaches a point 18 degs. W of the Sun on the 9th, making its best morn- ing appearance this year. Using binoculars, one should be able to find the orange ob- ject low in the E at dusk during the first three weeks of the month. Venus (magnitude -4.2) rises in the NE about 2:45 AM in mid-September and as- cends to a nice viewing point in the E by dawn. The brilliant planet is two degrees below much fainter Saturn on the 1st, forms a triangle with Saturn and the crescent Moon on the 10th, passes three degrees SW of the Beehive star cluster on the 13th (en- joy the sight through binoculars!), and closes to within four degrees above the star Regulus on the 30th. Saturn (0.2), in Gemini, rises in the NE about 1:30 AM in mid-month. It isn't far from much brighter Venus. See Venus. Moon Phases: Last quarter—Sept. 6 New moon—Sept. 14 First quarter—Sept. 21 Full moon—Sept. 28 Harvest Moon The Stars: Even though autumn arrives officially Sept. 22, the Summer Triangle maintains its lofty position high in the S during mid- evening hours. The upside-down Flying Horse Pegasus, which includes the Great Square, rises higher in the SE, while Scor- pius disappears in the SW. In the N the Big Dipper descends toward the horizon. Be aware of the following mid-evening bright stars low enough in the heavens to be subject to atmospheric refraction effects and therefore to false UFO reports: Arctu- rus (in the WNW), Antares (WSW), Fomalhaut (SE), and Capella (NE). Crop circle may show Tesla device Western Daily Press, UK - It's the most intriguing crop formation seen in the West for years, and hundreds of sightseers who descended on a wheat field near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, are wondering if it's a coded message. Maybe so. According to experts, the gi- ant circles apparently represent a diagram of an electrical transistor designed 100 years ago by the world's most mysterious inventor. Crop circle experts say it is un- cannily similar to plans for one of Nikola Tesla's early pieces of equipment. Tesla is the unsung hero of pioneering technology, now widely credited with in- venting radio before Marconi and coming up with the idea for remote-control objects. The one discovery he has received credit for is the alternating current which com- peted with Edison's direct current. He also invented the Tesla coil, which can be found in almost all car engines today. But why one of his early diagrams should be recreated in a wheat field near Alton Barnes, the global capital of crop circles, remains a mystery. Michael Soper, a spokesman for Con- tact International, said he was sure it was another message from outer space. He said that while many crop formations were clearly done by dedicated crop artists, some contained messages and were unexplain- able. He said: \"I'm very interested in this one. It's almost as if this is the last piece of a jigsaw which we haven't been able to put together yet, and we're doing it backwards. Tesla is the one major inventor the estab- lishment hasn't recognized, and as a re- sult his work and his impact has remained counter-establishment. \"This clearly shows coils, connectors, and a box with the wires curling out and around it. I've been trying to think about what this means, but it has to be a mes- sage.\" Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal August 2004"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Revelations continue in 1996 Varginha Case as medical witness talks to Dr. Roger Leir By Ubirajara Rodrigues Translated by Eduardo Rado Released by A. J. Gevaerd Published in Brazilian UFO Magazine After eight years from the principal epi- sodes of the Varginha Case, predictions that the volume of information would sub- stantially increase with time are confirmed. However, as with all similar episodes, this volume of information creates problems in determining what is valid, and what is not. We know that facts are proved with witnesses, but the complications arising from human reports turns any investiga- tion into a real challenge. Among the reliable statements-even though depending on analysis grounded on a wider set of data or rare evidence-we should note those from individuals from the area Where the facts supposedly occurred. Military witnesses In 2003, Varginha was visited by Roger Leir, U.S. ufologist and physician, whose experience as a UFO researcher led him to investigate different kinds of occur- rences, such as the cases of implants sup- posedly made by alien surgical interven- tion. This visit was an opportunity to verify the effective existence of some secret wit- nesses of the Varginha Case, which since 1996 was always affirmed by researchers. This was already shown in 1997 when representatives of local and national press were selected to watch-upon ethical com- mitment of absolute secrecy-two video-re- corded interviews with military witnesses who took part in the event. At the same time we may not consider as evidence statements given in secrecy— therefore of restricted or no value. It is cru- cial to prove that these statements really exist. With this objective, Dr. Leir was taken to the office of a colleague, an acknowl- edged doctor in Varginha with more than 30 years of work who belongs to one of the most traditional families of that region. Called by the U.S. ufologist as \"Doc- tor,\" he agreed to receive Dr. Leir, after a natural hesitation, to confirm what he had seen in January, 1996, inside an appropri- ate room at the Regional Hospital, south of Minas Gerais. During more than three hours of talk, August 2004 The three girls who saw and reported the creature are Liliane Silva, 16; Valquiria Silva, 14; and Katia Xavier, 22. (Photo courtesy of Bob Pratt.) Dr. Leir heard from his Brazilian colleague the confirmation that a second creature of uncommon physical appearance was cap- tured. The \"Doctor\" revealed a new detail unknown to researchers untill that time. Injured creature According to the \"Doctor,\" who refuses to reveal his real name, the body presented injuries of different kinds and grades. He said he was urgently called by the military staff responsible for keeping the creature, and described his astonishment in front of something never seen or reported before. His statement regarding the appearance of the creature is not different from many other descriptions of other witnesses, but he said the creature was surely alive when he saw it. This declaration is part of an ever in- creasing group of witnesses, including mili- tary, police officers, doctors, hospital of- ficers, civil witnesses etc. We should not forget, however, the necessity to select the (Continued on page 21) Background on Varginha case A complete discussion of this case was presented by Bob Pratt and Cynthia Luce in the August and September, 1998, issues of \\heJournal. Briefly, the \"Varginha case\" in Brazil, involving the alleged capture of ETs, first came to light after three young women (then 14, 16 and 22 years of age) saw a strange humanoid creature as they were taking a shortcut through a vacant lot at about 3:30 PM on Jan. 20, 1996. Frightened, they reported the incident, and ufologists initiated an investigation. Later, as the investigation unfolded, it was reported that military police (the equiva- lent of state police in the U.S.) had cap- MUFON UFO Journal cured a creature earlier in the day in woods three blocks away from the vacant lot. Then a witness told of seeing armed sol- diers searching the same woods early that afternoon, hearing three shots being fired, and then seeing two body bags (one squirming, one still) being loaded onto an army truck. There were additional reports of more creatures, unexplained carnage at the Varginha zoo, the involvement of hospi- tals and firemen.. There were rumors of an autopsy being performed on a creature. Then, late in 1996, a new witness came forward saying he had seen a UFO crash near Varginha early in January. Page 19"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"^~\"7\"^ .r —-^K-— PERCEPTIONS By Stanton T. Friedman Stan Friedman The way it was back then Many months ago when I was asked to speak at the 57th anniversary of the Roswell Incident Festival in Roswell, NM, I was told that the theme would be the 1940s. So I decided to do a talk entitled \"The Roswell Incident in the Context of the 1940s.\" I thought it would be fun to go over many of the changes that have oc- curred since 1947. In almost all my \"Flying Saucers ARE Real!' or \"Star Travel? YES!\" lectures I am looking forward and always fo- cusing on what I have referred to immodestly as Friedman's Law: \"Techno- logical progress comes from do- ing things dif- ferently in an unpredictable way. The future is NOT an ex- trapolation of the past.\" I thought it would be fun to see how much change there has been in the past 57 years, and try to relate some of the differ- ences to the Roswell Incident as described in- Crash at Corona: The Definitive Study of the Roswell Incident by Don Berliner and myself. (Officially out of print, but autographed copies available from me at FOB 958 Houlton, ME 047390-0958 for $15.)  • ., \"•- : . Some of the obvious changes include no internet, no video, no home or public com- puters, no CD ROMs, no Xerox machines (carbon paper and onion skin paper was used for the Cutler Twining memo, one of the solidest MJ-12 documents), no com- mercial flying on jets, no microwaves, no DVDs, no cassette recorders, and no digi- tal cameras. There were no lasers in hospitals or at supermarket checkout counters-or the myriad of other places where they are used. There were no LP or 45 rpm records, no stereo, no CDs. Local telephone calls required one to ask the operator to get the number. There was no direct dialing of long distance calls either. There were no self-serve gas sta- tions. (Only New Jersey, where I grew up, and Oregon still have none.) Many young men worked at pumping gas, and many women worked as operators for the tele- phone companies. There were no area codes and no zip codes. Many rural areas still had no tele- phones, no electricity, and no mail deliv- ery. Rancher Mac Brazel's son, Bill, had just gotten his first telephone when I lo- cated him in 1979. Mac didn't have a phone or electricity when he discovered the debris field on the Foster Ranch in early July 1947. People have asked me why he didn't just call the Roswell Army Air Force base when he found all that strange stuff out in a pasture. He couldn't. He also didn't have a radio, and hadn't found out about all the noise about flying discs and flying sau- cers that was bruited about prior to his find-or about the reward being offered for wreckage, until visiting the Wade general store, pool hall, bar. and supply center in Corona, NM, on Saturday, July 5, the day before he drove to Roswell to the sheriffs office. Back then some few people had black and white television sets. Network televi- sion didn't come to the fore for several years. News stories went out on one of the wire services, and many papers then called to get more information in the Roswell case from the base, the local newspapers, the local radio station, and the sheriff s office. No CNN or FOX news on the scene. : That is\\why one examines the front page headline stories in.evening papers from Chicago west on July 8, 1947. The story kept growing because of the greater opportunity for more information to be ob- tained because of the different time zones. The Los Angeles Herald Express even had both the \"Crashed Saucer Story\" and \"General Thinks it is Radar Weather Gad- get\" on the same front page. The story was at least five times the size of the original story as it had appeared earlier in the Chi- cago Daily News. \" One interesting thing is that all the sto- ries mentioned that the wreckage was found \"last week,\" thus putting the kibosh on the notion that it was a Mogul Balloon recovered in Mid-June as claimed in the 1994 USAF huge volume \"The Roswell Report: Truth versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert\" by disinformation special- ist Col. Richard Weaver. He did his job and provided the fiction. One silly bit of fiction was the claim by Counterintelligence Corps Officer Sheridan W. Cavitt to Weaver that he re- called the event-just a balloon covering an area 20 feet square and easily fitting in one vehicle. Even the newspaper cover story of July 9, 1947, using information from a reprogrammed Mac Brazel, said it covered an area 200 yards in diameter. Obviously if had been only a single bal- loon, the rancher would have dropped it off at the Sheriffs office, and there would have been no reason for Marcel and Cavitt to make the difficult drive (many miles cross country) to the ranch while follow- ing the rancher. Another major change, though not tech- nological, between now and 1947 was that patriotism was not a dirty word back then. World War II, with it enormous destruc- tion of property and the loss of more than 50 million lives, had ended less than two years earlier; The government was \"The good guys.\" If they lied, as they did with regard to the explosion of the world's first atomic bomb west of Roswell at Trinity site (saying in a press release that it was just an ammuni- tion dump that had blown up, nobody in- jured), it was for a very good reason. People active in the war served their government regardless of whether they were Republicans or Democrats. MJ-12 member Sydney Souers, who had been the first director of Central Intelligence, and was asked by Truman (a Democrat) to be the first executive secretary of the National Security Council, kept an office at the White House after he went back to his busi- ness in Missouri in 1950, and served on Ike's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board as late as 1956, though Dee was a Repub- lican. Gen. James H. Doolittle, though a V.P. of Shell Oil after the war, had a contract with Shell that said he could spend up to half his time on government business, and was asked by Ike to perform a number of important, and usually classified, chores.

People have asked me why various mili- tary personnel involved in the Roswell saga didn't object to lying and following orders. Especially after WW II, and considering that Col. Blanchard (base commander at Roswell and head of the most elite mili- tary group in the world-The 509th com- posite bomb group), Gen. Ramey (head of the 8th Air Force and Blanchard's boss), Gen. Clements McMullen (acting head of the Strategic Air Command and Ramey's boss), and (then) Col. Thomas Jefferson DuBose (Ramey's chief of staff) were all West Pointers, following orders was what officers did Racial segregation was legal, with sepa- rate (supposedly equal) schools, housing, restrooms, buses etc. One objection to sto- ries told by Gerald Anderson and Glenn Dennis about a nasty red-haired officer and a black sergeant was that the army wasn't officially desegregated until 1948. These attacks ignore the fact that blacks were allowed to handle dog secu- rity patrols. Interracial marriages were il- legal in most places. As was abortion, lead- ing to many back alley abortions with many women losing their lives. There was no oral contraceptive pill. There was no Viagra. There was no space program, no satellites, and no nuclear sub- marines that could go around the world underwater. Space was the domain of comic book characters like Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. Almost all of the news coverage about flying saucers was framed in terms of pos- sible secret government programs by us or the Russians. After all, the development of nuclear weapons was done in secret, why not flying saucers? ET was not a designa- tion in common usage. Ironically, a very surprising event on June 29, 2004, brought home to me four other technological marvels that didn't exist in 1947. I was driving from my home in Fredericton, New Brunswick, to Bangor, ME, 195 miles away, where I intended to spend the night before catching flights to Boston, Cincinnati and Albuquerque, and then to drive the last 200 miles to Roswell for the festival. At about 3:30 PM, 14 miles north of Bangor on 1-95.1 apparently fell asleep- too much lunch, and no coffee or cigars on the way-and flipped my 1996 Toyota Co- rolla, with it flying about 30 feet and land- ing in the woods off the road on the roof. The air bag went off, the seat and shoul- der belts held, and I walked away with a few small bruises after appropriate con- versations with emergency personnel and some good Samaritans. The car was a to- tal loss. Needless to say, I smoked two cigars and drank three cups of coffee on the way from Albuquerque to Roswell-and on the return journey days later. In 1947, there not only were no interstate highways, but there were no air bags, no seat belts, and no Toyotas. I guess somebody up there was looking after me, and wanted me to speak in Roswell, to attend the subsequent MUFON conference in Denver, and to write another column.

(Continued from page 19) gathered information, which sometimes may receive the direct influence of the in- vestigator. Here is one example especially chosen to emphasize the neutrality of arguments, so important for the discussion of UFO or similar occurrences. One of the procedures preferred by ufologists of the so-called objective line- not mystical-is to focus their attention to statements free of personal impressions, especially those where witnesses talk about their own emotional alteration at the mo- ment of their experience. The \"Doctor,\"initially insisting that it was a colleague who was called by the military to the referred hospital, eventu- ally admitted that he was the doctor in question, and decided to trust his US col- league, Dr. Leir, telling everything. The \"Doctor\" was touched, and giving us a new detail about the case. With a se- rious expression on his face he said that when he was trying to examine the inju- ries of the being he felt suddenly \"as if my hands were automatically driven,\" and \"it was as if the lights suddenly became yel- lowish,\" and \"my perception was some- what enhanced.\" These are transcriptions of what he said. The \"Doctor\" also said that he could not understand the physiological constitu- tion of the body he was examining, even though it was an anthropomorphic being, with head, trunk, and members. The \"Doctor\" did not hear any sound made by the creature, nor did he mentionn the famous \"thin, bifurcated tongue\" re- ported by other medical and military wit- nesses. He said he had seen its slow move- ments, proving it was still alive, but re- fused to say if it was breathing. Here is the example of the difficulties found in statements like this. We don't know to which extent the psychological impact and emotional alterations of a pro- fessional before the unknown would influ- ence him to the point of causing uncom- mon sensations. For obvious reasons, such alterations may occur much more in persons with tech- nical knowledge and refined culture. The contact with a situation not explicable by academic assumptions means increased sensitivity to such shocks. Therefore, the reported impressions could be a simple re- sult of this. It would be absurd to take the detail of a supposedly psychic interaction between the creature and the doctor as an effective signal of intelligence of the being, or, even more absurd, that the \"Doctor\" was in con- tact with something with telepathic or simi- lar powers. These kinds of assertions, how- ever, are not uncommon. Complications in the research With time, hopes of new information and other confirmations about the Varginha Case are partially satisfied. But there is the risk that they come each time more characterized by complications. For now, the most significant of these complications is the denial of the institu- tions involved from the beginning, such as the Army, hospitals, and others. Even if we had access to a detailed re- port composed of examinations, analyses, and full data about the material resulting from the episode, the effective existence of the said creatures of Varginha could only be confirmed if officially admitted. While this does not happen, ufologists, researchers, skeptics, and curious and in- terested people can only keep on the fur- ther discussion about the case.

Fowler, iUniverse, Inc., 2004,6x9 soft cover, 260 pages. $20.95. (Available personally signed and postpaid for $25.00 ($30 Canada) from Fowler at 249 Maguire Road, Kennebunk, ME 04043.) Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Ray Fowler has been one of the top UFO researchers over the past sev- eral years, having written ten books and many magazine articles on the sub- ject. He has appeared on numerous radio and TV shows, and has been a consult- ant to film docu- mentaries and Time-Life books. Fowler had a daylight sighting of a disc in 1947, and began researching the topic. In 1963 he took the plunge into formally investigating the phenomenon, and soon became a well-known and respected mem- ber of the UFO community. While he has investigated numerous cases over the years, his best known are the Allagash abduction, involving four young men taken from a canoe, and his ex- tensive work with Betty Andreasson Luca. Both of these cases resulted in books- multiple books, in fact, in the Andreasson case. Ray has evolved in his thinking from a \"nuts and bolts\" approach to, as the title of this latest book indicates, an acceptance of \"synchronicity and other strange phe- nomena.\" This evolution was also dealt with in his previous book, UFO Testament- Anatomy of an Abductee* as he docu- mented the process of the investigator gradually becoming the subject of his own investigations. Thus Ray has determined that he, like the subjects of his books, is an abductee-complete with a suspected im- plant. This latest book, based in part on a ten- year diary and a study of Jungian psychol- ogy, continues the exploration of his life experiences, and these revelations are es- pecially significant in view of his stature in the UFO community. It will be somewhat surprising for many people to see a hard-nosed, no nonsense ufologist become involved with the Near Death Experience (NDE) and out-of-body experiences. While some well-known investigators, such as Dr. J. Allen Hynek, have privately speculated well beyond the \"nuts and bolts\" of ufology, Ray has publicly \"come out of the closet\" in a big way in his two most recent books. This has been a broadening experience for him, and one he embraces, but also one that has not been without its downside-in- cluding strained relationships with formal religion, and even with his own family. Thus this book is about Ray's life, as well as about synchronicity (which the Journal of Religious Thought defines as \"a meaningful coincidence of two or more events, where something other than the probability of chance is involved\"). For Fowler, synchronicity is tied in with numinosity, which he describes as the \"emotional glow or fascination or power that an activated archetype inspires in the inner experiences it gathers to itself.\" His first major encounter with numinosity came in 1950 when, as a teen- ager, he experienced a brilliant beam of light from the sky which coincided with a religious conversion experience. This \"born again\" episode created \"a rapturous feeling of unconditional love and the now recognized tingling sensation associated with my anomalous experiences.\" He adds, \"Whatever/Whoever it was- God, UFO entities, or Other-I felt that the numinosity of this experience was not self- caused. I was thoroughly convinced that it was generated by a power from outside myself.\" Earlier, at the age of 8, he had experi- enced a bright light shining into his bed- room on several occasions. Instead of be- ing frightened, he had crawled out of bed and allowed the light to shine on him, ex- periencing what he describes as \"pure love.\" On one occasion, however, the light was accompanied by a robed woman, who also vibrated love. He felt he was then trans- ported from the room by the light, then re- turned. Although the memory of this event began to slip away, Ray still associates a name with the experience: Amelia Earhart. Since then, he has recorded numerous instances of what he feels are synchronisms involving the name of this famous aviator who had disappeared over the Pacific Ocean and was presumed dead. Much of this book is a documentation of what Ray feels are synchronistic expe- riences. Some of these the reader might mark down as the type of coincidences we all experience, but taken as a whole they do suggest more than this. Also included are date-by-date incidents of blood on Ray's pillow, as well as other evidence indicating some sort of recurring abduction experiences. He also discusses, for example, the pos- sible significance of his glancing at clocks and seeing such times as 3:33,2:22, or 4:44 in conjunction with other phenomena, such as special sounds, a tingling sensation, and possible abductions. Ray indicates that he has found \"re- markable similarities\" between Near Death Experiences (NDEs) and the UFO experiences, adding that \"they appear to be the same phenomenon experienced un- der different circumstances.\" Ray also dis- cusses where contact with the dead fits into this general scenario. Unfortunately, there is not room in this review to delve further into these issues, but those interested will find this part of Ray's book especially worth reading. Keep in mind that there is much more \"meat\" in this book than in this brief re- view, which cannot do it justice. Where does Ray go from here? While admitting that his experiences are beyond his understanding, he says that his interest in exploring synchronicity's relationship with clairvoyance, pre-cognition, religious experiences, and telepathy has deepened. hi the meantime, Ray feels that synchro- nistic phenomena \"leave me with a com- forting feeling that I am in the right place at the right time, doing exactly what I am supposed to be doing. They leave me with a strong impression that everything in cre- ation is, and has been, connected from its beginning.\" Page 22 MUFON UFO Journal August 2004"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"For advertising, contact John Schuessler, schuessler@mho.net, 303-948-6224.

Those data (right) are shown next to a corresponding picture of the rings taken by Cassini's narrow angle camera. (Credit: NASA/JPLAJniversity of Arizona) Cassini finds data in Saturn's rings Just a few days after the Cassini space- craft entered Saturn orbit, preliminary sci- ence results are already beginning to show a complex and fascinating planetary sys- tem. One early result intriguing scientists concerns Saturn's Cassini Division, the large gap between the A and B rings. While Saturn's rings are almost exclusively com- posed of water ice, new findings show the Cassini Division contains relatively more \"dirt\" than ice. Further, the particles between the rings seem remarkably similar to the dark mate- rial that scientists saw on Saturn's moon, Phoebe. These dark particles refuel the theory that the rings might be the remnants of a moon. The F ring was also found to contain more dirt. Saturn's rings are thought to be made up of boulder-size snowballs. Another instrument on Cassini has de- tected large quantities of oxygen at the edge of the rings. Scientists are still trying to understand these results, but they think the oxygen may be left over from a collision with the main rings that occurred as re- cently as January of this year. Cassini's examination of Saturn's at- mosphere began while the spacecraft was still approaching the planet. Winds on Sat- urn near the equator decrease dramatically with altitude above the cloud tops. Cassini has also imaged Saturn's larg- est moon Titan, which is thought to harbor simple organic compounds that may be important in understanding the chemical building blocks that led to life on Earth. Although too cold to support life now, Ti- tan serves as a frozen vault to see what early Earth might have been like. 24 MUFON UFO Journal August 2004"}]
