It is with extreme pleasure that we an- nounce the selection of our twenty-first Consultant. George E. Kocher, M.S. has volunteered to serve not only as a Consultant in Astronomy, but also as the State-Section Director for the Illinois counties of Jas- per, Crawford, Richland and Lawrence. George achieved nation-wide recog- nition in the UFO field as the author of \"The Rand Report,\" a document he originally prepared for engineering and research personnel with the Rand Corporation. The document is divided into five parts, all dealing with UFO's: (1) Historical Aspects, (2) Phenomenological Aspects, (3)The Character of Reports, (4) Astronomical Aspects, and (5) How to Proceed and Why. Mr. Kocher now resides at R. R. 3, Oblong, 111., 62049 with his family, listing his present occupation as farmer. Francis L. Ridge, 221 Main, Hillsboro, 111., 62049 has joined MUFON at the State-Section Director for Montgomery, Macoupin and Fayette Count- ies in Illinois. \"Fran\" is the Manager of the P. N. Hirsch & Co. depart- ment store in Hillsboro. He has been recording, mapping and researching UFO reports for the past thirteen years in the midwestern States. Robert W. Baughraan, Ph.D., presently a Consultant in Bacteriology, has also accepted the dual role of State-Section Director for the Iowa counties of Story and Boone, replacing Dr. Emerson Shiedler who has moved to Boulder, Colorado. Dr. Baughman conducted soil tests on samples taken from the damaged soybean fields in northern Iowa and performed analysis on hair samples found in the Louisiana,'Mo., area this past summer in his private laboratory. Individuals joining MUFON during November and December of 1972 have received receipts for their 1973 membership dues and identification cards. The small annual memership dues of $2.00 is used to help defray the administrative costs of MUFON for items such as stationery, postage, mailing envelopes, report forms, brochures etc. Since the dues apply to the calendar year, Fields F. Freeman MUFON Treasurer, is reminding members wo submit their checks or money orders made payable to the \"Midwest UFO Network, Inc.\" at this time to MUFON, 40 Christopher Court, Quincy, 111. 62301. Fields would like to express his appreciation for your generous consideration. The Board of Directors of MUFON wish each and everyone a Happy New Year and seek your continued loyalty and support in 1973. Signed: \"Walt\" ; Walt Andrus Director, MUFON Just In—Joseph M. Brill, MUFON Field Investigator and staff member of SKYLOOK, of Franklin Perk. 111., will speak on his specialized research in \"UFO's Behind the Iron Curtain\" at the First United Presbyterian Church at 24th & Monroe Streets in Quincy, 111. at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 21st.

Coming in SKYLOOK—an article on the \"Rand Report\" (see MESSAGE above) more fine articles by Klinn and Branch re their research into \"secret\" UFO reports, and other UFO reports we don't have room for in this issue. From Ye Ed and Staff—our best wishes for you in 1973."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Despite Denials. Secret UFO Documents Do Exist Editor's Note: The above is a six-column headline over another article by Robert B. Klinn and David Branch, in the Oct. 4, 1972 issue of \"The Register,\" Santa Ana, California. Again, we thank Prof. Charles G. Kahlert who is sending us the articles. We wish space permitted using them in their entirety—and we suggest you write the newspaper to request back issues* Whatever their charge, it's worth it. Our own necessarily condensed adapt- ation of this particular article follows: \"Existence of a Top Secret U. S. Air Force report which concluded that un- identified flying objects are interplanetary spaceships has been confirmed by the former chief UFO project scientist for the Air Force, Dr. J. Allen Hynek. The Air Force has repeatedly denied existence of the document,\" the article begins* The writers state that Dr. Hynek told them he read the Top Secret \"Esti- mate of the Situation\" which was prepared in 1943 by air intelligence anal- ysts at the Air tecnnical Intelligence Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. It was sent to the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg* Controversy about the document has raged since 1956. Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, former Air Force UFO project chief, discusses it in his book \"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects.\" He says: \"It was a rather thick document with a black cover and it was printed on legal-sized paper. Stamped across the front were the words TOP SECRET.\" The ATIC estimate was that UFOs were interplanetary, he said. As early as 1953 Major Donald E. Keyhoe, retired Marine c orps officer and then director of the Civilian National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, said the Air Force was hiding the document and called this to the attention of the public. His investigations, he said, also revealed that, in addition to the 194# report, at least three others re- lated to UFOs were being withheld by the Air Force. In an interview by Mike Wallace on ABC television, March £, 1953, Wal- lace challenged Keyhoe in telling him he (Wallace) had spoken to the Air Technical Intelligence Center at the Pentagon earlier in the week and was told officially by them: \"Three of the four documents Major Keyhoe refers to (the 1947, 194$ and 1952) simply do not exist.\" However—in January 1969 the 1947 document was made public—22 years after it was written. It is a revealing, official letter from General Nathan F. Twining to the commanding general, Army Air Forces. It appears as an appendix in the Condon Report* The existence of the 1952 analysis was verified in a statement released in 1964 (The UFO Evidence, NICAP) and reconfirmed to the writers in 1971 by the officer who had directed the study, former Major Dewey J. Fournet. But the report remains unreleased. The original 1953 CIA report also remains classified, the writers ,continue, although increasingly complete versions have been released. And now J. Allen Hynek has confirmed existence of the 1946 TOP SECRET \"Estimate.\" It is still unreleased. In the Oct. 11, 1972 issue of \"The Register,\" Klinn and Branch take up the official letter dated Sept. 23, 1947 and signed by General Nathan F. Twining, released as an obscure appendix in the \"Scientific Study of Un- identified Flying Objects\" better known as the Condon Report. Buried on page 677, the letter has been completely overlooked by the press in its coverage of Condon findings, the writers point out. Pertinent excerpts follow: \"23 September 1947 \"SUBJECT: AMC (Air Material Command) Opinion concerning 'Flying Discs 1"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"TO: Commanding General Army Air Forces Washington, 25, D.

This opinion is based on interrogation report data durnished by AC-AS-2 and preliminary studies by personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, Engin- eering Division T-3. This opinion was arrived at in a conference between personnel from the Air Institute of Technology, Intelligence T-2, Office, Chief of Engineering Division and the Aircraft Power Plant and Propeller Laboratories of Engineering Division T-3. \"2.

The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll) and action which must be consid- ered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the objects are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely, e. The apparent common description of the objects is as follows: * * * « / here are listed the usual descriptions of the most common types./ The letter closed with the following \"It is recommended that: a* Head- quarters, Army Air Forces issue a directive assigning a priority, security classification and Code Name for a detailed study of this matter. . .\" and was signed by General Twining. As the letter recommended, a study was sunsequently conducted called Project Sign. A year later it was ostensibly closed, ^ut only later did the public learn that in 1949 the project had been continued secretly under another name, Project Grudge, On D ec. 17, 19o9, the Air Force closed Project Blue Book. Air Fore* spokesmen now say, \"We're out of the UFO business.\" Klinn and Branch ask, \"But is it reasonable to believe that the Air Force is ignoring increasing reports of low-level UFO activity across the country? Will it be another 22 years before documents pertaining to cur- rent investigations and conclusions are released?\" More Next Month The Constellations. Lepus (The Hare) The origin of the name Lepus is hidden in doubt and speculation.Lepus is Latin for \"the hare\" but none of the more ancient civilizations pictured a hare in this part of the sky. Lepus was variously known as a serpent, a boat and a chair. Lepus is a very small constellation directly below Orion. It culminates at 9 p.m. on January 28. There are four fairly bright stars in Lepus. Alpha Leporis (Arneb) is almost in the center of the constellation. Arneb is Arabic for \"the hare\"—on the western border is R Leporis, a variable star known also as Hind's crimson star. The magnitude varies from 6 to 10.4 and back in 430 days. It is deep red and the color indicates that it is fairly cool. Spectroscopic analysis indicates that it is inside a dense cloud of gas through which it sends its own brilliance with difficulty.

The object had the shape'of \"an inverted dishpan or cake tin,\" with the open, or larger section, facing downward. It had a very distinct outline as shown in her sketch, and was red or orange in color with a silver stripe running parallel through the center. There were two projections on the bottom and she thought she glimpsed a window on the front side. \"I never saw anything like this on earth,\" she told the Kirksville \"Daily Express\" and also Walter H, Andrus, Director of MUFON, who inter- viewed her at length. After hovering over the intersection for possibly 30 seconds (the entire observation was estimated at 90 seconds) with the object occupying nearly the entire area of the windshield as viewed by Mrs. Myers, it started moving in an upward slant to the south from which it had first appeared. It slowly accelerated in speed and passed into the heavy overcast to the south and was no longer seen. There had been no sound and no KM effects on the car (the car radio was not enduring the observation) and there were no ill effects from viewing the self-luminous object. On returning to Kirksville, Mrs. Myers went to the \"Daily Express\" to report the sighting and to ask if anyone else had seen the object. At last check, no one else had reported doing so. The newspaper printed an account of her report on Nov. 22nd. Mr. Andrus writes: \"Since the sunrise was scheduled for 7:03 a.m. CST on Nov. 22, I questioned Mrs* Myers extensively on this point. The sun rises in the southeast at this particular time of the year. She was very insistent that this red object c&me from directly south, and it definitely was not the sun.

The sky remained overcast until 1:00 p.m. The sun would have difficulty giving the appear- ance of moving up to the highway, hovering and then retracing its path back to the south* Mrs. Myers had observed her wrist watch and noted that it was 7:15 a.m. as she sat watching the object through the front wind- shield of the 1973 Pontiac. When it was hovering, she aaid it occupied nearly the entire area of the windshield as viewed from the driver's seat. With a 1500 ft. overcast, the object was definitely at close range. She was unable to estimate the altitude of the object.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"A Report from Argentina * . . Translation by Dr. and Mrs. Willard Armstrong From CIDOANI (Informative Bulletin) Vol. VI, January 1972. Official Pub- lication of Centro Investigador de Objectos Aereos No Identlficadoe (Inves- tigating Center for Unidentified Flying Objects) Cespedes 3422, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Editorial A day like any other. A little known place, almost uninhabited, whose only signs of life are some isolated houses and a field partially cultivated* Two farmers, one is almost a boy. This is the scene which we enter in 1971. Suddenly: the unexpected. That day now is distinguished, that place is singled out. . It is that those farmers say they have seen \"something 11 and they have broken into print; but basically the truth of those affirm- ations doesn't seem to matter much: because now the expected coming of the UFOs has been given space in big headlines. Later doubts arise, and the investigation and all expectations are dimmed with the passage of time. More than thirty reports of UFOsfin 1971) in our country made up the activity of the phenomenon, which supposedly has occurred so sparingly in the rest of the world. Only two thirds of the observations were re- ported previously in the written press; the remainder was due to the regular reception of reports by CIDOANI. January and in particular May seem to be months in which these phenomena have occurred most frequently during the course of 1971, the great majority presenting themselves, as is common, in the night hours and singly—Buenos Aires and Santa .Fe, in that order, have been the provinces most frequented in their appearance by the ever-present UFOs. Nevertheless, due to the discouraging aspect which that year might pre- sent to us, it is worth pointing out that the \"Argentine Information Net\" (Red Argentina de Informacion or RAI) for UFOs is in process of formation, which as we will recall had its inception more than a year ago, when CIDOANI celebrated in Buenos Aires the \"Second National Symposium of UFO Investigations\" (from which comes the importance of these meetings) and since then, during all of 1971, the UFO Department of the Center of Phy- sical Studies (CES) of Santa Fe. together with the central organizer of the meetings.CIDOANI of Buenos Aires, to which then was joined the Ar- gentine Circle of Ufological Investigations (CADIU), of Cordoba, have taken charge of organizing the aforesaid Net, first in the world, which places at the disposition of the investigators the cases which occur in the country, in quick, concise form and with scientific criteria. The success of the RAI will be in the last analysis the success of the investigation. THE ARGENTINE UFO INFORMATION NET On October 29, 30 and 31, 1970, there was celebrated in Buenos Aires the second national symposium of UFO investigations, sponsored by the Investigating Center for UFOs (CIDOANI). In Point 10 of the conclusiona which were prepared in the aforesaid symposium was expressed the necessity of holding soon a meeting which might prepare the basis formation of a central body, for the purpose of collecting and coordinating UFO investi- gations at the national level. Accordingly, two private groups, the aforementioned CIDOANI of Buenos Aires, and the Center for Physical Studies (CEF), of Santa Fe, by means of its UFO Department, took charge of the organization of an Argentine"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Information Net, which without doubt constitutes a unique and trans- cendental step for the unified scientific study of the UFO in the Ar- gentine Republic. The net will be a decentralized organization of national character* The Argentine territory has been divided into six regions according to characteristics of topography, routes of communication, density of pop- ulation distribution of the principal affiliated investigators, and zones of surveillance. / Long list of regions follow\"77 In each region a group fulfills the function of regional coordinator of information, and the remaining associated groups act Jointly with it. / Prodedure notes follow77 Among the advantages of the net, are evident the following: (a) The collection of the most complete information covering cases which happen anywhere in the country* (b) The elimination of sensationalism and dis- tortion of the facts, (c) That each affiliated investigator will have available a complete, quickly accessible archive for the study of part- icular aspects of the phenomenon. In order to classify and organize the information there will be dis- tributed a guide which indicates clearly how to edit the reports. The latter will be of three types: \"A n - Technical report on an observation of a UFO; \"B n - Technical report on a contact with beings, and \"C n - Technical report on the detection of a UFO with radar. Editor's Note: Our thanks to the Armstrongs for the translation. It is interesting to know that other countries are aware of the UFO phenomenon and are organizing to investigate sightings. Just as interesting is their apparent lack of information as to what is happening outside their own area. They seem to consider their \"more than 30 UFO reports in 1971\"' as leading the world as they speak of sightings \"so sparingly in the rest of the world 11 and regard their new network as unique. It would seem they never heard of APRO or NICAP and both have been around a long time, reporting UFO sightings all over the world, and we believe each has rep- resentatives in Argentina. Then there is England's \"Flying ^aucer Review 11 probably as well known; other foreign publications—and back to the States, many good magazines devoted to reporting UFOs and having overseas sub- scribers. Just recently the National Enquirer published a report on UFO Sightings in Argentina, written by their reporter Bill Burt, who went to Argentina. He was told that approximately 1,800 reports of UFO sight- ings have been investigated in Argentina in recent years and that between 250 and 300 reports are \"genuine evidence of unexplained visits from somwhere beyond the earth.* 1 This statement was made by Captain Omar Pagan!, official UFO investigator for the Argentine navy and a former naval in- telligence officer who now is a senior government official. Of course, the above article was written nearly a year ago. Perhaps their \"iron curtain\" is lifting now. *e hope so. * The January Sky.

It was about 6:45 am and just beginning to get light. There was no fog and visibility was good. As Mr. I approached the area of the Penn Joint High School football field practice area, he noticed something un- usual resting on the uncut grass field between the field itself and the road he was on. *he object was about a quarter of a mile distant. He stopped his car to take a better look. His first impression was that the object was some type of float as used in a parade; but he soon changed his mind. He described the pbject as an oblong, triangular-shaped object with a pyramid-shaped dome. A 'he overall length of the craft was that of three or four cars, estimated to be from 40 to 60 feet. From the bottom to where the dome began was about 5 feet, and the height of the dome was between six to eight feet. ^he entire craft was self luminescent and did not reflect on the ground The object wss a flourescent orange color with the triangular body duller than the rest. The pyramid dome was divided in half—possibly two separate windows, or an opening. The right side was a very bright floures- cent orange and the other side a duller reddish-orange color. n e compared it to \"an object covered with canvas fla ring out at the bottom.\" It didn't have a metal-like appearance, he said, but seemed more like plastic. After viewing the object a short time, the observer became somewhat alarmed and decided to leave in a hurry. H e heard no sound during the time he looked at the object and the light did not bother his eyes. The next day he went back to the area and saw nothing unusual. Although he had previously taken that route to work every morning, he now refuses to drive alone on that road. He gave every indication of being level-headed and sincere in making his report. Members of the Westmoreland Bounty UFO Study \"roup searched the area and found nothing unusual. They interviewed several residents of the immediate area, but found no one who had any knowledge of the incident. They noted the angle of the \"landing area\" was such that the craft could actually have been hovering just above ground, altho it appeared from the road the object was on the ground. Stan Gordon, Director of the group and our MUFON representative in thet area, adds :\"The area where the sighting occurred is the main UFO flap area in the county. It is a desolate area with major 500 KV power transmission lines strung all around. These lines go to the large Fort Martin Power Plant at Morgantown, W. Va. This area over the years has produced dozens of UFO sightings of which many were low level observa- tions.\" Another Report from Pennsylvania On a tip from Bob Schmidt, an officer of the UFO Resesrch Institute of Pittsburgh, Stan Gordon, Bob McCurry and George Lutz, all of the study group mentioned in the preceding article, investigated a sighting which occurred at 5 a.m., w ov. 7, at Irwin, Pa. Mr. and Mrs. \"Smith* and family live in a new housing development near Irwin, several miles from Route 30 West. Mr. Smith is an executive in branch firm out of Pittsburgh. At about 5 a.m. Mrs. Smith went to her daughter's bedroom to check on her and happened to glance out of the window. She saw an object over the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"trees to the northeast and stood watching it for several moments, after which it began to move rapidly toward their home and stopped directly over their neighbors 1 house across the street. When the object was first seen, it was a quarter of a mile distant, fchen over the house, it appeared to be about the size of baseball, though oval-shaped and seemed to have a ring around it (as a Saturn ring)• The object then began to ascend higher into the sky and seemed to be moving in a wobbly manner, and was spinning from right to left. A he object was extremely bright and a bright gold in color, *he light did not reflect on the black sky. At one point, Mrs. Smith thought she saw a beam of light appear from the center of the base of the object and extend at an angle to the left. Mrs. Smith decided to call her husband and he watched the object for about twenty minutes, then returned to bed as he had to be up early to leave for work. Mrs* Smith continued to watch until about 6:30 a.m. when light began to appear, fcven though the bright stars were disappear- ing from view, the gold object could still be recognized at high alti- tude* When the object was first observed, the witnesses stated they heard a sound which was similar to \"traffic in the distance.\" Their house is located a distance from any highways and there is little traffic at the early hour. Mrs. Smith noted their house was the only residence on the street with lights on. No interference of any type was noticed. Mrs. Smith did comment to her husband while they were watching the object that she thought she might be getting the flu since she felt very warm. x his was possibly due to her excitement. They discussed reporting the sighting to the police, but decided against it because they had heard of others who had done so and were ridiculed. They consented to an interview on the condition their names be withheld in any report made. Light \"Explodes\" Over Pennsylvania Home July 14, 1972, was hot and sultry and Mr. and Mrs. \"Jones\" ; (names on file) decided to sleep in their living room where a large fan afforded some relief from the heat. Mrs. Jones was on a sofa next to a screened window when something bright in the sky caught her eye just past midnight. The bright object moved from the southwest to the northeast over a tall pine tree in a neighbor's yard. Thinking at first it was a falling star, Mrs. Jones continued to watch. In a few minutes the object re- turned, retracing its original path and \"it was weird and frightening.\" 1 At this point Mrs. Jones attempted to awaken her husband, sound asleep on the floor, but he did not rouse and she turned her attention to the window. The object looked like \"a fiery orange elipse\" about the size of a football, she said. As it floated over the pine tree again, a yellow-orangish flame jetted from one end. It moved slowly and sound- lessly until it reached a point above their garage.

Ill, Steve Garner, of Beckemeyer, 111., is greatly interested in UFOs and has the habit of keeping an eye on the sky, hoping to see a UFO* At S:30 p.m. on Sept. 23, 1972 he got his wish. He said the weather was foggy, rainy and cloudy\" but he was still observing the sky as usual while outdoors, and he saw a bright, white light which he thought must be a star, in spite of the weather condition. At second look he decided the light was too large and too near the ground to be a star. \"It was bigger than a street light and moved faster than anything I ever saw,\" he told Mae Jannett, of Beckemeyer. \"It was all lit up and dancing in the sky, \"he added.

Illinois Farmer Reports Object Outlined in Blue Light Edward Hagerbeumer, a farmer, Route 1, Lorraine, 111., saw an unusual object the night of October 14, 1972, and a report was turned in to Walter H. Andrus, MUFON Director. Mr* Hagerbaumer, 64, was driving his tractor along a side road on the way to assist a neighbor with crop harvesting. It was 9 p.m. and the sky was clear with a bright moon shining* He was on bottom land along a creek that flows into Bear Creek* As he looked to the southeast over the bottoms he observed a very unusual light at about tree top level. He saw a dark object about the size of a door, he said, but narrower at the top instead of being a perfect rectangle, and it was outlined In a blue light which he compared to blue Christmas tree lights* The light, which appeared suddenly, glowed for about 30 seconds, then just as suddenly switched off* The farmer continued on down the road and in 4-5 minutes the object, outlined in blue light, suddenly appeared again, then \"switched\" off in about 15 seconds and was seen no more. He did not stop his tractor, which functioned normally, and he didn't hear any other sound or notice anything else unusual. His neighbor, Otis Corrigan, also working in the area, did not see the light. Texas Women Frightened by Bright Sky Ob.lects Miss \"Jones\" and Miss \"Smith\" (real names on file) were on their way to the former's place of employment in Dallas, Texas, on Oct. 12, 1972, and had an experience which left them nervous and frightened. The time was 10:50 p.m. (Miss Jones is on a night shift) and the night was warm and calm. The moon had set and the sky was slightly overcast. Miss Jones suddenly saw a strange light approaching from the north and leaned from the open window on the right to get a better view* Miss Smith was driving* Miss Jones described the light as a brilliant white, much brighter and larger than a police helicopter strobe light. As it came closer, blinking red and green lights could be seen. She could not make out the shape of the object because of the extreme brightness of the white light. The object followed the car for some distance, then hovered and the red and green lights blinked off. At this point, a smaller object* also a brilliant white, dropped from the larger object. The large object then made a sharp U-turn to the south, rapidly gained altitude and disappeared. The small object hovered for a few seconds, then followed the same flight path of the other and was soon out of sight. Credit: Earl F.

She was within a mile of Patoka when there was a sudden flash in the sky* At first Mrs. Bricker thought the flash was a falling star, but then she saw it was moving rapidly in a zigzag fashion from west to east and she slowed her car to watch. When seen at its best appearance, the object seemed to be a silver disc. It was still in the sky when Mrs* Bricker reached town. She went into a grocery store and told what she had seen* Another shopper reported that her son had just told her as she left home that some men was breaking in on his short wave radio to report strange lights in the sky. Later that evening, the local telephone operator received two calls from Odin, 111. (£-10 miles southeast) asking where to report strange lights in the sky north of Odin.

By Ted Phillips From the physical trace file, now containing 497 reports, one finds involve animal, human or mechanical effects. Perhaps the most fascinating effect involves animal reaction. Animals are impartial witnesses; they are not influenced by magazine articles and books or other reported events re- lated to the UFO problem. The following is a brief look at the better an- imal reaction cases. Valenciennes, France, Sept. 10, 1954. Witness was reading when he heard his dog barking. Thinking it might be a prowler, he took a flashlight and went outside* He saw a dark mass less then 20 feet from his house. The dog was suddenly quite frightened and the witness heard footsteps and turned to- wards the sound. Less than 12 feet away he saw two small beings, tie ran toward them and a beam of light was projected from an opening in the dark mass, and he was unable to move. Police found five places on three of the wooden ties which had identical impressions, each about an inch end a half square. Stones were brittle as if calcined at very high temperature* Sev- eral residents in the area reported that they had seen a reddish object in the sky at about the time the witness indicated the object had left. Valence, France, Sept. 26, 1954* Witness had gone to gather mushrooms in the woods not far from a small village. Her dog began to bark and then began howling as if in misery. She looked around and saw the dog was stand- ing in front of something which she thought at first was a scarecrow. As she approached it, she saw that it was a small being in a suit similar to a diving suit. The witness ran into a nearby thicket* By this time the dog was howling again, accompanied by the howls of the other dogs in the village* A large metallic object rose from behind nearby trees and moved away at low altitude making a whistling sound. A circular area was found about 11 feet in diameter, in which the shrubs and bushes were crushed* Wheat was flatten- ed in a radiating line along the flight path. Brazil, Nov* 1957* Witness saw a landed object, dark colored which emitted heat and blinding light. His horse refused to approach it. He threw stones at the object from a distance of 70 feet. The stones fell to the ground about 35 feet from the object. The horse still refused to go into the area after the object took off. A circle of scorched grass 105 feet in diameter was found. Argentina, July 2, 1966. Witness saw two men of normal height. Near them was an elliptical, silvery object, 7 feet long, with 3 landing legs. Witnesses' horse and dog were paralyzed for several minutes. The boy arrived home \"like a madman.\" The object took off vertically at great speed with flashes of light. Inspection showed three holes which had gone into the ground to a depth of 5 inches and formed a triangle. New Zealand, Oct. 5, 1969. C. T. Johnson, sheep farmer, found 3 brown colored circles, two on the side of a steep hill, 53 and 30 feet in diame- ter—the third circle was across a fence. Horse reared up and wouldn't go near the area. New Zealand, Oct. 3, 1969* Charles Blackmore, dairy farmer, found circle of dead lake-weed on floating island in a large pond, 15 feet in diameter- area, two feet lower than other plants on island. Area appeared to have been burned, pressed down and spread outwards in a spiral pattern. Cows and dogs refused to go near the pond from which they had always drank before. Ducks and frogs vanished from the island and pond. Editor's Note: If you know of a physical trace case, old or new, do send the complete report to Ted Phillips, Box 615, Sedalia, Mo., 65301.

June 1972 - Mr. Pierre Leclerc, the witness, relates himself the sighting as it occurred for him: \"I left home to go to a restaurant at the Shopping Centre \"Place Lirray,\" here at Orsainville, situated on the Garden Avenue. Around 10:05 P.M. on my way back to home, at Place des Tilleuls, I saw something lum- inous in the sky; I was in my car at this moment and was entering in my garage alley to park my car* I was coming from the north and so, what 1 saw in the sky was moving in the direction of the south* \"It was e kind of luminous ball of fire, orange-yellow colored, mov- ing to the direction of the south with a very slowly speed. I stopped the car in the entry. It was about 10:07 p.m. at this moment. I got out of the car. The ball of fire was always there, moving in a straight line towards the south. I called my wife and told her, 'Look over the Place and tell me what you seeP y he looked and saw the same luminous bell. My daughter Jeanne, age 12, heard my call to her mother and ran to the window where she saw also the phenomenon in the sky surrounded by a kind of halo, but less luminous or less colored than the ball itself. \"Suddenly at 10:13 p.m., probably over the main part of the city (I couldn't say exactly the distance and the altitude, unfortunately) two other balls of fire, but smaller than the original one, seemed to sep- arate from the first one, went down slowly towards the ground and dis- appeared suddenly. n \"Finally, after some other seconds (10 or 15), the first ball of fire, always in progression in the sky, seemed to become smaller and smaller, like if it was shrinking and finally it literally vanished in the sky. \"At one moment I heard a sound or something like an airplane or motor noise. In addition of that we saw nothing like a pulsation or like a twinkling light, just a luminous ball of fire, with the characteristics described before.\" This report was submitted to the Socie'te\" de Hecherches sur les Phe'nomenes MysteYieux and published in their regular magazine, the AFFA* It also appeared in two French newspapers.

After a few seconds, the object moved to the right of the witnesses and atthe same moment a second object, which may have been hidden by the first one, moved to the left of the observers. It was conjectured it could have been one object, with a separation occuring. ^ome 20 seconds after the \"separation\" both objects seemed to disappear, alternatively, and then reappear. In less than 30 seconds they \"dimmed\" and faded out* The possibility of the object being a star or ordinary aircraft was ruled out.

That incident, supposedly, resulted in the discovery lor realization) of gravity, Some people disagree. One of them is James Carter. He says: \". . it can be shown by simple experiment that, after breaking loose from its stem, the apple remained motionless while the earth, the tree and .Isaac Newton accel- erated upward at 32 fps , until his head struck the apple.\" This is all part of what Carter calls the Theory of Universal Expansion. That is, \"the earth is constantly increasing in size end. . . the acceleration felt on its surface is a result of this increase... every atom in the universe is ex- panding at the same rate.\" Quite a theory, eh? With regard to UFOs, Carter believes them to be something on the order of the \"atmospheric jelly-fish\" postulated by Ivan Sanderson and other researchers. Carter's booklet, \"Gravity Does Not Exist,\" is available from Universal Expansion Press - P. 0. Box 331 - Avalon, CA 90704 for $1.00. Another publication dealing with the \"ancient space visitors\" theme is Egerton Sykes' booklet, \"Extraterrestrial Landings.\" Many of the topics mentioned by Sykes—the Tassili Frescoes, the Book of Ezekiel, the Star of Bethlehem, etc.—will be familiar to many readers, but he also includes some data not widely publicized previously. Curiously, Sykes sees no connection between space visitors of long ago and our present-day UFOs. I, for one, am always at a loss to account for this peculiar attitude when it crops up. Nevertheless, the booklet is well worth reading and is available from Markham House Press Ltd. - 53 West St. - Brighton BN1 2RA, England. The price is $1.00.

This particular article was titled \"Other Letters.\" \"On the afternoon of March 29th of this year at about 4:00 p.m., after the thick cloud cover had disappeared, I saw a group of skiers on the path to the platform which is directly in front of our observa- tion station, looking to the sky and pointing to something they were observing in the sky. I looked where they were pointing and I observed a shining object which was stationary and east of my point of observation and about 75 to $0 degrees above the horizon. I took a pair of binoculars (6x30) end I looked at the object through them* *It had the shape of a cone, the side facing the sun was very bright. I watched it until dark and after the sunset the shine dwindled and the object disappeared little by little, without moving from the spot in the sky. At 7:50 a.m. the next morning {March 30th) I found that the object observed 19 hours earlier was now over the station of observation, but had moved a little to the south and again was very bright on the side facing the sun. At 9:00 a.m. I noticed it moving slightly, almost im- perceptibly in a southwesterly direction. At 10:00 a.m. 1 decided to call my colleagues at the neighboring meteorological stations of Car- ansebes, Tarcu Peak and Cuntu Mountain. I remained in contact with them by the radio and ten minutes later they confirmed that they saw this object. \"It continued to move slowly to the southwest and disappeared at 12:00 noon* At 1:00 p.m. we were called by the Caransebes Station and told that the object was observed by the meteorological station at Berzesca, which is located on the banks of the Danube, but they did not have a pair of binoculars and they reported that it resembled a parachute* \"On the same day (March 30th) at 4:00 p.m. it appeared again in the same spot in the wky where I had first observed it the previous day. Again, I watched it with my colleague Vasile Cotoi from Tarcu Peek till after sun- set when it no longer could be seen. At about 6:00 am (March 31st) it was once again above the Semenic Mountain, but the clouds and the fog hamper- ed me in viewing it clearly.

One version has it that six flares were seen yesterday, fired from beneath the surface of the fiord to a height of about 500 feet. Yesterday, Norwegian defense officials said their efforts to track the elusive object by radar and sonar were being hampered by jamming.

They are thought to come fromthe heat of impacting meteorites or possibly from the belch of a still-living volcano, we are told. . * .Lucius Farish sent us a clipping from « Canadian newspaper which states that John Musgrave, a former Californian, is conducting a course on UFO sightings at Grant MacEwan Community College in Edmonton. Mr. Musgraves, if you are the same John Musgraves, of Edmonton, who sub- scribes to SKYLOOK, .bow about sending us some Canadian UFO reports. We'd be glad to hear from you. . . George D. Fawcett sent us a UFO Review of 1972, and we hope to find room for it in another issue. It f s good. . . . Warm thanks to all who sent personal Christmas greetings. With so many nice U-folks (think Lou coined that one) it ! s no wonder we have the \"happy sound.\". . . And now we want to pay tribute to Walt Andrus. As editor of SKYLOOK, we may realize more than anyone else how hard Walt has worked in organizing and building up MUFON. In addition to enthusiasm and hard work, it takes a lot of know-how, and Walt has shown he has has all that. We hope hope he will continue to serve as our Director foreverI —Ye Ed"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ARE YOU MOVING? Please send us your change of address at once.
