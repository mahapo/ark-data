FROM THE EDITOR With any luck we'll soon be back on our regular publication schedule. In the meantime, you'll find the contents of this issue not all that outdated. We have a startling story from a recent issue of Paris Match, a follow-up to last month's \"Great Belgian UFO Flap,\" along with coverage of the MUFON 1990 Inter- national UFO Symposium and a brief survey of events in Medjugorje, Yugoslavia. Perhaps as soon as September we'll be devoting an entire issue to the subject of UFOs and religion. In the meantime, we appreciate your patience.

Paris Match is a slick French week- ly something like a classy cross be- tween Time and People magazines. It is very widely read and something of a journalistic institution. Although the reader can count on the latest gossip concerning Charles and Lady Di, each issue also contains serious coverage of political and scientific issues. Thanks to the linguistic abilities of my wife, I have translated an astonishing article that appeared in the July 5, 1990 issue. This recounts a series of sightings of a UFO over Belgium. There were thousands of witnesses, and the object was tracked simultaneously by two ground radar installations and by the airborne in- tercept radars of two F-16 fighters sent to chase it. But by far the most significant aspect of this case is that the Belgian government released all the data and worked in close cooperation with a civilian UFO research organization. To the best of my knowledge, this is uni- que in the history of ufology. Indeed, it is the \"political\" aspect that prodded me to take the considerable time and effort to make this translation available to ufologists worldwide via the MUFON UFO Journal. The article itself, by Marie-Therese de Brosses, is copyrighted by Paris Match. The Belgian Defense Minister has authorized us to publish this report. It is the \"scoop of the sky.\" These two screens (see photos) are the incon- testable witnesses of a meeting of science and fiction. In an unprece- dented action, the Belgian Air Force has released pictures of the radar im- ages of UFOs intercepted by the pilots of their F-16 fighters. It was the preci- sion and clarity of the pictures that convinced the Defense Minister to order full resources deployed in the gigantic chase of the UFO during the Easter weekend. Paris Match takes you behind the symbols and numbers of these exceptional pictures to discover the incredible performance of those flying objects which are very real but nonetheless unidentified. We may not be the only ones in the universe. There are people in the military ser- vices who are normally silent on this subject, but who now say the UFOs are not a myth. On June 22nd, for the first time in history, an Air Force revealed an important piece of this story which is not science fiction. On this day, after going through a meticulous security screening, I found myself in the headquarters of the Belgian Air Force, near Brussels. In a small room, Colonel DeBrouwer, Chief of Operations of the Belgian Air Force, started a video tape recorder. On the screen appeared the film that was brought back in the \"black box\" of the F-16 that was launched to chase the UFO. This, it turned out, was not the really important chase, which would happen two weeks later, when practically all of Belgium tried to capture the UFO. But until now we were not told about the one Col. Brouwer was about to describe. The Belgian military had been on the alert since November 1989, when numerous reports by the Gendar- merie (National police force) began pouring in daily telling of observations of the UFOs above Belgian territory. It had started on the crazy night of November 29, 1989, during which 30 groups of witnesses, among them three police patrols, scattered over 800 square kilometers of territory be- tween Liege and the German/Neth- erlands border, reported UFOs. All of those witnesses observed for hours a strange triangular object nearly silent, maneuvering at very low speed and very low altitude, without creating the least amount of turbulence. As do all the world's Air Forces, the Belgian military have at their disposal supersonic interceptor airplanes ready 24 hours a day to take off with five minutes' notice. In this case we are talking about two F-16 single-pilot fighters, armed with missiles. Head- quarters was prudent and conser- vative. During the previous month the two planes have twice been sent in response to sightings, but without results. The first time they saw nothing. The second instance was at- tributed to an advertising searchlight for a night club. On the night of March 30th, one of the callers reporting a UFO was a Captain of the national police at Pin- son, and Headquarters decided to make a serious effort to verify the reports. In addition to the visual sightings, two radar installations also saw the UFO. One radar is at Glons, southeast of Brussels, which is part of the NATO defense group, and one at Semmerzake, west of the Capitol, which controls the military and civilian traffic of the entire Beligan territory. The range of the two radars is 300 kilometers, which is more than enough to cover the area where the reports took place. In this region the land is fairly flat, rolling country without any prominent hills. The radar has a perfect view of all flying objects with an altitude about 200 meters over the ground. Nevertheless, Headquarters determined to do some very precise studies during the next 55 minutes to eliminate the possibili- ty of prosaic explanations for the radar images. Excellent atmospheric con- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 268 August 1990"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ditions prevailed, and there was no possibility of false echoes due to temperature inversions. All military and civilian airplanes are equipped with a device called a transponder which permits their im- mediate identification on the radar screen in the form of a coded signal. The radar echo received on that night was like that of an airplane that was moving at very low speed, about 50 KM per hour, and frequently chang- ing direction and altitude. But it did not send any identifying transponder signal. Naturally, the Belgian Air Force can't permit an unidentified object to fly over its territory. So at 0005 hours the order was given to the F-16s to take off and to find the intruder. The lead pilot concentrated on his radar screen, which at night is his best organ of vision. The F-16 is equipped with very sophisticated equipment, includ- ing chase radar, which is not fixed directly ahead of the airplane, but makes a wide search in an arc of 90 degrees left and right of the nose. Slightly behind the lead fighter, the wingman in the second F-16 followed the movements of the first jet, con- centrating on maintaining contact with the center of coordination of the search. Suddenly the two fighters sported the intruder on their radar screens, appearing like a little bee dancing on the scope. Using their joy sticks like a video game, the pilots ordered the onboard computers to pursue the target. As soon as lock-on was achieved, the target appeared on the screen as a diamond shape, telling the pilots that from that moment on the F-16s will remain tracking the object automatically. On the screen is in- dicated the object's position, distance and speed. The object was very close to the fighters. On this portion of the video tape that Col. DeBrouwer has, in such an exceptional manner, allowed us to see, we can hear the radio exchange of the two pilots. The emotions of the pilots are clearly perceptible. \"Look,\" the Colonel tells me, stopping the VCR, and showing me the diamond PHOTO CAPTIONS These two pictures are derived from the internal recording device in the F-16 that chased the UFO on the nights of March 30-31. They are the views on the pilot's display with an interval of several seconds. The one on the left shows the UFO as a diamond, meaning that the radar had locked on to the target. The short vertical lines that frame the diamond on the left and on the right show that the pilot had ordered the com- puter to follow the target, so the radar will continue to automatically track it. At the center of the picture, the \"W\" shows the axis of the flight path of the F-16, with digitalized direction of 256 degrees (west/southwest) shown under and to the left. The lines on each side of the \"W\" are the artificial horizon. The word \"AIR\" on the top of the screen means that the radar is programmed to search for all targets in the air at an altitude higher than 200 meters over the ground. The UFO is at an altitude of 2,000 meters, shown on the picture by 07 (7,000 feet) at the top right. The next picture shows that the UFO dived toward the ground in one second. The picture on the right shows the target at an altitude of 00, meaning that it is below the altitude range of the radar, that is, below 200 meters. The line of the artificial horizon falls off (rotates), showing the bank angle of the plane as it tries to align itself with the UFO, which is diving. The column of numbers under the diamond give the direction of flight of the target, 290 degrees (west northwest), the speed, 990 knots or Mach 1.50, and the 080R shows the nature of the target in coded language. This particular code means that the computer does not recognize the nature of the target. In the interval between these two pictures the UFO had accelerated through the sonic barrier, but without making any sonic boom. In one second it would be lost to the pilots.

Once they are launched, internal com- puters in the missiles intelligently guide the missiles to the target by themselves. Of course, in this case of the UFO there was no question of doing that. We only wanted to identify the intruder\" shape on the screen, \"At this stage in the chase in our military jargon it means a successful interception.\" Automatic Targeting Then I said, in layman's terms, what does a \"successful interception\" mean? He answered, \"Our fighter planes are armed with automatically self-directed missiles. Once they are launched, internal computers in the missiles intelligently guide the missiles to the target by themselves. Of course, in this case of the UFO there was no question of doing that. We only wanted to identify the intruder.\" The pilot did not even have time to start this procedure, which requires the fighter's radar to stay locked on for at least six seconds. But the ob- ject had sped up from an initial veloci- ty of 280 KPH to 1,800 KPH, while descending from 3,000 meters to 1,700 meters ... in one second! This fantastic acceleration corresponds to 40 Gs. It would cause immediate death to a human on board. The limit of what a pilot can take is about 8 Gs. And the trajectory of the object was extremely disconcerting. It arrived at 1,700 meters altitude, then it dove rapidly toward the ground at an altitude under 200 meters, and in do- ing so escaped from the radars of the fighters and the ground units at Glons and Semmerzake. This maneuver took place over the suburbs of Brussels, which are so full of man- made lights that the pilots lost sight of the object beneath them. \"In any event, it was out of the question for the F-16 to catch up with the object at this low altitude, where the density of the air limits the speed to 1,300 KPH. Above that speed, the temperature in the compressors of the jet turbines would cause the engines to burst,\" said Col. DeBrouwer. \"There was a logic behind the motions of the object.\" Everything indicates that this object was intelligently directed to escape from the pursuing planes. During the next hours the scenario repeated twice. The Commander of the Belgian Air Force gave me a detailed report which had been produced by the Belgian Society For The Study of Special Phenomena (SOBEPS) in cooperation with the Air Force. The report states: \"In three cases the pilots managed to get their radars locked on the object, with the immediate result that the object's behavior drastically changed. The object literally played hide and seek with the fighters. It dived toward the ground to evade the airborne and ground radars. Then it climbed back into radar range in a leisurely manner, thus initiating a new chase. This fantastic game of hide and seek was observed from the ground by a great number of witnesses, among them 20 national policemen who saw both the object and the F-16s. The encounter lasted 75 minutes, but nobody heard the super- sonic boom which should have been present when the object flew through the sonic barrier. No physical damage was reported. Given the low altitudes and speed of the object, many win- dows should have been broken. So, for the first time in history, a newspaper reporter was allowed to see a document which established proof of an interception of a UFO by a military fighter. I have seen on the video screen the flight maneuvers and the extraordinary changes in speed of the UFO. All the details of this affair are related in the report which has just been released by SOBEPS. This col- laboration between the Air Force of a nation and a private research group is without precedent and must be MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 268 August 1990"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"taken very seriously. Also, the com- petence of the civilian researchers is worthy of trust. This group includes several scientists with excellent credentials, such as physicists Leo Brenig, Professor at the University of .Brussels and August Meessen, Pro- fessor at the Catholic University of Louvain, who has belonged to SOBEPS since its creation 18 years ago. On a television interview, Mr. Guy Coeme, the Minister of Defense, declared that, he had authorized the Air Force to release all information at their disposal to SOBEPS. Discarded Explanations After having seen this dramatic se- quence, I posed a number of ques- tions to Colonel DeBrouwer. First, could the object have been a radiosonde balloon? \"No, the object acted as if it was totally independent of the winds, and we have done, among'other things, a complete review of meteorological conditions. This is why we did not publish the report until now. We wanted to do a complete study to verify all aspects of the case. ; Our military defense system is not prepared for this sort of thing. We had to analyze and interpret the data from the recording made inside the, fighters.\" Is it a natural phenomen^ or per- haps the debris from rockets or satellites, space junk? \"No, a mete- orite or a fragment of a rocket does not enter the atmosphere in a zig-zag fashion. The analysis of the radar traces showed numerous changes in direction, and the atmospheric con- ditions that prevailed precluded any electromagnetic phenomenon as the cause.\" But, I asked, how about the famous F-117, the American Stealth airplane, which many people think may be responsible? \"This airplane is ab- solutely designed for penetration at low altitude. On the other hand it has a minimum speed of 278 KPH, and the UFO's speed went down to 40 KPH. The F-117 does not have engines that can be tilted down for So, for the first time in history, a newspaper reporter was allowed to see a document which established proof of an interception of a UFO by a military fighter. I have seen on the video screen the flight maneuvers and the extraordinary changes in speed of the UFO. very slow speed flight. Also, no airplane is capable of flying at 1,800 KPH or so low to the ground without creating a sonic boom.\" Then he gave me a telex sent by the Military Attache of the.U.S. Am- bassador to the Commander of the Belgian Air Force confirming that the Stealth airplane was never stationed oh European territory, nor did it ever fly over that territory. Professor Jean Pierre Petit accom- panied me in my visit to the Belgian Air, Force Headquarters. He once served as a controller for jet intercep- tion exercises. Petit is a senior physi- cist, and a director of research with the National Center for Scientific Research of France. He has recently published a book entitled \"Investiga- tion of UFOs,\" published by Editions Albin Michel, and makes this strong statement: \"In reality, there is no machine made by man, either an airplane or a missile, that is capable of such per- formance. Specifically, flying at the speed of sound without making a sonic boom. What degree of con- fidence can we place on this state- ment? The same as that in astro- physics connected with the first detec- tion of a Supernova in 1987 in the Magellanic Clouds galactic group. Proof that the existence of this stellar cataclysm we call a Supernova relies on this single unique observation. I am completely convinced that this type of UFO observation by radar has already happened many times over the past 30 years, either by means of the sophisticated radar of the F-16 which is typical of that used by the world's air forces for the past ten years, or before that by conventional radar. And those countries who have had radar contacts have kept the fact in strict secrecy in order to avoid public panic.\" But what is happening right now, what is the reason for this sudden revelation of the truth? \"We are living in a time that is the beginning of a period of openness. First the Berlin Wall crumbled, now the wall of silence about UFOs is fall- ing. Concerning the UFOs, we are entering a phase completely different from the earlier ones. It is the end of commercialism and fakery. The true scientists are finally making their ap- pearance. Look at the work of Pro- fessor Meessen.\" Surprise Photos \"SOPEBS has collected more than 1000 eyewitness reports from the UFO wave over Belguim. One report is especially interesting. On the night of March 31, at a location 30 KM southeast of Brussels, three complete- ly reliable witnesses had a sighting. They were Lucien Clerebaut, Secretary General of SOBEPS, Patrick Ferrym, a Moving Picture Pro- ducer and Jose Fernandez. They observed a bright luminous light low on the horizon. The light got bigger and closer, and was seen to be an ob- ject of triangular form with rounded angles. It was carrying four spotlights and the periphery of the object had numerous smaller lights around it. As it passed over their heads at an altitude which they estimated to be 300 to 400 meters, the object had a diameter six times that of a full moon. Mr. Ferrym took four pictures of the object with a very high sensitivity film with an ASA of 1,600. As a control he photographed an ordinary airplane several minutes later, using the same shutter opening and speed. \"When the film was developed he got a surprise.

It is the end of commercialism and fakery.\" the airplane were clearly shown on the pictures. But the 'spotlights' on the UFO, which to the naked eye had been much stronger than the lights on the airplane, were hardly discernible. The general form of the UFO, which had also been clearly visible, was lost on the film. It should be noted that the UFO was also much closer to the observers than the airplane. \"Recalling that a simple infrared ray can prevent some films from being ex- posed, Professor Meessen perform- ed an experiment in his laboratory. Using a prism, he projected directly on unexposed film a spectrum of light, going from red to purple, superimposing an infrared ray on the lower part of the negative. When the film was developed, the spectrum of light is perfectly visible in the portion of the film untouched by the infrared ray, but considerably attenuated, though not completely annihilated, where the infrared light struck the film.\" The Professor continued, \"If the UFOs are really a physical object, and if they propagate infrared light, it would be quite normal that photo- graphs would contain some surprises when they were developed. This could include the total disappearance of the object that had been observed visually. This would explain the very low number of pictures that we have received in this UFO wave as well as the failure to get close-up pictures. Professor Meessen remained very conservative. As a good disciple of the famous scientist Claude Bernard, he is faithful to the Scientific Method, which consists of observing facts, then proposing hypotheses to explain the facts, and finally accomplishing ex- perimental verification of the hypotheses. To him it is absolutely essential to study this enigmatic file of UFO reports: \"There are too many independent eyewitness reports to ig- nore. Too many of the reports des- cribe coherent physical effects, and there is an agreement among the ac- counts concerning what was ob- served. If all of these witnesses are ly- ing, then it is a mental disease of such novelty and proportions that it must be studied. But of course there are also physical effects. The Air Force report allows us to approach the prob- lem in a rational and scientific way. The simplest hypothesis is that the reports are caused by extraterrestrial visitors, but that hypothesis carries with it other problems. We are not in a rush to form a conclusion, but con- tinue to study the mystery.\" When I met Prof. Meessen, he had not yet seen the document that was shown to me by Col. DeBrouwer. This was the Belgian Air Force report on the successful interceptions of March 30th, which allowed us to understand why the military had placed at the disposal of SOBEPS such facilities as the F-16 interceptors and a twin-engine Hawker airplane. The Hawker could carry a large number of researchers and many measuring devices, including an enor- mous infrared camera. During this eventful weekend, which drew in tens of thousands of witnesses, the military had put top priority on the UFO, but was remaining silent. They wanted to know more before speaking. The press was astonished by the \"unsuccessful\" hunt on this Easter weekend. But it is all clear now. We could not say that the UFO did not actually meet us, because there were many observations from the ground. But if the device had stayed under 200 meters in altitude, it would have been undetectable by radar. Now the sightings have dribbled off, the witnesses rarer and rarer. But the questions still remain. How discon- certing this wave of UFO sightings over Belgium! First of all, why Belgium? Why these thousands of witnesses in a six month period? In previous decades witnesses often described landings, but why were there no landing reports? Why the triangular shape of the UFO, reported by more than 90 percent of the witnesses? At the moment, all of these are questions without an answer. \"For us, the release of this report by the Belgian Air Force and the con- fidence in us that it bespeaks is the reward for 18 years of work,\" con- cluded Lucien Clerebaut of SOBEPS. Regardless of the frustrating ir- regularity of this phenomenon (waves of sightings mixed with long periods of absence), and regardless of the sar- casms of those scientists who are violently hostile to this kind of in- vestigation, which they consider to be a sort of scientific disease, a few emi- nent scientists such as Professors Meessen, Brenig and Petit continue their methodical work. Now is the time to help them. Notes 1) A \"G\" is a unit of acceleration.

This material was originally published in the New York Tribune in his column titled \"Science Frontiers.\" Over 800 people crowded the Pen- sacola Civic Center on the weekend of July 7 and 8 to attend the annual symposium of the Mutual UFO Net- work (MUFON) in this otherwise quiet, Florida Panhandle city. The success of the event was due in large part to the UFO flap that has been go- ing on around Pensacola and its small suburb of Gulf Breeze for the last 2 1 /? years. The heated controversy over a series of polaroid color photos taken by local house builder Ed Walters, depicting what clearly seems to be some kind of spacecraft hovering and shooting blue beams, often made local front page news. Gulf Breeze has undeniably become the \"flying saucer capital of the USA,\" as nearly 20 dif- ferent vending tables at the con- ference displayed all kinds of T-shirts, watches and jewelry, and UFO paraphernalia showing the cha- racteristic Gulf Breeze-type spacecraft and its presumed alien occupants. Business was good and competition heavy. Walters and his wife Frances achieved national notoriety early this year when William Morrow and Com- pany published their book, The Gulf Breeze Sightings, dubbed \"The Most Astounding Multiple Sightings of UFOs in U.S. History.\" The story has been featured in many TV programs and the Walters have toured the country promoting their book and speaking at various UFO conferences. The case — notable due to the large number of photos (39 plus a By J. Antonio Huneeus Photographs by Ansen Seale: video) taken by Walters and other un- canny details he reported between Nov. 11, 1987 and May 1, 1988 - is hotly debated, not only between UFO supporters and skeptics, but be- tween UFO experts themselves. The Walters' case and the photos were pronounced genuine by a number of UFO experts including MUFON's international director Walter Andrus and the organization's team of investigators which followed the case from its inception; New York author and artist Budd Hopkins, who wrote the book's introduction; and Navy optical physicist and photo- analyst Dr. Bruce Maccabee, head of the Fund for UFO Research, who conducted a detailed photographic analysis published as an appendix to the book. Maccabee wrote in the Foreward, \"I have concluded that there is no evidence of a hoax and that the photos in this book are authentic.\" Still another expert supporting Walters is Bob Oechsler, a robotics specialist and former employee of NASA's Goddard Space Center who analyzed the video taken by Walters and enhanced the image with so- phisticated digital equipment. Scrutiny Nevertheless, the Gulf Breeze case has not been smooth sailing for the Walters, despite their big book con- tract and the sale of their story for a miniseries to be produced by a ma- jor TV network. Since the photos were first published a couple of years ago, they have been subjected to in- tense scrutiny and constant accusa- tion from UFO skeptics, local re- porters, residents and even the mayor, Ed Gray. The skeptics have included not only prominent debunkers like Philip Klass, but also UFO researchers who support the existence of the phenomena but have become vehe- mently opposed to this particular case. The evidence against the Walters, while noisy, has so far not been scien- tifically impressive. As we reported several months ago, some skeptics even went to the extreme of falsify- ing evidence to discredit Walters' photos. A bogus picture of a Gulf Breeze-type craft shown flying near the Chrysler Building, made for fun by New York photographer Manuel Fernandez, was published in my col- umn last February, where we ex- posed the questionable techniques of a particular skeptic. The Pensacola News Journal published a front page story June 10 with the banner headline, Gulf Breeze UFO Model Found. Reporter Craig Myers reported that a 9-inch model of a Gulf Breeze-type craft was found in the attic of the garage where Walters had lived at the time of the alleged UFO incidents. Walters had moved out in December of 1988 and the house was uninhabited for a period of time until its new resident moved in. The story was picked up by newswires and lead to the conclu- sion that the model proved the whole case was a hoax. Of course, it didn't make sense that an extremely clever hoaxster, capable of conning experienced UFO in- vestigators and major publishers and TV networks, would leave behind such incriminating evidence and fail to retrieve it during the period of several months when the house was empty. Other details were quickly dis- covered which invalidated the so- called Gulf Breeze model. Photo- graphic analysis done by Maccabee and others showed that although this model was well done and generally similar to the object shown in the photographs, it was too elongated MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 268 August 1990"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Ed and Frances Walters and the Gulf Breeze UFO and had fewer windows or \"port- holes\" than those in the original Polaroid shots. And to make it look like Walters had built the model, draf- ting paper from his own office and in his own handwriting was used in its manufacture. This, however, proved to be the hoaxters' undoing, although no one knows yet who was respon- sible. Walters builds only custom-made houses and therefore no two floor- plans are ever the same. After study- ing the notes and measurements on the drafting paper used in the model, Walters determined that this was part of \"a floor plan I had designed and discarded in Sept. 1989,\" whereas the original photos emerged in the period between late 1987 and early 1988. Walters obtained a letter from his client attesting to this fact and also successfully passed a Psychological Stress Evaluator Test on June 19, showing he was not involved and knew nothing about the model. (He had previously passed two similar tests and two polygraph examinations concerning his UFO experiences.) Walters' conclusion was \"the UFO model is a hoax, planted to discredit the local sightings.\" The model affair, however, was neither the first nor the last attempt to discredit the case. In their lecture at a packed Civic Center in Pensacola, Ed and Frances Walters went through the list. The latest allegation was made by Tommy Smith, a young man who claims he was present when Walters hoaxed some of the photographs. Smith's testimony was given at a press conference in Pensacola prior to the symposium. Smith himself was not present, but his allegations were voic- ed by his parents and Gulf Breeze's Mayor and police chief. A third youth, Hank Boland, who was presumably present with Smith and Walters' son when the alleged hoax was perpe- trated, later published a statement in the Gulf Breeze Sentinel fully suppor- ting Walters. UFOs have become a political \"hot potato in Gulf Breeze and neighbor- ing Pensacola. The mayor is opposed, but a City Councilwoman herself witnessed a UFO shaped like those in the Walters' photos, as have dozens of other local residents and MUFON field investigators. More Witnesses Even reasonable skeptics would agree that if the photos were eventual- ly proven to be fakes, there are still dozens of sightings with a total of more than 100 witnesses, other photos and videos, and related phe- nomena that need to be addressed and explained. This last category in- cludes a circle in the grass similar to England's famous crop circles, and mysterious \"skyquakes\" heard in late January of this year. Meanwhile the military, which has numerous Naval and Air Force facilities in the area, has been unusually quiet about the whole af- fair.

When we asked what our military was searching for we were told,'... given the nature of things that are going on over Gulf Breeze, take your best guess.' \" Roswell The controversial photographs and close encounters in Gulf Breeze, Florida, captured most of the media attention at the recent Annual Sym- posium of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) in nearby Pensacola. Yet Gulf Breeze was but one of many sub- jects addressed by a number of scien- tists and researchers at the MUFON parley under the theme, \"UFOs: The Impact of E.T. Contact Upon Society.\" One of the important presentations was \"New Revelations From Roswell\" by Donald R. Schmitt, Co-Director and Director of Special Investigations of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). Schmitt and Kevin Randle, a retired U.S. Air Force in- telligence captain and author of two UFO books, have conducted a thorough new investigation of the famous crash of an unknown object in Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. The results of their research will be published this fall in the book, Roswell: The Government Recovery of an Alien Space Craft? We've mentioned Roswell several times in past columns — how a scat- tering of puzzling debris was discovered by rancher W.W. \"Mac\" Brazel, how it was retrieved by an in- telligence unit of the 509th Bomb Group of the Roswell Army Air Force Base under Major Jesse Marcel and how the Base Commander even ordered a press release admitting they were \"fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc.\" This statement was quickly changed by General Roger Ramey, Com- Budd Hopkins mander of the Eighth Air Force in Fort Worth, Texas, who explained the whole thing as a misidentification of a radar target in a weather balloon. There the matter rested for over 30 years. The case was reopened in 1980 by William Moore and Charles Berlitz in their book, The Roswell Incident and rekindled a few years ago by the release of the allegedly top secret Majestic-12 (MJ-12) documents which referred to the Roswell crash. Now Randle and Schmitt have combed the territory one more time, visiting the site itself, searching for witnesses and relatives of protagonists now deceased, and correcting some of the mistakes of previous investigators. One of the main discrepancies concerned the report by Grady Barnett that he had seen not just debris, but an entire flying saucer with the corpses of its alien crew in the Plains of San Agustin, near Socorro, some 120 miles from the Brazel ranch. This part of the story did not coincide with the alleged 1952 \"brief- ing paper\" prepared by MJ-12 for president-elect Eisenhower.

Downing now maintains \"the remains of the craft and the bodies were located\" on- ly two and a half miles southeast of the debris field in the Brazel ranch. Of great interest were the list of discrepancies presented by Schmitt against the so-called balloon hypothesis. They succeeded in locating the Roswell base's Provost Marshall and an agent in the Counter- intelligence Corps at the time of the 1947 crash. Neither of them would discuss the event because of secrecy oaths. \"We admire how seriously these gentlemen take their oaths of secrecy after 43 years,\" wrote Schmitt, \"but we must raise this question: Why the need to conceal the recovery of a weather balloon?\" The wreckage was so large it took two days for 50 to 60 troops to com- plete the cleanup, and \"seven con- firmed (possibly eight) flights to transport the remains\" of what would have to be seen, if the government is telling the truth, as the largest and most complicated balloon in history. And then there are the descriptions of the debris itself, which do not cor- respond at all with a weather balloon. r\\_ For instance, Schmitt wrote in his paper that, \"the unusual qualities of the material described to date by four- teen known eyewitnesses are consis- tent in every detail. In appearance, tensile strength, apparent weight- lessness, memory characteristics, uninterpretable symbology, and plastic-like composition, its physical make-up would be difficult to duplicate even by today's standards.\" The Roswell crash is at the heart of the UFO coverup and, unlike many other allegations in the murky world of UFO conspiracies, it gets stronger, not weaker, with time. Panic Myth Also at the symposium, Dr. Brian O'Leary, a former astronaut and astronomer, talked about \"UFOs, Ex- traterrestrials and the New Science,\" where he urged the government \"to go public with its UFO information, regardless of the consequences ... We are well beyond the point of denial and are on the threshold of a cosmic renaissance in human awareness, of which the UFO phenomenon is an in- tegral part,\" he said. Sociologist Dr. Robert Hall discuss- ed the myth of mass panic vis-a-vis governmental UFO disclosures. \"Panic in response to such contact ap- pears very unlikely,\" he wrote in his paper's abstract, adding that \"how- ever, the risk of panic is probably in- creased by governmental treatment of UFO information as secret intelli- gence, a policy apparently guided (or rather, misguided) by misinformation about panic.\" Theologian Dr. Barry Downing, author of The Bible and Flying Saucers, discussed \"the religious dimension\" of ET contact. Publisher Carey Baker addressed the UFO flap in Fyffe, Alabama, while English author John Spencer compared \"The Difference Between Perceptions of UFOlogy in America and Europe.\" UFO abductions were discussed by author Budd Hopkins and Canadian psychotherapist Dr. David Gotlib.

Migliore  . ^ mmi I've just returned from a trip to Medjugorje, Yugoslavia where people are reporting almost daily sightings of the Virgin Mary. These sightings are often accompanied by changes to the sun (it seems to spin and \"dance\"). There are also sightings of rings, \"like the rings that are the symbols of the Olympic games,\" that move from the sun to the church at the time the Virgin Mary is appearing. The appari- tions appear to both groups and individuals. These phenomena have many si- milarities to UFO sightings, and I was interested in gaining a first-hand ex- perience from a (hopefully) unbiased vantage point. The events have been going on since 1981, and are very similar to the occurrences at Fatima, Portugal. They resemble other Virgin Mary appearances that have been oc- curring throughout Christian history. Refer to \"UFOs and the Miraculous,\" by Michael Grosso, UFO, Volume 5, Number 2, 1990 (March/April). Medjugorje is located in the hills near the Adriatic coast, about half way between Split and Dubrovnik. The site is quite remote, in a hilly, agricultural area of Yugoslavia. The population is essentially Catholic, Serbo-Croatian. Over the years, Medjugorje has become a pilgrimage site for the religious and the curious. Refer to an excellent article, \"The Message of Medjugorje\" by Margaret Tabor Millin, in New Realities, March/April 1990. I spoke with several pilgrims, and the most common anomalies are as follows (in order by frequency): • Flat Sun. The sun appears flat. lYou can stare at it with no harmful ef- ffjects. The disk of the sun seems to be Isilvery.iOjj.-gray, sometimes spinning, jjsometimes in the shape of a child's toy ](top?). Some pilgrims describe the |disk\"Qf;theisun\"as»similar t to.. the form of a communion wafer. • Lights, Objects Near the Sun. On occasion other lights surround the disk of the flat sun and sometimes cir- cle the central disk or move back and forth toward the church where the ap- paritions are appearing (daily about 6:40 p.m.). Some observers report circles, wheels and rings, like the Olympic Games' symbols, that move slowly towards the church, and zip back to the sun just before they touch the tower where the apparition is occurring. Typically, hundreds of people observe such events at the same time. Some also report seeing letters in the sky. The pilgrims I spoke with reported red block letters that \"flash- ed too fast to read.\" Others claim the letters spell \"MIR,\" which is Serbo- Croation for Peace. • Individual Appearances. Many pilgrims report paranormal episodes during prayer, meditation, saying the rosary, during Catholic Mass or dur- ing normal daily activities. Common- ly, the Virgin Mary appears to them, sometimes with words of instruction. Less frequently these appearances oc- cur before or after their pilgrimage to Medjugorje and in dreams. • Group Appearances. Infre- quently the Virgin appears inside St. James Church during the Catholic Mass or during the saying of the rosary. She has appeared to groups of people on \"Cross Hill\" (Krizevac hill), a pilgrimage site about a mile north of the church, and at other loca- tions in and around the town of Med- jugorje. These group appearances are often preceded by flashes of light. • Flashes, Orbs of Light. Usually only the original six children see the apparition of the Virgin Mary. Those observing the children at this time report seeing flashes of light and mov- ing globes of light in the vicinity of the apparition. None of the people I spoke with reported landed craft, UFO entities, missing time or any sort of abduction phenonena.

Related Observations The overwhelming impression is that Medjugorje is a religious ex- perience. Most visitors are on a pilgrimage seeking a direct relation- ship with the Divine, generally in the context of the Catholic religion. There is a hill west of the church where the Virgin first appeared, and many pilgrims visit this site. The real trek, however, is to a larger hill about a mile north called Cross Hill. The Path of Peace leads up this hill: It is probably the most difficult!hike I've ever taken, consisting of extreme- ly jagged white rocks up a steepj in- cline in 106° weather at 95%,/hurhidir ty. I was most impressed by the other pilgrims on this trail. Many were&lder,- ly and infirm, and many-jiwere barefoot. I honestly feel that>the f faith, hope and devotion of these rseekers cannot be separated from; thei.events occurring here. . nj-'O .'Mir-cKO MUFON UFO JOURNAL 1 No.\"268 August 1990"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 During the approximately three hours that I was climbing this moun- tain, starting in the evening and con- tinuing on past nightfall, I saw a pair of helicopters arrive from the north, circle the town several times then head off again to the north. This oc- curred at least twice while I was there. The previous day I also saw a helicopter, but it passed by so low and so fast I could not tell whether it had normal markings. It was a dark khaki color. As in historical appearances of the Virgin Mary, the present events in- clude \"secrets\" to the children original- ly involved, and messages to the general public. The messages claim that nine secrets have been imparted so far. We are told that when the 10th secret is given, the appearances will cease. The information given to the public, and in fact most of the events surrounding Medjugorje, seem to be under the control of the Catholic church. From what I can determine, the messages are not exactly the same as the dogma of the church. My trip to Yugoslavia was part of a vacation to Italy. In Italy, and par- ticularly the Vatican museums, I was surprised at how many classical paint- ings depict sightings of the Virgin Mary - to rulers and peasants, saints and sinners. Many of the churches in Italy were built in response to such vi- sions. I was surprised at how per- vasive this experience seems to be, and that there are Marian societies devoted to just this topic. Suggestions Anomolous events persist in Med- jugorje. I think a full scale investiga- tion by one of the major UFO organizations is warranted. It would be interesting to interview 400 pilgrims (this sample size yields a relability of ± 5%) and see how fre- quently the experiences listed above appear. The messages that the Virgin Mary delivers contain universal truths and metaphysical viewpoints that are not the exclusive domain of the Roman Catholic Church. I think it would be KRIZEVAC HILL Path of Peace PODBRDO HILL Site of first apparition CITLUK 5km  LJUBUSKI 15km THE TOWN OF MEDJUGORJE, YUGOSLAVIA wise for other religious groups and New Age seekers to tune into these events.

This provides a unique opportunity for scientific and religious groups to in- vestigate the remarkable events in Yugoslavia.

Named to head this committee was Dr. Gary Vandenbos, a longtime APA ex- ecutive who has held a variety of posi- tions at the Association. Dr. Vanden- bos released the following remarks: \"It is our aim to discover all that we can about these phenomena. From William James to C.G. Jung, the great psychologists have always been in- terested in the paranormal. It is up to • our generation to pick up the baton that was .dropped and continue with research in this area. We are entering a New Age of psychology and the APA is positioning itself at the forefront of the parapsychological field. We will provide the theoretical structuring that is necessary for for- warding this discipline.\" Dr. Vandenbos went on to explain that the committee would be in- vestigating all forms of paranormal phenomena. \"Following Jung's work with flying saucers, we plan to start with UFO abductions, astrology and psychic healing but we will not limit ourselves solely to these fields of op- portunity. No report will be ignored, no stone will be left unturned. We will try to scientifically determine all we can from every account presented to us.\" Dr. Vandenbos went on to outline his personal reasons for chairing this committee. \"I myself feel that there are a good many things that psycho- logy, in its present state, cannot ex- plain. I have had dreams that have come true. We all have had these ex- periences of deja vu before Freud brought this experience into the mainstream of psychological thought. I think that it is only a manifestation of a greater paranormal power, yet unexplained. Many people have seen UFOs before, myself included, but no one has investigated their psycholo- gical basis. No theory has been able to explain the energy blast that created the Shroud of Turin, but there it is. The APA will provide the scien- tific reasoning that will make sense out of these 'mysterious' experiences and phenomena.\" Dr. Vandenbos concluded that, \"It is in our national interest to explore these phenomena. The APA will be- gin assembling a team of psycho- logists, psychics and lay people who will form the committee. We will be setting up the organizational mechanisms necessary to record and store the information reported to us. We will be getting a 1-800 number so that people from across the United States can call in their reports. We will be establishing a new APA journal called The Journal of American Parapsychology that will allow psychologists, both on the committee and those working independently, to publish their research. We will explain the unexplainable.\" 1-900-USA-UFOS (MENLO PARK, CALIF.; June 18, 1990) — Nuclear physicist lecturer Stanton T. Friedman announced to- day the establishment of a 900 pay- per-call service to provide the public with up-to-date factual information about UFOs: 1-900-USA-UFOS (872-8367). Friedman has lectured about UFOs to public forums at more than 600 colleges and dozens of pro- fessional groups in all 50 states. He has also appeared on hundreds of radio and television programs in- cluding NightLine, Unsolved Mys- teries and several documentary films. \"I know from the huge crowds at my lectures, from the long question and answer sessions and from the full phone lines on talk shows, that there is a great public interest on a serious approach to the question of flying saucers,\" said the 55-year-old scientist whose past employers in- clude GE, GM, Westinghouse and TRW. \"Over 23 million people have seen UFOs according to Gallup polls and the government has released documents through FOIA (freedom of information act) that support crash- ed saucers,\" explains Friedman. \"But the major news media con- tinue to ignore the biggest story of the century. It is hard to believe;, but more than 100 media outlets in the Wash- ington DC area have refused to cover a recent story from the Soviet Union involving comments from the general in charge of the Soviet Air Defense Command and testimony from 5 of his military pilots. They described a round craft over 300 feet in diameter, able to both hover and move at 2-3 times the speed of a jet fighter, make incredible maneuvers silently, and was seen on ground and air radar and visually from above and below,\" Fried- man added. UFOLine will provide frequently updated information on all aspects of the UFO subject, including the latest document releases related to the Cosmic Watergate, new evidence concerning the recovery of a crash- ed flying saucer in New Mexico, UFO abductions, physical evidence, land- ing cases, the myths of the noisy negativists, and the far out technology that may well be involved. Callers will also be able to report their own experience/sighting con- fidentially for future investigation. Calls cost $2 for the first minute and $1 per minute thereafter.

UFO Experience A dozen UFO researchers and ab- ductees will tell of latest developments in ufology at the fourth annual inter- national conference on \"The UFO Ex- perience\" on October 13-14, 1990 at the Holiday Inn (formerly the Ramada Inn), North Haven, Connec- ticut, USA. The conference will offer a com- prehensive look at the UFO phe- nomenon. Eminent investigators from around the world will present their fin- dings and considered opinions about what UFOs are, where they come from, why they are here, what the government knows about it and why it is covering up. Former Apollo astronaut Brian O'Leary, Ph.D., will speak on \"UFOs and Inner/Outer Space.\" The author of Exploring Inner and Outer Space, Dr. O'Leary has called for a congres- sional investigation of the possibility of government coverup of the UFO phenomenon. An astronomer and professor of space sciences and physics at Cornell, Princeton, Cal Tech and University of California at Berkeley, O'Leary has personally ex- plored the UFO phenomenon and believes it deserves full-scale scientific research. He also believes that in- vestigation of the Martian geological formation called \"The Face on Mars\" is needed because the formation may be evidence of extraterrestrial life. O'Leary will be the featured Saturday night speaker. Abductee Travis Walton of Arizona, author of The Walton Ex- perience, will tell of his five-day ab- duction in 1975 by alien beings in a UFO. The aliens appeared to be about four feet tall with high-domed hairless heads, large catlike eyes and grayish, leathery skin, although one was taller and humanlike with nordic features. Walton's abduction was witnessed by six people, who passed polygraph testing of their story. When Walton reappeared, he was tested also and found to be telling the truth as he knew it. His story is being filmed by Hollywood as Fire in the Sky. Abductee Ed Walters and his wife Frances of Gulf Breeze, Florida, will show slides of the UFOs which have appeared to them near their home since 1987. There are hundreds of other witnesses. Ed Walters' photos and videotapes have been analyzed by experts and pronounced authen- tic. They were featured in a segment of the TV program \"Unsolved Mysteries\". A book by Ed Walters en- titled The Gulf Breeze Sightings was just published and will be broadcast as a miniseries next year. Stanton Friedman of Canada, a nuclear physicist with a master's degree from the University of Cfti- cago, will tell the latest findings in the extraordinary cased called the Roswell Incident, a 1947 incident in which a UFO apparently crashed in New Mex- ico and was recovered by the military. Friedman is the chief investigator of the Roswell case. He has lectured in- ternationally about UFOs and ap- peared on national television several times to discuss them, including \"Nightline,\" \"The Sally Jesse Raphael Show\" and \"Unsolved Mysteries.\" Jacques Vallee Ph.D., ufologist and author of Confrontations: A Scientist's Search for Alien Contact, which describes his research into MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 268 August 1990"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 hundreds of UFO cases over three decades, will summarize his findings in a slide-illustrated talk entitled \"Dimensions of the UFO Experience.\" He believes that UFOs are not ex- traterrestrial at all, but are a paranor- mal phenomenon from dimensions outside our space-time and can manipulate physical reality in ways which defy current scientific understanding. Formerly an assistant to world-renowned ufologist Dr. J. Allen Hynek, he is widely considered one of the leading investigators in the field. He was born in France and served as the model for the French scientist in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" Other notable UFO investigators will also present their research. Paul Devereux of England is an author of Earth Lights Revelation, which describes his research into unusual energy effects at prehistoric sites. These exotic luminous pheno- mena, which he terms \"earth lights,\" emerge from the planet itself in distinct geographical locations. Devereux says they have much to teach society, not only about geo- physics and the effects of earth energies on human consciousness, but also about the UFO phenome- non. Ann Druffel, a California resear- cher for the major UFO organizations in the United States, will report on her research into UFO cases where the people intended for abduction have been able to resist their abductors. In her talk, entitled \"How to Resist UFO Abductions,\" she will describe several of the experiences of these people and their techniques for resisting ab- duction. Druffel believes the abduc- tions violate people's civil and human rights. She is co-author of The Tu- junga Canyon Contacts, which was published in 1980 and is one of the earliest accounts of a UFO abduction. Antonio Huneeus is a globetrotting journalist who reports on the UFO phenomenon for newspapers and magazines in North and South America. He will speak on \"Red Skies: UFOs Behind the Iron and Bamboo Curtains.\" He has lectured and appeared on numerous radio and TV talk shows in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Harry Lebelson, a freelance writer who used to be UFO editor for Omni magazine, will speak on \"Broken Silence: Military Testimony about UFOs.\" His interest in UFOs began in 1955 when he had a daylight sighting of a metallic disc near his home in New Jersey. His UFO research at Pine Bush, New York, was reported na- tionally on \"PM Magazine.\" His writing about UFOs has appeared in publica- tions in North and South America, Japan and China. Fred Max is a professional hyp- notist from Cheshire, Connecticut, who works closely with area internists and psychiatrists. He has appeared on the TV show \"PM Magazine\" and lec- tured on hypnosis and behavioral medicine at various universities. Recently he was filmed as he hyp- notically regressed UFO abductee Whitley Strieber at Strieber's cabin in upstate New York for use in a televi- sion program later this year.

From the New York airports, take air service across Long Island sound to New Haven (about half an hour) or limo service New Haven (about 1.5 hours). Then take a local taxi to the con- ference site. F-16, Continued Translator's Note (Obviously, we require a detailed ex- planation of the F-16 data display, as well as a readout of the entire sequence. The article speaks of \"several seconds\" and then \"one second\" as the interval be- tween pictures. The display is in knots, one nautical mile (6,080 feet) per hour, and the altitude is shown by adding two zeros to give feet. This is an American fighter, and the data is in the \"English\" system, but the author obviously wrote the article for the readership that uses the metric system. My protractor shows that the F-16 was in level flight in the first pic- ture, then in a 50-degree bank to the right and considerably nose-down in the se- cond picture, and one would suppose that it was increasing both the bank and the dive angle during this frame, in an attempt to track the UFO. Although the eye witnesses reported a triangular object, the shape on the screen is computer generated and has no connection with the actual shape of the object being tracked by the F-16's radar.) MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 268 August 1990"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 Looking Back Bob Gribble August 1950 • About 11:30 a.m. on the 5th (or 15th), Nick Mariana, 38, general manager of a minor league baseball team, the Electrics, was working at the Legion ball park in Great Falls, Montana, when he sported something strange in the sky. \"As I looked up I saw two silver ob- jects moving swiftly out of the north- west,\" Mariana said. \"The objects were very bright and about 10,000 feet in the air. They appeared to be of a bright shiny metal, like polished silver. Both were the same size and were traveling at the same rate of speed which was much slower than the jets that shot by shortly after I filmed the discs. \"Suddenly they stopped. It was then I remembered the camera in the glove compartment of my car. I raced downstairs and yelled for my secretary, Miss Virginia Raunig. The distance from the top of the stairway to my car is about 60 feet and I must have made that in about six jumps. I asked my secretary if she saw any- thing and she said yes, two silvery spheres. I unlocked the glove com- partment of my car, took out the camera, turned the telephoto lens on the turret into position, set the camera at f-22, picked up the objects in the viewfinder and pressed the trigger. \"The spheres appeared to be spin- ning like a top and were about 50 feet across and about 50 yards apart. I could not see any exhaust, wings or any kind of fuselage. There was no cabin, no odor, no sound, except I thought I heard a whooshing sound when I first saw them. As the film clicked through the camera I could see the objects moving southeast be- hind the General Mills grain building and the black water tank directly south of the ball park. I filmed the ob- jects until they disappeared into the blue sky behind the water tank.\" Mariana recalls that the Koda- chrome original — which was sub- mitted to the Air Force — comprised 315 frames. The first 30-odd frames showed larger images of the UFOs with a notch or band at one point on the periphery of the objects by which they could be seen to rotate in unison, while on the rest of the film the ob- jects show up only as unarticulated bright white dots. The film, as re- turned by the Air Force, according to Mariana, had the first 35 frames removed. • 1955 About 7 p.m. on the 21st, eight adults and three children were indoors at the Sutton farmhouse at Kelly, Kentucky. Half an hour later, Billy Ray Taylor had gone out to the well for a drink of water, and came running back into the house shouting that he had seen a UFO. He said he observed a silvery object moving silently toward the house, then pass about 30 or 40 feet overhead. It moved over the fields on a horizon- tal course, slowed, came to a stop, then descended into the 40-foot gul- ly at the end of the fields. No one in the house even considered in- vestigating Taylor's story. Other witnesses on nearby farms also saw the object. Around 8 p.m., the family dog began to bark violently. Elmer Sutton and Billy Taylor went to the back door to investigate. Approaching from the fields was a strange glow. As it came closer, they could make out what seemed to be a short \"man,\" though not much like any they had ever seen before. The being was about three- and-a-half feet tall with a large round head and arms that reached almost to the ground. It had large webbed hands with talons (claws) at the end of the fingers. The eyes were huge and glowed with a yellowish light. The whole body appeared to be made of silver metal that gave off an eerie light in the darkness, like the glow from the radium dial on a watch. The being's hands were raised. Sutton and Taylor panicked, and armed themselves. When the strange visitor got to within 20 feet of the house both men fired their weapons. The being somersaulted backwards, \"did a flip,\" scrambled to an upright position, and ran away into the darkness. Again and again, several of the beings maneuvered around the house, terrorizing the occupants. Shots had been fired at the short humanoids at least four times. In one encounter Sutton brought a shotgun to bear on one being and fired at point blank range. It sounded as if the pellets had hit a metal bucket. It was about 11 p.m. when the occupants of the farmhouse got into two cars and fled at high speed for the Hopkinsville police station. Chief of police Green- well was emphatic about what he saw: \"... Those women were scared green. Something scared those people. Something beyond reason, nothing ordinary.\" Except for the huge glowing eyes, the beings were the same color all over. In the dark, this was a phos- phorescent or luminescent glow, but when a light was turned on them this changed to a dull metallic look. The glow of the bodies increased when they were shot at or shouted at. The beings made no noise at any time; the mouth, if such it was, never opened, and they made no sound when mov- ing, although the weeds and bushes rustled when they fled into them. They never exhibited any behavior that could be described as hostile, and made no attempt to retaliate for the shooting. Mrs. Glennie Lankford, the senior adult among those present at the farmhouse said: \"I kept telling MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 268 August 1990"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"19 them (Sutton and Taylor) to come in- to the house and shut the doors. The things weren't doing us any harm.\" • 1965 Don Tennopir, 44, a truck driver, said he was literally \"buzzed\" by a UFO about 25 miles south of Abilene, Kansas, about 1:30 a.m. on the fourth. Describing his experience, Tennopir said: \"I was driving north on Highway 15 ... when all of a sudden the lights on my truck went out. Then they came back on, then off, then back on again. About this time this thing, UFO or whatever, went over my truck with a sizzling or wind-like sound. It scared the hell out of me! It seemed to almost touch the cab — maybe it was 20 feet in the air — and it just swooped down over the road and hovered there not more than 100 feet in front of me. I tell you, I was standing on those brakes! I just didn't know what was happening. It looked like it was going to fall right in the mid- dle of the road, but it didn't. \"I don't know how long it was there. It seemed longer than 20 seconds, but I was just too damn scared to tell time or anything like that. The thing looked round to me. I'd guess it was about 14 or 15 feet in diameter and sort of orange colored ... The object ap- peared to be like a disc. I'd guess it was about two feet thick, and the edge was round. There was a hump, or something like that, in the middle. This hump stuck up about four feet or so. I know this sounds silly, but it looked like a big plate with a cup in the middle. I tell you, I never have been so scared in my life. I regained my senses while this thing was hover- ing over the road and watched it disappear into the southwest. After the thing took off, I ground gears, and I haven't done that in years, and got the hell out of there. Brother, I can tell you, these things are for real.\" • Personnel at the Air Force radar base in Keweenaw Peninsula, Mich- igan, reported \"solid radar contact\" with seven to 10 UFOs moving in a V-formation over Lake Superior on the fourth. The objects came out of the southwest, heading north- northeast at about 9000 miles per hour at an altitude of between 5200 and 17,000 feet. The radar operators said seven other objects were sported over Duluth, Minnesota, and jet in- terceptors gave chase, but were easi- ly outdistanced. A spokesman at the Michigan base said that radar stations in Minnesota, North Dakota and Canada also tracked UFOs. He said the Luther Air Station in Canada reported electronic jamming of its radar. On the same night, residents in Hancock, Calumet, Eagle Harbor, Baraga, and LAnse, Michigan, re- ported seeing UFOs in the night sky. • Harold Butcher, 16, was milking his fathers 17 cows on their farm three miles north of Cherry Creek, New York, about 8:30 p.m. on the 19th, when he heard Jacob, the family bull, bellering away about 50 yards from the barn. He ran to the door and looked. Five hundred feet away, in the pasture, was a metal object sitting on the ground. It was brighter than aluminum, more like chrome. It was shaped like two meat platters, rim-to- rim. He started to run toward the craft and was about 50 to 75 feet away when the strange vehicle emitted a crimson-like vapor which bounced as it struck the grass. The craft then began a vertical climb, and disappeared into the cloud layer. Before taking off the boy said he heard a steady \"beep, beep\" noise. The roar of the takeoff drowned out everything, he said. The vehicle was about 50 feet long, 25 feet wide and 25 feet tall. There were no openings in the craft that Harold could see, and the only light was from the blast-off. About half an hour later, Harold saw the object again, hovering close to the ground across a field about 500 yards north of the point of the first sighting. As the vehicle reached a point over a field south of the Butcher's house, it was sighted by William and Robert Butcher and Kathleen Brougham. They confirmed the description pre- viously reported by Harold. A State Police officer searched the landing area and found a number of places where pieces of sod approximately six inches wide and two feet long had been freshly disturbed. Capt. James M. Dorsey, operations officer of the 4621 Air Force Group, supervised the investigating team at the landing site. He said: \"I don't think this is a hoax. These children saw something. The neighbors feel the same way about it.\" • The Gemini 5 flight on the 21st that took astronauts Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, Jr., on their record-breaking eight-day orbit may have attracted more attention than anticipated, but not from earthlings. According to James R. Peek, 47, of Malabar, Florida, at least three UFOs and possibly four, were photographed in the vicinity of the Cape within seconds of lift-off. Peek, a senior engineering laboratory technician, op- tics expert, and experienced amateur photographer, was out on his front lawn that historic morning. But in his case, he got there a few seconds too late to see the actual lift-off. He had his camera all set to photograph the launch. As he was about to return to his house, he saw an object traveling at very high speed moving in a west- erly direction in the vicinity of the launch area. \"It looked like a sliver of brilliant green phosphorescent light just east of the contrail left by the rocket,\" Peek said. \"It made a sort of S-turn in and around the contrail, became elliptical in shape as it turned, then changed into a clearly defined disc. Peek hastily aimed his 35mm camera fitted with a 135mm lens at the object and took a picture. The disc vanished towards the south. He quickly took a couple more shots but was not sure he got the object. When his color film re- turned from the processors, he saw that he had been more successful than he thought. His first shot shows a light green blur across the trans- parency, but the second shows not one object, but three of them. Peek said the brilliance of the objects was not due to reflected sunlight, but came from the objects themselves. • 1970 About 11:30 a.m. on the seventh, residents in the village of MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 268 August 1990"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 Saladare, Ethiopia, about 14 kilometers from Asmara, heard a loud noise coming from the direction of the nearby forest which sounded like a low flying airplane. The noise in- creased to an earsplitting volume, and the villagers saw a red glowing ball which swept through the village destroying houses in its path. It uprooted trees, burned grass, but didn't cause fires. When it left the village it melted the asphalt on the road in an area measuring two by seven meters, and smashed through the stone wall of the bridge. It traveled another 150 meters toward a hillside where it became stationary, then hovered above the ground for a few seconds. Then the ball started to move again, toward the village, following the same route or parallel to it. On its way back it destroyed other houses and disappeared almost in the same direc- tion it came from. The total distance it had traveled was about six kilo- meters and lasted about 10 minutes. Inhabitants of a nearby village said it moved overhead with an earsplitting sound. The ball injured eight people, killed one child, damaged or des- troyed a total of 50 buildings. Tin roofs were crumpled and melted. The weather was clear and bright. • 1975 The crews and passengers of several charter fishing boats located over a semi-circle about 10 miles in diameter on the Pacific Ocean — about 35 miles west of Grays Harbor, Washington — observed a huge silver, cylindrical-shaped craft hover- ing about 2000 feet over the surface of the water at 8 a.m. on the 30th. The vehicle, estimated to be as long as a Boeing 747 airliner, remained stationary for about four minutes, then turned up end and went into a high speed vertical climb and disap- peared into a clear blue sky. LETTERS ... Dear Editor: Each month the sceptical British scan the pages of the excellent MUFON Journal in the hope of see- ing some tangible proof that the ETH (or indeed any other alien hypothesis) is any closer. Sadly we are always disappointed. Why, I don't know. Maybe our rose-tinted spectacles need cleaning, perhaps we're listen- ing to the wrong kind of witnesses over here, or perhaps we just don't believe hard enough (and you know what the Queen in Alice in Wonderland said about belief). But this month's piece of non-evidence was, as they say, 'a doozy.' In John Schuessler's article, \"The Implant Enigma\" (June 1990 issue), we are treated to over 800 words waf- fling about the memories and beliefs people have about the possibility of aliens implanting artifacts sub- cutaneously. These 800 words built up to nothing other than a \"most in- triguing\" quote from Nature magazine in which a strange object was found in chromosone preparations during a medical procedure. As swiftly as he mentions it, Schuessler backs off with \"it is hardly the intent of this brief monologue to argue ...whether or not implants ex- ist.\" Why bother then, why bring in the strange case from Nature if it is not to at least suggest to people that this may be such an alien artifact? To get to the point, had Schuessler done his research properly he would have seen, in Nature, Oct. 23 and Oct. 30, 1986, further discussion of this case wherein the object was iden- tified as a Diatom skeleton (dictionary def.: \"any group of unicellular algae having a heavily silicified cell wall...\"), which are quite common. This infor- mation was certainly printed in at least one US UFO publication and in UFO BRIGANTIA, which I edit. Sloppy articles and even sloppier research, even when presented with caveats, lead people, especially in the UFO field, to believe at the drop of a hat. Implant stories do exist in ufolore, but as no more than stories (they also exist in almost every folklore and tribal lore in the world - aliens? I don't think so!), so let's please treat them as such, and not try to im- pute reality from misperceptions or folktales. If we did this, ufology would be in \\ a better state than it is in now. Another question begged by Schuessler's arti- cle is where did he get the Nature ar- y . tide from in the first place without see- ing the subsequent statements? I could be wrong, but I would suspect v he got it from that most incestuous of belief breeding grounds, another UFO magazine, as it appeared in one of the US UFO publications a few years back, also without a follow up. I rest my case. — Andy Roberts Brighouse, UK Dear Editor: I was interested to read Jim Dear- dorff's letter to the MUFON UFO Journal concerning the crop circles phenomenon (March 1990). In response I enclose a list of 32 mete- orologists and atmospheric physicists whose opinions I have canvassed concerning this phenomenon. Thir- teen of these meteorologists accept a meteorological explanation without question while a further 12 are at least prepared to consider a weather-based solution without the blind dogma be- ing attached to the phenomenon by supporters of the alien intelligence theory. So far I have found only three meteorologists who completely reject a meteorological explanation for the phenomenon and who dismiss the crop circles as an endearing hoax. It seems clear, however, that like An- drews & Delgado these three meteorologists dismiss Meaden's ex- planation by rejecting the wrong meteorological theory! A further four meteorologists suspended judgement while awaiting further evidence. Despite Deardorff's claim that Cir- cular Evidence is \"superior\" to Mea- den's book, The Circles Effect and its Mysteries, we now have more than a dozen eyewitness accounts of rotating MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 268 August 1990"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"21 humming mechanisms creating crop circles at hill slope sites (as predicted by Meaden's theory), and we can cor- relate actual circle formations with the passage of weak frontal systems across circle sites. These accounts are described in our new book Crop Circles, A Mystery Solved, where we apply Meaden's exciting new theory to account for the unexplained UFO data. Although Deardorff claims that nine of his colleagues at Oregon State University rejected Meaden's theory we wonder whether Deardorff described these eyewitness accounts to his colleagues and whether or not he expected them to judge a theory without a full examination of the evidence? The crop circles are a challenging subject that is being cynically manipulated by the mass media to promote a myth. Andrews & Delgados' work has already ensured that the UFOlogists will never be able to gain a scrap of credit for our response to the crop circles and their promotion of the phenomenon has put the UFOlogist's work back by another 40 years. Their unsupport- able claim that the affected crop only carries on growing \"horizontally\" is just one of countless blunders and er- rors of fact that they have made in their \"definitive\" book. — Paul Fuller BUFORA, UK life, so many corners of the country and so many different areas of the world. Thanks so much. — Shirley & George Coyne Flushing, MI Dear Editor: John Schuessler's article, \"The Im- plant Engima,\" in the June 1990 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal aroused my curiousity. Specifically, the \"most intriguing\" report from the September 25, 1986 issue of Nature about a tiny \"fragmented crossword\" particle ap- pearing on a chromosome slide seemed like something worth check- ing out. The unstated implication of your article was that this might be part of an implant, a chunk of some ex- traterrestrial device which wound up under the microscope. MUFON's duplicated photo of the object lacked detail, so I got the original Nature article for a better look at it. It does definitely look like part of a crossword, or a piece of graph paper with some squares blacked in. My first thought was that it likely was a hoax, possibly a prank engineered by the lab technicians. After a little reflection, I began looking through subsequent issues of Nature for any follow-up letters to the magazine ex- plaining what it might be. Sure enough, they published several, both in the October 23, 1986 and the Oc- tober 30, 1986 issues. The consen- sus of the writers was that the object was a piece of the silica skeleton of a diatom, which possess that kind of regular square pattern. Blacked-in squares may have been caused by air bubbles retained during the process of mounting the slide. The source could have been lab equipment, since diatomite is used in lab filters and in the manufacture of rubber goods. For your reference, I enclose Xerox copies from all three issues of Nature. No doubt you've gotten a number of letters containing the above informa- tion already. Personally, I prefer the extraterrestrial explanation, but Phil Klass needs something like this to argue over. — Rich Clark Berkeley, CA Current Case Log Dan Wright, Investigations Dear Editor: We would appreciate it if we could use this means to express our feelings regarding our having the Proceedings of the 1990 MUFON Symposium dedicated to us. We see this as a great honor since we have been active in the field for such a short time: Seven years that have flown by so fast it is hard for us to realize. We have had an inner satisfaction of believing we have done our best to further MUFON's aims. To receive the recognition from our peers for that ef- fort means so much to us.

While watching TV, she noticed an anomaly approaching slowly over a nearby apartment building. In the shape of a slightly ovoid hamburger bun, the entire object was deep red, mixed with blue. She ran back to the bedroom calling to her companion. Together, they watched it change to a pinkish color as it turned away. Before receding from view, it chang- ed again to a white glow.

A woman was driving when she noticed something circling one of the reactor towers of the Fermi II nuclear power plant. It then approached, dropping \"sparks,\" and paced low over her car momentarily before moving to her rear and eventually out of sight. The ob- ject was described as jetliner-sized, and made up of (a) a solid central portion, roughly circular, and partly outlined in small white lights, and (b) V-shaped, with translucent wings, also outlined in white lights. Two large spptlights were at the front. She stopped her car and watched the same or an identical object dropping sparks for several more minutes in the distance. Total duration was estimated as 15 minutes.

A couple was crossing north over the Bay Bridge when they spotted an ob- ject ahead and to the east near the Pensacola shoreline. It was described as a long isoceles triangle with a centered red light on the bottom and pairs of white lights at the three apexes. Immediately, they could neither see nor hear the other autos and pedestrians along the bridge. As they neared the end of the bridge, the object crossed over their earlier path to the west. .They turned west also Continued on next page The Night Sky Walter N. Webb September 1990 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Rising in the NE about 10 PM daylight time in midmonth, Mars moves eastward between the Hyades (face of the Bull Taurus) and the Pleiades. Mars increases its brightness still farther, from -0.4 to -0.9 magnitude, dur- ing September as the Earth catches up to its ruddy neighbor. On the night of the 24th-25th, Mars lies 4° north of the star Aldebaran; the planet is five times brighter than the star. Compare the colors of the pair. Saturn (magnitude 0.4), in Sagittarius, is low in the sky east of south at dusk. The yellowish ringed planet slides westward during the evening hours. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): In late September and early October, Mercury has its best morning appearance of the year/This nearest world to the Sun may be glimpsed very low in the east at dawn. Venus (-3.9) becomes increasingly hard to see low in the east, rising ! J /4 hours before the Sun early in the month and then later vanishing into the solar glare, not to reappear (in the evening sky) until late in the year. Mars stands high in the south at dawn. Jupiter (-1.9), in Cancer, rises in the NE about 2:30 in midmonth. The giant lies very near the lunar crescent on the 15th, a beautiful sight! Saturn sets in the WSW about 1 AM in mid-September. Moon Phases: Full moon — September 4 Last quarter — September 11 New moon — September 18 First quarter — September 26 The Stars: The autumnal equinox heralds the arrival of the rather dim fall constella- tions in the east. Nevertheless, it shouldn't be too difficult to find the Great Square of Pegasus, as much a symbol of autumn as the Summer Triangle is of summer. The square is large, measuring very roughly 15° on each side. Pegasus was the famous Winged Horse in mythology. Several lines of stars that branch from the western side of the square form the head, neck, and front legs of the horse which is flying upside-down. What looks like the hind legs of the animal is really the adjoining constella- tion Andromeda the Princess. The NE corner of the square, the star Alpheratz, actually is the head of Andromeda, while two strings of stars ex- tending outward form her gown. Noteworthy telescopic objects this month during midevening hours are, in the NE, the Double Cluster of Perseus and the Andromeda Galaxy; in the south and SW, the Dumbbell Nebula (in Vulpecula), Ring Nebula (Lyra), and the array of Sagittarius objects discussed in the June issue; and finally the Hercules Globular Cluster in the west.
