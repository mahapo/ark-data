The Condon team ha9 completf acces to the files of Project Blue Book, the Air Force office for UFO investigations. There are over 15,000 UFO reports in its files-- about 20 percent of thiese sightings truly unidentified. Maj. Hector Quintanilla Jr., director of Blue Book, says CondonPs aides have asked for only about 400 case histories of the older saucer sightings. These are the classic cases that have been extensively written about in UFO literature. Although Project Blue Book continues to investigate saucers, it gets nothing in return from Condon's team. .:It's a one-way street,\" Quintanilla says. \"I donvt want to bias him in any way, so I don't request anyting frm him. .: Dondon and his aides have conferred with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, chairman of Northwestern Univeristyqs Department of Astronomy and Scientific Consultant to Project Blue Book, who has looked into many of the Air Force's most puzzling casses. They also questioned ~ir Force acientific adviser Jacques Vallee on the methodology employed in Project Blue Rookq: investigations . The conferences were followed by a meeting last June at the University of Colorado, which was attended by about 100 of the 140 Air F {orce CFO investigating officers--every base has one to tighten report procedures in an attempt to gain a more scientfic description of saucars' sightings. Condon has not confined his inquiries to Air Force and scientfic personnel.. He also has called in some of the Air ForcePs severest critics to get their views on saucers. Of'fi- cers of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NIcAP) , an organization that believes therls something to flying sauc ers, have visited Boulder to submit evidence. Retired Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe and Richard J. Hall, N:CCAP1s top officials, have occasionally consulted with Condon s group to review the organizationqs documented sightings.

City that heard many of the way out believers and :'contacteesi7 (those whc claim to have , contacted crews from outer space). One of the speakers at the Congres was Vi-Venus, who claimed she was from the planet after which she was named. Hall says this type gives serious suacer researchers a black eye and NICAP bycotted the New York congress. However willing the Colorado researchers are to consider even bizarre \"evidence,:' they are seriously attempting to zero In on UFOos in a scientific manner. They are especially anxious to investigate current casses that can be observed from start to finish. One of their biggest accomplishments is the establishment of a team of trained in- vestigators around the country, who can get to the scene of any importanb UFO sighting within 24 hours with cameras and other equipment. The Condon group also hope police depart- ments whill make efforts to get photos of UFODs that can be scientifically analyzed. They have devised a meticulous questionnaire ? for saucer reporters to fill out--size, shape, color, motion, and other characteristics. The answers are fed into a computer and the scien- tists hope eventually to discover additional patterns of saucer pehnomena . The Colorado investigators follow up the questionnaires with phone calls to the persons from whom a reports originate. If they can- not carlify a report in a phone conversation, and the sighting is deemed of sufficient im- portance, investigators go to the scne to check it out. & De on the Scene. Some casses yield solutions easily when investigators get a first hand look at the scene. In a recent Conneticut sighting, for example, a :'glowing objectn turned out to be an electrical arc, created when the wet branches of trees slapped against, and short-circuited, a power line. But other cases continue to puzzle investi- gators. Two of Condonvs team recently travelled to the Winnnipeg, Canada, area to investigate a weird story of a man 'burned by the exhaust of a saucer.\" The victim claimed he spotted a strange, saucer-like vehicle in a clearing as he wlalked through the bush. When he approached the vehicle, he heard vocal sounds coming from inside. He peered in the open hatxh and the vehicle suddenly took off in a vertical climb, erattting a jet exhaust that burned fcoht. im on Page Five)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"PAGE FIE3 SKY LOOK PAGZ FI!E by mid 1968 when preparing the report--cer- SAUCER CHASES C.4R -- CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1 tain to be a best seller--will begin. bP the object, which they estimated to be 40 to 50 feet round.

Other sightings were reported in Summerdale ( a UFO hovering over a house), Rutherford Heights, Regina St., and throughout the West Shore area between Camp Hill 'and Carlisle and up into Perry County. The sightings were investigated by Cook and NICAF' sub-committee members: Col. Robert B. Willingham and Robert L. Rineard, both of Mechanicsburg, and Ivan Kerns and John W. Steigieman dr., both of Carlisle. Cook said he had statements from 42 persons who witnesses UF3's on Friday and Saturday Before the report is realsed to the public, it wiii be reviewed by a special committee of the Natioml Academy of Sciences. They will check the Condon groupPs scientific methods and determine whether their conclusions are scientifically valid. After the Academy apprpves the report, it will be made public. Will Anything be Held Back? The Air - Force answer is that the report will not be classified. The Condon group is pledged to withhold any data on classified aircraft or missles it might come across in its investi- gations, but an Air Force spokesman says ;'Everyone knows practically everything we ahve now. '' Can you trust the upcoming Condon Rep~nt? The editors of POPULAR SCIENCE believe -You can.

The task of science is, precisely, the obligation to distinguish between the blse and the true. Thcs, if science considres flyiiq saucers a hall~cinatio.n, it still .must explain the cause of the 'global psychic illness. That nlay well be as difficult to establish as the true nature of UFOs. The wcll-known American astrophysicist a3nal.d -bnzcl says that flying saucers are optical phenmna in the Earth's atmosphere. Because of Professor Wnzcl's scientific prestige the explanation is generally zccept- el. But it does not hold water. As soon as vie go on frm this generalization to concre~ i~?tcrpretations of 'concrete observatior-; it b-.comcs evident that UFOs will not r .'i-c +hcmselves to optical phcnmna of L L rikragc, Minkow or halo typc. Try the Wnzel expla- nation on the four accounts we citkd carlier. Nothing intelligible will mge. What we sea to kc deali~g with hcre is a kid of reality still unocplorcd. Thc appearance of iXs is almost always accompanied by a lumincsccncc of air and the formation of an atmspheric plasm. This fact is thc basis for thc \"plasma\" hypothesis of UIVs as accumulations of atmospheric plasm of the &ill lighrning typc. But this cxpla- nation dccs rot hold up either. Ball light- n.ing is always a product of thunderstorms, ad thc appearance of UFOs has no relation to mather, Ball lightning diameters as a rule run four to fivc inchcs, no lxger; the dimtcrs of flying discs arc tnes ad cvcn h~mdrds of times that size. The bchavior of Ul'Os, their shapes and othcr physical pro- pcrtics arc quite different frm what w kncx11 of ball lightning. Saucers and Balls. To find a clue to the nature of UFOs, LE must study all thc reports on these surprising and, to my mind, rcal objects. Only a scientific analysis will re- veal the truth.What is, hwcvcr, clear al- ready is that UQ phencmcmn can bc objec- tively analyzcd and classifid. T1-E UFO classification adopt& by foreign invcsti- gators is also confirnu3 by Smict obswers. By day when obsmcd frm Earth or planes, UFOs zppcar as bright discs with a metallic tmge. Assistant Professor Vyachcslav Zaitscv observcd such a flying saucer in 1964, above Eologoyc7 from a TU-104 aircraft mtking a scheduld flight. The huge bright mctal disc slid under the liner' s belly, madc a turn ad at sac distance took a course parallcl with the aircraft. A b .lging core resembling a cabin could be seen in the heart of the disc. After flying al.ongsidc the plane for scvc-ral seconds, it swerved abruptly disappeared.
