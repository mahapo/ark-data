Event Duration: About 7 minutes Event Location: Wylatowo. Poland Interviewed by: Nancy Talbott on July 31,2003\" . Video Operator: Milosz Kuss Translator: Slawek Paruszewski I n the early morning of July 22,2000, Jerzy Szpulecki, a farmer in this rur- al area of central Poland, was work- ing late at night on a new house he was building on the edge of a wheat field farmed by his neighbor, Tadeusz Filipczak. At 12:15 AM the lights in his house sud- denly went out, and he came downstairs to check for a shorted circuit or other pos- sible cause. As he reached the first floor he could see, through the large windows in the front of the house, that all of the street-lights on the nearby road were also out, and that there were no lights in houses nearby. Almost immediately he then saw a \"strange\" red light in the sky coming down very slowly toward the field in front of his house. The light was a very bright red, spherical in shape, and about 65 ft. in di- ameter. When first seen, it was about 1500 feet above the trees on the left side of the field. As the light came closer he saw what looked like a turbulent and rotating misty \"white fog\" above the red light which, as the object descended about 250 feet out in the field and directly in front of his win- dows, then appeared to be \"some type of craft.\" As it got closer it banked at an angle and continued to descend to the field, but very very slowly. At this point the glow- ing, bright red sphere seemed to be an outer shell of some sort, surrounding an inner white mass of fog, which was constantly swirling or rotating within the red sphere. As this strange object got closer to the ground it began to enlarge into a much big- Drawing by Szpulecki of a brilliant red, slowly moving object, with rotating white fog-like material inside, as it came across the road & over the field. ger, but still round, object and seemed to \"discharge something into the air around it.\" Szpulecki says that he thinks the \"craft\" was the \"color of the white mist\" (mean- ing that there was a white foggy material swirling around an actual solid craft, all of which was now inside the red sphere). He also had the impression that the sur- rounding red shell was \"driving\" the ob- ject inside. As the object descended to about 60 feet above the ground he began to notice a \"pressure\" on his body, and as it got close to the ground sparks erupted, \"like a short- circuit. When it touched down there were brilliant flashes, like lightning.\" And as it landed, multiple \"arms\" sud- denly extended out of the center of the ob- ject, slowly bending down to the ground. At this point the red glow became so bright \"it was hard to watch because it hurt my eyes.\" . There seemed to be four of these \"arms\" (tentacle-like protrusions, which angled down toward the ground), and which were all the same length and bluish in color- and on the ends of each of the \"arms\" there was an even brighter, round, violet-colored light-ball. These violet light-balls were the bright- est part of the whole object and were \"very difficult to watch\" because the brightness hurt his eyes. Szpulecki was not completely certain about the number of these protruding arms, saying first that there were four of them, but later saying there may have been five or six. His primary impression, though, was that there were only four. At this point the witness noticed that there were at least three cars stopped on the road next to the field, their occupants apparently also watching the object. The next day he heard from other villagers that \"many\" people had seen the glowing red ball of light as it crossed the sky heading toward the field. .Szpulecki reports that the object sat touching the ground for \"at least a minute,\" with sparks flying and giving off an intense light, and that it was during this time that he became aware of a physical \"pressure\" on his body. This sensation of something pressing on his body, and particularly on his head, was noticed most as the \"arms\" were extended from the object as it settled down to the ground. Even though only the top half of his body was exposed to the windows, he is sure that he felt this strong pressure all over. He reported no typical electromagnetic July 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"effects (such as the hair on his arms, or back of his neck rising), and did not have a headache. He states that he smelled noth- ing unusual and heard no sound at all dur- ing the entire episode. On an instinctual level he was certain that this \"energy\" (as evidenced by both the brilliant light being given off by the object, and the pressure on his body) was not harmful to people. After what the witness states was about a minute, the protruding arms retracted and the object, whose white swirling center continued to rotate constantly inside the red outer shell, rose into the air a few meters, and then descended into the field again a \"short distance\" away. Again the \"arms\" (with the brilliant vio- let spheres of light on the ends) protruded out of the object, bending down to the ground, and again he felt a very strong pres- sure on his body, particularly on his head. \"Many sparks\" also accompanied this second landing of the object, but this time Szpulecki states that they were \"returning to the mist\" instead of coming from it-that the sparks were coming up to the object from the ground. Finally, after sitting on the ground this second time for about a minute, the arms again retracted and the \"red shell closed in again around the white center\" so that all he could see at this point was the red ball of light. The whole object started to rise, becom- ing smaller in overall size as it rose. Its red glow, \"like a brilliant sunset,\" became so intense that it lit up the room in which the witness was standing. Slowly, it sim- ply drifted away across the fields and dis- appeared in the distance. Szpulecki esti- mates the amount of time that had elapsed from when he first saw the object to when it disappeared as about 7 minutes. While interviewing Szpulecki (and on the videotape), it was apparent that he was still markedly moved by his recollection of this experience three years earlier. Since the electricity in the house was still out Szpulecki went back upstairs to retrieve his wristwatch before returning to his home and discovered that it had stopped at 12:15 AM, the time when he believed the power had been interrupted. Because it was obvious that the wheat field was not on fire, and because he had never heard of a crop circle (and therefore didn't think to check the field for one), he returned to his home in the village. The next morning a neighbor, whose house also faces the field in which the ob- ject had landed, informed Szpulecki that there was a strange marking in the wheat ABOVE: Szpulecki's new house with unobstructed view of large wheat fields in front. Houses nearby also lost electric power during, and after, the incident. (Photo by Nancy Talbott) BELOW: Szpulecki's drawing of landed object.

A diagram by Ewaryst Zylkowski of the circle is at the lower right. field-a pictogram-style crop circle which was, as it turned out, flattened into the wheat in the precise location where the amazing object had landed the night be- fore. Furthermore, the design of this picto- gram (described by the neighbor as \"some- thing like a cross\") was strikingly similar to the witness' description of the strange object itself with its \"arms\" extended, end- ing in the smaller violet light spheres on the ends of each arm. In another field on the north side of the road (only a few meters away) an addi- tional 60-foot-diameter ringed circle was also found. Both men struggled to grasp the significance of the symbols, but were unable to understand the meaning of the signs. To our knowledge this is the only re- port of its type in the crop circle literature, the only time in which the landing of such a complex visual object has resulted in a crop circle which appears to replicate, in the laid crop, the observed geometic as- pects of the object itself. It is also the first eyewitness account of a crop circle forming in Wylatowo, al- though in 1973 a flattened circle was re- ported in the village of Zabno, about 5 km away, which was created by a \"metallic, disc-shaped object\" descending into a rye field there. It should probably be reiterated, how- ever, that none of the Wylatowo residents we interviewed knew about this earlier event in Zabno, nor of the crop circle phe- nomenon generally, prior to Szpulecki's experience in 2000. It was Szpulecki's neighbor (who did not witness the events of the night before) who first found the Wylatowo crop circle and who told Szpulecki the morning after the event. He also presented the information that the electricity throughout the area was not working, and that many local trucks and cars also had dead batteries. Later in the day the power company began working to repair the electric lines, reporting that the power was out in the entire area. They apparently were never able to figure out the source of the power failure. And over the next week or so it was learned that all the vehicles (cars, trucks, July 2004 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"tractors) within about a 1500-foot area around the field also had battery failure. Reports began to surface from other people who had seen the object while it was in the air, but it may be that Szpulecki was the only eyewitness to its actual de- scent and landing-at least the only local witness. It is unlikely that the vehicles which he saw stopped on the road next to the field were driven by locals (most of whom are farmers who are usually in bed by this time), and it is thought instead that they were driven by tradesmen traveling long distances through the night. Whether these vehicles were stopped because of battery failure is not known. Szpulecki does not remember if they were still present when he finally went home after the incident. Two or three other crop circles were eventually discovered in the Wylatowo area during the summer of 2000, and in subsequent summers the phenomenon has continued to produce crop formations in these same Wylatowo fields (and in a few other areas of Poland). These seem to be both thematically similar to the original cross-like design found in 2000 and to exhibit a specific overall design character unique to Polish crop circles. On June 27,2001, a crop formation was again found in exactly the same location where Szpulecki had seen the firey red ob- ject land in 2000. This formation was a good deal more complex in design, and ap- peared to be an elaboration upon the origi- nal cross pattern. In the second half of July, 2002, Milosz Kuss, a local boy from a village not too far from Wylatowo, discovered a crop circle in his uncle's fields. Milosz' family, like others in this re- mote region, had experienced several highly unusual events themselves over the past several years (one of which is detailed in BLT Report \"UFO Incident & Trace Analysis, Golabki, Poland-1998,\" posted on the Jeff Rense website at www.rense.com/general49/blt.htm) Milosz had heard reports of the Wylatowo crop circles. His drawing (at right) of the 2002 circle on his uncle's farm almost exactly replicates the object which Szpulecki described landing in Wylatowo in 2000. The crop circle phenomenon, by itself, is an ongoing mystery. Peer-reviewed sci- entific research (see \"Published Papers\" @ www.bltresearch.com) on a variety of plant and soil changes found in crop circles provides strong evidence that the majority June 27, 2001, formation, found not only in the same field, but in exactly the same spot as the original 2000 event. The design here is similar to the \"cross- like \" crop circle of 2000, but is considerably more elaborate.

Alzofon Copyright 2004 by Frederick E. Alzofon Ash and Hewitt in Refl claim (author's comments are in square brackets): \"The real problem with UFOs [and crop circles] is not a shortage of evidence, but rather the absence of any scientific expla- nation for their existence and behavior. It is diffi- cult if not impossible to accommodate UFOs [and crop circles] in ex- isting scientific think- ing.\" It is the purpose of this article to show how both UFOs and crop circles can be explained as two aspects of a single tech- nology: the control of the gravitational field, i.e. the ability to either de- crease or increase the gravitational force acting on any object. The technology can be reproduced with existing and readily available instrumen- tation. A principal difference between terres- trial and alien use of the technology is the lesser power available for the terrestrial version. In principle this difference can be eliminated. It will follow that if crop circle genera- tion can be instrumented, it will constitute a demonstration of the validity of the UFO phenomenon. The unifying technology, moreover, can be explained in readily understandable terms: there is no need to use highly ab- Dr.Frederick Alzofon stract or complex theories. In addition, with off-the-shelf equip- ment, one can generate phenomena simi- lar to those associated with UFO and crop circle observations: a decrease or an in- crease in the gravitational force. With a small investment in learning the meaning of a few unfamil- iar terms, the lack of under- standing the UFO and crop circle phenomena can be traded for what promises to be a basic insight into the origin of these phenomena, and the possibility of fur- ther development of a new technology. If the proposed models for the phenomena prove to be correct, then there will no longer be an impen- etrable alien mystery: the aliens will have been dem- onstrating the new technol- ogy for many years. The technology To understand how gravitation can be weakened or strengthened, it is only nec- essary to understand a simple analogy with how some materials can be cooled using a magnetic field. Paramagnetic salts are composed of molecules that are very small magnets. If a magnetic field is applied to such materi- als, these molecular magnets line up in the direction of the magnetic field. During the alignment, the salt will heat up somewhat. If we wait until the material cools off (the magnetic field is still ap- plied) and then quickly remove the mag- netic field, the salt's surroundings will cool to a temperature lower than it had been before the magnetic field was applied. This is because the heat energy of the surroundings becomes depleted in the pro- cess of disorienting the oriented molecu- lar magnets. It is worthwhile to examine the foregoing process more closely: In general, heat is essentially the ran- dom motion of molecules composing ma- terials. If the chaotic motion of the mol- ecules is reduced, the temperature of the material falls. If the chaotic motion in- creases, the temperature rises. In the cooling process described above, when the molecular magnets move into the oriented state they give an extra kick to the chaotic motion of the molecules and to their chaotic energy. Their orientation per- sists while they are otherwise moving ran- domly. Because of the added energy, the tem- perature of the salt rises. The extra heat is eventually lost to the surroundings in con- tact with the salt. If the magnetic field is now quickly re- moved, the molecular magnets preserve their orientation along the former direction of the magnetic field until the jostling they receive from the chaotic motion of the sur- roundings disorients them. In so doing, the surroundings loses some of its energy and its temperature drops. The above described process is called \"cooling of paramagnetic salts by adiabatic demagnetization.\" The two effects, the heating and cool- ing, are closely analogous to the process used for UFO propulsion and the genera- tion of crop circles. Cooling of the surroundings corresponds Dr. Frederick Alzofon has an A.B. in math with a minor in physics from the U of California, LA; the M.A. in physics from the U of California, Berkeley; and the Ph.D. in math from the U of Califor- nia, Berkeley.

Page 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"to a decrease in the gravitational force and heating corresponds to an increase of the gravitational force. To carry out the analogy, we first have to select a suitable material. Instead of ori- enting molecular magnets, we will be ori- enting nuclear magnets (according to the model of the gravitational field presented in Reference 2). The nuclear orientation, in turn, will orient a cloud of electrical particles sur- rounding the nucleus; this cloud is held to be responsible for the origin of the gravi- tational force. The atomic nucleus is smaller than the atom by a factor of 100,000. Aluminum and magnesium Reference to a table of nuclear magnetic properties shows that two prime candidates can play a role analogous to a paramag- netic salt: aluminum and magnesium. Their nuclei are strongly magnetic. Aluminum is the more promising choice since it is a better structural material and less flammable in air than magnesium. (Ref. 2) There is a difference between the kinds of choices for magnetic materials used in dynamic nuclear orientation and adiabatic demagnetization. It is found that inclusion of small amounts of ferromagnetic ele- ments in aluminum, for example, will in- crease the efficiency of the process. (Ref. 3) Typical ferromagnetic elements that can be used are iron and chromium. It is com- mented at this point that when some UFOs are viewed by reflected light, they exhibit the appearance of aluminum, or a gray color like iron or a sheen like chromium (Ref. 4, p. 20), although these are not the only colors which have been observed. There is another difference: it is impor- tant to minimize heating effects in dynamic nuclear orientation. One way of doing this is to use alumi- num in very finely divided form: composed of particles with a diameter of the order of a millionth of a meter. In some experiments performed under my direction, the combi- nation of aluminum and iron was in the form of particles of this size. UFOs have same problem In practice, it was found that apparatus heating was also a problem. Both of these problems appear to occur for UFOs also (Ref. 4, p. 127). It is significant that when samples of a UFO that disintegrated into flaming pieces were collected, they were found to be composed of magnesium (Ref. 4, p. 127). To cause the nuclei of aluminum (for example) to become oriented, it is not enough to apply a constant magnetic field. This method has been studied, but was found to be difficult to instrument. How- ever, the orientation can be accomplished in a two-step method. First a magnetic field is applied to a given specimen; this causes the electrons in orbit around the aluminum nuclei to pre- cess around the direction of the magnetic field. The strength of the field is held very constant. The frequency of the precession is determined by the strength of the mag- netic field and is called the \"Larmor fre- quency.\" The desired precession.can also be in- duced by rotating aluminum about an axis. This method of causing precession is not emphasized in the present discussion, but is mentioned because a sound like a \"loud turbine\" has been reported associated with a UFO (Ref. 4., p. 43). Crop circle creation The generation of a constant magnetic field is more convenient an explanation for our purpose, since it figures in the creation of crop circles. It was also more convenient for pur- poses of experiments performed under the direction of the writer: in the experiments the strength of the field was about 3000 gauss and the Larmor frequency was about 9500 megahertz. This frequency is in the microwave X band. Ref. 4 reports observations of a UFO emitting radiation of this frequency (p. 96). Evidence of a magnetic field accompany- ing UFOs has been reported (Ref. 4, p. 53). Once the electrons circulating about the aluminum nucleus have been set to process- ing, it takes a relatively small magnetic field applied at the Larmor frequency to tip the electrons over and cause them to become oriented. This process is analogous to causing a child's swing to gain large amplitudes of swings if a periodic force is applied to it which matches its natural oscillation fre- quency. The latter oscillatory magnetic field is supplied by a microwave generator, and is oriented so that the magnetic field is ap- plied at right angles to the constant mag- netic field. Such microwave radiation has frequently been observed in the presence ofaUFO(Ref.4,p.96). Having generated the microwave radia- tion, we would expect the UFO to be de- signed to radiate it away. Moreover, the occupants of the vehicle would need to be protected from the harm- ful effects of the radiation; hence the double-walled construction of UFOs, as Teleportation of vehicles, as in this case from Kentucky, has been reported in several UFO encounters. sometimes reported, and what appears to be protective clothing in some reports (Ref. 4, p. 114). Once the electrons have been oriented, they penetrate close to the nuclei of the alu- minum atoms and cause them to become oriented. This, in turn, causes the cloud of charged particles about the nuclei to be- come oriented. The orientation process takes place very quickly (in microseconds), and when the microwave field is turned off the orienta- tion is allowed to decay under the interac- tion with the gravitational field. The latter process occurs in about 6 mil- liseconds for aluminum at room tempera- ture (about 20 degr. C), although only about two-thirds of the nuclei become unoriented in this time interval (Ref. 5, p. 83). An undulating flight path The alternation of microwave on/off cycles gives rise to the undulating flight path often remarked upon (Ref. 4, p. 87). However, the remaining one-third of oriented nuclei after each cycle of orienta- tion and relaxation builds up a cumulative effect, so that eventually there is a large population of oriented nuclei, and the num- ber that are relaxing at any given moment becomes very large. This effect enhances the loss of weight and explains why there is sometimes a de- lay in launching a UFO off the ground. In any case, having satisfied the require- ments of the model described above, ex- periments were performed under the di- Page8 MUFON UFO Journal July 2004"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"Insectoid crop circle in California. rection of the author, and the alternating increase and decrease in the gravitational force on specimens of aluminum, as well as the cumulative effect, were observed (pat. pending). Along with the delay in lift-off, there is often a rotation of some part of the UFO that increases during this interval. This is to be expected, since the precession of the electrons reacts on the vehicle to give it a rotation in an opposite direction, and this must be compensated in some way. A similar effect occurs due to the rota- tion of helicopter vanes. Reducing the weight of the UFO is not enough to propel it (the short interval of gravitational force increase, corresponding to the heating analogy, has not been dis- cussed, since it is much weaker than the loss of weight effect). Variety of propulsions There are a variety of ways the propul- sion can be accomplished. For example, the oscillating electric currents used to generate the microwave fields can be led through coils with adjust- able orientation. The interaction of the elec- tric current and the Earth's magnetic field will generate a force to drive the UFO in any desired direction. Compressed gases released through valves on the skin of the vehicle can also be used to drive the UFO. There is another factor which has been omitted above: the theory guiding this analysis (Ref. 2) not only predicts a re- duction in the gravitational force, but also a reduction in the mass of the vehicle. This feature implies that there will be large accelerations with small forces ap- plied. Since the effects described are due to a field, the inhabitants of the vehicle will also have a reduced mass, and the effect of large accelerations will not be harmful. In any case, very large velocities for such a vehicle can be expected. UFOs evidently are capable of gener- ating large amounts of power. Ref. 4 re- ports large amounts of radiated power: of the order of millions of watts (p. 98), i.e. comparable to the amount of power devel- oped by a diesel locomotive. With so much power available, why not use it to communicate with terrestrials in a manner that cannot be ignored? Crop circle generation To make a crop circle, the inverse of the gravitational reduction process can be employed. That is, in the analogy to heat- ing of a paramagnetic salt, the heating part of the heating/cooling cycle is emphasized, rather than the cooling part of the cycle. Ref. 5, p. 4, indicates that iron has the desired properties: the orientation interval is much longer than that for relaxation. It should be remarked that, since an in- creased gravitational force acts upon all matter, not just upon plants, we would ex- pect to see its effects on other materials in the crop-growing fields. Indeed, flattened animals have been found in the crop circle area (Ref. 6), as well as an increased crys- tallization in the soil, associated with com- pression and heating (Ref. 7). Once having chosen iron particles, very finely divided to reduce heating effects, there is a problem of delivery of the par- ticles. They would have to be delivered from a low altitude above the fields in or- der to avoid being dispersed by the wind. This implies considerable activity over the fields before the crop circle is formed. It is easy to imagine that the small lights often reported over the fields prior to crop circle formation are the agents for spread- ing the iron dust (Ref. 6). These lights are similar to the \"foo fight- ers\" observed by aircraft personnel during World War II; they are apparently unoc- cupied drone vehicles controlled remotely. The microwave radiation figuring in the process of the preceding section, and ap- plied here for the inverse process, will heat the iron particles, but the heating will be confined to small regions within the par- ticles. There is ample evidence that the heat developed in the iron particles is enough to melt them. Surface tension then causes the molten metal to gather into particles of varying sizes, up to about 50 micrometers (Refs 6 and 8). Although the temperature required to melt iron is 1535 deg. C, the size of the particles is so small that the amount of power required to melt the iron particle is no more than about ten millionths of a watt. However, spread out over a crop circle of typical size, about eighty feet in diam- eter, the total amount of power required is of the order of megawatts. The heating effect is not confined to iron particles: it extends to pockets of moisture in crop stalks, vaporizing the water con- tent and blowing out plant nodes, as well as causing other effects related to heating (Ref. 7). The application of a microwave field by a UFO could be carried out from a much greater altitude than the covering by iron dust. In order to avoid burning the crops it would be applied for a very short time. It is also well suited for transmission from a high altitude, since it penetrates clouds and rain (Ref. 6, p. 140). The large amount of power projected would cause the atmosphere through which it passed to glow. Such columns of light have been ob- served, extending from a high altitude to the ground (Ref. 6). The swirling of the crop circle The vertical direction of the propaga- tion of the radiation causes another effect: it is well known that the energy in electro- magnetic radiation swirls about the direc- tion of propagation, and this property could cause the swirling pattern of crop stalks in the crop circles (Ref. 6, p. 47). It is evi- dent that the crop stalk swirling takes place about a vertical direction. July 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Crop circles in England are most fre- quently found in areas with underlying mineral-laden water (Ref. 6, pp 120-122). Such areas would be favorable to intensi- fication of the observed effects through re- flection of the incident radiation. The \"constant\" magnetic field required for the generation of the effects predicted by the model need not be strictly constant, since the generation of the crop circle takes place so quickly (a few seconds). A slowly varying field could be pro- jected along with the microwave radiation and need only hold its correct value for a short time. It would leave lasting magnetic field effects: such effects have been ob- served (Ref. 6, p. 125). To be sure, there are many questions left unanswered by the above list of ob- served correlations between model predic- tions and observations.These questions cannot fail to suggest many experimental tests. Conclusions The foregoing brief analysis presents a strong case for viewing UFO phenomena and crop circles as two aspects of the same physical processes, with both being gen- erated by the same agency. If the model is accepted, it not only gives coherence to the many phenomena associ- ated with both, but also legitimizes UFO phenomena, which are more difficult to observe close at hand. Witness accounts then can be judged against a more reliable standard, and not necessarily dismissed as due to poor ob- servation. References 1. D. Ash and P.

The UFO \"breathing pool\" a rare feature of abductions By Preston E. Dennett There are many strange procedures performed aboard UFOs, including physi- cal examinations, medical operations, baby presentations, emotional testing, pro- phetic warnings, and more. One of the rarest and most bizarre pro- cedures, how- ever, is known as the UFO breath- ing pool. These cases involve abductees who Preston Dennett are made to totally immerse them- selves in pools of unknown liquids. They are then firmly told to breathe the liquid into their lungs. At this point, surprisingly, the abductees report that they are able to breathe in the liquid without harm. This unique episode has only rarely been reported, and investigators are not yet sure of its meaning. For a few experiences, however, the UFO immersion pools are a vivid and ter- rifying part of their contact with extrater- restrials. David Jacobs, Ph.D., was one of the first researchers to reveal this exotic as- pect of the UFO experience. As he says, \"The aliens bring the abductee into a room with a large tank or even a small \"swim- ming pool\" in it. The aliens tell her to get into the tank. \"The liquid is clear, and at first glance looks like water, but it is not water. The abductee is told to submerge herself in the liquid and stay there. She may be scared that she will drown, but the aliens reassure her that she will be all right. \"She gets in over her head and then is told to breathe. She finds that she is able to breathe normally, even though her head is under \"water.\" After a short time she is told to get out. Sometimes the aliens dry her off, but most of the time they do not. The purpose of the pool procedure is unknown.\" What exactly are the immersion pools, and what is their purpose? An examina- tion of the few known cases reveals some startling patterns. Case one: James Austino Under hypnotic regression, James Austino recalled having this experience during an abduction in 1988. He was led by several gray-type aliens into a four- foot deep tank of liquid. He was then in- structed to \"lay back and just relax.\" At that point, James felt himself be- come submerged. As he says, \"That's when I feel like I'm going down...I just sink down to the bottom, and I start to breathe. That's the neat thing. It makes you numb, though. It feels body tem- perature. But I'm breathing, which is re- ally strange. I hear sounds under water, like mechanical sounds. I'm just kind of floating.\" James lay in the tank breathing the strange liquid for a few more moments, at one point almost losing consciousness. Eventually, he is pulled out of the pool. As he says, \"The water feels slimy now. When I come out it's still on my body; it doesn't run off like water. You have to take your hands and slop it off.\" This case was investigated by Dr. Jacobs. He doesn't list any more cases; however, he does state that he has un- covered others. Case two: Kim Carlsberg Professional photographer and abductee Kim Carlsberg has also reported this unusual experience. In fact, one of her early clues that she was having UFO experiences involved bizarre dreams of this nature-dreams of \"being underwater, and/ or breathing underwater...of choking on thick substances, like mud.\" One vivid example of this type of ex- perience, Carlsberg calls \"fluid transition.\" She explains, \"I had another haunting 'dream' about breathing liquid. This time, I woke up in a murky ocean. Peering through the cloudiness above my head, I searched for the hidden presence that kept me submerged. \"It was strange that in the face of death I was completely calm when I should have been panicking. My burning lungs begged me to inhale and end their agony. I finally let go. \"As the water poured into my lungs, my spirit rushed out of my body and rose to the surface of the ocean. From that vantage point, I was looking back down at my body and the realization hit me: I Page 10 MUFON Journal July 2004"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"was still alive and so was my body, even though I wasn't in it!\" Although Kim hasn't been able to link her dreams to a specific experience aboard a UFO, she feels that they are definitely related. Case three: Fred The complete story of the abductions of Fred is told in Karla Turner's book Into the Fringe. Like Kim Carlsberg, Fred has a long history of UFO encounters, coupled with strange dreams about being able to breathe underwater. Says. Fred, \"I was in a pool of water and I thought I was going to drown. I did not have a way out, so I tried to relax and began breathing underwater. I was shocked and didn't know what I was do- ing there.\" Although Fred never uncovered further information about this particular incident, he has explored many other similar dreams under hypnotic regression and discovered that they were based on true events. Case four: Beth Beth, of Florida, has been having ex- tensive UFO experiences all her life. She has had many conscious sightings and partial recall of abductions. Some of the recall of her abductions comes to her in dreams. One of these dreams revealed the immersion pool. As the report on the case says, \"In a different dream, Beth was made to im- merse in 'a heavy liquid' and was sur- prised to find that she could breathe in it. This scenario is so familiar now that it is often included in the list of most frequently reported abduction events.\" Case five: Mike Evans In my own research, I have only run across this type of case once. This par- ticular case involves a gentleman who has experienced numerous onboard UFO ex- periences. Starting from early childhood to the present, Evans has experienced a series of contacts with at least two dif- ferent types of ETs. He has undertaken a long journey to recall what has happened to him, using the method of regressive hypnosis. Re- cently he recalled an unusual memory of being underwater in a strange environ- ment. What was most significant for him was that he remembered being able to breathe underwater. \"I had the impression, the thought, that I could breathe underwater, that I've done it before. I remembered, I remember, breathing underwater. It was in like a glass aquarium. \"I have connected that to my UFO ex- periences because that's the only place I had the opportunity to be placed in a glass aquarium.\" Evans feels certain that this is a real memory of something that happened to him, and he was surprised to find that oth- ers report similar experiences. His case is particularly credible, as it is supported by considerable physical evidence and multiple eyewitnesses. Conclusions While the number of these cases con- tinues to grow, our understanding of them remains limited. Why are people being immersed in strange liquids? What rea- son could the aliens possibly have to per- form these bizarre experiments? Burleson's Marilyn Monroe book to be published in Brazil UFOs and the Murder of Marilyn Monroe by Dr. Don Burleson, MUFON State Director for New Mexico, has been translated into a Portuguese edition (OVNIs E O ASSASSINATO DE MARILYN MONROE) that will published in Brazil in July by a company down there called Editora MW. Says Burleson, \"With the high in- terest in UFOs in Brazil, the book should do pretty well there.\" July 2004 MUFON Journal At this point, we can only speculate. One theory could be that the pools are some type of sanitation device, much like a bath. However, there is no real evidence to support this. Betty Andreasson experienced a simi- lar episode during one of her abductions. The ETs placed her in a strange pool of liquid, although she was not made to breathe in the fluid. Betty feels that the purpose may have been to protect her from possible gravitational forces caused by the movement of the UFO. But the bizarre nature of most of the breathing pool accounts seems to indicate that something more is involved. Yet another possibility is that they are attempting to cure or affect the human body in some way. Arguing against this theory is that nobody has reported any physical aftereffects as a result of being immersed. Another theory that has been raised by abductees is that the reason could be psy- chological. Some procedures aboard UFOs involve the testing of human emo- tions. It could be that the aliens are at- tempting to research/affect the human fear response. Interestingly, human beings have also conducted experiments with breathable liquids. In 1965, Dr. Leland Clark of the Medical College of Alabama pioneered experiments keeping mice alive underwa- ter for up to 20 hours. Obviously, how- ever, this was not normal water. The liq- uids are actually known as perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Dr. Ron Holtz is a solid-state physicist who has noticed a strong relationship be- tween UFO breathing pools and PFCs. Writes Dr. Holtz, \"Perfluorocarbons are basically hydrocarbons with some of the hydrogen replaced by fluorine. They have the property that large amounts of oxy- gen and other gases can be dissolved in the liquid. Some PFCs can hold as much as 65% oxygen, three times the concen- tration of oxygen in air.\" Some limited experiments with PFCs have also been done with humans. In 1989, an infant girl was born at Saint Christopher's Hospital for Children in Philadelphia. She was expected to die, because she was born 28 weeks prema- ture and had badly damaged lungs. When doctors expected that her death was im- minent, the child was treated with perfluorocarbons. Incredibly, her condi- tion improved and she lived another 19 hours. Dr. Holtz also notes another important peculiarity associated with PFCs. As he writes, \"Another property of Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"perfluorocarbons that is of great techno- logical significance, but that is not as gen- erally known, is their property of low surface tension. That is, PFCs wet sur- faces readily, unlike water which tends to form droplets. \"This property is what allows the breathing liquids to fill the lungs com- pletely. This wetting property is also con- sistent with the 'breathing pool' experi- ences discussed by Jacobs. One experiencer reported that, after leaving the pool, the liquid formed a film on the body which had to be wiped off. Because of the breathability of the 'breathing pool' liquid, and its wetting property, it seems inescapable that this liquid is, in fact, a perfluorocarbon.\" Which brings us to a final theory to explain these accounts. Dr. Holtz says, \"The wetting property of PFCs makes them particularly suitable for an immer- sion media for high precision volume mea- surements. \"If a person is immersed in water with the intention of determining the volume of body tissue, there is an error in the mea- surement caused by the fact that the lungs are still full of air; the only way to elimi- nate this source of error would be to to- tally collapse the lungs, which would kill the subject, or to replace the air with breathable liquid. \"The 'breathing pool' experience...is entirely consistent with high precision body tissue volume measurement of the type just discussed. This explanation fits very well, and could be interpreted as sup- porting the reality of the experience.\" Whatever the real reason behind these accounts, one thing is clear: UFO occu- pants maintain a deep interest and exten- sive knowledge of the human body. Until we learn more about these rare types of encounters, the UFO immersion pools will remain another tantalizing mystery. Sources Carlsberg, Kim. Beyond My Wildest Dreams: DiaryofaUFOAbductee.

(Pete) Aldridge, chairman of the President's Commission on Imple- mentation of United States Space Explo- ration Policy, said a recent report calling for changes at NASA is \"not a vote of no confidence\" in NASA, but a blueprint for the changes the space agency must embrace if it is to take maximum advantage of the clearest presidential directive it has been given in decades. Aldridge said the commission was con- vinced that NASA headquarters and the agency's field centers throughout the coun- try must be streamlined and operated with modern business management practices. \"Changing the cultural nature of people will take a little longer time, but that's what we are proposing to do,\" Aldridge said. \"This is a tremendous thing for NASA. For years they didn't have a direction that's been clearly articulated by the President.\" The commission's 60-page report, \"A Journey to Inspire, Innovate, and Dis- cover,\" recommends a significant reduc- tion in the number of departments at NASA headquarters, and restructuring the agency's field centers in the mold of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA, which is run for NASA by the Cali- fornia Institute of Technology. The commission also recommended the creation of a White House office to over- see all of the government's involvement in space, including civil, military, and com- mercial space issues. The last time such an office existed was during the administration of the current president's father, George H.W. Bush. From 1989 to 1992 Vice-president Dan Quayle oversaw the White House National Space Council, a concept that had also been used during the Eisenhower administration when NASA was created. John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said the commission's pro- posal, if adopted by NASA and approved by Congress and the White House, would constitute \"the most radical transformation of how NASA does business since NASA was created.\" Logsdon said the most radical of the commission's recommendations was the proposal to transform NASA field centers into Federally Funded Research and De- MUFON UFO Journal velopment Centers (FFRDCs). He ac- knowledged that there would likely be re- sistance to that idea inside NASA and in the Congress. \"I think it is going to be a hard row to plow,\" said Logsdon, who was a member of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. Nevertheless, the report's recommenda- tions were not as radical as some steps that had been recommended during the commission's public hearings, such as closing some NASA facilities by using the same Base Realignment and Closure pro- cess that the Pentagon has used to close military bases. \"If we put into our report that NASA should undertake a base realignment and closure activity, the report would have been burned on the first day,\" Aldridge said. Aldridge said he does not expect the transition to FFRDCs to happen right away, and also acknowledged that it would take time, particularly to counter political resistance. Bush's space initiative: Return the space shuttle to flight, and fulfill the U.S. commitment to the Interna- tional Space Station. Halt most work on the space station by 2010, confining the American role there to studying health effects of spaceflight. Retire the space shuttle fleet around the same time. Increase use of robotic explorers. Start developing a new \"Crew Explo- ration Vehicle\" for venturing beyond Earth's orbit; test it by 2008 and launch its first mission by 2014. Use it to shuttle astronauts to the space station. Send unmanned probes to the moon by 2008, with humans landing between 2015 and 2020. Establish a long-term presence on the moon to serve as a launching area for hu- man missions to Mars and beyond. Bush would launch his plan by increas- ing NASA spending by a total of $1 bil- lion over five years, and by shifting $11 billion from existing space spending to- ward his priorities. NASA spending would still represent less than 1 percent of the total federal bud- get. Aldridge said NASA needs to trust the private sector to launch supplies to the space station.

He explains, \"It was sitting still, and as I went around a curve the object started to move slowly, then as it was going over my car it picked up speed and dis- appeared in a mat- ter of seconds. I then turned onto Brooks Road and as I came around the curve at the top of the hill a boomerang- shaped object was sitting in the sky directly over my car shining two white lights down on me. \"It had red, blue, and white lights all along the boomerang shape, some of them blinking and some not.

California object videotaped NORTH HIGHLANDS - Jeff Chal- lender reports, \"On the 12th of May 2004, my wife and her friend were out on the front lawn as my 17-year-old son got off the school bus. A helicopter flew over- head, and when they looked up an un- usual object was also seen that was much higher and farther away. \"My wife called me out, and it looked like silvery mylar helium balloons. I asked my wife to bring me our camcorder so that I might capture the event on tape. I turned on the camcorder, and aimed in the direction of the object. \"When I found it in the viewfinder, I zoomed in to 500x, the maximum this camcorder is capable of, and the object was bright and flashing on and off. \"It was moving east, while the wind was SSW, 10-15 mph. As the object pro- ceeded east, it became obvious that it would soon pass behind a tree in a neighbor's yard. The tree limbs offered a point of reference to gauge speed and di- rection with greater accuracy. \"The stationary tree showed that the object was not only tacking across the wind, but \"skipping\" side to side, and ap- parently up and down as well.

He stated that the objects he saw behaved like a \"sau- cer skipping on water.\" \"This object behaved in much the same manner, although it never presented any appearance of a saucer shape.

Slovak crop circles exhibit BRATISLAVA - The Slovak National Museum recently opened an exhibition entitled \"Crop Circles,\" displaying the pic- tograms and agro-symbols that unidenti- fied flying objects have left on Slovak ter- ritory. According to the exhibition's organiz- ers, witnesses have seen round, disc- shaped UFOs at the site of 85 percent of the crop circles here, as well as abroad. The exhibition displays all the pictograms from Slovakia that have been registered by the Trnava UFO club. Miroslav KarlA-k, the club's chairman, says, \"The Trnava club has registered nine locations where crop circles ap- peared, and 178 reports of UFO observa- tions in the Trnava region between 1992 and 2003.\" Captured on a videocassette and in pic- tures by amateurs, the display also features photographs from the Bratislava region. Another part of the exhibition presents the cases of pictograms found in England in the areas of Stonehenge, Crabwood, and Chilbolton. The exhibition runs until July 25.

The 1.3 kg (2.9 Ib) chunk of space debris dropped out of the sky and plummeted through the tiled roof of the Auckland home Saturday. \"I was in the kitchen doing breakfast, and there was this almighty explosion,\" owner Brenda Archer told the Sunday Star-Times newspaper. \"It was like a bomb had gone off. I couldn't see anything- there was just dust.\" Archer's one-year-old grandson had been playing nearby minutes before it hit. It is only the ninth meteorite found in New Zealand, and the first to hit a home. The Archers, who are following expert advice by drying the rock out in their oven, plan MUFON UFO Journal to sell it or give it to a museum. Experts believe the meteorite, a chunk of an as- teroid, could be worth more than NZ$10,000 ($6,290), the newspaper said. Reagan a UFO witness Ronald Reagan had a longtime interest in UFOs. He and Nancy were expected at a casual dinner party with friends in Hol- lywood when they were first married, and showed up a half hour later quite upset. They stated that they had seen a UFO coming down the coast. In 1974, as California governor, Reagan stated, \"I was in a plane last week when I looked out the window and saw this white light. It was zigzagging around. I went up to the pilot and said, 'Have you ever seen anything like that?' He was shocked, and he said, 'Nope.' And I said to him, 'Let's follow it!' We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our ut- ter amazement it went straight up into the heavens.\" Reagan, told reporter Norman C. Millar about the UFO he had seen, and that his wife and he had done personal research on UFOs and had uncovered references to UFOs in Egyptian hieroglyphics. When he became President he fre- quently discussed UFOs with his staff, received numerous reports on sightings, and made frequent references to UFOs in his speeches. It is interesting that his counterpart in the Soviet Union also had an interest in UFOs. In May, 1990, shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev made a direct statement about UFOs: \"The phenomenon of UFOs does ex- ist,\" he stated, \"and it must be treated se- riously.\" Massachusetts white flying disc CHICOPEE - My boyfriend and I were in the park, lying down on the bleachers on May 30, 2004, at 4 PM, just watching the clouds.

After it tilted, it disappeared. There was no air traf- fic for the next half hour.\" Thanks to Pe- ter Davenport. Massachusetts bright objects DENNIS PORT - On June 4, 2004, just after midnight, three brightly lit ob- jects with red, yellow and white lights July 2004"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"flew in perfect line formation over the witness' home. He was standing on his front porch talking to a friend on the phone when he noticed three light formations, each about 1/4\" in diameter (at arm's length), travel- ing faster than an airplane in a formation- one right after the other. The space between each object at arm's length was one and one/half inches, and they were traveling from SW to NE, one right behind the other. They appeared to be too close together to be commer- cial aircraft. Each of the objects was strobing lights of yellow, white, and red, which were very vivid. The objects stayed one right behind the other with perfect formation and exact dis- tance between the three. Eventually, they all banked due north towards Provincetown. Thanks to Peter Davenport. New York white circular saucer MOHAWK - The .witness reports, \"At about 7:30 PM I was observing a hawk flying, when I inadvertently caught a glimpse of a UFO steadily flying in a straight line on May 23, 2004, at 8 PM. \"It had no vapor trail or blinking lights like a normal plane. I watched it travel in a straight line for about a minute, then it flashed an extremely bright white light all around it, and it was gone.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. New Jersey oval-shaped objects GARFIELD - \"Looking up at the moon, the sky was clear on May 29, 2004, at 9 PM,\" says the witness, \"and from the northwest moving southeast was a single bright dime-size pure white light. It was moving very fast, with no sound and with- out flashing I.D. lights. I have never wit- nessed any type of light like this in the sky, even after many years of sky watching.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Florida objects put on show DUNEDIN - The witness noticed a contrail racing almost straight up at 8:20 PM on May 22 that looked like a shuttle launch climbing fast around sunset. It ap- peared in the middle of the sky and be- came visible very high, and kept climbing from there. \"As we marveled,\" says the witness, \"a second object appeared only as a light, and climbed side by side with the first. The second one had no trail and was faster overtaking the first one. \"Then, the first veered off, heading southeast, while the second one with no trail overtook and passed the first one. July 2004 Then they disappeared. The other witness said she thought the second one was sort of a triangle with slight wings. All I saw was a ball of light.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport. Florida pencil shapes FLAGLER COUNTY - On May 21 and 22, 2004, at 9 PM, pencil-shaped objects were seen hovering north of Palm Coast. There was a white light in the middle, and two smaller bright white lights on either side. The lights fluctuated between red and blue, and then just red, and then blue. The object disappeared after about one hour towards St. Augustine. Thanks to Peter Davenport. Illinois black triangle PEORIA - The witness was photo- graphing thunderheads around sunset on May 23, 2004, at 7:14'PM, with a Sony F 717. He took four images in less than a minute, and only the second image cap- tured what appears to be a fast-moving black triangle. This is a 5 mega pixel cam- era, so it can stand decent enlargement. It shows disturbed air around it. Thanks to Peter Davenport. UFO reproduces in Tennessee KNOXVILLE - At 11 PM on May 31, 2004, the couple was getting some lug- gage from their car and noticed a very bright object flying 40 degrees above the southern horizon. The witness states, \"We watched for several minutes, and I pointed out that there were no other lights (red or green) as normally seen with aircraft.\" His wife said, \"It looks like a sphere with a halo around it,\" and went into the house to get the binoculars. It flew west at a slow rate of speed. The moon was very bright, and suddenly a bright object emanated from the sphere and traveled at a very rapid rate to the east. The smaller sphere had a faint red glow to it and flew at a high rate of speed until it was no longer visible. The original object flew away, slowly gaining altitude. Thanks to Peter Davenport. Missouri black triangle KANSAS CITY - The observer saw a flying triangle with bright white lights on the vertices of the triangle, with a red glowing light in the center, while driving down Highway 152 towards Liberty on May 31,2004. He states, \"At 10:30 PM, I saw a group MUFON UFO Journal of lights in the sky only 300 to 400 feet high, and they were not moving-or it was moving towards me. When I got near I could see it was triangular in shape, black, with bright white lights and a glowing red light at the center. It hovered over the high- way away from a group of houses. I kept driving, though I really should have stopped.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Diamond shape in Missouri CLINTON - The witness went to bed around 10 PM, but woke up at 11:34 PM when he saw a blinking light outside his window about four miles away. It was blinking pretty fast, so he grabbed his bin- oculars, and it turned out to be a diamond- shaped craft. The witness says, \"I can't be too surz of this, but it had turned around in circles, and its lights were in the middle of this blinking light, and they were getting big- ger and bigger as the craft kept turning around. \"Realizing that I was seeing an actual UFO, I took images with my digital cam- era, but only one picture showed an or- ange craft with what seemed to be an- other blue craft behind it!\" Thanks To Peter Davenport. Arizona humming object GOLD CANYON - The witness re- ports, \"I was awakened at approximately midnight by a loud 'humming' noise on May 31, 2004, which I knew was not a helicopter, ordinary vehicle, or airplane. I saw distinctive bright yellow lights illu- minating my room. \"I felt I was coming out of a dream, but realized it was real. By the time I got out of bed to look out of my window, the lights and humming were gone. I have never experienced anything like this in my life, and have faith in God, so am not afraid.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Objects converge in California BENICIA - Three objects and another two seemed to meet in the sky, then two left in formation towards the east, and three made a new formation and left to- wards the west on June 1, 2004. The observer says, \"I flagged down the post- man and pointed them out at 2:50 PM, and the postman also saw the three ob- jects plainly. \"We saw two Mormon missionaries and I pointed the objects out to them. One saw the three objects, the other one did not. The white objects appeared to be round and reflected the sunlight.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport.

The secret of this seemingly ideal lifestyle and Michael's perpetually good humor is his knack for putting together travel guides that sell. These are not ordinary travel guides, however, but ones that spotlight travel by public transportation-the only such guides published in that special field. As of last Dec. 31, Michael has sold 178.031 of these helpful publications for travelers, for cit- ies ranging from London to Honolulu. He has also put together an occasional book. With both an MBA and a Ph.D. in Psy- chology from the University of Hawaii, Michael could easily settle into a more mundane existence, but his Ashland, OR, home seems to be little more than a base for exploration as he moves around the globe in search of more fodder for his in- formative books. It's not as though he has never stayed in one place, however. He spent two years in Europe making good use of his academic credentials by teaching at a branch of the University of Maryland. He has also found a way to work psy- chology into his travel activities, probing the innermost thoughts of more than 1,100 travelers for an upcoming book on the psy- chology of travel. Michael has also found time to set up photo safaris in Africa, but says he will not be doing any more until after he sells his ranch. That old Ph.D. in psychology also comes in handy in his work with MUFON as a consultant in social psychology. In this capacity he is forced to ponder deep topics, and come up with such con- clusions as, \"I think a logical thing to look at is the possible relationship between hu- mans and other entities. I think in the fu- ture there may be more acceptance of the idea that there are entities among us.\" Mike has been especially interested in this particular element of ufology since what he calls his most unusual \"UFO\" case, which occurred in Sacramento, CA, in 1971. \"This was an intriguing case involving a possible hybrid,\" he says, grinning mis- Page 16 chievously and obviously enjoying the un- usualness of the topic, \"although it was mostly circumstantial evidence. The re- search team sort of fell apart because a book was being written, and, worst of all, the possible hybrid just disappeared.\" Michael's UFO background also in- cludes work with the old APRO organiza- tion, as well as a stint as MUFON State Director for Hawaii. As Ambassador-at-Large for MUFON, he discusses UFO topics with individuals around the globe, attends meetings, and occasionally makes presentations, such as at San Marino. \"The ambassador role has opened a lot of doors for me all over the world,\" he ex- plains, but he says his favorite place for meeting other ufologists is right here in the U.S.-at Lou Parish's Ozark UFO Confer- ence in Eureka Springs, AR. \"It gives everyone a chance to interact with each other and with the speakers,\" he says. \"You see some of the same people every year, which is nice, but you also see new people as well. It's a small, isolated setting, and the informality of the Lone Star Bar [which is set up every year by confer- ence participants from you can guess where] is also a great place to compare notes and argue the issues.\" Besides aliens among us, what UFO topics interest him the most? \"Well, I'm intrigued by the Ramey memo and the at- tempts to decipher it-sort of serendipity and a chance role for science,\" he explains. \"I liked the idea of the Disclosure Project, MUFON UFO Journal but too many things have been lumped to- gether.\" Those who want to learn more about this engaging ambassador can check out his impressive, but \"let's not take ourselves too seriously,\" travel-UFO website at www.michaelbrein.com. Magnetism, science, and a floating hamster In 1842 the Rev. Samuel Earnshaw pub- lished his famous theorem which estab- lished mathematically that one magnet can- not be floated over another, and scientists operated on that principle for a century. However, Roy Harrigan apparently never realized that it couldn't be done, so he invented a spinning top hovering over a magnetic base and patented the device. Harrigan showed that precession-the rotation of a spinning object's axis of spin- creates an island of stability in a way that does not violate Earnshaw's theorem, but which scientists only recently discovered. As Theodore Gray points out in the Feb., 2004, Popular Science, there is a second exception to Earnshaw's theorem: diamag- netism, which is a repulsive magnetic force exhibited by all materials in varying de- grees in the presence of a magnetic field. For example, a magnet can be floated over a superconducting ceramic disc with virtually no concern for stability. Re- searches have successfully levitated chips of graphite, water droplets, and even a hamster named Tisha.

Dolan Not long ago, Apollo 14 astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell made an amazing statement concerning the possession of alien bodies by a secret group of \"insiders.\" In this short piece, I contrast that state- ment with the astonishingly cavalier treat- ment of this claim by the mainstream me- dia. The end result trivializes an impor- tant issue. A few months ago, Apollo 14 astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell made an extraordinary statement while speaking to a group of people. In attendance was Waveney Ann Moore, a journalist for the St. Petersburg Times of Florida (article attached below). At deep levels within the U.S. national security establishment, said Mitchell, sci- entists are in possession of alien bodies, and have been studying them in secrecy. Now, this kind of thing has been said before, of course. Anyone with the slight- est interest in the topic of UFOs has en- countered such a claim many times. And talk is cheap. Anyone can make such a claim. But with Dr. Mitchell, you have to look at things a little differently. Here is a man who walked on the Moon. Only 12 people have ever done that, and not all of them are alive today. He is also a Navy man, has a Ph.D., and possesses a lifetime of connections within the American national security ap- paratus-connections that very few people have had an opportunity to develop. His experiences make him unusually well- qualified to comment on this particular topic. So when Edgar Mitchell says that American national security personnel pos- sess alien bodies (and presumably alien technology), that's a very interesting thing. If I were in attendance at such a gathering, the first question out of my mouth would be, \"On what basis, sir, do you make such a statement?\" It's only reasonable to ask. And I have no doubt that Edgar Mitchell would gladly have offered an answer. But if Ms. Moore asked him anything at all, her article left no hint. Indeed, she quoted merely a single sentence of any rel- evance, and even that appears to have been significantly edited. July 2004 Dr. Edgar Mitchell On the other hand, she managed to work the word \"cabal\" into her article. And, oh yes, she wrote about Mitchell's religious upbringing (relevance?) and focused (to the extent possible in such a brief piece) on issues of \"consciousness\" and \"inter-con- nectedness.\" You can see where this is heading. Fringe City. Apparently, the only individual Ms. Moore found worthy of quoting was a self- described \"transformational healer\" (no doubt wearing a pyramid on her head) who blithely commented on how \"delightful\" it was that a man of Dr. Mitchell's stature was \"more open than ever\" to discussing the topic of life in the universe. The effect of the article was, without question, to trivialize both Dr. Mitchell and his statement. One suspects that in such ignorant jour- nalistic circles Edgar Mitchell appears like a rich, eccentric uncle who does whatever he wants because he's basically harmless, and, after all, you like him and don't want to hurt his feelings. On the other hand, there is a darker side to this. When someone of his stature is treated, again and again, in such a disre- spectful manner, then we can see that the mainstream media is never going to deal with the topic of UFOs and ETs in an even- handed way. MUFON UFO Journal For many years, Edgar Mitchell has taken his stand on the matter of UFOs, extraterrestrial intelligence, and govern- ment secrecy. He has at every opportunity taken the high road, the honorable road, at no small risk to his personal reputation. And he is telling us that he knows for a fact that secret insiders are studying alien bodies. That is a hell of a statement. Unfortunately, it is one that Ms. Moore was clearly not capable of dealing with. Could her inability be part of a grand con- spiracy? Or everyday ordinary incompe- tence? Or simply the result of some dumb editor who hacked out all the good parts? However you slice it, add it to the long list of articles posing as news regarding the topic of UFOs that only serves to keep this topic forever marginalized and emas- culated. The article in question follows: By Waveney Ann Moore St. Petersburg Times, FL, Feb. 18,2004 ST. PETERSBURG - Astronaut: We've had visitors. The sixth man to walk on the Moon shares his unconventional views. The aliens have landed. Thus declared Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell on Saturday to more than 200 admirers. \"A few insiders know the truth ... and are studying the bodies that have been dis- covered,\" said Mitchell, who was the sixth man to walk on the Moon. Mitchell, who landed on the Moon with Alan B. Shepard, said a \"cabal\" of insid- ers stopped briefing presidents about ex- traterrestrials after President Kennedy. For those who might consider his state- ments farfetched, Mitchell, who has a doc- torate in science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that 30 years ago it was accepted that man was alone in the universe. Few people believe that now, he said. Besides aliens, Mitchell talked about being freed of prostate cancer during a healing ceremony and his epiphany while returning from the Moon. \"I had an opportunity to be a tourist,\" he said, going on to speak about the sensa- tion he felt as he watched the Earth, Moon and Sun. Raised as a Southern Baptist, Mitchell Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"said his feeling of interconnectedness could not be explained by traditional religion alone. He later founded the Institute of Noetic Sciences. On its Web site, the California organi- zation says it conducts and sponsors \"lead- ing-edge research into the potentials and powers of consciousness\" and that it ex- plores \"phenomena that do not necessar- ily fit conventional scientific models, while maintaining a commitment to scientific rigor.\" The site also states that IONS, as it is known by members, is not a spiritual sect, political action group or single-cause in- stitute. Saturday afternoon, dozens of people made their way through rain to hear Mitchell and IONS president James O 'Dea speak at the Heritage Holiday Inn in downtown St. Petersburg. Lisa Raphael, a member of IONS who describes herself as a transformational holistic healer, said she was pleased to hear Mitchell's comments. \"Personally, what was most delightful to me was that he was more open than he has ever been, very direct about knowing that there are other forms of intelligent life in the universe and most probably that they have been here,\" said Ms. Raphael. David Caywood succumbs to cancer David E. Caywood, 41, co-author with Landi Mellas of the autobiographical book The Other Sky: Reclaiming Who We Are and Why We Came Here (2002), died June 7 at his Dearborn, MI, home. Caywood served for a time as editor of the Michigan MUFON Newsletter, and was in charge of the art gallery for the MUFON 2003 Symposium at Dearborn, MI, which included some of his own fine art in the exhibit. He also did the cover art and the Internet website for The Other Sky, as well as cover art for other books. Caywood was active in promoting Michigan MUFON and MUFON Interna- tional on radio and TV, as well as at Star Trek conventions. He was also active in meetings of the Michigan MUFON abductee support group. Caywood, an educator and computer applications consultant, referred to himself as an \"experiencer,\" rather than as an abductee. An optimist to the end, he explained that an abductee is subject to victimization, and the only thing possible was more victim- ization. What is possible for an experiencer?

Hello all: By now most of you have received the June issue of the MUFON Journal with the cover story on the alleged alien photo- graphed by Robbert van den Broeke on May 6. Without any further comments I know that I have seen this \"alien image\" some- where before. It most likely was in the pages of a UFO magazine, newsletter or book. Can anyone else out there remem- ber seeing this image before, and possibly even being able to cite a source? Any in- put on this would be most welcomed. Rick Hilberg Editor's response: While I don't recall seeing the image before, other than on the Internet (which was the same image from the same source), I would also be quite interested in know- ing if it previously appeared elsewhere. SciFi and Pocket Books combine on Roswell dig book The SCI FI Channel has signed a three- book deal with Pocket Books for projects spun off from their original documentary specials. The first title will be SCI FI De- classified: The Roswell Dig Diaries (Pocket Books; July 6, 2004; $14.95). This book will be based on The SCI FI Channel's highest-rated original special, \"The Roswell Crash: Startling New Evi- dence,\" which dealt with the first groundbreaking archaeological excavation of the Roswell crash site. The book will be released this summer. A spokesman said the book \"will reveal never-before-seen information about the 1947 crash at Roswell, and will contain the first public release of the final archaeo- logical report on the landmark dig.\" Archaeologists from the University of New Mexico, in partnership with The SCI FI Channel, set out to uncover conclusive physical evidence to help prove whether the claim of an extraterrestrial craft crash is science fiction or science fact. UNM's final report and the personal journals, written by project leader Dr. Bill Doleman, authors/investigators Thomas J. Carey and Donald R. Schmitt, and SCI FI VP of Programming Thomas Vitale, are compiled here for the first time.

The media made a huge song and dance, there were skywatch par- ties, and science centers the length and breadth of the country set up educational activities. The idea of all this was to in- form the public more about what they can see if they put their eyes on the skies more often than we tend to do. Did UFOs figure in these plans? What do you think? It was a perfect opportunity to help educate the public about the dos and donts of UFO observation. They could have been made aware of astronomical phenomena that regularly get mistaken for something strange-including bolides, space junk burn ups, satellites in orbit, bright planets such as Venus, and so on. None of this was adopted, because to scientists UFOs are the scientific equiva- lent of the bogeyman. A perfect lure Yet, think this through. Astronomers want the public to be more interested in what is up there. The public, by and large, is fascinated by UFOs. Surely this makes the subject a perfect lure to woo would-be generations of astronomers. After all, transits are, as the name sug- gests, transitory. You would have a hard time exciting the public with words like, \"Only 200 years until the next one,\" or \"wait for that great eclipse coming up in twenty years time.\" Why do not more astronomical asso- ciations or observatories join forces with the UFO community to help educate the public about unusual sky phenomena? It seems a wasted opportunity to me, since it benefits both sides. After all, there is not much argument over basic facts. UFOlogists know that many sightings are astronomical in origin. Making the public more aware of these things helps to filter out reports that have little long-term benefit to the subject. As- tronomers gain the attention of a captive audience via a topic that appeals to them This sounds like a win-win situation that if properly coordinated cannot do any harm. Yet the fear that it will promote hys- teria seems endemic in many quarters in the UK. A few years ago I helped set up a fundraiser for charity, part of which in- volved an exhibition at a science center. This was extremely carefully thought out, with no excessive claims about UFOs, fo- cus on IFOs that had scientific solutions, and pretty down-to-earth lectures in the planetarium. Very deliberately, nothing contentious was included. Despite this careful planning and the full support of the science center, what hap- pened? The whole thing nearly fell apart, costing children's charities thousands of dollars, because a few scientists at the lo- cal university organized a protest. They ac- cused the science center of pandering to mysticism and way-out fanatics. These skeptics were only talked around after what amounted to a \"prove you are not nutters\" grilling session with their self-appointed inquisition. Some UFO groups might have told these scientists to go boil their test tubes, but we had the kids to think of, and we stuck to our guns. The event went ahead, and was a massive success. Visitors swarmed around the meddlesome UFO display and entered the \"spot the IFO\" competitions we had set. So many wanted to attend the lec- tures that the number given by Peter Hough and myself that day had to be doubled. Lessons learned This all happened about 15 years ago, and you might wonder whether any lessons were learned. The answer is yes and no. The science center did become a little more liberal. In fact they routinely chan- nel through witnesses to me who think that they have seen a UFO, so that an investi- gator can follow this up. But they have first spoken with one of the staff at the space science center before being passed to me. Needless to say this is a useful liaison fostered by that charity event. But the other day, after receiving the latest call (soon after the Venus transit) I decided to look into the past 50 sightings received in this way. The latest one had taken me all often seconds to resolve, and I had a feeling that many of the previous calls had been equally obvious in their explanation. The truth was that not one of these 50 cases was worth much expenditure of ef- fort. I doubt that any can be said to have contributed to our knowledge of real UFOs. They were all classic examples of just how uneducated most people are about what is up there in the sky. Some of the sightings were of laser light displays, and others of aircraft turning into an airport. But over 60% of them had an astronomical explanation. They were Ve- nus, or Jupiter, or Mars, or something simi- lar, such as a bright star seen through fluc- tuating cloud. What was really worrying to me, though, was that these solutions were usu- ally so obvious that I found it hard to un- derstand why the staff at this science cen- ter (which has telescopes and is set up to help educate the public about astronomi- cal matters) seemed unable to tell most of these witnesses when they first called what they had seen without passing on the case to a UFOlogist. Which rather brings us back to square one. There is a clear case for better rela- tions between astronomers and UFOlogists over the subject of public interaction and education about what is up there in the sky. Everyone can benefit from the exper- tise and the often lengthy experience that UFOlogists have on these matters from a UFO perspective. What a shame that more of us are not given that kind of credit for what we can contribute, rather than looked upon with suspicion as if our primary aim is to sub- jugate the masses with tales of alien con- quest.

July 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PERCEPTIONS By Stanton T. Friedman Stan Friedman Far out Propulsion systems I recently gave an illustrated lecture \"Star Travel? YES!\" After the program an attendee asked me why I hadn't talked about string theory, zero-point energy, dark energy or any of the other exciting theoretical physics concepts being dis- cussed by the theoretical astrophysical community, especially since I was obvi- ously convinced that aliens have been vis- iting Earth and that they are therefore much more advanced than we are theoretically. I told him that I was not a theoretical physicist. I didn't have the math to do a de- tailed investiga- tion of these very far out no- tions, and was very wary of theory in the absence of solid experimental support for the theory, no matter how el- egant the theory, the math, and the phys- ics. He noted that I had stressed that tech- nological progress comes from doing things differently in an unpredictable way. Lasers are not just better light bulbs, al- though they do indeed emit light. I noted that the nuclear rocket engines that I showed pictures of were not just better chemical rockets. In both cases, entirely different physics were involved. I asked if he had been aware of the systems I had shown. He readily admit- ted that he was quite surprised and had not been aware of such large expenditures on such \"far-out\" programs. Indeed I had shown slides of two early models of aircraft nuclear propulsion sys- tems that had been operated (ground tested) by the General Electric Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Department based in Evendale, OH, when I worked there in the late 1950s. The tests were conducted at the Idaho nuclear test station. I also showed designs of the planned actual (rather than ground Page 20 test) much more advanced system that had been designed; an early model was tested before the program was cancelled in 1961. The planned power level was 300 megawatts.These were air-cooled reactors. The planes would have unlimited range. I also showed a slide of a nuclear ramjet sys- tem which was operated (on the ground) by Livermore National Lab working with Ling Temco-Vought before that program was cancelled in the mid 1960s. Power level was about 600 megawatts. I then showed a number of slides of the various fission nuclear rocket systems which had been successfully ground tested by Los Alamos National Labora- tory, Aerojet General, and the Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory. The NRX-A6 engine developed by Westinghouse was one that I had worked on. It was tested in 1968 at a power level of 1100 megawatts. The Phoebus 2B sys- tem designed by Los Alamos was some- what larger (still less than 7' in diameter) and had operated at an amazing 4400 megawatts before 1970. All of these used solid nuclear fuel cooled by liquid hydrogen which was pumped in very cold and came out very hot. No heavy oxidizer was used, so that the weight per unit power was quite low. These would all be used as upper stages on rockets able to go to Mars, NOT as launch vehicles start- ing at the Earth's surface. All of these were successfully tested out at the Nevada test site not far from Area 51 and west of Las Vegas, NV, near Jackass Flats. There have also been designs put forth of gaseous core reactors wherein the fuel would be a uranium-based gas and the temperatures of the fuel and, therefore, of the exhausted hydrogen propellant could be much higher than with a solid core. The Russians actually operated a low temperature gaseous core reactor. It is ironic that indeed some discus- sions are being held about the possibility of NASA reconsidering the possible use of nuclear propulsion for possible trips to Mars, 15 or 20 years hence. As might be expected, I was asked about why these systems weren't cur- rently in use. The reason is quite simple: there was no mission planned for any of MUFON UFO Journal them. Without a mission, budgets get cut. One must either fish or cut bait. These programs all desperately needed leader- ship of the sort provided by Adm. Hyman Rickover in the development of the very successful nuclear submarine program, despite the rants of the battleship boys. I also discussed fusion nuclear propul- sion systems of the type that I worked on at Aerojet General Nucleonics in Califor- nia in the early 1960s. We didn't test hard- ware, but were taking advantage of the then brand new \"hard\" superconducting materials combined with a reaction such as Deuterium-Helium-3. The enormous advantage of this reac- tion over the reactions being considered for Earth-based fusion systems is that 98.5% of the energy is produced in the form of charged particles, as opposed to neutrons. The charged particles can be ejected in a given direction with appropriate elec- trical and magnetic fields, rather than be- ing emitted in all directions as are the neu- trons which create quite a radiation shield- ing problem as well. The charged particles have roughly 10 million times as much energy per particle as they can get in a dumb old chemical rocket. We do know a lot about fusion, as the sun (and hydrogen bombs) are fu- sion factories. None of the programs mentioned above were black budget programs, but all the technical data was classified at the time the programs were ongoing. My ques- tioner admitted that he had not been aware of the existence or scope of the programs. The ANP program was spending $100,000,000 per year and employed 3500 people, of whom 1100 were engi- neers and scientists. I have rarely found any academics who were even aware of the existence of these programs, much less familiar with their accomplishments. Of course I stressed that I did not think that aliens were stuck at the level of fis- sion or fusion rockets, but were probably using techniques about which we know nothing. And that we ourselves have been progressing in technological activities at an incredible rate. Perhaps the best example of this is in the computer world. The atom bomb was designed by people using slide rules and July 2004"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"\"high speed\" desk calculators. There were huge systems involving a large number of energy consuming vacuum tubes. Then there were rather elementary transistors. The official birth date of the latter was December, 1947, less than six months af- ter the Roswell incident. Today's relatively inexpensive desktop computers use mi- cro-integrated circuitry that makes the early computers look like toys-expensive ones at that, but much cheaper, smaller, and far more powerful using much less energy than their early counterparts. Could anybody 60 years ago have pre- dicted such incredible advances and the omnipresence of microcircuits, micro- waves, lasers, etc, being used in a host of totally unexpected applications?. Considering that Zeta 1 and 2 Reticuli are just 39 light years away, but are at least a billion years older than the Sun, is it any wonder that I won't speculate as to the tech- niques being used for their deep space pro- pulsion systems? All the proposed new sys- tems are in my gray basket. I suspect that the odds are at least 1000 to one that we can guess how they work, and a billion to one that we could duplicate them with our still very primitive technology. Of course I also don't believe that aliens are using primitive radio, as assumed by SETI specialists, for interstellar corriT munication, but rather some technique about which we know nothing-just as we no longer use smoke signals for long dis- tance communication. Radio has only been around about 100 years, and they can't do better?? I seemed to have shocked some mem- bers of my audience, judging by the ques- tions, when I showed slides of the elec- tromagnetic submarine (no moving parts!) successfully tested by Dr. Stewart Way of the Westinghouse Research Lab back in thi mid-1960s at the University of Cali- fornia, Santa Barbara. I pointed out that, if one replaces the electrically conducting seawater that made that system feasible with ionized (electrically conducting) air, one can get around all the problems of high speed flight, including lift, drag, heating, sonic boom production, radar profile, etc. A technical report literature search that I had done while in industry way back in 1969 provided 900 references to work on magneto-aerodynamics. About 90% were classified. Equally shocking to some people was the data I showed on how much accel- eration people can stand when the force producing it is in the right direction (back to front, not foot to head), and the indi- vidual is properly constrained. A trained July 2004 Director's Message Continued from page 2) ough study of the evidence in thousands of UFO cases has eliminated all of these things as explanations for UFOs. What remains is a huge reservoir of Unconven- tional Flying Object reports that defy ex- planation. Unfortunately, the evidence has been ignored, misrepresented, or covered-up for so long that many people accept this as normal and no longer question it. We do have evidence of the quality that would stand up in a court of law, based on the criteria given in McCormick s Handbook of the Law of Evidence. What is needed now is the accumula- tion of all of the pieces of evidence that exist in the world today so it can be merged into one massive body of evidence. That body of evidence could be subjected to data mining techniques, and the results could become the basis for new techno- logical and scientific discoveries that are being missed while people argue about what the whole UFO mystery means and whether or not it is real. Position Announcements MUFON's interaction with the media pilot can perform a tracking task while being accelerated at 14G's for 2 minutes; that is 300 miles per hour per second. Some hot rod- zero to 36,000 mph in 2 minutes. People proclaiming impossibility really should do their homework about current technology, rather than worrying about the world of the future and theoretical phys- ics aspects which we are not able to come anywheres near putting into practice. One other area that seemed to provoke concern was when I stated that I was not claiming speeds greater than the speed of light, but rather taking advantage of Einstein's work on time slowing down for things moving close to the speed of light. It only takes 6 months, pilot time, to go 37 light years at 99.99% of the speed of light. For those who think that this crazy idea is just theory, I should point out that a number of experiments have been con- ducted-not with people, but with particles and atomic clocks-showing that Einstein was right. Some Tar out theories have in- deed been shown to be correct. fsphys@rogers.com http://stanfriedman.com MUFON UFO Journal is growing daily.

Marion Sheldon and Gus Jules were travelling out of town along the Alaska Highway on an ATV sometime after 1 AM last Sunday when they passed what re- sembled a person standing on the side of the highway. Thinking it was a local from their small community who might be in need of a ride, they turned around and headed back. As the two lifelong Teslin residents and members of the Teslin Tlingit Council ap- proached to within 20 feet, they noticed the figure was covered in hair, but stand- ing upright the entire time. Although the northern natural light was dusky at that time of the morning, Jules told Bakica he saw what he believed to be flesh tones hidden beneath a mat of hair. \"I have no doubt they saw something, and are convinced it was not a bear or any- thing in the ordinary,\" the conservation Astronomers find evidence for youngest planet Astronomers have found evidence for what could be the youngest planet ever detected, a world no more than a million years old circling a distant star. The finding was part of a trio of dis- coveries from the Spitzer Space Telescope announced at a NASA press conference recently. The orbiting observatory also spotted the raw materials for life-water and other prebiotic chemistry-in planetary construc- tion zones around five young Sun-like stars in the constellation Taurus, 420 light-years from Earth. \"We've seen the building blocks of hab- itable planets for the first time unambigu- ously\" in stars that will turn out like our sun, said Dan Watson, professor of phys- ics and astronomy at the University of Rochester in New York. The three discoveries are seen as re- lated, all pointing to the possibility that planet formation is common and that even Earth-like planets, which might support life, may not be rare. Page 22 officer said. \"They are convinced this was something out of the ordinary.... And they are pretty shook up over it.\" Sheldon and Jules were unavailable for comment. Bakica said Jules is an experienced hunter. He described the figure as stand- ing about seven feet tall, but hunched over. They could see it was not a person. The dark-haired figure departed, taking two or three steps to cross the Alaska High- way. Bakica, who has been checking out the story, said ground conditions, mixed with a few rainfalls, made it impossible to pick up any remnants of definitive tracks, and there was no hair on branches or the like to be found. As well, he said by the time he'd talked to Sheldon last and went to the scene Mon- day morning, half the town had been out to the site to have a look for themselves. \"I have no doubt in my mind that they believe what they saw was a Sasquatch,\" said Bakica. \"Whether it was or not, I do not know. Just because you can't prove something was there, does not mean it was not there.\" In April, 1991, three Pelly Crossing residents reported seeing a Sasquatch while driving between Pelly and Stewart Cross- ing. The creature fled back into the woods as the vehicle passed, but the three took pictures of what they claimed were foot- prints measuring 37.5 centimetres long in the melting snow. August Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -1.7), in Leo, can still be seen in the W at twilight, setting about 9 PM at midmonth. After that, the giant planet gradually sinks into the solar glare and disappears from view. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-4.3) reaches its farthest point W of the Sun on August 17. The resplen- dent planet rises in the NE shortly after 2 AM and dominates the dawn in the E. Saturn (0.2), in Gemini, rises in the NE about 3 AM in mid-August, joining Venus in the E during twilight. The lunar crescent is 5 degs. above the ringed world on the 13th. The Stars: As the Summer Triangle reaches its highest point in the sky, already we get a preview of the autumn months to come. The Great Square of Pegasus, Aquarius, and Capricornus all become visible in the E and SE at 10PM. Returning to the celestial summer sym- bol, the Summer Triangle is composed of the brightest stars of three separate con- stellations. Brilliant Vega lies almost at the sky's MUFON UFO Journal zenith in Lyra the Lyre or Harp. Look for a crooked rectangle, the strings of the harp. E of Vega is the star Deneb, the tail of Cygnus the Swan. Albireo, the head of the Swan, appears as a spectacular blue and gold double star in a small telescope. Finally, Altair forms the southern cor- ner of the triangle and marks the head of Aquila the Eagle. With some care, it is possible to detect 2 outstretched wings. The Eagle and the Swan fly on grazing paths in opposite directions along the Milky Way. Moon Phases: Last quarter—August 7 New moon—August 15 First quarter—August 23 Full moon—August 29 Meteor Shower Although extending from the latter half of July through the 3rd week of August, the annual Perseid meteor shower reaches a distinct peak on the morning of August 12. Toward dawn on that morning, up to 100 meteors per hour might be counted coming out of the NE. Members of this shower are very fast and bright, a third of them leaving persistent wakes called trains.

The comet, examined in a close flyby in January by NASA's Stardust spacecraft, has towering protrusions and steep-walled craters that seem to defy gravity. More than a dozen jets of material shoot out from its insides. Dust swirls around the comet in unexpectedly dense pockets. Among the bizarre features are two de- pressions with flat floors and nearly verti- cal walls that resemble giant footprints. They aren't structured like typical impact craters. The features have been named Left Foot and Right Foot in a new map of the comet, which is roughly 3 miles (5 kilo- meters) wide. Only two other comets have been seen up close, but both appeared fairly smooth and were nowhere near so heavily cratered. Nor do the pockmarked surfaces common to asteroids and moons bear much stylistic resemblance to the shapes seen on Wild 2. \"As far as we know, Wild 2 is a unique object,\" said Donald Brownlee, an as- tronomy professor at the University of Washington and Stardust's principal inves- tigator. Brownlee told SPACE.com that Wild 2 could represent a unique class of comet. It is more likely, Brownlee added, that Wild 2 will turn out to be a garden variety comet once more of them are studied up close. But learning whether Wild 2 is com- mon or unique will require visits to other comets, Brownlee said. Two flashy mis- sions are in the works: The European Rosetta craft, recently launched, will land on a comet in 2014. NASA's Deep Impact will slam a probe into comet Tempel 1 on Independence Day 2005. Scientists don't know exactly what com- ets are made of, but they're thought to rep- resent the composition of the outer solar system in its primordial state. They're loaded with frozen water and other ices, plus organic materials and sili- cates, or rock. Many theorists believe com- ets delivered the water and other pre-bi- otic ingredients that led to life on Earth. Comet Wild 2 probably gathered itself together 4.5 billion years ago, just after the Sun was born, in a region beyond Neptune known as the Kuiper Belt. In 1974 it had a close encoun- ter with Jupiter and was thrown into a new orbit that brings it closer to the Sun. A comet loses material when it approaches the Sun, as solar radiation causes ice from its surface to \"sublimate\" into space, car- rying dust and larger particles with it. The process creates a cloud of material that reflects sunlight and creates the familiar head of a comet (scientists call it a coma) CALENDAR July 16-18-MUFON International UFO Symposium, Marriott SE, Denver, CO: \"Unconventional Flying Objects-The Body of Technological Evidence,\" featur- ing Stephen Bassett, Grant Cameron, Pe- ter Davenport, John Greenewald, Budd Hopkins, Leslie Kean, Deborah Lindemann, Nick Redfern, John Schuessler, David Sereda, Ryan Wood, and Paul Davids.

Shoemaker Basin and sometimes a tail. NASA's Stardust probe flew to within 147 miles (237 kilometers) of Wild 2 on Jan. 2. The observations-and dust samples that will be returned to Earth in 2006 for lab study-should improve understanding of the solar system's formation. Craters on Wild 2, presumably caused by run-ins with smaller objects, are strangely free of the powder, rocks, and other debris commonly seen in impact cra- ters on other bodies. And because the comet is so small, the material does not fall back. \"There's al- most no gravity at the surface,\" Brownlee said. \"If you were standing on [the sur- face], you could jump into orbit.\" Yet Wild 2 is not a fractured pile of rubble that would all fly apart when hit, as some astronomers expected. Explains Brownlee, \"We're sure this is a rigid ma- terial because it can support cliffs and spires.\" Comets do blow up unexpectedly,\" Brownlee pointed out, adding that built- up internal pressure and \"steam explo- sions\" might be responsible for some of the surface features. 1U 111 H 55 z ui V) 111 Page 24 MUFON UFO Journal July 2004"}]
