FROM THE EDITOR Last month we had an overabundance of lengthy, thoughtful pieces on the phenomenon. This month, if anything, we have a surplus of UFO reports. Hopefully, as time goes along, we'll be able to strike a better balance between the two. In the meantime, Michael Rigg's lead article on finding \"hoaxholes\" in a \"UFO\" report should stand as a salutary example of how to conduct a field investigation, especially for beginners, who may have a tendency to take would- be \"witnesses\" at face value. We welcome and applaud Riggs' courage in com- ing forth in such a straightforward manner, and hope others heed this message well. As usual, space considerations have prevented us from including all the material available. We trust you'll be patient and bear with us as we continue to strive to bring you the best UFO journal available, monthly or otherwise. In this issue PINPOINTING HOAXHOLES  Michael J.

Rigg Rigg is a MUFON state section director, as well as founder and director of the N.W. Indiana Group for UFO Studies. This is the story and basic report of my first major UFO investigation, which involved, of all things, an obscure time frame, an entity sighting, landing traces, a possible abduction, possible animal effects, personality conflicts, and a twelve-year old primary witness. I won't tell tales: I really was expect- ing something tremendous on a scale equal to events chronicled in such notable resources as Incident at Ex- eter or Intruders. But, I suppose it's fortunate for me that I usually keep those things packed under a heavy lid of pessimism. By the time it came down to zero hour (interview-the- witness-and-investigate-the-site day), I was just concerned about all the work I would probably end up doing. Little did I know that I would find myself inventing new words to add to my ufological vocabulary. In the Oc- tober 1988 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal (Number 246), exactly one month before the case described herein, an article I wrote was printed entitled \"The Need for Skeptics.\" In it I presented labels for different types of UFO believers and non-believers, and I stated that the key to being a good UFO investigator may not be book learning, but a good skeptical mind that would examine everything objectively. \"Hoaxholes\" is a term I invented for investigators to apply to those little incongruities that arise in cases and create more problems and questions than they do answers or solutions. In my opinion, it takes a healthy skeptical mind to find hoax- holes, which may be so small they may never be found, and a case may slip out with an evaluation reading UNKNOWN when the truth is 180 degrees from that. Maybe it was because it was my first solo case that I was so cautious dur- ing the investigation, but as I pro- ceeded I began to get the idea of what MUTUAL UFO JOURNAL UFO investigations really mean, and I began to extrapolate a kind of code from between the lines of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, and other books, which aided me in finding the infamous hoaxholes. The fact is this: to think a case you receive is going to turn into a ufological \"best seller\" is downright foolish, no matter how huge it sounds when first reported. That fact became my personal credo. It's not pessimism anymore, it's called UFO investigation. The Story Twelve-year old Jeffrey Campbell (not his real name) awoke some time during the waning hours of November 5, 1988 to get a drink of water. The stillness of the house was broken by the creaking floorboards as Jeffrey made his way through the hallway to the kitchen. But when he rounded the corner leading into the dining area a bright flash of multi-colored lights caught his attention. Jeffrey turned on the dining room lights and moved closer to the dining room's large picture window to get a better look. The lights struck him fun- ny because normally there was no lighting behind the Campbell house, not even security or flood lighting. A large diamond-shaped object was resting quietly on the lawn, perched precariously on its lower point. It flashed lights in a random pattern around its edges, up and down its sides and around its outside edge, which was positioned low on the diamond giving the object an almost cone-shaped appearance. The strobing red, green and blue lights played around the object's copper or bronze colored exterior, casting un- dulating patterns of colored light around the yard, the trees behind the object, and the houses neighboring the Campbell's house. Jeffrey's mouth dropped open as he stood staring at the apparition. An escalator-like device slid down from the object's left rear ddge and Jeffrey craned his neck and squinted in an NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 attempt to see what was going to ex- it the object. Suddenly, but expectedly, a small being appeared at the top of the escalator/gang-plank, slightly hidden behind a jutting edge of the object. The \"alien,\" as Jeffrey called it, walked stiff-legged down the plank and disappeared behind the craft. A short time later the creature reap- peared on the other side of the craft and began heading toward the house's western edge. Jeffrey's heart pounded harder as he got a better look at the creature standing silhouetted against its bright craft. It stood about 5'3\" tall, its arms were proportionate to its body, but it seemed to have \"double feet,\" and claws for hands. The double feet resembled to Jeffrey the effect of bot- tomless boots having been pulled halfway up the creature's leg, the feet left protruding out from under them. No uniform or clothing of any kind could be seen, but Jeffrey distinctly recalls symbols or numerals across the creature's chest, a belt and buckle, a pronounced nose, a large squared mouth, and huge black or brown eyes. The creature's skin was com- posed of lizard-like green scales and its face was wrinkled and cracked with grotesque features. It moved in a relatively straight path, along the western fence of the Campbell's yard. As it approached, Jeffrey felt frozen and began to get scared as he tried to move his legs. At this point, the neighbor's dog began barking wildly at the intruder. The creature stopped and turned to face the dog, gazing at it coldly through the chain-link fence. Jeffrey gasped, thinking the creature might hurt the dog which continued bark- ing wildly. The creature reflexively snapped its head around to face Jef- frey eye-to-eye. The next thing the boy remem- bered was watching the craft slowly ascend and disappear over the house as it accelerated and rocketed off in- to the pre-dawn sky. No dogs were barking, and apparently no one PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"stirred, as the night returned to its previous stillness. Jeffrey found that he was now able to move his legs, went to the sink and filled a glass with water, drank half of it, then returned to bed. On his way back down the hall, Jef- frey bumped into his dad, who was just getting up and ready for work. Mumbled greetings were exchanged and Jeffrey returned to his bed and promptly drifted off to sleep. The next day, when Jeffrey came home from school, he noticed his mother standing in the backyard, talk- ing to a neighbor lady and pointing to the ground. He went out to the back to join his mother and overheard her telling the neighbor that she couldn't understand how the yard became marked with a strange diamond-shaped pattern of circles which, Jeffrey noticed, occupied the same area where the object he saw was sitting. His mother mentioned seeing similar marks in a photograph from a book she had read, called Intruders. She told the neighbor that a woman in the book had apparently been visited by alien creatures who descended in UFOs. Jeffrey couldn't believe his ears, and when the neighbor left, he told his mother what he had seen the night before. Jeffrey's mother im- mediately went into action: a friend of a friend knew someone in a group which studies UFOs, so a few phone calls were made and, before long, Francis L. Ridge of MUFON Indiana was contacted. Shortly thereafter, I was given a call by Mr. Ridge who proceeded to describe, briefly, some of the occur- rences which had been reported to him. I was given my first major case: A possible CE-3 or 4 with landing traces in Knox, Indiana, just two Counties across from my home in Griffith. Investigation Begins Ridge told me, knowing that I was a full-time student at a local universi- ty, that I could handle the case through the mail if I couldn't make the on-site investigation. That would be better than nothing was the im- PAGE 4 pression I got, but my conscience wouldn't let this opportunity slip by — I made time. The next day I called Sharon Campbell, Jeffrey's mother, (not her real name) and went over the infor- mation I had received from Ridge on the \"Initial Report MUFON Form M (CUFOS form FI-4).\" The form read, in part, \"Saw a craft & humanoid (green color). Four very visible spots in yard, still. Witness got up to get drink of water.\" AH of this was true, according to Mrs. Campbell, who proceeded to tell me the landing traces were still visi- ble and included burnt grass, crushed brush, broken patches of dirt and a new development. According to Mrs. Campbell, a new spot had \"grown\" overnight where the alleged landing plank had extended. The grass was discolored and patches of it were already dead, she told me. I asked her if she and her son would be free that coming Friday for an interview, and if she minded if the yard were examined, photographed, and probed for samples. She gave me a date and time, said anything I had to do to the yard would be fine, and thanked me for answer- ing her call to MUFON. I asked if she could cover the spots with a tarp to protect them from the weather and to keep people from treading on the af- fected area if at all possible. She said the affected area was quite large and her husband didn't have anything she could use to cover it. I told her it would be okay, since it would only be a couple of days before I would ar- rive to examine the site, but to do the best she could about keeping people off of it. I also went quickly over MUFON Form 1 on the phone with Mrs. Campbell, and she was very helpful in relating her son's story to me. This would come in handy, I thought, when it came time to interview the boy, as a cross-checking device. In the day or so that followed before I was to leave for Knox, I took some time out to re-read the MUFON F.I. Manual, talk to Mr. Ridge on the phone about how to handle \"what ifs,\" and find a trustworthy friend who had intentions to eventually join MUFON and could help me out with MUFON UFO JOURNAL measurements, hauling equipment and taking photographs. Hoaxhole 1: The Yard Since my contact, Mrs. Campbell, had related to me that the spots in her backyard resembled traces found in Intruders, I was expecting something really solid for Jeffrey's case. I spent hours preparing equipment: various sample containers, probing rods, trowels, forceps, and a special high- intensity chemical thermometer. Two cameras were loaded for both black and white and color photos of the spots, and extra film and batteries were kept in my field kit, which by that time looked more like a full set of lug- gage than a 'kit.' Since the physical traces were com- pared to those found in Intruders, I took time out to re-read the trace- related segments of the book and prepared \"hooking\" questions that would verify the differences between the book and this case. On the way to Knox I kept my eyes peeled, glancing around at the area for any UFO-attracting possibilities such as high-tension power lines, bodies of water, secluded areas, etc. all of which were present. In fact, the thought crossed my mind that this particular place (actually most of Northwest Indiana) is \"storybook perfect\" for Close Encounter cases. The Knox case was looking more and more like it could be the real thing, but I held off going to \"red alert\" un- til I actually saw the yard. The Campbell home occupies the middle of a one-sided block of homes in Knox. By one-sided I mean that there is nothing but farmland or forest across the street from the Campbell's and their neighbor's homes. And, speaking of the neighbor's homes, all the houses on the block sat with average spacing for a residential neighborhood despite the farm and forest lands. Behind each home was a spacious backyard and, beyond that, more forest and farmland. With the houses that close together I figured the probability should be high for extra witnesses, particularly with the dog barking so wildly. I arrived at approximately two o'clock that Friday afternoon and was NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 vl B ill"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"greeted by a slightly shy Sharon Campbell. I told her I wanted to take care of the yard investigation first, par- ticularly since I was racing against the sun and Jeffrey wouldn't be home from school for another hour or so. She lead the way to the backyard, around the side of the house, and stopped about a third of the way across the weathered lawn. I was admittedly dumbfounded at first and had to ask her to point the spots out for me. To my surprise, I was standing in one. A quick tour, that included a cou- ple \"points of interest\" Mrs. Campbell indicated (a golf ball and broken glass, \"apparently crushed into the ground by the weight of the UFO,\" in her words) followed and then my friend and I were left to go to work. My friend, incidentally, volunteered to of- fer his services, car and camera as he wanted to find out more about MUFON with hopes to join one day. If he couldn't be trusted to keep this case confidential until otherwise in- structed, I wouldn't have bothered to ask him. We began, first, by simply searching for items of interest: burned grass, broken twigs, rock, etc. and found just that. Everything in the \"picture-perfect physical case\" was there. Next, a string grid was laid out and measurements were taken. Then, photographs of every imaginable angle were taken in color and B&W, 35 mm and 110 in- stamatic film. Then, finally, control and site samples were taken in four sets each: grass, dirt, twigs and items. The \"items\" included the golf ball, some broken glass and some burnt pieces of paper. The spots were designated North, South, East, West and Strip (for the \"gang-plank\" area), and appeared as follows (clockwise from the rear of the house): The South Spot was a rough cir- cular patch of dead grass measuring an average of 8 feet in diameter. It contained a small pit caused by a burned and uprooted dead bush. The West Spot was a diagonal oblong measuring a massive 24 feet by 8 feet. It contained some small uprooted bushes, singed grass and burned twigs. The North Spot, measuring about 9 feet in diameter, was simply a MUFON UFO JOURNAL mound of discolored clover and crabgrass. The Strip measured 23.4 by 6.3 feet and was composed of unnaturally high grass, singed at the tips, plus the golf ball (pressed into the ground) and some shards of a broken bottle, label intact but not burnt. The East Spot measured about 10 feet in diameter and appeared as nothing more than a pile of broken and singed twigs. The entire area of the site affected by the alleged object measured 1,551 square feet! We finished with the yard just as the sun was beginning to dip in the west and Jeffrey had just arrived home from school. The case, so far, was no longer pro- mising. The witness interrogation would have to uncover some really tremendous facts. For all intents and purposes, the spots in the yard were caused by poor lawn grooming and nothing more. For instance: the East Spot turned out to be an obvious leaf-burning area, grass and twigs burnt all around; wind, carrying bum- ing debris, would congregate in the stretched out area known as the West Spot; and, small \"heel marks\" in the areas around the uprooted bushes seemed to indicate that the brush was uprooted on purpose, as if someone used the heel of his/her shoe to \"kick\" out the shrubs, undoubtedly to be burned. To add fuel to the fire (no pun in- tended), a neighbor was burning leaves while we were performing the investigation and the moderate winds were carrying singed blades of grass, leaves, paper and even small twigs through and over the Campbell's chain-link fence and into their yard. Further investigation proved that Knox doesn't have a ban on leaf- burning and neighbors had been do- ing it for \"several days.\" The only thing that could patch this Hoaxhole is if young Jeffrey could give me an accurate size description of the craft. By my calculations, con- sidering the size of the yard site and his description of its \"diamond shape\" the craft would have to range between 50 and 60 feet high and approximate- ly 40 feet at its greatest width. Plus, any \"landing gear\" would have to be NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 oddly shaped and fairly massive in order to set within the average 8 foot diameters of the four main spots. And, if the object was that big, chances are better than slim that it would have made some kind of depression. Even so, evidence still- pointed toward uncontrolled leaf burning as the culprit. Witness Interrogation: More Hoaxholes Jeffrey's mother dropped a bomb- shell on my investigation once it came down to interrogating the witness: she told me Jeffrey had some misgivings about being interviewed, and was afraid to talk about \"them\" for fear \"they might come back.\" But, after a friendly little 'get acquainted' chat be- tween Mrs. Campbell, myself, my partner and Jeffrey, the boy agreed to be interviewed if his mother could be nearby. Fine: better an interview with mother's watchful influence than none at all. This case had all the peripheral earmarks of having something big hidden within the plot. Isn't it possible to undergo an abduc- tion experience and have your mind play tricks to such an extent that you start embellishing the truth? Maybe the shoddy backyard was a coin- cidence to what actually happened. Besides, the prime — and so far on- ly — witness in this case is a 12-year old who loves comic books and television. My friend and partner on this case was instructed to watch behavioral ac- tions between family members, all of whom could at least be seen from our vantage point at the dining room table. Jeffrey, Sharon and at times Jeffrey's little sister were in the dining room with me; Jeffrey's father and older brother were in the living room watching television. Everyone was in earshot of everyone else. So, a perfect strategic and surveillance network had fallen into place. My friend jotted down notes regarding attitude and witness reac- tion, as well as making a few notes on the decorum of the house and the behavior of the \"uninterested\" parties in the other room. I first asked Jeffrey to tell me ex- actly what happened, which he did PAGE 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"shyly at first and then, as he warmed up to me, proceeded at an increas- ingly zealous pace. Mrs. Campbell sat nearby, silently watching. To make sure everything was accurate and not ma.de up or embellished, I had Jef- frey tell the story again, this time while \"acting\" everything out. He seemed to have an easier time imitating the \"alien\" than he had imitating himself which was an interesting note. During the interrogation, the following hoaxholes appeared: 1) Jeffrey outright made it clear to me that \"This may all have been a dream. I don't know.\" When I asked why he thought it could have been a dream he had no definitive answer. This could have been to cover his tracks, or a trance-like state could have been induced by the en- tity giving him this impression. Nothing is beyond the realm of possibility, but 'I had a dream' response makes for a good \"out\" if a hoax were the case. 2) Jeffrey's mother admitted that she has regrets that he might have made up the story (all this despite her intrigue regarding the UFO books she's read: Intruders, Communion). 3) Jeffrey's description of the craft matches, almost perfectly, the Cash- Landrum UFO (Jeffrey admitted see- ing an artist's rendering of the Cash- Landrum craft). 4) Jeffrey admitted watching \"UFO Cover Up ... Live!\" just a short while before his alleged sighting. In fact, all through the interrogation he was ask- ing me what I knew about \"alien bases in Nevada.\" I gave him blank answers, but it was interesting how 'coinciden- tally,' the Cash-Landrum UFO, and several artists' renderings and witness reactions during encounters also ap- peared on the show that matched things he'd told me. 5) Jeffrey admitted overhearing his mother talking about UFOs and land- ing sites with the neighbor woman before even thinking of \"checking the backyard for traces left by the object he saw.\" 6) Jeffrey's description of the \"alien\" as lizard-like is too reminiscent of sci- fi television (i.e. \"V\"), and not some- thing commonplace among the UFO abduction phenomenon. 7) Jeffrey admitted to having talked PAGE 6 about his experience with friends. He mentioned that \"The kid down the street said he saw a UFO.\" Jeffrey said he was a liar, and when I asked how he knew that, he answered, \"Ms story just didn't sound right\" (emphasis mine). 8) Jeffrey reported turning on the dining room light and watching the craft and entity with the light on all along. Having examined the area, it would be safe for me to say Jeffrey couldn't have reported the detail he did with the dining room light glaring on the window. Fortunately, the en- tire on-site investigation and witness interrogation lasted until after sun- down, so I was able to experiment to see how well one could see in the backyard with the dining room light on. I couldn't see anything but my own reflection. 9) One could argue that Jeffrey's description of the craft as \"immense- ly bright\" would countermand #8, but Jeffrey said, when asked to recount the story in greater detail, \"I really couldn't tell what color they [the en- tity and craft] were because it was so dark\" (emphasis mine). 10) Jeffrey could have been vying for attention as 'the middle child.' His older brother had just won a high school basketball game, his first time playing; and his younger sister was just showered with gifts on her birth- day, the day before the alleged sighting. His mother also admitted this as a possibility for \"the dream.\" 11) It was discovered that a loaded camera, belonging to Jeffrey's sister, was sitting nearby. When this was pointed out Jeffrey said, \"Oh yeah! I might have taken some pictures!\" (emphasis mine). Wouldn't he have remembered something as important as that from the start? And, finally: 12) Why didn't Jeffrey tell his father what he saw when they bumped into each other on his way back to bed? The case now looked like a Swiss cheese. My friend, who had remained silent during the interrogation, taking notes, gave me his report while en route back home. He told me Jeffrey kept looking toward his mother after giving an answer, as if to say 'did I say it right.' After all, Sharon Campbell was the big UFO enthusiast in the MUFON UFO JOURNAL family. The reader may recall that I stated for a craft to have made spots cover- ing a site area that large it would had to have been 50 to 60 feet high and at least 40 feet at its base. Well, Jef- frey was asked nearly a dozen dif- ferent ways to describe the height of the object: compared to the trees behind it, in feet and inches, com- pared to a telephone pole, etc. The best answer came out as: \"It was about as big as two or three cars stacked on top of each other [not bumper to bumper, stacked] and about as wide as a pick-up truck is long.\" So these tremendous spots were made by a lunar module-sized craft, approximately 8 to 12 feet high 1 and about 10 to 12 feet wide. Jeffrey also told me, \"It was exactly as big as that tree\" (emphasis his), pointing to a stubby pine at the northernmost tip of the yard. Before leaving I measured the tree as best I could. It was 10 feet high. Threat of Regression I reported to Fran Ridge my find- ings so far and he agreed that this case is more than likely a hoax, or \"dream\" as Jeffrey put it. The ques- tion now was, how do I know for ab- solute certain, and what about the next step: hypnosis? Ridge suggested I send a friendly letter announcing the next logical step in the case which, despite its truth or falsity, would be the only way — regression. Having received no answer in two weeks, I decided to give Mrs. Camp- bell a call. She thanked me for my time and effort, and for the letter, and said she had a response written but had forgotten to send it. She told me Jeffrey finally admitted the whole thing was a dream, and didn't want to go any further. She told me herself that she didn't want Jeffrey to go through regressive hypnosis. End of story. Ridge suggested I not send the site samples to MUFON as it would evidently be a waste of time to analyze, considering the state of the yard and the results of the interrogation. A follow-up report was written and sent to MUFON Indiana about four NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 Ji"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"weeks after the initial alleged sighting. It read, in part, that the area's first snow fell the day after the on-site in- vestigation, but didn't melt in 'peculiar shaped spots around the landing traces' as might be expected. Also, the Starke County Airport had nothing to report; no power problems occurred on the block; and none of the neighbors saw anything, or were even awakened by the 'wildy barking dog next door.' No other cases in Starke County resulted, or were ever found, that dealt with the same type craft or entity; and Jeffrey hasn't had any bad dreams, medical side-effects, or strange behavioral problems before or since the sighting. So, what it comes down to is this: if I had done the entire case over the phone and through the mail, going strictly by the witness' and his mother's descriptions, it may have turned out completely differently and no doubt dangerously inverse of what it actually was. Having gone through this experience, I am now the ultimate proponent of the importance of on- site investigations. You can't find the hoaxholes without 'em. By the way: I kept the golf ball as a souvenir.

The follow- ing article is adapted from his presentation before the annual con- ference of the International Fortean Organization (FORTfest '89), held in Northern Virginia Nov. 11,1989. If there are any F.B.I, agents here on official duty today, would you please stand up so we can begin com- piling a dossier on you? In the process, perhaps we'll learn that one of your grandmothers used to keep a scrapbook of clippings about the Loch Ness Monster; or, that one of your daughters is dating a UFO researcher. And you can be sure we'll share all this information with the American public. National Security ... or National Disgrace? Now, speaking of UFO researchers, I'm sure most of us here today are curious to know: Why is the Federal Bureau of Investigation spying on MUFON UFO JOURNAL such UFO researchers as William L. Moore and Stanton T. Friedman? Recently, Moore finally gained par- tial access to the 61 pages of documentation being kept on him by the Bureau. What he got was six highly censored pages (dated 1983) admitting the Bureau's interestin, and surveillance of, his research motives and activities. (The Bureau, inciden- tally, probably has the world's largest supply of black Magic Markers.) In his newsletter Focus (for Nov. 1, 1988), Moore reprints the six released pages, all bearing the marked-through securi- ty classification SECRET. Because of the F.B.I.-deleted passages, these pages are interesting more for what they don't say than for what they do say. So even the casual reader has no trouble reading between — literally between — the lines a message that cannot, and should not, be ignored: UFO's (or at least UFO research) re- main a matter of \"national security.\" If Moore considers it a status sym- bol to be featured in secret files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, then he shares this dubious F.B.I, limelight with such long-time researchers as NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 Leonard H. Stringfield, Stan Fried- man and Larry W. Bryant. In my own case, I had an en- counter with an F.B.I, agent back in the early Sixties. It came at the height of my letter-writing campaign aimed at local military and law-enforcement agencies in the area of my home town, Newport News, Va. F.B.I, special agent John Castles was sent from his office in Norfolk to my office at Fort Eustis. (Apparently, the F.B.I, feels more comfortable [or more powerful?] when it can choose to interview a federal employee at his official job location rather than at his home.) Castles proceeded to inter- view me as to my motives and methods in daring to write letters of inquiry to various officials about their role in UFO research. When, later, I asked F.B.I, director Hoover for a copy of Castles' interview report, I was told that, since such reports are kept confidential, I wasn't entitled to have a copy. That was in pre-Freedom-of- Information-Act days. Years later, through an FOIA request, I did ac- quire a copy. Bill Moore's research ser- vice has reproduced the entire Bryant PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"dossier for sale to the public. The Friedman File By far the most intriguing F.B.I, dossier up to now is the one being maintained on Stan Friedman. Not because it contains some hot poop on his research methods, contacts, and findings (so far as we know on Nov. 11) — but because no one can find out any detail as to its content or reason for being. The entire content — even the dates of its material, its number of pages, and its interagen- cy distribution — is being withheld from public view on the grounds of (you guessed it!) \"national security.\" Friedman had learned of his file in a round-about way. When, months and months ago, he made a pro for- ma request for any F.B.I, records on him, he was told that there are none. So he shrugged his shoulders and said, \"Well, maybe the Central In- telligence Agency has something.\" Sure enough, his FOIA request to the Agency did turn up one document. It was a request for a \"negative name check\" on him, back in 1985, by (you guessed it!) the Federal Bureau of Investigation. So he went back to the Bureau with the request that they reprocess his original request. And, this time around, they did find his dossier. They referred to it as a \"main file,\" saying that it's totally unreleasable. \"National security,\" you see. Or is it, in the long run, a matter of national insecurity? Only historians from, say, the 22nd century will be able to answer that question. In the meantime, Friedman ex- hausted the administrative-appeal process in trying to overturn the Bureau's denial of access to his dossier. This included a letter to the Justice Department of Aug. 17, 1989, in which he noted: \"It has been sug- gested that one reason for withholding both the contents and the size of my file is that various federal agencies may be engaged in illegal surveillance of me and of my family without benefit of court orders, ap- proval by designated authorities, or whatever.\" In its infinite public- relations wisdom, the Department chose to wait more than three months PAGE 8 to send a kiss-off reply to Friedman's letter, which has this poignant closing paragraph: \"[Justice Department records of- ficial] Mr. Huff, I am interested in doing right for my country and for my planet and for my family. Does there really have to be a court case to get to the bottom of this strange situa- tion?????\" \"Litigious\" Bryant With Friedman's encouragement, I offered to help contest the F.B.I, stonewalling. I, too, mounted an ad- ministrative appeal — to no avail. So, on Aug. 28, in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Alex- andria Division), I filed Civil Action No. 89-1271-A - Larry W. Bryant v. Department of Justice. As the Washington, DC.-area director for the public-interest group Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, I had been involved in a few other UFO-related lawsuits dur- ing the past 11 years; so I welcomed a chance to put some of that knowledge and experience to work on Friedman's behalf. Neither of us had enough funds to hire a lawyer, so I chose to handle the case pro se (i.e., without the services of an attorney). Shortly after filing the complaint, I filed a list of 10 interrogatories and a request for documents as part of the \"plaintiff's discovery process.\" The in- terrogatories centered on whatever UFO-related material might be con- tained in the dossier, while the request for documents sought a copy of any wiretap warrants that the Bureau might be using to listen-in ,on the home telephones of Friedman, Moore and Bryant. But the stone wall got stonier, higher and thicker. For the defendant moved for a \"protective order\" from the court -T- by which the government could avoid having to respond to any of my discovery requests. The stated reason: to answer them would be tan- tamount to revealing the entire con- tents of the dossier. In granting the motion for a protec- tive order, the judge did, however, allow me a modified form of discovery called the Vaughn affidavit, whereby the defendant was required to justify MUFON UFO JOURNAL with some specificity any cited FOIA exemptions-from-disclosure. Minor Revelation Filed on Nov. 13, the Justice Department's affidavit included a 30-some-page packet of documenta- tion purportedly from the Friedman dossier — all dated in 1985. Three pages were withheld in their entirety, while the others contained much of the customary blackouts — all made allegedly to cancel the sources and methods of intelligence-gathering, to protect the identity of confidential sources, to shield \"intelligence ac- tivities,\" and to preserve relations be- tween foreign governments. Along with the affidavit came the defendant's motion for summary judgment contending that the govern- ment had met its burden of justifying the withholding of the censored material. I of course opposed the motion, pointing out that the information grudgingly released via the affidavit reflected nothing more than what Friedman would have expected to be included in the dossier: e.g., the date and place of his birth, his schooling, his employment and marital history, even his passport data and security- clearance record. Where was the UFO-related content — especially as regards his association with William L. Moore? Nowhere, according to the af- fidavit, which was produced, mind you, by the same officials who originally had told Friedman there were no records being maintained on him by the Bureau. My opposition to the government's motion reiterated my plea for what's known as an in-camera inspection of the withheld material. This provision in the law allows the judge, at his discretion, to take a look for himself at the entire dossier. Had he so chosen to make that inspection, he would have been able to resolve my concern about the underlying motives for F.B.I, surveillance of UFO re- searchers — a concern expressed in these words of my opposition brief: \"If the F.B.I, 'intelligence activities' referred to in the Vaughn affidavit are being employed so as to counter, de- fuse, and disrupt/discredit this (and NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"future) 'UFO-coverup whistleblower' testimony, leaks, and leads, then this court has the obligation not to countenance such a perversion of the intelligence-gathering machinery of the U.S. government. Accordingly, to determine the extent of any misap- plied 'intelligence activities,' the court should perform an in -camera inspec- tion ...\" Unfortunately, the judge, on Dec. 1, chose not to \"second-guess the F.B.I.\" He declined to perform an in- camera inspection. And he granted the government's motion for sum- mary judgment. Case closed. Court of Public Opinion If any of you in the audience today are F.B.I, agents on official duty, here's what you can report back to your headquarters: • Tell your boss that I'm asking all Forteans and UFO researchers to sub- mit FOIA requests for access to their F.B.I, dossiers; then you'll all be prepared for the lengthy processing task ahead of you in the Court of Public Opinion. • Tell your boss to be ready for a number of congressional inquiries about the Bureau's role in spying upon UFO researchers — since I'm asking that all concerned citizens write their elected representative with the request that Congress look into the matter. Don't be surprised if the con- gressperson sends your boss a copy of this article as background material. • And, finally tell your boss that this policy of spying on UFO researchers makes as much sense as the Bureau's practice of compiling dossiers on famous writers of the Forties and Fif- ties: UFO researchers are no more a threat to the Bureau — or to the na- tion — than were Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis, John Steinbeck, Pearl Buck or William Faulkner. Stan Fried- man shares a special bond with those literary giants — in that, even though he has yet to be accused of any criminal activitiy or disloyal conduct, he remains high on the list of F.B.I, surveillance. What does this tell us about the status of free speech and free inquiry in America today? FOIA Footnote Now that this legal milestone in UFOlogy has been concluded, some of my associates have asked, \"What's next, Larry?\" Well, based on certain information being censored from UFO researcher Richard H. Hall's C.I.A. dossier, I've requested full access to that portion of the dossier pertaining to me. If the Central Intelligence Agency insists on denying me full access, I plan to take the necessary legal ac- tion. When I do so, it will have added a certain finality to this censored Aug. 14, 1973, passage from the Hall dossier: \"[deleted] is not going to pur- sue the matter; however, [deleted] in their telephone conversation, sug- gested that we had not heard the last from Mr. Bryant.\" New Brunswick Close Encounter By Walter N. Webb Webb, a MUFON consultant in astronomy, contributes the Jour- nal's monthly Night Sky column. Note: Since the primary witness/informant and her mother have requested anonymity, I have assigned fictitious first and last names to all the witnesses along with their neighbors in order to prevent any chance at identification. The street along which the sighting occurred is not identified. Background In July 1989 I spent a week on New Brunswick's Grand Manan Island, which is located in the Bay of Fundy between Maine and Nova Scotia. Measuring 15 by 7 miles, the scenic island has one main highway (Route 776) on its eastern side link- ing half .a dozen picturesque fishing MUFON UFO JOURNAL villages. The interior and western side of the island are covered with spruce forest and upland heath and are largely uninhabited. With the excep- tion of Dark Harbour, the entire west coast is an inaccessible cliff wall tower- ing some 300 feet high. On July 6 Mrs. Terence (Roberta) Wheeler of North Head led my com- panion and me on a walk along the North Head Fisherman's Wharf. As it happened, we were the only par- ticipants that morning. In referring to some of the legends and mysteries of Grand Manan, Roberta alluded briefly to balls of light rising from the ground somewhere on the island. She volunteered that she herself had sighted something even more mysterious. Other Grand Mananers also had reported sightings which they didn't like to talk about. Of course, I immediately expressed my interest in her experience. NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 Although somewhat reluctant and embarrassed, she summarized what appeared to be a UFO close en- counter when she was nine and liv- ing in Seal Cove, the island's southernmost village. A total of eight or nine family members and neighbors also witnessed the object. After carefully determining that I wasn't \"a reporter for the National En- quirer,\" Roberta agreed to meet me for a more lengthy interview at a later time. She said she would try to en- courage one or more of the others to talk with me about the sighting, although she couldn't guarantee that anyone else would be willing. She ex- plained that islanders can be quite provincial and have a great fear of be- ing ostracized by their neighbors for claiming to see such things as UFOs. (Sounds familiar!) At my request she agreed to show me where her en- counter took place. Roberta Wheeler PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"is the wife of a fisherman, the mother of five children and age 32. Three days later on the 9th Rober- ta drove to my inn in North Head where we began the interview. Because of her time constraints, I had only about an hour to meet with her and drive the 12 miles to her parents' home in Seal Cove, where the ex- perience occurred. Her parents and family were away at church services. The principal observer told me she spoke with a number of the other witnesses, but all were unwilling to be interviewed. Roberta and her mother (one of the observers) remained con- cerned that I might be connected with an American tabloid and asked to see my credentials. They didn't want the family's name in a newspaper. I reassured Roberta that I would not use real names in my report. In- terestingly, her mother-in-law advised her to go ahead with the interview since the experience had haunted the young woman all these years. But even Roberta's mother, Bonnie Fen- wick, hinted to her that she might be willing to write down her own recollection of the sighting for me later if I proved to be a legitimate researcher. Unfortunately, I was unprepared for a UFO investigation on my vaca- tion and therefore didn't have my field equipment or tape recorder. I was able to photograph and sketch the site, however. Soon after I returned home, I wrote Roberta's mother, enclosing a MUFON sighting form and a bio of myself. I pointed out that while her daughter's observation details certainly were important, Roberta was a child of nine when the UFO sighting took place and thus an adult's recollection of the event would prove extremely valuable. After failing to hear from Mrs. Fen- wick for more than 1 and Va months, I telephoned Roberta August 31. She reported that her mother received my letter, did intend to cooperate, and would be reminded \"to get on it.\" Despite those assurances, as of November 1, I heard nothing from Mrs. Fenwick and therefore decided to proceed with this report minus the supporting testimony. The Encounter PAGE 10 Seal Cove is a picturesque little village, the center of which is nestled in a hollow around a sheltered tidal creek (Seal Cove Brook) lined with wharves and sheds. The outer harbor is protected by a seawall. Many of the island's lobster and scallop fishermen make the village their home port, and a sardine cannery and smoked her- ring are major industries there. Roberta's parents still live on the street where the 1966 UFO encounter happened. The witness thought she was nine years old at the time, plac- ing the experience in the year 1966, and she felt that the month was definitely August. One evening she recalled sitting in the backyard \"pouting\" about something. The sky was clear and star-filled, and it was completely dark outside. She had been outdoors for perhaps a half hour (uncertain) when she spotted high up (elevation perhaps 60°) in the (southwest) sky a stationary, pulsing, white light. The time: about 9:30 or 10 (Atlantic Daylight Time?). After watching the starlike light for perhaps 10 to 15 minutes (uncertain), Roberta reported that the object sud- denly dropped from the sky, ap- proaching her rapidly and within seconds stopping just above a row of spruces behind their artificial rec- tangular pond about 300 feet away. (The trees are now gone, and the pond has been drained.) The woman described the now large object as a \"neon pink line,\" bright but not blinding and without any detail or discrete lights on it. When asked to draw the UFO, Rober- ta sketched a long thin oval with pointed ends. Still alone in the backyard, the witness thought the craft might kid- nap her. But she remembered what her mother had told her about getting into cars with strangers. \"I had a choice,\" Roberta explained to me. \"Either I could go aboard that thing or go tell my mother.\" Quickly the child rushed into the house through the back door. Her mother, Bonnie Fenwick, was on the telephone with Jennifer McCulloch, a friend around the comer on Church Street (Route 776). Roberta excited- ly told Mrs. Fenwick about the \"fly- MUFON UFO JOURNAL ing saucer,\" whereupon her mother instructed Mrs. McCulloch to go out and see the object. The neighbor's house was west of the pond and in a good position for someone to observe the UFO. Six members of the Fenwick fami- ly headed for the back door — Rober- ta, Mrs. Fenwick, Grandmother Fen- wick, Roberta's sisters Cynthia, age 10, and Shirley, about 5, and her brother Thomas, 8. Mrs. McCulloch, her son Allen, and a toddler Marjorie also went outside and observed the object. That meant a total of eight or nine witnesses. Roberta ran outdoors first and was surprised to find that the UFO had moved to a point behind the Robin- sons' house to the left (southeast) of the pond. The object appeared closer and lower and was tilted to reveal a wider oval shape. In fact, the UFO hovered so close to the neighbor's house that, according to Roberta, it turned the gray shingles on the side of that house pink. She remembered thinking the house was going to catch fire from the glowing light. When Roberta pointed out the Robinson house to me, I could see that it was three houses down the street from her parents' place and set farther back than the other houses toward a meadow that ran from the pond southeastward all the way to the coastline. She said the object hovered at or below the roofline of the Robin- son house. (A garage now stands below where the UFO hovered.) I judged that the object would have been about 10 to 20 feet above the ground, possibly around 200 feet from Roberta, and perhaps 25 to 30 feet in diameter. (The witness guessed that the object was as long as the roof of the house.) As the rest of Roberta's family dashed into the yard, the disc-shaped object backed up above the meadow and started moving horizontally southeastward roughly parallel to the street. Roberta ran down her driveway and then turned down the street to follow the UFO. She saw it pass behind other houses, including the Sawyers'. As she reached the end of the street, the young witness watched the object advance toward the shoreline of the island, tilt up at an NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"angle as it turned right (southward), and then go down behind trees at the shore. Although Roberta thought the UFO had dropped into the water, she never saw it actually enter the water. It is just as likely that the object con- tinued southward along the coast. The point of disappearance is not far south of the Seal Cove Fisherman's Wharf. When the youngster ran back to her yard, she was aware that the rest of her family had observed the UFO. But her grandmother and her mother — mindful of the strangeness of their sighting and the possibility of ridicule if they reported it — told the young girl that \"she never saw it\" and should never tell anyone about what she witnessed. As an example of what can hap- pen to someone on the island who reports a UFO, Roberta told me a woman named Rosalie Harvey \"men- tioned her sighting to townspeople and was ostracized for it.\" Roberta recalled that a couple of nights after her encounter there were reports of six or seven sightings in an area from south of Seal Cove north to Grand Harbour. She was unaware of specific details. The witnesses claimed that there were many sightings, or rumors of sightings, of strange phenomena on the island. She mentioned a ball of fire entering a house in Castalia dur- ing a thunderstorm. (I explained it as ball lightning.) A swampy area known as \"Dog Hollow\" emits balls of light. (My answer was swamp fire or will- o'-the-wisp.) Another time a fisher- man near Cheney Island was rumored to have had some sort of ex- perience that \"turned his hair white overnight,\" according to my informant. Roberta Wheeler trusted me enough to describe some psychic or paranormal phenomena which she has experienced prior to and after her UFO experience. Before the sighting, she said she had the ability to see human auras in different colors. Following the UFO encounter, she was told not to speak of the sighting or about her perception of the aura. Roberta said she has been unable to see the aura ever since. However, beginning in her teen years, she said she started having out-of-body ex- periences which continue to the pre- sent day. Evaluation It is impossible to evaluate this 1966 report fully for a number of reasons — the limited time to properly in- vestigate at the site, the unavailabili- ty of the other witnesses, the absence of my field equipment (I was vacation- ing) , and the age of the encounter (23 years). Of the eight or nine probable witnesses, I was able to interview on- ly Roberta. On the plus side, however, she would have had the longest and closest view of the UFO; on the debit side, she was nine years old when the sighting occurred. It would have been extremely helpful if I had had an adult's recollection of the experience. But Roberta's mother failed to re- spond to my request for her account of the event. Nevertheless, I was greatly im- pressed by Roberta, who certainly was unaware of my own UFO involve- ment when she first innocently al- luded to her experience. Though at first understandably reluctant to trust a stranger with her story, she seem- ed genuinely interested in unburden- ing herself about this event which had had an obvious emotional impact throughout her life. The appearance of the object as a large glowing oval and its behavior (sudden rapid ap- proach and hovering/moving silent- ly at very low levels in proximity to dwellings) clearly place the sighting in the UFO category. Taking into account the limited nature of the investigation and other factors (no supporting testimony, age of the primary witness at the time of the sighting, age of the sighting itself), I believe the 1966 episode should be classified as a tentative unknown. I also give it a Paranet/Hynek Strangeness/Probability Rating of S5/P3 (Highly strange suggesting in- telligent guidance/Somewhat credi- ble or indeterminate). The Greenville Sightings This follow-up is to report an un- fortunate set of events that have led to a possible significant case. The case is that of Gina Jones and her husband from Greenville, South Carolina. The story was first aired on November 17, 1989 by \"Current Affair\" and involved video taping five orange lights in the night sky on October 31st. During the video taping, part of the Jones' house was visible and something moved past the bathroom window. The Joneses did not even discover this until they MUFON UFO JOURNAL By Forest Crawford Illinois Asst. State Director viewed the video tape later. The \"Current Affair\" program also men- tioned MUFON as being the largest UFO organization in the world, and said we were sending a representative to review the tape. Upon hearing this, I decided to call the State Director of South Carolina, Richard Coffman, to get the scoop on the case. At this point, I realized something was wrong. I gave Richard all the information from the TV show, and we agreed to NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 stay in touch. About a week later, I was talking to Bob Oechsler and asked if he knew if the tape had been sent to Dr. Bruce Maccabee or himself. He said that he had seen the segment, but knew of no tape being sent. At this point, it became a per- sonal obsession to find out what was happening. I called Richard back, and he still had not found out anything, so we agreed to keep trying. I then called the radio station WFBC in Greenville. PAGE 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"While awaiting a call back from them, I called \"Current Affair\" Producer, Merle Pollak. Ms. Pollak was very professional and cooperative, and was very glad to help in any way. She informed me that she had spoken to Gina the day before. Gina was wondering why she had not heard from MUFON yet. I told her that was why I was calling, and she explained that they had heard about the story through the radio station and put together the seg- ment. She called Walt Andrus to in- form him of the case and segment to be aired, but Walt was out of town. Before Walt could.get back to them, they aired the show. This finally ex- plained why the show was aired before we really knew about it. Ms. Pollak gave me Gina's phone number and asked me to keep her in- formed, because they may do a follow-up after MUFON's examination of the video tape. I promptly called Gina and apologized for the delay. I talked with Gina and her husband several times over the next few days and found them both to be intelligent, articulate people. A combination of caution and objectivity reflected gen- uineness in their wanting to under- stand what they had experienced. I believe these characteristics were reflected on the \"Current Affair\" seg- ment. She did not jump to conclu- sions and came across as sincere and believable. Any MUFON field in- vestigator would have been proud of her attitude. I also feel that the \"Cur- rent Affair\" staff, and especially Merle Pollak, should be congratulated for presenting this case in an objective fashion, with some theatrics and very little laugh factor. Showing the airport tower while mentioning MUFON's world acclaim was a very nice touch. No one should be embarrassed by the breakdown of communication. An unfortunate set of circumstances will occasionally cause this to happen. Nor should I be patted on the back, because I was only doing what I feel is part of my responsibility. Every MUFON member, and es- pecially MUFON officers, should ac- cept the personal responsibility to keep the lines of communication open. This is what makes us great and can make us greater. If we hope to PAGE 12 continue growing as a significant con- tributor to the UFO enigma, com- munication is vital. By the same token, no one should be ashamed to call someone to ask for help or advice in any situation. We are a team of professional UFO researchers - not single egos elbow- ing each other for position. Just as it took teams of profes- sionals from secretaries to aeronautical engineers to put together the Space Shuttle and launch it into flight, so will it take our combined ef- forts to understand this most signifi- cant phenomena. But I am only reflecting the feelings of other well respected urologists like Marge Christensen, Leonard Stringfield and John Schuessler, to name a few. Remember, if you're curious or un- sure - just call. Note by Walt Andrus, Associate Editor. This case was assigned to Margaret Pine, State Section Director, who lives about 15 miles south of Greenville, SC with a copy to Richard Coffman, State Director, in Columbia: Both have been in telephone contact with Gina Jones, but due to the work schedules of Gina Jones and Margaret Pine, they have had difficul- ty fulfilling appointments to meet. In a telephone interview by Walt An- drus, Gina is very anxious to cooperate with MUFON, but was disappointed with the delays. She has agreed to allow MUFON to make a copy of her VHS tape depicting the event. Mrs. Pine will follow through on this assignment. Kirkus Reviews Gulf Breezy Walters, Ed & Frances Walters THE GULF BREEZE SIGHTINGS: The Most Astounding Multiple Sightings of UFOs in U.S. History Morrow $21.95, Publication date March 19; SEN: 688-09087-7 The muffin-shaped craft, portholes dotting its circumference and white light bursting from its bottom, hovers over a night country road — a UFO? Maybe: in any case, that's one tantaliz- ing Polaroid image of many (five seen by Kirkus) that boost this unassuming, quietly persuasive account of alleged recent multiple visitations of UFOs — and their occupants — to the small town of Gulf Breeze, Florida. Despite a bombastic preface by top UFOlogist Budd Hopkins (Intruders, 1987), what gives this outlandish tale the ring of truth is Ed Walters' solid background and modest voice. A pro- minent Florida builder-developer, he — or so his story goes — had no in- terest in UFOs before November 11, 1987, when a UFO buzzed his house, levitated him with a blue beam, and sped away — but not before Ed took some Polaroid shots, which he sent anonymously to the local paper. Over the next six months, further sightings MUFON UFO JOURNAL apparently followed — not only by Ed and his wife, Frances, whose account augments Ed's here, but by over 100 other local residents as well — as did further Polaroids, and a videotape. Maintaining anonymity for months, Ed went on feeding information to the press and called in UFO experts, in- cluding the private investigatory body MUFON and, eventually, Hopkins. Meanwhile, the visitations continued, culminating by April 1988 in an alleged probable abduction of Ed, several ter- rifying encounters with aliens, and hints of a past series of abductions carried on throughout Ed's life. Lacking the mystical melodrama of Whitely Strieber's UFO books, and the controlled hysteria of Hopkins' and others, this account weighs in as the most levelheaded and believable of first-person UFO tales. That, plus the startling photos — explored in detail here by an optical physicist —. add up to a book that will likely in- trigue many. Jim Kobak's — Kirkus Reviews 1/15/90 200 Park Avenue South, New York, NY 10003 NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Soviet Media UFO Sightings The following report originally appeared under the auspices of a \"Foreign Press Note\" compiled by John Haley of the Foreign Broad- cast Information Service, Produc- tion Group. Our collective thanks to Larry Bryant, Bruce Maccabee and Robert Bletchman for making it available to Journal readers. Leading Soviet newspapers and journals have recently begun publishing an increasing number of articles and new reports on sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) in various areas of the Soviet Union. A \"permanent center\" for the study of UFOs has been established in Moscow to conduct research and sup- port the investigation of reported sightings. Setting the tone for this media coverage was an article in the July 9, 1989 Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya, which referred to many recent reports of UFO sightings in the USSR. Inter- viewed by the paper, P. Prokopenko, director of a laboratory for the study of \"anomalous phenomena,\" stated that a \"permanent center\" for the study of UFOs is being established in the Soviet Union. In addition to con- ducting research and presenting lec- tures on UFOs, the center will support the investigation of reported sightings. In referring to an issue of the paper published in July 1988 that included a report on \"an amazing event that took place on Hill 611 near the village of Dalnegorsk in Primorskiy Kray,\" the article noted that the event is still under investigation. Many observers saw a flying sphere crash into one of the hill's twin peaks, and physicists and other scientists from the Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences are still studying the \"fine mesh,\" \"small spherical objects,\" and \"pieces of glass\" that are considered to be small remnants left behind by the sphere. According to the article, the alleged spacecraft was nearly obliterated in the crash, but there ap- pears to be enough material at the site for the scientists — a mixture of UFO MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"enthusiasts\" and skeptics — to even- tually \"penetrate this mystery.\" In studying the site, scientist A. Makeyev reported finding gold, silver, nickel, alpha-titanium, molybdenum, and compounds of beryllium. One of the \"skeptical\" physicists from Tomsk has hypothesized that the so-called sphere could have been some kind of a \"plasmoid,\" formed by the \"interac- tion of geophysical force fields,\" which captured the elements found by Makeyev from the atmosphere on its trajectory toward disintegration on the hilltop. Other researchers have generally rejected this explanation since the amounts of various types of metals found at the site would imply, according to this \"plasmoid\" theory, that \"the concentration of metals in the atmosphere should exceed the present level by a factor of 4,000.\" Some of the scientists have con- cluded that the object that crashed in- to Hill 611 was an \"extraterrestrial\" space vehicle constructed by highly intelligent beings. Doctor of Chemical Sciences V. Vysotskiy stated that \"without doubt, this is evidence of a high technology, and it is not anything of a natural or terrestrial origin.\" He cited the fact that the remnants of fine mesh included bits of thin threads with a diameter of only 17 microns and that these threads, in turn, were com- posed of even thinner strands twisted into braids. Extremely thin gold wires were discovered intertwined in the finest threads — evidence of an in- tricate technology beyond the present capabilities of terrestrial science, ac- cording to Vysotskiy. More Reports Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya of Ju- ly 25, 1989 reported that a UFO sighting had been claimed by engineer Yuriy Ponomarenko and a group of workers at a collective farm in the Dnepropetrovsk region. The object was described as a disk with two beams of light emanating from its sides. The witnesses maintained that they had observed the object on the NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 ground for about 20 minutes, and that it emitted no sound when it flew away. The August 1989 issue of the Soviet journal Nauka I Zhizn included a nine-page article which, after sum- marizing the history of UFO sightings in general, contrasted some of the views of the \"skeptics\" with some of the,opinions of the \"enthusiasts\" on the numerous reported UFO sightings in the USSR, including incidents in Serpukhov, Petrozavodsk and Rud- nya. According to the \"enthusiasts,\" UFOs have left evidence of their visits on many occasions, including the Ser- pukhov incident in which, they claim, a UFO left a circular depression in the grass with a diameter of four meters. The skeptics maintain that most of this so-called \"evidence\" can be explained as having no connection with extrater- restrial intelligence. Many of the sightings could be attributed to rocket testing, for example. Academician Vladimir Vasilyevich Migulin, director of the Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave Pro- pagation Institute in Troitsk, which has a section for the investigation of anomalous phenomena in the at- mosphere, maintains that over 90 percent of UFO sightings can be nullified by such mundane expla- nations. Stroitelnaya Gazeta of September 16, 1989 reported that in August a group of observers including physical scientist Elvir Kurchenko began in- vestigating another circular depressed area in a forest near Surgut after a worker claimed that a UFO had visited the site. Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya of September 30, 1989 noted that media all over the Soviet Union were receiving reports of UFO sightings on the ground and in the air, adding that the paper's editorial office was review- ing hundreds of reports related to UFO incidents. In response to this deluge of reports, the paper inter- viewed Anatoliy Listratov, chairman of the section of the All-Union Astronomical and Geodesic Society assigned to the study of anomalous PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The copilot was forced to leave his job due to a sudden deterioration in his health, including the onset of sudden prolonged periods of \"loss of consciousness.\" The aircraft commander died within a few months. phenomena, who said that although his group is \"still wandering around in the darkness,\" some important developments in the investigations had recently occurred. He stated that \"at the sites of the landings ... the operating frequency of a crystal- controlled oscillator changes. Simply speaking, electronic timepieces run at rates that are either too fast or too slow.\" Light Beams Listratov noted that Soviet military officers and pilots had recently started providing some documentation on UFO sightings. As an example, he stated that he had documentary in- formation regarding an encounter be- tween Soviet aircraft and a UFO over the city of Borisov. The crews of two Soviet aircraft reported seeing a large flying disk in their vicinity with five beams of light emanating from it: three beams were directed toward the ground and two were projected up- ward when the object was first sighted. The ground controller instructed one of the planes to alter its course and approach the object, at which point the disk flew to the same level and aimed one of its beams at the ap- proaching Soviet plane, illuminating the cockpit. Listratov cited the pilot's log as stating: \"At this time, the copilot was at the controls. He observed the maneuver that the object had just car- ried out and was able to raise his hand to shield himself from the unbearable light. The aircraft commander was resting in the adjoining seat, and a bright ray of light, projecting a spot with a diameter of 20 centimeters, passed across his body. Both pilots felt heat.\" According to Listratov, the aircraft commander and his copilot both became \"invalids\" shortly after the in- cident. The copilot was forced to leave his job due to a sudden deterioration in his health, including the onset of PAGE 14 sudden prolonged periods of \"loss of consciousness.\" The aircraft com- mander died within a few months. The cause of death was listed as \"cancer,\" and \"injury to the organism as a result of radiation from an unidentified flying object\" was listed as a contributing factor on the official medical record in the hospital where the commander died, according to Listratov. Listratov told Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya that about 95 percent of UFO sightings could be explained, and investigations have often revealed them to be burned-out rocket stages or the remnants of unsuccessful rocket launches. It is the 5 percent that can- not be explained that is causing all the commotion among Soviet scientists and military personnel. Instead of the widespread skepticism that he had ex- pected when he first began to inter- view military personnel, he noted that officers and soldiers had told him about their own encounters with UFOs, and they had even shown him reports that had been completely filled out on official forms. UFO Center Komsomolskaya Pravda of October 7 reported that the Soviet Union had just opened an official center for the study of UFOs in Moscow. Physicists, geologists, astronomers, and psychol- ogists are teaching courses on the various characteristics of the UFOs that have been reported and the types of equipment necessary to investigate UFO sightings. On October 9 the Soviet news agency TASS reported that a UFO had landed in a park in the city of Voronezh. TASS reported that the ob- ject had been observed by many witnesses before it left. Komsomolskaya Pravda of October 12 reported that a group of scientists had visited a field in Perm Oblast to investigate claims that a UFO had MUFON UFO JOURNAL landed in that area and had left behind a circular impression measur- ing 62 meters in diameter. Krasnaya Zvezda of October 13 suggested that mass hysteria may be an important factor contributing to the recent outburst of widespread claims of encounters with UFOs in the USSR. According to the paper, many elements of the Soviet media were fanning this phenomenon, which it compared to the hysteria resulting from Orson Welles' radio broadcast in 1938 about an invasion of the United States by extraterrestrials. The October 19-25 issue of Poisk carried an article contrasting the view- points of scientists from the two main Soviet institutes presently engaged in investigating UFO reports — the new- ly established center for UFO studies in the Palace of Culture of Power Engineers in Moscow and the Ter- restrial Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave Propagation Institute, which has branches in Troitsk, Len- ingrad and Irkutsk. Physicist Yuriy Platov of the Terrestrial Magnetism In- stitute does not believe the claims of scientists who maintain they have found remnants in Dalnegorsk of a UFO constructed by extraterrestrials, and he is convinced that the materials found at that site are really only the remnants of the unsuccessful launch of a Soviet rocket in that region. He believes that many of the other reports of UFOs can be explained by the in- ability of the observers to recognize the phenomenon known as \"ball lightning.\" Roswell The Poisk article contrasted Platov's view with that of another physical scientist, Vladimir Azhazha, who as recently elected chairman of the new All-Union Commission for the Study of Unidentified Flying Objects of the Union of Scientific and Engineering Societies. Azhazha com- pared reports of a UFO crash in the USSR with a claim by UFO en- thusiasts in the United States that a UFO had crashed in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. He believes there is sufficient evidence to support the claims of UFO crashes in both cases — in Dalnegorsk and in NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Roswell. In the latter case, he cited the testimony of eyewitnesses who main- tained that they had seen the bodies of four extraterrestrials lying near the smashed spacecraft. According to Platov, however, the eyewitnesses in the Roswell case were mistaken. He believes that the object that crashed was a USAF experimental rocket with four Rhesus monkeys aboard and that the accident was the result of an un- successful launch attempt at the dawn of the space era. Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya of Oc- tober 21 noted that hundreds of residents had reported observing a UFO in Omsk and that many of these eyewitnesses had reported the sighting directly to the paper's office in Omsk. The article included a report by an \"authoritative\" military officer, Maj. V. Loginov, who stated: \"I must tell you straight off that radar did not detect this object, and so I am report- ing visual observations. The object was passing over at an altitude of several kilometers. The visible shining sphere appeared to be about one and a half times as large as the moon's shape in the night sky. Four projec- tors — some parallel and some at angles to the Earth — were casting very bright beams. The object was in the field of vision for about five minutes ... hovering ... over the civil airport before descending a little. Then the projectors were turned off and a whirling plume trail instan- taneously appeared around this shin- ing sphere. The object began to recede rapidly in a direction from the northwest to the east at the same time that flights were being carried out from a neighboring airport. Pilots were able to observe it visually, but they could not detect it on their radar screens ... Radar signals could not be reflected from it. This object was immediately reported up the chain-of-command, and our colleagues in the Altay Kray, in the area toward which the object flew, reported back to us within five minutes that they had it under visual observation. That meant that it had covered a distance of approximately 600 kilometers at a speed of about 7,000 kilometers per hour.\" According to Loginov, all observa- tions indicated that the object was a UFO being controlled by some kind of intelligence and that it was not merely some kind of anomalous at- mospheric phenomenon. Sovetskaya Kultura of October 28 reported on the results of a con- ference in Petrozavodsk of about 100 Platov believes that the ob- ject that crashed was a USAF experimental rocket with four Rhesus monkeys aboard and that the acci- dent was the result of an un- successful launch attempt at the dawn of the space era. Soviet scientists representing the \"various branches of science and technology.\" The main topic of discus- sion was the multitude of claims of re- cent UFO sightings in the USSR. Ac- cording to Sovetskaya Kultura, more questions about UFOs were raised at this conference than were answered. Literaturnaya Gazeta of November 1 reported that Voronezh, where some observers had claimed to have witnessed the landing and take-off of a UFO has become the place for a \"pilgrimage\" by correspondents seek- ing sensational news for their newspapers, regardless of the con- troversial nature of the so-called \"weighty evidence\" being presented as proof that extraterrestrials had visited Voronezh. Current Case Log By Dan Wright Wright is MUFON's deputy direc- tor of investigations. Log # 890301. (received 3/9/89); event 12/1/86, 5 PM; duration 10 seconds; lead investigator Michael Rigg. A man was looking out a win- dow when a shiny metallic \"ball-type\" object moved into view, then dipped, slowed, sped up, circled and left in a controlled fashion. Light rain was fall- ing at the time (an uncommon occur- rence) . At an estimated 500 feet, the object seemed to be about 10 feet above the ground at its lowest point and the size of a standard car in diameter. Log # 890302.

A missile- shaped vehicle 25 feet long, light grey in color, with a slightly turned-up nose, stabilizing wings at the rear, and a reddish ring at the middle, cruised 50-100 feet above the ground at \"tremendous speed\" a few hundred feet from the witness. One possible explanation, a Tomahawk cruise missile (strikingly similar in ap- pearance), brought forward by Fran. This would postulate that a test firing (from an unknown point) had gone awry. An FOIA request for additional information's being pursued. Log # 890303.

The witness, then 8 years old, went hik- ing into a nearby woods that lie near multiple military installations. He entered a circular clearing, on the perimeter of which tree bark was scraped and hanging. At some point, from overhead a shadow became ap- parent, and the boy discovered a 60-foot disc 300 feet overhead with a high-pitched humming. The object descended while the witness felt an electrical tingling, then a blank. When he returned home, he could not ac- count for six hours. Log # 890402.

A woman entered her kitchen and heard a humming. Hovering at a distance overhead was a flat- bottomed disc. The object emitted a beam which apparently extinguished a nearby streetlight and seemingly af- fected the witness in a noticeable manner. After a few minutes the ob- ject moved out of view. Immediately after, the streetlight came back on and a firetruck soon appeared on the scene. Log # 890405.

Awakened by his dog's stirrings out- side, a man discovered a small object descending low over a nearby lot. The object was described as two con- nected discs, the lower one larger and about 3 feet in diameter. A white light shone at the top, while numerous others blinked in reddish orange and two shades of green. As the man ap- proached (intending to bring the thing back inside), the object disappeared in a flash of light. Log # 890406. (received 4/28/89); event 11/24/87; 7:30 PM, Gulf Breeze, Florida; duration 5 minutes; lead investigator Boots Eckert. A woman and her son noticed a lighted object while driving. A few moments later, it hovered over trees along the road, and they stopped to observe. The object was described as a disc with a light at the top and a row of lights or windows emanating alternate red and green light. A red ball of light dropped from the bottom, maneuvered out and up, then shot out of sight. Unnerved, the woman drove away. Log # 890407.

A couple noticed a disc-shaped object hover- ing near treetop level while driving. Slowing but not stopping, they kept it in view for over two miles. Later, having become aware of the original Gulf Breeze photos, the man declared, \"There's no doubt in my mind then or now that what we saw was exactly what was photographed on November 11 in Gulf Breeze.\" PAGE 16 The following summarizes case reports received in October and November which are well prepared and represent recent events of significance to ufology. Unless other- wise'noted, all incidents occurred at night, and no sound, vibration or odor was detected. Log # 891002. (9/3/89 event near Ebensburg, Pennsylvania); in- vestigator Paul Kessler. A high school boy confronted an arrowhead-shaped object at close range while driving. At first moving very slowly at utility line height, it accelerated while simulta- neously rotating counter-clockwise until lost from view. The vehicle was described as larger than an auto with an undercarriage surface of grey- white transected by a broad black stripe. A set of red lights were at the lead apex, a set of whitish-green lights at one rear apex, and a set of bluish lights at the other. The youth's auto did not malfunction during the 10-15 second encounter. Log # 891004. (8/26/89 event near Mineral Point, Pennsylvania); in- vestigator Paul Kessler. At 5 PM, four teenage boys resting from a game of touch football spotted a shiny object in the sky. It proceeded closer at moder- ate speed, then twice reversed direc- tion, halting momentarily each time. Fifteen minutes into the sighting, one of the boys ran home to beckon his parents outside. They were joined by several adult neighbors and watched for half an hour until the object left. It was described as a metallic sphere, at times displaying an orange-like col- oration and appearing to rotate about a vertical axis. At its closest point, the object had an apparent size of a quarter held at arm's length. Actual size was estimated as larger than the jetliner which at one point passed below the anomaly. Log # 891005. (9/9/89 event in Gulf Breeze, Florida); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A young woman and two teenage girls were driving when they noticed an oval or disc of undetermined size hovering in the distance. The object had a dull surface. A bright, steady red light on the side facing the witnesses was centered among four dimmer white lights. As they watched, four identical vehicles joined the first, forming an in- MUFON UFO JOURNAL verted \"V.\" Seconds later the five burst apart and seemed to vanish (i.e. other than moving out of view). Duration of the event was 1-2 minutes. Log # 891006. (8/18/89 or 8/19/89 event in Cantonment, Florida); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. From her front door, a woman encountered a 40-foot silvery disc resembling inverted paper plates and hovering immediately over the house across the street. A row of large steady white lights together with a row of steady red lights below formed a belt around the otherwise smooth sur- face: The object began to move slowly away. She then ran inside for a camera, but upon returning there was nothing in view. Duration of the observation was 2-3 minutes. Log # 891006. (9/14/89 event in Cantonment, Florida); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. From his bedroom, an adolescent son of the woman in the above account ob- served an object, shaped like inverted cones, approach and hover low over a house on the next street. He ran out onto the rear deck, his mother follow- ing. The object was described as at least 20 feet wide at the center and displaying 30-40 randomly spaced lights of blue, green and white. A low humming sound was detected. After a long moment, they heard a rum- bling and saw a long-nosed aircraft approaching. When directly over- head, it reversed direction (without banking) and left the area. The witnesses returned their gaze to the spot where the first object was seen, but it was gone. The duration was estimated as three minutes. [Notes: During the event, the family's three dogs, usually aggressive, hid under the deck. A work acquaintance subse- quently related having seen a long- nosed aircraft zig-zagging very low and several miles away in the same general time frame. The man sur- mised the pilot was searching the surroundings.] Log # 891007. {10/5/88 event in Gulf Breeze, Florida); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry.

While driving near an airport, a woman, her adult daughter and three granddaughters (oldest, 12 years) were driving when they ob- served a disc 200 feet away, wobbling and rising above the surrounding trees. The object was described as silver, with one white and two blue blinking lights as well as a geometric design of brown coloration. The dura- tion was ten seconds before the ter- rain blocked their view. Log # 891012. (10/9/89 event near Gulf Breeze, Florida); in- vestigator C. Joseph Barron. A woman along with two neighbors (man and adolescent boy) were target shooting with a BB gun when they noticed a glowing object approaching 300-500 feet overhead. As it passed slowly by, they heard a humming sound. They followed the object in the woman's auto, spotting it once more. As they continued to observe, the ob- ject disappeared (i.e. without moving out of view). It was described as boomerang-shaped by the woman and as conical by the man. Log # 891101. (9/11/89 event near Pickeral Lake in Kalamazoo County, Michigan); investigators Shirley and George Coyne. Two men were packing their gear after fishing when they heard the sudden barking of numerous dogs. They noticed aerial lights approaching low and slowly, then discerned an object in the shape of a cross. Four rows of red lights along with many tubes and pipes lined the underside. Its length was roughly 250 feet, with broad stubby wings near the front. As it neared the witnesses at treetop level, the vehicle halted and hovered, a low hum-whistle detected. One of the men ran into the road and stood directly under it, sensing warmth for the approximate 40 seconds it hovered over him. The object glided away, following the road. Seconds later, a truck with a spotlight flashing raced by. The witnesses proceeded to follow, keeping the object in sight. After a few miles, the object reversed its direction and again approached. They then stopped their truck and began flashing their headlights. It then made a smooth turn and headed out of sight at a fast rate. The total dura- tion was estimated as 15 minutes. Log # 891103. (10/30/89 event in Ft. Walton Beach, Florida); in- vestigator Donald Ware. Two women were viewing stars through binoculars when they noticed two rows of white lights forming a cross in the distance. A reddish, non-steady light was at the center, while an undefined outline blocked out the surrounding stars. Il- luminated somewhat by the white lights, the object's surface appeared \"grey and slick.\" After moving in an arc, the object halted and hovered momentarily, then proceeded slowly out of sight. Log # 891107. (7/2/89 event in Bellingham, Massachusetts); inves- tigator Morton Schafer. A woman was letting her dog outside when she noticed basketball-sized orange balls of light amid the typical fireflies in a wooded area bordering her back lawn. Five balls emerged and floated in formation to within 70 feet of the witness, turned to white, then changed direction in unison and glided four feet above the grass, il- luminating it as they went. She retreated inside and did not attempt to observe the lights further. In Others Words By Lucius Parish UFO sightings in Mississippi and Arkansas are the focus of an article in the November 28 issue of NA- TIONAL ENQUIRER. Police officers, pilots and others have reported various UFOs in the area during late October 1989. Another look at cattle mutilations and the seeming UFO connection is featured in the \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" column of December OM- NI. Colorado writer Peggy Noonan cites Linda M. Howe's research and her book, AN ALIEN HARVEST, as well as the opinions of skeptics. The Gulf Breeze, Florida UFO ac- tivity and controversy receives another airing in the February issue MUFON UFO JOURNAL of FATE. The opinions of various in- vestigators are given, along with a summary of the events since 1987. Loren Gross' latest entry in the UFOs: A HISTORY series of booklets is 1953: March-July. This one has 119 pages of text, plus several pages devoted to footnotes and an index.

The panel is grateful to Jenny Randies for her efforts in co- ordinating the work of the panel. It is stressed that the following symptoms should emerge spon- taneously from the witness and not be coerced out of them during investiga- tion. In other words, the witness should be aware of their apparent significance from the subjective point of view and not need to have this significance pointed out. Naturally, cases vary and it is not proposed that a claim be termed a 'potential abduction' only if all twelve of the following symptoms occur. However, it is considered by the panel that the higher the reported 'score' (i.e. the more of these twelve points in- cluded) then the more significant should the case be considered in in- vestigation and research). 1) UFO Seen: (A UFO being a stimulus considered unexplained by the witness). 2) Missing Time: (Which must be reported directly by the witness to the investigator or another verified source and be independently corroborated). 3) Anomalous Effect on the Physical Environment: (Which must be remarked upon by the witness without it being pointed out by the in- vestigator — can include sudden, unexpected and unexplained switch in physical location before, during or immediately after the event, inex- plicable marks on vehicles, etc.) 4) Change in World View Reported by Witness: (e.g. sudden interest taken in ecology, dramatic increase in scientific knowledge, unexpected spiritual outlook on life, etc.) 5) Enhanced Psychic Abilities Reported by Witness: (e.g. anomalous ESP states, sounds, sensations, feel- ings, etc., after the events.) 6) Non-Human Entities Seen: (As evaluated by the witness) 7) Anomalous Dreams Post the En- counter but Pre Any Hypnosis: (These ought to be of special significance to the witness and of questionable reality status — i.e. on dream/reality threshold. They may involve UFOs or entities, be related to the subject by the witness, be characterized by anomalous levels of emotion, obsessiveness or force- fulness or involve major unexpected changes in the subject's dreaming patterns.) 8) Anomalous Physical Injury: (Can include aborted pregnancy, puncture marks, burns, rashes or scars; ear, eye or nose disorders of unexplained origin, first noted im- mediately after the. events and recognized as anomalous by the witness.) 9) Anomalous Phobia or Irrational Emotional Responses: (These can in- clude sudden new fears of specific locations, people or types of event and circumstances, as noted by the witness in the wake of. the events.) 10) Oz Factor States of Con- sciousness: (An 'OZ Factor' state be- ing defined as 'a significant alteration in the sensory perception of a witness during an anomalous experience.' These to be spontaneously reported and cleary unusual; e.g. distortion of time passage, alterations to ambient sounds, and peculiarities of vision — e.g. traffic inexplicably vanishing.) 11) Extreme Levels of Witness Ap- prehension Concerning Disclosure of the Events (and/or desire to protect the details of a case.) 12) Inexplicable Compulsive Desire for an Explanation to be Given to them — fas evidenced by the witness upon first approach to the investigation.) — John L.

The several thousand teachers in attendance were treated to sessions on astronomy, biol- ogy, chemistry, physics, and a host of other scientific disciplines. New this year, was a special panel presentation listed under the heading of Science/ Technology/Society sessions entitled \"Using Concepts From UFO Studies to Teach Science and Critical Think- PAGE 18 ing. The panel presentation was ar- ranged by Marge Christensen, a Tuc- son high school teacher and 16-year veteran of UFO research and public education. Other participants were Dr. Michael D. Swords, Professor of Natural Sciences at Western Michigan University; Dr. Richard F. Haines, retired NASA Research Scientist; and John F. Schuessler, Aerospace Engineering Manager. This unique grouping of re- searchers representing academia, government and industry provided a MUFON UFO JOURNAL fast-moving, no-nonsense view of UFO research and its application to the field of education. The presentation by Mrs. Chris- tensen was titled \"Using the UFO Subject to Spark Students' Interest in Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, Researching and Writing.\" She shared her experiences in teaching classes of gifted and talented students by pro- viding a \"how to\" guide to use UFOs as a topic in creative problem solving.

He pointed out that we may become so concerned with \"biology,\" \"chemistry\" or \"physics\" that we may forget to teach \"science.\" That translates into producing biologists, chemists and physicists who are not scientists. His treatment of UFOs in this context had the audience excited and pressing for more information. Dr. Haines drew on his extensive background in investigating pilot reports of UFOs in his presentation entitled \"Using UFO Reports by Pilots to Illustrate Scientific Procedures.\" He did an excellent job of illustrating the seven basic steps used in science with UFO case information. John Schuessler's presentation on \"Learning Critical Thinking from the Study of Unidentified Flying Objects\" focused on the projected shortfall of 500,000 scientists and engineers in the United States by the year 2000. The need for new and innovative cur- riculum models is evident as noted by the American Association for the Ad- vancement of Science. John gave ex- amples of how this can be ac- complished by using UFOs to inspire critical thinking in students and to en- courage their scientific curiosity.

Box 277, Mount Rainier, Maryland 20712. — John Schuessler Looking Back by Bob Gribble FORTY YEARS AGO - Febru- ary 1950: All passengers and crew on an airliner said they saw a strange craft hovering over Africa's highest peak, Mount Killimanjaro in Northern Tanganyika, as they flew by on the 20th. They signed a statement to that effect after they landed in Mombasa, Kenya, from Nairobi. They described the vehicle as \"metallic, silvery and bullet-shaped,\" and said it appeared to have fins. It hovered over the 19,317-feet-high peak at about 30,000 feet for 14 minutes before moving eastward at a high rate of speed and out of sight. Two American passengers took photographs of it with a camera equipped with telescopic lens. Another passenger, Capt. H.B.B. Fussell, of Newport, Wales, photographed it with a preci- sion camera, after watching it through powerful binoculars. Fussell said: \"It reminded me a bit of an airship. After hovering around 30,000 feet, it rose to 40,000 feet, stayed still for about a minute, then flying level, sped away at a terrific rate.\" *** MUFON UFO JOURNAL THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - February 1955: A strange craft, shaped like a toy top, approached an airliner flying between Valera and Bar- quisimento, Venezuela, on the second and kept pace with the aircraft for several minutes. Confirming the in- cident, Linea Aeropostal Venezolana Airlines said the airliner, piloted by Capt. Dario Celis and First Officer P. J. Cortes, was on a scheduled flight be- tween the two cities when the crew sighted the vehicle at 11:15 a.m. The two passengers also saw it and watched it as it flew alongside. The craft looked like a large \"humming top\" with portholes in the lower sec- tion. As the vehicle flew alongside the airliner, it rotated in an anti-clockwise direction. Both pilots told reporters they had never believed in UFOs. \"But now,\" said Capt. Celis, \"not on- ly are we convinced of their existence, but also that they are controlled.\" The growing conviction in South America that the flying discs were ex- traterrestrial was suddenly given a NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 tremendous boost by a noted aviation authority from the United States. On the same day of the airliner incident over Venezuela, William P. Lear, manufacturer of aircraft and electronic equipment, told a news conference in Bogota, Columbia, that the flying discs were real. \"I believe that the UFOs come from outer space and are piloted by beings of superior in- telligence.\" He added that the discs probably come from planets outside the range of our observation. (Editor's note: William is the father of John O. Lear.) *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - Febru- ary 1960: On the night of the 15th, a Flying Tiger airliner, chartered by the Defense Department, was cruis- ing over the Pacific, transporting an Army and Air Force group to Japan. The flight was about an hour from Tokyo when the cockpit radar picked up three large fast-moving objects. At first, the radar operator and pilots thought the set had malfunctioned — they had never seen such huge blips on a radarscope. Then a reddish glow appeared in the sky, above and to the left. Staring upward, the captain saw three, enormous oval-shaped craft. Descending at high speed, in close formation, they seemed to be heading straight at the plane. The captain nastily started to turn, then stopped. The three giant vehicles, veering to one side, had abruptly reduced speed. Now they were leveling out at the plane's alti- tude, still in close formation. The radar showed they were five miles away, but even at that distance they looked gigantic. For several minutes, the Fly- ing Tiger crew tensely watched the three glowing craft. Though they made no attempt to come closer, their formidable size made them seem menacing. As the giant vehicles continued to pace the airliner, the captain sent a crewman back into the cabin. In a few moments, he returned with an Air Force officer. The Flying Tiger captain had hoped that an emergency message might bring jets from Okinawa, in case of trouble. But the Air Force man, after an amazed in- PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"spection of the huge craft, advised him not to try it. For several minutes more, the giant vehicles kept pacing the plane. Then, the formation angled abruptly upward. Accelerating to 1200 knots, the craft disappeared in a few seconds. The Air Force officer, who had observed the huge vehicles, estimated their size, using the five-mile distance as a basis. If he were correct, the three craft must have been near- ly 2000 feet in length, possibly even more. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - Feb- ruary 1975: A brilliantly colored ob- ject, with \"an antenna protruding from the top,\" hovered above a U.S. Air Force Missile installation in Montana about 9 p.m. on the 17th — dazzling a sheriff, three deputies, a county commissioner and a game warden. The sighting took place near an ICBM base called Kilo One in Wheatland County. County Sheriff Richard Egebakken, stationed in Harlowton, only three miles from the missiles, declared: \"It was almost as if the craft was attracted to the missiles. That was the exact area where it was hovering. It hung in the sky over Kilo One. It was round, with a definite bulk to it. The vehicle was the size of a commer- cial aircraft. It seemed to stop and start a lot and sometimes reached terrific speed.\" The strange craft's appearance near Harlowton followed sightings that had lasted for more than three hours in two other locations. The first time it was seen was 60 miles to the east, at Roundup, followed by reports of the object hovering over Shawmut, about 20 miles southeast of Harlowton. At headquarters in Harlowton, Deputy Larry Clifford received a report of the object and drove to a point about a mile from the vehicle. \"The object was only about 500 feet off the ground,\" said Clifford, \"and it was many times brighter than a star. Suddenly it shot up to an altitude of about 2000 feet, then stopped dead in its tracks near the Kilo One missle site. After watch- ing it for almost two hours, I saw it disappear into the clouds.\" Edgar Langston, a long-time com- missioner of Wheatland County and PAGE 20 a qualified pilot, spotted the craft from his ranch, 15 miles south of Harlowton. \"I got my field glasses to look at it,\" he said. \"It climbed at one hell of an angle — moving too fast and steeply to be an aircraft. I could make out what seemed to be an antenna protruding from the top. And there seemed to be a circular, black spot on the underside of the thing.\" Veteran state game warden Gene Tierney met up with Deputy Larry Clifford outside Harlowton, and they watched the vehicle. Said Tierney: \"I've never seen anything like it, even though I've done a lot of flying, in- cluding at night. I don't know what it was — but it wasn't an aircraft.\" Special Deputy Herb Lynn was in his pickup truck a few miles outside Harlowton when he spotted the craft. \"I stopped my vehicle and sat there mystified,\" he said. \"The craft drop- ped like a stone, then shot back up. It flitted around the sky, in all kinds of crazy directions.\" Deputy Russ Mull, who drove to within a mile of the Kilo One site, said: \"The vehicle was bright blue and bobbing up and down near the missile station.\" Capt. John Hig- ginbottom, at the Great Falls, Mon- tana Air Force Base, said:: \"We had no radar reading on whatever this thing was. But these witnesses sound pretty reliable.\" A lieutenant at the base added: \"Two security guards, at Kilo One, reported seeing something large in the sky. We have been un- able to determine what the object was.\" About 2 a.m. the following day, several Air Force policemen from the Kilo One site reported they had spot- ted another craft hovering over Kilo Ten site, which is located seven miles north of Harlowton airport. Two fishermen sighted two strange objects in the sky at Lake Sorell, Tasmania, Australia, on the 26th. The two craft stood out clearly in the night sky, when suddenly one of them headed toward the fisherman's loca- tion. The vehicle stopped about 1000 yards away and 500 feet above the lake. They estimated the size of the vehicle to be no less than 200 feet in diameter. During the next few minutes the craft turned on a MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"monstrous light\" which was directed down toward the lake. The shaft of light was well defined and half the diameter of the vehicle itself. The spill of light from around the main shaft illuminated a distance of IVz miles around the lake. The beam swung back and forth in an arc. It seemed like a careful search of the Robinson's Swamp area was being conducted by the vehicle. Following its \"inspection\" of the area, the craft turned off its gigantic light beam, after which a blue-white phosphoresence was left hanging about 30 feet above the lake's surface. The vehicle then departed in a flash; It was \"like watching a tracer bullet going away from you.\" *** TEN YEARS AGO - February 1980: It was about 11:30 p.m. on the llth, when the bridge game broke up at a house south of Council Bluffs, Iowa. One of the eight card players, described as \"extremely level headed,\" was driving home when the car engine stalled, the lights went out, and the radio went off. It was 11:40 p.m. She got out of the car, saw headlights coming up the road and decided to try to move her car. The engine started immediately and she drove toward home. She drove a quarter of a mile and the engine stalled again. As she opened her car door, she froze. \"I was petrified, like a rock,\" she said. In the cornfield to her left, about 300 yards from the road, a bright orange light was shin- ing at her. \"I couldn't look into the light be- cause it was too bright. It was brighter than a railroad flare, really bright.\" She jumped into the car and locked the door. At this point, her recollection becomes fuzzy. \"I don't know what happened,\" she said. \"I can't even make up a story. I just don't know what happened after that.\" She does recall turning the key, however. The engine started and she drove home. She ran into her house, went to the bathroom, turned on the light and looked in the mirror. She was hor- rified. \"My face and hands were pink, like the color of a healed scar. And my face was blotchy. Not raised, but pink, about the size of a thumbprint.\" NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Her temperature was 102, she said, and her head was swimming. \"My stomach was upset. I had diarrhea. I was sweating. If you have ever seen anyone in profound shock, it was me. I thought I was marred for life.\" The redness didn't cover her chin and neck. It was as if a line had been drawn from one ear lobe to the other, crossing under her nose, she said. She had pulled her coat up around her neck when she got out of the car. Only the exposed parts of her hands and face were red. By 4 a.m., she said, the redness and blotches began to fade. They were gone by 4:20 a.m. The woman had no explanation for the lost time. It was about a five minute drive to her home; that night it had taken her 32 minutes to make the trip. Eleven-year-old Scott Knirtle and his mother, Beverly Cowan, had a close look at a strange object seen by many residents of Ovid, New York, on the 18th. Around 9:45 p.m., \"I was just laying in my bed and then this light came through my window and made everything orange,\" said Knit- tie. At first, he thought it was moonlight. But when he took a closer look \"there was this oval-shaped thing with about 10 openings straight across it,\" hovering over the field in back of his home. It was then he called his mother. When she entered the bedroom, Mrs. Cowan said, \"The room had an orange cast ... and I went over to the window and this thing was up in the air, about 30 feet off the ground and 150 feet away.\" The craft, she said, was egg-shaped\" and about five feet wide. Seconds later, the vehicle shot straight up in the air. Later, Mrs. Cowan discovered her son's eyes were bloodshot. WORDS, Continued call for complete lists. Bill Hamilton's book, ALIEN MAGIC, is an interesting potpourri of materials relating to rumors of crashed discs, alien/government interactions and bases, contactee stories, etc. Bill has been following the UFO subject for the past 36 years and has had some fascinating experiences during that period of time. To me, the most interesting portions of ALIEN MAGIC are those in which he recalls the ear- ly days of California \"saucer-ology\" in the 1950's. Some of the other material is questionable (at best!) and some I regard as total fiction, but Bill is not passing judgements, just presenting information so that the readers can decide its value for themselves. The book has numerous illustrations and such a variety of sub- jects that it would be difficult not to find something of interest in it. The price is $20.00 and copies may be ordered from UFORCES - Box 1554 - Lancaster, CA 93539-1554.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"1989 MUFON Symposium Tkpes Hal Starr, representing the Mutual UFO Network, signed a contract with Ronald Regehr to produce both video and audio tapes of the official speakers at the MUFON 1989 Inter- national UFO Symposium in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Aladdin Hotel. Advance orders were taken at the symposium and thereafter for both audio and video tapes. Due to video camera problems, a large portion of the audio was missing from the original video tape. With great difficul- ty, Ron was able to dub an audio tape onto the video tape by synchronizing the speed to match the speakers' lip movements. This obviously delayed the delivery of the initial orders. MUFON in Seguin, TX and Hal Starr in Phoenix, AZ have received many complaints of late delivery of orders and others due to poor quali- ty tapes. To speed up the delivery of audio tapes, Hal Starr has taken over that responsibility, so all inquiries con- cerning audio tapes should be directed to him at 312 West Frier Drive, Phoenix, AZ 85021 or telephone (602) 944-4211. Considering the time that has elapsed in the delivery of video tapes or the quality of same, all such com- plaints should be directed to Ronald Regehr, 8855 Atlanta - Suite #114, Huntington Beach, CA 92646 or telephone - Business: (818) 812-1707 or Home: (714) 536-7335. We feel that Mr. Regehr has been delinquent in fulfilling the contract that he signed with the Mutual UFO Network. We apologize for the problems created to our members, however, we ask for your patience in order to give Mr. Regehr an opportunity to satisfac- torily complete his contract. Consider- ing the poor illumination of the speakers' lecture during slide presen- tations, this factor was detrimental and cannot be corrected. All refunds for bad quality tapes must be han- dled with Mr. Regehr (not MUFON) by returning the video tape with your letter of explanation. PAGE 22 The Night Sky By Walter N. Webb March 1990 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -2.2), in Gemini, appears high in the sky and due south at dusk. The giant moves westward during the evening. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.4) arrives at a point in its orbit farthest west of the Sun on the 30th. At that time the planet resembles a half Moon in a small telescope. Rising shortly before 4 AM in mid-March, the brightest planet can be seen in the SE at dawn. It is near the crescent Moon on the 23rd. Mars (magnitude 1.1) moves from Sagittarius into Gapricornus. The red planet rises about the same time as Venus and can be found west and south of its brilliant neighbor. Mars is very near the crescent Moon on March 22 and in fact is occulted (hidden) later that morning (unfortunately during broad daylight) in the central and western U.S. Jupiter sets in the NW about 2 AM in midmonth. Saturn (magnitude 0.6), in Sagittarius, rises about 3 AM in mid-March and lies west of Mars and Venus in the SE dawn sky. The ringed planet appears near the Moon on March 21. Hubble Space Telescope: After many delays, the Hubble Space Telescope finally is scheduled for its launch from the space shuttle late this month. (There could be further postponements.) The 13-ton satellite will detect celestial objects 50 times fainter and 7 times farther than Earth-based optical telescopes. A 94.5-inch mirror directs light to any of 5 instruments which will study, in several wavelengths, the detailed structure of objects ranging from planets and comets to black holes and distant quasars and galaxies. After a 7-month checkout period, the HST is expected to operate in Earth orbit for up to 15 years. Moon Phases: First quarter — March 3 Full moon — March 11 Last quarter — March 19 New moon — March 26 The Stars: The Winter Circle, which surrounds Orion the Hunter, now occupies the SW sky at 9 PM. Meanwhile that heavenly sign of spring, Leo the Lion, advances in the SE toward the meridian. Below Leo lies the longest (also one of the faintest) constellation in the sky, Hydra the Sea Serpent. The monster's 5-starred head is located be- tween Regulus (in Leo) and Procyon (in Canis Minor). Not far below his head lies the star Alphard (aptly meaning \"the solitary one\"), the only fairly bright star in the whole rambling constellation. You will have to wait until around midnight in order to trace the entire outline of the serpent; its tail ends below Virgo and Libra. Riding on top of Hydra's writhing coils are 3 other equally obscure pat- terns — from west to east, Sextans the Sextant, Crater the Cup, and Cor- vus the Crow. On March 2 the Moon occults some of the stars in the Pleiades cluster at around 11 PM (EST). € O MUFON UFO JOURNAL NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued broadcasts, in which I have par- ticipated as a guest, have been phenomenal; far exceeding any similar responses following similar na- tional TV or radio appearances.

Walters' New Book The Gulf Breeze Sightings: The Most Astounding Multiple Sightings of UFOs in U.S. History, by Edward and Frances Walters will be released in hardback on March 19, 1990, by William Morrow Company (New York, NY). The foreword is by Budd Hopkins and the photo analysis by Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D. Statements by Donald M. Ware and Walter H. Andrus, Jr. are included in the text. A large number of the photographs will be published in color, which was recommended by some of Ed's col- leagues. (We were unable to do them justice when published in black and white in the MUFON UFO JOUR- NAL.) At the urging of Edward Walters, the publishers have obtain- ed an independent computer en- hanced study of the photographs to document their authenticity. A highly respected book reviewing firm has read the manuscript supplied by William Morrow Company of the Walters' book and given it a very favorable recommendation surpassing previous UFO books that later became best sellers. The senior editor at William Morrow was elated and sent Ed a copy of the review. We hope to publish this distinguished review in the February issue of the Journal. Those of us in MUFON who worked closely in the investigation were instrumental in encouraging Ed to record his experiences for a book. Starting with the first article in the Journal, March 1988, following my first trip to Gulf Breeze during the middle of January 1988, I predicted, much to the dismay of a few skeptics, that the Gulf Breeze Case would NO. 262 FEBRUARY 1990 become the most important UFO case during the past 40 years. I feel that my prediction has been vindicated by the facts disclosed during the on- going investigation. Our congratula- tions are extended to Ed and Frances Walters, for having the intestinal for- titude to not only maintain their family composure and disposition under such disrupting conditions created by the visitations, but their integrity to defy and respond to a few of the rude and unsavory critics. Potentially, The Gulf Breeze Sightings has all of the attributes to become a best seller when compared with books like Communion, which also attained that lofty peak. Ms. Cheyenne Turner, President of MUFON Metroplex in Dallas, TX, has scheduled Edward Walters to speak at their monthly meeting on Saturday, March 24, 1990 during his William Morrow Company book promotion tour. Mr. Walters will speak at 7:30 p.m. at the Garland Center for the Performing Arts at 5th and Austin streets in the Garland suburb of Dallas. The public is welcome.

New Officers The substantial and healthy growth of MUFON was reflected in the 2425 copies of the January 1990 issue that were published. In order to stay abreast of the expanding respon- sibilities, the following new officers volunteered their services and exper- tise: Francis L. Ridge, Indiana State Director, appointed Michael J. Rigg (Griffith) to become Asst. State Direc- tor, replacing Jerry L. Sievers (Vincennes), both continuing as State Section Directors. Thomas P. Stults, Illinois State Director, selected two new State Section Directors: Jim PAGE 24 Houran (Decatur) for Macon, Dewitt and Piatt Counties and Barry Dameron (Fairbury) for Livingston, Iroquis and McLean Counties. Shir- ley A. Coyne, Michigan State Direc- tor, reassigned Rex W. Schrader, Jr. (Lansing) to Ingham, Eaton and Clin- ton Counties. Stan Gordon, Penn- sylvania State Director, approved the appointment of David N. Blaker (Wilkes-Barre) for Luzerne County. Burtus \"Jeff\" Ballard, State Director for Alabama promoted Paul L.

Your Director accepted the invitation to attend, representing the Mutual UFO Network. Astronaut Survey An ambitious public relations pro- ject was spearheaded by Robert H. Bletchman, in January, seeking the support of both past and present astronauts for recommendations made by former astronaut Dr. Brian O'Leary in his press conference release for a \"Congressional Investiga- tion of UFOs\" at the Penta Hotel in New York City on October 6, 1989. MUFON mailed copies of Dr. O'Leary's news release, \"A Brief History of UFOs and Congress,\" prepared by Dennis Stacy, a MUFON Resume, and a check-off and signature form to be returned to MUFON by each of the 134 recipients expressing their opinion pro or con. We fully recognize that the present astronaut's future in the space pro- gram hinges upon Congressional allocation of funds, however former astronauts, now in civilian life, may be inclined to speak more freely. Yes, we admit it is an ambitious undertaking, however, the responses may be favorable and enlightening. On the other hand, we would be negligent if we didn't capitalize upon this oppor- tunity. The results of this astronaut survey will be published in a future issue of the Journal.
