Andrus, Jr. After a benefactor had agreed to finance a DNA bone analysis of the skeleton and a spectrographic analysis of the metal links of the vest, I felt that it was imperative that further investigation of the authenticity of the small skeleton be established before the money was spent. Since Bob Slaughter died of cancer on March 24, 1998, just two months before I became aware of the unique skel- eton, it was impossible for me to probe him for details on its authenticity. The significant implications that the skeleton might be an extraterrestrial justified further research. Such a find would be the breakthrough of the century for ufology. Since Bob's widow, Judith Slaughter, had been mar- ried to him only a little over two years, she had no knowl- edge of the actual recovery of the skeleton and of it being mounted in a plaster of paris display. Therefore, using the names of the people mentioned in Professor Slaughter's book, Fossil Remains of Mythi- cal Creatures, I proceeded to document the case of the small humanoid skeleton. (This is a follow-up on the ar- ticle titled \"The Alien?\" that appeared in the March 1999 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal.) The investigation Since George Toomer, Sr. had written the six-page in- troduction to Bob Slaughter's book, this was a likely point to start the investigation. A telephone call to him in Dal- las, TX, disclosed that he indeed was a good friend of Bob, and had written the lighthearted and somewhat hu- morous introduction. He identified himself in the book as \"Eliade Professor of Comparative Religion, Ladonia University.\" This pro- vocative title created questions, because there is no reg-. istered Ladonia University in Ladonia, TX. Actually the group of people involved is a little like Dr. J. Allen Hynek's \"Invisible College\" in ufology, except that this was an art colony operated by Bob Slaughter and his former wife, Juliana Bemier. Mr. Toomer could not testify to the credibility of the book. However, this quotation from his introduction may shed light upon his thoughts: \"...we realize that man is just a Guy, a silly fellow looking for a little extra help from Neptune, mermaids, and fairies-a pot of gold hid- den by a tiny man in green or the answers to a prayer to quell fear and suffering. It's only human to believe.\" George Toomer does have an interest in ufology, as did Bob Slaughter. On April 14 , my wife and I drove to Ladonia. TX, to interview and visit with people who knew Professor Slaughter personally as a means of getting to the bottom of this intriguing case. The book doesn't say when the skeleton was found fl /jinES.^ >«» --W;'*- ><S& ^&&^ &—f&^. The old cotton gin, which had been converted to apartments and studios for an art colony, is appar- ently where Bob Slaughter created the \"alien.\" along the \"Old Davis Creek\" by Richard Wallace; there- fore, I went to the Ladonia City Hall to ascertain when the Corps of Engineers excavated and created the new channel leading through the cotton fields to the North Sulphur River. Taking ten years to complete, the rechan- neling started in the early 1920's, according to long time residents of Ladonia. When I asked some of these same people who knew Bob Slaughter whether they thought the skeleton was authentic or a hoax, Robert Bledsoe said it was a myth; Leon Hursh believed the skeleton to be authentic; and Vee Bledsoe (wife of Robert) said it was a hoax. Vee Bledsoe said she was present at the art colony in the old cotton gin building where she saw Bob Slaughter assemble fossils and other skeletons that appear in his book. However, she did not see the \"alien skeleton\" be- ing assembled. Mrs. Bledsoe volunteered to accompany my wife and me to the former cotton gin that had been converted to apartments and studios by Bob Slaughter and Juliana Bemier as an art colony. The caretakers were not at home when the three of us arrived, so we were unable to enter the main building housing the apartments and studios. An outside covered work area disclosed many ex- amples of Bob Slaughter's work that appears in the book and other \"work in process.\" Molds for making other mythical creatures were scattered around on various work benches. Ethel McFarland's letters The source of the information for connecting the re- covery of the skeleton with the infamous Aurora, TX, mysterious airship crash in April 1897 was an alleged letter from Luther Mallow to his lady friend Ethel McFarland in Ladonia. Peter Betters (403 Main St., Ladonia, TX) purchased the ten-room home built in 1900 from the estate of Ethel McFarland in 1991, and he and his wife Janie have been restoring it as their residence."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 June 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Peter Betters, left, and Walt Andrus. Ethel McFarland died in 1985 or 1986. Seeking possible evidence of the alleged encounter of two craft and little men with Luther Mallow on April 16, 1897, 1 went to Peter Betters' home for an interview. I had hoped to secure the original letter or a Xerox copy of same. Indeed, Peter Betters had found many let- ters from Mr. Mallow to Miss McFarland when he pur- chased the home, but to my disappointment, there was no such letter about the purported mysterious airships in 1897 near Ladonia to confirm Bob Slaughter's story. Due to his interest in UFOs, Professor Slaughter had apparently concocted the non-existent letter from S.E. Hayden's Dallas Morning News article about the Aurora, TX, mysterious airship crash. Peter Betters had known Bob Slaughter since 1991 when he and his wife pur- chased the McFarland residence in Ladonia. Mr. Slaughter stated that an avid collector, geologist Richard Wallace, brought him the distal end of a tibia (lower leg bone) for identification. This supposedly led to the excavation of the skeleton in question along the steep bank of the North Sulphur River. Park created Due to the large quantity of cretaceous and Pleistocene deposits in this immediate area, a park has been created, courtesy of Texas Parks and Wildlife and the citizens of Ladonia, named \"Pete Patterson Fossil Gorge Park.\" Of the people interviewed in Ladonia during my visit, no one had heard of Richard Wallace, who supposedly had found the leg bone of the skeleton. Apparently this may have been a fictitious name; like the non-existent letter from Luther Mallow to Ethel McFarland. Aurora airship crash of 1897 An oversight by the editors of the Journal did not give proper credit to the \"MUFON Forum\" article by George W. Earley last month in his reply titled \"The Alien,\" for which we apologize. Mr. Earley poses the question \"why Walt Andrus seemingly endorses the Aurora Airship Crash when no reputable historian-ufologist or other- has done so?\" The answer is very simple. Only one of the \"armchair ufologists\" mentioned has done an in-depth study of the case except myself. For his book, The Great Texas Air- ship Mystery, Wallace O. Chariton spent a day in Seguin, TX , reviewing our extensive file on the subject. (Wally must be commended for his research.) Space does not permit me to elaborate further in this article. However, one of my pet peeves concerns \"armchair ufologists\" quoting other \"armchair ufologists\" as evidence when neither has performed an on-site investigation as I have done since 1973. Conclusion As I promised Journal readers, they would be the first to know about the authenticity of the interesting skel- eton. Of course, the obvious question is why a reputable and renowned paleontologist would author a book that contained for all practical purposes fictitious cases and purported mythical creatures. A book containing 143 pages, 28 chapters, and 82 illustrations is no small task to create, especially if each mythical creature is prepared with a case history and classification. A quotation from the \"conclusions\" may give a clue to Professor Slaughter's philosophy for publishing his book: \"Another sobering thought is that these creatures probably do not, and have not, existed outside of human minds at all. The human mind is an amazing and, we think, unique organ capable of creating almost anything he/she wants. As Mircea Eliade pointed out, until a few decades ago western scholars thought of myth as fables, fiction, invention, etc. In these more enlightened times, ethnolo- gists, sociologists, anthropologists, historians of religion, and others interested in myth, acknowledge that in many societies myth means 'true story.'\" Vee Bledsoe, one of the interviewees, believes the book was authored to teach children about myths. Someone else suggested that it was a \"spoof perpetrated upon his fellow paleontologists in a humorous manner. In the case of the \"alien\" skeleton, it was just waiting for a ufologist to seize upon the similarities to an extraterrestrial. Bob used actual bones and artifacts to create an illu- sion. Where did the skull and the four-finger, four-toe bones come from? There are still a few questions to be answered. Judith Slaughter still plans to donate her husband's artwork to the MUFON museum, and, yes, we will be very glad to give it an appropriate home."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1999 PageS Part II: SOM 1-01 The other side of MJ-12 ByTomDeuley © Now on to SOM 1-01. I was one of the people that Don Berliner had sent the document to when he first got it. This was well before Stanton Friedman was even aware of its existence, let alone Bob Wood. My initial impression of the document was based on three pages faxed to me by Don Ber- liner. My opinion then and now was that it was not only not a \"Top Secret\" document, but that it had never even sat on a shelf next to a Top Secret docu- ment. I was of the opinion that someone had taken an existing Tom Deuley document and cut and pasted and retyped it to suit their desires-including raised z's, which are easy to create. My idea at the time was to keep the thing out of the UFO community until it could be absolutely verified or disproved. However, through circumstances beyond our con- trol, as mentioned above, control of the document was lost, wherein it became obvious to me that what we now had was another document running loose in the UFO community that would find a life of its own and there was nothing we could do about it. I pretty much closed out my interest in the SOM 1-01. Keep in mind that the validity of this document de- pends entirely on the reality of the original EBD MJ- 12 document, which I have pointed out has a serious problem. Once control of the situation was out of hand, I wrote the following two letters and sent the second one to those who I knew to have an interest, including Bob Wood. Note the dates. 2827 Sir Phillip Dr. San Antonio, TX 78209-4236 9 October 1995 Dear I recently received the letter from Jim Westwood arguing for the use of the term \"Downed Satellite.\" I do not believe the argument to be suffi- About the Author Tom Deuley joined MUFON in 1977 as a Field Investigator and State Section Director in North Carolina. After moving to San Antonio, TX, he was elected to the MUFON Executive Commit- tee and Board of Directors as Corporate Secretary, and is Assistant to the International Director. Tom served as Texas State Director from 1984 until 1993, and organized the MUFON San Antonio Chapter. He served on the National Board of Direc- tors for the Fund for UFO Research since its incep- tion. He is the author of Chapter XVI, \"Radiation Survey of Landing Cases,\" for the Fourth Edition of the MUFON Field In vestigator 's Manual. Tom has been a board member of the UFO Research Coa- lition since it was organized in 1994. He is a veteran of the Navy, serving as both an enlisted man and officer, receiving his commis- sion in 1972 after earning the B.S.E.E. from Au- burn. His service included assignment to a nuclear submarine. Tom retired from the Navy as a lieu- tenant commander. cient. I, myself, would not accept this usage until it has been thoroughly researched and proven to have been a term in usage at the time. Regardless of the amount of history the term \"satellite\" had prior to 7 April 1954, it would have had to have been in general usage to have appeared in a document of this nature; otherwise no one would have known what the author was talking about. Rather than present lengthy argu- ments of why it has to be OK, why not have several practicing and knowledgeable lexicographers give us the definitive history of the two-word term as they see and list it. The problem I am having here is an argument seem- ingly leading me to conclude that the author of this document was the person who coined this term several years before it would mean anything in the real world and several years before it was in any general usage. I doubt both. Attached are a collection of comments I have been working on since I first saw a faxed copy of a few of the pages. I have found many problems in just the first two pages; when the remainder of the document is available to me in a high quality form I will continue to comment, page for page. In addition, when I can get a certified copy of the Air Force letter that stated that this document is a fake, I will begin to show it around to a wide variety of active and retired military personnel who will have had the background to com- ment on both the content, the context and the format. My background for commenting on this document, as is attached, is from the point of view of a COMSEC"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 June 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Analyst, a COMSEC Custodian, and from the point of view of a COMSEC Auditor who has participated in the auditing of large COMSEC accounts. The term COMSEC is the short form of \"Communication Se- curity.\" It is the overall term that covers all aspects of physical and electronics security, including the care and feeding of all classified documents at all levels. This would include the production, storage, upkeep, updat- ing, application of proper classification, proper declas- sification and eventual destruction of classified matter of all forms. In that capacity I found that every classi- fied document is produced with the idea in mind that the owners would be able to trace its whereabouts at every minute of its existence until it is destroyed or declassified. From what I saw, our government does an excellent job of this. For insurance, documents and materials of higher classifications have special provi- sions attached to them to reassure the ability to trace them and to verify their integrity. Today every page of every highly classified document is uniquely numbered and marked and is then photographed so that each page is recorded and is individually traceable for its entire life. Similar practices at a lower level have long been in use. Since this document is supposed to have had espe- cially high sensitivity, one would expect that it had been very specially produced to meet that high level of sen- sitivity. In general it does only a poor job of showing any special precautions, and that is only the beginning. I will continue to work on this as time permits and I will include you all as I go along. Respectfully Tom Deuley Initial Analysis of an alleged government document. \"THE COVER\" or inside cover, which ever it may be. Use of the \"RESTRICTED\" marking. It appears as a hand stamped marking that on the original would be in red or magenta, but because I see it here I would expect to also find it on the bottom of the page, as well, and on each of the following pages. In addition I do not recall that \"Restricted\" was used alone, and when it was used, it was for nuclear related information. I find the numerical title \"SOM 1-01\" to be odd. If this is a short title to indicate the numbering of Stan- dard (Special) Operating Manuals, I don't think that this would be number 1 in the series of all SOMs. This marking appears to be an imitation in any case, with an attempt (with the 1 of 1 connotation) to make it look very (overly) important. If it is real it will fit into an existing system of the time; if it is not real, it is probably an imitation of something that was or is real, and that was thus a model for the fake. In either case it should be possible to pin down the time frame of the original. On the subject of short titles, the document does not show an unclassified short title. A big problem for a Top Secret document. The marking \"TO 12D1-3-11-1.\" It would be inter- esting to know what this breaks out as. This again alludes to a series, or some other numbering system that should be traceable to some Department or Branch. For me I see too many \"1 's\", and I am not happy with the!2(MJ12). The use of \"GROUP\" in the attribution. The word \"group\" indicates a portion of some larger organiza- tion, i.e. \"Operations Group\" or \"Intelligence Group\" or other. I don't think it fits here in that the MAJES- TIC -12 was alleged to be organized directly under the President of the United States, which would have been a Department at the level of \"Department of ,\" and the Group level should be at least two or three layers, or so, lower. Again this looks like imitation, for the sake of imitation. The type setting in the \"EXTRATERRESTRIAL...\" is amateurish in that the letter spacing (kerning) is not the work of a professional. Likewise in the \"TOP SE- CRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY.\" The title \"EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENTITIES AND TECHNOLOGY, RECOVERY AND DISPOSAL\" The use of the word \"entities\" bothers me, as it has where it has shown up before in old alleged documents. More disturbing is the use of the word \"DISPOSAL.\" One, it is a poor choice of words, unless you're clean- ing up a land fill, and there is nothing in the Table of Contents that even alludes to \"DISPOSAL.\" I would tend to doubt that it shows up in the text either. The block of type in \"WARNING! This...\" ends with a single word on the last line, a short word at that. In printing jargon, this is called a \"widow,\" and again this is something a professional printer would not have allowed. In desktop publishing, a 1980's and up phe- nomena, you see this a lot-because they do not know any better. In the \"WARNING\" information, reference is made to \"... strictly limited to personnel possessing a MAJIC -12 CLEARANCE LEVEL.\" MAJIC would not be a clearance level. The clearance levels are: Unclassi- fied, Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. If MAJIC is anything, it is a code word, and in this case it would be making reference to a compartment. Information below this area was not clear enough to comment on, but should have contained information which would have allowed the printer to find the origi-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1999 Page? nal job information and plates. However, this informa- tion may be in the binding area. Of particular note is the fact that there is nothing on this cover to indicate that this document is serialized in any manner. So far as I have ever seen, every Top Secret document has some form of serial numbering system for the purpose of auditing, inventory, and ac- counting. This alone is enough to tell me that this is not a Top Secret document, and if it is a fake made from some real document, it was not Top Secret either. There is no page number on the cover or an entry on the cover to show it to be the cover, yet it would be an accountable page. There is no marking that this is the original cover page to distinguish it from subsequent replacement of a changed cover page. PAGE 2 Table of Contents page. TOP SECRET / MAJIC EYES ONLY on the top of the page -1 would expect this to be in red or magenta on an original and I would expect to also see it at the bottom of the page. Quality photos on good film should show this print to be a dark grey, as compared to other black areas. It would at least have the \"Top Secret\" stamped or printed at the bottom. The top of the page looks crowded, as if the printer did not know he needed to leave room for the over stamp / over print. There is no page number but subsequent pages show it to be page 1. There is no \"Original\" marking. This too would be an accountable page requiring some unique trace- able markings. There is no title line for the Table of Contents. I would expect to see one. Chapter 1 has only one Section. I would expect to see at least two Sections before anything was broken into sections. Also Chapter 4. Again, there is no reference here to a serial number. Within the table of contents \"Possible Origins\" is in Chapter 6, a technical chapter, it looks more like it belongs in Chapter 5. There is no listing for a \"page change page\" or any reference to a signature page. Nor is there any evi- dence of a signature page, which is a part of every Top Secret document. The page would list everyone who has seen it up to that point in time. Again a major flaw. The page change page would have also listed every time a page was added, removed, or changed. Also missing is any mention of an audit signature page. That would be a minimum of once per year, sometimes more often. COMMENT made to others I have sent the above to: In this review of just the first two pages you can see that there are many more questions than whether or not the term \"Downed Satellite\" has a \"Go / No Go\" relevance. I am looking forward to additional reviews of these two pages, and subsequent pages, with additional ex- pertise as an aid. It should prove most interesting. I am some few years away from the business of re- viewing TS material. I feel sure, however, that some- one more practiced than myself would correct some of my possible errors, but would find two new errors for the ones I have miss-called. There are many people out there in the public realm who can shed light on this document, particularly since it has been declared a fake by the Air Force. Many of those who could assist live in the Washington D.C. area and should be called upon for their expertise. We should not be afraid to find out if this document is a fake; as well, we should not be afraid to find out if it is genuine; we should, however, be afraid of not knowing the truth. In spite of objections I asked that you note the-dates to show that since I sent this out several years ago, people who got copies have since authored positive information about the SOM 01-1. They have done so with the pretense that no one, especially within the UFO community, has ever stepped forward to even speculate that the SOM 01-1 could be anything but genuine. When Bob Wood re- fers to \"Skeptics,\" he is not necessarily talking about our usual \"anti-UFO Skeptics.\" He is also talking about a lot of people within the UFO Community that just don't happen to agree with him. And of course we UFOers do not particularly care to be thrown in with the \"Skeptics.\" In any case, I hereby do make the pronouncement that I think this document is a fake based on the infor- mation in this 1995 letter. The letter was apparently ignored in order to keep my professional considered opinion from muddling the situation for those who wanted to believe the document is genuine. If you have your mind made up, don't let the facts get in your way. I have seen or have heard of several arguments among the proponents, in more recent years, as if my professional opinion did not count or did not mean anything. I mention this because I do not know of any- one being involved in this case that has any more back- ground or knowledge of \"Top Secret\" documents than I do. If there is anyone out there to dispute me, please step up and lets talk about it. The only other person I know of who has had an interest in this, and who has the background with Top Secret material, agrees with me that it is very likely a fraud. As for Timothy Cooper as a source of allegedly valid documents appearing anonymously in his mail box, the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS June 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Fund for UFO Research years ago gave him a small grant to investigate and search out documents in the New Mexico area. But his preliminary report was so poorly constructed and so flill of speculation that the Fund killed the project. So he is not so new to the scene as is portrayed in the article. Bob Wood, and especially Timothy Cooper, tries to add support to the crash on the Texas-Mexico border in one of the documents, and, as I have already said, it is a non-case. No UFO crashed on the Texas-Mexico border. How can a document support something that didn't happen? The other thing that bothers me about Timothy Coo- per is that Timothy Good, in England, has stated in an interview that he has doubts about the new MJ-12 stuff ... since the so-called MJ 1st Annual Report is iden- tical in typeface and style to a couple of letters to him from Timothy Cooper in 1991. What more needs to be said? There is an element out there that thinks all of the people in the UFO business are a bunch of gullible nuts and flakes who believe everything that comes along, but that is not the case. MUFON has a lot of expertise available to it, and it is not unusual for \"junk\" to come into the office that is readily recognized as such, and it is not necessarily unusual for MUFON to call on a consultant to give an opinion on something that may seem to have a modicum of credibility. In short it is worthwhile checking with someone who might know. MUFON can do that. As an extreme example a certain UFO researcher tried to tell us that NASA operated an anti-gravity chamber on a platform off of the Gulf Coast of Texas, while at the same time the MUFON Assistant Direc- tor, John Schuessler, was at Johnson Space Flight Cen- ter, and I knew someone who was in the Coast Guard on a Rescue Cutter in the Gulf. No such place exists. It was a dumb idea in the first place. Even Timothy Good, whose book this showed up in, agrees that it's baloney. Presumption of reality of documents What I am afraid is going on here is that there seems to be a presumption of the reality of these documents and a refusal to even consider the possibility of fakery. For every objection or problem 1 have raised, the pro- ponents claim that there are always exceptions. This gets ridiculous after a while. If every objection has an exception, you can prove anything about anything. In my opinion when more than one or two exceptions have to be allowed, there is already a problem. How can a document so wrong be so right even in the face of the fact that the parent document, the Eisenhower Briefing Document, itself is flawed? Remote viewing as verification? The first I ever heard of Bob Woods continuing in- terest in the verification of these documents was from his son Ryan in the context that they had taken the SOM 01-1 Manual, or some replication of it, to two different \"remote viewers\" who both declared that the document was genuine, although they differed in other aspects of the document's \"provenance.\" I had a hard time keeping from laughing at this. Although I don't claim any real expertise in remote viewing, I do know one of the real experts, and he se- riously cautions about listening to any claims of re- mote viewing, since it is being exploited so heavily in so many areas these days. When I mentioned the idea of any \"one\" remote viewer verifying a document like this (based on a photograph or retyped copy), I got a laugh from him. Is this real science-calling on witches and demons to verify something so poorly constructed as to be laughable? I know that there is a lot more to the scien- tific side of remote viewing and psychic phenomena, but that's not what I am talking about. What is being claimed here is an embarrassment to those disciplines. All in all, I am, and have been for a long time, con- vinced that the Eisenhower Briefing Document was a fake produced between 1980 and 1982 by someone with a good imagination and an extended background in the UFO business, not necessarily known to us. There are people out there who have been studying the UFO, in the closet so to speak, so it is not accept- able to say no such person exists. I have met several people who have an excellent knowledge of the UFO business without ever having had their name come forth. I am also aware of a very well versed UFO en- thusiast who has had for a long time both the ability and propensity to produce something like the SOM 01-1 Manual (or the EBD). A free commercial? Lastly, I object to the tone of the article toward the end, where it turned into a commercial for selling a CD and a book. I complain here as a MUFON Board Member to the editors: commercials are supposed to appear in the Readers' Classifieds and not in the text of a five and one-half-page infomercial. Under such circumstance the audience may mistake this as being a commercial venture and not a truth-seeking one. I suppose some people will conclude that I am an obvious \"NSA planted spy\" put into the UFO commu- nity 30 years ago to write this one article as a part of my misinformation duties. Baloney again.

Cattle mutilation case reported in San Luis Valley New Mexico Veteran researcher Christopher O'Brien (tmv@pop.amigo.net) reports that a full grown cow was found dead and mutilated in classic fashion on a ranch north of Questa, NM, at the southern end of the fabled San Luis Valley. The find occurred on May 4, 1999, probably the morning after the animal died. Mysterious livestock mutilations have been reported for decades in the valley, which runs through south- central Colorado and into northern New Mexico. Cattle ranch manager Tom Reed said his latest mu- tilated cow, a 4-year-old red angus, was found lying on its left side, missing its tongue and right ear. A large gash was present on the neck, and the animal appeared to have large bruises on its right side. The carcass was found about a mile from the ranch house. This is ap- proximately the tenth mutilation case the ranch has experienced since 1993, Reed says. Reed immediately contacted ex-New Mexico State Patrol officer Gabe Valdez, who has investigated nu- merous mutilation cases in the area and is currently working with the Robert Bigelow's National Institute of Discovery Sciences (NIDS). Then the 900-pound animal was loaded into a truck and taken to a diagnos- tic lab in Sante Fe. Albuquerque investigator Gail Staehlin also ob- tained soil and plant samples from the area around the carcass for testing by Dr. W.C. Levengood of BLT Research Group. Levengood has previously discovered anomalous soil and plant changes around several mu- tilation carcasses .-Thanks to CNI News and Chris O'Brien for this report.

He lost sight of it due to the trees. A few days later, on Feb. 20, he and his wife were sitting in their sunroom at 11:40 p.m.. They were watching a fox feed on bread they had put outside when a craft appeared heading in a southerly direction. They stepped out on the porch for a closer look. Dennis states, \"The craft passed over us silently, slowly, steadily and very low. The underside of it was dimly lighted by a hazy white light, thus making it pos- sible to see the logo. The logo was a triangle edged in yellow containing the Earth being struck by two light- ning bolts with the number' 1' in the right hand comer. \"As it approached, a feeling of serenity and calm came over us, making it a wonderful feeling to watch as it passed overhead. I estimate the speed of the craft at five to ten miles per hour. The size was approxi- mately 40 feet in length and forty feet wide at the rear of the craft, with the nose of the craft forming a point. The craft looked similar to a Stealth fighter, however, it was a much larger plane. The altitude of the craft was about one hundred feet. I repeat, there was not a sound from the craft, and it did not even create a breeze. I would appreciate any answers you might have as to what this craft is or who it belongs to.\" I have spent several hours on the phone interview- ing Dennis, who states the logo or insignia was five feet in diameter, and at the front was the Omega sym- bol. The two lightning strikes that penetrate Earth be- gin at the 11:00 and 1:00 positions. A similar light- ning symbol was used by Roman soldiers conquering ancient Britain.

Donut-shaped UFO seen in New York PAWLING — A 28-year-old woman woke up on the morning of April 26 after a weird dream at 4:45 a.m. While awake, she happened to see a light move outside through the window. She saw a round object that looked like it had a hole in the middle (donut shaped she thinks). The object looked like it was on fire (she said it looked this way because of the very bright white light). It was spinning and moved away from her in a west- erly direction. When she first saw the object, it was about the same distance away as a nearby radio tower. The object was about 2 to 3 times the width of the base of the radio tower that is a 1/2 mile away. The object would repeatedly become very bright and then dim. It hovered, and was seen for about thirty minutes. She woke her brother up to witness the object. When it left, it moved at a normal speed and flew up into the clouds. Thanks to Jim Bouck Asst.

Saturday night (5/1799) my wife Karen and I were returning home at 10:30 p.m. We live in a gated community which has a lake in the cen- ter. As we turned on to Route 600 (3 miles from the lake) we could hear a very loud helicopter and looked over in the field to the left. I then saw two helicopters in what appeared to be a chase. \"These two helicopters were low in the field, maybe 100 feet altitude maximum, and were lighted with nor- mal navigation lights. I saw starboard green lights as they approached. These two helicopters were chasing something that was not lighted. Karen screamed be- cause I swerved, trying to look up, and almost wrecked the car in the ditch, running off the side of the road. \"These two helicopters and what ever they were chasing passed directly over us heading toward the lake. We could feel the car shake as they passed over. We drove home and could hear the helicopters over the lake. \"A large heavy black helicopter flew over the street in front of our house, heading south in the clear sky. This black helicopter was at an altitude of no more than 50 feet above the tree tops with no lights of any kind! It was very loud and the ground shook. As the black helicopter passed over us, it was chased by the two well-lighted, helicopters we originally saw. \"The two smaller chase helicopters had slightly dif- ferent light configurations from each other. They ap- peared and sounded more like medical evacuation and business helicopters. All three turned and flew over the lake again. They came back and passed over head heading south and disappeared. I turned on my scan- ner, but was unable to pick up any information. \"I am a licensed commercial instrument pilot. I got a very good look at the helicopters. I was shocked they were flying so close and low in a residential area.\" Thanks to richard.lang@smtpgate.crestar.com - Note: Black Helicopters were also reported over Downers Grove, IL on March 22, at 2: p.m. at 150 feet."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1999 Page 11 Part II: Death bed confessions Roswell 1999: What's new? By Thomas J. Carey & Donald R. Schmitt In courts of law, so-called \"deathbed confessions\" are accorded special weight and consideration from other testimony because of the belief that when a per- son knows that he or she is checking out for good, that person will want, in the end, to have his or her con- science cleared and truth to be his or her lasting legacy. Perhaps the most significant \"deathbed confession\" to date in the Roswell investigation has been that of the former Provost Marshal at the Roswell Base in 1947, Maj. Edwin Easley. When first interviewed by Roswell investigator Kevin Randle, all Easley would say was that he couldn't discuss the Roswell Incident, that he was still sworn to secrecy. Over and over, Easley would repeat that same phrase to each question that Randle asked. Sometime there- after, while on his deathbed, he in fact confirmed to family members his participation in the recovery of an extraterrestrial spacecraft and crew (\"Ohhhhhh, the creatures!\"). Just before he passed away in 1994, the Roswell base adjutant in 1947, Maj. Patrick Saunders, wrote on a copy of The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell (1994) that he sent to the book's authors, Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt, this cathartic statement: \"This is the truth, and I still haven't told anyone.\" As participants in the Roswell events of 1947 ex- pire at an increasing rate, it should be expected that we encounter more confessions of the \"deathbed\" va- riety, and such is indeed the case. A woman whose husband was an MP stationed at Roswell in 1947 re- layed to us the information that her husband, on his deathbed four years ago, \"confessed\" to guarding the perimeter-but not picking up the debris-at the Foster/ Brazel ranch site, while another woman told us that her husband, during the last year of his life, in 1995, finally told her of his involvement in the events. After seeing a show on TV that featured the Roswell Incident, she at last asked him, \"Well, Dear, is it true?\" He answered, \"Well, I suppose that it's time I should tell you. I've been meaning to for a long time.\" He had been a cook with the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell in 1947 and confirmed to her that he was simply grabbed one day and told to report to Building #84 (a hangar) on the base. He was given a gun and told to stand guard at the hangar with other similarly confiscated base per- sonnel. While on guard duty, he stole a look inside the han- gar long enough to see debris scattered about and \"small bodies\" being prepared for shipment elsewhere. Asked if she believed her husband when he told her this, the woman stated without hesitation or reservation, \"Ab- solutely, he was telling the truth to me when he knew he didn't have much longer.\" In another case, the granddaughter of someone in- volved in the Roswell events (at this point, we do not know in what capacity he was involved) contacted us to say that her grandfather had just passed away and had left \"documents\" pertajning to Roswell that would prove something extraordinary had happened there in 1947. As this is being written, we have been negotiat- ing for several months to receive copies of some of these alleged documents prior to making an expensive trip for a personal interview and to review the origi- nals. Finally, as this is written, we are aware of a former officer who was stationed at Roswell in 1947 who is terminal and knows it. He has told his family that he would like to make a statement concerning Roswell, but at a time of his own choosing. We have been in touch with members of the family, who have assured us that they will let us know when it is time. Reluctant witnesses To qualify as a \"reluctant witness,\" one must be believed to possess information about the Roswell events, either by being involved directly, tangentially, or by being a relative of someone who was, or by other means, and refuse to discuss it at all (e.g., by citing a security oath, or by giving what is believed to be false and misleading statements). By far, the most famous (or infamous) of the \"re- luctant witnesses\" still out there-at least according to Roswell proponents-is the former base Counter-intel- ligence Officer, Sheridan Cavitt, who accompanied the 509th's Intelligence Officer, Jesse Marcel, to the Fos- ter/Brazel ranch to observe and retrieve material that Marcel would later describe as having an extraterres- trial origin. In 1994, Cavitt confirmed his involvement in the Roswell Incident for the first time to the Air Force's Col. Richard Weaver at the same time he was still denying his involvement to civilian Roswell investi- gators. Cavitt told Weaver that what he saw on the Fos- ter Ranch that day in 1947 were the immediately rec- ognizable remnants of a weather balloon and radar tar- get which they retrieved in short order. Cavitt's ac- count, therefore, is in conflict with those of other cred- ible eye-witnesses to the same events, as well as with his own prior statements of non-involvement.

He provided new de- tails about his father's activities after the crash. fled as a \"reluctant witness,\" but then ceased to be so described when he gave up his defense of, \"I can't talk about it,\" and finally \"came-clean.\" We currently have a number of such witnesses still out there who refuse to talk, but for whom we can only hope that they will someday relent and tell us what they know. Such a witness is a former member of the 1395th Military Police Squadron stationed at Roswell in 1947. When located living in Pennsylvania near one of the co-authors, he confirmed that, yes, he was stationed at Roswell in 1947 and, yes, he was indeed involved in recovery activities there: \"You mean that thing that crashed into the side of a hill? Yes, I was involved, but that's all I'm going to tell you.\" When asked why, he replied, \"I'm retired military, and I like things the way they are.\" End of conversation. Another fellow's name was passed along to us as a first-hand witness still living in Roswell. According to our intermediary, he drove a truck on the base in '47, and he drove right into the recovery activities at the hangar (Bldg. #84). After seeing the debris and the bodies, he was grabbed, stood spread-eagle against the wall, and threatened with his life. When questioned in person, all he will tell us today is that he does not want to talk about it. Asked if he would ever consider talking about it, he replied that he wasn't sure, but that he was sure that he wasn't ready to talk about it now. Wonderful. Still another fellow, a former MP stationed at Roswell in '47 (confirmed by the base yearbook), gave us a preliminary statement one evening after a lecture about being shown one of the recovered bodies. Later, when contacted by telephone for a follow-up interview, he denied being the person we were seeking (because of his peculiar voice inflections, we knew we had the right person). Nice. There is yet another witness, still living at the rela- tively young age of 58 years-old, whose identity is known to all Roswell investigators. He saw everything and could solve this case for everyone tomorrow. The problem is: we know who he is and where he is, but no one has interviewed him as yet. Not for lack of trying, however. He has the knack of being able to \"disappear\" every time an investigator gets near, sofar with a 100% success rate. How long can his luck con- tinue? We keep trying and hoping and are open to sug- gestions. Finally, we received an e-Mail from a gentleman who claimed that his wife is friends with a woman whom she met when both worked at Walker AFB (for- merly Roswell Army Air Field) in Roswell in 1960. According to the gentleman, his wife said that the woman told her that she had been a nurse stationed at Roswell AAF in 1947 and was there \"when the little bodies were brought in to the base hospital.\" In a follow-up phone call to the gentleman and his wife, the wife made it clear to us that her friend, who is still living, will deny everything if ever confronted with this information. As things now stand, we only know the alleged nurse's first name and the name of the town in which she resides: Frustration City. Witnesses and a new crash scenario In addition to locating new witnesses to the Roswell events of 1947 (about 20 in number and still count- ing), our investigation has made a special effort to keep in touch with \"old\" witnesses, such as Bill Brazel, Jr., Walter Haul, Glenn Dennis, Frank Kaufmann, Frank Joyce, Frankie Rowe\" and Jack Rodden, people who have already gone on record with their stories. By revisiting their testimony when we are in Roswell, we have been able to glean new bits of infor- mation from them concerning those long ago events which, when combined with the new information that we are developing from the \"new\" witnesses, is caus- ing us to reconsider some prior conclusions as to what occurred, where it occurred, and when it occurred. Without giving the store away here, a future article will suggest a new Roswell crash sequence while an- swering the nagging question as to why the military"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1999 Page 13 kept \"Mac\" Brazel in \"custody\" for so long. The smoking gun? Mention must be made here of a recent develop- ment in the case which is not a result of our own in- vestigation (although we are now participating-but more about that at another time). It concerns several photographs taken of Gen. Roger Maxwell Ramey in his Ft. Worth office on the after- noon of July 8, 1947, at his hastily-convened press conference during which he announced to the world that what was recovered on the J.B. Foster Ranch the day before by the Roswell AAF's Intelligence Officer was \"really\" a misidentified weather balloon and an aluminum-foil radar target. It has been known by Roswell investigators for years that, in all of the Ramey photographs that were taken that day, he is shown in each as kneeling on one knee beside the remains of a decaying weather balloon and a ripped-up (but an otherwise pristine, off-the-shelf) radar target strewn about the floor of his office. In each photo, Gen. Ramey is shown holding what appears to be a teletype message in his left hand as if it had just been given to him prior to the start of his press confer- ence. In all but one of the Ramey photos (did he realize his mistake?), the hand-held teletype appears to be blank, but in the one photo (the first one taken?) it is obvious that, although somewhat crumpled in his hand, the memo appears to contain writing. Under low mag- nification, it can be seen that individual sentences are distinguishable from one another on the memo, but their constituent letters or words cannot be made out. It is interesting to point out that we had already at- tempted to interpret the text of the Ramey memo in 1990 when we requested Richard Haines to computer- analyze the photograph, but back then Dr. Haines was only able to identify a few individual letters. Today, combining extreme magnification with the latest computer-enhanced analytical techniques, sev- eral teams of photographic analysts remarkably claim to have been able to \"decipher\" parts of sentences [i.e., actual words] on the exposed portion of the Ramey teletype. [See Page 15 of this issue of the Journal.] While the teams are not in total agreement at this time as to what the entire memo says, a single, glaring phrase is clear to all who have had an opportunity to view an enhanced picture of the memo, and in our opin- ion constitutes a \"smoking gun.\" There is no dispute whatsoever that the phrase \". .. victims [emphasis ours] of the wreck ... forwarded to Ft. Worth, Tex. \" can be seen on the Ramey memo and, to us, indicates that a weather balloon-Project Mogul or otherwise-was NOT what crashed and was recov- ered at Roswell in July of 1947. The memo, in our \"New witness\" Vennie Ragsdale described strange pieces of metal with \"hieroglyphic writing\" on them brought home by her husband in 1947 and kept in their trailer for years until they were stolen. opinion, appears to have originated with Gen. Ramey and probably went to either Col. William Blanchard, commander of the 509th Bomb Group based at Roswell, which was under Ramey's direct command, or to higher authorities in Washington, D.C. The apparent \"Ft. Worth connection\" is also espe- cially interesting to us now, since a new source to our investigation had been leading us in that direction be- fore news of the Ramey memo analyses surfaced. What is needed now is for at least two independent investigations with no affiliations to Roswell, Roswell witnesses, or the various Roswell investigations to conduct their own objective and impartial analyses of the Ramey photo/memo and to publicly present their findings, whatever they may be. Interestingly, the usual cast of Roswell debunking characters, including the U.S. Air Force (all of whom accept the Project Mogul balloon \"explanation\" for Roswell), has, to date, been strangely silent concern- ing the Ramey memo. Who \"in the know\" back in 1947 could have ever imagined that Roger Ramey, \"point- man\" for the Roswell coverup, might one day a half- century later have unwittingly provided us with the key to unlock the door to the ultimate secret? Oh, irony of ironies."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 June 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Brazilian ball of light baffles researchers CNI News Report The March 1,1998, edition of CNI News reported that near Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Jan. 2,1998, a young boy captured on videotape a small glowing object that was seen by numerous witnesses as it flew, apparently intelligently guided, at housetop level over the neigh- borhood. The videotape, which was shown on Brazil- ian TV news, seemed to present the best evidence yet of small, luminous, self-propelled orbs that have been reported in many parts of the world. The following report is a recent update by German researcher Michael Hesemann, as reported by CNI News. This is followed by a brief look by the editor at a recent sight- ing by Ted Phillips in Missouri. By Michael Hesemann On Jan. 2,1998, at 9:30 pm, a luminous ball was filmed doing maneuvers in a suburb of Sao Paulo, the world's second largest city. The film was shown in several coun- tries and excited even skeptical researchers, since it clearly shows the high speed football-sized object literally dive into the streets of Capao Redondo, at the southwestern edge of the city, then shoot straight up, come down again, and repeat its maneuvers several times. Altogether, the event took about 35 minutes, with 4.5 minutes captured on video. Brazilian UFO investigators have located and interviewed about 60 eyewitnesses. It was a hot Brazilian summer night. The sky was clear, with many stars visible. Fernando Mariano de Oliveira, 24, was talking to his cousin, Luciene da Cunha Lopes, 22, in the living room of their residence at Luis Augusto Ferreira Street on the side of a small hill overlooking the suburb. Suddenly their attention was caught by something bright in the sky. Looking out of the window, they saw a small sphere moving up and down in the sky, accelerat- ing and slowing down again. For some moments, it just passed calmly over the roofs of the houses. The light was white with a little bit of orange. The dogs in the neigh- borhood started to bark. It was like nothing the couple had ever seen before. They told other family members: Fernando's mother, Maria Cristina de Oliveira, 46; his brother, Alan Bruno de Oliveira, 10; Lucience's sister, Katiusca da Cunha Lopes; and another cousin, Grane Evas da Cunha. They discussed all possibilities: Could it be a remote controlled object? A kite with a light hanging from it? A balloon? They ruled out one after the other. Suddenly the phone rang. Waldir Mariano, 21, Alan's brother, was calling to tell his mother he wouldn't be home for dinner. Katiusca, who took the phone, told him about the sighting. Waldir was stunned. \"Haven't you recorded it?\" he asked. They hadn't even thought about it! Immediately Alan ran upstairs, took the video camera and went out on the balcony of one of the bedrooms. Katiusca followed him. He had problems with the autofocus, and since he didn't know how to turn it off, he handed the camera over to Katiusca, who continued to film for another 2.5 minutes. Shortly after 10 p.m. every- thing was over. When Alan's father, Waldir Mariano de Oliveira, 47, came home later, he found his family in a state of great excitement. He decided to look for reporters and special- ized people to analyze the video, because he wanted to know what it was. When they shot the video, Alan and Katiusca noticed the excitement of people in the streets. The phenomenon lasted for 30 or 35 minutes on a hot summer night, so certainly many people must have seen it. And just after Alan's father presented the video on Brazilian television, the Sao Paulo UFO researcher, engineer Claudeir Covo, started an investigation, supported by his colleague, Dr. Ricardo Varela, a scientist of the Brazilian Space Agency. Both of them were not only able to locate and inter- view nearly 60 other eyewitnesses, they also learned of two similar events which happened within a year in the same area. They all confirmed the maneuvers filmed by Alan and Katiusca, and delivered further details. They all described it as about football-sized and white mixed with red color, making no noise at all. Having heard about the incident, and after receiving a clear copy of the footage, I flew to Sao Paulo on March 13, 1999, to document the case on film. Together with Covo, whom I had known for six years, and my transla- tor and assistent, Cristina Goncalves Massant, I drove to Capao Redondo on Sunday, March 14.1 managed to in- terview 13 of the witnesses, including Alan, Katiusca and their family. The testimony which impressed me the most was that of Francisco Leao da Silva Neto, a simple worker who was at the bus stop waiting for his wife Monica to come home. When she did, they began to walk home, when Monica saw something that looked like a balloon falling from the sky. For a moment, it stopped just 10 meters above them. Monica ran home, fearing that the object might be dangerous to her health, but Francisco stayed and followed its movements. He described in great detail a green fluorescent light on top of the object. Indeed, after studying Alan's film very carefully, Covo and I were able to identify Fran- cisco Leao da Silva Neto in Alan's film. We also saw that the green fluorescence is visible in some sequences, when it moved closer to the camera. Reconstructing the flight pattern of the object, which on the film clearly passes by houses and crosses over streets below roof level, Varela and Covo were able to calculate the distance of the object in the film to be al-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1999 Page 15 ways between 50 and 200 meters from the camera. Its minimum altitude was about 10 meters or 30 feet above ground level; its highest, on the film, 120 meters. Its diameter, based on both calculations and eyewit- ness statements, was calculated to be 20-25 centimeters, or 8-10 inches. Furthermore, we eliminated several alternative expla- nations, including a luminous balloon, a kite carrying a lamp, or a remote-controlled object. We also eliminated ball lightning. Ricardo Varela discussed the ball light- ning theory with his colleague Osmar Pinto, a meteorolo- gist of the National Space Research Institute (INPE), the Brazilian Space Agency. There is not a single case in the literature of any ball lightning lasting for 30 minutes-the lifespan of ball lightning is between 25 and 100 seconds. Therefore, the Capao Redondo orb remains a unique case. A video full of reference points documents a seem- ingly intelligent flight pattern of a small anomalous ob- ject, which might be an unmanned probe, seen by about 60 eyewitnesses, one of whom is even clearly visible on the tape. Indeed, the Capao Redondo video appears to provide prime evidence for the existence of a phenom- enon which has often been encountered in UFO research. Similar objects have been filmed elsewhere in the world: over Mexico in November 1997; flying around the Concorde in January 1976; and on a remarkable video taken by Stephen Alexander on July 26, 1990, next to a crop circle in Alton Barnes, England. But this case con- firms their existence beyond all doubt, and directs our attention to the active UFO research in Brazil, a country which, since 1994, has experienced a wave of sightings and produced at least a dozen highly impressive videos. Editor's Note: Ted Phillips, who had a sighting in Missouri recently, says, \"The Brazilian objects certainly sound quite similar (football sized) to some of the Mis- souri objects described as beach ball sized. The things I saw were yellow-orange at the top and center and an odd red/violet/purple band around the base and sides, and seemed larger (12 ft wide x 18-20 ft long vertically). No sound was associated with any of the Missouri objects.\" Interestingly, when Ted saw the objects he had a video camera set up which had been left running in order to possibly catch some of the anomalous objects being re- ported. He also held a video camera. When the objects appeared, one flew over the stationary video camera set up on a tripod, then maneuvered in front of it. Ted, taken aback by the sudden, spectacular sighting and the shouts of others, managed to shoot only a few seconds of video of one object. He was confident, how- ever, that the stationary camera had recorded much of the event, since one object had flown over it, then di- rectly in front of it. However, when he checked this cam- era he found that it had been shut off and the video tape ejected-seemingly by the object. \"There was still tape left to be recorded, the battery was okay, and this had not occurred before,\" he noted. Update on Ramey letter By Donald R. Burleson, Ph. D. MUFON Research Specialist Here's another update on the Ramey letter, in particu- lar with reference to the place name near the end of line 5.1 make the two-letter word in front of the place name AT, so that the entire expression is of the form SITE TWO AT (place name), NMEX While some people have seen MAGDALENA in the place name, my imaging shows that it is clearly not MAGDALENA. For one thing, this is fixed-width type, and the character group in question only allows room for eight characters, even considering the slight convex- ity of the paper. Let me explain how the character group looks under optimal imaging conditions. The first letter is a problem, as it is unclear at best (but definitely not M). Passing over that letter for a moment, we can observe that the three letters following are -ARL- (this is very clear on the glossies made from the original negative). The next letter is not terribly clear initially, but image enhancing shows it almost certainly to be S. The letter after that is somewhat \"washed out,\" but is very faintly visible on my glossy print. After that we have an A. Finally, there is some irregular spacing, with the last letter somewhat \"blobbed\" and dropped a little be- low the line. On the glossy it's very faint but appears to be D with the right-hand curve darker than the rest. The whole configuration, except for the first letter, then appears as -ARL(S)( )A(D). The very faint letter between S and A looks somewhat like B on the glossy. The clear suggestion is that the place name appears overall to be CARLSBAD. The problem is the first let- ter, which doesn't look much like C. Under close imag- ing it actually looks a bit like V. While it isn't incon- ceivable that someone could have typed V for C (they're contiguous on the keyboard), a more likely explanation is that if one lines up, as closely as possible, the tops and bottoms of the letters, the portion that would really con- stitute the initial letter does not include the apparent \"fork\" at the top, which may well be an aberration of shadow. The bottom of the letter in question, anyway, is curved like a C. Even if we only credit as much as ()ARL(S)( )A(D) for the character group, or for that matter even if we credit only as much as ()ARL( )(A)(), I have checked T. M. Perch's New Mexico Place Names: A Geographical Dic- tionary and have verified that no other place name in New Mexico of that length even comes close to match- ing the morphology of the name. Obviously it is intriguing in the extreme to ask what exactly could have been meant by SITE TWO AT CARLSBAD. This is scarcely what I would have ex- pected to read, so I think it's fair to say that the reading is not a preconception."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 June 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Seed money needed for ballot initiative By Larry W.

In this case, we're looking first at such administrative costs as those incurred in print- ing the various state signature petitions, mailing the petitions to and from distribution points, paying cer- tain filing fees imposed by the state secretaries, and making long-distance telephone calls. As the project gains momentum, it may become necessary at the national level to set up a small, sepa- rate administrative office to monitor state coordina- tion tasks, deal daily with the inquiring news media, oversee funding allocations, and operate a toll-free tele- phone/fax number for access to and from the field. For the purpose of managing the office, MUFON Director of Public Affairs Robert H. Bletchman has volunteered his professional services (pro bono), pro- vided we can obtain an appropriate stipend from one or more moneyed benefactors. Our proven, widespread pool of highly educated and motivated members would lighten the burden of gathering the necessary signa- tures, the required quantity of which varies from state to state. The strong, active MUFON presence in Missouri, for example, might give that state a jump start in kick- ing off the petition drive. In the process, it could achieve a collateral benefit-the recruitment of new members, who in turn could swell the ranks of signature gather- ers and contributors. Our progress from state to state can be charted on the current MUFON headquarters Internet website (http://www.mufon.com), on the affected state chap- ter sites, or on a site specially designed for this effort. Any one (or all three) of these could offer feedback from the field, as well as problem-solving solutions. Of course, this expanded site activity might incur ad- ditional expense, which could be offset by a related growth in membership. In the meantime, your financial support In the early stage will signal not only a renewed commitment on your part to take an active role in holding the govern- ment to account; it also will help encourage others to join us as new MUFON members and as returned former members. From my personal experience, I know that many supporters of this or that cause prefer to contribute to project-specific fund drives. Accordingly, I suggest that when you send in your checks or money orders (pay- able to MUFON, Inc), simply go ahead and designate the amount toward \"support of the UFO Ballot Initia- tive.\" That way, MUFON headquarters more readily can allocate funds to the various state Petition Drive Committees. Let's seize-and nurture-this dual opportunity to help our fellow citizens express themselves at the ballot box and to help MUFON complement its world-renown scientific research role with a stronger leadership role in ending official UFO secrecy.

An article on the ballot initiative appeared on Page 16 of the May Journal.] Dr. Roger Leir and Derrel Sims dissolve research partnership In an announcement dated April 26, Texas-based ab- duction researcher and hypnotherapist Derrel Sims an- nounced he is dissolving a two-year partnership with Cali- fornia-based researcher and podiatrist Dr. Roger Leir. Sims and Leir gained worldwide notoriety for perform- ing a number of \"implant removal\" surgeries on men and women believed to have been abducted and implanted by aliens, as recounted in Leir's recent book, The Aliens and the Scalpel. One of these implant surgeries was shown in the NBC-TV special \"Confirmation\" in February. Sims says he asked for and received Dr. Leir's resig- nation as Medical Director of the Fund for Interactive Research in Space Technology (FIRST), the partnership they formed in 1996. \"The medical responsibilities of FIRST are going to require professionals with a broader scope and experi- ence than possessed by Leir, who is a podiatrist,\" Sims wrote in somewhat critical fashion, adding that he is se- lecting a team of medical, scientific, \"and other uniquely- disciplined professionals.\" It was not clear how this would change procedures, since Dr. Leir and Sims have been utilizing medical doctors in removal of the objects. It was also not clear how one \"partner\" could request the resignation of the other \"partner,\" but Leir says that he and Sims will continue to share data. The team is breaking up because of philosophical differences, accord- ing to Leir, who has found a welcome among ufologists that has eluded Sims. Dr. Leir, Section Director for the Ventura County, CA, chapter of MUFON, says he will continue his work with \"implants,\" and that separate implant research efforts are desirable."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"r-- l-H 0> MUFON 1999 INTERNATIONAL UFO SYMPOSIUM SPEAKING PROGRAM a I o fa D Z g SATURDAY, JULY 3  MORNING SESSION 9:00 a.m. Welcome to Arlington  Susan L.

New York: Fromm In- ternational, 1998. Hardback. 352 pp. $26. Bibliog- raphy and Index. Review and interview by Alan Vaughan, Ph. D. British author Colin Wilson's 80th book brings con- siderable insight into the complex mystery of the UFO/ alien phenomenon. With a background of librarianship, he became world famous at age 24 with the interna- tional best-seller The Outsider in 1956. He has written on the paranormal in several books, such as The Oc- cult, Psychic Detectives, and From Atlantis to the Sphinx, his 79th book. A prodigious reader as well as writer, he read 200 books in researching Alien Dawn. He has a knack for digesting differing points of view and getting down to the heart of the controversy with clear, readable in- sights. He treats the alien contact experience as pro- viding clues to a mystery to be solved. His solution is provocative-that alien contact goes beyond the physi- cal universe into other dimensional reality interfaced with psychic experience. Below are his own words in an e-mail interview: Q: You give particular attention to theories of Jacques Vallee and John Keel about the extradimensional aspect of UFOs and aliens. What attracted you to their point of view? A: It seemed very obvious to me that the way UFOs appear and disappear indicates that they-or at any rate some of them-are not subject to the ordinary limita- tions of space and time. And case after case of abduc- tion has the aliens exiting-with the abductee-through the walls or windows. Many cases showed that the aliens seem to know exactly what the abductees have been doing during their everyday lives. In short, the aliens seem capable of a kind of telepathic phone-tapping. In view of this, I found it impossible to believe that they are merely space-men using an advanced technology. I had started to study paranormal events in the late 1970s, when commissioned to write a book called The Occult, and it seemed obvious that many \"aliens\" use paranormal powers. Q: You include material on lake monsters and Bigfoot as well as other strange creature sightings. How do you think they are connected with aliens and UFOs? A: As far as I can see, the aliens seem to use crea- tures looking like Bigfoot, presumably as some sort of camouflage. It seems likely that they are some kind of servant or robot. As to lake monsters, my friend Ted Holiday pursued the Loch Ness monster for years, as well as other lake monsters in Ireland, and gradually came to feel that they aren't solid creatures, but again, something with paranormal powers. It sounds crazy, but another friend who was a monster hunter, the Rev Donald Ormand, reached the same conclusion. Ted noted that UFO sightings are often associated with places where monsters are seen, like Loch Ness-he encountered them around the loch. Q: What is your reaction to the \"nuts and bolts\" flying saucer found at Roswell in Philip Corso's ac- count in The Day After Roswell? And seeing an alien corpse? A: I began by being impressed by Philip Corso's book, and by Linda Howe's assurance that he seemed totally honest. But his story just doesn't hang together. He thinks we are about to be-or were about to be- invaded by space men, and that it is all quite solid and real. That is simply contradicted by dozens of obser- vations made by John Keel and Jacques Vallee. And when Corso describes how he was called into a darkened shed by a subordinate to be shown the corpse of a crashed alien from Roswell, my credulity boggles. Surely the Air Force wouldn't send bodies to Wash- ington by road-they'd put them on a plane. I think Corso's book is a hoax. As to Roswell, in spite of powerful evidence of a government cover up, I can't believe that the aliens are so incompetent that they crash their space ships. Q: What do you think of the hypothesis that UFOs, aliens and strange creatures are created by the psychic abilities of the observers? A: I don't think they are created by observers, any more than ghosts are. I think that at least some of them are, in fact, \"spirits\" of the kind who were summoned up by mediums in the 19th century, and who are \"wan- derers\" between two worlds-juvenile delinquents of the spirit world, like poltergeists. Q: What role do you believe psychic abilities might play in the UFO phenomenon? A: I think they play a major role, in that people with developed psychic abilities seem to find it easier to see UFOs, and even \"summon\" them. Q: What present clues to the UFO phenomenon might forecast the future of the alien presence in human affairs? A: I came to the conclusion that, whether they in- tend it or not, the role of the UFOs and their occupants is to accelerate human evolution. As I say in the book (and it is its most important assertion), I believe we are now jammed in a kind of evolutionary cul de sac, and the role of the \"aliens\" is to force us to take a wider view. Q: In researching your book by reading 200 ear-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 1999 Page 19 Her books, did you find anything Chat surprised you? A: I was amazed at the way it all came together- just as I was when I began seriously researching \"the occult\" in 1969. Anyone who looks at the whole field becomes aware of a definite pattern. Any psychical researcher can see what old ghost stories are genuine, and which are inventions, because he knows certain things from coming across hundreds of cases. The same goes with criminology, another of my interests. I was increasingly impressed by the way that everything re- garding UFOs began to fit together, like some huge jigsaw puzzle. Q: Are UFO/alien phenomena just a scientific curiosity, or do they have profound implications for the future of the human race? A: I don't know. They present the same kind of mystery today that witchcraft presented in the Middle Ages and \"spirits\" in the 19th century. I sometimes think that they are a variation of the same mystery, one of whose purposes is to keep us aware that \"there are more things in Heaven and earth.\" Q: What do you think of Carl Jung's theory of the UFO disk being a symbolic projection from the unconscious? A: Jung ended his life by accepting the physical re- ality of UFOs-that they are not just \"projections\" (i.e. illusions, like the drunk's pink mice). But his book makes it plain that he also recognizes that what we are dealing with is a \"psychic reality.\" In thai sense, his intuition is very close to my own, and I regard the pages in the book in which I discuss Jung as some of the best insights in it. That-and the final chapter on the new quantum reality-are the most important things in it. Q: What is your overall philosophy on UFOs? A: I have always felt that the world presents us with an apparently logical facade in which everything makes sense. And this is what scientists feel. So do rather stupid people. But the moment we look more closely at this apparently solid and normal reality, we find that it isn't as normal as it seems to be. Its normality is a confidence trick. For example, it is \"obvious\" that time is a one-way street, and anyone who claims to \"know\" the future or believe in Nostradamus or astrology must be gullible. Yet we then learn that thousands of people have had very precise glimpses of the future, while others have had time slips into the past. Clearly, this apparently logical and normal world is not what it seems. It is rather like those pictures we had in children's comics when I was small, with \"spot the deliberate mistake.\" Only life has far more than one deliberate mistake. I have the feeling that it is an intelligence test, a conundrum we are jbkcd to solve. And the first step is seeing it as a conundrum, not as Lloyd Pye, author of Everything You Know is Wrong, showed up at Lou Parish's Ozark UFO Conference in April with two interesting skulls, which he exhibited briefly. He stated that one of the skulls, of unusual shape and structure, is poten- tially that of a human-alien hybrid child. The other, he says, could be the child's mother. Experts thus far differ on what caused the unusual features of the smaller skull, and Pye promises DNA testing. The skulls allegedly came from an area of Mexico in which local folklore says that beings from space visit the Earth, mate with local women, then later come back for the hybrid children. something \"normal\" that presents no questions. The people who, from the beginning, accept it as what it appears to be are going to score a \"0\" when the time for the exam results comes. You and 1 will prob- ably get \"9.\" 1 have a feeling that the gods-or whoever manages this particular casino-leave around plenty of clues to tell the intelligent that this is all questionable, and that our problem is to start asking the right questions. The people who go through life feeling it all makes sense, and that there are no questions, probably have to do it all over again. In the 19th century, the Society for Psychical Re- search was started for people who feel that there are many questions to answer. Every poltergeist case, for example, seemed so say: \"No, the world is not normal and logical. Start thinking.\" And today, this is one of the functions of UFOs. Whether they have other func- tions, or their own aims, I don't know. But I am quite sure that they are intended as what Gurdjieff called alarm clocks."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 20 June 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Perspective Richard Hall On the May Issue By Richard Hall The dream is alive. The quest for the one big case that will prove the reality of UFOs continues. To me, the lead article on the videotape of the vomiting factory employee represents the triumph of ra- tionalism over science. By that I mean the school of thought all too common in the UFO community that one can find \"truth,\" or at least some strong evidence, by thorough analysis of something like a videotape regardless of the to- tal lack of provenance. Some of Tom Deuley's arguments about the MJ-12 documents in this same issue could equally well be ap- plied to this case. Not a single coeent argument is presented thar \\vould begin to establish that this whole affair was not a staged hoax (never mind computer trickery). Too difficult? Flashy effects? Sorry, magicians do it all the time. Debunkers or simple jokers are motivated to play tricks on the UFO community. It happens all the time, and the first warning sign usually is anonymous \"witnesses\" and lack of an objective documentary trail of evidence. Another caution flag is that the videotape offers something many members of the UFO community yearn for: documented proof. But there is no documentation here. Carpenter several times cites as established facts or as supporting evidence something said by the unknown, and presumably anonymous, alleged security guard. This line of argument would not stand up in any court of law or court of inquiry. It is second degree hearsay. We have no evidence whatsoever that the videotape actually was taken in a real factory, rather than completely staged. Incidentally, what was the alleged security guard doing for an hour and 50 minutes after he watched a flash of light surround an employee and all the factory lights went out? Why wasn't he immediately concerned enough to find out whether the man was lying there injured due to an apparent electrical accident, not to mention finding the cause of the blackout? The guard's story does not make sense. Until there is proof of a real factory and a real witness who can be questioned, this videotape is essentially worthless. Inter- esting, yes, if true. However, that's a big \"if.\" As for the Roswell update, unfortunately the case is so contaminated by contradictory evidence and tainted witnesses, and sometimes by investigator behavior, that it will take some form of strong physical evidence to turn things around. The search is well worthwhile, but again, there will need to be a documented trail of evidence. We need to seek out the additional witnesses who are known to ex- ist. We also need fresh talent in the investigator pool, especially objective people with no axes to grind. The 50th anniversary Roswell celebration was a total media circus. The vomiting man in the video lape could have been me as I watched the live coverage from Roswell. The elk abduction case is very intriguing, especially with multiple witnesses and an onsite investigation. I can't help but be reminded of a once popular theory that some UFOs may be \"space animals.\" This one certainly be- haved like a hungry predator, and even expanded its size- like a snake-to take in its prey! Continued interviewing of witnesses and thorough study of the entire circumstances could yield some sig- nificant information. The importance of field investiga- tions is obvious here. Speaking of which, welcome to Joan Woodward of Fairfax, VA, a long-time friend who just passed the Field Investigator's exam. She and I investigated a few cases for the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) years ago. Her skills will be a defi- nite asset to MUFON.

Around this time try finding the planet in day- light. Look for it about 40 degrees to the upper left of the Sun just before sunset. Venus sets about 10 PM and by the end of the month, before 9 PM. On the 10th and 11 th the dazzling planet and the star Regulus are only a degree apart. And on July 15 the planet, star, and crescent Moon make a spectacular grouping in the W. A telescope and even binoculars will reveal Venus' crescent phase during the latter half of the month. Mars (-0.2 mid-July) moves from Virgo to Libra and is not far from Spica in the SW. The red planet sets in the W about 12:30 AM in midmonth and before mid- night late in July. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter (-2.4), moving from Pisces to Aries, rises in the ENE about 12:30 in mid-July and can be found in the ESE by dawn. From the 7th to 1 Oth, the lunar cres- cent passes Jupiter, Saturn, and the star Aldebaran. Saturn (0.0), in Aries, rises in the ENE after Jupiter about 1 AM and accompanies the larger planet in the ESE at twilight. Partial Lunar Eclipse: On the morning of July 28, skywatchers in the west- em half of the U.S. and the Pacific will see the south- ern portion of the full moon slip into the Earth's shadow. The entire event is visible only from the West Coast, Hawaii, and Alaska. Maximum eclipse (40 %) is at 6:34 AM CDT, 5:34 MDT, 4:34 PDT, and 1:34 HST. The dark central (umbral) eclipse begins and ends 1 hr. 12 mins. before and after those times. Moon Phases: Last quarter-July 6 New moon-July 12 First quarter-July 20 Full moon-July 28 The Stars: O After dark two prominent sights for the telescope appear almost overhead on either side of the celestial meridian. To the E (left) of the meridian lies the tiny constellation Lyra the Harp, marked by the bright star Vega. Between the bottom two stars of the harp's crooked rectangle is the much-photographed Ring Nebula. Look first for a \"smudgy\" star in the eyepiece, then use higher powers to resolve the smudge into an oval \"smoke ring.\" Called a planetary nebula because of its roughly circular shape, the object actually is a spheri- cal shell of gas cast off by a faint dying star in the center. The nebula is 5,000 light years away. To the W of Lyra can be found the four-sided \"Key- stone\" of Hercules the Kneeling Giant. About a third of the way down the W side of the Keystone is a patch of light, this time visible to the naked eye. The object represents a huge sphere of hundreds of thousands of stars called a globular cluster. A 4-inch telescope is required to begin resolving some of the outlying stars. The Hercules Cluster is 21,000 light years distant. While the Summer Triangle dominates the summer sky from its lofty position in the S, and lower down Scorpius and Sagittarius roam the southern horizon, a few autumn star patterns have already appeared above the eastern horizon-the Great Square of Pegasus, Aquarius the Water Bearer, and Capricornus the Sea Goat.

Elaine Douglass, M.S., State Director for the District of Columbia, will be relocat- ing to Utah in the near future. Thomas B. Burch (Pooles- ville, MD), the Assistant State Director for Maryland, has ac- TakaoIkeda cepted the additional responsibility of State Director for D.C. New York State Director, Dana M. Schmidt, J.D., has appointed two new State Section Directors: Mr. Robin Vargas (New York City, Manhattan) and Mrs. Marian Del Vecchio-Ross, M. A. (Galway). Steve U. Pernicka (Starksboro, VT), Roger L. Hinojosa (Kenedy, TX) and Karl T. Pflock (Placitas, NM) were selected as new State Section Directors in their appropriate states. Field Investigator Exam results Kathleen F. Marden, Director of Field Investiga- tor Training, has announced that the following mem- bers have passed the field investigator's exam: Theresa G. Amuso (Phoenix, AZ); Mark Surma (Cranston, RI); and Sandor Toth, M, S. (Aubumdale, FL). Start- ing April 1, 1999, each person passing the exam re- ceives not only the new ID card as a Field Investigator (FI), but also an attractive blue and white MUON la- pel pin as a thank you for upgrading their investigative techniques. UFO Ballot Initiative In this issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, Larry W. Bryant, Director of Governmental Affairs, has sub- mitted an update on the UFO Ballot Initiative project. This will be one of the means of keeping everyone aware of the progress and to seek appropriate help. In the May issue, a news release was published announc- ing that a majority of the MUFON Board of Directors had approved the project.. Your Director wrote individual letters to the State Directors for the sixteen states that recognize the bal- lot initiative, advising them of the project. To date, only Glen Harper (Alaska) has acknowledged receipt. Michael G. Curta (Colorado) had previously ex- pressed his concerns, as did Northern California. The first contribution of $ 100 has been received and deposited into a special MUFON account at the Frost National Bank in San Antonio to support the project. Most people in ufology have been critical of the U.S. Air Force and our federal government for trying to cover up the existence of UFOs for more than fifty years. Now we have the opportunity to express the will of the citizens in the designated sixteen states to place the issue on their state ballots to proclaim the year 2000 \"The Year of UFO Awareness\" and to pressure Con- gress to have open hearings to end government secrecy regarding UFOs.

Make your reservations directly with the hotel at 1-800-233-1234 or (703) 418-1234. To register for the symposium, please mail a check or money order payable to: MUFON '99 International UFO Symposium and mail to 7873 Heritage Dr., Suite 574, Annandale, VA 22003. Admission to all presen- tations is $65 before June 9 ($75 thereafter). Advance registration for the buffet/party on Friday evening 6-9 p.m. is $20 (or $25 at the door). An advance registra- tion form is enclosed in the May issue of the Journal for your convenience. The vendor room has space for approximately 50 tables. Tables will be reserved on a first come, first served basis. A limit of five tables per vendor will be in effect until June 1, at which time if there are any unclaimed tables, we will lift that restriction.

Most of you attending the MUFON Symposium will be flying into Reagan National Airport, which is a scant half-mile from the Hyatt hotel. The hotel has a cour- tesy van to take you door-to-door for your convenience. Sometimes it is more practical or cost-effective to fly into Dulles Airport to the west, or Baltimore- Washington International (BWI) Airport to the north. If that is your situation, there is a wide range of alter- natives on the last leg of your journey. There are local trains as well as organized shuttle vans that go between the airports. Sometimes a flight into BWI and a taxi ride into Arlington is less expensive and more conve- nient than flying directly to Reagan National.

With all the fascinating archives, museums and monuments to see, there is clearly some- thing for the entire family to enjoy.
