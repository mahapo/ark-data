Marler Illinois State Director During my ten years of investigating UFOs, I have never had a case like the one that occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 5, 2000. The UFO inci- dent involved multiple wit- nesses, which mainly con- sisted of police officers from a number of small Illinois towns. The officers were able to track the unknown object and maintain radio contact with each other during the event. Adding to this, Scott Air Force Base was only two miles away from the flight path of the UFO. This episode became the focus of intense media cover- age, which continued weeks after the actual event. The first person to notice anything unusual that early morning was Melvern Noll. Noll is the owner of a miniature golf course located in Highland, IL, which is approximately 24 miles from St. Louis, MO. During the off-season he is a truck driver making de- liveries at all hours of the day and night. Noll was returning from a delivery run he had just completed at approximately 4 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 5. Before returning home, he thought he would check his miniature golf course and make sure ev- erything was in order. He parked his truck in the back of the building and began to exit the vehicle. While doing so, he noticed a \"bright star\" over in the north- east sky. He didn't give it much thought at the time and proceeded to enter the building, After checking things inside, he was returning to his truck when he again noticed the \"bright star\" in the northeast sky. This time he stopped and observed it more closely. He noticed the light was, in fact, moving in his general direction. In just a few minutes, Noll noticed the bright white light was only part of a larger object. It appeared to be rectangular in shape and was com- parable to the size of a football field. Noll added that the object was also very tall. This object had a series of \"windows\" that ran down the side. He also noticed two \"floors,\" each having two \"windows.\" These were described as rec- tangular with an intense white light radiating out from them. The \"windows\" appeared to be located more toward the rear of the object. When the object was side (rear) (front) bottom rear Figure 1: UFO as described by Melvern Noll. very close, Noll stated he could see a large number of dim red lights on the bottom. He assumed the exterior color must have been black or dark gray (Figure 1). The description he used to initially describe the ob- ject was \"like a-two-story house\" in the sky. During this time, Noll did not notice any sound, odor, or emission coming from the object. As it moved away to the south- west he noticed \"windows\" on the back of the object. He added that these appeared to have a series of lines or bars in them that ran up and down. The object appeared to move in a northeast to south- west direction. The speed was determined to be slow when compared to conventional aircraft. Noll said he recalls the object slowing down as it passed close to him before regaining speed as it moved away. Noll esti- mated the object was possibly a half-mile distant when it moved closest to his location. The altitude was esti- mated to be approximately 500 feet, and the duration of this sighting was estimated to be around 5 minutes. Noll promptly drove his pickup truck to the High- land Police Station. He thought that nobody would be- lieve him unless the Highland Police could contact a neighboring town's police officer who could verify that there was something strange in the sky. The dispatcher at the Highland Police Department listened to Noll's account and determined that he was a rational individual, despite his unusual claim. She then"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 March 2000 MUFON UFO Journal contacted the Lebanon Police Department. Officer Ed Barton responded to the call around 4:10-4:15 a.m. Officer Barton was initially skeptical upon hear- ing the transmission. He asked the dispatchers if they were joking. They stated they were not joking. He then proceeded to the north end of town, past Homer Park, on Widicus Road. He did not see anything in the sky at this time. He then followed Widicus Road as it turns from the north to the east, heading towards Illinois Route 4. About halfway to Route 4, Officer Barton observed two large brilliant white lights in the northeastern sky. The lights appeared so close together that he thought they were almost touching each other. He stated the lights were so brilliant in intensity that the light rays radiated outward like the symbol of the Japanese Ris- ing Sun battle flag from World War II. He became curious and decided to drive a little faster. Upon arriving at Illinois Route 4, Officer Barton turned south, heading back towards Lebanon. He was able to observe the lights to his left through his driver's side window as he was proceeding into town. At some point, as he was alternately watching the lights and the road in front of him, the two bright lights now appeared to be one bright light. At this point, he switched on his overhead lights, now believing this could possibly be an aircraft having problems. Upon arriving in town, he made a left turn onto East Route 50 and proceeded east to a bridge at the bottom of the hill. At this point, while he was still driving, he noticed the one bright light appeared as an elongated cigar-shaped object. The object seemed ,to be stationary in the sky over the northeast end of the neighboring town of Summerfield. Officer Barton stopped his vehicle on the side of the road, because he now noticed the object appeared to be heading in his direction. He stated it was not moving very fast, but not very slow either. Upon stop- ping the vehicle, he turned off all the lights and his squad car's radio in an attempt to hear any noise pos- sibly coming from the object. No noise was evident. As it approached, he noticed the distinct shape of the object. It appeared as a massive, elongated, nar- row triangle, larger in length than width. The appar- ent size of the object was conservatively estimated to be approximately 75 ft in length and 40 ft in width. At each corner, Officer Barton observed a massive bright, white light. These lights did not waver in intensity and appeared to be pointing straight down. He stated they did not light up the ground, but were very bright. In addition, there was one smaller flashing red light situated closer to the two rear white lights, yet in the midline of the object (Figure 2). He noticed that the object was blot- Figure 2: UFO as described by Officer Barton. ting out the stars above it as it passed by him. He still could not discern any noise emanating from the object. At this time, the object appeared to be closest to Of- ficer Barton, and he estimated it was no more than 100 feet distant and approximately 1000 feet above the ground. Then he observed the object rotating in the sky from a southerly heading to that of a southwesterly di- rection. As it rotated, the object did not bank as is ex- pected of conventional aircraft. Rather, the object piv- oted in mid-air without tilting to one side \"or the other and remained completely level. At this point, Officer Barton radioed Central Com- mand to tell them what he was observing, as well as its current location. In between transmissions, he stopped for a moment as the craft dramatically increased speed. The object was moving at a relatively slow pace at the beginning of his transmission, but accelerated so fast he could barely track the movement with his eyes. He was able to observe the rear of the object before this display of velocity, and his best analogy is in com- paring it to the Millenium Falcon spacecraft from the motion picture \"Star Wars.\" It appeared to be rectangu- lar and illuminated by white light. Through the middle of the light, running lengthwise, was a band of multi-colored illumination. He stated that there were no individual colored lights visible. Rather, it appeared as a band of various colors, which blended into each other. He continued the transmission by informing Cen- tral Command that the object should now be around the town of Shiloh, approximately 8 miles to the Southwest. Officer David Martin of the Shiloh Police Depart- ment radioed that he could now see something in the sky. Shortly thereafter, Officer Barton could no longer see the object from his location. Officer Martin was driving on the southern end of Shiloh heading east when he observed the mysterious object, which appeared to be heading in a westerly di- rection. He was able to observe three brilliant white"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 2000 PageS lights, which were shining downward from the object. However, the light did not illuminate the ground or objects on the ground. In addition, small red and green lights were observed on the back end of the object. At this time, Officer Martin thought the object's altitude was approximately 1,000 feet. He estimated the dis- tance from his car to the object to be about a quarter of a mile. He thought the object resembled the shape of an extra wide triangle or arrowhead. He estimated the apparent size to be 75-100 yards wide (Figure 3). Officer Martin was driving slowly during his obser- vations. He also rolled down his driver's side window to determine if the object was emitting any sound. No sound could be heard. He finally decided to pull over to the side of the road and exit the vehicle for a better observation. At this point, the object increased in speed and disappeared in a westerly direction. Officer Martin estimated the object's initial speed to be 15 mph. When it increased in speed, he figured it to be at least 80-100 mph. In the nearby town of Millstadt, IL, Officer Craig Stevens was on patrol and heard the radio traffic re- garding the object. His curiosity was aroused, so he drove to the east end of Millstadt to see this mysteri- ous thing in the sky. After not seeing anything, he pro- ceeded to Liederkranz Park on the north end of town. While sitting in his car, he observed a very large object that was roughly triangular in shape. Officer Stevens estimated the object to be only 500-1000 feet in altitude. The flight speed was described as extremely slow. He also stated that there was no noise with the exception of a \"low decibel buzzing sound\" that he could barely discern. As he watched the object, it be- gan moving to the north. It had a white light on the left side, right side, and center of the back end. In addition there was a single red light on the bottom. The back end also appeared to be slightly recessed (Figure 4). At 4:29 a.m. Officer Stevens contacted his dispatcher to advise him that he could now see the object. Then he exited his vehicle and grabbed the Polaroid camera from his squad car's trunk. He aimed the camera at the object and took a picture, but the extreme cold tem- peratures of that morning (15-20 degrees Fahrenheit) caused the camera to work poorly. He was able to pro- duce one photo, though poor in quality, before the ob- ject disappeared to the northwest (Figure 5). The last police officer to report seeing the object that morning was from Dupo, IL. I interviewed him personally, but I do not have permission to use his name. This officer also heard the radio traffic that evening and decided to take a look for himself. Approximately five minutes after Officer Stevens' radio transmission from Millstadt, the Dupo officer observed an array of lights. Contrary to the other of- ficers, this individual stated the object was at a rela- Figure 3: UFO as described by Officer Martin. bottom rear Figure 4: UFO as described Officer Stevens. UFO."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 March 2000 MUFON UFO Journal tively high altitude and proceeding in a north- northeasterly heading. It was so high in the sky that the officer said he wouldn't have noticed it if it wasn't for the radio traffic. He said it stayed east of Dupo. The altitude was described as being higher than that of a small plane, but lower than that of a commercial aircraft. The officer viewed the object through bin- oculars, but was able to see only a conglomeration of lights: white lights at the extreme ends and red lights in the middle. He could not discern any size or shape, due to the distance and altitude. These witnesses provide us with enough data to project the flight path of the object as it traveled over the Southwestern Illinois area (Figure 6). It apparently came from the northeast and traveled slowly over High- land to Summerfield. Once there, it turned to the south- west and drastically accelerated. It traveled approxi- mately 1-2 miles north of Scott Air Force Base and slowed as it passed over Shiloh. Then it increased in speed again until it arrived near Figure 5: Polaroid photo by Officer Stevens. Smittiton Flpravile (s Pade/bom s\" . ...v r - ' %AJ«k*«k-tW^ '.' Figure 6: Flight path of object through Southwestern Illinois near Scott AFB."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 2000 Page? the town of Millstadt. After slowing, it altered direc- tion again and turned to the northwest. Shortly after that, the object then made a drastic turn to the north- east while also increasing in altitude, maintaining a low altitude until this final maneuver. Due to the location of Scott Air Force Base in rela- tion to the UFO sightings, I found it necessary to con- tact them. Although I was not optimistic, I felt I should pursue every possible source of information. I wrote a letter of introduction, requesting answers to four im- portant questions concerning the recent UFO sighting. I promptly received a courteous, albeit uninforma- tive, letter of response indicating that (1) the only calls received at the base were from the media, (2) no ground observers at the base have come forward with reports, (3) the base did not track any objects on radar, since radar services are provided by the FAA at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, and (4) the base was not operating any craft resembling the reports . However, better information was provided by the St. Clair County Sheriffs Office. They released cop- ies of the dispatch tapes for the morning of Jan. 5,2000. What follows are the relevant transmissions: Dispatcher. Lebanon, this is a call from Highland P.D. in reference to a truck driver who just stopped in. He said there was a flying object in the area of Leba- non. It looks like a two-story house. It had white lights and red blinking lights, and it was last seen southwest over Lebanon. Could you check the area? Lebanon officer. Did they say the truck driver was DUI or anything? 10-4, I'm out.... Just a quick ques- tion. If I happened to find it, what am I supposed to do with it? If I see it, I'm not saying a word.... Also be advised the last thing that went over Leba- non-this was approximately five minutes ago-was a military cargo plane. It looked like a C-5. .. .Be advised there is a very bright white light east of town. It looks like it's just east of Summerfield, and it keeps changing colors. I'll go over there and see if it looks like an aircraft. It doesn't look like an aircraft, though.... It's not the moon, and it's not a star. If you would, will you contact Scott Air Force Base and see if they have anything flying in this area please? Whether it's a plane or not, it's heading westbound now. It should be really close to Scott now.... As a matter of fact, if the Shiloh officer looks up, they can probably see it by now. Shiloh officer: I see something, but I don't know what the heck it is.... It's probably heading to Lambert (Field). Millstadt officer: I've got that object in sight also Dispatcher: Are you serious? Millstadt officer: It's huge. Dispatcher: Does it look like a-What does it look like to you?\" Millstadt officer: It's kind of V-shaped. It looks like it's possibly headed toward Lambert. Dispatcher: 10-4. That's what Shiioh said when it was heading towards Fairview Heights. (One of the officers hums theme song to \"Twilight Zone\" over his radio.) Millstadt officer: Really. Does Dupo have a Polaroid? Dispatcher: That, I don't know. Dupo officer: I'm not sure what you're seeing. It appears to be pretty high in the area. When I could first see it with binoculars, you could see it was differ- ent colors. Now it appears to be white. Millstadt officer. Is it very large? Dupo officer: It's hard to tell. It's pretty far off. Millstadt officer: This object^was above me about 500 feet. And it was huge. Dupo officer: This thing appears ... it's probably 20 or 30,000. It's about where planes usually are. It's not low at all. I would now like to discuss some particular aspects of this case. The first concerns the obvious differences in the descriptions given by the witnesses. In examin- ing the figures, we can see there are major disparities between them, the largest difference being the descrip- tion provided by Noll as compared to those of the po- lice officers. Noll describes a large rectangular-shaped object. Less than fifteen minutes later Officer Barton reports seeing an elongated triangle. The other offic- ers report seeing objects that are roughly triangular. Beyond differences in shape, we also have radical differences in the lighting configurations that were re- ported. I believe there are several possibilities for the inconsistencies. The first involves the most prosaic explanation. Namely, witnesses can be wrong in their interpretations of what they claim to have seen. This is a fact all objective UFO researchers must never for- get. Is it possible the witnesses made errors in their observations? Of course that is a distinct possibility. One of the major problems relating to this is the issue of perspective. From what perspective did the witnesses view the object? Some witnesses were sta- tionary, while others were driving at the time of their sighting. In particular, Officer Barton's descriptions vary as he views the object from different distances and angles. To compound matters, the object was mov- ing at various speeds and directions in relation to the observers. Another explanation for the varied descriptions could be attributed to the notion that there were mul- tiple objects of differing shapes in the sky that night. This would explain why different descriptions were"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS March 2000 MUFON UFO Journal received. I tend to refute this idea due to a couple of facts. The terrain around Highland, Sumrnerfield, and Shiloh is extremely flat. On a clear night, like on Jan. 5, you can see for miles in all directions. This is espe- cially true between Highland and Summerfield. If mul- tiple objects were in the sky illuminated by an array of lights, observers would have seen any that were there. Also, the timing of the sightings would tend to coin- cide with the flight of a single object moving from town to town. There were only a few minutes between each sighting, which tends to suggest it was the same object being witnessed from various locations. Yet a third possible explanation could involve the object actually changing shape in flight. This is one of the more questionable ideas proposed, but a review of the UFO literature will reveal a multitude of cases which involve objects that appear to change form. I only con- sider it as a possibility. Another issue that needs to be discussed is Scott Air Force Base. I find it hard to imagine that a large un- known object with bright lights could fly under 1000 feet within two miles of the base without causing some concerns. I believe they may have more detailed infor- mation concerning this event. It is a distinct possibility that the object witnessed was a military craft of some type. Unfortunately, we do not have any evidence to support or refute this idea. In closing, I would like to extend my thanks to Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center for his invaluable assistance in this case. Also, my thanks to the witnesses who were willing to come forward and share their experiences with us. Thanks, also to Forest Crawford who directly assisted me.

Ted Phillips updates physical trace catalog Ted Phillips reports that his updated catalog of physi- cal traces associated with UFO sightings provides data from 2,240 events from 79 countries. \"This is a re- vised and updated list of traces after taking out all events where no UFO was seen at the site, crop circles, and cases with little information to study,\" he notes. There has been a considerable drop in the close en- counter/trace events since the 70's. Preliminary statis- tics indicate an average of 106 such events per year between 1967 and 1979. The average per year drops to 15.7 between 1980 and 1999. Between 1990 and 1999 the yearly average is slightly higher at 17 events per year. Multiple witness events average 34.4% of the total events, and last year 31% of the events in- volved multiple witnesses. Progress being made in deciphering Ramey letter By Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. No problem in recent UFO studies can have been as intriguing, or indeed as promising, as the prospect of reading the now-famous Ramey Letter. I have pro- duced and studied several hundred computer-enhanced images of the letter, and in attack- ing this problem I have at least two advantages going for me: I am the director of a computer lab with access to plenty of hardware and image-processing software, and I have a background in cryptanalysis, which means that I'm quite accustomed to reading things that I am not supposed to read. I have not worked on the Don Burleson Ramey problem alone by any means. Many others have tried, though frankly I must say that much of what I've seen in the press and on the Internet has been amateurish. Decipherment of the Ramey Letter is a computer process, necessarily, and while it helps from time to time to peer at a big glossy print of the letter with a magnifying glass, it can't be done by that means alone, which apparently some people have tried to do. There is, however, some good work being done. Stanton Friedman has produced a CD with Ramey Letter image files. Don Schmitt and Tom Carey have worked on the Ramey Letter and have produced re- sults that agree with my own on many important points, although inevitably there are some differences in a process as difficult at this. For everyone involved, of course, this is an ongoing research project. At this writing (December 1999), 1 have been working on the Ramey Letter for a little over a year, using a 2400-dpi scanned image cropped down to just the teletype memo, and often cropped down to single words. While I have used several different software pack- ages that have allowed me to do a variety of useful things, by far the most impressive package has been LUCIS, an extremely sophisticated program often used in such fields as electron microscopy for state-of-the-art image enhancement. LUCIS has clari- fied many points that other programs have left unclear, employing a unique but easy-to-use \"double cursor\" technique by which one may progressively manipu- late a detail-enhancing function in concert with an image-smoothing function in an essentially unlimited number of different combinations and interactions, producing a sequence of numbered enhancement lev-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 2000 Page 9 Figure 1: Extreme enlargement of Gen. Ramey holding letter. els from which one may choose results with maximal clarity. According to their Web site (www.imagecontent.com) the patented algorithm on which LUCIS is based (called Differential Hysteresis Processing) \"compares intensity differences between pixels along hundreds of radial lines\" to increase in- tensity differenfiation in certain ranges and decrease it in others to maximize clarity and detail. Fortunately, for this kind of project, one is free to make use of many software effects that would be ill advised for enhancing, say, a picture of a UFO. For enhancement of the Ramey Letter I feel free to em- ploy \"stretching\"-}.e., resizing in one direction while not resizing in another-as well as watercoloring, texturizing, embossing, and \"edgefinding\" to clarify the limits of graphemes (letter-images). Happily, most image-processing software also al- lows one to undo things done to an image, so that one may proceed backward and forward, searching for the clearest enhancements and abandoning approaches that prove unpromising. LUCIS is particularly strong in this regard. Unfortunately, however, even with the best process- ing and laser printing, something is always lost in tran- sit; I find that the clearest looks at the Ramey Letter are the ones that I see \"live\" on the computer screen. The images reproduced here are LUCIS images-of files, in some cases, that other programs had looked at before I had access to LUCIS-and these are truly re- markable when viewed \"over the shoulder\" on the com- puter screen. A cropped closeup of the letter is shown in Figure 1. Contrary to the Air Force's Weaver Report of 1994, One of the famous photos showing Brig. Gen.

In the six-character group the M has the second letter crowded against it, making an irregular space after the second letter. The longer word following is problematical due to its lying far away from the \"flashzone, \" in shadow, and apparently having irregular spacing of letters.

A careful study of Pearce 's excellent reference work, New Mexico Place Names: A Geographical Dic- tionary, reveals that, except for Carlsbad, no placename anywhere in New Mexico comes close to matching the morphology -ARLS-A- clearly visible in enhanced images. Here as elsewhere, I have been aided by the fact that fixed-width type generally makes it pos- sible to tell at least how many letters are in a word, though there is sometimes a problem with the slight convexity of the paper.

In the best imaging I have, including some images where the crease has been partially flattened out by the software, the group does look most like NEWS- PAPER, but this part of the text is difficult.] Line 7: ONLY SHOW —- -— BY WEATHER BAL- LOONS 400-KW WAVE [Commentary on Line 7: Readings differ somewhat. At first I had read the first wholly visible word as NEXT, as the third letter has a perverse way of re- sembling X, but better imaging with LUCIS clearly shows it to be ONLY. The reading SHOW for the next word is very tentative. My reading of the rather enig- matic group following BALLOONS is based on im- ages that show a hyphen after the third character, though what follows the hyphen is somewhat unclear.] Line 8: 9 AND LAND L— DENVER CREWS. [Commentary on Line 8: Readings vary, but in the best LUCIS images I have, the next-to-last grouping looks most like DENVER. It may be significant that Lowry Army Air Field at the time, in Denver, was the mortuary center for the Army A ir Force, and a natural place to send bodies.] Line 9: TEMPLE [Commentaty on Line 9: If the signature line does indeed say TEMPLE, as it appears to, no one seems to have much of an idea who that might be. It could be a code name, or even a security classification caveat, rather than a signature. All in all, the Ramey Letter is largely decipherable. Some people have remarked that perhaps the memo is unrelated to what was going on in the room in Fort Worth when the photo was taken, but this is obviously not the case. At the very least we know that the letter refers to Roswell, to recovery of a disk, to crash vic- tims being transported for viewing by a team, to some- thing being \"urgent,\" to the existence of a second \"site,\" and to a weather balloon cover story. This is clearly a very different tale from the one that General Ramey was telling the press! The thing that really makes this mostly readable let- ter significant is that it doesn't come to us out of no- where. It resides in a very rich context. We know pre- cisely when and where the photo was taken, and by whom and at whose request. We know who was hold- ing the letter, and what the press conference was about. All of this contextual \"fix\" does a great deal to clarify the references in the text of the letter itself. One curious point: why the quotation marks, in line 4, around DISK? I have discussed this at length with Don Schmitt. A good inference is that since witnesses tell us that the crashed Roswell object was not \"flying saucer\"-shaped, but rather heel-shaped, the quotes around DISK in the memo may be tantamount to say- ing, \"disk, as the press has been calling these things, even though that's not exactly the nature of what we retrieved.\" With regard to the placename that I have read in"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 March 2000 MUFON UFO Journal line 5 as Carlsbad, I should mention that this reading can scarcely be attributed to any preconceived notions or wishful thinking, because Carlsbad really makes no particular sense. No one expected or wanted it to say Carlsbad, and we don't know why it does say that. No one has ever suggested, until now, that Carlsbad had anything to do with the Roswell incident. Interestingly enough, though, a search of the mid-July 1947 newspaper files for Carlsbad, NM, has shown that there was an unusual amount of military activity there shortly after the Roswell matter. The Carlsbad Daily Current-Argus for Wednesday, July 16, 1947, says: \"More than 78 persons are expected to arrive here next week on the aerial tour of New Mexico, Maj. Charles L. Phillips, Jr., AAF, assigned to the Civil Air Patrol, said today. Local chamber of commerce offi- cials indicated that they were arranging facilities in the Crawford Hotel to feed the group that is en route from Albuquerque. The group is expected to arrive here Tuesday afternoon [July 22] and make a tour of the Caverns Wednesday. Prior to the arrival of this group, more than 50 California fliers will land here for an early morning tour of the Caverns after which they will depart. The New Mexico group is composed of Civil Air Patrol members, but no information was avail- able concerning the California group.\" The Carlsbad-based Eddy County News for Friday, July 25, 1947, says: \"A civil air patrol group made up of 71 people from Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas arrived in Carlsbad Tuesday [July 22] on a tour of the state, ac- cording to Victor Minter, Chamber of Commerce sec- retary. The CAP group was joined by 28 people who arrived in a C-54 transport Tuesday afternoon and 23 more who came in army planes. This group all came from California. Wednesday morning 60 more Cali- fornians arrived by air to join the airmen already here. A dance was given for the group at the La Conga night club by the Junior Chamber of Commerce and a din- ner was given at the Crawford hotel for part of the group that arrived earlier. The air travelers were taken to the Carlsbad Caverns in coaches and returned to Carlsbad after the Cavern tour. They departed for El Paso shortly after returning.\" Now, maybe all of this means something and maybe not, but I submit that in some ways it scarcely sounds like a typical military \"R and R\" outing. The Califor- nia group, especially, sounds suggestively mysterious, since there should have been more information avail- able to the press on them if they were simply part of an \"R and R\" group. The whole matter will certainly re- quire further research. The Ramey letter, by my read- ing, does say \"site two at Carlsbad, NMex.\" What \"site two\" means is anybody's guess-a meet- ing site? A diversionary site? (I've seen military maps with diversionary crash sites around Roswell marked on them.) A debris collection site? Even, as unlikely as it seems, another crash site? At this point we can only wonder. But we can do more than wonder about the Ramey Letter itself, because for the most part, it's readable. And I think its decipherment brings the grand UFO coverup a little closer to being over. Delaware woman says object blotted out night sky By Carl Feindt MUFON Assistant State Director, Delaware Mrs. Hendrickson (pseudonym) stated that on Sept. 11, 1999, at 4:30 a.m. she had gone out on the patio for a leisurely cup of morning coffee. After she had sat down, she leaned her head back to look at the sky. Quickly she noticed a totally black area in an other- wise starry sky. She was puzzled by this lack of stars and continued to observe it. As her eyes became more accustomed to the sky she noticed a small group of lights near the bottom of the black mass. After observing it briefly she also noticed move- ment. Initially she equated it as \"like mapping or something...off to one side, then another, like it was making boxes.\" She also noted that the lights in or on the object seemed to change pace with the movements that it made. The shape was described as a circular black void. In size it was about that of a small plate held at arm's length. During the entire time of the sighting she saw and heard commercial aircraft, but there were none in the vicinity of the object, and no sound was heard from the object. After viewing the object for about thirty minutes she went inside to get her video camera and her husband. The sighting then continued for an addi- tional seventy minutes before the object rose vertically and was out of sight. With some variations, the hus- band confirmed what Mrs. Hendrickson reported. In the course of the investigation the New Moon was ruled out, as it had not risen until 9 a.m. Surface winds and winds aloft information was obtained from NOAA and showed that if it were a balloon it could only be at 90,000 feet, which calculations with basic trigonometry indicated it would have had to be 10.5 miles wide. A check of local airports ruled out blimps, weather balloons, and conventional aircraft."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 2000 Page 13 UFOs over Washington, D.C., in 1952 Did the Air Force plan to sit out the big dance? By Robert A. Lieser, M.S. The bizarre behavior of the Air Force at the time of the July, 1952, Washington UFO episode encourages speculation that a secret policy was in effect to deal with an anticipated incursion. This was manifested in base closings and a dilatory response to calls for jet interceptors, steps taken apparently to minimize the chance of an incident that would have generated pub- lic alarm. If the ET mission had been one of search and de- stroy, government buildings could not have been de- fended; however, the larger dimension of the policy was revealed when the President was left at risk. \"The attitude of the Air Force during the July inci- dents was puzzling. When the first appearance of the blips was reported in Washington newspapers, no men- tion was made of jet interceptors. In fact the Air Force stated that it had sent none up. But when confronted with the facts by Time-Life Washington correspondent Clay Blair Jr. ... the Air Force finally admitted that it had indeed sent fighters up. No reason has been given for this contradiction. The Air Force might have been embarrassed by the delay in supplying planes, or it might possibly have known more about the blips than it had admitted.\"-Z,z/eMzgaz/>ie l Report confirmed Confirming the Life report, Donald Keyhoe stated: \"For several days officers denied that Andrews Field radar men had tracked the machines ... Another of- ficer, to prove the incident was unimportant, said that no fighters had been sent to the area.\" 2 (emphasis added). The continuing fascination of these bizarre events has resulted in more than half a dozen excellent treatments by reliable reporters. The most recent was presented by Rob Swiatek as part of the MUFON 1999 International Symposium, and takes a back seat to none. 3 With documented data, Swiatek makes it-abundantly clear that a genuine anomaly, and not the easily distinguishable weather variables, was responsible for the solid radar blips that appeared simultaneously on the ARTC (Air Route Traf- fic Control) and Washington tower scopes. These at times coincided in time and location with visual ob- servations, and literally transfixed the ARTC person- nel. Questions, some unanswered, including those raised by Life, -and some unasked, intrude themselves after the verifiable events have been absorbed. Of necessity I'll address these speculatively, hoping that the specu- lation will not be condemned as egregious. Swiatek sets the scene on the late evening of July 19 and the morning of July 20: \"... at 11:40 p.m. EDT ... control- ler Ed Nugent detected eight targets or 'blips' on his long range radar scope in the Air Route Traffic Con- trol Center (ARTCC) located at Washington National Airport. ... On top of their strange flight characteris- tics, the targets exhibited wanton disregard for the pro- hibited flight corridors scattered about the capital area: radar showed objects violated air space above the Capi- tol and the White House ... Finally, almost three hours after being summoned by the ARTCC at National Air- port and well into the most prolonged and upsetting UFO episode the Air Force had yet endured, two F-94 jet interceptors arrived from their Delaware base. 4 (em- phasis added) A second weekend Jerome Clark addresses corresponding events on the following weekend: \"On the evening of July 26, at 8:15, the pilot and stewardess of a National Airlines plane observed several objects-which they thought bore a resemblance to the 'glow of a cigarette'-high above them and moving at about 100 mph. Soon both Wash- ington National and Andrews were tracking a dozen unidentified targets in all parts of the sky except the southwest. They were traveling between 90 and 100 mph. Andrews alerted Newcastle just after 9.... by 9:30 both ARTC and Andrews were tracking more targets than they could handle ... at 11 two F-94s were scrambled from Newcastle.\" 5 (emphasis added) At the Air Force press conference held after the sec- ond weekend of UFO overflights of the capital, a re- porter queried Maj. Gen. Ramey, Director of Air Force Operations, about the delay on Saturday, July 26. Re- porter: \"General, is it true that there was a two-hour delay between the sighting of these objects last Satur- day night and the dispatch of the jets from New Castle?\" '\" Maj. Gen. Ramey: \"Yes, that is true because there was never a track established. As soon as a track was established to tell the airplane the direction to go in and the authenticity of the thing was established, then the pilots got off. As long as there's a sporadic report with no identification, no track established, there's no use in sending a very short-range short-field-duration interceptor in the air because he wouldn't know where to go or what to do.\" 6 (emphasis added). Ramey made a poor case for not checking out the Washington National reports immediately. His apo- logia was tantamount to saying: \"Where we were in Delaware we couldn't see the UFOs; and we couldn't see their track, so we didn't react.\" What their expert"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 March 2000 MUFON UFO Journal civilian counterparts at Washington National were observing seemed to carry no weight. Reporters ne- glected to seize upon the opening left by Ramey's ref- erence to short-range, short-duration aircraft to ask why the jets at Boiling AFB and Andrews AFB, adjacent to the capitol grounds, were not brought into play. Immediately after Ramey's response Maj. Gen. Samford, director of Air Intelligence, referred to \"our past experience in dealing with these things in many areas where we have had, oh, hundreds of fruitless in- tercept efforts in response to radar blips. It's not new with us at all.\" Reporter: \"I think we've all heard about this blip, but is that the thing that you sighted before in the past by the Air Force?\" Samford: \"Well, I can only say that I feel very sure that they were the same or reasonably the same.\" 7 (emphasis added). Unconscionable delays From this we can conclude that the UFO behavior over D.C. was not at all atypical. Then why was there such a reluctance to intervene one more time when the prohibited air space over the Capitol grounds was be- ing violated? In the face of the protracted presence of UFOs on both weekends, delays amounting to three and two hours were unconscionable. It seems clear that on .both occasions the Air Force was hoping against hope that the intruders would straightaway depart. If the UFOs were the bane of the Air Force's exist- ence, senior air traffic controller Harry Barnes was their pain in the neck. On July 19-20 Barnes vented his frus- tration at the lack of an Air Force response to his calls: \"In my conversation with MFS (Military Flight Ser- vice), ADW (Andrews) and the men on duty, we reached the point where we wondered just how much of this could go on and for how long before something could be done about it. I contacted Smoke Ring (the Air Defense Command Post) finally about 3:00 EST. They were doing nothing about it, so I asked if it was possible for something like this to happen, even though we gave them all this information, without something being done about it.\" 8 True disinterest? Instead of manifesting a heightened state of alert, the Air Force seemed to affect disinterest. Given the persistence of the aerial visitors and the importuning of Barnes and others, however, a token response be- came unavoidable. To understand why the Air Force would have preferred to shun any encounter or near encounter over the nation's capital, we should first rec-. ognize a circumstance which facilitated the possibil- ity of avoiding such a showdown: runway repairs forced the closing of the two bases that were in close proxim- ity to the White House. Three descriptions of the disposition of the capital area aircraft are given, the first two dealing with This is one interpretation by Journal staff artist Wes Crum of the July, 1952, Washington, D.C, sightings. Andrews.\"... Barnes called Andrews Field, across the Potomac in Maryland ... 'Are you sending up inter- ceptors?' Barnes asked quickly. 'No, the field's being repaired. Our jets are up at Newcastle.\" 9 \"Repair work on Andrews runways was keeping its jet interceptors on the ground. A squadron would have to be dispatched from Newcastle AFB in Delaware.\" 10 \"The squadron charged with protecting the capital from attack by air was usually stationed at Boiling Air Force Base, just across the Potomac, about two miles from the Capitol building. Earlier that day (July 19), however, the Air Force had secretly moved the squadron a hundred miles away to New Castle County Airport in Wilmington, DE, because of runway repairs at Boiling.\"\" (empha- sis added) The first statement (Keyhoe's) and the second (Clark's) disagree on the whereabouts of the Andrews aircraft, but agree as to their unavailability. The se- crecy attached to the redeployment of the Boiling jets can be accounted for by the desire to conceal from Soviet agents the vulnerability of the capital to air at- tack. At the same time, the jets positioned in Dela- ware, if on high-alert status,could have provided a de- gree of protection from conventional aircraft. An ex-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 2000 Page 15 planation is required, however, for the perplexing cir- cumstance that both facilities were allowed to be ren- dered inoperative simultaneously. Had the repairs at the two bases been handled sequentially, an ongoing protective presence at the doorstep of the Capitol com- plex would have been assured. It would be interesting to know when the repairs were contracted for, the pro- posed date of the repairs, and when the actual work began. Since at present we lack recollections from sur- viving pilots who belonged to the units involved, their superiors, or those managing the repairs, we would seem to be dependent on the efforts of enterprising ufologists who are expert at retrieving obscure docu- ments under the F.O.I.A. No planes available To summarize: As of the evening of July 19 the Boiling birds had flown the coop to an improvised base at the county airport near Wilmington, DE, while the flightless Andrews flock likely remained at roost, pre- sumably grounded by runway repairs. The Boiling squadron, even if transferred temporarily, should have been assigned the primary if not the sole and unalter- able duty of providing for the surveillance and air de- fense of vital Washington operations, including those of the White House and its tenant. Its Delaware har- borage should not have deterred it from maintaining its core commitment; indeed, it should have been kept on a hair trigger, poised to respond instantly at the first sign or rumor of an incursion into the capital air space. But if, at the time of the Washington National sightings, the jets were off investigating other reports, what were the priorities of the responsible officials? According to Hesemann, \"... there had already been a UFO alarm in upstate New York and all the fighters had been sent there.\" 12 In a quote attributed to the In- ternational News Service (INS) and published on July 28, the President, as if genuinely alarmed, responded on July 24 to the Air Force inaction: \"Following the instructions of the President, the Defense Department gives orders to shoot down all UFOs which refuse to land upon being told to do so...\" 13 A bit of bravado? If accurate, the INS dispatch confirms the involve- ment of the nation's highest office in what was an ap- parent attempt to reduce public anxiety by suggesting that UFOs were vulnerable and that the Air Force, though it had been laggard, could and would shoot them down when such action was justified. This bravado and bluff no doubt would have been exposed as such on the second weekend of overflights, even if the Presi- dent had not rescinded the original order. As it was, the shocking and probably unexpected repeat perfor- mance transpired without a shot being fired. The reappearance, together with the possibility of future appearances, required a top-level position re- versal to the earlier stance that UFOs were most likely unreal and at any rate not a threat. Taken at face value, the impression given by the Air Force of affecting dis- interest in the D.C. reports would seem to qualify as misconduct at the level of gross negligence or even dereliction of duty. A more believable hypothesis to explain the halting response to the calls of air traffic controllers is that the attitude of indifference was only feigned and that the July 19 redeployment, allegedly forced by runway repairs, was not merely coincidental with the imminent arrival of the UFOs, but was a de- liberate maneuver. Ruppelt provides the key to understanding how the concurrence of the transfer of the jets with the coming of the UFOs could have been other than a coincidence. Although this quotation is often mentioned in passing, its possible significance seems to have been insuffi- ciently recognized. 'Probably Washington' Here in its entirety for our further perusal is Ruppelt's eye opener: \"In some aspects the Washing- ton National sightings could be classed as a surprise- we used this as an excuse when things got fouled up- but in other ways they weren't. A few days prior to the incident a scientist, from an agency I can't name, and I were talking about the build-up of reports along the east coast of the United States. We talked for about two hours, and I was ready to leave when he said that he had one last comment to make-a prediction. From his study of the UFO reports that he was getting from Air Force Headquarters, and from discussions with his colleagues, he said that he thought that we were sit- ting right on top of a big keg full of loaded flying sau- cers. 'Within the next few days.' he told me, and I re- member that he punctuated his slow, deliberate remarks by hitting the desk with his fist, 'they're going to blow up, and you're going to have the granddaddy of all UFO sightings. The sightings will occur in Washing- ton or New York.' he predicted, 'probably Washing- ton.' The trend in the UFO reports that this scientist based his prediction on hadn't gone unnoticed. We on Project Blue Book had seen it, and so had the people in the Pentagon: we all had talked about it.\" 14 (empha- sis added). Awareness of UFO sighting buildup This passage implies that awareness at Blue Book, at the Pentagon, and among the scientists in the un- nameable agency of the buildup in UFO sightings and their progression inland from the east coast. This could lead the Air Force to fear that a UFO extravaganza might take place over a major metropolis. Ruppelt's scientist friend and his colleagues were not curiosity seekers; reports were being forwarded from the Penta-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 March 2000 MUFON UFO Journal gon for their analysis. It seems likely that the clout possessed by this group guaranteed that its input would merit the serious consideration of policy makers and~ thereby inform and influence high-level decisions. The basis of this article obviously rests on the as- sumption that these scientists had assured themselves that they had divined a purpose behind the apparent meanderings of the UFOs. If so, their conclusion might only have reflected a consensus that existed within the power structure. The \"granddaddy\" quote should be viewed in a context in which the UFOs, in the eyes of some very high officials, were already accepted as real and extraterrestrial. Maccabee cites a statement from an April 29,1952, memorandum, possibly written by Dr. Stephen Possony, a member of an Air Force Special Studies Group concerned with advanced delivery systems: \"The Air Force cannot assume the saucers are of non- terrestrial origin ...\" 15 Maccabee's judgment is that \"this was written by someone who knew what the top gen- erals were thinking.\" 16 Possony, or whoever the writer was, was probably cognizant of the revealing article in the April 7 issue of Life, titled \"Have We Visitors from Outer Space?\" Unofficially inspired by the Air Force, the article con- veyed the personal opinions of several very high-rank- ing officers in the Pentagon that the question posed by the article's title should be answered in the affirma- tive. There was also the possibility that a scattering of civilian and military leaders were privy to irrefutable evidence that the objects were from outer space. The bottom line is that if the runways at Boiling, only three miles from the White House, or at Andrews, seven miles farther away, had been unobstructed, no decision could have been justified that would have withheld the jets from immediate-if futile-action. However, a mandatory response that was timely and in force would only have acknowledged that the UFOs were real and lead to the realization that they boasted aerial technology and, by logical extension, weaponry vastly in advance of our own.

Filer, Director, Mutual UFO Network Eastern Region New physical evidence of abductions? Marilyn Ruben at Alien Abduction Experience and Research reports that a significant breakthrough in the search for trace physical evidence of alien abductions may have been uncovered in ordinary household dust, according to biophysicist Dr. William C. Levengood of Pinelandia Biophysics Laboratory of Michigan. Microscopic glassy particles have been found in household dust of individuals claiming to be abductees. The particles have been found in bedrooms, kitchens, family rooms, hallways, basement stairs, and so on. Glassy particles have not been found in dust where abductions are not known to occur. The particles come in a variety of shapes, including hollow or solid spheres. They are occasionally amber in color and vary in size from 1 micron (1/1,000 of a millimeter), or larger. Other more elongated particles include a \"pseudo crystal\" and an octopus shape. These forms are often clear and contain definite non-cellular, non-plant struc- ture. A visual inspection of the \"pseudo crystals\" un- der 450x magnification gives the appearance of a fiber optic arrangement, while the octopus structure some- times appears to have exploded outward at its center. Household dust is best collected from areas not com- monly dusted, such as the top ledges of doors and win- dow frames. Unexplainable whitish dust in recently cleaned rooms of-abductees' homes has also tested positive for these glassy particles. While abductees' homes have produced two or more styles of particles, none to date has produced all styles of particles."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 2000 Page 17 Witnesses observe craft in Rachel, Nevada, area In February, MUFON International Director Walt Andrus received a FAX on MUFON's electronic Gen- eral Cases Form 1 from Marcus Pizzuti reporting the flight of a unique air- craft directly over Rachel, NV, and parallel to State Highway 375 (designated in 1996 by the State of Nevada as the Extraterrestrial High- way). The Aug. 4, 1999, event was witnessed by eight people, all known ' personally by Pizzuti. •«-f-38 r*hite>; The witnesses were in the ( parking lot of Pickwick Market and Gas about a quarter of a mile south of the famous \"Little A'Le'Inn\" operated by Joe and Pat Travis, MUFON State Section Directors for Lincoln County. They heard the sound of a T-38 jet trainer at 10:30 a.m. and looked skyward to observe what appeared to be a big black jet aircraft that the T-38 was closely following to the left and rear. The arrow-shaped air- craft was 150 to 180 feet in length and five times the length of the accompanying T-38. The swept-back angle of the wings was greater than the F-l 17. The witnesses were all familiar with the F-l 17 Stealth \"Nighthawk\" fighter, since some were former employees at the Tonopah Training Installation (TTI), home to the Stealth Squadrons stationed there before being deployed to their permanent duty stations. They could not see any vertical stabilizer as the craft flew overhead and to the northwest. It was observed for eight minutes as it flew from the southeast through Coyote Pass to Rachel and proceeded over Queen City Sum- mit to Railroad Valley at an estimated 3000-4000 ft. above ground, when it passed over the witnesses. The object was flying slowly, and seemingly not emitting any noise (the T-38 could be heard), giving the witnesses the impression that it was cooling its en- gines in preparation for landing at Area 51, which was nearby to the southwest over the Papoose Mountains. The consensus of the experienced witnesses was that the craft was unlike any flying platform yet unveiled to the public. Although the witnesses felt the object was some sort of military aircraft, they refused to al- low their names to be used in this report for publica- tion, since they could easily be located in Rachel. This combination of day- time photo by Roger Sugden and special effects by Robert A. Taylor gives an indication of what the witnesses saw. EM effects, possible missing time Triangle-shaped object seen in Indiana by father and son By Roger Sugden Assistant State Director, N. Indiana A father and son were doing outside security work at a Ft. Wayne, IN, church on Sept. 11, 1999. At about 9:45 p.m., near the end of the service, they no- ticed a light in the NE sky. At first they thought it was an aircraft on the approach to the air- port. The father is also a private pilot, and commented that it looked too low to be on the glide path. As the object came closer, it became evident it was not an aircraft. It was a large diamond shape that was a very bright white color with a red and blue light that angled in toward the center of the object. As the object came closer they realized that it seemed very low in the sky and quite large. The son told me that he held his hand out at arm's length with his palm facing-his face, and that he could not block out the object. The object continued on a course directly toward them, and hovered overhead. The son told me it looked like it was wobbling or doing a falling leaf motion. Both the father and son were armed with rifles and handguns, and the son wanted to shoot at it. The fa- ther told him that would not be a good idea as \"it could be friendly.\" The father is an ex-police officer. The object then continued on its way until they lost sight of it. Bob Taylor and I investigated the sighting and found that there were EM effects involving the car battery and radio. There is also the possibility of missing time. Both men stated that after the event they were very thirsty and drank all the bottled water they had in the car, then went to a restaurant and drank some large ice teas. A week later the son entered the hospital with a kidney infection."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 March 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Stopping alien abductions? Dear Editor, I am working with abductees selected by Kentucky MUFON and Missouri MUFON on a project to stop abductions. Throughout the history of the human race, wars were fought with bigger and better weapons. In all of the wars until now, technology and numerical superiority determined victory. Since we are being invaded by an alien force from another world, we have a different kind of war. Our war with these beings is one of mind control, mind scan, and telepathic con- trol, as reported by Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, and Raymond Fowler. For mind numbing, Hopkins uses the term \"switched off people.\" I call this type of conflict \"telepathic war\" to differentiate it from a \"technology war.\" A \"tele- pathic war\" uses telepathy as a weapon in addition to the machines of a \"technology war.\" Until now, the aliens abducting humans could do so at will: they could \"switch off\" people or render them powerless, manipu- late people's thoughts and cause them to move against their will, project mental images to us, masquerade as a friendly or sexually attractive human, and scan our entire minds. They waged a \"telepathic war\" with no resistance from their victims. I have invented a device to defend us in a \"tele- pathic war,\" the kind of conflict we currently have with aliens. I call this device a \"thought screen\" because it prevents aliens from performing any kind of mental control over us. It blocks out all alien thought so hu- mans can no longer be manipulated or controlled, and it prevents aliens from completing mental communi- cation with us so people cannot be abducted. The term \"thought screen\" is derived from the sci- ence fiction novels of Edward Everett Smith, other- wise known as \"Doc\" Smith. The \"thought screen\" I developed is a shield around the head which blocks all telepathy and alien communication. It took several years to develop the device. I call it a \"thought screen helmet\" because it is a leather type of flyer's hat that holds shielding over the head. I had no results with the first ones I made. The sec- ond model was about 75% effective. I have had 8 abductees wearing it from 2 to 6 months. Six users report complete success, two users were overcome while partially conscious, succumbed to removing it, and were consequently abducted. The third model seems to be 100% effective; the person using it did not succumb as she did with the second model. No abductee has been taken while wearing the third model. So far, the third model \"thought screen helmet\" cuts off all alien telepathic contact and mind control. It is a turning point in the \"telepathic war\" with the aliens. Here are some quotes from users of the \"thought screen helmet\": \"We felt we did not need to include each day from the diary this time since each entry is getting to be repetitive. We have been sleeping very well and have had no unusual experiences since the evaluation of the Thought Screen Helmet. I must say we were a bit skep- tical as to it working, but we looked at it in compari- son to magnetic therapy that so many people have claimed works. Blocking or reflecting thought energy seems to be a most practical way of dealing with alien influences and in preventing abduction scenarios.\" \"Still nothing new to report here...so it must work! Congrats...my life has changed for the better...new job, new confidence etc.\" The final version of the \"thought screen helmet\" consists of a leather cap, which motorcyclists call a \"Rocky Bullwinkle Cap,\" with nine sheets of carbon impregnated polyolefin known by the 3M trade name of Velostat. Each sheet is individually cut, shaped and taped to the inside of the leather cap. Velostat is used to protect printed circuit boards and other electronic components from static electricity during production and handling. The second model \"thought screen hel- met,\" which was 75% effective, used twelve sheets of metalized plastic sheets; the type used is called \"metal in.\" This material is used to prevent static electricity damage to printed circuit boards and other electronic components. It is also made by the 3M company. The \"thought screen helmet\" is simple and relatively cheap to make. All that is required is a leather hat to hold the Velostat sheets, 9 Velostat sheets, and tape. The leather hat can be substituted with one of another material such as vinyl. Construction time for each helmet is about three hours. I am seeking about 8 more authentic abductees to try the helmet. It is available completely free. I need to work with established investigators and organiza- tions such as MUFON in selecting the abductees. Af- ter I establish that the third model helmet works effec- tively for at least ten abductees, I shall promote its use. That's the minimum amount of people I need to con- vince me that it works. I hope investigators will work with me to establish its effectiveness. If you are an authentic abductee who would like to try the \"thought screen helmet\" please contact me. I will send you one to try for free. Once I initially estab- lish that the \"thought screen helmet\" works, I will make a video and a bro.chure showing how to make one, plus have a website with full directions and sources for purchasing the materials. I will also have demonstra- tions for abductees and interested person at MUFON"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 2000 Page 19 events.

Real memory vs induced memory Editor's Note: The following comments are in regard to a recent book entitled The Abduction Enigma, by Kevin Handle, Russ Estes, and William Cone, which attempts to show that alien abductions can be explained by natural phenomena. The au- thors have already received considerable criticism for some of the material in the book, including the allegation that a majority of abductees are homo- sexuals-which would be very surprising news to re- searchers if true. Dear Editor, I would like to comment on the following statement of Randle, Estes, and Cone: \"According to the ex- perts and scientific evidence, there is no difference between a real memory and an induced memory.\" (pp. 286-7) As memories of what appear to be alien encounters often are traumatic, this class of memories is certainly relevant. And there is growing evidence that traumatic memories of real events can be distinguished from neutral or induced memories, or imagination. Scientific studies by Dr. Bessel van der Kolk using positron emission tomography (PET scans) clearly dis- cern the difference between the traumatic memories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and neutral memories (1). For example, as people are exposed to reminders of their trauma, there is unilateral increased activity in the areas in the right hemisphere involved in emotional arousal, as well as in the right visual association cor- tex. The left hemisphere shows diminished activation of Broca's area which suggests a decreased capacity to put the experience into language. These brain-im- aging techniques can help elucidate the relationship between false or induced memories, and real memo- ries of traumatic events, even alien encounters. There are also very real clinical markers that trauma leaves-which help to distinguish such memories. That is what the diagnosis and treatment of posttraumatic stress is all about. Psychiatrist Rima Laibow and other professionals such as myself have diagnosed PTSD that has seemingly been triggered by terrifying memory fragments of alien beings (2). Yet PTSD has not been reported in patients whose overwhelming stress is due solely to internally gener- ated states such as psychosis, delusions, or sleep pa- ralysis. Nor is there a single confirmed case of PTSD arising from \"false memory.\" Given the absence of ordinarily identifiable stressors, Laibow formulated Experienced Anomalous Trauma (EAT), a PTSD-like condition due to non-ordinary traumatic events such as close encounters. The Center for Treatment and Research of Experi- enced Anomalous Trauma (TREAT) was founded by Laibow as a not-for-profit organization in 1989. The researcher that Randle, Estes, and Cone seem to be relying on for their misstatements is probably Elizabeth Loftus. However, while Loftus has done some work on inducing false memories, these are by no means traumatic memories, i.e., memories of trau- matic events that induce PTSD. My own doctoral dis- sertation contains quite a bit on this very issue. I also wish to comment on the following statement of Randle, Estes, and Cone: \"A well-trained therapist knows that traumatic memories are not repressed....\" (pp. 216-7) Traumatic memories are often dissoci- ated and may be inaccessible to verbal recall or pro- cessing. Such memories are often re-experienced so- matically as sensations and affect. In other words, memory processing and recall for traumatic memories differ from that of non-traumatic memories. This accounts for their delayed recall (which is NOT the same as the Freudian notion of re- pression-a misunderstanding that has further muddied the waters of debate). But even in one of Loftus' own research studies 19 % of a sample of sexually abused women had lost all memory of their abuse at some time in their lives, and another 12 % had large gaps in their memories (3). Judging by the selected portions that I have read, I believe The Abduction Enigma is a half-baked affair so far as its assessment of psychological issues. Books such as Randle's serve as distractions from the all-too- real effort of people like my clients who hold trauma- and its transformation-in their very real physical bod- ies. - Dr. Janet Colli (1) Rauch S, van der Kolk BA, Fisler R, Alpert N, Orr S, Savage C, Jenike M, Pitman R (1996).

Hall The quality of case investigations reported in this issue, once again, is impressive, and we are indebted to Martin Jasek and Jim Kelly for their fine work. I noticed a very interesting contrast between the 1996 Yukon case and the 1999 Arizona helicopter incident: the former displayed all the established visual features of a UFO but none of the behav- ioral or performance features, while the latter strongly dis- played UFO-like extraordi- nary performance without correspondingly strong vi- sual characteristics. The Yukon UFO does ap- pear to have been very large, but the reliability of subjective estimates of apparent size often depends on the sophistication of the witnesses. I once inter- viewed a farmer who, in answer to my question about size, compared to something at arm's length, replied that it was as big as his tractor tire! I had to refrain from laughing, because that would have indicated an object right on top of him and time to \"hit the dirt.\" The main thing lacking in this case is any sign of extraordinary performance. The object always moves slowly and steadily, makes no sharp turns or rapid accelerations, and in fact, except only for the appar- ent size, sounds like a blimp or dirigible as far as its behavior is concerned. I'm not suggesting that's what it'was, but I would feel far more comfortable in accepting this one as an \"unknown\" if that possibility could be ruled out. One wonders if the crystal clear, cold air might have had something to do with the visual perception of what- ever this object was. A rule of thumb I have adopted over the years is that if a very large, brightly visible object or phe- nomenon remains in sight for a long period of time, is seen by widespread observers, and doesn't do any- thing extraordinary as far as motions are concerned, it probably is not really a UFO but some conven- tional object or natural phenomenon. In this case it is difficult to imagine what that might have been, other than a dirigible airship of some kind. The Phoenix, AZ, police helicopter case in some ways is a stronger one because of the well-witnessed extraordinary performance, but here one wishes that a silhouette could have been seen, the other pilots could have verified it, and/or radar had tracked some- thing. To emphasize my point, if the Yukon UFO had performed like the Arizona UFO, we would have an extremely strong case that could be cited in the same breath with well-known classic cases. Still, both are extremely interesting. Being an. empiricist to the bitter end, I am de- lighted to see good cases being reported and good investigations being conducted. The work is diffi- cult and often unrewarding, but it is the most im- portant activity of all for attempts to decipher the nature and meaning of UFOs. Although it is less thoroughly investigated, the Dec. 27, 1999, sighting by the pilot (reported in Filer's Files) who saw jets chasing a very bright ma- neuvering light while the Space Shuttle was landing is another intriguing report. Somebody should de- brief the witnesses on tape and, if this sort of activ- ity is common during shuttle launches and landings, as suggested, someone should \"stake out\" with good camera equipment. The UFO sightings in China, of course, made headlines in such major news organs as the New York Times. But typically for the Times, their reporting tended to be long on pop sociology and short on fac- tual details. Without good, detailed reports of the sightings, the UFO \"craze\" atmosphere there is sim- ply too conducive to the \"UFO reporting hysteria\" which has occurred numerous times in other places. Anything that looks the slightest bit unusual gets reported as a \"UFO\" under those circumstances, and the reporting channels (and our data base) become clogged with poor and worthless information. It was also good to see the rebuttal by Nicholas Schmidt to Jeff Saino's opinions on the \"morphing UFOs\" photo case in the MUFON Forum. Let's have some scientific dialogue, folks! That's what we all should be about."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal March 2000 Page 21 READER'S CLASSIFIED MUFON MERCHANDISE Wear official MUFON T-Shirts (royal blue printing on white cot- ton), sizes: S, M, L & XL.

For most of this period, Saturn (magnitude 0.2) lies above brighter Jupiter (-2.0). Much dimmer Mars (1.5) be- gins just to the right of Jupiter (only 1 degree apart on the 5th and 6th) and gradually moves upward past Sat- urn on succeeding evenings. (Saturn and Mars are 2 degrees apart on April 15 and 16.) From April 6-17 all 3 planets fit within an area of less than 6 degrees across and only about 5 degrees on the 14th and 15th. The last separation is the trio's most com- pact grouping over a span of 179 years (1901-2080)! Throughout most of the celestial spectacle in April, a bin- ocular field encompasses all three planets. Be sure to catch the rare and beautiful sight of the planetary trio accompa- nied by a lunar crescent at dusk on the 6th. All 4 objects will fit inside a 9 degree circle. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) should be observable by southern view- ers early in the month very low in the E before sunrise. Meteor Shower: A gibbous Moon in the sky after late evening ham- pers this year's observation of the Lyrid meteors at their peak on the morning of April 22. Though nor- mally only about 15 meteors per hour streak out of Lyra, those few are noticeably bright and swift. Moon Phases: New moon April 4; First quarter April 11; Full moon April 18; Last quarter April 26 The Stars: Leo the Lion crosses the celestial meridian in the S during midevening hours. The heavenly lion and its brightest star Regulus signified royalty and kingship in ancient times. Although the name Regulus (\"little king\") was assigned by Copernicus in the 16th cen- tury, the star earlier in history was regarded as one of the \"royal stars\" ruling the heavens. The Egyptian sphinx, with its human face and body of a lion, may have been modeled after the starry outline of Leo, as- sociating the royal power of the kings with the constellation. Also known by the Egyptians, their all-important day star, the Sun, appeared to pass very near Regulus on the first day of summer. UFO investigators should be alert to the atmospheric effects on rising and setting bright stars, especially at this time Vega, rising in the NE about 9 PM daylight time in midmonth, and Sirius, setting in the WSW about 11 PM. Boomerang-shape in Illinois By Bob Hewitt MUFON Research Specialist, Criminal Justice On Oct. 8, 1999, at approximately 11:08 p.m., I viewed an unusual boomerang-shaped object due west of my back deck in Godfrey, IL. It appeared to be trav- eling north/northeast as it increased in size. The ob- ject had a brilliant white light at the apex, which ap- peared to oscillate or rotate. There were smaller red, blue, and white lights that blinked, although not in any particular sequence. Instead of disappearing over the horizon, the object ascended until it disappeared. Addendum-I hesitate to mention the following; however, there might have been similar occurrences in other areas. North-northeast of my vantage point there appeared four clouds or hazy areas. Otherwise the sky was crystal clear. The light from the white light was so bright that there was a reflection coming from the four areas. The area in the lower right appeared to be responding with twinkling white light. When .the object disappeared, so did the hazy areas. For years we have lived under or near flight pat- terns from St Louis-Lambert Airport. I have observed jet strobe lights, light planes, helicopters and even an occasional blimp. Whatever it was, it was none of the above. There was no sound until about five minutes after the sighting when a jet plane appeared overhead.

Several members send an annual donation to MUFON to support our activities. Please continue to remember MUFON each year-these gifts are immensely appreciated. MUFON Headquarters Moving We will keep our members advised via the Journal as plans progress in the transition of the MUFON head- quarters to the Denver, GO, area during 2000. The move is being planned for the convenience of not only our members, but the MUFON staff. We look forward to improved and additional services under the leadership of the new International Director, John F. Schuessler, who will take over the reigns on July 16, 2000. UFO Sighting Reports A radical improvement in the lead articles published in the monthly Journals was noted starting with De- cember 1999. This has been due to the fact that our State/Provincial Directors and State Section Directors are writing narrative reports of their UFO investiga- tions and submitting them to the International Director for publication. I know that there are many other outstanding reports that are only getting exposure in the pages of MUFON State and Chapter publications. This is an invitation to share these reports on an international level with your constituents worldwide. Supporting the MUFON Journal MUFON is very concerned about the decrease in the number of Journals mailed each month over the past few years. Although the Journal is stronger and has a greater circulation than some other well known UFO publications in this country and elsewhere, we cannot afford to become complacent. MUFON is fully cognizant that the web sites and e- mail communications are our most serious competi- tion, as with most other print publications, but there are many articles, photos, and drawings in the Journal that are not found on the Internet. In addition, the Jour- nal is physically more convenient to read, as well as serving as a valuable resource for future reference. Many readers have their Journals bound, keeping them as permanent library books. The value of back issues of the Journal is clear when one visits dealers in UFO publications and notes the prices for back copies. We took a membership survey in 1997 in which our members evaluated both the MUFON UFO Jour- nal and the organization itself. Based on this survey, many changes were made, and we have had numerous positive comments. These comments are directly measured in the re- duced percentages of lost memberships since July 1998. But the Board of Directors is not satisfied with the loss of any subscribers, since MUFON at one point had more than 5,000 members. There are at least three things you can do to help keep the Journal the premier monthly UFO publica- tion in the world. First, when you receive the reminder to renew your subscription, stop to seriously consider the value you are receiving each month in documented UFO information, and renew while .you are thinking about it. Second, personally invite your friends and relatives to subscribe to the MUFON UFO Journal, or give them a gift subscription. Third, mention the Jour- nal in a positive way when you are on the Internet. Your comments and efforts to promote MUFON and the Journal are much appreciated.
