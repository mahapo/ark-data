Cerney, UFO investigator, who heads a San Francisco Bay Area group and is now MUFON Director for northern California, recently told of his discovery of unpublished reports of UFOs over or near Holloman Air Force Base, White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, One report was obtained from an aircraft mechanic now employed by an aerospace firm in the San Francisco area. In the summer of 1958, \"the mechanic whom we'll call Mr. X was employed as a civilian at Hollomen Air Force Base, southwest of Alamongordo, N. M. It was dusk one evening when X and another mechanic were working on the lending gear of a plane, just outside the main aircraft hangars* Halting a moment to rest a stiff neck, X was surprised to see some- thing strange out tov.ard the open area of the field. It was a noiseless, disc-shaped object not more than 50 yards distant. It looked something like a wide, thick-brimmed hat. The top was dome- shaped with several oblong port holes visible on the side facing X* The object was wobbling as it hovered only a few feet off the ground. As it tilted upward, three ball-like landing gears could be seen on its base. <J -'hey extended down slightly through whf-t appeared to be metallic openings similar to landing gear doors on conventional aircrafto The outer rim of the object was thick and flat and contained a cir- cular ring of whet resembled louvers of some type and they moved around the dome at a steady speed in treadmill fashion. X estimated the craft to be about 25 feet in diameter and 6 or 7 feet high. A bluish light shown frcm the windows. A wide bend of some highly polished metal, as brass, extended around the dome, and there appeared to be antenna on the top. The entire object was metallic in color, but the actual color could not be determined in the dusk* Short jet noEzles were evenly spaced along the rim's outside edge* X stared at the strange craft, then suddenly remembered his compan- ion and called to him. By the time he had dropped down from his work on the landing gear, he caught just a quick glimpse of the craft as it shot away at a high rate of speed. Shortly after the incident, the two mechanics were approached by Air Force representatives who asked the two to look at a book of photographs of uFOs and to select the one most nearly resembling the object they had seen. l'hey learned that personnel in the Base control tower had also been watching the UFO. 'J-'he two men found a similar photo after looking through more than 300 pages of all types of UFOs. Both were told not to talk about the sighting to anyone and were asked to sign a statement to that effect. Mr. Cerny learned of the sighting from a friend of Mr. X and then obtained an interview on the condition the mechanic's real name would be kept confidential. A report wes mede to Robert B. Kline and David Branch by Mr. Cerny and a lengthy article was written for the Santa Ana \"Register,\" appear- ing in the Nov. 15, 1972 issue. Vie again mention the excellent work being done by Mr. Kline and Mr. Branch and thank Prof. Chas. Kahlert for sending, us clippings from the \"Register.\" Another report by Mr. Cerny will appear in the next issue of SKYLOOK.

Probably a Blimp Editor's Note: Mrs. Ann Druffel, of Pasadena, ^alif., and a Field Investigator for MUFON, made a careful investigation of a number of \"UFO\" reports by witnesses in four separate locations in Santa Ana, California, and states the evidence points to the Goodyear advertising blimp as the probable cause of the sightings. We agree with her in feel- ing the report should be given as it will add some knowledge to the field, concerning honest misinterpretation under unusual circumstances and psychological conditioning. The following is written from her ten- page report which we have to \"cut\" because of space limitations. Mrs. Brown (not her real name) was interviewed by Mrs. Druffel on January 7th, and was described as being friendly, cooperative and in- telligent. She considers herself thoroughly familiar with all manner of aircraft, including blimps, which she has seen \"many times.\" She consid- ers the object seen \"a real UFO.\" At 6:25 p.m. on January 2, Mrs. Brown's daughter, whom we 1 11 refer to as \"Daisy\" had run home frightened, reporting that she and her 10-year old friend had seen a strange aerial object while on an errand. Mrs. ^rown, familiar with UFO literature, went out to her darkened yard to look, but first turned on the garage light. In a few minutes she saw an object \"like an amber-colored meteor\" approaching from the northeast. In a matter of seconds, it had reached her neighborhood and \"dropped straight down out of the sky\" until it looked huge, filling a large portion of the eastern sky. ^t hovered silently above while she counted from 5-7 seconds. She described the body of the object as metal- lic gray, shaped like two saucers placed rim to rim, with the rims not touching — between, around the center, was a brilliant amber-colored band of solid light, of a beautiful shade she found impossible to describe. A rounded dome was seen on top, and at the stme time she could see part of the bottom where a square door was outlined with alternate red and green flashing lights. She saw two antennae projecting from the top, and these two were outlined in identical red and green flashing lights. It seemed about twice as far above her head as a guy wire crossing her yard, an estimated 120-1A.O feet high, After hovering some 7 seconds, she heard a whine like an \"electric generator,\" such as her family used while living in Oerrnany. As the whine began, trie object began to move and \"went straight up\" and \"very fast,\" Then she could see the lights, but no outline, ^s it moved to the soutwest, it srank to the size of a star and disappeared. Daisy was also interviewed and is described as being a cooperative, well-spoken child, age 12, truly puzzled and frightened over the sight- ing. She wes reluctant to speak at first because she \"saw something different from what mother saw.\" When assured this did not make any difference, she told what she had seen. She and her friend noticed bright lights in the east at about 6:20 p.m. In less than 10 seconds, the object traveled closer and hovered for a few seconds to the left of a large, leafeless tree, some distance to- ward the southeast. i he girl said she could distinguish a tall dome on top, an oval-shaped silvery-gray body, and three bands of colored light circling the middle. The lights seemed to spin around the center at a slower rate than the object, which rotated also. The band on top was a glowing red, the middle a glowing green, and the bottom a dull, yellow- gold. The object seemed to \"tip\" and Daisy saw what she thought was a rectangular door on the bottom, outlined by a black crack. The object seemed to the frightened children to be hovering right over the telephone vjires nearby. 'J-hey ran to a small store a few feet away and watched from the door until the object moved slowly to the west. Then they ran home. Daisy refused to go outside with her mother."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Mrs. \"Smith\" (real name in files), a well educated woman with a re- sponsible position with a computer-processing firm, was on her way home in her car when she saw the object between 6:30 and 6:45 p.m. The light- ed object seemed to be hovering over some homes across the street. She could not determine a distinct shape, but rather a row of four rectangular \"panels,\" clear-cut, colored from left to right vivid shades of red, green, yellow and blue. Above and below the panels were two rows of small, off-color white lights, the bottom row shorter tnan the top row. Frightened, tors. Smith did not stop the car, but went on slowly. A hen the \"panels\" began to blur as the whole body seemed to rotate, then a \"flash of multicolored lights around the center as if the thing were turning very fast.\" Upon information provided by Mrs. Druffel, Bob Kirkpatrick wrote an article which appeared in the Jan. 24th \"Register.\" it was hoped the publicity would bring reports from other witnesses as the investigation continued. Mrs. \"Jones\" reported she spotted a brightly lighted \"pretty\" object from her front yard on Jan. 2, 1973 before 7:00 p.m. ^he lights were arranged in the shape of a circle along a fairly clear-cut edge of the object she described as \"something like aluminum\" in color. She ssid four or five large, glaring white lights were interspersed more or less regularly around the circle, with several smeller lights of various colors arranged between each white light. The smeller lights were blue- green, gold Camber) and red. Something in the center of the object seemed to be revolving, she said. The object hovered hovered approximately two minutes and seemed to \"quiver\" and the lights, though steady and glaring, seemed to \"flicker\" at times. /Editor's Note: Here we have good sighting reports. If it stopped here, we T d all be convinced UFOs were seen. Too many reports do stop at this hslf-way point. The professional investigator investigates.7 Mrs. Jruffel called the LTA (Li&hter-than-air) Facility, Marine Corps Base and was first told the glimp had not been in the sky on January 2nd. Pursuing the matter, she was referred to a Captain Oarvin who said they did not have records available and advised her to contact the Car- dena Goodyear Blimp Base. Tom Riley, an official at the base, believed the blimp was the possible source of the lights seen and confirmed that it had been flying that night and that possibly it had gone into Santa Ana since the weather con- ditions as described( checked earlier by Mrs. J-dabel Epperson at the Orange County Airport] would be perfect flying weather for the trip. Mrs. Druffel also learned that 1969 the advertising blimp has been fitted out with 7,560 light bulbs in four colors—blue, green, red and yellow--which can make numerous shapes and patterns of colored lights on a sign 100 feet long and 25 'feet high. '-'ne of the patterns^comprises three wide bands, red, yellow and green, across the signboard. Presently, in this pattern, the words \"Goodyear Steelguerd tfadial Tires\" are spelled out through the yellow band, t is possible thst the yellow band can be lit at times. The patterns of light flash for about 15-30 seconds, then the advertising appears (also in color), alternating with the solid pattern again. Another pattern comp- rises four \"panels,\"--red, green, yellow and blue. Mrs. Druffel also talked at length with Inspector Barton, Federal Aviation Investigations, L ong Beach, Calif., and he too was of the opinion the sightings were caused by the blimp, since he lives near the Gardena base and has seen the colored patterns many times. He stated that sometimes the blimp will fly around without advertising for longer than 30 seconds. He could equate Daisy and Mrs. Smith's sightings with the patterns seen and also Mrs. Brown's, except for the lighted \"antennae\" and \"door.\" h e described a red rotating beacon at the top at night and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"a red light on the left side on the gondola and a green light on the right side. There is no minimum altitude over open fields or sparsely settled areas at which the blimp is required to fly, but a minimum altitude of 500-1000 feet over inhabited areas. She was informed that blue lights on the blimp often seem white from a distance* There is a white light at the tail and the nose, and a rotating red light at the bottom of the blimp as well as on top. Mrs. D ru ffel talked to Nick Nicolary, the blimp pilot on January 2nd and learned he had, indeed, flown over Orange Bounty, including Santa Ana, starting from Gardena at 4:43 and arriving back at 5:00 p.m. With a cruising speed of 35 mph, it was very likely that the blimp was over the Santa Ana area between 6:15 p.m. end 7:00 p.m. Visibility was exceptional (50 to 60 miles). There were no erratic winds, and they cruised at 1000 feet, the optimum altitude to allow the greatest number of persons to see the advertising. He stated that surely anyone within a mile of the blimp could read the ads, but also stated the patterns only are flashed for up to 30 seconds between ads. In regard to Mrs. Jones 1 sighting, it was the pilot's opinion that the blimp would never appear as a round circle of lights at any aspect, even head on. Mrs. Druffel wrote: \"It is the considered opinion of the SKYNET investigator, and confirmed through consultation with Mrs. Idabel Epperson and Mr. Adrian Vance, that the ^oodyear blimp was the probable cause of all the sightings.\" In the case of both the Brown witnesses, the main lighted patterns seen correlate with known blimp patterns. The \"rotating\" could be an illusion caused by lights flashing off and on in sequence. It is noted i^rs. thrown was familiar with UFO literature and no doubt expected to see a UFO on being alerted by her daughter. 'A'his could have prompted her to \"see\" a dome on top and \"lighted antennae and door.\" i'he illusion of the object going up \"fast\" cculd have been caused by the blimp's lights being off a few seconds, then seen again from a different angle. The antennae in Daisy ! s case might be explained by the fact the object was seen near a leafless tree, and the girl might have misinterpreted 2 twigs strategically placed as projections from the object itself. The \"door\" is probably a rectangular marking on the bottom of the gon- dola. The fact that the witnesses were either frightened, excited, or startled at seeing an object regarded as strange and alien sets up an emotional condition where the human eye tends to enlarge objects being stared at and the mind is easily deceived. The witnesses were all sin- cere in describing what they saw—or thought they saw. We are leaving out some very good reports in order to give this much space to Mrs. Druffel T s report; but we feel this should be read and studied—not only for the information re blimps (and most of us need to learn more nbout this) but as a fine example of investigation and identification—a report that goes ALL the way. We are all VERY happy to have Mrs. Duffel and her co-workers with MUFON. —Ye Ed.

Deputy Vernon Bates said the sightings occurred about 10:30 p.m. and were substantiated by about six persona. While at the scene of the sighting, the investigating deputies lost radio contact with the Limestone County jail. On leaving, radio communication was resumed. One woman said the objects were seen to hover, then suddenly in^ crease speed, slow down, and hover again. ±he objects were said to contain spinning lights and witnesses said they heard loud buzzing sounds. In the Dec. 29 edition of the Times, other sightings were reported. A musical group from Florence driving along U.S. Highway 72 West said they saw two brightly-lit hovering objects in the vicinity of the Jetport turnoff from U.S. 72, the night of the 25th. Limestone County Sheriff M. W. Evans told the press the reports could probably be traced to fireworks. (Credit: John F. Schuessler) It Dropped From the Sky Herb Krug, 18, was working on his parents' farm near Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., Monday, Jan* 29, 1973, when a \"thing\" about as large as a basketball fell from the sky, smashed into the ground near Krug and scattered debris.

The\"Chicago Daily News\" reported the incident on Jan, 31 and stated NORAD asked for results of tests on the material. A pathologist at St. Joseph 1 s Hospital in Marshfield said the chunk of bluish ice was from an overhead airplane. North Central Airlines said one of its jets flew over the area about the time Krug saw the ob.lect. (Credit? Thomas E. Miller.) Mystery Lig.ht Over Chicago A mysterious bar of light appeared over Chicsgo, 111*, Tuesday, Jan. 23, 1974, and continued to glow brightly for more than an hour according to hundreds of reports turned in to the Police Department, the Adler Planetarium and the news media. Nearly all observers described the sight as a bar of bright light lingering about 30 degrees above the horizon, beginning about 9 p.m. and dimming and then disappearing about 10:30 p.m. Color descriptions varied from pure white to light blue to reddish brown* Lee Shapiro, an astronomy graduate student at Northwestern Univer- sity's Dearborn Observatory, also saw the light and described it not only as one bright bar but as at least three streamers of light, one glowing more brightly than the others. Based on this description, Northwestern astronomer i>r. J. Allen Hynek said the phenomenon appeared to resemble an aurora borealis, which, he said, in rare instances has been sighted in directions other than north. But the conflicting directions reported would seem to preclude this, he said. The sky was very clear at the time of the sighting. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Weather Service both reported that their radar did not register anything unusual at the time. (Source: \"Chicago Sun-Times,\" Jan. 24, 1973.

On January £ at 10:15 a.m. Billy Gowan, a freshman at East High School in Ellenboro was distracted from a phone call by a sound de- scribed as \"a funny squeling sound\" on his radio, and he saw a small UFO which landed in his beck yard about 50 feet away. As the youth approached it, the red and gold object rose up, making a sound \"like a shotgun firing\" which blew snow as it flew away. A three inch hole was found on the landing side with black particles on the snow around it. A he hole was filled with a greenish-looking fluid.Investigation is still under way. On January 16 nesr the Country Club road in Winston Salem at 7:00 p.m. a local attorney and his wife found their car being paced by a domed top UFO having three red lights and one large white light on its bottom. i he UFO made a sound \"like a high flying plane\" and was watched for three to five minutes. Both witnesses reported a \"weight- lessness feeling\" as the object moved over their car. On January 17 near Concord end on Interstate 35 headed toward Greens- boro at 7=45 p.m. an Akers Motor Lines trucker, Gerald Summey, of Charlotte, and staff writer Edith Low and photographer Tommy Franlin (who were assigned to follow Summey to Harrisburg, Pa., after he re- ported repeated UFO buzzing incidents over a three month period, all saw a mystery object on three different occasions and photographed it twice. Five other truck drivers, who had driven with Summey, had seen the U FO approach his semi-trailer truck on numerous occasions near Charlottesville, Virgina; Rock Hill, S. D., and Charlotte, N. C. The Charlotte News personnel, as well as truckers Mike Robinson, Max Rhom, Pleasant Walter, Normen ^elf and Douglas Pye described the object as being \"oval surrounded by a greenish-white edge and a rosy red center\" and as \"like a domed-saucer having a black base with holes sll around the base area.\" \"^t w^s reported to have landed on one occasion near Woodbridge, Virginia. When it took off. and was being watched through binoculars, the UFO fired something \"like a shooting stars or tracer fire.\" The witnesses remain frightened and puzzled. On January 19, 13 miles south of Gaffney, South Carolina, on High- way IS at 11:25 p.m. a Cherokee County youth encountered what he thought was a car wreck and lighted patrol cers. Upon closer approach lie found a landed UFO with a domed top and tripod landing gears sitting in the middle of the highway and surrounded by a dozen \"strange looking men.\" The men were dressed in white coveralls with white gloves. A band of lights at the base of the dome flashed green, blue, red and white colors. The UFO occupied three-fourths of the highway and prevented his car from passing. A door and a ladder were noticed on the bottom portion of the UFO. It appeared to be about 15 feet in diameter and almost as high and perhaps made of fiber glass, •'•he youth, by now badly scared, fled on a secondary road and made.his report to authorities. Another witness (a woman who refused to release her name i'or publicity, fearing ridicule) reported her car wes followed previously at night on January 15, near the site of the alleged landing, and that it hovered above her home for some time before finally leaving the area rapidly. Three other witnesses said they saw mysterious lights flying in the area, one on the night of the landing. The incident is still under investigation. Credit: George D. Fawcett, 607 N.

A catalog of these cases has been completed and will be discussed a- long with new high rated cases at the 1973 MUFON symposium in Kansas City. The following is a brief look at the events of 1972. Between Feb. £, 1972 and Oct. 1, 1972 there were 35 trace cases reported. These sites were found in ten countries. 1J -he distribution was as follows: United States 17 ^ew Zealand $ Norway 1 Mexico 1 Spain 1 Africa 1 Italy 1 Australia 2 France 2 Canada 1 Alleged landing sites were found in 12 states:—Missouri, 3; Kansas, 1; Iowa, 4; N. Carolina, 1; Pennsylvania, 2; Colorado, 1; Alabama, 1; Cal- ifornia, 1; Texas, 1; Alaska, 1; Arizona 1. The peak month during 1972 was June with 30$ of the total reports. The peak time was 2100 with 27% of the reports taking place in that time period. No UFO was seen in 57^; a single witness in 14/6; and two or more witnesses in the remaining 29%* In the multiple witness cases, the number of witnesses ranged from two to ten. °f the total reports, five seem to be of very high quality. Unlike the total esses (515 ) which involve a disc-shaped UFO in 66% of the cases, the UFOs in 1972 were most often described as a bright light source on or near the ground. In two of the high quality re- ports the object was described as (1) metallic, about seven feet long with flashing lights and no sound; (2) metallic, 15 feet long with two windows at the top, red lights at each end and a flashing white light at the base. 'i'he object was football-shaped, no sound. Animal, human or mechanical effects were reported in ll^fa of the ceses. Imprints were reported in five of the cases, these involved four imprints arranged in a square in one case and three imprints arranged in a triangle in three of the Ccses. The remaining report involved a number of imprints arranged in no particular pattern. k&% of the sites were described as burned; 29% as depressed and 23% as dehydrated. 77°/o were circular, 25% oval. lj -he landing sites ranged from three feet to thirty-three feet in diameter. Most of the sites were between six feet and ten feet in diameter. Sites most often re- ported were seven feet in diameter. The 1972 reports compare very well with the total cases. A time peak at 2100 is found in 1972 and in the total esses. Two or more wit- nesses in 29% of the 1972 cases, 30% in the total. Of the 515 cases, the sites were between 16 and 20 feet in diameter as a peak; a secondary peak is noted between 4 and £ feet. This secondary peak matches the 1972 peak for site diameters.

Accord- ing to authorities, arriving planes were fed into holding patterns around the area by radar crews in Cleveland. Planes then were brought down at two-to-five minute intervals. NO indication was given of the cause of the electrical failure. It was only stated thtt a similar situation occurred once before, several years ago. According to Stan Gordon, director of Westmoreland Bounty UFO Study Group, unidentified flying objects were prevalent in the skies last night. Members of the study group are checking on the possibility that the electrical difficulties could have been caused by the objects. There is no proof at this time, he said, that it w?s caused by the strange objects, although often electrical difficulties do occur when there are numerous sightings. Sightings were especially numerous over the Jeannette-Irwin area, Gordon said. Formations of five to six bright, round objects hovered for more than 10 minutes before breaking up into two separate formations and heading in the direction of McKeesport. Individuals who sighted them claimed thct they hovered low over homes in the area. There were many aircraft and bright stars visible, he admitted; how- ever, often both aircraft and the objects were visible at the same time. Watchers were able to distinguish between the two* When aircraft moved in the direction of the objects, the objects always moved off silently in another direction. * * * Sightings of cigar snaped, wing- less objects were reported in the Derry-Pleasarit Unity area. Many ob- servers claimed to see them hovering silently over cars, '\"hen the autos halted and the driver emerged from the car, the object would move off. ' A he above is a direct quote from the News-Dispatch, 'i'he following is from a report to riKYLOOK by Mr. Gordon, giving more details: —It was a warm, crisp and clear nignt in the upper forties. Sky conditions excellent with temperature inversion apparent. Many of the people taking in the nice weather apparently had tneir heads turned skyward as dozens of UFO sightings were reported throughout the Central West- moreland County area and unconfirmed sightings were made in the Forest Hills area outside of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County. First reports of a UFO csir.e into the Control Center at 7 PM from New Stanton where several people were watching a bright white light in the sky. It was identified as a star. At 7:25 a number of witnesses in West Point City outside of the city of Ureensburg reported the sighting of several objects including one pie shaped object with a dome on top and red lights going around the bottom. Aircraft were observed at the same time. At 7:40 additional witnesses from West Point reported several bright white lights in the sky which, in this case, appear to have been nothing but aircraft tail lights. Investigation is continuing into the original report. ^At 9:05 the first of dozens of reports of a formation of 5 orange spherical objects over the Irwin area was received. Calls were re- ceived simutaneously from Irwin residents as well as Jeanette witnesses located only a few miles away. Preliminary data indicates that the formation was observed for over 10 minutes, possibly much longer than one large object hovered in the sky while the other four objects broke into groups of two and moved in the direction of McKeesport which would be in the same basic direction of Forest Hills. 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Some Irwin residents reported hysterically that a huge cigar shaped object was hovering very low near their homes and that the objects were definitely not aircraft. To quote from one witness report: \"What I saw next left me in fear like seeing God. It appeared to be as low as the largest plane would fly. It appeared quite large and its shape was cigar in appearance. The whole front end was like a woman's diamond or a bee T s honeycomb and was many bright lights, white in color * * the back was giving off a red light. i ts motor roar was half way between an auto and a plane, and it was a humming smooth roar.\" The witnesses observed the object with binoculars as well as the naked eye. Many Irwin and Jeanette area residents phoned local police stations as well as radio station WHJB in Greensburg * * * Reports received the next day indicated that a formation of five objects had hovered over the Crabtree area and was observed by wit- nesses located in the Latrobe and Pleasant Unity areas. A 'his sighting occurred at about 9:15 PM and the area of the sighting is located about 7 miles northeast of Greensburg. Irwin is about 3 miles southwest of ^reensburg. Also, reports from iJerry about 4 miles northeast of Latrobe about a large cigar shaped object without wings is very interesting and is under investigation. The witness said that the object flew past the windshild of his car about 10:15 PM. He then stopped the car and got out to watch the object, that was then motionless in the low sky. It then changed direction in mid air and moved over the top of the wit- ness' car. Reports began to corne in from other parts of the county including ^reensburg, Carbon, Pleasant, Unity, Lycippus as well as from the Apollo area located about 17 miles southwest Greensburg where reports were made of three ember objects breaking and joining formation and being observed for over half an hour. Some of the reports have already been explained as misidentification of aircraft and stars. A considerable number of the reports, however, are very good and are yet to be explained. Interesting was the fact that at the same time the UFO sightings were occurring, the radar facility used for landing aircraft at Greater Pittsburgh Airport was out of order and the planes were laddered throughout about a 20 mile radius waiting to be vectored in from Cleveland Center radar. Many people will jump to the conclusion that the UFOs were nothing but the numerous aircraft in the areas; however, almost all witnesses reported that aircraft were observed at the same time and could be easily distinguished. Also, some witnesses reported that if an aircraft came near the object, the UFO would either completely disappear and reappear when the aircraft moved away, or the UFO would m&ke a turn and move away from the aircraft, * * * We are also checking a report of a ball of light that appeared to be resting in an isolated field near Trauger in the vicinity of Pleasant Unity on the same night. The report of the sightings was carried by area radio and 'J-V stations and made front pages of most of the newspapers in the area of the sight- ings. The next day WHJB radio 1 s morning talk show was a discussion of the sightings and the station interviewed me by telephone about our in- vestigation. Many called in to report what they had seen.

Brill No. IS The following article was published in the December 1970 issue of \"The Bulletin of Amateur Astronomers\" Cluj, Romania, and it was writ- ten by an electronic engineer of Cluj, one Mr. Florin Gheorghita, who has completed a book on the UFO phenomenon and has been informed that this book has been approved for publication in Romania later this year.—J.B. SOME INTERESTING UFO OBSERVATIONS OVER CLUJ The citizens of Cluj did not remain indifferent to the serious aspects of the observations of UFO's over their city. Many of these people had the opportunity to observe for themselves the interesting evolutions as they appeared on the sky. As stated in the press, these phenomenon manifested their presence overwhelmingly during 1966, de- creasing gradually during 1969- Surely the most startling event was the photographing of such a metallic flying object on August Id, 1963, which appeared above the Heciu forest. The publication of these photographs of the \"UFO of Cluj\" produced a deep interest in Romania as well as abroad. the Veracity of the original negatives having been for quite some time verified previously by qualified photo- graphic experts. 'Ihe city of Cluj, became known internationally and the respective photograps of the UFO being of some of the best such photos ever taken in the World, Articles on this observation were published in a number of foreign publications such as: \"Flying Sau- cer Review,\" Nov. 1969 - Condon, \"Phenomenes Spatiaux,\" July 1970 - Paris and \"U.F.O. Reporter,\" July 1970 - Canada, to mention only a few. Another much discussed eventwas the persistence of the curious pyramidal UFO, which appeared above the center of the city on the afternoon of September 19, 1963. Although for most of the hundreds of people who followed its maneuvers, this observation remained only a curiousity, photograps were taken by a well-known press photographer, with much precision, and these photograps once developed revealed an unexpected content. The object in question was certainly not any type of research balloon as its behavior did not allow for this and the five excellent photographs confirm that it did not appear as a balloon would have on the pictures taken. A report on this observation was published in the newspaper \"Faclia\" in which it was reported that in several other towns similar observations had been reported as having been observed by the citizens of these communities also at the same hour as the Cluj observation. These photographs were also some of the best such photographs I have ever seen. On the evening of November 15, 1963, while 1 was in the company of the V. Fenesan family (3 individuals), who reside at 63 Manastur Street, we all observed a very interesting sight which was as follows: At about 3:30 p.m. looking fortuitously to the clear night sky, we saw coming from the north and traveling south, a brilliant fly- ing object above the Hoia forest. I estimated its altitude to be approximately 5000 meters and it was traveling at a fantastic speed, which I again estimated at about 6000 kilometers per hour* Initially we all thought that it might be a satellite* £ut, when it was at an angle of about fifty degrees above che horizon line, it made a number of zig-zag maneuvers at very sharp and exact angles, :even though it was moving at this terrific speed. Under what appeared to be an automatic command, after having continued to a straight line path of 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"S travel, it would begin to repeat the zig-zag maneuvers at angles of approximately forty degrees and it was repeated a total of three times in all, with exactly the same amplitude and under the same sharp angles each time. Such a serial performance cannot yet be achieved by any man-made aircraft that I am aware of at this time* No man-made vehicle would be capable of performing those maneuvers while traveling at such a speed. For an example, any aircraft fly- ing at a speed of 1000 kilometers per hour would need more than three full kilometers to perform a right angle turn. The curb of such a turn would demand at least this much area due to the inertia involv- ed in such a maneuver. This brilliant object had a constant brightness much more intens« than the visible stars in the sky. The color if its light was a white-yellowish and its size was a little greater than that of the average star, ^n the silence of the darkness of that hour, no noise of a motor could be detected by any of us. The repeated zig-zag man- euvers gave me the impression of an intention of this object of avoid ing any detection by any ground.radar installation in the area. (See sketch 1 for movements of this object). I witnessed a quite similar evolution, also very interesting, about a month later, completely by chance in the company of the amateur as- tronomer R. Irimies and some of his neighbors from the same courtyard (a total of six observers). It would have been around December 15th of that same year (1968). This case was reported by us to the Observatory in Bucharest. We observed a bright object coming from the north and traveling with a much reduced speed when we first noticed it. It suddenly stopped and hovered over the city, after awhile it altered its flight path and changed its direction towards the west. After a few moments it again stopped and hovered. Then this object accelerated end disappeared toward the south at a great speed. Iowa Report Mr. and Mrs. Mike Braun, of Fredericksburg, la., were by returning home from bowling at New Hampton about 11:45 Ralph DeGraw p. m. December 14 (or the 21st) 1972. About one mile east of the junction of Highways 63-13, Mrs. Braun no- ticed a large white light about the size of a cup held at arm's length about 45 degrees above the southern horizon, ^he said the light was in sight for five to ten minutes and when it disappeared, it simply \"went out\" like turning cf f a light, 'i'he light did not change in color, size, shape or altitude end was brighter than a car headlight She could not determine the distance but thought it mipht be a mile or a mile and a half away.

The report appeared in the March 3, 1971 edition of the \"Dayton Daily News.\" Leon Turner, 30, of 110 Vandergrift Road, Dayton, was working as an engineer at radio station WPFB in Middletown in Sept. 1, 1971, when someone called the station and said he saw strange lights near the station transmitter. Burner called Noah Gross, a minister living near the tower. Gross and his wife and children went out to look and called back* \"Buddy, there's something right above the trees, hovering, There's a red and green pulsating light, and like fire falling from the sky* n After work Turner drove around most of the night, hoping to see the object and \". . then just about daybreak I saw it.

In July a soccer match was halted temporarily while thousands of fans watched a long cigar-shaped UFO with eight small satellite objects maneuvering above the stadium at Campos, Bra- zil. In August a group of girl scouts fled from an overnight camp out at Droitwich, England, when a 30 foot UFO appeared forty feet above the ground nearby. In August hundreds reported a yellow UFO with wing-like structures over Hawahete, Ceylon. In September po- lice in dozens of cities in Kansas were swamped by phone calls by excited residents who spotted UFOs, as did the police themselves, North Carolina, the Tar Heel State, didn't miss out on the wave of 1972 UFOs as such reports were received from: Newton, Shelby, Hickory, Maiden, Winston Salem, Mount Airy, Charlotte, Eden, Stone- ville, Mooresville, Le, wisville, Kernersville and Cullowhee. . just to mention a few of the towns and cities on the UFO survey tour.

While UFO photographs and movie films were being taken in Strongs- ville, Ohio; Mart, Texas; Quincy, Illinois; Cando, North Dakota; Corrientes, Argentina; Des Moines, Iowa; Cepe May, New Jersey; Colby, Kansas; Salt L&ke City, Utah and Naha City, Okinawa motorists on the ground were having their share of UFO troubles also. UFOs took a greet deal of interest in frightening motorists by peeing autos and theiroccupants in North Carolina, England, Arkansas, Illinois, Kansas; California, lows, Florida, Wisconsin, Japan and Australia. One such pursuit resulted in a car wreck in Sherwood, Australia, on July 3- Such commonplace occurances number in the thousands worldwide over the past quarter-century and no end appears to be in sight* Ground observers in Poland, Germany, France and Switzerland made numerous cigar and saucer-shaped UFO sightings public for the first time. Larger objects (usually cigar-shaped) were seen releasing smaller objects (usually saucer-shaped) above Mel- ville, Australia; Tucson, Arizona; St. Louis, Missouri and C am p O s, Brazil in the month of July alone. Not at all unlike \"Project Apollo in Reverse\" for a compsrison. UFO OCCUPANTS were reported seen on the ground in Balls Ferry, California, on January 21 and their uniforms were reported to contain \"lump like pouches,\" while on July 19 at Kuraby, Queensland, Australia, six UFO pilots there during a UFO landing were described as having \"faceted coverings.\" The number of such reports in 1972 was the smallest number (by a wide margin) of such encounters reported over the years worldwide from a total of over 1,000 similiar observations related over the pest several hundred years. Because of the controversial nature of such encounters (these often seen) aspects of UFO happenings continue to be the least reported because of the known fear of ridicule* 15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Because case histories of UFO appearances show that at least one third of all UFO landings involve UFO occupants (alien as they may appear to be at first glance in every way) it appears that with the large number of UFO landings reported to date in 1972; that,some of the sighters are not telling the full story of their experiences with UFOs. Such silence on the part of the UFO observers is under- standable, and an important part of the growing global UFO prob- len, which includes Iron and Bamboo Curtain countries also.

Car motors, houselights. radios, horns, motors and power systems were stopped by UFOs in England, Kansas, Missouri, France, Austria and Canada. Cows were burned as were cars and several humans in UFO close approaches in Lerned, Kansas, and at Lake Claire, Canada, on Febru- ary 23 and on April 15.

The general concensus was that ET life probably exists and may well be trying to contact us by radio. No mention of UFOs, which is par for the course!

The Boeing was flying at 250 knots when the .incident occurred. The captain, his senior flight officer and the flight engineer also saw the object. \"The shape of the UFO was indistinct. It was a bright light which ground control assured us was rot o.mpnating from any aircraft they knew of. They also checked' with the South African Air Force and with other authoritj.es, but drew a negative reply,\" the captain said,' \"- .Captain Chandler said airline pilots often saw earth satellites in orbit and it was quite easy to distinguish between them and other aircraft. He spotted a fast-moving object on an earlier flight to Cape Town this week, and it swept across the sky from north to south but did not come anywhere near the plane. According to various sources, this object w?s brown and passed under the plane. Dozens of Johannesburg families saw an orange-colored, glowing object crossing the sky at tremendous speed this week.
