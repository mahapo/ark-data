Despite the high interest in — and high potential payoff of — abduction and crash/retrieval cases, they represent extremes (rather than the \"norm\") and no totally convincing evidence has emerged to warrant acceptance of either as fact. Both do demand continued close monitoring and investigation. CE-II cases, especially, constitute the core of the mystery. Supposed links of UFOs with Bigfoot, cattle mutilations, etc. remain to be proven, and uncritical assumption of such links does nothing to advance scientific UFOlogy.

SchueSsler Flying discs, spheres, and cigars have been reported nearly continu- ously for the past 35 years. However, during the past decade an ever- increasing number of triangular and diamond-shaped objects have been seen in the skies, adding a new dimension to the UFO mystery. During the 1980 Christmas holiday season, three people encountered a large, glowing, diamond-shaped object, hovering over a dark east Texas road. The injuries they suffered are now familiar to UFO investigators around the globe. Nevertheless, the object remains unidentified. (The Cash- Landrum radiation injury case - Ed.) A similar object was sighted near Cleveland, Texas, on May 22,1982. Jon McDonald, a deputy sheriff for Liberty County, was on routine patrol just a few miles from the location of the earlier incident when he observed two bright lights just over the top of the tall pine trees. Officer McDonald explained how stolen cars were being driven from Houston and abandoned in that dark wooded area. At 10:57 that night he was alone in his patrol car when his UFO encounter began. The surroundings were familiar. He was at the pipeline crossing on Gladstall Road, a favorite dumping spot for stolen cars. Because the pipeline is the only open area in the dense woods he checked to see that the area was closed to traffic by a heavy wire fence. To his left he could see the red blinking lights atop some towers; but just beyond the towers appeared two very bright white lights. The east Texas Piney Woods is still relatively unspoiled; covered with trees and dense undergrowth. The human population is sparse and the nights dark. An officer on patrol must know the location of homes, businesses, and other man-made items. When an unusual light is spotted the officer is immediately alert. Therefore, when GRAY COLOR RED LIGHT BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS ROUNDED CORNERS FLASHING RED LIGHT Cleveland, Texas, UFO; May 22,1982 Deputy McDonald saw the two lights just over the trees he immediately flashed his spotlight in their direction, he figured the lights were on a low flying airplane. Nevertheless, he got out of the car for a look around; but the lights sunk out of sight below the treetops. Soon the lights reappeared. He said \"They would just come up and go down. I mean, stairstep itself down and stairstep itself back up. I shined my spotlight on it and the lights went out.\" The officer was on one side of the pipeline and the object was on the other — about 500 yards away. At that point he could see red lights in a diamond formation, with one blinking red light in the center. Its flight path was from the northeast to the southwest, directly over the officer's head. He said it was about 1,000 feet in the air and closing rapidly. When the object went overhead he shined his spotlight on it. \"I could plainly see it,\" he said. \"It was in a diamond shape, y'know, all four corners were rounded; but it was in a diamond shape.\" He went on to describe the color as grayish; like a dirty galvanized steel — \"a dirty, dirty gray.\" And it was large. \"I'd say you could fit ten cars into the square it would form if it was placed on the ground.\" The night was warm and humid and the sky was partly cloudy; but the forest was very still. In fact, he didn't hear the normal sounds of the crickets and small animals. The object, too, was silent as it glided overhead. Officer McDonald switched off his spotlight and stood in the darkness as the huge diamond-shaped object moved on to the southwest. In a few seconds he heard a whine and the object just took off. That was all. When asked to describe the sound, he said \"it sounded like a, not a turbine, but it would have to be something nuclear powered.\" Fortunately, the officer had an interesting experience without ill effects. When he reported the experience to the dispatcher via the police radio, he was told to submit an official Offense Report. Officer McDonald gave his permission for this report to be made public; suggesting it might be helpful to others in future sighting situations.

Pre-registration reservations should be sent to MUFON of Southern California, P.O. Box 2723, Sepulveda, CA 91343, with checks made payable to \"MUFON of Southern California.\" Pre-registration for all sessions is $17.50. (For additional information, see'Director's Message, p. 20.) Based on the turnout in San Francisco, Calif., 4 years ago, an attendance of 1,000 or more is anticipated for this year's symposium; Pasadena is adjacent to Los Angeles which has long been a center of organized UFO investigation and research in support of the National- Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), and MUFON. Pictured here are Bill Hassel — physicist), symposium chairman, and other organizers, along with some of the speakers. Topics to be covered include Southern California UFO sightings, UFO propulsion, E-M effects on vehicles, pilot sightings, crash/retrieval reports, Government cover-up, cattle mutilations, and UFOs on the international scene; (Speakers and titles are included in the Director's Message.) A variety of displays and informal caucuses will round out the conference. We suggest you make your reservations now for what promises to be the outstanding U.S. UFO Conference of the year.

All we really have are a lot of complex, but ill-defined events out of which we can extract no numerical values of aything. Contemporary management science has provided a means of coping with such situations, which are typical of those faced by businessmen, executives, and bureaucrats, as opposed to the carefully controlled world studied by scientists in their clean rooms and laboratories. The methodology is known as Decision Analysis. In principle, Decision Analysis is just the application of probability theory. The mathematics involved is about 200 years old. Anybody can learn the basics, but most people never reach this level in their formal education, not even the heavily schooled lawyers and fine arts PhDs. Engineers and scientists use the theory all the time, usually in a highly developed special form such as least-squares regression. It is the stock- in-trade of all those social scientists who use numbers more than eloquence, no matter their ideological bent. This essay will not attempt the construction of a rigorous decision theory analysis of the UFO phenomenon. Instead, the methods of A. Conan Doyle, as demonstrated by his character Sherlock Holmes, will be applied. What this means is that a story will be created out of a sequence of vaguely related events. The story could then be tested for possible validity by Decision Analysis. There are good reasons why this will not be done here. The first is that the author, though an applied mathematician, is only familiar with decision theory, but not facile with it. This problem can be solved by obtaining expert consultants, if someone could find the money for their fees. The entire UFO phenomenon 6 should be subjected to such an analysis, which ought to be revised on a regular basis as more data accumulate. The hypothesis to be outlined here would not win the accolade of \"most likely\" from very many experts at the present time. If a comprehensive Decision Analysis were done, several very different stories might outrank the variations of The German Hypothesis. There are, however, some good reasons for doing the analysis at the essay level. For one thing, it has been done at least twice before. The first try was UFO's, Nazi Secref Weapon? Written and published by Canadian far rightists, the little book suffers from sloppy composition -and shoddy scholarship. There is no documenta- tion to speak of, except some reprinted newspaper clippings. Little distinction is made between hard fact and speculation. Despite its flaws, the publication does serve the purpose of raising some interesting questions. Some people would say \"frightening,\" which is always interesting. The second effort is in the form of a novel, Genesis. Almost too much of the peripheral UFO baggage is taken into this book. The central character of the story is a villian of such Olympian proportions as to dwarf any historical person or even hypothesized extraterr- estrials. He is an American named Wilson from the corn belt, far more versatile than Leonardo, who vastly excells Stalin at political intrigue and makes all other scientists seem insignificant. As a work of literature, Genesis is a \"pot boiler\" novel, but it is intended to present possible historical facts as a dramatization. A big improvement over UFO's, Nazi Secret Weapon? is that the author has documented his sources thoroughly. The message of the two works is much the same, though the audiences and purposes diverge widely. One is trying to cheer up discouraged racists and the other to warn overconfident liberals. (Now guess which does which.) Even if one is not in either of these groups, it would be wise to take the message to heart. The rest of this essay will construct a more plausible scenario based on the common theme of Genesis and UFO's, Nazi Secret Weapon? It will not be claimed that this is the current most likely explanation of the UFO phenomenon, even in the not too humble opinion of the author. However, this is a serious effort to construct a far more plausible story than the ones in either of these books, and one whose likelihood is not negligible by any means. Space Technology The UFO phenomenon to some people seems a violation of the laws of physics. Most, if not all, of the basic physics and mathematics for the NASA shuttle and Project Apollo date from the nineteenth century or earlier. It took two generations and more for the technology to catch up. As it is, the Shuttle is an unwieldy, Rube Goldberg combination of a reentry vehicle and an airplane, that pushes existing science and technology close to the breaking point. One might call it a triumph of technological machismo over Murphy (and his Law), now that we have seen it does indeed fly. In stark contrast, the typical UFO outperforms dirty, noisy shuttles and military interceptors effortlessly and even quietly. Shuttle and space colony enthusiasts hate UFOs so much that they simply refuse to recognize their existence. Most books on relativity tell about the curvature of space and time. But space and time are not merely curved, in some sense they are not real, as useful as they may be to most engineers. Space and time are not absolutes. Mathematics calls this being non-holonomic; the jargon of relativity (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Hypothesis, Continued says they are not invariants. Experiments have shown that if a number of (very, very accurate) clocks make round trips through different environments they will record different elapsed times. Things as common as elevations show this same mathematical property in the context of classical, Newtonian physics.' Very precise elevations must be corrected for gravity variations because the surfaces of equal potential (such as a still pond) are not exactly parallel or concentric. Space'and time are not just curved in the world of high speeds and strong gravity, they are even ill-defined. The theory of relativity provides the correction equations to make sense out of the numbers we read from our rulers and clocks under all conditions, whereas classical physics is good enough for our workaday world. If we are to explain UFOs in terms of physics we understand to some degree, it seems essential to assume they are capable of generating artificial gravity fields, much as we produce magnetism with electric currents. Here is where our science is fatally deficient. Einstein and many others have tried to come up with a unified field theory. The results have been very disappointing, to say the least. But a completely success- ful theory would, supposedly, tell us how to generate a gravitational field from an electric current or other form of energy. Presumably we could cancel out the earth's gravity and accelerate very quickly in any direction. Perhaps there would even be a way to convert mass to energy without the massive equipment and radiation hazards of our present nuclear power plants or fusion projects. The very high accelerations demonstrated by UFOs imply very strongly that the gravity force is being used. Only gravity could accelerate a vehicle and its contents, including passengers, without setting up the large force gradients that would tear them apart. Because all our familiar aircraft use Newton's second law and mechanical pressure (ultimately derived from microscopic electro- magnetic forces) to propel themselves and their cargoes, most people have // we are to explain UFOs in terms of physics we under- stand to some degree, it seems essential to assume they are capable of generating artificial gravity fields.... concluded incorrectly that UFOs violate our basic concepts of physics. Instead high accelerations prove that UFOs use gravity forces. One may hypothesize a fifth force, not now known to terrestrial physicists, but this does not solve the problems of how to generate or control the force and adds an unnecessary assumption. German Breakthrough? For The German Hypothesis to be tenable, it is virtually essential to assume that a team of German scientists devised a very successful unified field theory and probably in the time frame of 1933-1939. The German technical expertise was surely the world's best in that period, though other European nations and America were not far behind. We do know that gravitons (the particles that transfer gravitational energy and momentum) and photons (the particles that transfer electromagnetic energy and momentum) do interact. Einstein predicted the curvature of light by gravity and this has indeed been observed. Perhaps this interaction is enhanced by resonance of the frequencies of photons and gravitons and that makes gravity manipulation quite practical. Such a phenomenon would create havoc with the geometric elegance of relativity theory as currently conceived, but quantum mechanics has done that already on the atomic scale. There are no other physical processes where the behavior of electromagnetic radiation (i.e., photons) does not depend critically on frequency. Some may object that the Nazis deprecated Einstein and his work and would be the last ones to expand upon it. Here we must differentiate between political rhetoric and technical expedience. For one thing, the media had built up Einstein as a folk hero, a brilliant, but eccentric, lovable man who wanted peace and just enough material goods to sustain his quest for scientific truth. He became a symbol of protest against the Nazi treatment of Jews. If indeed relativity and a unified field theory have the practical military and economic values of leading to UFO technology, it would make the most sense from the viewpoint of counterintelligence to denounce them as \"Jewish physics.\" To publicize such a possibility might have jarred Einstein's mind into action again. After he was about 40, in 1919, he never accomplished very much. And there also were (and are) many very bright younger physicists, to whom Nazism was an anathema, and they would have been strongly motivated to work on the • problems. Confusing the issue with personal attacks on Einstein and his racial and religious background was a good strategy and it dovetailed so perfectly with NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party) ideology that it would arouse no suspicion. One may ask how German physicists could make such a breakthrough without it being duplicated in the past 50 years or so. Frequently scientific discoveries are made almost simultaneously, but not always. In Marco Polo's time China was the equal of Europe in everything where it did not surpass the West. By the nineteenth century China had regressed while the West had made enormous progress in the sciences and technology. Recent successes of Chinese scientists show us that bright, creative people were still being born in China, but that the society had become so ossified that it stultified them. Opportunities in other areas of science and the awesome Einstein personality cult have served to deter people from following his leads or questioning his hypotheses, as a photon-graviton resonance would require. What is more, graduate and professional schools tend to drive out creative people in favor of mediocre workaholics, who are better at memori- -zing trivia than thinking. Creative people are likely to be eccentric, undisciplined, (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Hypothesis, Continued and lopsided in their intellectual development, as was Einstein, himself. Nazi sympathizers, on the other hand, would have been strongly stimulated to debunk Einstein and would go over his work with a fine-tooth comb, if they had adequate capabilities. In the process they could well have succeeded in extending and improving his work rather than totally discrediting it. If they could get that far, the military implications would be obvious. Genesis suggests a conventional technological model for flying discs, though it mentions anti-gravity as a possible propulsion method. One may wonder if Hitler ever was aware of the flying disc project. The existence of such an effort is well documented in Genesis and less so in UFO's, Nazi Secret Weapon. The crux of The German Hypothesis lies in whether the disc was a genuine UFO type of craft or we have a case of an historical coincidence of UFOs appearing while Germans are working on a totally crackpot aircraft design. The existence of \"foo fighters\"suggests that the German disc may have been viable. Genesis postulates that der Fuhrer was ignorant of the whole process, which was carried out under Himmler's aegis. Another viewpoint suggests taking Nazi ideology seriously and discounting Nazi rhetoric. The NSDAP lauded the Nordic subrace and was down on slavs and hostile to Jews. Anthropologist Carlton Coon has shown that most of the population of Germany is of the Alpine subrace. Earlier studies have indicated a very strong correlation of Nordic with Protestant and Alpine with Catholic. Nazi propaganda insisted the non-Jewish Germans were \"pure Nordic,\" but the party experts hardly could have believed it themselves. The majority of Germans were (and are) . basically Alpine, much like the despised Czechs, Poles, and Russians. Not only were the Alpine types a majority, but they .were the grass roots support of the NSDAP. Nazism also was very unpopular in the Nordic foreign nations of Scandinavia, the British Isles, and North America. Hitler himself was an Austrian. Despite an 8 endless wave of anti-Nazi books and TV programs, this glaring contradiction is never mentioned. Lack of consistency, however, is scarcely a vice unique to Nazi politicians. We Americans always have been told Hitler wanted to conquer the world. That seems to be a typical exaggeration, but he did state explicitly he wanted Germany to become a powerful imperialist state, a position from which Britain was slipping at that time. All Germans then, no matter their political persuasion, were saturated with history and aware of Oswald Spengler and his ideas. Another fact is that the Nordics were (and are) becoming a smaller and smaller minority in Germany. They were the losers in a demographic derby, as are their WASP cousins in contemporary America, whites in South Africa, and Jews in Israel. An expanded, imperialistic Reich would have accelerated this process, we can be sure. So, what's another little contradiction? We do know the Nazis took their racial theories seriously enough to set up special facilities to produce ideal human specimens through selective breeding. As students of the Aryan conquest of India, they must have known that caste systems ultimately fail. The best wgy to produce a true super race, instead of the imaginary one of political propaganda, would be in relative isolation, pot in the middle of an imperialistic state, where commerce and political intrigue soon submerge class, caste, society, and culture. A victorious Third Reich undoubtedly would have set up for its chosen a special colony isolated from the turmoil of central Europe, but the long-term viability of such a Utopia is dubious as long as it is a dependency. The new disc technology, however, with its ability to bore wormholes in space and time, opened up vast new possibilities. Why not take the best and leave both Germany and its enemies behind? Now I suspect that most German Nordics, like their kin elsewhere, were appalled at Hitler, Nazism, and all else that is illiberal and anti-intellectual. There must have been, however, a minority of fanatical supporters among this minority. At least some of these would be moved to the Antarctic and the Amazon region and then, perhaps, to a colony on a planet revolving about some convenient star. If one can conceive that this might have happened, and that is asking for a very open, imaginative mind, then speculation about Hitler's role is now appropriate. We have been so saturated with propaganda about Hitler's crimes against humanity that .we fail to notice some real peculiarities about his career. His rise to power and success was meteoric and reached a peak in 1939. Then he wrecklessly launched his country into a hopeless war and it and much of the rest of Europe were devastated. It is too easy to say that Hitler was crazy. Such statements explain anything and hence explain nothing. A more realistic evaluation is that age and stress caught up with his frail, war-damaged constitution and his physical and mental health deteriorated. But why did he allow the war to start in 1939? Germany's submarine fleet, its only answer to Britain's and America's powerful navies, was obsolete even then and the V2's, missiles, and jet fighters on the drawing boards were years from production. Germany would have needed vast technical superiority to hope to match the far more massive productive capacities and manpower pools of France, Britain, the U.S.A., and the U.S.S.R, Her allies were Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria, all of little value. Not only did Hitler start a massive war ill- prepared, he mismanged it so badly that some of his generals tried to assassinate him in 1944. Near the end of the war, for example, he made the Luftwaffe use the new Me-262 jet fighter as a fighter-bomber instead of a much needed superior interceptor. Not only did he not want to win the war, he did not want to delay defeat. One can speculate that Hitler escaped with his hypothesized chosen few or stayed behind to assure that he program remained a secret and that Germany was thoroughly demolished. Would he abandon his faithful supporters, and maximize Itheir defeat, (continued on"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Hypothesis, Continued to pursue an ideologial dream? Although a skilled politician, Hitler was certainly a \"true believer.\" He was an ascetic, like Gandhi, not the type of high-living grafter that fills our elected offices. Could he cynically leave his devoted Alpine followers to the tender mercies of the Soviet Army? Certainly! As a fanatic he would have put aside every consideration except the success of his ultimate project. The situation in Europe would keep the world distracted for years while the New Man in the New Germany was busy at other things. After Germany was defeated, everybody tried to outdo his neighbor blaming it all on their former leader. The hypothesized cynicism would have been well justified. According to both Genesis and UFO's..., the escape to the South Pole did not go undetected. Did Admiral Byrd probe for Nazi exiles down there, who retaliated with a show of force over Washington, D.C.?This is too specific a series of events to analyze without intensive research, some of which might require classified or otherwise unavailable materials. Instead, let us analyze some typical UFO behavior patterns that indicate a terrestrial source with a critical edge in science, rather than an extraterrestrial civilization hundreds or even thousands of years more advanced than we are. For one thing, UFOs take keen interest in secret military bases. This has been reported repeatedly. A society so very far ahead would be content to read Jayne's annuals about our destructive toys. UFO encounters are always incredibly bizzare. A highly advanced alien culture would be cool, rational, and detached, even if somewhat curious, and could avoid detection completely. The apparently exotic behavior seems to be intended to keep the scientific community and the bourgeoisie (including Soviet apparatchiks) blissfully incredulous. The cheapest and most effective part of any security system is a flow of information that is high in volume and low in coherence. Whatever the source of UFOs, they are doing an excellent job of this. The mission of the UFOs The cheapest and most effective part of any security system is a flow of information that is high in volume and low in coherence. Whatever the source of UFOs, they are doing an excellent job of this. obviously is spying, and perhaps even some piracy. Human abductions and cattle mutilations indicate they may be into molecular biology and are somewhat ahead of us, as Genesis suggests. Best Estimate On this side of the fence what is happening? The best estimate is that the intelligence community is keeping it all a secret from elected officials and that no President or Congressman has been able to learn more than you have. There are two motivations for this kind of behavior and it's not clear which is dominant in this case. The inner core of the intelligence community may harbor Nazi sympathizers, who would not like to see the noble experiment disturbed. There also is bound to be a strong fear of retaliation if a threat were to develop. Underground research and security facilities have been built by the U.S.A., much as Germany did during the Third Reich. That is where the UFO action must be, if there is any within the U.S. Government. A massive retaliation of unknown proportions might accompany the launching of a conspicuous American program to duplicate UFO technology. The UFOs are not as easy to spy on as the Soviet Union, so the intelligence community keeps walking on eggs. For the same reasons the \"spooks\" must cooperate, willingly or not, with the UFO effort to remain incredible. If elected officials and most of the upper- middle class became convinced of the reality and hence importance of the UFO phenomenon, the debate would move out of the shadows and into the limelight of the democratic process. The results of this are totally unpredictable to the \"spooks,\" to the UFOs, and to your author. Fortunately, even if a politician or scientist reads.this article, he (or she) won't take it seriously. These people, though not really stupid, are as stubborn as the proverbial mule; you have to hit them between the eyes with a sledge hammer to get their attention. The German Hypothesis indicates that World War II was started, expanded, and deliberately lost to distract the attention of the majority of the human race .from the true directions of National Socialist scientific and social programs. This strategy would permit the Nazi colony to expand its technical lead tremendously, while the vastly wealthier U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. would waste their time and money on dead- ends such as chemical rocketry. Lots of speculations can be made about certain details of the UFO experience. UFO's, .Nazi Secret Weapon?, in fact, makes the (undocumented) statement that these German exiles have contacted extraterrestrials and are collaborating with them. Genesis speculates that the apparent aliens are short Paraguayan Indians, captured and robotized by brain implants. Either or both of these speculations might be true. Now that you have swallowed The German Hypothesis hook, line, and sinker, we may proceed to predict future developments. UFOs will continue to monitor earth very carefully. Even if interstellar travel has opened up vast, new frontiers, it will be a long time before the colony has grown enough to feel secure from a potentially hostile home planet. Would the colony ever invade Earth? If inhabitable planets are as rare as some scientists think, it is a distinct possibility. Or most inhabitable planets may already have formidable societies. Provided that living space is still not too scarce in the Universe, the colony may be content to let us proceed on our path of wiping out most life on Earth, and ultimately ourselves, with environmental destruction and perhaps nuclear war. We can be sure any UFOnauts have read The Global 2000 Report to the President, even if Ronald Reagan has not. We may be left as a bad example of the results of democracy and egalitarianism to instruct future generations in their evils.

Nelson Bob Wanderer stated in a letter after reviewing my \"Viewpoint on the Andreasson Affair\" that our positions seem .fairly close and that we both are dubious of that case. I am only \"partly dubious,\" mainly because of the use of hypnosis to obtain the story. Actually I am very open to the whole thing, including the fact there may have been a real UFO and real entities involved. Maybe this is because, as I've become acquainted with the UFO phenomenon the past 10-15 years, I believe that real UFO events occur. I think he by contrast, believes real UFO events do not occur — which makes him a \"skeptic\" and me a \"believer.\" I would wear my believer's badge with honor even though the NOVA show used the term in a derogatory sense. The term does not mean that I'm a weak-minded dupe. It is the very contradictory and anomalous nature of the UFO phenomenon that drives me to study and consider the nature of reality itself. And I would be the last to try to tell others what the whole thing is all about or how they should think about it. That would be presumptuous and egotistical. As for the article on the NOVA \"The Case of the UFOs\" (No. 178, Dec. 1982), Wanderer's position is that the show which the UFO movement would like to see made cannot be made because the standards of TV documentaries are such that it wouldn't be considered since it would not be sufficiently focussed and easily understood. To that my. response is a loud \"Bull--, Mr. Wanderer!\" The producers may have had that thought Hypothesis, Continued Even if you consider The German Hypothesis an outgrowth of an historical accident, some of the deductions of this essay remain highly plausible. The nature of the game being played by the UFOs and the intelligence community with each other and with the general public has only one explanation. Even advanced aliens might be concerned if the U.S.A. or U.S.S.R. developed UFO capabilities. Obviously the \"spooks\" know a lot about UFOs and do not want any part of it to feed into the political process, for the reasons given previously. It is more than a concern that stock in North American Rockwell would plummet because the firm's technology is potentially obsolete. Only an addled socialist ideologue would come up with an explanation like that. Unless there is a fluke event, where both UFOs and \"spooks\" lose control for too long, civilian researchers will continue to be stymied by lack of resources. There has been no UFO activity escalation sufficient to perturb the smugness of the scientific community or the middle class as a whole. Let's recall the mule analogy. So 10 far we have been tantalized with feathers. Freedom of Information suits are not going to dislodge anything significant unless they happen to trigger the unlikely event. A Federal judge, and some rather flaky people now hold these jobs, might freak out and spill it all. As a UFO investigator, you are increasing the likelihood of the fluke. Do you want to open up a Pandora's Box out of which may flow aliens, economic and social upheaval, and perhaps even revenge-minded Nazis? If you are a UFO investigator, you have more curiosity and imagination than good sense. And if I can pop the lid before you, I will.

Dr. J. Allen Hynek's editorial in International UFO Reporter (Nov.- Dec., 1982) outlines the many feet of film that ended up on the cutting room floor, which could have gone to make the show that Wanderer says couldn't be made. The editorial also discredits the Persinger \"explanation\" for such UFO events as Travis Walton's or Deputy Val Johnson's — a theory I introduced to Mr. Wanderer in order to give him something to chew on, to see how he would behave. My own additional objection to the NOVA show is only a logical one. It concerns the scene showing the compressive rock fracture experiments. The electric sparks appeared during the rock fracture. \"Real\" UFOs are not seen at the . same time . as an earthquake, although there are known to be large diffuse earthquake lights sometimes associated. Harley Rutledge's letter to APRO (APRO Bulletin V. 30, No. 11) agrees. He says, \"Having lived in the vicinity of the New Madrid fault for 20 years and having directed a long-term scientific field study of UFO phenomena, during which I observed some 150 UFO lights, I do not believe that any of these were produced by insects or earthquakes — nor~ were any of the seven craft I observed.\" It's an interesting theory, but the NOVA show stated rock fracture as the source of UFO lights. That is not even what Persinger is saying. He points to a six-month or longer lag that he thinks occurs in his hypothetical UFO connection between earth stress and eventual earthquake. His mathematical analyses are based on a lag. I'll bet I'd be able to prove anything about anything if I were up on my multivariant statistical analyses.

A personal appearance by Scott Carpenter, the former astronaut and the display of a 12-foot model of the Space Shuttle preceded MUFON's exhibit by 2 weeks. Continuous visual aids were an attraction to visitors to the shopping mall and our exhibit. In addition to the four display boards (both sides) exhibiting 8 x 10 inch photographs and drawings of close encounter cases of the first, second, and third kinds, one board was devoted to hoax photos.Jens flares, and objects frequently misinterpreted as UFOs. The most popular attraction was the continuous showing of UFO programs, movies, and documentaries on a closed circuit VHS video display, provided through the courtesy of Video Concepts. Some of the VHS tapes featured were \"UFOs Are Real,\" \"The UFO Experience\" by KPIX-TV in San Francisco, \"Chariots of the Gods,\" \"The UFO Incident,\" and the question- able NOVA series, \"The Case of the UFO.\" Between videotape shows, slides of UFO photographs were projected on a screen depicting close Comment, Continued electrical events, I have no comment. Now that Wanderer has made a commitment to the \"pine long\" solution to the great Loch Ness Monster mystery ( No. 176, Oct. 1982), I wonder what he thinks about the 1,500 hours of sonar-grams with multiple contacts made by the latest study, reviewed in a recent New Scienfisf (\"The Biology of Loch Ness,\" Vol. 97, No. 1345,17 Feb. 1983)? Apparently the scientists are not ready to close the books on it as soon as he is. encounters of the first, second, and third kinds. The public exhibit also provided the first occasion to display MUFON's new 4 ft. x 6 ft. banner. Made of wool felt, it has white letters and logo on a royal blue background with gold border and accessories. This banner will be used at all annual MUFON UFO Symposiums, starting with Pasadena, California, as a prominent backdrop behind the speakers lectern. Since favorable UFO public education is one of MUFON's objectives, photographs have been included ' in this article showing construction details of the display boards and exhibit layout as ideas for our members who may wish to utilize them. MUFON is personally indebted to Sherman J. Larsen and the Center for UFO Studies for their novel construction ideas to build individual boards that are not only portable for transportation, but selfrstanding and may be assembled in 5 minutes after the photographs have been attached. Our display consists of six boards (both sides), however only four were used in Corpus Christi. It may be extended to any number of boards without any revision in design.' Aluminum tubing for legs and extruded aluminum channeling provides the frame and strength for each board. Angle brackets are used for the corners to attach each board to the upright legs with appropriate auto hose clamps. One-half inch thick celotex, 3 ft. x 4 ft. in size, and painted white on both sides was used for the basic boards. The time for construction is no small task, considering the number of extruded aluminum channels that must be cut and fitted, and the drilling and insertion of 240 self tapping screws in the bracketry for six boards. Plans are being made to have both the UFO exhibit display boards and the beautiful MUFON banner at the 1984 MUFON UFO Symposium in Dallas, Texas. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CRITIC'S CORNER By Robert Wanderer How to Avoid Being \"Abducted\" Are you concerned that you and your loved ones might be \"abducted\" onto a UFO by \"aliens\"? A fascinating new study suggests a simple way to avoid such a calamity: If you do not believe \"abduction\" is possible, you will not be \"abducted.\" At least that's the interpretation I make, adapting the results of a study of \"past lives\" hypnosis to the problem of UFO \"abduction\" stories. I consider that \"abduction\" stories and \"past lives\" stories involve essentially the same procedure: you are hypnotized, asked (explicitly or implicitly) to tell a story (about being \"abducted\" or about a \"past life\"), and then your \"unconscious mind\" (or whatever term *> ' you prefer) produces the requested story. The study was conducted by Robert A. Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky. He recruited 60 students who had been hypnotized in classroom exercises and were considered good hypnosis subjects. Each person came individually into a room containing a comfortable cot and was told they were participating in a study or relaxation, where they were to lie down and listen to a tape recording on \"past lives regression.\" Three slightly different recordings were used, each with 20 students. After hearing the tape the subject was hypnotized and regressed into a \"time machine\" going back down through the years before birth. They were asked to describe themselves and their surroundings there. After intensive questioning, each subject was returned to the \"time machine\" for a second and then a third attempted excursion into the past. One group heard a tape telling about a \"new and exciting\" therapy using \"past lives,\" and suggesting that the subject \"relax, let go, and do as I tell you\" to journey back to another life. Of these 20 subjects, 17 reported on a \"past life,\" and 15 of those reported more than one \"past life\" in the three 12 attempts. Only three didn't come up with a \"past life.\" The second group heard a more neutral tape about \"past .lives,\" saying that \"you may or may not drift back to another lifetime.\" Of these 20 subjects, 12 reported on a \"past life\" and nine of those on more than one. Eight of the 20 reported none. The third group heard a tape about \"a bunch of far-out therapists on the West Coast have come up with yet another crazy kind of therapy\" and advising the subject that \"you might accidentally, by chance,\" experience another lifetime. Of those 20, only two reported a \"past life,\" only one reported more than one, and 18 had none. Baker concludes that \"it seems clear that the suggestions made prior to the induction and regression attempts had a significant influence upon the past-life reports.\" I suspect something very similar goes on in \"abduction\" cases developed under hypnosis. You report some \"missing time,\" some time you can't account for. You wonder whether something strange happened, you've heard that people sometimes report UFO \"abductions\" in such circumstances, and you go under hypnosis wondering/expecting/believ- ing in some mysterious unknown. And then, the story you \"expected\" comes out under hypnosis. As Dr. Baker concludes: \"Past lives regression phenomena, rather than being examples of the 'reality' of reincarnation, are instead the result of suggestions made by the hypnotist, expectations held by the subjects, and the demand characteris- tics of the hypnoidal relationship.\" Replace \"past lives regression\" with \"UFO abduction,\" and \"reincarna- tion\" with \"extra-terrestrial aliens,\" and you've got a provocative thesis about UFO \"abduction\" stories. It would be interesting if someone would test that thesis, similar to the study of \"past lives\" hypnosis. We hear of cases where people are hypnotized, allegedly to find out what \"really\" happened on some occasion, and suspecting that \"something strange\" may have happened. It sometimes turns out that they think they were \"abducted\" onto a UFO. Are there ever any cases where people are hypnotized expecting to have some exotic story revealed such as a UFO \"abduction,\" where they tell under hypnosis that they weren't \"abducted\" but actually had a perfectly normal experience? Are there hypnotized subjects with such expectations who do not get what they expect? Dr. Baker, in the article reporting on his study, cited other cases going back to Bridey Murphy in 1956 which show \"how easily human subjects will role play extreme regressions on demand.\" In all these studies, he points out, \"the power of suggestion seems paramount. If a hypnotic subject is told he will go back to another lifetime and if the hypnotist expects him to do so and demands that he play such a role, it is difficult for the subject not to comply.\" Hypnotists in \"abudction\" cases, please note.

However, I was encouraged to see that he was unable to point out any specific errors in what I said. I do occasionally make errors when I speak, as do most of us mortals, but either I made none on that day, or if I did, Mr. Staff did not find them. Mr. Staff starts right off on the wrong foot by spelling my name wrong, which MUFON's editors apparently did not bother to check. He then claims that I was host to the Jim Eason Show »that afternoon, which is incorrect. Mr. Eason hosted the show that day, as is his custom; I was the guest. Furthermore, I am astonished to see that Mr. Staff would say that \"until recently, there has been a paucity of data for evaluating the work of Mr. Scheaffer (sic).\" My book The UFO Verdict has now been available for two years. It has been' reviewed right here in the MUFON UFO Journal. (\"Offensive and inexcusable\": McCampbell; \"An insult to the intelligence\": Andrus.) Tsk, tsk. I've fared far better, however, in reviews in real scientific publications such as The New Scientist and Sky and Telescope, where my book was recommended highly). I was an invited speaker at the 1980 Smithsonian UFO Symposium in Washington, , D.C., which received much attention nationally. In addition, my writings have been published in magazines such as Omni, Astronomy, Official UFO, Frontiers of Science, Fate, and others, and have been discussed in practically every major UFO publication. I cannot imagine where Mr. Staff has been these past few years. In fact, I see no statement attributed to me which I would care to deny, or change even if I could. The Jimmy Carter UFO was undoubtedly Venus, whether Mr. Staff likes it or not. Anyone who insists in taking 14 unsubstantiated eyewitness impress- ions as \"gospel,\" instead of what they are (impressions) has obviously learned nothing from the last 35 years of UFOlogy. And yes, it sometimes is necessary to interrupt long-winded story tellers on radio shows, because the actual time available on such shows (minus commercials, news, etc.) is in fact extremely limited. When someone is telling you about a sighting which occurred 30 years ago, and can't even say what date it occurred, and .I have no star tables, weather records, airline schedules, etc., in front of me, the chances of making any intelligent evaluation of that incident in the next minute or two are nil. Everyone's time would be better spent by going on to the next call. While •Mr. Staff apparently doesn't realize the necessity for a great deal of specific information before evaluating a UFO sighting (he says it makes no difference whether or not the-date is known!!!), I would hope that MUFON does. Robert Sheaffer San Jose, Calif. (Editor's comment: Why does Mr. Sheaffer think that an \"instant evaluation\" is what is expected of him on a radio show? Is it not more important to try to determine from the caller's \"impressions\" whether a simple, natural explanation is applicable, and if not, to work backward from that point and try to pin down an exact date so that real investigation — as opposed to skeptical assumption — can be undertaken?) Reviewer Response To Author Editor, Harley Rutledge (No. 179, Jan. 1983) has made two allegations about my negative review of his book. Both are totally invalid. First, he stated that I was \"befuddled\" about there being no radar capabilities to deal with over Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Sorry, Harley, but you should have checked with the Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Center across the state border. They did have radar coverage of non- transponding targets over your home town down to 6,000 feet, even back in 1973. Recent additions to the system have improved that figure by another thousand feet. The FAA also could have contacted those targets representing light aircraft by radio. Rutledge didn't pursue this prospect; he merely wondered how many of his 158 UFOs could have been aircraft lights! Second, he claims that I have \"persisted\" in \"persuading\" a heavily- referenced member of his field team to . \"impugn\" him. I met the latter in Atlanta by accident, where he initially offered unsolicited doubts about the emotional atmosphere affecting many of his experiences with Rutledge in the field. Once he learned I was planning to do a review of Project Identification, he backed off, not wanting to hurt his friendship with Rutledge. Thus, I published nothing in Fate about our conversation! Of what \"antics\" am I guilty? I stand by my pan of Project Identification. The book promised a \"first scientific .field study\" with extensive use of instrumentation and the insights of a PhD physicist. Instead, the reader got an amateurish \"skywatch\" with a startling lack of field equipment use, no photographs of the 41 \"Class A\" UFOs, subjective estimates. in place of systematic triangulatibn and assumptions about the intelligence of a UFO phenomenon personally attuned to one Harley Rutledge. Allan Hendry Tucson, Ariz. \"Space Aliens\" Talk Editor, In reference to Mr. Lucius Parish' statement (No. 179, Jan. 1983) referring to the Dec. 14th issue of the National Enquirer, about the \"nutty possibilities\" of space aliens talking through hypnotized clients and the endorsement, I wonder what basis he has for his statement. Seemingly, to my knowledge; he has witnessed none of these hypnotic sessions nor reviewed some 50 hours of video and also 50 hours of casette. Although I know this seems a \"way out\" form of communication, I (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Letters, Continued cannot help but remembering a reproduction of an article that was in the New York times way back when the telephone was invented. The New York Times was calling Alexander Graham Bell \"nutty.\" The article went something like this: \"There is a man by the name of Alexander Graham Bell who is trying to take the American public on the 'nutty' idea of being able to talk over a wire. Anybody in their right mind would know this was an impossibility. But if it were so, what earthly use would it be?\" Jiles Hamilton Daytona Beach, Fla. (Editor's Comment: Mr. Hamilton enclosed newspaper clippings identifying himself as a \"licensed hypnotist\" in Florida who accidentally stumbled across alleged \"alien communications\" through routine hypnosis performed on people with personal problems. The \"aliens voices\" allegedly used the voice boxes of his subjects to communicate information. People knowledgeable about \"trance states\" and \"multiple personalities\" are invited to comment.) Journalistic Standards Editor, A basic difference between Bill Moore's journalism and mine has indeed been identified in his response (No. 178, Dec. 1982) to my article. My feeling is that the selection and uncritical repetition of secondary sources does indeed constitute endorsement and I believe both journalistic ethics and legal standards are closer to that view (that's one reason Moore is being sued by at least one person about whom he merely repeated some offensive nonsense.) I believe to claim otherwise is to abdicate an author's responsibility to verify the accuracy of his material — but of course one does have to trust other people, yet when that trust is shown to have been misplaced (as in Moore's case), one should take one's lumps like a man. Paraphrasing Moore's attitude as expressed in correspondence with me, he claims that merely repeating a story in his published works does not imply that he thinks the story is necessarily true, or that he expects his readers to believe he is attesting to the accuracy of the story in question. I do not think that's cricket. I am flattered that Moore admits my research has \"consistently demonstrated an access to information (in many cases Soviet) which is not generally available to the rest of us.\" That is what most reviewers wrote about my book Red Star in 'Orbit (Random House, 1981), although THEY meant it as a compliment. I would modestly attribute that not to any inside information or surreptitious guidance, but to uncommon diligence and resourcefulness. Yet Moore's point about footnotes and sources is well taken. The main source of my information has been Charles Sheldon's Soviet Space . Programs and the issues of Spqceflight magazine (published by the British Interplanetary Society in London). I certainly do aver that I have had access to no classified data or analyses — my work is totally original and I'm damned proud of it. Regarding the dispute over CUFOS's alleged violation of Soviet copyright on the \"Gindilis Report\" re- publication: I am entirely accurate on that count. The USSR signed the International Copyright Convention in 1973, routinely violates it internally, but keeps a stringent eye on Western transgressions (although it has, admittedly, never sued anyone so far). There is a loophole, sanctioned by tradition, in which government official internal use of translations is tolerated so long as no commercial value accrues to the material (the National Technical Information Service, or NTIS, is authorized to sell certain translations but the Soviet government receives its cut). Publishing the Gindilis Report for sale is clearly illegal; what I wrote is entirely true. Perhaps Moore's off-base accusation is just \"yet another example of [his] well-known penchant for making pronouncements from on high without bothering to first check his facts\" (the words he ironically used to describe my own statements!). For verification, check with the Department of Commerce, Mr. Eugene Pawlikowsky, (202) 377-1362. James Oberg Dickinson, Texas N.Z. Radar Case Reference Bruce S. Maccabee's \"open-letter\" (No. 178, Dec. 1982) relative to statements made by me on the NOVA UFO program, he is correct that it was 7 minutes after Capt. William Startup first asked the Wellington center about unidentified radar blips before he mentioned having a TV crew on board, as I promptly acknowledged to Maccabee on Oct. 23, 1982.1 regret that age is taking its toll of my memory cells. But -the facts are, as Maccabee knows, that traffic controller Geoff Causer did not call the pilot (Startup) to warn him of unknown radar-blips in the vicinity of Startup's aircraft until the pilot chanced to ask. As the controller explained to Maccabee in a telephone conversation on Jan. 14, 1979, barely two weeks after the incident, he had been informed by the man he replaced that Startup had a TV crew on board. Further, that he had been monitoring the disappearing-reappearing blips because he \"was expecting him (Startup) to ask me.\" Then the controller laughed. When Maccabee asked if the controller had ever before seen such oddly behaving blips, Causer, informed Maccabee: \"Yes I have. I think if you'd check with most of the radar controllers at Wellington, we've all seen anomalous propagation, or unidentified returns from time to time. We haven't taken too much notice of them. It was only because of the interest shown by this particular flight and by the previous sightings on the 21st of December, you know. There was a lot of interest shown.\" The controller also told Maccabee: \"The thing with all these (radar) targets, with the exception of one I spotted later in the evening, they were erratic. You couldn't track them in the accepted sense. They showed no afterglow.\" (When monitoring craft-like objects, the last position appears brightest, with (continued on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Letters, Continued each successively previous position appearing less bright.) As Capt. Startup himself reported in his own book (p. 98): \"Geoff (Causer) had been watching the curious radar images down the coast for almost half an hour. They were erratic, though, appearing and disappearing in random fashion, and he did not consider them to be solid objects. \"(Emphasis added.) Inasmuch as Startup at no time changed course to try to avoid a possible mid-air collision with the blips reported to him, I must conclude that he shared controller Causer's opinion. Although Maccabee has published numerous papers and articles on the New Zealand case, including several in the MUFON UFO Journal, he has not revealed what the controller told him on Jan. 14,1979, which would indicate that the Wellington radar blips were caused either by anomalous propagation conditions, a malfunction of the radar's moving target indicator, or a combination of both. Perhaps this key omission indicates that advancing years are taking a toll of Maccabee's memory cells as well as my own. Philip J. Klass Washington, D.C. Cash-Landrum Radiation Editor, As one who is actively studying the Cash-Landrum case, and who has corresponded with Dr. Peter Rank on numerous occasions, I must express my amusement at Paul Stowe's \"Technical Review of Radiation Evidence in Cash-Landrum Case\" and Dr. Rank's response. (No. 178, Dec. 1982). Dr. Rank begins his review of the article by congratulating Mr. Stowe for \"the depth of his knowledge and the thoroughness of his analysis....! would agree totally with Mr. Stowe's analysis...\" He then proceeds to reject many of Stowe's assumptions and conclusions: (1) Regarding assumption of total body exposure, \"This is by no means clear.\" (2) Regarding Stowe's estimate of 200-300 rem exposure, \"I do not believe 16 Joe Santangelo, Director of MUFON Amateur Radio Nets and Eastern Regional Director of MUFON. For information about the nets, contact Mr. Santangelo at 20 Boyce St., Reading, MA 01867. that a general dosage level can be assigned...\" (3) Regarding assumption of monoenergetic source, \"It is therefore misleading to assume that monoenergetic rays of any kind are the principal determinant of the patients' symptoms.\" Dr. Rank reveals that \"there were no well-documented changes in the blood...\" According to Table 1, which accompanied Stowe's article, this would indicate total body exposure of less than approximately 50 rem, insufficient to account for the reported diarrhea, vomiting, hair loss, and non- healing ulcer. However, if the witnesses managed to ingest additional radiation, and apply still more to their hair (while somehow avoiding total body exposure), perhaps this case would make some sense. As it now stands, there appears to be no rational support for the speculation that Cash-Landrum represents a genuine radiation exposure case, much less a \"UFO\" case. I would strongly urge MUFON to encourage the witnesses to take a properly administered polygraph • examination (perhaps on F. Lee Bailey's television program \"Lie Detector\"), to assist those of us who are searching for the truth in this case. Gary P. Posner, M.D. St. Petersburg, Fla.
