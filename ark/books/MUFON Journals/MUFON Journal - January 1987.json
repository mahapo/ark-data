Strange Encounter Over Alaska Was an FAA-confirmed sighting really a UFO? I t was big—bigger than anything known to fly, according to an experienced pilot who watched it from as little as eight miles off. It was fast—fast enough to keep pace with a 747 jet for half an hour as it flew over the empty Alaska wilderness. It was flanked by .two smaller objects that maneu- vered with it; together the three objects flashed a brilliant pattern of yellow, amber and green lights. And—if this sounds aw- fully familiar to connoisseurs of UFO tales—there is one thing that set this par- ticular apparition apart: it may have shown up on radar. Although the Federal Aviation Adminis- tration confirmed last week that some sort of sighting did take place aboard Japan Air Lines Flight 1628, much of what happened remains a mystery. The incident began on the evening of Nov. 17, with veteran pilot Kenjyu Terauchi, 47, at the controls of the JAL cargo plane, which was en route to Anchorage from Reykjavik, Iceland, the middle leg of a Europe-to-Tokyo flight. The weather was clear as the jet crossed the Beaufort Sea off Alaska's north coast. Sud- denly Terauchi and his two fellow crew- men spotted flashing lights moving along- side them—about eight miles off, at the plane's altitude of 35,000 feet. Terauchi radioed FAA controllers and received per- mission to descend to 31,000 feet. After a minute the controllers asked if the lights were still there. \"It is descending in forma- tion,\" the pilot replied. Terauchi said he glimpsed the full craft only once, in profile. \"It was a very big one—two times bigger than an aircraft car- rier,\" he reported. He sketched it as wal- nut-shaped, with a wide flat rim and bulges above and below. According to FAA spokes- man Paul Steucke of the Anchorage re- gional office, Terauchi located the object with his own on-board weather radar. Both . Air Force and civilian flight controllers reported briefly seeing echoes of what might have been another craft nearby the JAL flight. But when radar tapes covering the period were replayed by FAA investiga- tors, Steucke says, the reported echoes could not be found. The Air Force, he add- ed, is now attributing the supposed radar sightings to \"clutter.\" 'A mystery': Approaching Fairbanks, Ter- auchi steered his plane in a 360-degree cir- cle, but the object stayed with him, finally disappearing as the 747 approached An- chorage. FAA officials interviewed the crew on the ground and found them, in Steucke's words, \"professional, rational, well-trained people.\" The FAA confirmed the incident after inquiries from Japanese reporters, who heard about it from a rela- tive of one of the crewmen. But it has closed its inquiry into the sighting. \"It's a mys- tery,\" Steucke concedes, \"but, really, we have nothing here to investigate. The con- troller saw what he saw... As far as what it could be, on the extreme side it could have been the proverbial unknown object, or possibly military aircraft from the United States, Canada or some foreign country.\" As for Terauchi, he told a UPI reporter that he believes the object he saw over the Alas- ka sky that night must have come from another planet with a civilization far more advanced than ours. Only that can explain, he says lightly, their interest in his cargo: cases of French Beaujolais wine.

FROM THE EDITOR The UFO year got off to an auspicious debut with the NEWSWEEK article pictured on the cover. Also picked up by the major wire services, the story appeared in many newspapers and on both radio and television. From the preliminary attention, it just may be the one rare recent sighting on which the media follows through with a fullscale investigation. Unfortunately, judging by past precedent, it could just as easily be ignored and lost in the shuffle of Irangate. Already I've heard both that the UFO had been \"explained\" as the shadow of the spotting airplane, and that another UFO had been reported in the same area, leading the FAA to initiate their own investigation. We'll have complete coverage of what's known on the case next issue. In the meantime, there's enough afoot already to make 1987 one of the most promising years in memory for ufology. Besides the MUFON symposium at American University in June, the Fourth International UFO Congress gets underway two weeks later in London. In addition, several outstanding and/or controversial books are on the way from major publishers, including Whitley Strieber's COMMUNION, Budd Hopkins' KITLEY WOODS (Random House), and from Atlantic Monthly Press, Gary Kinder's LIGHT YEARS: An Investigation into the Extraterrestrial Experiences of Eduard Meier, a work that reportedly takes a sympathetic approach to Meier's claims, long regarded as an elaborate hoax within the UFO community.

Goring A synopsis of a lecture given at the Donmar Warehouse Theatre, 41 Earlham Street, London WC2, England on Monday, 30 June, 1986 by Dr. Jacques Vallee. This article was provided by Ignacio Damaude Rojas-Marcos of Seville, Spain. Following an introduction by a representative of The International Centre for UFO Research, a USA- based organization soon to open a London Office, Dr. Jacques Vallee took the floor with generous applause from an audience that had traveled from far and wide to see him. Dr. Vallee appeared to be about 45 years-old, some 6 ft. 2 inches tall and of rather outstanding appearance. Classed by most UFO researchers as a world-leading authority on UFOs, he holds a Master's degree in astrophysics and a Ph.D. in computer science. Dr. Vallee currently resides in San Francisco, California where he has researched the UFO phenomenon for many years. Dr. Vallee addressed his audience in clear, confident English — albeit with a slight French accent — and at a speed at times to equal our own redoubtable fast speaker Patrick Moore! Before touching on the UFO phenomenon itself, though, he expressed his deep regret at the death, on 27 April this year, of colleague and friend Dr. Joseph Allen Hynek, the leading light of ufologists worldwide for many years, and known to anyone with an interest in UFOs. Following this sad announce- ment he began his lecture by giving a basic introduction to the UFO phenomenon together with details of how he first became involved in the early 1960s, when strange objects appeared in the sky on several occasions. Due to this being a public lecture with children present making up perhaps 150 people in all, it was necessary for Dr. Vallee to keep to a simplified level much of the time. DATA PATTERNS Dr. Vallee described how he had amassed UFO cases over the years in order to form a database of information which filled many filing cabinets, and from this data he had searched for patterns in UFO behavior. One of the important findings he displayed with the aid of a photographic slide was trie tendency, clearly displayed in his diagrams of pie charts, for UFO sightings to occur in 50% or so of all sightings in isolated places, a situation that is true for cases in both France and other countries. This suggests, he believes, a desire for the UFOs to stay clear of highly populated areas. . Dr. Vallee made numerous references to the film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" in which he was the model for the scientist Lacombe, and remarked that various scenes were true as they had taken place before....like that of an air traffic control radar operator asking an airline if they wanted to report a UFO, and another where a man is shown watching a UFO emit light of a color difficult to identify, which parallels many witnesses' reports of strange colors from UFOs. Besides mentioning a number of well known cases like that of M. Maurice Masse who found a UFO and occupants in his lavender field at Valensole, France, 1 July, 1965, and the UFO and beings sighted by police patrolman Lonnie Zamora at Socorro, New Mexico, 24 April, 1964, Dr. Vallee delved into some of the off-beat aspects of UFOs and related how they have appeared in some unexpected places. He showed slides of UFOs adorning record sleeves, different parts of buildings and walls, and graffiti praising UFO intelligencies that could be found almost anywhere. Some good examples were shown which clearly indicated the extent to which UFOs have influenced ordinary people and created in many what amounts to a blind belief with subsequent cults. \"UMMO\" One famous case that Dr. Vallee dwelled on often is that known as UMMO which he believes, after careful examination, to be a cult and a hoax perpetrated mainly on the Spanish nation, and created more or less as an experiment to see how long a cult like this can be carried on relying purely on man's gullibility and blind faith. Briefly, the UMMO case began in the mid-60's with many written messages and telephone calls being received by mainly those of Spanish society with responsible, respectable professions. Such communications contained astounding information pertaining to philosophy, science and most of the subject matters which concern mankind. Those responsible for passing on such information have tried to convince the recipients that they are aliens who arrived on Earth from the far off planet UMMO in 1950. The UMMO message suggest superior intelligence and knowledge, but overall, Dr. Vallee believes the information is just to gain the confidence of people in order to form a cult. Deception and cult forming in order to manipulate people and control them appears to be on a worldwide scale, and if continued over a period of time could mold society with social and political restructuring taking place. These could well be the goals lying hidden in the UFO phenomenon. Dr. Vallee is unsure of the origin and identity of the UFOs' intelligences, but he doesn't 'believe them to be extraterrestrial. Dr. Vallee considers three aspects of the UFO phenomenon worthy of further study: The UFO itself, which behaves like (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"VALLEE, Continued a small volume of space within which a large amount of energy is stored, equal to that of a small power station. This energy is manifested by various beams of electromagnetic radiation. Abductions. Abductees are quite possibly on mind trips and the UFOs they relate seeing and entering during hypnotic regression are not true physical objects. 1 The witnesses here, Dr. Vallee feels, are possibly exposed to unknown energies which cause disorientation and mind manipulation as a result. The Social level, or the impact that UFOs have on society with the controlling of human beings and their molding of society. ABSURDITY QUOTIENT One peculiarity of contact with UFO occupants, Dr. Vallee said, was the level of absurdity noted in conversations with ufonauts — ridiculous statements, questions and replies, pointless contacts and the apparent naivety displayed by supposedly superior beings. Dr. Vallee tentatively believes that the absurd statements, etc., have a confused effect on UFO-occupant witnesses by creating moments of conscious psychological disruption during which something else unperceived takes place. The effect of absurdity also serves, of course, to deter those scientists who might otherwise become interested. As for UFOs' possible origins, Dr. Vallee feels a promising line of investigation to be that of particle physics, or the world of the atom. Like Dr. J. Allen Hynek with whom he worked for some time as part of the \"Invisible College\" 2 of UFO researchers, he feels UFOs could well originate from the alternate realities of so-called other dimensions, a possibility that he has been considering as of late. However, despite his years of study into the UFO phenomenon, Dr. Vallee admits that he could well be wrong about some aspects and that many learned scientists who had looked into this UFO business had come to different conclusions. Of the people making up the audience, Dr. Vallee recognized some ufological luminaries present, although of these I could only recognize and see Mr. Gordon Creighton of Flying Saucer Review magazine, in which publication Dr. Vallee's lecture was advertised. These ufologists, said Dr. Vallee rather humbly, had more knowledge than he of the many UFO cases, etc., and would appreciate above all others the terrible problems involved in trying to resolve the enigma. One of the most interesting periods in the lecture occurred during the final 50 minutes or so when questions from the audience were invited. In reply to a query concerning his book Messengers of Deception, 3 an investigation into UFO contacts and cults, Dr. Vallee said that if he were to write the same book today he would write it differently. He indicated that the material he had to deal with was difficult to appraise and appreciate, and neither did it sit well on the scientific fraternity's bookshelf. An American woman in the audience related her experiences with UFOs in France and South America. Her story was that she had gone to Rennes in France where she received, being as she claimed \"clairvoyant\" and \"psychic,\" messages that UFOs would appear at a specific place and time — which, she said, they did! She added that she had also spent some time — three weeks — in South America and visited places in Peru like Machu Picchu and Lake Titicaca. 4 While there she was apparently told again that UFOs would appear at certain times and this they duly did. Another woman in the audience broke in at this point to ask her why she didn't take photographs of the UFOs (the American woman had a camera with her at the time), and the reply came that she had tried to take photographs, but the camera for some unknown reason would not work. The American woman continued that while at these ancient sites observing the UFOs there were many other witnesses beside herself — mostly, it seems, Peruvians. But these people did not find the UFOs amazing or an unusual sight, but rather a very common occurrence....rather like, the woman said, one would regard the sight of cars on an American freeway. Dr. Vallee was then asked if he would comment on what she had experienced, but he found it very difficult to do so and said he wished he could have been with her to witness the objects. This brought some laughter from the audience. Another question concerned retrieved UFO occupants. Dr. Vallee could not give a definite answer here but gave every indication that he was not in favor of their existence. In connection with alleged military- retrieved alien beings from crashed UFOs, he said that the Americans at least have launched monkeys and these have been dressed in silver space suits. Some of these space shots with monkeys aboard had probably crashed many times in the past and the military would have made an all-out effort to retrieve.them, their activities appearing to an outsider as. a large, secret operation. And a charred monkey in a silver space suit could easily look like a small alien being. I thought of this as a rather poor effort by Dr. Vallee to sweep the .floor of crashed UFOs and their occupants, but it was obvious to me that he was not happy to be drawn into this aspect of ufology and said little more about it. I would have liked to have had a question of my own answered during this period, but was unsuccessful. 5 A round of applause finally concluded Dr. Vallees lecture. To my mind those present who had parted with £3.50 for a ticket did not leave the Donmar Warehouse . Theatre disappointed. NOTES 1) The following is just one example showing how contrary opinions among those who have extensively researched the UFO phenomenon can be. Mr. Budd Hopkins is the American author of the book Missing Time, which reveals the investigation by hypnotic regression of events that supposedly took place during the time unaccounted for by people who've been abducted by UFO intelligences. When asked on my behalf what he finds to be the most common thread running through these abduction cases, Budd Hopkins replied that there is only one thing which is totally common to ALL abductions and that is that they are \"physical\" happenings — they (continued on page 17)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"UFO INTERCEPTS ROCKET By T. Scott Grain, Jr. T. Scott Grain, Jr., isaMUFON state section director, Pennsylvan- ia, and a Journal staff-writer. It is no secret to the seasoned UFO investigator that various agencies of the U.S. Government have taken the position of withholding \"the good stuff about UFOs from the American public. One only has to look at the thousands of pages of government documents released under the Freedom of Information Act to know that UFOs are of immense interest to the Department of State, the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as the FBI, CIA, NSA and DIA.' In the case of military UFO sightings, they are of particularly high value to civilian UFO investigators, because so few of them reach the general public out of fear of military retribution. 2 In the report that follows, the witness remained silent for 18 years, before revealing full details of how he filmed the appearance of a UFO and the destruction of an American missile off the coast of California in 1964. LAUNCH FILMED The incident occurred on September 15, 1964 3 near Big Sur, California, about 180 miles north in the mountains. The Instrumentation Section of the 1369th Photographic Squadron was dispatched from Vandenberg Air Force Base to film an Atlas F missile being launched over the Pacific Ocean. Officer-in charge, First Lieutenant Robert Jacobs, along with his film crew and a group of civilian operators, set up a TV camera on a 2500-inch focal length catadioptric telescope to record the missile test. Ground operators kept the telescope locked on to the moving missile by means of radar. As far as Jacobs was concerned, the filming that day of the launch was a success, and he returned to Vandenberg with the film of the flight. Two days later, Jacobs was ordered to report to the office of his commanding officer, Major Florenz J. Mansmann, who was chief science officer at Vandenberg. The purpose of the meeting was to show Jacobs the film he had just photographed. Present at the screening were Mansmann, Jacobs, and two men in business suits who were later identified as CIA agents from Washington, D.C. As the four men watched the missile on the screen soar 60 miles above the Pacific, a UFO suddenly came into the picture, just after the missile's final booster stage had dropped off. Jacobs describes what he saw: \"On the screen it was impossible for me to tell what the exact shape of the object was. Relative to the screen, considering the distance from our tracking site, it was a very small point of light. I was quite startled to see anything up there but our warhead. The object flew into the frame from the left and circled the warhead, emitting brilliant flashes of light four times....\" The first flash came when it flew , up to the missile from the left. It then maneuvered above the missile for the second flash and finally circled around the rocket and flashed two more times from other angles, before flying away. Jacobs said the missile warhead \"did NOT hit its target. It malfunctioned and fell several hundred miles short,\" tumbling into the Pacific Ocean shy of its destination. After the screening, Mansmann asked Jacobs if he had any idea what those brilliant \"strobelike\" flashes were, to which neither man could make a decision, except that it was a UFO. What followed astonished Jacobs, for his superior officer, Major Mansmann, informed him to \"tell no one about this,\" that \"it never happened,\" and \"if you ever are questioned about it you're to say that it was caused by laser tracking.\" The film was turned over to the CIA agents, Jacobs says, and both he and Mansmann were told to keep quiet about the matter. The film was never seen again. ANALYSIS In private correspondence with the witness (July 25,1986), Robert Jacobs, Ph.D., shared with me details of this episode as he remembers them. Jacobs was the officer-in charge of the photo-optical instrumentation at Vandenberg AFB from March, 1963 through April, 1966. The commander of the 1369th was Lt. Col. Lewis Clement and the Operations Officer was Captain Kenneth J. Callahan. Unfortunately, neither of these two men had any knowledge of the UFO film, but could attest that Jacobs was stationed there and set up the tracking site at Big Sur. Jacob's assignment in 1964 was to film missile launches and provide photography designed to fool Russian radar. 4 Jacobs was not aware he had filmed a UFO until that day in Mahsmann's office. Jacobs saw the film once and said after that one quick viewing the object looked like a \"small point of light.\" However, Mansmann studied the film in depth. Jacobs said that \"Mansmann, who inspected the film with a magnifier, says that the object was saucer-shaped with a dome on top.\" Mansmann is a key collaborating witness in this incident. According to an article in OMM magazine, Mansmann confirms Jacobs story claiming, \"I have never, ever seen anything like that before or since.\"* I tried contacting Mansmann by letter on July 30,1986, with no success. Jacobs says he understands why Mansmann ordered him to forget about the incident, because of the \"provisions of the security act.\" Jacobs said (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ROCKET, Continued Mansmann confirmed the other two men in the office were CIA agents, but he doubted Mansmann would tell me their names for fear of \"reprisal.\" What does the Air Force think of these revelations of a downed missile and the appearance of the UFO? \"We have no documentation of a UFO incident...The dummy warhead hit the target,\" claims the Air Force spokesman in the OMNI article. 6 To settle the matter once and for all, the people at OMNI requested to see the confiscated film, and were waiting a response from the Air Force. I wrote to OMNI Publications International Ltd. on August 4 and August 12, 1986, to find out what response they got. OMNI has not answered either request. What does Jacobs really think he photographed that day'? He is convinced it was an \"intelligently guided spacecraft of unknown origin to me,\" that may have been an early demonstration of the beginnings of the military dabbling in what we now know as S.D.I, or Star Wars. \"I am further convinced that powers higher up the military and civilian echelons than I, KNEW that the 'demonstration' was going to happen and that my mission in setting up the tracking site at Vandenberg was done specifically to photograph it.\" Could we have had the technology in 1964 to have a vehicle whose appearance has been described as saucer-shaped with a dome on top, take out one of our own missiles as a field demonstration? Would the vehicle still be a secret more than two decades later? Jacobs admits he doesn't know what that object was or where it came from, but he still thinks the government may be behind it. CONCLUSIONS When Jacobs' story first hit the news on October 12, 1982, in the National Enquirer, the initial reaction by the Air Force was, according to Jacobs, that the incident never happened. They also informed several investigators that Jacobs was never in the service or worked out of Vandenberg AFB. The National Enquirer checked out Jacobs' service record before they printed the story. And the fact that Mansmann confirms Jacobs story as truthful negates the Air Force's feeble attempt of discrediting Jacobs' tour of duty. • In January-, 1985, Eric Mishara writes in the Anti-Matter column of OMM that an Air Force spokesman now confirms that the missile in question was launched and hit its target. Who was the Air Force spokesman? Did the staff at OMNI ever see Jacobs film? Unanswered question. I have contacted Robert Todd of Citizen's Against UFO Secrecy for assistance on how to obtain a copy of Jacobs' film thru a Freedom of Information Act request. However, lacking the film's final destination, our efforts have been fruitless, to date. Jacobs was honorably discharged from the Air Force in September 1967, after returning from duty in Ramstein Air Force Base, Germany. He is currently a Visual-Arts professor at the University of Wisconsin. REFERENCES 1.) Fawcett, Lawrence, and Barry J. Greenwood. Clear Intent - The Coverup of the UFO Experience.

UFOLOGY & THE EDGES OF SCIENCE By Michael Swords Michael Swords is an associate professor of natural sciences at Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo. Cosmologists are waging a debate over the beginning of the Universe (\"how and when\"; the theologians have long ago captured the market on \"why\"). None of this is settled, of course; big questions never are. We are estimating the \"when\" of it all, and some figures are placing that event between 11 and 15 billion years ago. When the Universe \"went off\" with that Biggest Bang, we entered an age of expansion, dissipation of energy, and formation of simple particles and atoms. For a long undetermined time, Creation consisted of relatively unorganized chaos composed of radiation and very light atoms. In time gravity began to structure the galactic clusters, and the stars which constitute them. Around 10 billion years ago, our galaxy, the Milky Way, \"gelled\" into a gigantic multi-billion star aggregation, signalled by a still-mysterious titanic nuclear event at its center. The Universe, much in the shape we know it, had begun. Our own neonatal galaxy was sterile and it remained that way for hundreds of millions of years. It was sterile because it was composed of only the light atoms which had coalesced out of the Expansion energies of the Big Bang. No carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, or metals existed in the earliest galaxy. They were being cooked up, fused, in the bellies of the first generation stars. A small percentage of these early stars were the large \"Blue Giants,\" which burn hot and fast, and explode in spectacular supernovas. They burned. They blew. And they sprinkled their heavy, fused Stardust about the galaxy. (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"UFOLOGY, Continued For a few billion years, the supernovas went off like fireworks in the dark, announcing the coming opportunity for life to finally arise. The galaxy slowly densified. The giant molecular clouds formed. And from them would come the first lifebearing systems. LIFE ARISES The later generations of stars condensed from clouds of gas and heavy dust, bringing with them the first true planets. Now rocky spheres with water and atmospheres would speckle the galaxy and begin the process of life and the long road to intelligence. These first heavy-element systems probably arose just beyond the deadly violence of the galactic center — in the dense gas and star-region near where the \"3 kiloparsec arm\" of the Milky Way is today. Not yet come-to-be, twenty-odd thousand light years away, our Sun was only a gleam in the galactic eye. The first heavy element planetary systems began the life-trek perhaps 7 or 8 billion years ago; 2 to 3 billion years before our solar system was born. Life for the first bio-systems may have been short and violent. The density of the starscape, the ominous proximity of the nucleus, may have scoured the early ecologies clean with waves of starburst radiation. At some safer distance and density, though, life not only rooted but went on. With a small number of (to me) reasonable assumptions we can play a graphical game with galactic history. We will graph \"Time\" across the X-axis, and \"Numbers\" up the Y. The graph in the test shows a 10 billion year galactic history running horizontally, and numbers (amounts) to about 1 billion running vertically. The beginning of the game is \"sun-like stars with Earths in the Life Zone.\" Assuming that the first of these began after the sterile period about 7 billion years ago, and that we have about 1 billion of them now, a straight line drawn between those two points symbolizes that: a) such star-formation proceeded in a smooth uniform rate during this period (possibly untrue, but not overly significant to our game since we had to 8 get from zero to 1 billion in that 7 billion years somehow, and. . .) b) such stars have not been destroyed since their time of creation (almost invariably true since these non- sterile sunlikes live longer than seven billion years). The other two assumptions, starting at 7 billion years ago and ending today with 1 billion systems of proper character, are based on the lengthy sterile period (as explained earlier) and an extensive \"life zones\" discussion in the ETI literature (see references). Once drawn, the slanting line approximates the number of heavy element, planet-bearing, sun-like solar systems with Earth-like planets in the Life Zone for every phase of galactic history. Now the rest of the graph is fairly easy. Life at an elementary level seems to \"jump\" into being at almost the first opportunity (which due to the extreme heat of the new-born planets takes about a half billion cool-down years). So another line, parrallel to the first and lagging a half billion years behind it approximates the life-bearing Earths in these Sun-like systems. The only assumptions are that a) life will form when the conditions are right; and b) that it doesn't disappear at this elementary level. Such assumptions, given what we know about elementary life to date, seem eminently probable. The next three slanting parallel lines (for advanced life, intelligences, and civilizations) would be the indicators of amounts in galactic history for those categories if a) such developments are inevitable once life gets started (as many believe); (and they arise at about the same pace as they did on Earth); and b) once such developments arise, they don't disappear (much debated, especially as regards civilizations). Note that, if the assumptions were anywhere near true, we would have a galaxy containing 300 to 400 million technical civilizations today; or one such civilization for every thousand stars. If these civilizations arose and did not die out, and if the Sun is in an average segment of the galaxy, then we should have a \"neighbor\" within about 50 light years, and within 100 light years we should have about nine technically advanced space cousins. THE ASSUMPTIONS How \"far out\" is this viewpoint? Well, it depends on the \"far-out-ness\" of the assumptions, obviously. #1. The galaxy was sterile for the first period of its history. Scientifically this may even be a conservative assumption. Systems near the nucleus may have started even earlier. The effect on the graph though will be small. #2. There are currently about one billion \"proper\" systems for advanced life. My referenced paper indicates that this estimate is also conservative, and the number could be 5 to 10 times higher. #3. Star systems formed at a uniform rate across the period. Debated, but probably irrelevant: all a faster early rate would do is make our straight lines into rising and flattening curves. #4. Star systems are not destroyed. Certainly true for 99%+ of the systems we're talking about. #5. Life forms rapidly, spontaneously. Essentially certain from our knowledge of Cosmochemistry and Protobilogy. #6. Elementary life on proper systems in life zones will not go extinct. Essentially certain from our knowledge of Earth's biological resilience. > #7. Advanced life will arise given time. Essentially certain due to the work of Ilya Prigogine on the inevitability of rising complexity in metastable self-organizing systems (such as life). #8. Advanced life will not go permanently extinct once it has arisen. Whereas specific forms do go extinct, the ability of the lower levels to rapidly regenerate advanced types becomes more powerful with every extinction event paradoxically. #9. Intelligence will arise. This is just a special case of #7. #10. Intelligence will not permanently disappear once it has arisen. Again, a special case of #8. So far, so good — now the problem: #11.

By Marge Christensen The author is MUFON's Director of Public Relations. How often have you heard these .lines from someone in the UFO field? \"I've given the better part of my life to this subject, only to come up against a brick wall. The government won't be honest with people; the media won't take the subject seriously, and frankly, I just don't care anymore. I've got other things to devote my energies to.\" This sad, but altogether too widespread song is being sung by a great many competent UFO investigators and researchers throughout the country. In fact, I heard it just last week from someone certainly bright enough to know better than to make such statements. The problem with such comments is that they graphically illustrate the speaker's lack of current information on the subject of UFO research. Yes, it is true that the government is not exactly bending over backward to assist us in obtaining information, but it has certainly handed over some \"jackpot\" documents under the F.O.I.A. requests filed very recently. True the media is not cooperating in publishing serious UFO articles, and also admittedly true is the unfortunate fact that the tabloids are only too happy to splash sensational UFO stories throughout their pages. What is also true, however, and what the apathetic UFOlogist has not realized is that we are now standing at a truly important turning point in UFO research. The wealth of information being gathered by respected researchers such as Budd Hopkins, Richard Haines, John Schuessler, Bruce Maccabee, David Jacobs, Jim McCampbell, Alan Holt, Dan Wright, Michael Swords, and scores of others is some of the most intriguing and convincing information ever accumulated on the subject. The patterns and similarities that have been studied with regard to cases from all corners of the globe over a wide span of years cannot be simply dismissed without serious scrutiny. FOIA SUITS Add to all of this the outstanding work being done by persons such as Barry Greenwood, Larry Fawcett, Robert Todd, and other CAUS members in obtaining vast amounts of official data'from the various agencies of the federal government on the subject of UFOs, and the eyewitness, testimony also obtained by CAUS in regard to many of the incidents mentioned in the documents. Again we have an impressive and massive amount of data from highly placed sources, and we also have a situation where one document or a witness serves to verify of substantiate information in other documents. In short, the pieces of the UFO puzzle are beginning to fall into place at a steady pace. The overall picture which is beginning to be constructed by all of this information is extremely intriguing, and also very revealing. In many cases, the pieces of the puzzle are beginning to lead to new avenues of research, new sources, new questions, and, hopefully, eventually, new answers. These new areas of research and new questions are being pursued, but not as quickly as we would like because of the problems of lack of manpower and lack of funding. Ironically, our apathetic UFOlogistsare only making the manpower shortage more severe by their decisions to call it quits in the field. There is no doubt that the UFO phenomenon is a multi-faceted phenomenon, and that we need persons in a wide spectrum of disciplines in order to thoroughly study it. This does not apply to areas of science only. We need persons trained in other areas as well. EXPENSES We cannot afford apathy in the UFO field. The costs of frustration, and of research funded out of one's own pocket, and the cost of personal time for research all combined, are still less costly than the price of ignoring the subject altogether. The UFO phenomenon is going to have an impact on every aspect of human life on planet Earth someday, and that is not something we can simply choose to ignore. The subject must be researched. Frustration is a small price to pay for what might be potentially gained from serious UFO research. So, the next time one of your fellow UFOlogists says to you, \"So I'm apathetic; Who cares?\" impress upon him or her that you care, we all care, and that he/she would do well to start caring too. Ask the person if he doesn't care about UFOs, does he care about humanity? None of us is involved in the field because we care about UFOs. It is because we care about what impact UFOs will have upon our planet and our civilization that we are dedicating our energies toward finding out more about .the UFO subject. Perhaps if those among us who have given in to apathy or frustration were given some new direction or a bit of positive encouragement from those of us who are aware of where UFO research is today, and why we are in the field for life, we might not have as many UFO dropouts as we do. Human resources are a terrible thing to waste. Let's all work to prevent it from happening.

More recently, a growing number of researchers realize the importance of addressing the other half of the problem: the psychological and social aspects of UFO experiences. For these aspects are just as, if not more, important to our understanding of both the phenomena and our world at large. In 1982, the Percipient Studies Project (PSP) was initiated with the aim of researching the human factors involved in anomalous experiences. The project will examine the 10 psychological, sociological, physiolog- ical and alleged parapsychological aspects of UFO experiences and related phenomena. The aims are to increase our understanding of: (1) UFOs and other anomalous phenomena; and (2) human experiences and behaviour in general. To achieve this, the Percipient Studies Project plans to involve behavioural scientists and other interested researchers in the in-depth study of individual percipients to anomalous experiences, the comparison of groups of percipients and non-percipients, and any other studies deemed relevant. As an initial project, the PSP would like to set up an Australian capability for the in-depth psychological and physiological study of UFO percipients. It is intended to establish a set of standardized psychological and medical testing procedures which will produce useful data of the least ambiguous nature. It is envisaged that the application of these techniques would be especially relevent to UFO cases involving pronounced psychological reactions, \"repeater\" percipients and PSIUFO phenomena. The involvement of psychologists, psychiatrists, hypnotherapists and medical personnel as field investigators or consultants would be desirable.

Dr. McDonald's -paper was entitled \"Science in Default.\" Maccabee's presentation was an update of the paper presented nearly 20 years ago by McDonald. Maccabee's paper pointed out that erroneous explanations for some of the earliest cases gave rise to the generally accepted opinion that all sightings could be explained: In particular, Maccabee pointed out that the late Dr. Howard Menzel, a famous Harvard astrophysicist, '\"solved\" an important early sighting by leaving out quantitative data: The sighting was that of C.B. Moore and several Navy'enlisted men (April 24, 1949), which Menzel',' in his first book, Flying Saucers, called one of. the \"best authenticated\" of the early sightings, and which 'he proceeded to explain as a mirage of a balloon which Moore and the others had launched. Macabee showed that Menzel's own calculations proved that the explanation does not fit the .available data. He further argued that Menzel did not include in the book the observational data available, because — 'if he had — any intelligent person could' have immediately seen that the explanation was completely unsatisfactory. Other early sightings that were discussed, in some detail in the paper are the Kenneth Arnold sighting, reports made in 1950 during Project Twinkle, and sightings by personnel of the General Mills Skyhook balloon, project. 'After discussing these sightings, Dr. Maccabee recounted his attempts to' publish UFO papers in scientific journals. He has submitted papers to Science, Nature, Applied Optics, and the Journal of Atmospherics and Terrestrial Physics. Only in the case of Applied Optics^ was he able to publish two short papers, both related to the New Zealand case. The editor of that journal published the papers in spite of his claim that \"UFO believers\" are \"99 and 44/100 percent kooks.\" Dr. Maccabee's paper is.published in \" the 'MUFON Symposium Proceedings available from MUFON (103 Oldtowne Road, Segum, TX 78155-4099) for $11.50 including postage. The Proceedings is a 186-page publication containing ten- major papers. One of the other papers in the Proceedings is by Dr. Richard Haines, a member of the National Board of the FUND.

WEBB Walter N. Webb is a MUFON consultant in astronomy and a CUFOS field investigator. A letter from Mrs. Domenica E. Falcione, 15 Taft Drive, Winchester, Massachusetts, arrived at the Museum of Science, Boston, on August 5, 1986, and was turned over to the museum's Lyman Library. Mrs. Falcione vividly described her neighborhood's encounter with explosive ball lightning on the afternoon of July 3, 1986. The letter was forwarded to my desk in the planetarium, and at the same time a card was sent to the witness, explaining that I was on vacation. I was unable to get back to Mrs. Falcione until November 12, four months after her sighting. I made an appointment to see her at her home on November 16. A two-hour interview ensued during which the witness described her observation in detail and took me on a tour of the house and yard to show me where the damage had occurred. I also had time to briefly question one of three neighbors who also had observed the lightning ball. My own diary stated the following for July 3: \"Rain off and on all day. Thunderstorms.\" While Winchester is situated about 16 miles (by air) north of my town, Mrs. Falcione did recall that there was a light rain that day, although she could not remember any thunder. The ball appeared in the presence of a light rain and a darkening sky but in the absence of thunder and conventional lightning. The sky conditions were threatening enough that she sent her grandson Jimmy home prior to the incident. WEATHER On November 21 I called David Taylor of Weather Services Corporation in Bedford and asked for climatological data from the nearest collection point — Bedford — for 2 p.m. July 3. Bedford is seven miles 12 northwest of the Winchester site. Taylor had assisted me once before in another ball lightning (BL) episode at Hanson in July of 1985 (see my report \"Two Ball Lightning Episodes at Plymouth and Hanson, Massachusetts, June 24 and July 4, 1985\"). The 2 p.m. Bedford data follows (see box). At the time specified (2:20 p.m.) Mrs. Falcione said she was standing behind the kitchen table when she suddenly looked out the north window and spotted a peculiar glowing object hovering above a grove of evergreen trees in her neighbor's -back yard (Genevieve Dale, 46 High Street). She walked over to the window to get a better look. The red ball was not intensely bright nor surrounded by an outward glow or halo. It appeared to be perfectly stationary and without internal motion during the estimated 20-to-30-second duration of her sighting. (I timed her reenactment of the sighting but still believe this figure is very uncertain.) Although the wintess was unable to estimate the ball's true size, she thought it had the apparent size of a \"nice big harvest moon.\" I estimated the BL's elevation at about 15° and its distance at more than 100 feet from the rear of the house. Returning to her first position behind the table, Mrs. Falcione looked out again, briefly saw the ball, and then looked away. At this point she heard a tremendous explosion like a bomb and thought something had hit her roof. The only light on in the house at the time, a kitchen lamp, remained on. However, the burglar alarm and automatic lawn sprinkler system were going off, not only at her house but at other residences along the street. EFFECTS Quite frightened, the witness ran down the steps into the attached garage where she discovered that the cover on the meter box for the lawn sprinkler had blown off and the box itself was blackened and smoking. The plaster wall behind the box had buckled (from the heat?). The lights didn't work in the garage. Immediately Mrs. Falcione called the fire department. When the fire fighters arrived at the scene, they told the witness that they had also seen the ball as they drove down Taft Drive from the west. According to the witness, one of the firemen had commented to another: \"Oh, my God, where is it going to hit?\" (The fire truck must have already been in the neighborhood responding to a call in order to have spotted the ball so quickly.) Upon examining the woman's main fuse box, the firemen found half the fuses burned out. Mrs. Falcione was told to call an electrician right away. The electrician spent four hours at (continued next page) CLIMATE CONDITIONS Cloud Cover   Rain & fog Last Thunderstorm  1:30 p.m. Ceiling (Ft.)   3,000 Visibility (Mi.)   2 Temp.

He patched in a temporary hookup to the refrigerator so that it would work. The next day Mrs. Falcione said she found that a tree in her neighbor's yard to the west had been struck by the explosion, its bark stripped off and branches hurled in all directions. One big limb landed in the Falcione yard. At the same time a one-foot-deep hole was discovered below her fence where apparently, she reasoned, a side charge from the .explosion had followed underground wiring in the sprinkler system and emerged at a junction box, throwing soil upward against the fence. (Mrs. Falcione's daughter Nancy showed me photos of this and other damage.) Total repairs at the Falcione residence amounted to about $2,000. The explosion was heard over a large area. Mrs. Falcione's grandsons Jimmy and Gregory heard it from one and two miles away, respectively. (I met both boys.) At least three other neighbors around the Falcione house were said to have also seen the ball. The neighbor to the east, according to Mrs. Falcione, claimed that his dog became agitated prior to the explosion. While I was there, Mrs. Falcione kindly telephoned her neighbor to the north, Mrs. Dale, and asked her if she would allow me to question her about her own observation. Mrs. Dale said she was about to leave her house so she would have only a few minutes to see me. It was over her trees that Mrs. Falcione said she saw the ball. It turned out that Mrs. Dale herself spotted the ball above another back yard — possibly above the tree that was shattered by the explosion. (It is possible that the ball moved slightly during the interval between the Falcione and Dale sightings.) Mrs. Dale said she caught a brief glimpse of the ball through her second-floor bathroom window; the window faces the Falcione back yard toward the south. To Mrs. Dale, the ball appeared reddish-orange and, as in the Falcione observation, about the apparent size of the full moon. When Mrs. Dale turned away, she heard the explosion and soon was aware of a smell like that from an electrical fire. Ball lightning can either disappear silently or explode with a loud noise, sometimes causing damage ranging from minor to severe. Damage has occurred to wooden structures, aircraft, trees, and to the ground itself. One account attests to a red BL which dug a trench in the soil 300 feet long and three to six feet deep and then ripped away another 80 feet of stream bank! 1 BL sometimes causes shock and burns to people; there are even a few historical reports of animal and human deaths associated with the phenomenon. 2 Red, orange, and yellow are the most commonly reported colors for BL. I elected not to spend much time investigating this incident owing to its explainable nature as BL (though certainly it is an intriguing rare natural phenomenon). There were no house- to-house interviews; the fire fighter witnesses were not questioned; newspapers were not consulted. This written report instead represents a compilation from my notes taken during my interviews with two of the witnesses. NOTES 1. Bruce H. Bailey, \"Ball Lig/ifning,\" Weatherwise, June 1977. 2.

Neal, Jr., M.D. Dr. Richard M. Neal, Jr., is a MUFON consultant in medicine and a member of the Los Angeles UFO Research Group. Over the past four decades there have • been . numerous reports of physiological symptoms or physical injuries to individuals related to exposures of light sources emanating from unidentified luminous objects. Other reports concern injuries resulting from alleged direct contact with \"alien humanoids\" in \"space craft\", which in the witnesses' minds constitute some type of physical examination. All of these cases fall into a specific outlined form of physiological signs/symptoms reported following such reported exposures. Each symptom was part of a questionaire sent to witnesses who had contacted the author for medical advice following such encounters and are presented in the form below. All symptoms/injuries listed have been reported by various UFO witnesses over the last 40 years, since the inception of the modern era of UFO reports. The witnesses were also asked their conception of the following format \"relationship\" of the UFO or \"entity\" to themselves; Indirect: UFO merely overflew area with no apparent interest in the witness. Apparent Direct: UFO approach- ed witness during effects, UFO hovered over witness during effects. Actual Direct: Witness touched by UFO, Light beam, Entity or an instrument. Witnesses were also given an opportunity to make additional comments to the above statements. The information regarding reported UFO injuries/physiological symptoms collected in this article has been loosely gathered from various sources over the past several years, 14 including jounals of UFO research organizations and individual physicians interested in the UFO phenomena. It is apparent that there is a .need to establish more specific documentation of data collected from these sources and to establish some type of consistency in such data collection procedures. Definite physiological complaints should be investigated, defined and explained, if possible, as resulting from conventional rather than un-conventional- (UFO) causes. This same technique should apply to short and long term psychological effects reported by these victims. Medical injuries reported by UFO witnesses seem to fall into three categories:  . I. a. temporary paralysis (of varying parts of the body) b. dizziness c. temporary blindness d. headaches e. perception of unusual odors f. audio-frequency sounds (beeping, buzzing, etc.) g. parapsychological activity h. loss of consciousness II. a. skin lesions (burns, sores, b. gastro-intestional disturbance (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) c. abnormal pyschological mariifestions (change in personality, agitation, nightmares, etc.) III. •, a. short-term healing b. long term healing (weeks, months, years) , QUESTIONS • • •. When an individual is initially exposed to UFO activity how does this person handle what has happened to them? Who does he/she relate this traumatic experience to? Even after the event occurs, the victim often doesn't know quite what to do about it. Calls to the police, local newspaper arid Air Force authorities may bring little or no satisfication. Newspaper reporters who interview witnesses soon after the sighting are usually looking for \"human interest\" stories rather than scientific truth. If the report does get to a UFO research organization and investigators with scientific background, it is frequently too late to obtain documentation relating transitory or short term bruises, etc.) (continued next page) PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS Hair stood on end Hair burned Hair turned white Hair fell out Eyes watered Eyes smarted Eyes out of focus Eyes blinded Eardrums vibrated ' Ears hurt Ears deafened Nose irritated Nose bled Bled through mouth Tooth fillings vibrated Shook nervously Felt dizzy Felt sluggish Felt nauseated Had headache Organs vibrated Dry heaved Vomited Passed urine Passed stool Felt warmer Felt colder Felt lighter Felt heavier Floated in air Felt electric shock Became paralyzed Body perspired Felt burning sensation Skin was burned Experienced skin rash Experienced warts Experienced body marks Experienced body wounds Skin peeled off Neck muscles ached Arm muscles ached Leg muscles ached Spinal column ached"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PROTOCOL, Continued physiological symptoms. The following represent the sources usually approached by UFO witnesses: 1. Family arid Close Friends. Victims often relate their experience to someone whom they assume will be sympathetic and understanding, but this often results in no further action .being taken on the case. 2.) Law Enforcement: Victims may go directly to law enforcement officers to relate their experience and also to ask that police document the area where the exposure/encounter/abduc- tion allegedly took place. Few police departments, however, follow through on such requests, regarding such reports as \"nusiance calls\" or not within their jurisdiction. 3.) UFO Organizations: In an effort to try and understand what occured to them, witnesses may contact a private UFO research organization to relate their experience. If such UFO organizations are not in the immediate vicinity some determined witnesses seek out national UFO organizations. This process is time consuming and meanwhile physiological symptoms fade or disappear. More direct and efficient contact between witnesses and UFO research organizations is desperately needed. 4.) Retained Experience: Some .individuals never relate their experience in order to avoid being ridiculed or ostracized at work, school, community, etc. There is speculation that hundreds of people have retained their experience/ordeal. It is estimated that only one in ten such experiences are ever reported, therefore valuable information/documentation is lost forever. 5.) Experience Reported at a Later Date: Even if such experiences are eventually reported weeks or years later, this is also unfortunate because specific lab studies are not performed within a reasonable period of time. Physical injuries may still be documented if there are residual scars. But most evidence of damage including initial photographic evidence is lost. However, good psychological profile screening or regressive hypnosis may prove beneficial in this group of individuals. 6.) Air Force Authorities: Reports made to the Air Force are usually an exercise in futility. These reports are rarely followed up by the Air Force; in any event, even if made, these investigative reports are not shared publicly. Again vital information is lost to civilian researchers seeking scientific facts. DOCUMENTATION NEEDED If members of the family, close friends, law enforcement officers or UFO investigative teams see that an individual has suffered some type of alleged UFO-caused physical injury, these individuals should be taken or referred to an emergency room or family physician for examination. Physicians' medical records of victims/ patients that have received such physical injuries would give a basic foundation to work with. It is essential to find out where on the victim's body the majority of injuries/symptoms have occured. --,Such immediate action forestalls fear in relating the event. The emotion of the moment also conquers some witnesses' tendencies to embellish their UFO experience. Immediate action also overshadows expectation of embarrassment or reprisal. Patient/victims who decide to seek medical help must be assured of confidentiality and anonymity if requested. Vital first hand information on medical injuries is lost during this time unless the patient/victim actually discusses the truth with the physician in an atmosphere of complete trust. Most of such victims seem to have sincere personal reactions to these traumatic experiences. They try to make it clear that what was observed or seen was definitely something that was not ordinary or familiar. The curious scientist or physician will have more to work with if full hard facts are presented to them and recorded without prejudice. Only a very small percentage of injury/symptom cases are referred to physicians. I suggest that physicians set up a national network screening procedure whereby each could follow a specific protocol for work-up of these individuals. Such procedures might include: 1.) Thorough history and physical examinations. 2.) Photographs of medical injuries. 3.) Specific laboratory tests, i.e.: a. CBC (complete blood count), Platelet count, Eosinophil count (5cc blood). b. Biochemical analysis-Serum electrolytes (Potassium, Sodium Chloride and CO 2 ) Calcium, Phosphorus, Glucose, Cortisol (lOcc). Perhaps in the near future a specific hormone or enzyme may give additional information. ' c. Urine: Routine urinalysis- check specifically for ketones and protein-drug screen. d. Biopsies of skin lesions (if warranted). e. Chest x'-ray (AP & LAT.) 4. Psychological screening profile. 5. Regressive hypnosis proced- ures, if associated with loss of time, may or may not prove beneficial. 6. Screen for radiation/electro- magnetic effects. Under this proposal 1, 2, 3, and 6 should be done immediately when the patient is seen. Numbers 4 and 5 should be performed at a later date, probably less than one month, by a psychiatrist . or psychologist experienced in these procedures. . All UFO research organizations should have effective .channeling techniques for referral of victims to a physician within their respective area. Once this protocol is followed and information is obtained it should be referred to physicians on the panel screening network. This information after being screened carefully, would be presented to a Blue Ribbon Panel Group (of three physicians). All data on these cases thus handled should be correlated to see if some types of patterns emerge. As more information is collected from time to. time the protocol could be updated with additions or deletions of specific tests. Ideally the victim/patient should be seen within 24-48 hours following their (continued on page 18) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PENNSYLVANIA PHYSICAL TRACE? By Stan Gordon Stan Gordon is director of PASU, the Pennsylvania Associa- tion for the Study of the Unexplained. It was the night of August 31,1986, and it was the Labor Day weekend. At approximately 9 P.M., travelers along new Route 119, in the vicinity of the Volkswagen assembly plant near New Stantpn, Pa., noticed a large lighted object that appeared to be an aircraft in trouble approaching from the West. The object was coming down at a very low altitude and gave the impression that it was going to crash. The travelers moving .in both Northbound and Southbound lanes lost sight of the object for a few seconds as they came around a hill. As they approached the position where the object was last seen, they noticed the top of the embankment was in flames. Several motorists from both sides of the highway stopped their cars and climbed the steep hillside thinking that an aircraft had indeed crashed. BURN AREA One man had canoe paddles in his van and he took them up to the site to help stomp out the flames. When these people arrived at the fire site, a 9- foot diameter circular area was found aflame. About 2 feet away another 3 foot area was also on fire. The flames shot up about 4 feet high and were quickly put out. But there was no sign of an aircraft down, nor was there any impact heard or felt. There was also no apparent cause for the fire. While the group stopped at the site, another motorist who saw the object descend and then the fire, continued down the road and phoned the 911 emergency dispatch center about the possible airplane crash. By the time the fire department arrived, the fire was just smoldering, and the motorists had continued on their way, now puzzled by 16 what they had seen. It wasn't until early the next morning that our (PASU) Pennsyl- vania Association for the Study of the Unexplained UFO Hotline began to ring with calls from various people who had been involved in the situation the night before, and who now felt that what they had observed could not have been a conventional aircraft. When it was learned that there was possible physical evidence connected with the sighting, our PASU PRT unit (phenomena response team which is on 24-hour call) was sent immediately to New Stanton to conduct an on-scene examination of the burnt area. The team photographed the site, took radiation readings, measured the burnt areas, and obtained samples for laboratory study. In the days to follow, PASU received many other calls from residents in the same vicinity who had seen a strange aerial object in the approximate 10 mile area between New Stanton and Connellsville. Some of the witnesses only saw strange multiple lights from a distance, while others observed the object when it was only a couple of hundred feet off the ground. PASU field investigators began to track down witnesses and after considerable research we have been able to put together the following sequence of events. Apparently the first sighting of the object was reported from Connellsville. The object came from the direction of Uniontown, and was moving toward Connellsville. A businessman and a friend were sitting outside on the sundeck when they noticed a strange object moving slowly and dropping in altitude as it followed along the river. The object continued to move in a wobbling manner and descended until it was only about 100 feet above the ground. The object was round and solid appearing, with many yellow lights around it. The object continued moving towards the direction of New Stanton. Two men in a car had just come off the Mt. Pleasant exit onto new Route 119 South, and as they moved a short distance down the road a large object passed directly over their vehicle from left to right. The object was elongated and solid in appearance, and made no sound as it passed over the car only about 150 feet in the air. The overall size of the object appeared to be about 70 feet long. The object had bright lights on its surface. It was at this location that .the object appeared to have moved toward the West, then made a wide circle back toward the East. Up the road a short distance motorists observed the object near the Volkswagen plant. The multi-lighted object was seen here as it began to descend Eastward at a very low altitude giving the impression it was going to crash. The many witnesses whom we interviewed along this stretch of the road all gave us very similar accounts. The best witness we were able to track down is an FAA Air traffic controller with 16 years experience. EMERALD LIGHTS , He is employed out of state and was passing through this area on a holiday trip. He had seen the object and notified local authorities about the possible crash. I now quote from his written statement to PASU. \"While traveling Westbound on Route 119 with my wife and two nephews, we saw a double row cluster of bright emerald green lights suddenly appear in front of us above the hills about 2 miles distance. The object was descending toward the East at a fast speed (but not faster than normal jet aircraft speed). Because of darkness, no discernible shape was noted, sighting time was about 4 seconds before object disappeared below hill. After our car traveled around the hills on the (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"TRACE, Continued highway, and into the area where the object would have been, we noted 2 cars stopped, and on the hill (right side of the road) 2 men were putting out a fire. They said they saw the same object but it had a definite round shape, and the fire started after their sightings while they were traveling Westbound on the highway. \"After I helped put out the fire, I looked around on top of the hill for possible downed aircraft, but nothing was found. The object we saw had definite characteristics of a flying controlled vehicle. No high-voltage arcing from power lines, fireworks, flares or rockets could have produced the visual presentation of this sighting. The object appeared to have a double row'of bright emerald green lights, 8 to 12 in number. The. lighting pattern made it appear to be quite a large aircraft\". Other 'observers closer to the vicinity of the fire stated that the object was only a couple hundred feet off the ground when it was last seen. But other witnesses on the Hunker side of old Rt. 119 which is on the other side of the hill from where the fire was, got a closer look at the object as it made its Eastward approach. Several people were taking their nightly walk when they were startled to see a large object descend from an'altitude of about 1,000 feet, and continue to drop altitude until it appeared to land in the direction of the Volkswagen plant. From their vantage point, this would have placed the object near the spot where the fire was located. The object was observed long enough to see some details. The • object was round, about 50-feet in diameter, and a definite dome-top was observed. There were numerous yellowish-green lights that were steady and non-blinking. These lights were much larger in size than that of normal aircraft navigation lighting. These witnesses were so amazed at what they saw that they got into a car and searched the fields in the vicinity where they thought it descended, but they could not locate it. At this point the object was reported to again have moved South back towards the Uniontown area. We feel that a number of responsible observers did in fact see an object that at this time remains unidentified. There is no definite way that we can link the fire with the appearance of the object. However, it seems more than coincidence that travelers unknown to each other would stop their cars to put out a fire that they connected at first with a possible airplane crash. The fire apparently had not been present prior to this incident. PASU submitted samples from the burnt area to a laboratory to try to determine what caused the fire. The tests indicated that there appeared to be pieces of a magnesium flare in the sample. We have no idea how this relates to the case. Possibly a motorist who saw the possible crash and fire later returned to the location after the others had gone. We can speculate that he carried a flare with him for safety and lighting, and when he got up to the smoldering area and saw that it was safe, he threw the flare into the burnt spot. Some witnesses who were at the fire site commented to us that they thought it was strange that only that one small area was on fire, since the grass and weeds in the immediate area' were mostly green. It should also be noted, that the object descended very low near two 138 KV. high-tension power towers that feed electricity to the Volkswagen plant. This UFO sighting took place during a wave of UFO incidents that have continued all summer through sections of Pennsylvania. VALLEE, Continued truly took place and are not delusions of the mind or any sort of psychological problem. I feel much of his belief is based on the scars the abductees sometimes incur during their ordeals, photos of which appear in Missing Time. (Cr. Mr. Lindy Whitehurst, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.) 2) The Invisible College by Jacques Vallee. 1975. E.P. Dutton & Co. Inc. (U.S.A.).

And/Or Press, Berkeley, California, U.S.A. 4) Apparently the Peruvian government is not happy with the popular image that extraterrestrials had a hand in building their famous archaeological ruins. A Reuter news report relates that a Shirley MacLaine movie being filmed in Peru has been re-written under pressure from the government to delete references to extraterrestrials having built the mysterious archaeological ruins at Machu Picchu. Peruvian cultural officials branded the references a national insult and ordered filming stopped until the.script was reworked. \"To say extraterrestrial beings built Machu Picchu is a great offence to the country because with this they mean to affirm South Americans were not capable of building a. site of- such magnitude,\" said Oscar Nunez, director of the National Cultural Institute in the city of Cuzco. (Taken from \"The Edmonton Sunday Sun,\" Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 23 February, 1986. Cr. Mr. John ,Brent Musgrave, Edmonton, Alberta.) 5) My question concerns Dr. Vallee's belief, stated in Messengers of Deception, that UFOs and their occupants are the product of a group of human beings rather than extraterrestrials. Just what sort of human being was he thinking of here? Surely not the orthodox human race. Was he thinking (but could not put into print) of descendants, perhaps, from a highly evolved civilization of long ago that collapsed, and who have since lived on Earth but apart from the human race? , I do not recall any specific reference being made to these human manipulators during the lecture although it is possible Dr. Vallee was hinting in this direction when, after stating that \"there is a better explanation for UFOs than extraterrestrials,\" he spoke of the great diversity of life that had evolved over untold millions of years on Earth. , MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

As Chairman of the International Committee for UFO Research (ICUR), Bertil Kuhlemann has scheduled their annual meeting to be held oh July 9, just prior and in conjunction with the BUFORA Congress. Since it is very difficult for MUFON representatives and members in Europe to attend our MUFON UFO Symposiums in North America, a special one day conference is planned for Monday, July 13, 1987 in London immediately following the BUFORA Congres, probably at the same location. It will be an informal get- acquainted, and a working session. All Foreign Representatives or. their designated representative will report on their National organizational activities and the major UFO sighting investigations conducted within the past 2 to 3 years. One of the major goals will be improved communications and greater cooperation between nations. A European Continental Coordinator will be selected to coordinate the programs initiated at this meeting. This advanced preliminary notice is being given so that vacation time may be scheduled for those interested in attending. Walt Andrus, International Director, has made plans to attend all three meetings. I am looking forward to meeting many of our foreign representatives in person. The July 13th meeting is open to MUFON members anywhere in the World and not confined to Europe. Paul Norman, State Director for Victoria, Australia originally proposed this meeting and plans to attend. Preliminary details were worked out with Bertil Kuhlemann during two telephone calls that he made from Stockholm, Sweden. Members interested in attending the July 13th meeting should so advise in their next correspondence with headquarters in Seguin, Texas. Having both the ICUR and MUFON meeting in conjunction with the BUFORA (British UFO Research Association) Congress will benefit attendance for all sessions. * * * MUFON has ordered 100 more 18 copies of the outstanding paperback book CLEAR INTENT by Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J.

PROTOCOL, Continued exposure to UFO activity; however we know this rarely happens. If the physican can see this individual within the first week or sooner, valuable first hand data could still be collected. I also recommend a follow-up psychological screening within the first month. If any investigators in the UFO research field have any information of any witnesses/patients that have received an examination/treatment over the past 5 years, including photographs of medical injuries, the author would appreciate following up with the physicians on these cases. UFO-M.D., which was visualized by Dr. Richard Niemtzow, produced only 2 cases from Oct. 1,1981 to Oct. 1, 1983. His objective was to study at least 12 cases of medical injuries associated with alleged UFO close encounters. It is clear that some type of national screening network is sorely needed for referral of cases. As physicians, we are extremely frustrated because so many potentially good cases are lost due to lack of a referral system. Referral or sharing of information at this time would be greatly appreciated. Please submit inquiries to: Richard M. Neal, Jr., M.D., 4193 W. Redondo Beach Bvd., Suite A, Lawndale, CA 90260. UFOLOGY, Continued #12. Such civilizations will not permanently go extinct once arisen. This has been the \"bone of contention.\" My view of this is as follows: A.) Some such civilized species may indeed go extinct due to an environmental catastrophe beyond their current capacity to control, eliminate, adjust to. An example would be a massive collision or a close-encounter with a supernova or a black hole. Such events will be rare. B.) Other civilizations may extinct themselves. This is very difficult to conjecture upon. Unlike all the other assumptions, science doesn't give us much to go on here. We're left . with intuitions. My intuition, for what it's worth, is that such extinction almost never happens. Why? Intelligent tool- users are incredibly adaptable. The self-imposed catastophe would have to be almost unimaginably sudden and powerful. Once the hi-tech ETIs are space-born, it becomes almost impossible to engineer a single- thrust eradication of their (then) multiple ecospheres. And, I'm a romantic. I think that the good people will ultimately drag the animals into the future to face their destiny. C.)

The crescent Moon passes Jupiter on the 1st and Mars two nights later. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): The most brilliant planet of all, Venus, rises soon after 4 AM in midmonth and outshines Saturn in the SE by nearly 80 times. Saturn, glowing at magnitude +0.5 in Ophiuchus, rises about l l / 2 hours before Venus on February 15. The ringed world lies to the upper right of its bright neighbor.

Moving clockwise from Sirius, one can easily pick out the other members of the Circle; Procyon in the constellation Canis Minor the Little Dog, Pollux and Castor in Gemini the Twins, Capella in Auriga the Charioteer, Aldebaran in Taurus the Bull, and Rigel in Orion the Hunter. Orion, the winter sky symbol, dominates the southern part of the sky. The two bright stars of nighttime lie one above the other separated by only 37°. The bottom star Canopus, second brightest star after Sirius, can be seen only from southern latitudes in the U.S. at this time of the year.

In my view, any way you look at it, the life-bearing systems are pumping out technological species at about one new one every ten years. IMPLICATIONS FOR UFOLOGY I suppose that these are obvious, but here's a short list: 1. There's a lot of Intelligent life out there; 2. Some of it is immensely old; 3. On average we could have a \"neighbor\" who originated within 50 light years, and 9 within 100; 4. Since they haven't destroyed themselves, they've probably \"got their act together\" if they're very old; 5. They might, however, be so advanced as to be practically unrecognizable in any sense whatever. REFERENCES 1. Asimov, Isaac. Extraterrestrial Civilzations. New York, 1979. 2. Billingham, J. (editor).
