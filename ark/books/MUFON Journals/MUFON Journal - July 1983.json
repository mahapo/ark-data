FROM THE EDITOR Due to various factors, including the lack of current well- attested sightings and the effective, debunking of UFOs by — the debunkers, this is a period of reorganization, of falling back and regrouping, by those of us who are persuaded that the phenomenon or phenomena represents something of potentially extraordinary significance. Exactly why UFOs are not taken seriously by people who count should be a matter of primary interest to us. Yet, many \"pro-UFO\" advocates don't wish to confront this problem and, apparently, prefer to ignore the impediments to acceptance of UFOs as a genuine scientific problem, hoping they will go away. .They won't unless we address them directly and make a convincing case on the merits of the evidence.

Theme of the Symposium was \"UFOs: A Scientific Challenge.\" The first speaker on Saturday was Richard Haines, a research psychologist at NASA Ames Research Center specializing in the field of human perception. Haines is the author of Observing UFOs, which is not a how-to book but a detailed description of how we perceive objects in space and time and how our own physiology sometimes causes errors in judgment. Reflecting his ongoing interest in the UFO phenomenon, Haines spoke about \"Selected Aerial Phenomenon Sightings From Aircraft — 1942 to 1952.\" For that period, Haines has collected a total of 283 cases involving an aircrew and an unidentified aerial phenomenon. Twenty-four of these involved some form of electromagnetic response or disturbance, which Haines broke down into the following categories: (1) Aircraft Radar Contact only, with no visual sightings; (2) Aircraft and Ground Radar Contact only, with no visual sighting; (3) Aircraft Radar Contact and Visual Contact by Aircrew; (4) Ground Radar and Visual Contact by Aircrew; (5) Aircraft Engine Stopped while in-flight; (6) Aircraft Engine Trouble; and (7) Aircraft Radio Transmission Jamming. From category 3 Haines recited a typical case which occurred in September of 1950. \"The pilot of a U.S. Navy night combat fighter aircraft reported seeing two huge shadows travelling over the ground below him at a high rate of speed. He was flying at 10,000 feet altitude just before sunrise and estimated the shadows were moving about 1,000 m.p.h. \"Then they both stopped suddenly and backed up and appeared to vibrate or jitter. He looked up and saw two apparently solid objects with a silver, mirror surface above him. He readied his guns and his radar screen became very bright, indicating some form of jamming. Turning down the set's sensitivity had no effect. \"When he tried to radio his ship a strange buzzing noise was heard. He stated, 'Each time I switched frequencies the band was clear for a moment, then the buzzing began.' Using the radar screen's initial size image and indicated range as indicators, he judged their diameters to be at least 600 to 700 feet. \"Both were described as looking like a coolie's hat with oblong portals emitting copper-green light which gradually shifted to pale pastel colors. A shimmering red ring encircled the top portion of each object. A jet black circle was also seen on the bottom of each object. During the entire period when the objects seemed to jitter the black circle appeared to remain stationary.\" Haines said a very similar sighting which he personally investigated took place July 4,1981, over Lake Michigan. It was reported by the aircrew of a commercial airliner, the main eyewitness of which was an ex-Navy fighter pilot with combat experience in Korea. In another incident contact was first established by ground radar and then confirmed by aircrew visual sighting. On May 26, 1952, the crew of an F-94 interceptor over North Korea were informed by ground radar that they had an unidentified on their tail. Said Haines, \"After making a 180 degree turn the onboard radar operator locked onto an object at 7,000 yards range. As the separation range diminished both crew members saw a 'brilliant white light straight ahead.' It then performed a steady climbing turn and 'accelerated at a tremendous speed, drawing away from the F-94 which now had cut in its after-burner.' Radar contact was lost after 15 seconds. A later equipment check found the radar system to be in perfect condition.\" Still, noted Haines, the official U.S. Air Force conclusion was. \"Possible malfunction of airborne radar set.\" On the 24th of July, 1949, said Haines, \"the pilot of an American Piper Clipper aircraft flying at 19,000 feet reported being passed by two rows of three objects, each flying in perfect formation with a seventh object slightly to the rear of the others. When they passed they turned right about 1,500 feet ahead and 500 feet below. his aircraft. Then they turned right again and passed his right side at a velocity estimated to be from 450 to 500 m.p.h. They were all the same shape with a delta-shaped wing and a dark colored circle about 12 feet in diameter located midway between the tips of the object. \"Its top surface was perfectly flat and a shallow dome was seen on top about 2 to 5 feet high. Each object had a needle-sharp nose and a flat tail. Some type of outer panels seemed to oscillate. They disappeared from full view suddenly. The wing span was 35 to 55 feet. They had no visible means of propulsion. \"As the pilot flew through the objects' flight path he expected some turbulence, but there' was none. His Lycoming 4 cylinder opposed engine was brand new but began to malfunction at this time. Upon landing a mechanic found all four spark plugs to have been shorted and burned out.\" The.reasons, Haines explained, for his concentrating on aircrew cases were partly obvious. For one thing, most pilots and crewmen were trained observers, which should lend their sightings credibility. Secondly, the (continued on next pagej"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Symposium, Continued 'airplane itself, carrying., radar, radio, and other sensitive electrical equipment, represents a sort of flying, instrumented laboratory, providing objective data about the phenomenon in question. Thirdly, the relatively.high altitude at which ' most airplanes operate automatically eliminates a number of prosaic explanations such as birds, kites, balloons, and radio- controlled flying models. \"Basically,\" concluded Hainesi \"the nature of the phenomenon (phenomena?) seen- by an aircrew'is remarkably similar to that reported by ground witnesses who represent an extremely wide range of occupations.\" Straight-Line Mystery? What about the flight path of UFOs, as seen from the ground, asked Ann Druffel of Pasadena? Druffel, a MUFON UFO Journal columnist, and co-author (with D. Scott Ro'go) of The Tujunga Canyon Contacts, admitted she was not the first to have asked the question. As long ago as 1958, the distinguished French UFOlogist, Aime Michel, had written an entire book devoted to the theory that UFOs tended to fly along survey-like straight lines, as if they were mapping out a grid work of the planet earth. Michel purblished the results of his studies in Flying Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery (1958), and even coined a new word for the occasion, orthoteny, which comes from the Greek adjective \"orthoteneis,\" meaning \"stretched in a straight line.\" Since the publication of Michel's book, orthoteny has remained a controversial subject within the UFO community. Some researchers, such as Jacques Vallee, have done work which seems to support the theory.. Others have contended that the data may be contaminated by population densities and other factors, known and unknown. Recently, the theory has been associated in the minds of some investigators with England's \"Ley lines,\" ancient footpaths and other geographical markings which seem to link historically sacred places of power 4 Dr. Richard M. Meal, Jr. with one another in readily observable straight lines. The Dragon Paths of ancient China, while hardly as straight and narrow as the ley lines of England, .seem to represent a similar preoccupation with the flow of earth energy. And as below, perhaps so above? To try to find out, Mrs. Druffel analyzed 57 high-strangeness cases which originated in her local southern California area. For comparison purposes, Druffel also plotted four traditional Indian sites of ceremonial interest. Other control groups of data were also used and Michel's basic mathematical approach employed to analyze the results. Since any two points on a map can be connected by a straight line, and a third point on the same line is not statistically surprising, said Druffel, \"the criterion for UFOlogical significance was four or more sites of UFO significance lying in a straight line across the map.\" In all, she discovered 16 lines comprised of four or more points. Seven had only the minimum number of points which would indicate some significance, but two lines had as many as seven points in succession. Four lines had six points and three lines had five points. Somewhat to her surprise, Druffel also found straight line corres- pondences among the control groups, which included 17 reports of high strangeness paranormal events and 14 IFOs, or identified flying objects. Of the latter control group Druffel said, \"These were all objects, in close proximity to the reporting witnesses, which were first perceived as UFOs but later proven to be misidentified conventional objects.\" In addition, three of the ancient Indian ceremonial sites also proved to be on a straight line. Of 92 targets, then, 91 were interrelated by some as yet unknown factor, a finding far above what would be expected from coincidence. But to test her results Druffel constructed artificial lines by scattering popcorn seeds over another map. Only six randomly formed \"orthotenic\" lines were found: one of six points, one of five, and four of four points. \"I speculate,\" said Druffel, \"that the hypothetical energy apparently emanating along orthotenic and ley lines might be gravitic in nature. It is further speculated that UFO sightings (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Symposium, Continued and other unusual events associated with these 'lines of energy' might manifest at times of greater gravitational pull, due for example, to the closer passages of Mars and the influence of other astronomical bodies in their closer conjunctions with the earth.\" Deception and Confusion Saturday afternoon Paul Cerny addressed the Symposium on the subject of \"The Continuing UFO Deception and Confusion Syndrome.\" Cerriy is Western Regional Director for MUFON and a field investigator for CUFOS, the Center for UFO Studies. There is no doubt the public is confused about the UFO phenomenon, said Cerny, and that should be a matter of concern to all serious researchers. \"On the one hand we have what might be called the \"far-out\" faction, composed largely of crackpots, cultists, contactees, and outright charlatans. At the other end of the spectrum lies an equally active body of debunkers. Too often their own work seems to consist not so much of constructive criticism as of distortion, the twisting of factual evidence, Vand what in some cases amounts to character assasination. The debunkers thrive on a policy of discrediting' researchers with flimsy, excuses'and absurd explanations, from which even the statements of an ex- President are not immune.\" The problem is further complicated, Cerny, said,-rby U.S. government. and military attitudes toward the UFO phenomenon which result in public ridicule or private pressure of witnesses. At the same time, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) indicate that most intelligence agencies still take an active interest in the subject. Those most greatly affected by a policy of ridicule or active intimidation, noted Cerny, are the large numbers of military personnel who are customarily muzzled in the interest of \"national security.\" Cerny gave several examples of military cases in which information was delayed or only relayed anonymously, usually because of a fear that the participants were somehow being \"un-patriotic\" by speaking out. As a result of a California radio talk show, Cerny received a telephone call from the widow of a U.S. Air Force pilot, Major Robert J. Waste. \"She said she had remained silent for many years, as requested,\" said Cerny, \"but now felt the public had a right to know about her husband's exceptional UFO encounter.\"  . The incident occurred on September 3, 1954. Waste, a bombadier-navigator, was aboard a B- 47 bomber, taking part in bombrun exercises with two other similar aircraft. About 4:30 p.m. they received a call from Carswell Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas, asking them to be on the lookout for and to investigate a suspected UFO. They were cruising at 25,000 feet in relatively clear skies. They were abruptly startled to discover the UFO hovering only 100 feet above the cockpit of their plane. Major Waste's widow described the object as a highly streamlined, missile- shaped aircraft, slightly larger and longer than the fuselage of her husband's B-47. It was said to be metallic silver in color, with two rows of oval-shaped portholes along either side and trailing a long orange \"tail.\" After a series of almost unbelievable manuevers over a period of an hour, during which time the object paced and circled the B-47,, it finally shot straight up and disappeared. But not before Waste and another crewman had taken pictures of the object with their personal cameras. Upon landing at Barksdale AFB near Shreveport, Louisiana, however, their film was immediately confiscated, according to Mrs. Waste. Waste and his crew, along with the crew of the other two, B-47s in the exercise were held incommunicado on the base for a period of three days, kept even from their families. Said Cerny, \"They were specifically instructed not to discuss military matters or incidents that took place on duty with anyone, even their, wives.\" Later, however, Major Waste told his wife what had happened and she held the secret for almost 20 years until hearing Cerny on the talk show. Attempts to follow up the investigation, according to Cerny, were thwarted by trie reluctance of the other surviving witness to discuss the case. \"Obviously, the military stranglehold on UFO percipients extends even to those no longer on active duty,\" concluded Cerny. UFO Propulsion How do UFOs manage such fantastic maneuvers like those cited by Cerny in the case above? Moreover, if UFOs do originate in distant star systems, as some researchers have proposed, how do. they manage to bridge the vast distances involved? Alan Holt, MUFON member and astrophysicist at NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, has been pondering those same questions for a number of years now. In a talk entitled \"UFO Propulsion: Pulsed Radiation and Crystalline Structure,\" Holt proposed a theoretical mechanism whereby UFOs might ' seemingly 'violate the bounds \"of \"normal\" physics. \"Some. of. the more intriguing phenomena associated with UFO close encounters are the . frequent observations .of pulsating lights and rotating lights,\"\" said Holt. \"In some cases the pulsating lights are also accompanied by humming or buzzing sounds. In a few cases a correlation was noted between the acceleration of the UFO and an increase in the pitch of the humming sound. \"These observations have led researchers to suspect that the pulsating lights and' sound waves could. be significant clues to the design and functioning of UFO propulsion systems. Because UFOs frequently disrupt electrical systems, it has been suggested that they may be generating very powerful magnetic fields. Such a field could be used to react against the earth's own magnetic field, or against a UFO-induced background magnetic field. Or do UFOs use pulsating magnetic fields to interact with and modulate Earth's gravitational field to hover and accelerate?\" Theoretical physicists, Holt noted, (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Symposium, Continued have been looking at gravity and magnetism for about a hundred years in hops of discovering some underlying relationship that would allow the manipulation of both forces. As an admitted theoretical exercise, Holt proposed that planets and star systems may have unique magnetic fields characterized by individual frequencies \" and properties, a sort of signature, as it were. Individual signatures may be carried or imposed upon a sort of background of hyperspace. A starship near the earth, then, could modulate its own magnetic field by pulsed radiation to emulate that of its origin, say, Alpha Centauri. At that point, the field, containing the starship, through a tunneling process, would vanish locally 'and travel through hyperspace to the other magnetic field signature. To those less advanced, such a technology, in the words of Arthur C. Clark, would seem more like magic or witchcraft than science. Holt assumes that there is a certain resonance to hyperspace itself, and that to take advantage of that resonance, pulsed radiation acting upon highly crystalline structures would be required. He is the first to suggest that such a technology does not yet exist — at least on earth — but he is also one of the first to suggest that studies in UFO propulsion mechanisms may just lead to such a breakthrough. Further evidence that UFOs may manifest magnetic field disruptions was provided by James M. McCampbell in his talk, \"UFO Interference With Vehicles and Self-Starting Engines.\" McCampbell, a former physicist now in private business, is the author of Ufology and numerous artrcles pertaining to UFO characteristics. Referring to several recent studies of UFO-vehicle interference cases, McCampbell noted that most cases fall into one of three categories: (1) Engine Disruption and Failure, in which an engine begins running roughly in the presence of a UFO and may resume normal operation after the stimulus is removed, or die altogether; (2) Failure to Restart, in which instance the engine dies in the presence of the UFO and cannot be restarted until after the UFO has departed; (3) Self-Starts, in which cases the engine seems to spontaneously restart itself without any assistance from the operator as soon as the UFO leaves the scene, or shortly thereafter. McCampbell proposed the theory \"that the proximate cause of engine failure in the above cases is ionization of the atmosphere,\" further explaining that \"ionization is the process by which electrons become detached from their parent atoms, leaving as separate particles the electron itself and the positively charged remnant of the atom which is known as an ion.\" McCampbell summarized one particularly important case in which the UFO was seen approaching the car by mimicking a series of flashlight signals. \"The car radio started to be affected and the engine faltered, the interior of the car became very hot and the engine failed completely. The driver got out of the car, noted that the object was directly overhead, and felt a prickling sensation like small electric shocks. He lifted the car hood and asked his wife to try to start the engine. \"The engine turned over, but sparks were seen to jump from the plug leads across the coil to the metal side of the car and back again. The man was a master mechanic and had never seen such an effect before. As another vehicle approached, the object moved away at high speed. The car engine could then be started immediately.\" McCampbell noted that the points in a car which are located in the distributor cap serve to break the electrical surge coming out of the battery. If the atmosphere across this gap is highly charged itself, however, as it would be under ionization, then the charge would tend to ground itself out, resulting in sporadic engine failure as the plugs failed to receive the proper voltage. \"The most exasperating aspect of engine interference cases,\" McCampbell continued, \"is the claim that an engine started by itself when the UFO departed, even though the driver's efforts were futile when it was nearby. This is such a ridiculous notion that even trained mechanics scoff at it. Others find it an impossible concept. Yet it has happened, if witnesses are to Bill Moore be believed at all.\" McCampbell thinks that such a curious scenario could be achieved if one of'the engine's cylinders stopped almost at the top of its path of travel. A mixture of gasoline and air would still be trapped under compression. If the UFO departed suddenly, the ionized field interrupting the electrical flow would quickly collapse, and voltage would surge across the point gap, thereby firing and restarting the engine. Case Against E.T. Hynek's talk, \"The Case Against E.T.,\" showed not only how a leading proponent of the significance of UFOs can adjust his thinking as new data becomes available, but also how a Symposium, such as MUFON's, can accomodate a variety of expression and opinion as to the ultimate meaning of the UFO phenomenon. Hynek, former consultant to the Air Force's Project Blue Book, is easily the most visible figure today when it comes to the subject of UFOs. Unfortunately, other problems of public visibility, especially the movies \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"E.T.,\" have inadvertantly resulted in roadblocks for the serious UFO investigator. \"The movies,\" Hynek noted, \"have done both a service and disservice for UFOlogy.\" On one hand they did away with the myth of hostile aliens from outer space, said Hynek, but on the other hand, they replaced it with a newer myth, the conception of aliens as friendly extraterrestrials who have (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I 1, fi Symposium, Continued crossed astronomical distances to make contact with mankind. \"By what manner they have accomplished this,\" Hynek wondered, \"is largely left to the imagination which, generally, does not have access to the brutal facts of astronomy, nor of Einsteinian Relativity.\" Hynek argued that there are at least seven points which appear to augur ill for the ExtraTerrestrial Hypothesis (ETH). First, there is the failure of sophisticated surveillance systems to detect incoming or outgoing UFOs. Second is the problem that the \"extraterrestrials\" seem to have no difficulty with either our atmosphere or the earth's gravity. Third, said Hynek, is the sheer statistical consideration of the numbers of aliens alleged to have visited our planet, a situation Hynek likened to our launching an Apollo space probe every half hour! Fourth, noted Hynek, there is the elusive and absurd behavior of UFOs and their alleged occupants. Another factor is the apparent isolation of the UFO phenomenon in space and time, what Hynek calls the \"Cheshire Cat Effect,\" after the character in \"Alice in Wonderland\" who appeared sometimes as only a smile or a tail, and sometimes not at all. \"The UFO appears spontaneous- ly,\" said Hynek, \"remains visible for a short while, and then like that remarkable cat, is gone.. .but where to? The UFO seems to have a dual existence: physical at one moment, non-physical at .the next.\" Sixth, Hynek considered what he called \"the space 'unworthiness' of the UFO.\" Things must be a little cramped aboard the average UFO, he speculated. Where is the room for supplies and equipment needed for a journey that might last years? To answer that question satisfactorily, he noted, ETH proponents call in the presence of a \"Mother Ship.\" Lastly, Hynek said, are the great astronomical distances that must be traversed between one solar system and another. \"Let us represent the actual distance that man has traveled in space, from the earth to the moon, by the thickness of one ordinary playing card. How many such cards must be placed back to back to represent the distance to Alpha Centauri, the nearest star to our solar system? The answer: Nineteen miles of cards! \"Even if one were to build such a model by putting down cards at the rate of two per second, working a full eight hour day, it would take nine regular work years to finish the job! \"There is nothing in our present or forseeable technology that gives us any clue as to how these distances can be traversed in any reasonable time,\" said Hynek. \"However,\" he concluded, \"even if we grant that all the arguments in the case against E.T. are valid. . .all these arguments do not in one iota negate the reality of the UFO phenomenon. It is the persistence of the UFO reports, and the contents of those reports, that constitute the UFO Phenomenon; it is this Phenomenon that must be studied and its validity judged independently of any hypothesis of its origin. To do otherwise is simply not honest science..\" Government Cover-Up Aside from Dr. Hynek and Jacques Vallee, William L. Moore is probably one of the world's more widely known and respected UFO investigators. Certainly, he is one of the most vocal and one of the few able to devote full-time research to the phenomenon. He is co-author, with Charles Berlitz, of The Philadelphia Experiment and The Roswell Incident. In his talk, \"UFOs: Uncovering the Ultimate Answer,\" Moore went straight to the point: \"Evidence that at least some UFOs are someone else's spaceships and that our planet is currently being visited by craft from another world, has been accumulating in the hands of private UFO researchers for many years. Only recently, however, have strong indications begun to develop that the American government appears to have come to such a conclusion as early as 1947, and indeed that the present policy of denying any interest or involvement with UFOs is a direct result of a highly classified national security policy Idabel Epperson: Honored by Dedication of Symposium Proceedings developed at a high level apparently not later than 1953. \"It is the opinion of the author,\" said Moore, \"that such a situation constitutes what has appropriately come to be called a \"Cosmic Watergate\" of such tremendous proportions that when the truth is finally made public, our nation, and in fact our world, will undergo dramatic change. It is also my opinion that such a cosmic awareness will ultimately prove beneficial to our planet.\" One of the arguments against such a theory, Moore noted, was the widespread belief that the American government and its complex of intelligence agencies couldn't keep a secret even if they wanted to. Considering, said Moore, that some of the secrets that do get leaked are done so for the government's own propaganda purposes, the amount of classifed data that does become public knowledge is a small percentage of that that doesn't. . By way of example, Moore cited a balloon-reconnaisance project of the Soviet Union, conducted during the early 1950s, that is still classified. In addition, there is the curious problem of Blue Book Report #13, which was either never made, or according to Moore, never made public. Beginning in 1949, and at three month intervals, Air Force Project Blue Book regularly published a series of reports. Reports 1 through 12 appeared on schedule, along with a (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"NORTHERN LIGHTS By Hilary Evans ' / seem to see lights in the distance - What is it that's glistening there? IBSEN: Peer Cynt , ,. Norwegian mythology is rich and varied, and could well prove as rich a source of pre-Arnold UFOlore as that of any other culture. The first major event in Norwegian UFOlogy, however; was the \"ghost-rocket\" wave of 1946, which remains to this day one of the most baffling enigmas in UFO history. From that time on Norway has had its share of incidents, with one or .two.,highlights,like the 1954 encounter of two sisters with an alien entity while . out picking berries, and'a curious case in which a car temporarily changed color after a close encounter with a low-., flying UFO. But for the most part the cases have been typical of those seen around the world — instances ' of anomalous lights which are convincingly puzzling but contain little Symposium, Continued Special Report 1, indicating that at least two classifications of documents were involved., Report 13 failed to appear, however; in its place the public was given Special Report 14 instead. \"The truth of the matter, revealed here for the first time,\" said Moore, \"is that the real Project STORK (SECRET) report was Number 13, and u;as issued on schedule in December 1953. The document, however, proved to be quite a problem for Air Force Intelligence in that the Battelle Foundation scientists, essentially civilians who were governed by the dictates of data and not the requirements of Air Force policy, had concluded from their study of over 3,000 cases, that UFOs were real, and that there was a high probability that they did represent a technology vastly superior to our own. Concerned about what might happen if such a document fell into the wrong hands, the report was immediately classified Top Secret and was not even made available to Blue Book personnel, who were told that there had been a delay in completing the report.\" To conclude, said Moore, \"Virtually the entire history of civilian UFO investigations has been devoted to trying to establish the reality of a highly elusive phenomenon. In my humble opinion^ there is no more \"if.\" The evidence is in. Flying saucers are real. 8 \"The question now becomes .where do we, as presumed experts on. the subject, go from here? Once the reality of extraterrestrial visitation, is no longer in question, what is our role then? If UFOlogy'is to survive, then it is my':urgent suggestion that we:.stop ' looking for old answers and begin looking for new ones.\" There was much more to this year's Symposium than a capsule report can hope to encompass. 1 Mention needs to be of Paul Norman's review of recent Australian cases, Peter Jordan's analysis of the psychological components and factors governing animal mutilation reports, and Dr. Richard M. Neal, Jr.'s, survey of the physical effects reported by close encounter witnesses. In addition; workshops were conducted on hypnosis, UFO' instrumentation, and propulsion systems. As the single most significant annual gathering of UFOlogists in this country, MUFON's symposia are to be congratulated for bringing together leading investigators and having those experts share their research with fellow researchers, MUFON members, and the public at large. And if the general quality of the 14th Symposium is any kind of reliable guideline, next year's conference, to be held in the Dallas- Fort Worth metroplex area, should be an event worth watching for. It's as close to the phenomenon itself as most of us are likely to come in a lifetime. for the, UFOlogist to grab hold of. Within, the last/two years all this has changed. The pattern of sightings in Norway has been transformed by not one but two clusters of sightings, centered on a specific location and sustained over a period of time — several weeks in one case, many months irr the other. This has given UFO investigators the chance to follow up their witness interrogation with field observation of their own, with results which may well make the names of Arendal and ' Hessdalen celebrated when the history of the solution of the UFO enigma comes to be written. There are obstacles to UFO investigation in Norway, as I discovered when I went there myself earlier this year to see, if not the UFOs themselves, then at least the places where others were seeing them. The mileometer of my car confirmed what the maps indicate: Norway is a vast place. (I don't think I met a single Norwegian who didn't at some moment point out to me that if his country could be rotated on its most southern point, his most northern compatriots would find themselves living on the banks of the Nile instead of deep within the Arctic Circle!) Not only is Norway vast, but it is sparsely populated — within that great area live fewer people than in many of the world's cities. So there is only a skeletal road network, and even that is further hampered by the terrain, as I discovered one day when I foolishly sought to cross a mountain pass which I assumed would have been cleared by late May, only to find that it was still blocked with snow. I was forced to make a detour measured in hundreds of miles. Under such conditions, UFO investigation would make severe demands on any UFO organization; and of course Norway's small numbers (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Northern Lights, Continued mean that its UFO organizations are also small in proportion.

During November 1981 many witnesses reported anomalous lights in the sky, inspiring UFO-Norge to set up regular surveillance. Their efforts were rewarded: they obtained 78 successful photos, of which 25 show complex light forms which are manifestly different from the photos of aircraft taken by way of control on the same spot on the same occasions by the same people with the same cameras. Though I am no kind of expert on photographic evidence, I have to say that the Arendal photos are among the most impressive I have ever seen. Not a hint of Adamski-type motherships and scouts, but a clear indication of something more complex than a simple light-in-the-sky. Witnesses reported structured shapes, but these do not show up in the photos: they do, however, suggest cylindrical forms surrounding the blinks of blue,\" orange, and green light. The Arendal photographs contain information which should be susceptible of analysis. Characteristic is a change in light intensity when the object changes direction; at each of a succession of 90° turns, for instance, the cameras record a big blast of light. It is inferred that this indicates a sudden outburst of energy, though this is not the only possible explanation. The descriptions and drawings supplied by the witnesses are, of course, considerably more sensational, if less useful from the scientific point of view. What is especially interesting, though, is that some of the objects were unusually low-flying: one of them was seen at a distance of 200-300 meters with a tree-covered island as a background, making possible a fair estimate of distance, size and speed. The object in this case was a cigar shape with an unusual light display, and making no sound. What is Happening in Hessdalen Hessdalen is totally unlike Arendal. It is a remote valley in the vast mainland interior of Norway, nearly 600 km from Arendal as the UFO flies and a great deal more as the Capri drives. (It is not only distance which separates one Norwegian from another, it is fjells, which tend to keep their snow covering all year round, and fjords, which are too big to be bridged and therefore have to be crossed by ferryboats which spend their lives chugging backwards and forwards in the world's most beautiful scenery.) About a hundred people live in Hessdalen, mostly in isolated farms along unmade-up (and how!) tracks. From a sociological point of view these people present a curious contrast with the peasant populations of, say, Sicily or Latin America; Norway has a very high standard of living and a full spectrum of social amenities such as education. So the people of Hessdalen are simple people living in a physical environment of stunning severity, yet with living standards of a comfort and convenience normally associated with gentler living conditions. I leave it to the sociologist to determine whether this somewhat paradoxical state of affairs may affect their credibility as UFO witnesses. For UFO witnesses is just what a surprising number of the people of Hessdalen claim to be. Since December 1981 — that is to say, and make of it what you will, commencing immediately after the Arendal sightings — hundreds of UFOs have been reported in the Hessdalen area by several dozen witnesses, several of them being multiple observations. The great majority were nocturnal lights, but a few were seen in daylight and these were all of metallic cigar-shaped objects. The sightings comprise a great variety: distances varied from 10-15 meters to several km; number of objects ranged from 1 to 4; movement varied from hovering to great speed and from a simple trajectory to complex maneuvers. Only one feature seems to have been constant — a total absence of sound. In this almost unbelievably isolated region, however, this feature 'takes on a special significance, for any sound such as that of a car or tractor can be heard at many kilometers distance. In another respect, too, the geography of Norway aids the UFO investigator: Hessdalen is far to the north, which means that in summer it stays lights most hours of the day and night. I stood on the mountaintop at Hessdalen at 11:30 p.m. taking photographs! Not, unfortunately, of UFOs, but that I hardly dared hope for: a Norwegian journalist, who has recently published a book on the Hessdalen 'sightings, spent seven weeks skywatching in Hessdalen before he had his first sighting. What the prolonged daylight means, though, is that there is a very long period of half-light which an enterprising photographer can exploit. If the UFO is good enough to stay still for a while, it is possible to obtain a photograph which includes some background, and indeed the UFO- Norge investigators were able to obtain at least two such photographs, in which the object is seen in front of the facing slopes. As at Arendal, the witness reports are considerably more exciting than the photographs. The farmer who owned the wooden hut where investigator Leif Havik and I spent the night, Lars Lillevold, saw an egg-shaped object hovering about 30 m from his house, and this is just one of the structured objects which Hessdalen residents have reported. These sightings have been confirmed by the investigators too, which is just one of the ways in which these incidents are of unique interest. Leif Havik has watched an oblong object passing slowly along the valley in front of the facing mountain; it was silent, and with a strange light configuration. He was lucky enough to obtain a photograph of his sighting, just one of many dozen photographs which, though they do not give much idea of shape or size, resist any interpretation (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Northern Lights, Continued in terms of conventional phenomena. Even if all witness testimony is set aside — which when there is so great a quantity of it would be a very high- handed course to take! — the photographs present clear evidence of some ,kind of. anomalous aerial phenomenon which is repeatedly manifesting : in the skies above Hessdalen. The Geophysical Dimension The country around Hessdalen is a geologist's dream: the land is stuffed full' of minerals of many'kinds, and copper mining»was at one time carried out nearby. The magnetic field is the strongest in the whole of Norway. These.; .features .can hardly be coincidental: but that does not mean that their significance is self-evident. They support the extraterrestrial hypothesis . as much as they do the \"earthlings\" hypothesis. If ,the witnesses are rea//y seeing structured objects with lights and windows, 'as so many of them claim, then we don't have much choice but to suppose that alien visitors are taking an interest in the region for reasons connected with its,. geological make-up. If we suppose that, however sincere, the eye-witnesses are being deluded, either by their own psychological processes or by induced external, forces of the .control-system type, then we can rely only on what the cameras reveal, which by no,means requires an extraterrestrial origin. At the same time, the phenomena, reported from Hessdalen manifest a degree of complexity which is a far cry from the earth-force-generated transient light phenomena hypo- thesised by Persinger, Devereux et al. Leif Havik and Arne Thomassen have .seen and photographed luminous • objects of massive size moving slowly across a distance of many kilometers, hovering and changing direction from time to time, and low enough for terrain to be seen behind the object. No object on the ground could move, that fast over such rugged terrain and great distances; no man-made aerial object could maneuver like that except a helicopter which could not conceivably 10 have gone unheard (apart from the fact that none of Norway's limited population of helicopters was in the area at the time). But no known natural phenomenon offers so complex, a form and conducts itself in so complex. a way over so great a distance and over so sustained a period of time. Manifestations of Intelligence Leif Havik: \"The main reason why I think the phenomena are under some control is this: five times I have seen a UFO just when I arrived at the mountain, and before I:had time to set 1 up my camera.'On all five occasions j was less than 100 m from where I meant to set up my observation position.\" None of us feels very comfortable with subjective impressions of this kind, but at the same time it would be intellectually dishonest to dismiss them. Readers of Rutledge's Project Identification will,of course be aware that comparable incidents occurred in the course of the Arherican research: Rutledge will surely derive some comfort from the fact that his controversial findings have been spontaneously replicated here in 'Norway.    • . Once again, it is a finding which can be interpreted different ways depending on the hypothesis you are evaluating. Those who are familiar with the \"BOLs\" hypothesis proposed by me last year in Probe Report may suspect that I am an interested party in this matter: yet I must insist that it is only with the utmost reluctance, and because I believe that we must go where the evidence leads us, that I feel we are obliged to take this evidence into account. That evidence, combined with the rest of the testimony, points towards a controlled, purposive, and intelligently-guided phenomenon, which we must ' 'suppose to be motivated in some way by the geophysical character of the Hessdalen area. (I . do not have sufficient information about the geology of the Arendal area to know whether the same holds good there too, but all of Norway seems to be as geologically as it is scenically striking!) Really, there is nothing unique about the Norwegian sightings except their t unusual disposition to keep on happening, thus enabling UFO investigators to collect their equipment and set up'observation posts. The only parallel known to me is the Rutledge project, and the two sets of sightings have much more in common. But just as Rutledge is skeptical of • any . reductionist geophysical explanation for his sightings, so the earthlights hypothesis will have to be substantially extended before it will even begin to fit the Arendal and Hessdalen sightings. At the same time, I-don't think anyone questions that at the basis of the Norwegian'sightings, as of the Missouri :,UFOs, there i's 1 .a fundamentally physical phenomenon. It may have other dimensions which differentiate it from other types of physical object, but that doesn't mean • the physical dimension isn't there. And since we UFOlogists are physical beings living in a, physical universe, it would seem only reasonable to approach these enigmatic phenomena on a physical level, as three- dimensional objects with mass and duration and.so on. The paraphysical aspects, if such there be, can come later. . . , ' REFERENCES The Arendal sightings were written up in the English-language Nordic UFO Newsletter 1982/2: the Hessdalen sightings will be given similar treatment in the next 1 issue. Those who read Scandinavian will find fuller accounts in UFO Norge's fine journal, confusingly named UFO. A book-length account of .the Hessdalen sightings (in Norwegian) has just been published by a freelance journalist, Ame Wisth: entitled UFO mysferief i Hessdalen, it is published by Bladkompaniet of Oslo. It includes many photographs, 17 in color. The other books referred to are, of course, Harley Rutledge's Project identification, essential reading if ever there was such a thing; and Paul Devereux' Ear(h/ings which also merits serious study. Persinger has published snippets of his work in obscure (so far as the average UFOlogist is concerned) academic journals; he has written a book embodying them but has hitherto failed to find a publisher. When it does;come out, it will — to judge by the chapters I have read — be essential reading for every one of us. If any reader is inspired by this to make a journey to Norway to see for himself, he will find it immensely rewarding; and I will be glad to share some preliminary advice which may ease some of the hazards of the experience!"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"AUSTRALIAN UPDATE By Keith Basterfield As of July 1983, it has been almost ,5 years since the disappearance of Melbourne pilot Frederick Valentich over Bass Strait. To date no one really knows for certain just what befell him on that fateful night of Oct. 21, 1978. A variety of stories circulated at the time of the disappearance, but as the months went by these became fewer and fewer. Only a few tantalizing press items periodically revive the story. I will present three such items which have appeared since 1978 as an update for readers: • In 1980 the discovery of three aluminum strips in the sea near Flinders Island with the numbers 266 and 466 painted on them led 'to the first \"the plane has been found\" report. Analysis revealed the metal was not from Valentich's aircraft. • 1982 brought the story of a group of Melbourne. businessmen who declared they were only weeks away from raising the plane, after finding it. The story related how an independent film producer, had seen actual photographs of the aircraft located under water, and that the world would, soon know the answer to the mystery. Later the pictures were said to be in the U.S.A. Exactly where, with whom, and for what purpose was not revealed. The story .died with no further evidence forthcoming. • Lastly, in June 1983 fishermen in Bass Strait dredged up a piece of wreckage from 27 fathoms deep, off Flinders Island. The object was 37 cm long, 20 cm deep, and 10 cm wide, painted orange and containing electrical components. Wide media speculation questioned whether or not it was a part of the missing plane. Analysis showed it to be part of a sonar buoy unrelated to the aircraft. To date no concrete evidence has emerged to tell us just what did occur on Oct. 21, 1978. Our own \"retrieval\" case? Not to be outdone by the American experience with tantalizing retrieval events, Australia may have produced one of its own. Certainly a story of one .exists. In September 1982 a Mr. Noel Martin, 32, of Wollongong NSW made nationwide news with an announce- ment that he was going to raise money for a venture to raise an object which he had personally seen crash into the sea in 1957. He related that his parents, an aunt, and three of his brothers and sisters, all viewed a fiery ball pass over them apparently under artificial control and fall into the sea. It was reported he had registered a company called \"UFO Recovery 82\" and' was looking for $250,000 (Aust.) for funds for the operation. ; , Nothing more was head of the venture until press reports in April 1983 quoted Mr. Martin as stating that a diving team had found the area where the UFO had disappeared. One item went on to say: \"I am convinced it's still there. It was a metallic object and was flying out of control when it crashed.\" It was hoped to locate parts of the object' within a week: As of July 1983 nothing further has been heard from the retrieval team. May 1983 UFO \"Flap\" Press clippings will by now have filtered around the,world revealing an apparent invasion of the state of Victoria by nocturnal lights. However, .in Tny opinion all is not what it seems. This author has reviewed some 60 press clippings, and transcripts of radio and television news items on the events of May 20-29, and the majority of events almost certainly have mundane causes. I hope our Victorian representative Paul Norman will shortly come forth with an indepth review of the \"flap\" for us all to read; The \"flap\" was largely ! 6f nocturnal light. observations, with' apparently spinning > lights changing colors, red/green/blue/white. Close reading of the information given revealed sky positions corresponding to various stars: The planets Jupiter and Venus were also misidentified. Media hype contributed greatly to the confusion. One Melbourne TV station took a film of one of these lights, which was later revealed to have been a star. All in all, in my opinion, a \"flap\" over nothing. EDITOR RESIGNS Richard Hall, editor of the MUFON UFO Journal for the past 6 years, has resigned due to personal and professional reasons. Citing the need for time to pursue other interests and to be relieved of excessive paperwork and correspondence, Hall said he would remain active in MUFON in some less demanding capacity. \"For the time being I intend to continue as Secretary-Treasurer of the Fund for UFO Research, as a Board Member of the North .American UFO Federation, and Associate Member of .the Center for UFO Studies,\" he said. \"But that, is already a heavy commitment and something else may have to give too.\" Hall said other professional opportunities had suffered as a result of his time-consuming UFO work, as have his recreational activities. His interests include gardening, houseplants, hiking, painting, and freelance writing. \"As it is,\" he said \"I have almost no time for anything except my job and UFOs. I am over-committed, and other things are equally important to me.\" Hall is the fourth Journal editor; his predecessors were Norma Short, Dwight Connelly, and Dennis Hauck. A search is underway for a replacement."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON-N.C. SYMPOSIUM By Richard Hall The 7th Annual MUFON of North Carolina UFO Symposium, sponsored by the Tarheel UFO Study Group, was held June 11-12 at the Nature Science Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. Master of Ceremonies was Rob Anderson. The conference took on an international flavor with the presence of Guillermo Aldunati from Argentina and Paul Norman from Australia. Both men reported on UFO sightings in their countries. Aldunati was touring the U.S. mainly to promote the World UFO Association (see last issue), an international federation of individuals as opposed to organizations. He is President-Founder of AOA Internation- al (1966) in Rosario, Argentina, and also is active in Federacion Argentina de Estudios de la Ciencia Extraterreste (F.A.E.C.E.). He gave an overview of Argentine and other South American sightings, including an incident at Deception Island, Antarctica in 1965 when scientific stations operated by Argentina, Chile, and England saw and photographed a large lens-shaped UFO. A very large sighting wave occurred in Argentina during 1968, he said, including many landing trace cases and entity reports. Paul Norman gave a similar overview of UFO events in Australia, including an update on the Frederick Valentich (pilot) disappearance case and newspaper headlines signalling a new flurry of sightings' just as he departed for his trip to the U.S. Pete Mazzola, Director of the Scientific Bureau of Investigation in New York City and Secretary of the newly formed North American UFO Federation, gave an illustrated slide presentation of recent SBI investigations, including a close encounter and apparent abduction case. Photographs provided by Dennis Beck and Gay/e McBride. 12 An examination of Government UFO documents was presented by Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, who also gave a separate talk in which he intensively analyzed one particularly significant frame from the 1978 New Zealand movie films. Dr. Willy Smith analyzed some additional South American cases, and Bernard Haugen continued his analysis of UFO-like technology in advanced or unusual configuration aircraft such as the F-15, SR-71, and the Harrier and analyzed aerial close encounter reports by pilots and aircrews. Wayne LaPorte, pinch-hitting for Henry Morton, reviewed UFO theories, including the geological fault theory; and George Fawcett rounded out the program with a humorous presentation on \"Humorous UFOs I Have Known.\" The program gave a particularly strong overview of UFO sightings and patterns worldwide, with less emphasis on speculation and theories.. The continuity of sightings and similarities of features across national and cultural boundaries was evident. (See photos on following page.) NORTH AMERICAN UFO FEDERATION By Walt Andrus A major step was taken in Pasadena, California on July 3,1983 for the unification of UFO organizations in the United States and Canada with the formation of the North American UFO Federation. A Steering Committee appointed in Toronto, Ontario on July 4, 1982, culminated their work by establishing corporate bylaws and electing a Board of Directors prior to the meeting in Pasadena. Representing diversified UFO groups, the following people were elected to the Board of Directors: Peter Mazzola (Scientific Bureau of Investigation), Staten Island, New York; Walter H. Andrus, Jr. (Mutual UFO Network), Seguin, Texas; Dr. J. Allen Hynek (Center for UFO Studies), Evanston, Illinois; Rick R. Hilberg (Northern Ohio UFO Group), Berea, Ohio; Charles J. Wilhelm (Ohio UFO Investigators League), Fairfield, Ohio; Mrs. Ann Druffel (SKYNET), Pasadena, California; Henry H. McKay (Canada), Agincourt, Ontario; Dr. Richad F. Haines, Los Altos, California; and Richard H. Hall, (Fund for UFO Research), Brentwood, Maryland. The Steering Committee was chaired by John F. Schuessler of Houston, Texas. Officers elected in Pasadena were Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., Director; Henry H. McKay, Deputy Director; Peter Mazzola, Secretary; and Mrs. Ann Druffel, Treasurer. The purposes of the North American UFO Federation are exemplified in their bylaws: (1) To unite UFO organizations in North America in a format of understanding, cooperation, and harmony of efforts to study and resolve the UFO phenomenon; (2) To share information on UFO sightings and analyses; (3) To develop and use a standard UFO reporting form, which will result in the use of a standard vocabulary of UFOlogy; (4) To produce, distribute, and urge the use of a standard manual for investigating and documenting UFO reports; (5) To develop and maintain a computer file of UFO reports; (6) To establish an effective public relations committee whose chief purpose it is to inform the media/public on new UFO reports, provide educational materials, respond to unfavorable propaganda (continued on page 14)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"J 6     7 Photo Keys: 1.

The North American UFO Federation will work directly with the worldwide International Committee on UFO Research that is meeting in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England on August 26, 1983. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, representing the Center for UFO Studies and Michael Sinclair, representing the Mutual UFO Network will attend this meeting. U.S. NAVY 1942 SIGHTING Paul C. Cerny, Western States Director with Robert Neville, Nevada State Director Two days before the WWII Pacific Guadalcanal invasion by American troops to retake this Japanese occupied island, an unforgetable and astounding event involved the nearby U.S. Navy Fleet. One Navy witness, a Chief at the time aboard the Destroyer U.S.S. Helm #388, had an excellent observation of an incredible encounter with an unknown, unidentified intruder. At 10:00 a.m. the fleet received a radar report from one of the cruisers and a little later a visual sighting of the object was made from their destroyer. The object was approaching the fleet on the wrong radio beam, which changed daily. Since the object was coming in on the wrong beam, it was considered to be enemy or hostile. All ships went to battle stations. When the unknown approached to within 3,000 yards, the crews opened fire on it. The North American UFO Federation Board Members, I. to r., J. Allen Hynek, Walt Andrus, Ann Druffel, Richard Haines, and John Schuessler unknown then made a sharp right turn and headed south from an approach heading of 320°. The UFO increased its speed and then circled the entire fleet once, now at about 3,500 yards away. The object was traveling at such a tremendous speed that the gun crews could not coordinate a lead point fast enough on the target to hit it. All of the gun crews were just firing wildly, trying to get a hit. The target then circled the fleet one more time, then headed south again roughly at the approach point. Afterward, the gun control director estimated the vehicle had reached speeds of up to 10,000 m.p.h. The whole incident lasted only about 5 minutes or less. The witness, who still does not want his name revealed, was on watch duty at the time. He had a pair of 7x50 binoculars and got a pretty good look at it. It appeared to be a fairly flat, silvery disc with a dome right in the middle of the top side. There was no trail or exhaust, and no sound. Its altitude remained relatively between 3,000 to 4,000 feet. Distance remained close to 3,500 yards. After the incident was over, all the crews and personnel were shaken by the incredible experience of encountering something so unbelievable in its speed and maneuvering capabilities. The Captain of the destroyer stated that to at least pacify his crew, he would make a determined effort to find out what it was. Since it was only two days prior to invasion time of Guadalcanal, radio silence between ships was imperative and it was maintained. Any messages were relayed only through flying aircraft (PBY's). Four days after the invasion took place, the Captain called most of the crew together and relayed a message to them from Command Headquarters that the object they had encountered was neither Japanese nor German, noy (continued on next page) 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"RESPONSE TO LAWSON AND McCALL By John DeHcrrera (Note: \"Experimenters' Response: Imaginary Abductions\" by A.H. Lawson and W.C. McCall appeared in No. 181, March 1983.) Ironically, at a time when scandals involving cheating and plagiarism among researchers are rocking the scientific comrminity ; we also are now in such a dispute. I was shocked and hurt by Professor Alvin H. Lawson's remarks and feel obligated to respond. He chose to go public with an issue that should have been settled privately. Papers and articles written by Professor Lawson mention almost nothing about my involvement with the Imaginary Encounter Study. Often he has merely mentioned my name in a footnote. Is this how an equal partner in a study is treated by his colleagues? Books and articles by other writers refer to this as the \"Lawson Study\" or \"Lawson/McCall hypnosis study.\" After the original study was completed, Lawson telephoned me and asked if he could leave my name out of a paper he was writing. \"This is going to be a very controversial issue and you should keep your name out of this,\" he said. \"I am not afraid of controversy and will continue my involvement with hypnosis research,\" I said in similar words. Later, Lawson called again repeating his suggestion that I remain anonymous. Now I was becoming suspicious of his reasons for omitting my name. In response to Lawson's three \"FACTS:\" ' \"FACT #1\": As stated in my article, I asked Dr. McCall . the following: \"What would happen if we hypnotized someone who had never Navy 1942, Continued was neither Japanese nor German, not an enemy, nor was it one of ours. For months afterwards, the witness and other crew members continued to inquire of the Captain for any further information as to what the object was.

SPEEDS UP TO 10,000 MPH. 1 J incident. Fleet ships involved at the time were three cruisers and seven destroyers; all fired at the unknown intruder. The crews were all apprehensive for days that more of the strange visitors might return in force to possibly attack them. The speeds which this \"aircraft\" displayed and somehow eluded the thousands of shells fired at it, gave the crews the uneasy feeling they were no match for it. This was very unnerving. The best estimates on the craft's diameter, as speculated by the various ships' commands, was about 90 feet. The witness still feels the exact details and collected naval information on this particular incident is no doubt still under high security wraps. The date of the experience, he places at either October 9th or 10th, 1942. Due to the length of time involved, he said he has lost track of his other shipmates, but felt the information was definitely on file somewhere in Navy Intelligence files in Washington. The interview with this witness is on a tape cassette in our possession. seen a UFO? Could they be encouraged to describe a UFO abduction also?\" Surprised at this, Dr. McCall stood up from his chair, walked over to where Professor Lawson was standing and repeated my questions — Lawson didn't hear any of my prior conversation with McCall. Soon we all became very excited about this new direction with hypnosis and started planning our study procedure. Lawson originated most of the procedures and solicited opinions from us on these. If we could get Lawson to admit that Dr. McCall approached him with-the idea for this study, we would be closer to resolving the issue of where the original proposal came from! Then ask Dr. McCall where he got the idea? At this time he says he does not remember. \"FACT #2\": I would like to apologize for not helping Professor Lawson with the typing of the study transcripts. Since I was a partner in this study, I should have shared this task. In earlier work, Lawson had mentioned that the typing class at CSULB had been doing his transcribing and I assumed this was still so. Also, I.would like to apologize if I said \"him\" instead of her in reference to the first regression. My copy of the transcripts give only initials and I may be incorrect in this minor point. All transcripts are available, from me, to interested researchers. \"FACT #3\": Where have P'implied that (Lawson) was ill-informed about CE-III and other UFO data\"? He saw things in my article that were simply not therel I mentioned my involvement and opinions only to set the record straight.

Isn't it possible that I know something about hypnosis by now? I pointed out, some common features of REM sleep and hypnosis. My question is, \"could hypnosis be REM sleep?\" This is only an hypothesis requiring further study by someone — not a, definitive pronouncement. \"Mr. DeHerrera's participation in the entire study was marginal, and while he attended most of the sessions, he was not present for all of them. His contributions were interesting, though hot mind-boggling...\" Marginal participation, poor attendance, contributions not mind-boggling; these are merely your value judgments biased to support Lawson's charges. Others may not agree with you on this if they know the facts of this matter: As I have stated, Lawson prepared the outline for the study after we had discussed the objectives and methodology we wanted. He worked very hard at this and we were proud of his outline. Lawson declined my offer to 16 MUFON COOPERATION WITH CUFOS By Walt Andrus When the formation of the Center for UFOs Studies was announced on the Dick Cavett TV Show in 1973 by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Hynek had asked me the previous night if MUFON would support his new organization. He 1 '.received an affirmative reply! When it was established in 1973, the Center for UFO Studies was not intended to be a UFO , membership organization ,to compete, with, existing organizations; however, during the intervening 10 years it has evolveid into such a format help, \"but I did recruit two of the six volunteers for the original experiments and participated in these.

' , ,,.-., . Lawson argues that there is nothing in the tapes to support my claim. What he doesn't say is that all microphones are on the subject and we \"whisper our comments\" away from the subject. There is little chance of discovering these whispers on the tapes. You and Professor Lawson do not hesitate to dismiss all claims of a UFO abduction based on the results of. our imaginary encounter study. Why then, are you perturbed when others question your birth trauma hypothesis? This information is also obtained using hypnosjs. Why stop at \"birth trauma?\" A person under hypnosis will describe things he/she heard during the fetal state. Or ask about past lives or future events. Remember the devastating earthquake that was to destroy California in 1982? How accurate was this information from Brian Scott?D in order to survive. MUFON has not only supported the Center for UFO Studies by • making available our complete list of State and State Section Directors (Provincial Directors in Canada) as an investigative team, but cooperated with CUFOS whenever Dr. Hynek sought help. Unfortunately, some MUFON members have found that the Center for UFO Studies has been unable to reciprocate. With the formation of the North American UFO Federation, (NAUFOF), a giant step in UFOlogical cooperation, I feel that CUFOS as, a participating partner with MUFON, should evaluate their role as an investigative organization. Due to the limited number of field investigators associated with CUFOS, many of whom are MUFON members, we also should reconsider'Our role in assisting CUFOS and UFO sighting investigations so as to be more effective. Whenever CUFOS does not have an investigator in the locale of the sighting report, I recommend that it be submitted directly to MUFON in Seguin, Texas, for assignment, instead of Dr. Hynek calling the appropriate MUFON., State or State Section Director. Robert Gribble, who operates the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington, has found this method the most successful for the reports received on his \"UFO Hotline\" (1-206-722-3000). Actually, Dr. Hynek has rarely utilized the services of the MUFON State Director/State Section Director list. When he did, he also sent one of the Center's investigators, creating embarrassing problems for the ' MUFON people. As a partner in NAUFOF, MUFON will cooperate with CUFOS in the study and resolution of the UFO phenomenon. It has become necessary to define and revise the methods under which MUFON will utilize our Field Investigators, State Section Directors, and State Directors to assist and (continued on page 18)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"LETTERS (Editor's Note: Following are responses to articles published in the Journal, received in recent months. Most have been edited or excerpted due to their length.) Andreasson Case Editor, About Robert Wanderer's wanderings in \"Critic's Corner\" (No., 181, Mar. 1983); why is this man so afraid? I feel at peace with what happened to me. Why can't this man feel peace too? It is so difficult for some people to accept things as they are. My encounters appear to be a threat to him and his well being in some way. What happened to me did in fact happen. In presenting the critical evaluation of my case, Mr. Wanderer as an armchair investigator seems to totally dismiss the evidence presented by all the various professionals involved in the investigation. (Mrs. Luca here disputes several of Mr. Wanderer's statements and allegations—Ed.) Investigators like Mr. Wanderer will probably be studying safe, far away lights in the sky for a long time to come. It appears he cannot or will not accept the possibility that close encounters of the third kind do in fact happen and possess a high strangeness that cannot possibly be fitted into the framework of our limited understand- ing of life. One last word. I do object to the fact that it is at my expense that Mr. Wanderer has attempted to comfort the sense of rationality of those unable to accept the truth. Betty (Andreasson) Luca Cheshire, Conn. Investigator Response Editor, Mr. Wanderer's critique of the Andreasson case should have been researched more thoroughly instead of relying on opinions of so-called UFO experts.'Betty had to be persuaded to undergo hypnosis. She was very reluctant to do so. As investigators, it is our responsibility to protect personal information derived from witnesses, or there won't by any witnesses. Mr. Wanderer devoted two paragraphs to Betty and her daughter Becky, but failed to mention a happily married stable person, Betty's father, also a witness to the incident. Joe Santangelo, MUFON Eastern Regional Director and former Massachusetts State Director, has stated (and I have his permission to quote him): \"He (Mr. Wanderer) was unfair, unkind,. and inaccurate, and should get out of the critique business.\" Jules P. Vaillancourt Ashburnham, Mass. (Ed. Note: Mr. Vaillancourt was one of the primary investigators, with Raymond Fowler, of the Andreasson case.) German Hypothesis Editor, Mr. Morrison (No. 182, Apr. 1983) states that his proffered theory (of Nazi- produced disc craft) is \"one whose likelihood is not negligible by any means.\" The worst kind of ignorance assumes that anything not personally experienced is impossible; the second worst assumes that literally anything is possible. \"One may ask how German physicists could make such a breakthrough without it being duplicated in the past 50 years or so.\" A good point not answered by reference to 13th Century China and/or the working habits of \"creative people.\" \"The new disc technology, however, with its ability to bore wormholes in space and time...\" Be it noted that even the Nazi claimants credited their disc craft with \"only\" a speed of slightly under Mach 2. We all know the cost of the U.S. space program, yet we are to believe that the Nazis were able to fund a secret dimension-spanning machine while fighting World War II, a machine capable of reaching \"...perhaps...some convenient star.\" Saying this is ridiculous is not in contradiction to an \"open, imaginative\" attitude toward saucers. I state boldly that the moon is not made of cheese and I have never bitten a moon rock — does this mean I am being unscientific? Mr. Morrison may be good at math, but his knowledge of geopolitics is abysmal. Hitler did not \"allow the war to start in 1939,\" he started it. (Mr. Banks here goes into other aspects of Nazi Germany and Hitler's ideas and attitudes, and other statements by Mr. Morrison—Ed.) William H. Banks Oakland, Calif. More German Hypothesis Editor, Mr. Morrison's . article was very interesting and intriguing. I found it also to be a nice mental vacation from some of the more terse and dry articles that are brimming with too many IFOs or not-too-unusual nocturnal lights. Is the author aware of Intercept But Don't Shoot by Renato Vesco? This book has some heavyweight documentation and makes this theory more plausible. I don't think this theory accounts for all UFOs, but I do think it is one of many sources. Others, for example, are the psychotronic weapons theory, of course the old standby extraterrestrial theory, and finally the purely psychic theory. As to opening a pandora's box, my ' reply is that scientific breakthroughs don't happen to those who fear that they will open a can of worms. It happens to those of us who are bold enough to look for new • discoveries without prejudice. f Kris Bjork Waco, Tex. Racism in Africa Editor, Cynthia Hind in her article (No. 183, May 1983) says that in my review of her book UFOs: African Encounters (FATE, Dec. 1982) I accused her of racism. I'm terribly sorry that she misread my remarks, which make no such accusation. What I did say was that because of the white-supremacist policies of her country (then known as South Rhodesia) her access to black African nations was limited; therefore, her book dealt almost exclusively with the UFO experiences of white Africans from her own nation and from South Africa. Nowhere did I say or imply that she herself harbors racial prejudicies; all I suggested was that she was a victim of the particular cultural and political circumstances in which she was forced (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Letters, Continued -\\ to operate. My review was critical, but my complaints had to do with her naive treatment of what seemed to be an outlandish hoax, which she treated as a claim meriting serious consideration. Jerome Clark Lake Bluff, 111. Landing Case Editor, William D. Leet reports in his article \"UFO Instrument Landing System\" (No. 180, Feb. 1983) that the engine and headlights of an automobile full of UFO investigators went out as they approached a strip of dry grass over which a UFO had been seen to pass 65 days previously. They pushed the car away from the strip to a point where \"the headlights regained normal brightness,\" and they then were able to restart the engine. Did these experienced NICAP investigators then return with instruments to measure the spooky effect? He doesn't say. Leet also reports that a small gasoline- powered lawn mower mowed across the strip several times. Why was it not affected? Perhaps the claimed effects on the automobile are of less significance than first suggested. What tests they conducted we are not told. Is this a case of poor investigation or poor reportage? Jerold R. Johnson Austin, Texas Reply to Johnson Editor, Brother Johnson's first error is when he calls the newly formed group \"experienced NICAP investigators...\" The very first sentence of my article declares that this was the first case we investigated. We had lots of talent on our team, but we were rookies at investigating UFO confrontations. As for tests of the car and affected area, I expressly stated that the significance of the engine and lights failures escaped us. William D. Leet Texarkana, Ark. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN.TX 78155 Cooperation, Continued cooperate with the Center for UFO Studies. MUFON and CUFOS have agreed on the following procedures: 1. Whenever CUFOS does not have an available investigator in the locale of a UFO sighting report that warrants investigation, the report will be mailed or telephoned to MUFON in Seguin, Texas (512-379-9216) for assignment to a State or State Section Director. 2. all such investigated reports will be mailed to MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155 where they will be duplicated by machine and forwarded to CUFOS. 3. Computer Input (Form 2) must be completed and returned with the other appropriate forms. MUFON.will continue to mail Form 2 upon receipt to CUFOS for entry into their computer. 4. MUFON will immediately stop sending copies of processed membership applications of State (Provincial) and State (Provincial) Section Directors to CUFOS for their utilization as Field Investigators. 5. Appropriate revisions will be made in the third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual to reflect this new procedure as it relates to Section XVIII, Interface with the Center for UFO Studies (Page 143). Director's Message, from p. 20 University of Texas Longhorn Network. During Mr. Norman's visit, he was a guest with Walt Andrus on the popular Allen Dale Program on WOAI in San Antonio on May 20th. The Mutual UFO Network will be one of the co-sponsors with the University of Nebraska in Lincoln for a three-day conference on the subject of \"Exploring Unexplained Phenomena\" in Lincoln, Nebraska on November 11, 12, and 13, 1983. Confirmed speakers are John F. Schuessler, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Budd Hopkins, Larry Fawcett, Linda Moulton Howe, Tom Adams, Dr. Roy Mackal, Loren Coleman, Larry Arnold, and Walt Andrus. Tentative admission price for the three days is $50.00. Ray W. Boeche, MUFON State 18 Director for Nebraska, is the chairperson for the conference. As part of MUFON's public awareness program, Walt Andrus was interviewed on June 24th by Ms. Kristin Gazlay, Bureau Chief for Associated Press (AP) in San Antonio, for a wire service release on the investigative activities of the Mutual UFO Network. Considering the wide distribution and published newspaper articles of the recent interview by Mark Langford, United Press International (UPI) release throughout North America, we are very excited about the potential for favorable publicity that the Associated Press wire service release will create. The MUFON Newsletter to State and Assistant State Directors covering the timely news items from my \"Director's Message\" has been published for April, May, and June 1983 through the courtesy of Mrs. Marge Christensen, State Director for Massachusetts. Considering the logistics and difficulties of providing current material to Journal readers during the past few months, the Newsletter was a welcome publication. It will only be published and distributed in the future when an announcement or an event requires immediate attention, action, or response, such as the NOVA P.B.S. program \"The Case of the UFO,\" details on the 1983 MUFON UFO Symposium, and forthcoming UFO documentaries.

Strange markings on the abductee's body are considered to be a message of some sort. The July 5 ENQUIRER reports that another Brazilian UFO case involved three metal-like objects dropped from a mysterious craft. Analyses of the objects were supposedly conducted by the Criminal Institute of Rio de Janeiro, but no results have been made public. A UFO allegedly stopped the diesel engine of a train in Bolivia on March 10, 1983, according to an article in the July 26 issue. Recent sightings of UFOs in Australia are detailed in the ENQUIRER'S August 9 issue. Jackie Gleason's ex-wife, Beverly, claims that the famous comedian saw the bodies of dead space aliens at Homestead Air Force Base, Florida in 1973. The full story is given in an excerpt from a forthcoming book in the August 16 ENQUIRER. The June 21 issue of THE STAR tells of a British UFO incident in which three women claim to have been taken aboard a UFO and examined by aliens. Hypnotic regressions have provided details of the claimed abduction. Undersea UFO activity is the theme of the \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" column in the July issue of OMNI. The same feature in the August issue discusses the controversial Eduard Meier case in Switzerland. The September issue of FATE contains an article by British researcher Jenny Randies on a so-called \"UFO murder\" case from the small town of Todmorden in Yorkshire, England. Although . there has been much sensational publicity about the case, a core of mystery remains. A new book by Randies, THE PENNINE UFO MYSTERY, will discuss the case in depth. Dr. Berthold E. Schwarz's UFO research efforts will doubtless be familiar to most readers. His articles have appeared in a number of publications, UFOlogical and otherwise. These writings have now been made available in a two-volume set of books, UFO DYNAMICS. Sightings, landings, occupant reports, psychic phenomena, Men in Black and a host of other topics are discussed by Dr. Schwarz. He also reprints articles by such researchers as Brent Raynes, Ted Bloecher, Shirley Fickett, and Brian Cannon. Even if you are familiar with the material, it is handy to have it all in one compilation. Also, some new and very intriguing material on UFO \"crashes\" is found in the concluding chapter of Volume 2.

(See separate story). The Board members were elected by the members of the NAUFOF Steering Committee from the candidates receiving the highest number of votes who agreed in writing to serve in this capacity. This has been a giant step forward in securing cooperation between UFO groups in North America and presenting a united front in UFOlogy to the World. I am predicting that the forthcoming book titled Clear Intent, authored by Larry Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood and scheduled for release by Prentice-Hall during the spring of 1984, will be the vehicle that will force the Pentagon and our government intelligence agencies to reveal why they have conducted a \"Cosmic Watergate\" or coverup with respect to their involvement with UFOs. Fourteen chapters have been devoted to the systematic documentation of the most potent material recovered under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). We hope that Prentice-Hall can pull up their publishing schedule to release this significant book earlier, since the entire manuscript and plates for the photographs were submitted in early June 1983. We are extremely proud of this credible achievement by Larry Fawcett, MUFON Assistant State Director for Connecticut, and Barry J. Greenwood, State Section Director in Massachusetts. Several UFO documentaries are now being produced for television distribution in the near future to either precede or be released as a timely adjunct to the book Clear Intent. One producer has even been \"sworn to secrecy\" by the government in order to have access to UFO material for the film. Reliable sources have informed us that the Pentagon will release a film this Fall to the Public Broadcasting System (P.B.S.), explaining their role and endeavoring to justify the basic reasons for the intelligence agencies cover-up. Please watch your local P.B.S. program schedule starting in August for this anticipated program, since the Journal may not have the showing date in sufficient time to publicize it through this medium. Another good UFO documentary has been contracted for Home Box Office (HBO) TV cable release this year. John Schuessler Displays Lawson Award Check John F.
