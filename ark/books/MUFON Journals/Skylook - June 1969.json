From the Zdit~r', Desk The mystery of midentified flying objects has been solved again.

Such a waste! Anti here is the latest \"last word1'--as reported in \"The Tulsa World, I' May 8, 1969. Read and form your own conclusions. Hignly authoritative military sources are claiming that the mystery of the \"Flying Saucers1'--which has intrigued Americans since 1947-- finally has been solveti. The craft, these sources <say, have been pos- itively identified as spy satellites. The sources cite a smattering of chapter verse, notably details on the crash of a saucer in a barren area of a Western state on the night of Oct. 16, 1967. This craft, it is claimed, was a sztellite launched by -the Soviet Vnion which apparently went out of control while still in the atmosphere. Eere are the details provided by the sources : The satellite was sighted by -two unidentified persons 200 miles from the scene of the crash, about an hour before it went down. They described the craf-ti as apparently l1afire.lt Yresurnably, the craft was also picked up by military radar covering the area, since there are militay installations in t&te general neighborhood. At any rate, the crash luckily was seen by a member of the mili- tary family--an Air Force gunnery sergeant who W~S driving down an otherwise deserted highway. He saw the swce shir, ex~lode and then hurtle to earth about 400 y~rds .Yrm the highlv?y. The 'serge~nt in- spected the wreckdge and concluded, rightly, - tht .the craft had been unmdmed. Then he returned to his base and redorted his find- to his superior officer. Tight security was clamped do5,m. \\The sergeant was moved into a; private room in a special officers' burrzclrs, where he was interro- gated by no less than a brigadier general in an intelligence section. Meanwhile, Air Force Intelligence headquarters in Washington was not- ified. After the sergeantts story had bean transcribed, he signed the original and three carbon copies, and dlso agreed in writing not to divulge to unauthorized persons what he Iz~d seen, Then the Air Force went to work in earnest. Part of a company, armed to the teeth, was dis~tclied to s-Land guard over the wreckage. A special team equipped with a portable laboratory was flown out from \\dashington. iJine days zfter the tean went -50 work, the scientists annomced that the pieces of wreckage indisputably were' the remains .of a Soviet spy ship, Fragments of electronic eavesdropping devices were salvaged.
