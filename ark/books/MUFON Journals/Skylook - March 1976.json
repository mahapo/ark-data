Short Editor-Publisher Emeritus Len Stringfield Commentary Editor's Column Cooperation is on everyone's lips, but not in everyone's ac- tions. In recent weeks we have gotten excellent cooperation from APRO, as well as from Ground Saucer Watch (GSW), Pro- ject Starlight International (PSI), and many MUFON-related groups around the country and world. We have not had any reason to request the coopera- tion of NICAP, so this is an unknown. The organization which should be the most cooperative has been the least cooperative, I refer to the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), headed by Dr. Allen J. Hynek. Despite cooperation from group to group, not including the Center, our present system is inefficient in terms of both research and dissemination. There is a real need for some sort of central clearing house for UFO reports--something con- trolled by and for UFO research groups (such?as APRO, CUFOS, GSW, MUFON, PSI, and NICAP), but immune from control by any one group. Cases could be coordinated through this centralized clear- ing house and assigned to the most appropriate investigators» regardless of group affilia- tion. Perhaps each UFO re- search group could specialize in one or more, areas of re- search, as suggested at the Ft. Smith Conference. Case reports- and photos could be stored -at the clearing house for 'immediate ' dup.litiatS.0ji, and distribution to interested re-« searchers for a small fee tor cover the eo'sts. Expenses . re;quired for the benefit of all- groups could be : . shared by all groups. • - The Center for UFO Studies at one time seemed to hold promise as a central clearing \" house, chiefly because Dr. Hynek's name is well known, but time has eroded Oiar initial '.. hopes. .CUFOS has become a vac- uum- -where reports go in, but do not . come out. It is obvi- ously closely controlled by Dr. HyneR for his own . unknown pur- pose ? . • ,• . A new start in coordination and cooperation is needed--and the Center should be only one ; part in any new concept of a Clearing house—and then only if Dr. Hynek changes his defin- ition of cooperation.

Witnesses: George O'Barski, principal witness; and Bill Pawlowski, possible cor- roborative witness. (Additional witnesses in possible related sightings.) Type of sighting: Occupants, object, electro-magnetic effect, possible ground traces. Investigated by: Ted Bloecher, MUFON state director for New York; Budd Hopkins; and Jerry Stoehrer. George O'Barski, 72, had left his place of employment and was 'driving through North Hudson Park on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River when static began to interfere with his car radio. It was just past 2 a.m. (estimated). The window on the driver's side was partially rolled down, since the tempera- ture was miId.on this January night in 1975. Says O'Barski: \"I begin to notice my radio....Got scratch- ing in it, and it's a tinny sound; it's just like, you know, something is loose, you know? And I thought it was coming from my radio! And I turned up a little more volume and I got more scratching, you know? The radio stops! There ain't nothing, see?\" O'Barski continues: \"Right now, here's this—this droning, like the noise of a refrigera- tor, coming, and I seen this thing coming like that, just like that. It was a floating thing, and here I am here, you. know, and I figured, where in the hell will I go?\" O'Barski said the object seemed to be round, about 30 feet in diameter and six to eight feet tall, with some sort of dome on top. The object was described as being dark, with a series of lighted vertical win- dows around the main body. Each window was .estimated to be a- bout one foot •_ wide and four feet high, spaced about _one Sketch based on description by O'Barski. foot apart. The witness said he saw nothing in the windows ex- cept light, which he described as being about the color of or- dinary household lights. He said there was also a lighted strip around the object at the base of the dome (or upper part of the main body). After moving into the park, parallel with -O'Barski's auto, the object stopped about 100 feet away. At first it was a- boiit ten feet off the ground, then it moved to about four feet above the grassy area. The witness could not tell whether the object was resting on some sort of legs or landing gear or whether it was hovering without mechanical support. Occupants Appear Suddenly a \"square, lighted opening appeared on the craft (it is not clear exactly where on the object the opening ap- peared) and some sort of me- chanical steps extended from the opening.. Quickly, nine to eleven occupants came\" down the steps \"like kids coming down a fire escape.\" The occupants, about \"three to four-feet.tall, were dressed the same--\"like little kids with snowsuits on.\" Each oc- cupant \"had. some kind of thing\" on his head, like some sort of helmet. O'Barski said the hel- met was round and the same, dark color.as the rest of- the uni- form. The occupants also ap- peared to be wearing gloves. As the occupants came down from the object, the witness noted that each was carrying a small dark-colored bag and a small shovel (or spoon). Each bag seemed to have a string or some sort of handle. \"When they came down, they knew what they wanted to do, they done it, and they were gone, just that quick,\" says O'Barski. \"What they wanted to do,\" apparently, was to collect soil samples, since the witness ob- served them digging in various locations near the object and placing soil in the bags,. O'- Barski, following the curving road, was now within 75 feet of the object and occupants. The witness said the occu- pants appeared to move-normal- ly, not like robots. He was most impressed by their appar- ent efficiency. \"They were digging away,\" he explains, \"and as .far as they were con-, cerned .they didn't know I ex- ist. They came down.the steps., as though they had one mission in their entire life—to fill these little bags they had with these little spoons, or shov- els, they .had. The minute they got down, - they, started' work- ing.\" .. --.•'.'.. I Occupants Return to Craft After about one minute, on the ground,- the occupants .re- turned to the object, apparent- ly climbing the same steps back Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"into the object through the same opening they had come out of. (The opening was described as being wide -enough for two occupants to enter the object at the same time, but the wit- ness did not indicate that they had necessarily reentered in •this manner. \"They went up, just like normally.\") O'Barski said that although the occupants had ignored his presence, he was still very frightened and apprehensive. \"Someone is running this thing,\" he explains, \"and I figured maybe they're watching me, and I figured at the' end they're gonna say...they're gonna get that old bird, you know? I'm 72 years old, but I was scared to death. Cause I'm poking around they might have said, 'let's have that old son of a bitch of a guy that's nos- ing around here.' They was sitting over there and I was practically stopped, you know? So I'm thinking maybe they'll press a button that'd blow me up here, or something, you know?\" O'Barski said that after the occupants returned to the ob- ject \"this thing here, it's like the icebox started up a- Poge 4 gain, you know? The motor's started up, out there now that noise was a-humming.\" . ' Sees Bottom of Object : As the object left, O'Barski said he could see the under- side, which was dark and \"it seemed to be as though it was hollowed out underneath, you know? It looked like a depres- sion in there, you know? I said gee, there must be a big fan in there, or something, that runs this thing, you .know? And I'm looking,, but I can't see.noth- ing,\". He said the object grad- ually, but quickly, rose and disappeared from sight. - ; O'Barski said the,object had lifted and disappeared within 20 seconds 'after the occupants had gone back aboard.' \"When they went, it was just like that,\" says the witness. \"Right straight like this, tcheopo! Just that fast..\" As the object left, his radio again started playing—after being off for the approximately 2h minutes the UFO was in the area. ., . . Instead of going to a res- taurant at Fort Lee,, as he had original ly intended, ... 0' Barski went straight-home. ; The owner arid manager ' of a small liquor store in Chelsea (though he does not drink), he explains the extent of his fear by say- ing. \"I've been held up-in the store lots of times in 30 years b.y men' with pistols and knives, and I've been plenty scared, but nothing like this, ever. I was petrified.\" O'Barski said he was sweat- ing when he got : home, pulled the shades, made some' tea, started to listen to the radio, then decided not to stay up (normally- he would .stay up). \"I went to bed. I was that scared.. I pulled the _covers over- my head. I\"figured the whole damn world had come to an end....I didn't know what the he 11 to think I thought either I'm = : going . crazy or there's something awfully wrong down there.\" \" . \" Finds Holes The next'morning, still up- set, he went to the scene of the sighting and found several small holes in the ground, each about, five or six inches ' deep. He relates, \"You know, when I went there and. saw those holes"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I got even more scared. I'll tell you something. I even felt those holes. I didn't be- lieve it looking at them. I put my hand in one.\" During the subsequent inves- tigation of the site, investi- gator Gerald (Jerry) Stoehrer noted that, even after 10 months, eight to ten patches of ground at the site, devoid of grass, seemed to indicate that holes had been dug at that lo- cation. The patches were in an area about six feet by eight feet. While the patches formed no particular pattern, Stoehrer said \"they seemed to appear as definite triangles, with clear- ly defined edges, and of rough- ly the same size.\" He said the length of each triangle ranged from five inches to eight inch- es on each side. One of the investigators, Budd Hopkins, has been casually acquainted with O'Barski since 1958. Says Hopkins of O'Barski, \"He is street-wise, astute, and reflective. He and Bill Burns, his partner, have been my friends, my evening cashing service, and the source of my dinner wine for over 17 years. They are truthful-men.\" O'Barski told no one except his son (O'Barski is a widower) about his experience for many months. His son advised him to keep quiet, since people would think he had become mentally unstable. O'Barski also wonder- ed if the occupants \"would come and get me\" if he told about the experience. Finally, on Nov. 19, 1975, he mentioned the sighting to Hopkins, although he did not know that Hopkins was a UFO investigator (O'Bar- ski had never shown any prior interest in UFO's). O'Barski had delayed reporting the ex- perience so long that he is now unsure of the exact date. Other Witnesses? In an effort to locate other witnesses to the O'Barski sighting, personnel at the fashionable Stonehenge, a tall apartment complex located at 8200 Kennedy Blvd. East, about 300 yards east of the location of the alleged sighting, were questioned. The west side of Stonehenge has an excellent view of the alleged sighting area, and the main entrance to the apartment building, manned 24 hours a day by a doorman, is on that side. Eventually a man by the name of William Pawlowski, a former doorman at Stonehenge, was un- covered as a possible corrobor- ating witness. Without knowl- edge of the O'Barski report, and without coaching, Pawlowski recounted an episode that he termed \"frightening.\" The Pawloski Sighting While on duty at Stonehenge— he thinks it was about 2:30 or 3 a.m. on Jan. 12, 1975--he was attracted by very bright lights in the vicinity of North Hudson Park. \"When you look out,\" ex- plains Pawlowski, \"you see a view of the park, and all of a sudden I see something out there—lights, you know? And it looked like they were spaced about two feet\" or maybe three feet apart, in a round circle.\" He ignored the lights at first, thinking perhaps there was a string of cars in the park facing toward him. He estimated there were eight or nine lights in a horizontal row, but he was not sure of the number. As he made a phone call to one of the residents of Stone- henge (the call was not related to the sighting) he began to think that the lights could not be cars because they appeared to be above the ground. At this point he wondered if he•was observing a UFO (he says that he and his wife had seen one in the summer of 1970 or 1971 over a meadow). Explains Pawlowski, \"I'm looking at it and I'm talking to the party (on the phone), and I'm think- ing to myself, what the devil is that?\" Suddenly, while he was still on the phone, he heard a loud report and the large plate glass window he was looking through cracked at one corner near the floor. He quickly hung up the phone and investi- gated the crack, which he thought might have been caused by a rifle shot--perhaps from the area where he could see the strange lights. After investigating the glass and finding only a small chipped area along the 12-18- inch crack on the outside, he looked back toward the park and the lights were gone. He called\" the police, who investigated the crack and said it had not been caused by a bullet. Paw- lowski told the police he had seen lights in the park area, but did not tell the investi- gating officers of the suspic- ious nature of the lights. He did, however, tell Lt. Al Del Gauidio of the North Bergen Police Department of his sus- picions, since this officer lived at Stonehenge. Officer Del Gauidio, contacted later by Hopkins, verified Pawlowski's description of the events, but added that he did not believe any of them \"because you can't believe things like that.\" Del Gauidio said he had re- turned to Stonehenge from his night shift about 6:30 a.m. and noticed the broken window. He said Pawlowski had mentioned a \"flying saucer\" or \"UFO,\" but since \"such things are impossi- ble,\" Del Gauidio thought the doorman had somehow broken the glass and had made up the story to cover an accident. He said he had no evidence of this, but that he believed Pawlowski was a heavy drinker—though he did not think Pawlowski had been drunk when he saw him at 6:30 a.m. Tree Split? In addition to the window, Pawlowski reported that a tree between Stonehenge and the lo- cation of the lights (on the hill opposite Stonehenge) had split or been split that same night. This was one of a clump of three trees which had grown from a common stump. The tree has since been sawed. Pawlowski has expressed some Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"confusion as to the exact loca- tion of the lights. While he indicated while revisiting the area that they were in the same location as O'Barski's sight- ing, he also felt they were be- hind a flagpole (which has since been removed). In a drawing from memory, he had located the flagpole be- tween Stonehenge and O'Barski's observation area, but a check at the scene indicated that the flagpole had actually been lo- cated some distance to the south. Investigators surmised that Pawlowski had confused a street light or other object with the flagpole on the night of the sighting, but the wit- ness still felt he had seen the object behind the. flagpole. Pawlowski's description of the light from the object does not exactly match that of O'- Barski, since O'Barski indicat- ed the light was more like that produced by incandescent bulbs, while Pawlowski seemed to. feel it was more like light produced by flourescent .bulbs. Still another difference in the two reports is the state- ment by O'Barski that the weather was mild (he had the car window partially down), while Pawlowski thought the weather had been cold. (He had had a run-in with the manage- ment of Stonehenge because they would not allow doormen to wear coats in the winter--he had quit after losing the argument —so this may have had some bearing on his general feeling that the January sighting date had been cold.) Weather records indicate that the temperature at 2 a.m. on Jan. 12, 1975, was 56 degrees—rather mild. Overall, however, the two independent reports are remark- ably alike in terms of the des- cription of the object,.the lo- cation of the sighting, and the duration of the sighting. It is, of course, only con- jecture that O'Barski and Paw- lowski saw the same object at the same time, since O'Barski was not certain at all of the exact date of his sighting. Pawlowski's date is more exact, Page 6 Sketch by Pawloski of what he saw from Stonehenge Apartments. Sketch by Gonzales of what he saw from Stonehenge Apartments. but not completely confirmed. Gonzales Sighting While the Pawlowski sighting was being checked, the current superintendent of Stonehenge, Amaury Perez, said that another former employee and personal friend, Frank Gonzales, had told him of a sighting in Jan- uary of 1975. Ted Bloecher talked by phone with Gonzales, who said that he had seen \"something round, very bright\" like, an aluminum plane with windows, in the park in front of Stonehenge at 2 or 3 a.m. on a Monday in early Janu- ary, 1975. Gonzales said that after seeing the light he went to the door, opened it, , and went into the. driveway. Then he heard a noise \"NOT like a helicopter, something DIFFER- ENT. Something like a buzzing, like when a jet takes off. Whooooh. Whoooooh. Then I was afraid.\" He says he went back inside and closed the door, then saw the light go straight up. Gonzales could not estimate the distance to the object he had seen, but said it was di- rectly in front of Stonehenge in the direction of the park. He thought the object was round, with windows around the bottom. The light from the windows was bright, \"like a cool white tube.\" Gonzales said his sighting took place, he thought, before the plate glass window had been cracked. This would probably put his sighting on Jan. 6, a- bout six days before the Paw- lowski (and O'Barski?) sight- ing, although none of the dates is known for certain. Gonzales said it was a cold and clear night. Daliz Sighting While video taping the Paw- lowski and O'Barski statements on Jan. 17, 1976, the investi- gators were told by the current doorman at Stonehenge, William Daliz, that he had sighted a strange light in the vicinity of the park just two days ear- lier—on Thursday, Jan. 15, at about 2:30 a.m. In a subsequent interview, Daliz said he was attracted by a strange light in front of Stonehenge, even though he was watching TV with his back to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the front door. He said the light was \"big,\" and that the left side^ was orange and the right side was red. He said he rang for the se- curity officer downstairs, but the officer at first did not want to look. \"Well, by the time Roberto went to look out, I seen this light just go right up,\" Says Daliz. \"I even opened the door and walked out. I seen it just go straight up. Oh, it was really fast.\" Daliz said the color of the .illumination became lighter as the object was near the ground, but got darker as.it lifted in- to the sky. . . Security Officer Roberto Perez was contacted later, and he verified the fact that Daliz had ..called . him . about the strange .light, 'but he looked- too -late to- see the object him- self. A Strange Mist? Another doorman at Stone- henge, Edward Oberterbessing, told investigators that in the period beginning in late Janu- ary and continuing into May (1975) he had often seen a fog or mist that would gather at the spot where he had seen the investigators standing (the 0'- Barski landing site). He said the fog was extremely localized and would be dissi- pated after being \"swirled a- round by the wind.\" He said it would appear both in the day and night. Investigator Stoehr- e'r says he feels this witness did observe what he claims, and is not just \"jumping onto the bandwagon.\" Oberterbessing re- portedly had a 1961 observation of several anthropod figures at Ridgefield, NJ. Investigation Continuing The total investigation is continuing, since, there have been additional indications that other residents of Stone- henge may have seen something. Stonehenge Superintendent Ama- ury Perez, . who has been very cooperative, has given the names of the investigators to several residents, but says he cannot give investigators the names of the residents unless they ask to be contacted. Summary The sighting by the principal witness, O'Barski, seems to have been at least partially or tentatively collaborated by at least one other sighting, pos- sibly more. The scene des- cribed by O'Barski is, of course, common to many other occupant sightings. It is, however, unusual for a sighting of this type to take place in such a heavily populated area as metropolitan New York. • Correction Miss Margo Metegrano, office manager of the Center for UFO Studies, has informed SKYLOOK that a statement in the Febru- ary issue of SKYLOOK regarding the amount of her salary as CUFOS secretary which was paid by NATIONAL ENQUIRER is incor- rect. The incorrect account in the February issue stated, \"Half of Miss Metegrano's salary was re- portedly being paid by the NA- TIONAL ENQUIRER.\" The correct information, as supplied by Miss Metegrano, is as follows: \"In the very early days of the Center, for several months, the Enquirer did make a donation to the Center from which a small part of my salary was paid.\" Las Vegas occupant report requires study An alleged occupant case near Las Vegas, NV, on Jan. 30 in- volving a country and western singer is being withheld by Skylook, pending additional in- vestigation. . . : MUFON investigator Mike Schutz told Skylook he is high- ly skeptical of the case, re- ported in the Las Vegas SUN, for various reasons. If addi- tional significant information does become available it will be printed in a future issue. MUFON Symposium speakers announced Henry H. McKay, MUFON pro- vencial director for Ontario and regional director for Can- ada, has been added to the list of featured speakers for .the 1976 MUFON Symposium at Ann Ar-. bor, MI, June 12 and 13,. McKay, a veteran researcher, will speak on \"Canadian Landing Trace Cases.\" Other featured speakers at the symposium will be Dr. J. Allen Hynek, director of the Center for UFO Studies; William Spaulding, western director of Ground Saucer Watch, who will speak on analysis of UFO pho- tos; Ray Stanford, director of Project Starlight Internation- al, who will speak on the PSI instrumented research project; Jacques Vallee; and Dave Webb, co-chairman of the Humanoid Study Group, who will speak on humanoid cases. The 1976 Symposium will be hosted by Bob Stinson and the Michigan Section. Illinois woman reports strange encounter The Associated Press reports that an investigator from the Center for UFO Studies is checking into a case involving a woman who encountered uniden- tified \"beings\" in Southern Illinois. Authorities said the middle- aged woman was driving on a country road northwest of Nash- ville, IL, on the night of Feb. 25 when she encountered two \"humanoids\" who flashed a blue light at her before she sped away. The woman described two very tall humanoids \"with large feet and no necks.\" The woman's identity was being withheld. NEW CUFOS ADDRESS The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) 'has moved into a three- .room suite outside the .business area of Evanston, IL. .The new address is 924 Chicago Ave., Evanston, IL 60202. Page 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Denmark photos appear to be clever hoax Additional analysis and in- formation is now available re- garding the two Odense, Den- mark, photos which have created considerable interest over a period of several months. (See December, 1974, and January, 1975, SKYLOOK; note also that one of the two photos appeared in the January section of the 1976 SKYLOOK calendar, Novem- ber, 1975, issue.) This latest information sug- gests that the photos are prob- ably clever fakes. This conclusion, which is contrary to the earlier evalua- tion of the photos by former MUFON consultant Adrian Vance, is based on the following evi- dence, none of which was avail- able to Vance when he conducted his analysis. GSW Photo Analysis The most objective evidence now available is in the form of a comprehensive evaluation just completed by Ground Saucer Watch of Phoenix, AZ, of two color slides (the original pho- tos were color negative prints). The GSW analysis for MUFON included three computer techniques: edge enhancement, color contouring and profiling, and digitizing (computer en- hancement) . Following is a portion of the report by William H. Spaul- ding, director of the Western Division of GSW: \"A majority of the technical camera data, once again, had to be gained by studying the film from its apparent densities, etc. because this important in- formation was never included with the pictures. GSW's photo consultant, Fred Adrain, aided this preliminary analysis. \"However, some items neces- sary for his evaluation (f- stop, lens manufacture, etc.) were based on mathematical Page 8 Copy of the first of two Odense, Denmark, photos allegedly taken June 22, 1974. ^--Jl'j^J s'r ~^ tip \"'• ?.-<=. - .-, ^^^ . — • . . .. - -^L - MET^ — - -_-= ^Ifc^V.;,^^?-' f^^ ^^•^T; J:;'i --^ i^i i '•r^ 3F-.--i-r.~^ The reproductions above and below are from a computer analysis of the Denmark photos.

It would be easier, or shall I say^, a prerequisite, if all photographs submitted for evaluation had the technical film/camera data. \"STEP ONE--Edge Enhancement— Both pictures were edge en- hanced to gain the detail of the 'object 1 and the surround- ing sky area, for the physical data on comparative densities ' (Z) recorded-on the film base. These negative densities can be j related to relative illuminan- ces on the film plane and therefore to relative bright- nesses of the; object that was photographed. \"The relative shapes and the placements of the images also contain data on the relative sizes and directions, to the object photographed. In photo I (GSW) the details of the edges (boundaries) are well de- fined, including the cumulus clouds in the background. The object has a relatively low grey value (density) except the area where the sun is striking the UFO. \"The densities profile into a non-metallic surfaced object, possibly a skin texture of plastic or painted wood. \"STEP TWO--Color Contouring/ Profiling—this was utilized to i determine exact shape and sub- l stance. Note Photo II (GSW) which reveals a common (bland) ^ color, indicative of a 'low 1 reflecting object. The aspect ratio (height to width) is 2 to 4 and disc-shaped; however the object is small in relative size because it is closer to the camera/witness. \"STEP THREE--Digitizing—This revealed a sharper output (clearer picture), although the same negativeness is projected with regard to size and dis- tance . \"CONCLUSIONS AND ANALYTICAL RESULTANTS--The following data points are concluded with the interpretation of the computer results: \"1) The color film is of a medium speed, probably an ASA of 160. This data was derived from a micro-examination of the transparencies (grain size re- lation) \"2) The shutter speed is be- tween jjjQ^- and j~ nn of a second (to capture the data on the film, with relation to move- ment) \"3) The witness most likely used a 101 to 135 mm (short) telephoto lens. \"4) The UFO is within 50 to 100 feet of the camera. \"5) The extreme density (Z) variance in background (sky), comparing slide #3 and #11, is interpreted as exposures taken at different times (not within two seconds as the witness re- lates) . Even with a 50-70% overexposure factor, occurring when the slides were duplicat- ed, the densities do not equate. Neither does the sky (cloud) information. It is postulated -that over an hour difference is. the time span be- tween the exposures. (The angle of refracted lumines (i.e., light from the sun) has an ap- preciable difference in its total grey value). The comput- erized pixel (picture cell scan) reveals an obvious major density change. \"6) The object measures less than 12 inches in diameter. The depth of field data formula and the measurement of the lumines supplied this information. \"7) The grain structure on the two films is completely different. Even allowing for duplication errors of exposure and other anamalous inconsis- tencies in color film manufac- turing, the data represents two separate rolls of film. This could be verified with the or- iginals and an electron micro- scrope scan. (GSW can perform this test with the originals) \"The pictures, although clear and detailed, unfortunately offer very little solid data to the continuing effort of scien- tific Ufology. At best, it only sharpens the senses of the pho- tographic interpreter and of- fers another bit of data for computer imaging methodology.\" The Witnesses The photographer, Mr. Jorma Viita, claimed that when he took the two photos on June 22, 1974, three other witnesses al- so saw the object. He provided the names and . addresses of these three witnesses, a German couple living in Paris and a Japanese youth. Douglas Bonner Jr., a lawyer living in Paris, attempted to check on the two Germans for MUFON, but reported that the address provided by Viita turned out to be a general ad- dress, rather than a specific one. A check of directories also failed to turn up the al- leged witnesses. The address for the Japanese youth was even more general. . Hoax Suspected The photographer, Mr. Viita, has claimed to have taken a number of other UFO photos over a period of time, and has re- ported making contact with oc- cupants. Sources in Denmark now discount these photos and Vii- ta 's claims, and suspect that the objects photographed were models. The independent report from Denmark that the \"UFOs\" may be models matches very well with the GSW evaluation that \"the densities profile into a non- metallic surfaced object, pos- sibly a skin texture of plastic or painted wood.\" (EDITOR'S NOTE—GSW has in- formed SKYLOOK that it is cost- ing GSW $20-25 for each compu- terized enhancement output, and that \"in the future we must re- ceive a minimum of $15 per en- hancement made, which is a bar- gain considering the time en- volved.\" We agree.)

The witness has reportedly viewed this teh, which was distributed by United Press International, and indicated that it is generally accurate. Fargo, ND Woman reports abduction, examination Date: Aug. 26,1975. Location: near Fargo, N.D. Type of case: abduction, physiological effects. Witnesses: Mrs. S. L.; possibly two other main witnesses; possibly two additional corroborating witnesses. EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is a preliminary report, compiled from var- ious sources. It should be emphasized that this case has not yet been thoroughly analyzed by trained investigators. Hope- fully, additional information will be avail- able for the next issue of Skylook. The name of the principal witness is not being used because of the nature of the case, even though her name has been used in the media. Information on this case has been compiled by Joe Brill and assimi- lated by Dwight Connelly. Mrs. S.L. of Fargo, N.D., has related, under hypnosis, that on Aug. 26, 1975, she and two other persons were abduc- ted by UFO occupants, that she was given a strange and thor- Page 10 ough examination, and that she has experienced certain physi- cal effects as a result. The experience began, says Mrs. S.L., about 3:30 a.m. as she, her daughter Jackie, and her daughter's boyfriend Terry left Fargo, N.D., heading west on Interstate 94 toward Bis- mark. As they reached a point 39 miles west of Fargo, they heard \"a big noise,.\" described by Mrs. S.L. as \"louder than any thunder imaginable,\" but \"like thunder.\" Says Mrs. S.L., \"Then the sky lit up and eight or ten glowing objects came down out of the sky. They were round, orange, glowing balls.\" Mrs. S.L. continues: \"Then we realized that there, were tail lights in front of us. So we pulled up alongside of them and I rolled the window down. I said, 'Did you see that? 1 And the guy said, 'Yeah.' And Terry said, 'Well, pull over, we want to talk to you.' The passenger in the camper said, \"We're get- ting the hell out of here.' They never did stop.\" Time Lapse Mrs. S.L. said that it was 5 a.m. when they reached Tower City, about 40 miles from Far- go. \"When we got there I did- n't realize where we were, and I didn't know what time it was. It was later that we realized that there must have been some kind of time lapse.\" When the trio reached Bis- mark at 8 a.m., Mrs. S.L. no- ticed that she was having an unusually heavy menstrural flow, though it was not at a time when menstruration would normally occur. (Editor's note: this has been reported in at"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"least one other case currently under investigation.) Eventually, Mrs. S.L. was placed under hypnosis by Dr. Leo Sprinkle of the University of Wyoming. Under hypnosis, she said that she had been taken aboard a UFO, stripped naked, and given \"a complete medical exam\" by a creature \"with elastic bandages for a head, or elastic bandages around its head.\" According to United Press International, the creature's body looked like \"brown vinyl.\" Mrs. S.L. des- cribed the occupants as \"mummy like.\" Mrs. S.L. is quoted by UPI as aying, \"Even our heads were opened and all parts of our brains looked at...we were dis- sected like frogs.\" However, Dr. Sprinkle phrases it somewhat differently: \"She said it were as if she were a frog being dissected. Now this is the kind of statement we have gotten from other people who claim to have been abduc- ted. It's a sort of feeling of indifference. Perhaps, benevo- lent indifference. They don't seem to mean any harm. They're like scientists coldly doing their work.\" Sinus Cure? Mrs. S.L. stated under hyp- nosis that some sort of knife- like or needle-like instrument was pushed up her nose during the examination. She says that several times during the exam- ination her nose was swabbed with something. She claims that prior to this she had a chronic sinus condition which has since completely disappeared. There was apparently also an examination of Mrs. S.L.\"s sex- ual organs. She also said, un- der hypnosis, that a bright light was placed on her face and about her head. She said that during the examination the examiner frequently pushed some buttons on a panelboard. Mrs. S. L.'s 15-year-old daughter Jackie was also hypno- tized, but apparently had not been taken aboard the UFO. She Says, according to UPI, that she felt as though she had been \"left stranded in a field.\" She seemingly lost track of the others during the experience. The daughter's boyfriend has, as of this writing, refused to participate in the investiga- tion, although Mrs. S.L. has said that he, too, had been taken aboard. There were reportedly two additional independent witness- es to the sighting of the glow- ing objects on Aug. 26 who ap- parently called the Air Force base at Grand Forks to report their sightings. At this time their identity is not known by SKYLOOK. .A report of the ac- tual sighting was made to the North Dakota State Police. Jerry Clark, one of the in- vestigators, working on the case, evaluates the witnesses as follows: \"The one thing that I'm per- sonally convinced of, having been involved with the people concerned for some time, is their sincerity. I think they really believe what they're saying. I believe they saw something they couldn't ex- plain. Beyond that, I would hesitate to speculate. But I will say this: it is a very strange story—as strange as any I've encountered in my in- vestigations.\" Dr. J. Allen Hynek of the Center for UFO Studies also participated in the investiga- tion. A Chicago TV station (WLS-TV) paid Dr. Hynek's ex- penses to Fargo as part of a program the station was doing on the conduct of UFO investi- gations. Dr. Hynek's reaction to the case, according to UPI: \"She (Mrs. S. L.) seemed to live through a frightening exper- ience (i.e. through hypnosis). I believe she thinks she was taken aboard a UFO. I don't think she is lying, in other words.\" Concludes the main witness, Mrs. S.L., \"I didn't make this . thing happen. If I wanted to be'a star or something, I think I'd go about it another way.\" N 1CAP report erred in Walton case EDITOR'S NOTE: Additional informa- tion continues to become available con- cerning the Travis Walton abduction case reported in the December and February issues of SKYLOOK. Last month we quoted from reports on the case published in the APRO BULLETIN and the NICAP INVESTI- GATOR, noting that APRO and NICAP had come up with opposite conclusions concerning the case. In the meantime, Ray Fowler has checked into NICAP's published report and clarified the situa- tion. Fowler sent the following report to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, with copies to J. Acuff, W. Andrus, and W. Webb: The NICAP position outlined in the UFO INVESTIGATOR and its negative outlook appears to have been influenced by the as- sertions that (1) Travis Walton contacted a radio talkshow about the prospects of his appearing as a \"contactee\" prior to the al- leged abduction incident. (2) Travis Walton is an avid UFO buff, and (3) The section of the poly- graph test dealing with the UFO might have been negative, but the non-related sections might have been positve, thus giving the impression that the poly- graph test as a whole was posi- tive. Since the NICAP article was supposed to have been based up- on a \"thorough job\" and \"fac- tual information,\" I queried NICAP by phone on 9,and 11 Feb- ruary, 1976, to obtain the doc- umentation for these asser- tions . To make a long story short, NICAP based its article upon two letters from NICAP Investi- gator Dr. William Bickel, Phy- sics Department, University of Arizona (Office: 602/884-2524 and Home: 602/792-9304). NICAP could not identify the radio station mentioned, nor. did NICAP have the polygraph rec- ords . I talked to Dr. Bickel by phone 9 February, 1976. He told me that he was surprised by the NICAP article ..as he had not performed a formal investiga- Poge 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"tion. He merely had written two letters to NICAP recounting what he was reading in the newspapers and what he had thought he had heard Sheriff Coplin tell Mm. However, he told me that Sheriff Coplin denied ever telling him about the \"radio show\" story and that Travis Walton apparently was not a UFO buff. Dr. Bickel did not in- vestigate the Walton report be- cause he assumed another NICAP investigator named Jordan was doing a good job. Unfortunately for NICAP, Jordon never submit- ted his report, and Dr. Bickel said that Jordan turned over the material to APRO. I explained to John Acuff (NICAP director) that the NICAP article took undue literary license and that it might pos- sibly hamper present and future enquiries into the incident, as the data contained therein was not necessarily factual and not based upon a \"thorough job\" as stated. John explained that the article was published in the manner of a \"news item\" rather than a thoroughly re- searched report in order to keep NICAP members abreast of the -situation. He assured me that future positive and/or negative data would be published in follow-on articles. Apparently NICAP has knowledge that Travis Walton's mother is an avid UFO buff who has, in the past, expressed a desire for personal UFO abduc- tion. Perhaps if the whole family had been taken, we would not be mixed up in this confus- ing case intermixed with con- flicting organizations, person- alities, undocumented state- ments, etc. In all fairness to NICAP, Dr. Bickel's letters were rather dogmatic and negative and prob- ably convincing. It is regret- able that Dr. Bickel did not follow up these letters with the information he gave me over the telephone. Some kind of lesson should be learned from all this. Women chased The following account by Jerry Harris appeared in the Feb. 20, 1976, edition of the Talladega-Sylacauga, Alabama, DAILY HOME. . The case has not been checked by UFO investi- gators. (Submitted by Robert E. Conner) TALLADEGA--TWO frightened women say they were chased more than 18 miles Wednesday night by a fleet of unidentified fly- ing objects. The women—Miss Charlotte Staples and Mrs. Geneva Carruth —said five \"reddish-orange ob- jects\" hovered over and near their car as they traveled at high speeds trying to get help: Both women are employed at Special Technical Facility in Talladega and have been des- cribed by their superiors as \"sober, respectable individuals who don't tell tales like this unless there's something to it.\" Miss Staples said their plight began at 8:30 p.m. Wed- nesday on Highway 77 at Easta- boga. \"We were on our way home from Gadsden, and were riding along talking when I saw this Waltons pass polygraph exam The Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) has re- leased the results of polygraph tests on both Travis and Duane Walton. Both \"passed\" the test. The tests were administered by George J. Pfeiffer of the Ezell Polygraph Institute, which is certified and licensed in Arizona. Pfeiffer, an ex- police officer, is a licensed and experienced polygraph oper- ator, according to APRO. Ezell Institute was selected by Dr. Harold Cahn, APRO's con- sultant in parapsychology and physiology, to give the tests. Following are the \"pertinent\" questions asked of Travis, a- long with his answers, as re- ported by APRO: 1. Before November 5, 1975, were you a UFO buff? Answer: No. 2. Since November 1, 1975, have you . used any illegal drugs? Answer: No. 3. Have you been truthful with Mr. Lorenzen in the ac- count of your UFO experience? Answer: Yes. 4. Were you struck by a blue-green ray on the evening of November 5, 1975? Answer: Yes. 5. Are there approximately only 2 hours you recall during your UFO experience? Answer: Yes. 6. Did you find yourself on a table in a strange room? An- swer : Yes. 7. Did you see three strange creatures in the room? Answer: Yes. 8. Did you conspire with another to perpetrate a hoax in this matter? Answer: No. 9. Have you been reasonably accurate in describing your ex- perience? Answer: Yes. In regard to charges that Navajo County Sheriff Marlin Gillespie or Undersheriff Ken Coplan had said that Travis had attempted to get on a radio talk show to discuss UFO's be- fore the alleged incident, APRO comments that the sheriff's of- fice denies that such a state- ment was made. Says APRO, \"Gillespie, while maintaining a neutral posture to the press, has privately told friends and associates that he believes Walton.\" APRO also says that Travis was not a UFO buff prior to the sighting. Comments APRO, \"Our findings are that he has a healthy curiosity about many things, including UFOs, but had never bought a book on the sub- ject or joined a UFO organiza- tion—in fact, he did not know that such organizations exist- ed.\" Page 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"by UFOs light over\" to my left, in the woods kinda, real close to the road,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have thought any- thing about it except for its color. I've never seen anything like it before in my life. It was about the size of a number three washtub, oval-shaped, and was an orange color that-didn't scatter—like regular light does. , Mrs. Carruth, a teacher at . the Facility, said she observed '_ the light and \"told Charlotte it must have been a plant (in- dustry) of some type that was all lit up.\" Miss Staples said she had slowed the car to about \"five or ten miles an hour\" when she looked in her rear view mirror and saw a glow in the sky, \"like a woods fire or some- thing.\" When they looked, however, they saw another object, \"about six or eight feet above the other one. \"Then while we were looking two more appeared. \"They didn't come from the sky or from the ground, they just popped up in front of us, like a light switch • was turned on. \"We weren't scared then, but they glided out to the highway and started coming towards us. \"They got within two to three hundred feet from us and were coming straight towards the car. By this time there were five of them in all. We got scared and took off real fast.\" According to Mrs. Carruth, who was a passenger, the ob- jects hovered over, alongside, and eventually in front of the car, even though Miss Staples was driving, about 80 miles an hour. \"I kept trying to laugh it off, to rationalize and console Charlotte until those things - started hovering around the car like that. There wasn't another . car on the road, either.

I've never seen any- thing like it in my life. \"Whatever they were, I honestly feel like they were trying to catch us, and I'm telling you the honest truth. When we couldn.'t see ;hem we could still tell where they were because the sky and area around the car stayed lit up the whole time,\" she said. Miss Staples said she had a CB radio unit in the car and could not get in touch with anyone. \"It 'was weird; there was nothing on the radio at all. I mean, those things have static and noise going on all the time,'and you can monitor other people talking constantly, but we couldn't pick up anybody.\" According to Mrs. Carruth, the objects \"were flying too low and too close to be. regular aircraft.\"' She said no sound was obvious at any time. The objects were observed \"at least 30 minutes.\" \"I was trying my best to find another car or house or some- body on the road, I was even trying to get a ticket just so somebody else could see those things,\" said Miss Staples. \"They were never higher than the tree tops, and they fol- lowed the car so close .that when we made a turn at a curve or something, they turned right along with us.\" The objects \"just disap- peared\" as the two women left Lincoln City limits. After reaching Talladega, the two women tried to convince police they had an honest.and terrifying experience, but to no avai1. \"They asked us if we were drinking or taking drugs or something,\" Miss Staples said. \"But everybody who knows us knows we do not drink, that we do not tell wild stories like this.\" Dempsey Byrd, .public rela- tions executive at the Facil- ity, vouched for their charac- ter. \"Miss Staples- is an interpre- ter in our deaf and blind Sun- day school class at the Facili- ty,, and I have known her for 13 years or more. I believe what she has described is just exac- tly what she saw. I've never heard her tell anything but the truth,\" he said. Today the two women are calmer, but no less convinced what they saw was real. \"I finally got my wish, and then some. I'd always wanted to see one of- them things until Wednesday night,\" Miss Staples said. Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Stringfield Report By Len Stringfield It has been 20 years since this trenchant pen has cut its way into print to report and comment on ufological affairs. When I stopped publishing the monthly CRIFO/ORBIT newsletter, in March, 1957, followed by my privately published book, \"Saucer Post 3-0 Blue,\" Septem-. ber, 1957, I thought that I had bowed out of the editorial phase of the UFO controversy. During those early days, the task of publishing was not only fraught with problems of costs and unbelievable time consump- tion, but the aggravations of dealing with a growing new breed infiltrating UFO research --the coteries of buffoons with extra far-out philosophies, the machinations of money-minded opportunists, the parasitical pests who leeched valuable time, and the pixie personali- ties who liked to snip or slan- der, rather than sleuth down a good report. This breed, feeding on the weaknesses of ufology as a re- sult of official cover-up, double-talk and ridiculing sighters of the UFO, too often parroted by the press, were not content to clutter my mail with their drivel, but veritably put my home under seige with sudden visits from everywhere USA. Needless to say, it made the job of trying to edit an objec- tive paper a questionable en- terprise. Bock Again But, here I am again, willing Page 14 to do a column in one\" of the major research UFOzines. While my tenure in this endeavor may be tenuous for other reasons in today's more sophisticated, scientific-oriented, but still disunified research, I will try to keep readers posted on UFO news from the many sound re- searchers in the field with whom 1 have established cordial relationships. •\" While this column will;have little appeal in' filling,, the need of scientific disciplines, it hopefully will serve to keep UFO news aflow, news that is normally exchanged between a handful of researchers, or news that normally gets buried in the filing cabinets\" of'the ma- jor research groups. Most researchers know that I believe in open-end communica- tions. Information, unless it is stricly confidential, or proprietary, is useful only when communicated. Without its dialogue there will never be unity between the major re- search groups, and without it, not even unity WITHIN groups. While efforts have been made toward some workable detente, unity remains as elusive as the UFO itself! UFO research belongs to everybody willing to put forth effort: the scientists, the professional writer or lectur- er, the \"old hands,\" the \"hooked\" newcomer, the teenager perhaps untrained but willing, and the . countless citizens everywhere who have hidden within themselves a strange or frightening experience with a UFO, but will not surface for fear of ridicule. Of the latter group more and more persons—responsible per- sons—with stories to tell of abduction, of close encounters with humanoids or revealing unusual physiological effects, etc., are beginning to lift their heads from the sands. More will surface once serious UFO research gets just as ser- ious in working together in some degree of unity, or at least detente. Strength in Unity In unity there is strength, and to be strong, there must follow support—at least moral support from the media; and financial• from sources confi- dent to provide needed funding. Summarily, if we fail in com- munication, which can only fes- ter the rancor among some ele- ments of research, causing their best data to be sup- pressed, then we are the unwit- ting tools of the official si- lencers who prefer secrecy by design. Ideally, I wish I could offer a regular technical column for a .scientific-oriented SKYLOOK, using the best of the UFO cases hidden in research or secreted in military files. Surely, these cases, postulating the strongest evidence, would open the eyes.and win the respect of the media and the hard-nosed scientific and business commun- ity. Alas, realistically, this journalistic plumb is beyond our reach for obvious reasons-- the dearth of scientifically endorsed UFO cases submitted for publication, underscored by the prohibitive cost of pub- lishing a slick professional journal. Instead of pipe dream- ing, here's a beginning at keeping the news channels open. The Military and UFOs From a reliable source in Southwestern U.S., I have learned that our military is concerned sufficiently about the UFO incursion to establish a newly designed, sophisticated radar system in strategic areas for the sole detection of UFOs. Coupled with this ground-to-sky system it was further revealed to me that the Navy's atomic submarines have also been equipped with new instrumenta- tion- -recording magnetometers"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"and cameras, etc. which can de- tect UFOs while submerged. UFO Refueling Operation? From a well-qualified high school teenager I received a UFO report, although not unique, which warrants further investigation. However, this may never happen. My informant stated that a fellow teenager, while • driving to visit his girlfriend in Milford, Ohio, near Cincinnati, on Dec. 16, 1975, was baffled by the sight of two blue . luminous oval- shaped crafts linked together by a tube, at low altitude, over a golf course as though \"refueling.\" The witness said he thought the two lighted crafts were planes refueling, but his ac- count described the two crafts during the link-up as hovering motionlessly, and- making no sound. This seems to rule out aircraft. The boy, who won't allow his name to be used, was described as \"white as a sheet\" when he arrived at his girl- friend's house. The boy, still frightened, refuses to talk a- bout the incident and is un- reachable for more needed data. Abduction Cases In a recent phone chat with Coral Lorenzen of APRO . in Tuc- son, AZ, while.discussing the increasing number of abduction cases, some new, some surfacing after several years of silence, she had this comment: \"The answer to the UFO puzzle may ultimately be in the abduc- tion cases. They can provide the most information if relia- ble, but we must carefully weigh all the evidence to make sure they are not planted or false. In this phase of re- search we are making progress, or let's say were turning a corner. Sometimes . one corner leads to.another corner, but we .have hopes for finding an end in the road.\" . . - On Feb. 9, Mrs. Lorenzen called to relate - that both Travis and brother Duane Walton have passed 100% a polygraph test by a professional firm in Phoenix, AZ: Attending the in- terviews for evaluation with Jim Lorenzen, director of APRO, was Dr. Leo Sprinkle, psycholo- gist, and Dr. Harold Cahn, phy- siologist. Specimens of Travis' hair were sent to a laboratory in California to determine what he \" had ingested during his alleged period of abduction. Miscellaneous Reports The following UFO incidents have been received by MUFON from various sources. They are presented in brief to .keep readers informed of the general UFO activity. Triangular UFO Gene Lundholm of Superior, WI, relates an EM effect inci- dent .caused by a UFO witnessed by a person in his employ, with his two brothers, during the summer of 1975. While driving near Ogena, they spotted a blinking light near the road at low elevation. At first the UFO crossed the road ahead of them, then hov- ered. The driver, pulling off the road, got directly under the object. One witness got out of the car for a good look, observing that the UFO was tri- angular with a light•on the tip of each corner. The object in- stantly moved away, parallel to the highway, then stopped a- gain, hovering on the edge of the. road. Said the principal witness, \"Following the encounter, ,the ..car's speed control wouldn't work. Later we found that all the transistors had been burnt out.\" Comments Lundholm, \"Host interesting is that it was tri- angular- -matching the sightings in Gordon and Two Harbors.\" John Schuessler of Houston, TX, sent in a UFO report dated Oct.'9, 1975, occurring in El Lago about 7:30 p.m. The lone witness, Eileen Cahill, while driving her car home, spotted a motionless object forming a triangle, with a red, white and green light at each corner. As she approached the UFO, she' said it moved forward slow- ly and stopped again. Finally, she drove almost under it and she estimated its elevation at about 200 ft. The UFO's size was about that of a jet fight- er, appeared metallic, and made no sound. Protruding Legs On Sept. 22, 1975, Clara. Tappan of Jackson, WY, reported that an object that looked like an electric light crossed the valley from east to west and disappeared about 5:30 a.m. The UFO was as large as a full moon and, as it neared the witness, four protruding legs were ob- served. There were other UFO reports the same night in Utah and Wyoming. (JACKSON HOLE NEWS, Sept. 25, 1975) Portholes Reported On Sept. 29, 1975, three mem- bers of a Manoa Valley family in Honolulu witnessed a crystal white cigar-shaped object with portholes above their home a- bout 5:30 a.m. Through binocu- lars, at least four portholes were seen emitting light beams. During the UFO's departure, it made a loud noise like a rocket taking off, leaving a red ex- haust flame. The object was observed for about an hour per- forming in tight maneuvers in the. Valley area. (Honolulu STAR-BULLETIN, Sept. 29, 1975) Colorado UFO Aug. 25, 1975, two wedge- shaped, lighted UFOs, fright- ened two Aspen, CO, campers for a four-night period at the 10,000 ft. level in Upper Hunt- er Creek. The UFOs were also seen by 30 policemen and hun- dreds of residents. Also frightened by the nearness of the UFO was the campers' German Shepard. The witnesses described the wedge or triangular-shaped ob- jects as having a row of white Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"lights on the bottom edge and a row of bluish green lights on the upper edge.. The UFOs were first seen flying in formation at dusk, then hover, become dark, then reappear with lights on again at a new location. At one time, one of the UFO's ap- peared close to the campsite and sent down a beam of light. About midnight there was a tre- mendous boom and the objects disappeared. A deputy sheriff and family saw one object fly into a field and disappear be- hind a farm building. (Aspen, CO, TIMES, Sept. 25, 1975) Ground Traces Aug. 31, 1975, Burnt Prairie near Fairfield, IL. No UFO re- ported, but evidence suggests that something came down to land causing an electrical out- age. Twice in one week, a mys- terious circle appeared, in the yard at the Ivan Phillips home. The first sighting of strange \"happenings\" occurred Aug. 31 when Mr. Phillips discovered a perfect circle of burnt grass about 4 inches in diameter within a larger disturbed area in his yard. Three days later, .another circle, the same size, .ap- peared, this time in the drive- way. The inner circle of the disturbed area again was per- fectly round and about 4 inches in diameter. The surface near- by also appeared burnt and three \"tripod leg prints\" were noticeable outside the circle. Said Phillips, \"A UFO investi- gating group came to take pho- tos and samples. One was for- merly a government operative.\" Possibly coincident with the second \"landing\" incident was an electric power failure last- ing for 3 to 4 minutes. (Wayne County PRESS, Sept. 8, 1975) I have a large backlog of UFO. reports on my desk to pre- sent in future columns. To keep the two-way street news aflow, I invite all readers to send me news briefs or sighting reports for future review in SKYLOOK. Address: 4412 Grove Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio 45227 Page 16 New York state Woman drives beneath UFO Location: north of Catskill, NY. Date: Feb. 12, 1976, about 11:45 p.m. Witness: Mrs. Sandra Maldonado. Investigated by: Harold Bates and Gary Levine. Submitted by: Ted Bloecher. Following is an account by Mrs. Sandra Maldonado, who with her husband Edward operate the Step-2 Boutique and beauty par- lor in Catskill, NY: \"I left Catskill, where I had been with friends, at about 11:30 p.m. on the night of Thursday, Feb. 12, 1976, and drove north alone on Vosenkill Road on my way home, a distance of about 4% to 5 miles. The night was clear but dark—no fog--and I had my radio play- ing. Vosenkill Road is a sec- ondary paved road, very winding and full of small sharp hills and dales. I was wearing my prescription tinted glasses be- cause my eyes are sensitive to light. \"I had just passed under some tension power lines and was proceeding up a small rise when I saw a flashing red light di- rectly ahead of me and a short distance away. My first thought was an airplane in trouble and attempting, to land, but as I reached the top of the rise and saw the entire object, I then thought it might be a helicop- ter. \"As I got near it, I realized (with some developing fright) that it was neither a plane nor a \"copter. I slammed on my brakes, turned off my radio and stared, unbelieving, for a mom- ent or so. There the \"thing\" was, hovering motionless di- rectly over the road, just a- bove the utility poles and trees. \"It was as wide as the road (estimated: 25') but was dis- tinguished by a tall mast-like structure on top of a rounded 'dome which made it seem out of proportion to its width. At the top of this skeleton-like mast, was a square \"box\" (with transparent sides) in which a red light revolved (like our firetrucks). \"This was the only light source I saw on it at any time. This light, as it streamed out of the box in all directions, became a soft, but very bright, white light. The object was low enough in my headlights (particularly as I came up over the rise) for me to make out a metallic hull similar in ap- pearance to pewter. \"The configuration was like an inverted bowl on a plate (except for the mast). I saw no openings, hatches, trap- doors, ports—no break at all in the skin. I did notice, how- ever, two concentric half cir- cles of a very intricate design on the side facing me. It stood out in bold relief (see sketch #2). \"By then I was thoroughly frightened, and started up, passing\" beneath the object and accelerating as fast as I could.

Randle's article in SAGA's March issue deals with several instances where Air Force jets have fired on UFOs with both conventional and nu- clear weapons. Other \"shoot- ing\" incidents are also de- tailed. The April issues of STAG and MALE contain questionable arti- cles pertaining to UFOs. As a rule, articles in such maga- zines should not be given much credence, unless the alleged facts can be checked out with more reliable sources. The April (#7) issue of OF- FICIAL UFO has its usual excel- lent lineup of articles by such researchers as Joe Brill, Curt Sutherly, Don Berliner, Hayden Hewes, Raymond E. Fowler, Wen- delle Stevens, Richard Hall, George Friendrich, Don Worley and more, including yours tru- ly. Fowler's article on crashed UFOs is perhaps the outstanding article in this issue. Bernie 0'Conner does good work! John A. Keel's THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is scheduled for March release in a paperback edition from New American Li- brary (Signet Books). The February 3 issue of NA- TIONAL ENQUIRER featured an ar- ticle on UFO sightings in Cali- fornia during August of 1975. The same issue told of a unique college course in Florida, which prepares students' for a \"prob- able meeting\" with creatures from outer space. The February 10 ENQUIRER reported on yet an- other South American teleporta- tion case involving a Brazilian professor who disappeared for four days and was found some 1200 miles away. THE STAR for January 20 told of a UFO \"tracking station\" set up near Bellaire, Michigan by a young electronics expert. The February 17 issue of THE STAR has a brief item on Lake City, PA.'s plans for a Bicentennial Page 18 UFO landing pad, plus a report on some pseudo-UFO sightings in North Carolina which generated some excitement. A new magazine, TRUE FLYING SAUCERS § UFOs QUARTERLY, has just recently appeared on the stands. The first issue is nothing but rehash and the quality will have to improve greatly if the scheduled quar- terly issues are to see print. Collectors of UFO literature may want this one, but data- seekers are advised to look elsewhere. The latest SAGA ANNUAL (not the 1976 UFO ANNUAL) contains a reprint of an article by Ann Slate which appeared in one of the 1975 SAGA issues. The 1976 UFO ANNUAL should also be available on the stands short- lv - The March issue of IN THE KNOW features an interview with Alan Landsburg, author of THE OUTER SPACE CONNECTION and pro- ducer of the movie bearing the same title. An interesting report of a UFO sighting over Chicago ap- pears in the March issue of FATE. The March issue of PROBE THE UNKNOWN contains an article by Curt Sutherly on some airship- like UFOs seen in/around Leban- on, PA, and the \"coincidences\" surrounding the sightings. A November 1975 sighting of a large glowing UFO seen in the area of Madison; Ohio, is feat^ ured in the March 2 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. The ENQUIR- ER issue of March 9 contains statements by NASA scientists on the probability of intelli- gent life in outer space. An article in the March 2 issue of THE STAR focuses on the pro-UFO opinions of astro- nauts James McDiyitt and Gordon Cooper. Their opinions are pre- sented in a new Columbia rec- ord, \"UFOs: The Credibility Factor.\" A three-part series of excerpts from Erich von Dan- iken's new book, MIRACLES OF THE GODS, begins in the March 9 issue of THE STAR, continuing through the March 23 issue. Von Daniken believes religious \"visions\" can be attributed to extraterrestrial intelligences. The March 16 STAR has a small item concerning psychic Page Bryant's book, PSYCHIC IN THE DEVIL'S TRIANGLE, written with James Paul Chapin, and availa- ble from Zebra Books for $1.75. Writer Ila Zeibell tells of UFO sightings and other para- normal phenomena experienced in the company of Uri Geller in an article for the January/Febru- ary issue of PSYCHIC. More ma- terial for the Geller file. The April issue of SAGA pre- sents another article on the \"Devil's Sea\" of the Pacific. This contains some questionable material. John Keel's column in this issue deals with the legend of Lucifer and the sup- posed exploded planet between Mars and Jupiter. The April issue of UFO REPORT is the first bi-monthly issue of this magazine and contains some interesting material, as usual. Contributors include B. Ann Slate, Jerome Clark, Char- les Bowen, Brinsley Le Poer . Trench and others. Excerpted material from Brad Steiger's MYSTERIES OF TIME AND SPACE appears in the May issue of BEYOND REALITY. The May issue of PROBE THE UNKNOWN contains a rehash arti- cle on the Travis Walton abduc- tion case. Another excellent addition to the ranks of UFO magazines is UFOLOGY, -the quarterly pub- lication of the International UFO Registry. The Spring issue is now available on the larger newsstands. Very nicely-done, with slick covers and good ma- terial, UFOLOGY is also availa- ble by subscription ($4.00 per year) from: P. 0. Box 3073 - Munster, Indiana 46321. Highly recommended."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Director's Message . . •• ..' :' ,..\\ : \"-.O Foreign Reports Richard H. Hall, internation- al coordinator, is preparing a one-page information sheet that will be mailed to all of MU- FON's foreign representatives, listing the names and addresses of specialists in the different fields of UFO research. Cases will be mailed direct- ly to the specialists for pre- liminary screening. Each will in turn provide comments not only to the originator of the report, but to Richard Hall and to the international director, Walt Andrus, with suggestions for more detailed study or fol- low-up . The following people have been designated at this time to receive such reports. This list will be revised periodically as the need exists. David F. Webb, humanoid/oc- cupants; Ted Phillips, physical landing traces; James M. Mc- Campbell, electro-magnetic ef- fects; John L. Warren, Ph.D., artifacts for physical/chemical analysis; William H, Bryce, M. D., physiological/medical ef- fects; Grey M. Woodman, M.D., physiological/parapsychological cases; William H. Spaulding, photographic analysis; Ray Stanford, instrumentation/radar cases; and Lawrence A. Lacey, D.V.M., animal effect cases. A current list of foreign representatives has been devel- oped to reflect those who have been actively involved through the combined efforts of Joe Brill, Carolyn Connelly and Richard Hall. As director for investiga- tions, Ray Fowler has proposed a State Director's Monthly UFO Report Form as a means of se- curing a tabulation of the UFO reports investigated or pending in each state. Ray has been given a current list of the names and addresses of all of the state directors. In those By Walt Andrus states where a state director has not been appointed, the name of a state section direc- tor has been submitted as an alternate. Each of you will be contacted directly by Ray to initiate this much-needed program. Ray, in turn, will prepare a compos- ite report for publication in SKYLOOK for use by consultants and investigators. We solicit your cooperation in making this essential research successful. State Meetings The success of MUFON, as an organization, may be attributed directly to the leadership ef- forts of state and state sec- tion directors. State meetings conducted by the state direc- tors to specifically train field investigators and state section directors have been conducted throughout the United States as well as by the MUFON Central European Section in Muni ch, Germany. On Sunday, Feb. 22, Lou Ma- sonick and Ronald Anderson, state directors respectively for Minnesota and Wisconsin, conducted a fine training meet- ing at Lou's home in St. Paul, as reported by Ray Warren, state section director. Such meetings have also been held by the Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Hampshire, and New York state directors. We encourage all directors to consider this means of train- ing their people and to get better acquainted. Teamwork and cooperation in UFO research will make greater strides through these meetings. Active NICAP and APRO field investi- gators have also attended these meetings as a means of exchang- ing their knowledge and ex- perience with MUFON personnel. Mini-symposiums planned In addition to MUFON's Na- tional 1976 UFO Symposium in Ann Arbor, MI, on June 12 and 13, other \"mini-symposiums\" or conferences are planned from coast to coast. MUFON of Kansas City, under the guidance of Stan Fouch and Tom Nicholl, is having a pro- gram on Saturday, March 27, at the Midland Theater featuring Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Ted Phillips as speakers. Your di- rector will chair the question and answer period for both the morning and afternoon sessions. Another is planned in the near future at the University of Vincennes in Indiana and al- so Foothills Community College in Los Altos Hills, CA, to name a few. Rosetta and Dick Holmes will be hosts with the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis at their annual picnic and sky- watch on July 10 and 11 at Car- lyle, II. New Personnel New state section directors appointed this month include the following: A. V. McDowell, P.O. Box 1545, Big Spring, TX 79720 for Howard, Glasscock, Martin, Mitchell, Borden and Sterling Counties. He is a former state section director from Montana and may be contac- ted by telephone at (915) 263- 7150. S. Thompson Viele, 31 Long Sands Road, York, Maine 03909; telephone (207) 363-2704, for York and Cumberland counties. In Pennsylvania, William Mecca, 1527 Madison Avenue, Dunmore, PA 18512; telephone: (717) 346- 3635, has been assigned to Lackawana and Wyoming counties.

It will be titled, \"The UFO Con- nection.\" David Dunn Productions in Hollywood and Las Vegas has filmed their first weekly syn- dicated television program, un- titled as yet. It will be 30 minutes in length, consisting of 3 or 4 segments per show, with at least one segment de- voted to UFQs in a news/docu- mentary/interview format. Gene Marvin is program coordinator. Gene and his wife attended the MUFON exhibit and-lectures at the \"Electronics World Exposi- tion\" in Kansas City, MO, two years ago.. MUFON has pledged its support to this ambitious undertaking also. Deputy Director Resigns It is with deep regret that MUFON accepted the resignation of John F. Schuessler as deputy director. His \"open letter\" 'was published in the February issue of SKYLOOK voicing his dissat- isfaction and disappointment in the progress to date in resolv- ing the UFO phenomenon. He was instrumental in found- ing MUFON in May, 1969. A new deputy director will be elected at our annual corporate meeting in Ann Arbor, MI, on June 13, 1976. John will continue to attack this perplexing problem through all channels at his disposal. He plans to maintain his asso- ciation with MUFON, ..serving as a con-smltant in astronautics and as a field-investigator in the Hous>ton>.,Vjexas,' area. Page 20 Recapping and comro By Richard Hall Reports of humanoid and not- so-humanoid creatures are one of the more baffling aspects of the UFO mystery. They requrie Surely the Acevedo case (April 14, 1974, Tandil, Argen- tina) must be one of the most remarkable UFO cases on record in terms of the significant features it contains (light beam, paralysis, levitation, heat, physiological effects, physical evidence and E-M ef- fect, and a related humanoid report). The \"semi-illiterate\" witness is, in a way, an advan- tage since if this description is valid it is not likely that he is familiar with UFO litera- ture. Also, from the quotes attributed to him, he is not unintelligent. With all this detail, physical evidence, par- tially confirming and separate witnesses, the case seems de- serving of being written up in full, complete with documenta- tion from the, electric company, and with , maps and diagrams. Perhaps the!.QtlFE group in-•Tan- dil has alre'ady done this; if not, I hope.they will, thorough, > cross-disciplinary investigation and, more so than comparatively routine reports, validation. The MUFON special- ists in this area, Ted Bloecher and Dave Webb, 'are taking a commendable appyoach by compil- ing naturalistic observations, cross-checking, the data insofar as possible, and avoiding undue speculation. The luminous humanoids re- ported near Alton, Illinois, last October are not without precedent. Bloecher and Webb probably can cite other paral- lels, but the following refer- ences from THE HUMANOIDS (Reg- nery, 1969) indicate a history of luminous beings sometimes associated with UFOs: October 20, 1954, near Como, Italy, a 1.3 m tall being in a luminous suit aimed a beam at the witness, who was paralyzed (p. 51). October 10, 1957, near Quebracoco, Brazil, an ovai. l was seen with seven small be- 1 ' 1 ings in luminous steits gazing down at the witnesses through an open \"hatch\" (p. 100). Aug- ust 20, 1965, Cuzco, Peru, tW beings of \"dazzling^ brightness\" emerged from a silvery disc lh m in diameter (p, 119). AS these examples show, the lum- inous humanoids also display other familiar UFO features. The stiff-legged gait and single-file depa*e;ur.e in the Illinois case are features that have also appeared* in previous humanoid reports. The stra%e A silence is a feature worth not- ing; any indications of changes . in atmospheric pressure, sound, temperature, etc. in the pres- ence of a UFO event could be important clues. Nbte the No- vember 4, 1975, \"silence\" case reported by Len Stringfiel'd 'On page 6 of this issue. Notes By Mark R.
