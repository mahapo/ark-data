FROM THE EDITOR The December 1984 edition marks the two hundredth issue of SKYLOOK and the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, since its founding in September 1967. Starting as a five page mimeographed newsletter, SKYLOOK gradually expanded to a twenty-page monthly magazine under the leadership of its editor, Mrs. Norma E. Short. After nurturing SKYLOOK from its inception, Mrs. Short relinquished the editorship with her last issue number 74 in January 1974. SKYLOOK, The UFO Monthly, adopted a more professional magazine appearance with the February 1974 issue when Dwight Connelly became editor and publisher. Under Dwight's direction, SKYLOOK was recognized as one of the leading monthly UFO publications. With the June 1976 edition, the name of the magazine was changed to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL to better identify the purposes and work of the Mutual UFO Network under Dennis W. Hauck as editor. Typesetting of the Journal at this time further upgraded the caliber of our publication. Mr. Hauck turned the reigns of editorship over to Richard H. Hall after the August 1977 issue number 117. The Journal reached new heights of professionalism, thanks to Dick Hall, who spearheaded our publication from September of 1977 through July 1983. From October 1983 through September 1984, Robert V. \"Bob\" Pratt, a professional UFO investigator/journalist, served as the Journal editor. All of us in MUFON would like to take this opportunity to thank these wonderful people for their dedicated service as we mark this significant milestone in ufology â€” our two hundredth edition.

'NS"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE EARTHLIGHT ENIGMA By Hilary Evans Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena London, England There is one category of unidentified flying something which has been reported for decades, even centuries; long enough to pass into folklore. Variously known as mountain lights, spook lights and the like, it is a recognized anomaly which, though most researchers would attribute it to natural causes of some kind, continues to defy research. Knowing into which pigeonhole it is most likely to eventually fit is a long way from saying what it is made of and what causes it. A number of researchers have of course speculated that these lights may be linked with the UFO phenomenon. Some investigators, such as Ralph Lael, have allegedly traced an extraterrestrial connection; but their evidence is not such as to win instant credibility with the scientific establishment. More persuasively, Michael Persinger, a psychologist, and Paul Devcreux, a respected anomaly researcher, have offered us interesting speculations based on statistical correlations. Some researchers have enthusiastically espoused their hypotheses as the breakthrough we have all been waiting for: others argue that even if valid their models could accounts for. only a small percentage of reports. x At this early stage of the debate, either viewpoint can be justified. There is probably no area of UFO research so vulnerable to criticism as its statistical base; but Devereux has persuasively established at least a degree of correlation between geophysical events and UFO reports. He has been less successful at winning adherents for his model of how the first, lead to the second. However, who will blame him for that, in the present state of our ignorance? He deserves our thanks, rather, for providing some support for the viewpoint expressed back in 1975 by Jacques Vallee, that the \"UFO phenomenon is the product of a technology that integrates physical and psychic phenomena.\" Some of us may not be too happy about Vallee's use of the word \"psychic\" where \"psychological\" might have served; no doubt it's just a matter of definition. . What is regrettably true is that many of us need to be reminded to be open- minded in these matters, and to recognize that some kind of synthesis between the feet-on-the-ground physical and the head-in-the-clouds psychological is essential if we aren't to get bogged down, in futile debate between the good old nuts-and-bolts boys and the smart-ass skeptics of the psychosbcial persuasion. The futility of such all-or-nothing debate has been demonstrated recently in regard to two potentially important cases, the' on-going sightings in Hessdalen, Norway, and Rutledge's Project Identification which seems to have faltered to a standstill without anyone taking up the challenge. In both cases there are many debatable issues; what is dismaying is the failure of many researchers to get beneath these superficial issues , to the underlying significance of the phenomena. Just by way of example: a representative of Norway's ulta-skeptical NIVFO wrote me \"the UFOs are now IFOs: the lights in Hessdalen were....airplane lights, stars, inversions, ball lights, plasma lights, etc.\" No doubt some can be dismissed as aircraft and stars; but to dismiss, just as casually, others as \"ball lights\" or \"plasma lights,\" supposing that you have explained them from UFOs into IFOs, is absurdly naive. Fortunately, his statement has not convinced the dedicated researchers of UFO-Norge that they can pack up their detectors and go home. At the same time, the NIVFO skeptics also have some validity in their view that many of the Hessdalen witnesses saw something other than what they reported seeing. To accept their reports at face value would be equally naive. What we have to do is to pick out, both from the reports and from our knowledge of what processes may be involved, the requisite elements for creating a testable working hypothesis. And if it seems unavoidable that such a hypothesis will contain some ingredients that are purely physical and some that are psychological, and even some that would be classified by many as parapsychological, well, that too is something we must be prepared to accept. TOWARDS A VALID SYNTHESIS I use the word \"must\" advisedly, not out of any desire to dragoon UFO researchers into a course of action they may be reluctant to pursue,, but because 1 cannot see how any ufologist can deny, on the one hand, the physical reality of some UFOs, and on the other, the action of psycholgocial processes in modifying the way in which those UFOs are perceived. The Hessdalen photographs are sufficient evidence of the first, the findings of Allan Hendry of the second. Those of us who are willing to accept the necessity for some kind of synthesis will surely find that the prospect, while daunting, is extremely promising. It could even be that breakthrough which is always just around the corner; maybe at last we have turned that corner. Let us start with the reported phenomenon, an object, generally seen in the act of flying, which we can reasonably assume to be physical in nature. and either geophysical or meteorological (maybe the terms are interchangeable here) in origin. Let us provisionally call it a Ball-of-Light, BOL for short. There is no reason for us to doubt that the BOL is generated by a (continued on following page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Earthlight Enigma, Continued perfectly natural process: we don't know what that process is, but we don't have to presuppose anything that science, in the fulness of time, won't feel able to take to its bosom without compunction. Most of us, seeing a BOL,.will say Look, there's a ball of light, how odd, and start looking for an explanation in geophysical or meteorlogical terms, because we are sensible, level-headed people. But if Devereux is right, there are others who see these BOLs as UFOs, by which they don't just mean amorphous shapes, but something structured,, of, the order of alien spacecraft. We all know, after reading Hendry, that this kind of extrapolation happens; we know that people can see the Moon, or Venus, and suppose it to be a metallic disk with rotating lights; windows and all manners of accessories. So there is, nothing implausible about the Devereux. proposal that a geophysical BOL may do what the Moon does, and trigger off such a delusion. Of course that still leaves a number of unresolved questions; one of those is, Why do some people think they see a structured craft while others see just an amorphous light? (As has happened on countless occasions at He'ssdalen, for example.) Well, one possible answer is supplied when we turn to an apparently quite separate train of conjecture, involving a whole new set of factors. It has. been clearly established that our brains can be affected by atmospheric effects, such as imminent storms, and by geophysical events, such as imminent earthquakes. The modus operand! of these effects appears to be a modification in the proportion of charged particles in the atmosphere, involving either an alteration in the balance between negative and positive ions, or a reduction or increase of one or the other. Sulman has demonstrated that about one person in three is \"weather-sensitive\" to such effects, to the extent that their behavior will be unconsciously affected. It is indeed possible that these effects could go so far as to trigger off a hallucination. Claude Rifat has tentatively â€¢ identified a component of the brain which seems to function as a kind of switch from the \"reality mode\" to the \"fantasy mode.\" As is well known,.the brain is an electro-chemical device, requiring minuscule quantities of power to operate: it is plausible, therefore, that the input generated by the aforementioned atmospheric effects could be sufficient to activate Rifat's switch: in which case the geophysical or meteorological event could, directly cause the percipient to hallucinate. At first it looks as though we now have not one but two hypotheses on our hands: one says that a geo/meteo event can create a physical BOL which may be mistaken by some percipients for an alien spacecraft; the other says that a geo/meteo event can so affect the brains of some people that they are liable to hallucinate. Well, you don't have to be frightfully clever to see how these two hypotheses could be telescoped, as follows: the geo/meteo event puts a certain number of people â€” about one person in three â€” into a state of mind where they are liable to hallucinate. .At the same time, it may generate a physical BOL which may act as a trigger for such a hallucination. So while two out of three people see a perfectly natural object, their companion sees a structured artifact from Outer Space. NO OFFENCE TO SCIENCE As a starting-point for further research, this proposal may, I suggest, provide an explanation for a limited number of UFO reports: I am far from suggesting that it offers any kind of blanket explanation for the entire phenomenon. And in any case there are several, questions which arise. For instance: *Are there any other circumstances in which similar double effects may occur? For example, such electromagnetic field effects as might be encountered close to power lines, or in the vicinity of high-tech government projects which could involve electromagnetic forces? *Should we take into account the subjective impressions of many percipients, that the BOLs respond to them with signs of .intelligence? â€¢ Reluctant as we may be to accept such a notion, it has been reported by so many people that we would be acting unscientifically to dismiss it altogether. Hendry has shown that IFOs generate the same kind of subjective feelings as \"true\" UFOs; but before we discount the whole idea we must explain how both Rutledge in Missouri and Havik in Norway became convinced that their UFOs. .were responding to the investigators' activities. *Another possibility we should consider is whether the BOL itself may effect the atmosphere in its. vincinity, modifying it in just the same way as the geo/meteo . event which caused the BOL itself? After all, we don't know what exactly it is in the geophysical or meteorological event which causes the variation in charged particles; but whatever it is, it may be no less inherent in the BOL. In which case it will be the \"BOL-UFO\" itself which causes one percipient in three to see it, not as the 'ball of.light which it really is, but as something else. That \"something else\" will be determined by factors operating within the subconscious mind of the percipient, and will be shaped by psychological and cultural expect- ations, hopes, fears and preoccupa- tions. For some at least, it will resolve itself into an alien spaceship. It is, at this early phase of our research, a confusing picture. But it possesses one important merit: it is made up entirely of elements which are either reported facts or proven processes. In other words, there is nothing among the component parts of the model which could cause offence to current science. It is only the combination of these component parts which takes us into unexplored territory. It is a territory which promises to. repay exploration, '.but only if explorers from various disciplines are willing to join forces. There are physical forces involved which are nominally the province of the geologist or the meteorologist; but there are also mental processes at work which are the domain of the psychologist, the neurologist and the sociologist. In short, here is a phenomenon which reminds. us that the categories into (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Earthlight Enigma, Continued which we humans are apt to separate our knowledge are largely artificial.

STAN GORDON The Pennsylvania Association For the Study of the Unexplained (PASU) is investigating the sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object by a pilot and co-pilot of a corporation Lear jet, on the night of .July 27, 1984, over Clarion County, Pennsylvania. The two observers, who wish not to be identified (this information is on file with MUFON), were enroute from New York state to Pittsburgh when the sighting occurred at about 11:30 PM. From information extracted from the taped interview with the pilot, the crew was looking out the right, windshield, toward the west when they noticed a bright streak of light descending down at a 45 degree angle then leveling out. At first they thought it was a bright meteor but after they saw it level out, they noticed more detail and realized that the object seemed to be keeping level at the same altitude with them, as though it was pacing their aircraft. The object appeared to be between 40 to 50 feet long, shaped like a cylinder (or rocket as mentioned in the pilot's signed statement), solid and black in appearance. As they watched the object, from the rear section a bright reddish-orange burst of flame was emitted. This flame was very bright in color \"like the flame of a torch,\" was of a pointed shape and extended out about 50 to 60 feet from the object. This bright flame was seen to burst on and off 3 to 4 times during the two minute observation. Each burst seemed to last between 3 to 5 seconds. . After, each burst of flame there were numerous sparks observed that lasted several seconds then disappeared. Another aircraft in the same vicinity radioed to the air traffic control center at Cleveland, Ohio, just after our witnesses did. Both requested information on any other air traffic in their vicinity. They were told that radar indicated no other traffic. The sighting occurred in the vicinity of the Clarion, Pa., VOR. No interference was noted on the aircraft instrumentation. The pilot has been flying for 8 years and has never seen anything like this before. One thing that baffled the two observers was that even though they were moving in the opposite direction of the UFO, the object still seemed to keep pace with them. When asked how they could see the object for that length of time if they were moving in opposite directions, the pilot replied \"I don't understand it myself unless it could go backwards. Cause the flames that seemed to keep it moving was behind it. We were on a heading towards Pittsburgh, and it was going in the opposite direction towards the northwest. As we were descending in altitude it was just always with us. Like it was going backwards. The flame would shoot out and it would just stay with us.\"   n HILARY EVANS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"HUGE SAUCER OVER PENNSYLVANIA By T. Scott Crain, Jr. State Section Director for Pennsylvania On the night of October 23, 1984, Melvin Morrissey was driving along Route 453, one-and-a-half miles north of Tyrone, Pennsylvania, when he saw an object he described as \"a circular shape like a saucer.\" Morrissey was on his way to spot for deer in his pick-up truck at 8:18 PM EST along the Jamesville Pike Road , one mile from his home, when he saw a series of lights in the sky out of his passenger side window. Morrissey said the saucer-looking craft had a rim of \"red lights on top of it going in sequence around the object,\" and at least three amber lights underneath the craft that were stationary. According to Morrissey, the object was \"the size of a football field,\" and \"was roughly 100 feet above the treetops, maybe a little higher.\" The witness pulled off to the side of the road, turned off his engine, and leaned his head out the truck window to get a better look. \"I couldn't hear a thing. It was moving faster than a plane, but not as fast as a jet\" Morrissey said. He observed the object for at least two minutes before it coasted over the road in front of him and disappeared over the ridge in a northwesterly direction.. Several minutes later, Morrissey returned home to get his two children and go look for the object. They all proceeded back on to the Jamesville Pike, and turned off on the first dirt road past Wild Goose Road. About three miles back in the Gamelands Number 158 Morrissey saw unusual lights near the ground which he said he never saw before. He was observing them through binoculars from the bed of his pick-up truck. Morrissey returned to Tyrone and reported his sighting to Tyrone Police who then informed Holidaysburg State Police. Tyrone Police Chief J. Thomas Cooper, Morrissey, and members of the State Police returned to the area where Morrissey said he saw the lights. None could be found. The next day (October 24), Police Chief Cooper and Morrissey drove to another vantage point on Wbpson- onock Mountain for clues to what may have caused the lights Morrissey saw near the ground. Cooper concluded the UFO seen in the Gamelands was the red lights on the WTAJ-TV tower located on top of Wopsononock. A spokesman for WTAF informed me some added lights were attached to the tower several months before, and with the fall leaves coming off, those lights are visible from the Gamelands. Morrissey confirmed to this .investigator on Sunday (October 28), that he went back to the point where he was Tuesday night at the Gamelands and he too, saw those lights again. However, the misconception of the lights in the. Gamelands does not explain the saucer-shaped object Morrissey said he saw fly over his car on Jamesville Pike.

I was the first person to reach Morrissey the day following his sighting with whom he was willing to discuss the incident. He has since released details of his sightings to the newspapers.

The answer was no; however, the lady at NORAD said that the press were calling from Central Illinois to MELVIN MORRISSEY Completing MUFON Sighting Questionnaire check if any military aircraft were in their area at 6:00 AM on October 23, the same day as Morrissey's UFO sighting.

This investigator was in the Gamelands area between 1:30 and 3:30 PM the next day and saw nothing unusual. Other UFO sightings were reported in the vicinity the night of Morrissey's sighting. Morrissey himself received calls on three separate sightings seen the same night as his. As far as I could ascertain, none of the other UFO reports were similar to that of Morrissey's. Morrissey's original sighting remains unidentified at the time of this writing.   Q"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A STATISTICAL REPORT ON UFO ARDUCTION INVESTIGATIONS IN THE NEW YORK CITY AREA By Budd Hopkins By the end of 1977 Ted Bloecher and I had received a few UFO sighting accounts which contained intriguing pieces of \"missing time.\" We came to suspect that some of these reports concealed unremembered UFO abduction experiences, and in January of 1978 we began to use hypnosis to unlock any hidden memories that may lay buried in the witnesses' unconscious. Many investigators have asked for some kind of statistical breakdown of our ongoing case studies, and this short article is an attempt to answer their requests. This investigative team â€” the \"New York Group\" â€” included, centrally, Bloecher, Martin Jackson and myself. 1 In addition six people have served as hypnotists â€” three psychiatrists, two psychologists, and one psychologically-trained police hypnotist. Two other psychiatrists, two psychologists and a neuro-surgeon have also served as consultants at various times. Since our beginnings in 1978, twenty-five subjects have presented us with relatively full UFO abduction accounts. 2 It is very important to note that 20% of these gave full accounts of their experiences with no hypnosis having been employ- ed; they simply remembered their experiences consciously, \"normally\" as it were. There are no apparent differences in abduction accounts recalled naturally and those recalled with the aid of hypnosis. A majority of the remaining twenty also had either partial recollection or dream-like \"flashback\" recall of portions of their abduction experiences. Hypnosis, however, helped bring back relatively full recollections of their abductions; And so: Group 1 consists of five abductees who recalled their abductions fully, without the use of hypnosis. Group 2 consists of twenty subjects who recalled their abduction experiences with the aid of hypnosis. Group 3 consists of thirteen individuals, each of whom has recalled under hypnosis events which strongly suggest buried abduction experiences, though for these thirteen the \"full scenario\" was incompletely recalled. One woman, for example, recalls waking one night, feeling paralyzed, and then sensing \"a presence\" in the bedroom. Next she recalls being flooded with white light, and lying in a brightly-lit space with a high ceiling. Because she does not remember \"beings\" or any other specific visual detail, her case falls into group 3. (There are other indications, in this and each of the other twelve cases that an abduction did take place, though time and space limitations preclude my detailing them here). Included in this group are several cases in which the subjects appear to have profound resistance to hypnotically-produced recollection, despite a wealth of clues pointing to an abduction: missing time associated with a UFO sighting, physical traces, \"abduction dreams,\" etc. The thirteen subjects included in this group are, in my opinion, almost certainly victims of the UFO abduction experience. ABDUCTION PARAMETERS One of our most persistent quests is the search for limits â€” for edges arid boundaries to the abduction phenomenon. We have consequently employed hypnosis in what might seem to be marginal cases, instances in which the subject might have had only a \"vague feeling\" that he or she has had an abduction experience, or may have nothing more than a fear of a certain location or stretch of highway, and so on. Some of these vague feelings have yielded what we believe are genuine abduction experiences; some have yielded nothing. The result of our having spread so wide a net is a fourth group. Group 4 consists of eleven subjects who have been hypnotized, yet seem clearly not to have had any kind of abduction experience. Thus, of the 43 individuals comprising the last three groups of hypnotized subjects, fully 25% produced no abduction account, nor any sign of any buried experience. Despite their â€” and sometimes our â€” suspicion that they may have been abducted, and despite their obvious, unavoidable, unconscious interest in producing such an account, 25% of our hypnotized subjects came up with no such recollections. It is possible, of course, that some of these. eleven are repressing real abduction experiences, but that is neither their, nor my, opinion. This finding is a powerful rebuke to those who constantly insist upon the \"lead-ability\" of hypnotic subjects in UFO investigations. In truly marginal cases, where only a few clues exist to suggest a buried UFO abduction, a few genuine abduction accounts do surface, but the majority of hypnotic subjects in such cases do not recall any such experience. A few have been supplied mundane explanations for their memories or \"feeling traces.\" ABDUCTEES Group 5 includes thirty people whom I, alone or with Ted Bloecher or Martin Jackson, have interviewed in person, often at their homes or at the sites of their experiences, and whom we believe have most probably had abduction encounters. None of these people, however, have been hypnotized for a variety of reasons, yet in all thirty cases there are clear indications of buried abduction experiences. For example, one man recalls seeing a UFO descending over his parked automobile, after which he experienced a two-hour period of (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Statistical Report, continued from page 7 missing time and a \"flash-back\" memory of being carried into a landed UFO. (Separately, his companion in the same car recalled a full abduction scenario, and so I have included him in Group 1.) Another man has a childhood scar of unknown origin associated with a UFO sighting and time lapse, and two subsequent periods of missing time, plus flash-back recollections of a landed UFO and its occupants. At least eight of these thirty have childhood scars associated with periods of missing time. The evidence in each of these thirty cases is very strong. Some of these people, however, resist any further investigation into their cases, and/or reject the idea of undergoing hypnosis. Some have moved away from the New York area, and a .few are now unavailable for reasons of health. The remainder .we intend to investigate fully, as time permits. Group 6, the largest, consists of those whom I have only interviewed by telephone, or written to, in answer to their letters or calls to me. As a result of the note at the end of my book Missing Time, I have received hundreds of letters from people around the world. Many have questions or observations to make, but many relate their own possible UFO abduction experiences. A number of these have been investigated first hand, and are included in the earlier groups, but many, many other cases have yet to be looked into. I have appeared on various radio call-in programs, where still other possible abduction cases have surfaced. I have no record of how many such phone and letter exchanges have taken place, but a conservative guess is that over one hundred of these deserve to be investigated as possible abduction cases. All of this convinces me that the phenomenon is not a rare one. Incredible though it may seem, thousands upon thousands of UFO abduction accounts apparently litter the psychic landscape. I once discussed these statistical categories with veteran poll-taker Daniel Yankelovich, and he was in complete agreement; based 8 upon my sample, the numbers of abduction accounts abroad in the land must be enormous. The implications, if these accounts turn out to be largely genuine, are truly staggering. To recapitulate our statistics: Abduction cases investigated: 1. Those recalled without the use of hypnosis  5 2. Those recalled with the aid of hypnosis  20 3. Highly probable, though as yet unresolved cases investigated with the aid of hypnosis  13 4. Cases investigated with the use of hypnosis which strongly suggest no abuction experience  11 5. Highly probable, though as yet inconclusive cases, investigated without, the use of hypnosis.... 30 TOTAL OF INVESTIGATED, HIGHLY PROBABLE ABDUCTION ACCOUNTS  68. 1. Ted Bloecher is no longer active in this group. A number of other investigators have helped us at various times, including some, like SBI's Pete Mazzola, not associated with MUFON or CUFOS. 2. This is not the place to discuss the evidence in these various accounts, nor how we arrived at our various evaluations. For a fuller view of these issues, see my book Missing Time in which a number of the cases included in these statistics are described at length. A \"full abduction scenario\" is meant to include descriptions of the physical circumstances before the abduction, a description of the UFO and its occupants, and some description of the quasi-medical procedures carried out on the abductee. All the cases described in this paper are abduction reports whose validity I have found no reason to doubt.

To recap some of the basic information on the case for those readers not familiar with it, Mrs. Catherine Burk, 67, was returning to. her home in Bellwood after visiting with her family in Altoona. It was about 8:30 or 9 PM, the sky was dark and overcast as if going to rain. She was driving her 1976 Chevrolet Malibu north on Route 220 and had reduced her speed to about 35 miles per hour as she approached the Bellwood turnoff. ENCOUNTER It was at this point that she became aware of a loud, whirling sound coming from her right side. She looked through the passenger window and observed a bright, silvery, saucer-shaped object that was flat on top, but having a protruding hemisphere on the middle of the bottom. The object was estimated by the witness as being approximately 24 feet in diameter, and about 30 feet off the ground. There were no windows or lights apparent and the silver luminescent color of the object remained at the same intensity. The object then passed over the car moving right to left, causing the right side of the car to be lifted off the ground about two to three feet. Mrs. Burk was forced against her side of the car at this point, as the car continued forward at a slow speed. Mrs. Burk grabbed the steering wheel and tried the brakes but neither mechanism would respond. The headlights of the car were blinking on and off when the vehicle was in the air. During this time Mrs. Burk attempted to slide over to the passenger side of the car to use her weight to bring the car back down, but she could not overcome the incline and kept sliding back over onto her seat. The car did go down for an instant, then went back up into the air a second time. CATHERINE BURK, Note Neck Support Due To Injury Mrs. Burk feels that at this point the object made a slight turn forward and released its hold of the car. The car came down with a strong thud, forcing Mrs. Burk under the steering wheel and hitting her shoulder on the dashboard. She feels the entire time the car was lifted in the air was only three to four seconds. The car stalled out immediately after it hit the ground. After Mrs. Burk regained her composure she attempted to start the car. PHYSICAL EFFECTS It took between 20 to 25 minutes to start the car engine. Mrs. Burk saw no other cars pass during the incident. Other possible sightings of UFOs were reported in the same area during the night of the sighting. Since the incident, Mrs. Burk has suffered from various physical ailments. Some of these ailments have included loss of hearing in her right ear, loss of hair from the head area, sores that frequently come and go in the head area, pain in the right arm and shoulder as well as the neck area, severe headaches that sometimes last for days, small blisters on various parts of the body which are red in color, and burn until they go away, irritation and swelling of the feet, extensive nervousness arid dizziness, black and blue marks that appear unaccountably, vision problems such as small black dots appearing in front of the eyes and a worsening heart condition. Mrs. Burk has been under the cars of several doctors due to the various conditions described. She feels most of her physical problems are a result of her UFO encounter. Due to the substantial medical bill that resulted from her hospitalization after the incident, Mrs. Burk filed a physical injury claim with a major insurance company. She told them that her injury and the damage done to her car were caused by an Unidentified Flying Object. In November of 1983,1 was contacted by (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Bellwood Update, Continued the insurance company asking my opinion of the case. They also requested copies of all investigative information that we had obtained on the incident so that they could better evaluate the matter. All requested material was submitted to their office. The insurance representative informed me that this was the strangest claim that had ever crossed, his desk. Unfortunately he met with Mrs. Burk a short time later and stated that it was the decision of the company that what- ever happened to her was an act of God. I have been in touch with Mrs. Burk continually since the occurrence. As of October of 1984, she still continues to have medical problems. She'has regained partial hearing in her right ear but has sharp pains in it at times. She still experiences severe â€¢headaches as well as many of the other symptoms mentioned previously. In September another type .of unusual skin ailment began to plague Mrs. Burk. . Bright red patches that do not itch but burn have been appearing on her arms, legs and back. After the red patches disappear,, they leave behind a brown mark that remains a long time on the skin. Mrs. Burk has gone to two dermatologists as well as her family doctor, but they have been unable to find what is causing it. Mrs; Burk claims that one doctor told her \"to be honest with you, I've never seen anything like it before.\" We have attempted to obtain medical records from the hospital and the doctors involved. We have now .made formal requests with the aid of Mrs. Burk so that these records might be studied by specialists in this field. OTHER INVESTIGATORS? On a more unusual note, it is apparent that someone other than civilian UFO researchers are interested in this case. A few days after the UFO encounter, a story on the incident appeared in the Altoona paper: That same night a man in a suit driving a dark, navy blue car arrived outside of the residence where Mrs. Burk had her car parked. The man was carrying a tray with numerous strips of tape in it. 10 â€¢K- 24' DIRECTION! Bright silver disc.. . Flat on top. Hemisphere on bottom. 30 FT. Car lifted on 2 wheels . for 3 seconds approximately 2 to 3 feet 'off the road He proceeded to attach the strips to various sections of the car, then took them off and put them into the tray. Mrs. Burk's neighbor was the first to ,see this man and call him to the attention of Mrs. Burk. She then went outside and asked him what he was doing. He said that he didn't need her assistance, that he would be done shortly and he wasn't going to hurt her car. A few minutes later he left the area. In early November Mrs. Burk was awakened by noise outside her home at 6:30 AM. She looked outside to see two men dressed in suits who once again were attaching sections of tape to her car. One man was described as being about 30 years old, dressed in a blue suit with a blue shirt and tie. The other man, who did all the talking, was about 50 to 55 years old and dressed in a blue suit with a white shirt and tie. He seemed to have a broken English accent that Mrs. Burk couldn't place. The men arrived in a dark, navy blue car with a white license plate. She said it was definitely not a Pennsylvania license, but she could not see any other detail since it was barely light outside. She said that neither of these men was the same one who had visited her earlier. She again asked them what they were doing. The older man was very stern.and let her know that he was the boss. He told Mrs. Burk to go back inside that they would not harm her car. She watched them from the window the entire time they were there. They spent between Y 2 to % of an hour working around the car. Both men had metal trays and rolls of tape. One man started in the front of the car, while the other man worked from the back. They covered every section of the .car, including the windows. Their procedure was to tear off a section of .tape, place it over a specific area of the car, then remove it and place it in the tray. When the tray was full, they would put it in the trunk of the car,, then start a new tray. After the men left on that.date they have not returned. Another interesting note is that all correspondence from Mrs. Burk either to myself or other known investigators dealing with the case never arrived by mail. This happened on several occasions. Only recently did I receive my first letter from Mrs. Burk and this was sent by return receipt, certified mail.    D"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"TOWARDS TRUTH By Walt Andrus In November 1983, Bob Pratt, then Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, asked John F. Schuessler to write an article stating his personal evaluation or an estimate of the situation of Ufology in 1984. Mr. Schuessler's article was featured in the January 1984 edition of the Journal (issue number 191). The title of the article was aptly selected as \"Estimate of the Situation 1984--The (Sad?) State of Ufology.\" Based upon John's nineteen years of UFO experience and his professional status in the aerospace industry, who is better qualified to provide an un-biased view? Even though he is.the Deputy Director of MUFON, he was critical of weaknesses within the Mutual UFO Network. As the International Director of MUFON, I have taken John's constructive criticism under advisement and heeded his recommendations for improvement, thus making our organization even better and closer to the \"grass roots\" level that has made us so successful during the past fifteen years. APRO ARTICLE In the most recent issue of the APRO Bulletin Volume 32 No. 7, two and three-fourths pages of the eight- page issue are devoted to an article titled \"Ufology-According to Whom?\" by Coral Lorenzen in which she claims to \"correst some of the glaring errors\" in John Schuessler's article. In the past, I have simply ignored the prevarications made by Mrs. Lorenzen about MUFON and Walt Andrus published in the APRO Bulletin, knowing that they were prompted by a deep-seated jealousy due to the success of MUFON. In her latest tirade I could address each point individually where my name is mentioned, and provide written evidence of malicious equivocation. However, I am not going to stoop to that journalistic level. I definitely recommend that people read the article because Coral ' has clearly demonstrated her ability to ignore the facts by substituting pure fabrication, a distorted imagination of \"how she would like for it to be,\" and faulty recollections of past events. Knowledgeable UFO researchers and investigators will recognize her obvious distortions, however it is conceivable that newcomers might accept her libelous statements as true. I will not denigrate myself by addressing each and every one of her falsehoods and misrepresentations, because our Journal readers'are not receptive to replies to such obnoxious trivia. However, I am very reluctant to allow her to continue to slander the leaders of Ufology by \"turning the other cheek,\" and ignoring her unjust tirades that could destroy Ufology as we know it. â€¢    . â€¢ . ATTITUDE Since APRO's \"claim to fame\" is that it is the oldest UFO organization in the U.S.A. (1952), Coral is so egotistical as to believe there is no reason for any other UFO organization to exist. She fails to comprehend that being the oldest does not qualify the organization as \"the authority\" in the field of Ufology. Her continuous practice of slandering competent members who entered her so-called \"domain,\" alienated these people, whereby they resigned' and formed other UFO organizations such as NICAP, MUFON, GWS, CUFOS and SBI, just to name a few. The Lorenzens still do not understand that they cannot treat their members so shabbily in a volunteer organization. On the other hand, they resorted to insincere flattery to try to achieve their objectives, which is readily apparent to the recipients. I am sorry to say that the leaders of each of the above groups has been subjected to this same harassment over the past fifteen or more years, thus explaining the gradual demise of APRO. Coral's condescend- ing remarks in her article referring to Walt Andrus as a \"pest\" and \"nuisance,\" but not a \"threat\" is supposed to be cute. John Schuessler clearly identified the basic problem at APRO in his article â€” failure to develop leadership and potential management for the future. From 1979 through 1981, when the APRO office was being operated by people that Coral prefers to call \"hangersron,\" \"moles,\" etc., this obviously confirms their lack of management. In her article, Coral excuses her husband, Jim, the International Director of APRO, from managing since \"he was as usual working a full-time job.\" The majority of the members in UFO organizations all have full-time positions, but they delegate their time whereby they can perform their leadership responsibili- ties. If one was to believe her, Coral has indeed confirmed the subtitle of Mr. Schuessler's article â€” \"The (Sad?) State of Ufology.\" If \"Towards Truth\" is the motto and editorial philosophy of the APRO Bulletin, as depicted on the front page, Coral Lorenzen's latest article has set that obective back more years than she may realize. My only reason for responding to her disparaging remarks is to prevent Ufology, as we know it, from sinking to the levels that Coral has taken APRO as their spokeswoman. When some of us dedicate our lifetime to resolving this baffling mystery, it is discouraging to see one person, through internal dissension, attempt to destroy the scientific credibility that has finally been achieved.  n 11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"COMMENTS ON DRUFFEL'S MERCURY THEORY By Joe Kirk Thomas In the July/August, 1984, issue of the MUFON Journal, Ann Druffel commenced a two-part article entitled \"Mercury A Possible Clue to UFO Propulsion?\" Having read both,parts, I find myself unable to resist : making a few comments. Ann would seemingly have us believe that there is a growing body of evidence linking UFOs to the metal mercury. As I have followed the UFO literature rather closely for many years this came somewhat as a surprise. Nevertheless, I was certainly prepared to examine the anecdotal evidence 1 assumed Ann would muster linking the two. My contention is that no real evidence to that effect was presented. EVIDENCE The first evidence adduced, for example, was a sighting at Rio Vista, California, in May of 1964. The primary source of information appears to have been two newspaper accounts. Subsequent information turned up that a northern California investigator, not referenced, claimed that mercury was discovered missing from an oilfield over which the craft hovered. That's it? That's the evidence? Weak as it is, it is perhaps the strongest presented in the entire article. The second sighting offered as evidence was made by a 16 year old in 1973. The sighting itself did not involve mercury, but the percipient theorized that the UFO was powered by \"an incomplete MIT concept\" involving two mercury pools, rotating in opposite, directions, as part of nuclear fusion device. Ann admits not knowing if the case proved genuine, but that point is strangely irrelevant. Clearly, the percipient's theorizing that the UFO may have used mercury does not mean that it did! Much of the \"evidence\" culled up in support of a possible link between UFOs and mercury is in a similar vein. 12 Because sulphurous odors are sometimes reported with sightings, the synthesis, by McMasters .University chemists, of a mercury compound using sulphur dioxidej becomes significant. This is somewhat tantamount to saying salt smells of chlorine. It certainly does not indicate an association of mercury with UFOs. Nor does the rather common, use of mercury in electrical switching devices, discussed in Part II. In Part II, Ann showcases an alleged abduction case where the percipient purports to have been given an interstate ride. But the case is far from convincing, being filled with rather standard psuedo-scientific fare. Even the percipient's description ;of the \"mercury\" is erroneous. Having chased many a globule of mercury across laboratory tables and floors, I can assure the reader that it is anything but \"jelly-like.\" DUBIOUS REFERENCE Ann discusses briefly ancient Sanskrit writings alleged to describe wars between two antediluvian civilizations fought with nuclear-like weapons and flying vehicles called \"vimanas.\" Mercury was supposed to be an essential element in their propulsion systems. As I vaguely recalled hearing such tales before, I checked the reference given â€” Ivan T. Sanderson's Invisible Residents. And indeed, Appendix B of the book contains translated passages describing airships powered with iron engines that contained mercury. But where did Sanderson get his material? By kind permission of Desmond Leslie and his publishers. The name Desmond Leslie immediately raised a red flag of caution. Checking Sanderson's only reference on this matter, I found, as reference 261, \"Leslie, Desmond and Adamski, George, Flying Saucers Have Landed, etc.\" This is not an acceptable reference in legitimate ufology, and I think I know Ann well enough to say that she would not have used this material had she realized its source. In Part I, Ann points out that her background was in sociology, and . muses as to whether a non-technical person should theorize about possible modes of UFO propulsion. I personally have no objection as long as two provisos are met. The first is â€¢ simply that the investigator seek out professional expertise and opinion. In the sourthern California study group of which Ann is a part, there are three physicists and two engineers, three of whose training and experience includes plasma physics. They certainly would have been helpful in assessing the teenager's claim of \"an incomplete MIT concept,\" and perhaps prevented a number, of technical misconceptions that appeared in the article. Beyond the study group, there was the UCLA Fusion Laboratories, and the physics and engineering departments of many junior and 4-year colleges in the southern California area. Similar resources exist throughout the country for other ufologists. The second proviso is that some attempt be made to assure oneself a basic science education. Not all lay ufologists have a problem with basic science, but for those who do, I have, for several years now, recommended taking high school or college freshman level courses in physics, chemistry, and math. With the plethora of adult schools and junior colleges in most parts of the country, it really isn't a very tall order, and is a reasonable prerequisite for the rigors of ufology. Perhaps for the contributing subscriber, who is concerned primarily with keeping abreast of developments in ufology, such training is unnecessary. But I truly believe that basic science can be of significant value in shielding the investigator from the occasional ravages of pseudo-science and in assessing the anecdotal evidence. a"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Dear Editor, After discussing the matter of Joe Thomas' \"Comments on Druffel's Mercury, :Theory\" with Vince Uhjenkott, I believe a \"dialogue is in order. Contrary to what Joe wrote,;he did not read the. complete article to Vince. He shared a few ideas in it with him, and Vince agreed with some points, advising Joe to write his criticisms if he felt this was appropriate. I concur with Vince's opinion. No one who writes can expect to be free from criticism. I certainly don't. Anyone is free to think or write what they wish, except when their material itself holds inherent errors. Joe's \"Comments....\" has such errors. â€¢:... l.:In the title of his \"Comments...'' Joe \"refers to -\"Druffei's..Mercury Theory\" and said I was trying to make others-believe in a body of \"evidence\". The two-part article giving references to mercury nr UFO literature was very speculative; it was never meant to be a technical discussion of anything. It did not claim to be presenting \"evidence\". It never used the word \"theory\" or even \"hypothesis\". I am not qualified to write' a technical article dealing with UFO. propulsion and stated so plainly. Throughout, the main contention was that the various bits and pieces, gleaned from various sources, and all referring to .mercury, might contain possible clues which would strike a responsive chord in other researchers' minds. When the article was misinterpreted toy a few as an attempt at a technical discussion, I was surprised. 2. Patrick Thrush's theorizing was his own. Some portions of the case were included because there were references to mercury. Of course the facts of that report don't prove the UFO used mercury, but Thrush thought it did, 3. Likewise, the Rio Vista case was presented because of the reference to mercury being missed from an oil field over which the UFO had hovered. There was no claim that this was \"evidence\"; it was simply another reference to mercury in UFQ literature. The two newspaper accounts were, in the List of References to demonstrate that the case had been published. My knowledge of. the case, was more extensive than was contained in the newselips. - . , . 4. The M.C. case is not solidly .convincing. All the researchers who have worked on it know, that. But it was well-investigated and interesting enough to draw the- attention of professional scientists and engineers interested in UFO propulsion. Even though they couldn't prove her report, some felt the case might be based on reality. Until a case is proved fraudulent it should not be discarded. The .case contained a reference- to mercury,- so it was used.in. the article. . 5. The term \"jelly-like\" was M.Ci's, not mine. I report what witnesses ;say but don't try to judge their semantical accuracy. I have chased blobs of mercury, too, and am well acquainted ,-',. with its appearance and behavior. 6. I was aware 1 the reference to Desmond Leslie's writings could be traced to Flying Saucers Have Landed, but was not disturbed by this. 1 reject Adamski's, writings but nqt.Desrhond Leslie's. He is a respected English 'â€¢â€¢ .ufolqgist who has contributed much; qf value to the-field. Flying Saucers Haye v Landed is composed of two \"books\", -one. by Leslie, the other by Adamski. Leslie's ideas were entirely separate from Adamski's in that book; there were three short references to Adamski toward the end of Leslie's Book I, referring to him as an individual with a story to tell. Leslie made no in-depth suppositions about the value of Adamski's claims. There are, indeed, rumors I have heard to the effect that Leslie didn't even know his publisher was planning a joint book and was dismayed when he saw the final product, but I have no written reference to back this up. 7.. From the viewpoint of some, only science can provide the answers as to what UFOs are. Although the work of hard science is admirable, I don't agree fully with this view. We cannot say where the answer will be found. Science, in its present state of knowledge, seems inadequate to the full task. Science has its limits; its knowledge is incomplete. Many researchers extend their search beyond a narrow, physical universe, and others do not. This is the basic con- flict existing among individuals in the UFO field today! We would all benefit from a more open-minded tolerance of each other's ideas and contributions. 8. Regarding Joe's contention that researchers must study physics, chemistry and math, I did study these subjects long ago in high school and have a slight acquaintance with some aspects of these. I could just as well insist that Joe study transpersonal psychology and the art of interviewing because lack of knowledge of these holds him back from an adequate understanding of UFO witnesses. But I will not do that; who can judge what any researcher needs to do effective work in this field? 9. All elements in the mercury article . were presented adequately qualified. There was no intention to present it as a technical article. Perhaps a disclaimer at the beginning shoujd have been added to prevent anyone from mistaking my intentions. Air good wishes Ann Druffel Dear Editor, I have today received from Ann a copy of her,' letter in response to \"Comments on Druffel's Mercury Theory\". Ann's remarks about communica- tion between Vince Uhlenkott and myself about the article are less than accurate. I called Vince on either Saturday or Sunday afternoon (September 29 or 30) and discussed with him my concerns about writing the article. At that time, I had composed about 1 and 1/2 handwritten pages, which I read to him. Vince agreed with both the content and the style, and felt that there'was nothing inappropriate about the article so long,as I continued in the same vein. I completed the article during my lunch hour Monday, and that evening called Vince just as he was (confinueo 1 on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Letters To The Editor, Continued starting a BBQ. I read the complete article to Vince, whose impression was favorable. That article was exactly the article submitted to MUFON two days later except for one paragraph. Later that evening, I discovered the source of the Sanskrit tales to be Desmond Leslie. I decided to delete a paragraph detailing some of Ann's technical misconceptions and insert a paragraph discussing the alleged ancient references. I gave the written manuscript so modified to a typist the next day, and I believe I mailed the proofed manuscript to MUFON Wednesday. Ann has seized upon the fact that one paragraph in the article submitted to MUFON differed from the version I read to Vince, perhaps as evidence of dishonesty or deceit on my part. That simply is not the case. It was an honest error, and 1 apologize for it. Ann is simply grasping for straws, and in point of fact, Vince did concur with the contents of the article (except for the one paragraph that obviously did not exist at the time I spoke with him) and thought it was well written. May I suggest that if you really have any questions on this matter, you discuss them with Vince directly. Insofar as Ann's response is concerned, I would point out that it is in violation of the 50% Rule as explained in the Journal.} do not know the length of Ann's two-part series, but my response to that article was 846 words long. Under the 50% rule, Ann is entitled to 423 words. Her response to \"Comments...\" is 759 words. The editor, of course, can wave such restrictions, and though I would prefer a reduction, in conformity with journal policy, I do not insist upon it. Otherwise, I have no objections to Ann's response. Joe Kirk Thomas MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN, TX 78155 Brenda Butler Dot Street & Jenny Randies A cosmic conspiracy Sometime towards the end of December 1980 a quiet clearing In Rendlesham Forest, Eastern England, was the unsuspecting host to a major event which was so dramatic that Its consequences are difficult to grasp. On that night, around the midnight hour, something came out of the sky and crashed into that Suffolk pine forest. What that something was, and the three-year fight to break the conspiracy, Is the subject of this spellbinding story. And throughout the Investigators have met the British and American Governments head on, who in turn have endeavoured to withhold the facts and the truth. For the researches strongly suggest something truly incredible. The thing from the sky which crashed into the forest may well have been a UFO. The evidence is undeniable and supported by official confirmation horn both the Pentagon .and the British Ministry of Defence. It is impossible to confront this evidence and conclude that these events did not take place. Sky Crash la backed up by documen- tation and testament and demon- strates without quibble that there was an official cover-up from the moment it happened. Sky Crash has all the ingredients of a spy thriller, fear spiced with mystery. Intrigue and a devastating theory.

Mr. Schuessler was one of the founding members of MUFON in 1969. *â€¢*â€¢* On July 7, 1984, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, John Timmerman, Richard H. Hall, John F. Schuessler and Walt Andrus met in San Antonio to discuss the potential future of the North American UFO Federation (NAUFOF) as it concerned CUFOS, MUFON, and the Fund for UFO Research. The Board of Directors of CUFOS had already made a decision not to support NAUFOF and Dr. J. Allen Hynek resigned from the NAUFOF Board. With the resignation of Dr. Richard F. Haines as Director in September, 1984, the future looked very bleak considering who would automatically ascend to the directorship. MUFON, SKYNET and the Fund for UFO Research were the only organizations who paid membership dues in 1983- 84. After due consideration, MUFON has elected not to provide financial support to the NAUFOF for 1984-85, since it has deteriorated to an association of UFO splinter groups that are not interested in cooperation except on their terms. Such an organization is not qualified to represent the North American Continent in international UFO circles, therefore Richard H. Hall and Walt Andrus proposed that the NAUFOF be dissolved through a vote of the Board of Directors. Insufficient votes were cast for the dissolution of the Federation. MUFON and CUFOS are already member organizations of the International Committee for UFO Research (ICUR), .therefore our financial and research activities will be directed to this prestigious international body. Michael Sinclair, International Coordinator, has been MUFON's representative to ICUR and has attended all board meetings. *** With the continued growth of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, a new Illinois MUFON group has been organized under the leadership of Karen Tellor, State Section Director for Madison County and the support of William G. Willman, State Section Director for St. Clair and Monroe Counties. Known as Quad County MUFON, they meet the second Tuesday of each month at Rascals Restaurant, Highway 157 and Mall Road, in Collinsville, Illinois, at 6:30 PM for dinner and followed by their meeting at 7:30 PM. The public is invited. Additional information may be obtained from Ms. Tellor at (618) 345-7460. MUFON encourages the formation of such investigative teams as Karen Tellor has organized. The UFOSG of St. Louis is to be commended for helping establish this new group across the Mississippi River. On September 8th, John Rappolo was elected President of the UFOSG for the 1984- 85 year. During a vacation trip to Honolulu and the island of Oahu, Jeanne and Walt Andrus arranged to meet with MUFON members in the islands on October 5th. We were the dinner guests of Dr. David W. Swift, his wife Lois and daughter Kathy. Mr. and Mrs. David Crockett joined us for dessert. (Mr. Crockett is best known for his motion picture of a UFO filmed from an airfreighter between the North and : South Islands of New Zealand in 1978.) We visited by telephone with Don E. Avery, Ph.D. in Kaneohe and John Napier in Kihoi. Michael Brein, State Director for Hawaii, was with his father in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who was undergoing heart surgery, therefore we missed visiting with Michael as well as Paul McCarthy, former Assistant State Director and Kalani Hanohano (David Jacobson) former State Director for Washington. *** Utilizing the donation from MUFON of San Antonio, the Mutual UFO Network purchased a JVC model HR-D22OU VHS video cassette recorder for use in public relation events and analysis of UFO documentaries and video films in our library. May we express our appreciation to Tom Deuley and the Symposium committee who made this possible. Gifts were also received during October from Dr. Gary Levine in Kingston, New York and Mrs. Louise Deadman of Pine Bluff, Arkansas. MUFON will provide a copy of our I.R.S. Tax Exempt Status to all donors for their 1984 Federal Income Tax returns. These gifts help make it possible for us to purchase capital equipment items so as to expand our research capabilities. Nominations for candidates for the Central Regional Director election to the MUFON Board of Directors must be submitted in writing before April 15, 1985. Wherever this has not been done, State Directors are requested to select and appoint Assistant State Directors and State Public Relations Directors to complete their state organizations. The MUFON Board of Directors and the Journal Staff would like to take this opportunity to extend a very Merry Christmas and Holiday Greetings to our members throughout the world for their loyalty and volunteer dedication to resolving the UFO phenomenon. Your continued interest, enthusiasm, and talent are essential if we are to solve the greatest scientific mystery of our time. We can all be proud of the accomplishments of the Mutual UFO Network in our fifteen years of operation. A vote of thanks and gratitude to each of you for helping to establish MUFON as the leading UFO membership organization in the world today. May lovely, happy times decorate your holiday season. May wanp, special memories brighter? your new year. May the wonder of Christmas be with you forever. 19"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus The UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis is hosting the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium at the Chase Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri, on June 28,29, and 30, 1985.

John Schroeder, State Section Director, will be the Master of Ceremonies. *** Congratulations to Shirely C. Fox, State Section Director and Everette R. Walter, Ph.D., Consultant in Electrical Engineering for their full page spread in the Fort Myers (Florida) News-Press with photographs of each. George D. Fawcett, Assistant State Director for North Carolina, had UFO window displays set up in two storefronts in Lincolnton, North Carolina, during their recent Apple Festival. A fine article by Beth Burrell, Staff Reporter for the Gasronia Gazette (North Carolina) with a picture of George and one of his displays was recently published. Ms. Burrell not only interviewed Mr. Fawcett for her story, but conducted telephone interviews with Captain Miles Wiley, U.S.A.F. in Washington, D.C., and with your Director in Seguin, Texas. Both articles will probably be published in the UFO Newsclipping Service by Lucius Parish. This is the type of favorable UFO publicity that is vitally needed for public education so as to remind the populace that the UFO enigma still represents one of the most significant scientific problems facing the governments of this planet. Since a person must be eighteen years of age to be a Field Investigator or Trainee in MUFON, Shirley C. Fox has proposed and started an associate group of talented teenagers, who will be known as Junior Investigators. Many of our present' officers in MUFON became interested in the UFO phenomenon while in Junior and Senior High School, therefore we heartily endorse Shirley's proposal. *** The syndicated national TV program, PM Magazine, featuring a segment about the Mutual UFO Network that was aired on October 18, 1984, produced\"very positive responses from people from coast-to-coast in reply to our telephone number shown on the TV screen for viewers. A partial list of the telephone calls received in the MUFON office came from the following cities: Costa Mesa, Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco (California); Azle, Garland, and Ft. Worth (Texas); Salt Lake City (Utah); Bush, (Louisiana); Louisville, Crestwood, and Shepardsville (Kentucky); Albuquer- que and Deming (New Mexico); Oakville, Meriden, and West Hartford (Connecticut); East Waterford and Lancaster (Pennsylvania); New York City, South Glen Falls, Brooklyn, Albany, Monsey, and North Babylon (New York); Fredericksburg (Virginia); St. Charles (Missouri); Kula, (Hawaii); Emerson (New Jersey); Longwood and Avon Park (Florida); and Oakburo (North Carolina). Many of these people shared UFO experiences and some were referred to local MUFON officers so personal interviews could be conducted. Several months ago Norman S. Bean, State Director for Florida, advised your International Director that he was contemplating resigning his position because of his inability to travel and advancing age. At that time Donald M. Ware agreed to be the Assistant State Director. On October 21st, Mr. Ware met with Mr. Bean in Miami, to coordinate plans for the future of MUFON in Florida and the transition in leadership. Donald M. Ware has now been appointed as the State Director for Florida succeeding Mr. Bean who has held that position for nearly four years, originally joining MUFON in 1974. Mr. Ware is a retired U.S.A.F. Lt. Colonel with a Masters Degree in Nuclear Engineering, a fighter pilot and a graduate of the Air War College. Don attended the last two MUFON UFO Symposia, since retiring from the U.S.A.F. and returning to live in Ft. Walton Beach, Florida. He has plans to revitalize our investigative and research team in Florida through correspond- ence. Michael A. Chamblee, an architect in Llano, Texas has been appointed the State Section Director for Llano County. After two UFO sightings by Mr. Chamblee and his family, he has kept his camera immediately available for future opportunities. Michael and two of his sons attended the MUFON Symposium in San Antonio. He has a B.A. in architecture and is also a builder. After serving as the Project Manager for Space Shuttle Flight Operations, John F. Schuessler was recently promoted to the position of Director for Engineering for the McDonnell Douglas Technical Services Company, Inc., Houston Operations.
