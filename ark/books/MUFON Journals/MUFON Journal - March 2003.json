Update on Ramey message O ne aspect of the Roswell case that continues to interest ufologists is the famous \"message\" or \"memo\" which Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey is holding in his hand in the photo taken by J. Bond Johnson on July 8, 1947. The setting was a press conference called by the military to explain the \"solution\" to the pre- viously-announced recovery of a \"disk\" by the Army. With Gen. Ramey is Col. Thomas J. DuBose, as well as debris described as a Rawin Target and weather balloon. In 1991, a greatly-enlarged copy of the message por- tion of the photograph was sent by researcher Don Schmitt to Dr. Richard Haines, a former NASA research scientist, to see if Dr. Haines could read any of the mes- sage. Despite the use of a microscope Dr. Haines said he could see that the message contained words, but that he could not determine many individual letters. In 1994 the Air Force reportedly had \"a national labo- ratory\" look at the memo. Supposedly the unnamed lab could not decipher the message. There the matter rested until Johnson launched his own investigation in 1998, putting together a team, including Ron Regehr, which would use more modern methods of deciphering the message. The team deciphered the mes- sage as follows: AS THE... 4 HRS THE VICTIMS OF THE... AT FORT WORTH, TEX... THE \"CRASH\" STORY... FOR 0984 ACKNOWLEDGES... EMERGENCY POWERS ARE NEEDED SITE TWO SW OF MAGDALENA, NMEX... SAFE TALK... FOR MEANING OF STORY AND MISSION... WEATHER BALLOONS SENT ON THE... AND LAND... rOVER CREWS... [SIGNED]... TEMPLE. While much of the message was unclear, ufologists were intrigued with certain words which the team came up with, especially \"victims,\" \"Ft. Worth, Tex,\" \"crash,\" \"emergency powers are needed,\" \"Magdalena, New Mexico,\" and \"weather balloons,\" which seemed to clearly tie the message to the July, 1947, Roswell incident which the military claimed was nothing more than balloons and instrumentation carried by those balloons. This report encouraged other researchers to become involved. Neil Morris, a technician at the University of Manchester in the UK, and part of Johnson's Roswell Photo Interpretation Team (RPIT), organized the mes- sage line by line and used capital letters to represent the letters of the message of which he was sure, lower case letters to represent his best guess at some letters, an as- terisk to indicate a letter he could not decipher, and a dash where there was something present that seemed impossible to decipher. Morris' interpretation was for the most part different While this enlargement of the message held in the hand of Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey offers few clues at this magnificaion level, researchers have utilized spe- cial computer software to decipher key information. from that of the first group of Johnson researchers, al- though the key word \"victims\" was present, as was \"Fort Worth, Texas.\" He was also perhaps the first person to propose that \"victims\" was part of the phrase \"victims of the wreck.\" Other researchers have since gotten involved, includ- ing David Rudiak, Tom Carey (working with Schmitt), and Don Burleson, who has done several articles about the message for the MUFON UFO Journal. Initially Carey worked partly in conjunction with Burleson but later with Rudiak. Thus there was some sharing of work, though generally the researchers worked mostly independently. Rudiak worked primarily from high-resolution scans of 20X print enlargements. He claims to have deciphered almost the entire message, including the address header, which he says shows the message being addressed to 1 General \"Vandenberg\" at the Pentagon. There are also many differences from the initial RPIT group. For example, he was the first to pick out the word \"disc\" where RPIT initially claimed to see the word \"crash.\" In place of \"Magdalena\" he has the word \"Roswell.\" In place of the mystery man \"Temple\" sign- ing the message, he has \"Ramey.\" Rudiak has been critical of RPIT and others for not adhering to proper word letter counts, contending that words like \"Magdalena\" and \"crash\" are too long for the actual words. He has also been critical of others for not coming up with coherent and sensible interpretations that read like proper grammatical English. Nonetheless, there were important points of agreement with RPIT, particularly on the key word \"victims,\" and others like \"Fort Worth, Tex.\", \"weather balloons,\" \"mean- ing of story,\" and \"land ... crews.\" Another important phrase of agreement with others was \"the victims of the wreck you forwarded to the ?????? at Fort Worth, Tex.\" Burleson, who has also spent a great deal of time work- ing on the message, utilized special computer image en- hancement software, including LUCIS, and came up with new interpretations-but again \"victims\" (\"victims of the (Continued on page 5) March 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Interpretations of Ramey message by various researchers Capital letters are those that the interpreter believes to be accurate.

He also found such key words as \"Fort Worth, Tex,\" \"disk,\" \"weather bal- loons,\" \"meaning of story,\" and \"crews,\" which nearly all researchers now agree on. (Another key word was \"op- eration,\" which Rudiak also found, but in a different loca- tion on the same line, as part of the phrase \"near opera- tion at the ranch.\" In place of Burleson's \"operation,\" Rudiak believes it instead reads either \"at location\" or \"in addition.\") Interestingly, Burleson also found \"Los Alamos\" and \"Carlsbad, NMex,\" which other researchers have not found. In discussing \"Carlsbad,\" he noted that he was as surprised as anyone, since it seemed to have no relevance to the Roswell incident, but was the only interpretation that made sense, given the letters, spacing, length of words, and context. In contrast, Rudiak has strongly objected to \"Carlsbad\" for the same basic reason he objected to RPIT's \"Magdalena,\" noting that \"Carlsbad\" is one letter too long for the actual word, whereas \"Roswell\" is not. Further, the fact that \"Carlsbad\" has no known relevance to Roswell he considers to be additional negative against Burleson's interpretation. Veteran researcher Stan Friedman, who first opened the Roswell inquiry after a conversation with Maj. Jesse Marcel, Sr., became interested in the interpretation of the message, and had a high resolution scan made of the origi- nal negative of the Johnson photo. The scan was sent to Rob Belyea of ProLab to exam- ine, who said he could not see \"Magdalena\" in the text, but indicated he could not spend the time necessary to fully examine the scan (which is available from Friedman on a special CD). The Houran study The most recent research on the document is a psy- chological study by Jim Houran, a psychologist at South- ern Illinois University, who attempted to \"estimate the de- March 2003 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"gree of bias that suggestion and expectation have played in previous interpretations.\" Houran suggested that \"such findings would be helpful for determining whether more refined analyses of the memo are needed, as well as what type of research de- sign for deciphering the memo would promote maximum reliability, objectivity, and meaningfulness.\" Houran and two research assistants recruited 176 people-93 men and 83 women-for the study, dividing them into three roughly equal groups. Group 1 was made up of 59 individuals who were asked to \"carefully study and try to read the contents of a photograph of a military memo that could contain infor- mation about the crash, retrieval, and subsequent cover- up of an extraterrestrial craft near Roswell, New Mexico, in July of 1947.\" Group 2 was made up of 58 individuals who were asked to \"carefully study and try to read the contents of a photograph of a military memo that could contain infor- mation about atomic testing.\" Group 3 was made up of 59 individuals who were asked to \"carefully study and try to read the contents of a photograph of a document.\" This group was given no clues about what the document might contain. The study, which was reported by both Houran and Kevin Randle, indicates that \"a person's age and knowl- edge (belief, alleged experience, and exposure to UFO information) significantly influenced the number of words deciphered, irrespective of the suggestion condition. \"The suggestion condition also affected the number of words deciphered,\" says the authors. \"Analysis revealed that subjects in the Pro-Roswell and Atomic Bomb Sug- gestion conditions deciphered a similar number of words in the document, and both of these conditions elicited sig- nificantly more words than in the blind control condition.\" Participants in Group 1 (Roswell), who spent an aver- age of 20 minutes on the document, \"tended to interpret some words in accordance with earlier interpretations of the same words in the same positions by ufologists,\" Houran and Randle reported. This included \"remains,\" \"weather balloons,\" and \"land.\" Group 2 participants (atomic bomb) spent an average of 16 minutes trying to decipher the document, finding words such as \"flash,\" \"glasses,\" and \"atomic.\" Group 3 participants (no subject matter) spent an av- erage of 14 minutes on the document. \"Only a few inter- pretations were noted,\" reports Houran, \"and the content of these efforts did not strongly reflect any particular sce- nario.\" Houran and Randle note that \"even without sophisti- cated analytic software, the subjects across all three con- ditions found parts of the document legible. Moreover, despite the statistically significant effects of cognitive style and suggestion, subjects across the three groups did show consensus on several words that previous investigators also agreed upon: 'Fort Worth TX' (n = 52), 'story' (n = 61), and 'weather balloons' (n = 27). \"Another word of relative agreement, 'land' (n = 47), was noticed by the two primary suggestion conditions, in which people were perhaps more motivated or discrimi- nating in their interpretations than in the blind condition. Finally, subjects across all suggestion conditions perceived punctuation marks within the document. Houran and Randle reported that \"the surprisingly high agreement between our subjects and previous investiga- tors on some words in certain locations in the Ramey document suggests that some of it is indeed legible, even without computer enhancement. However, the meaning or context of those specified words remains ambiguous because the degree of interpretation of the document is strongly influenced by suggestion effects and a person's cognitive style. Ufologists, therefore, are probably among the least effective people to be trying to decipher the docu- ment.\" Houran and Randle suggest that \"it seems reasonable to pursue research on the memo only if certain method- ological criteria are set. We offer some thoughts about such a protocol, based on discussions with the Illinois State Archives and David Rudiak, a well-known investigator of the document.\" (Rudiak, however, does not agree with the proposed methodological criteria, as we shall see later.) \"First,\" say Houran and Randle, \"to be methodologi- cally consistent we recommend that standardized com- puter enhancement be used on the best raw data that we have (Stanton Friedman's CD of scans of the negatives), using comparable software programs. Analysis should be conducted by at least three independent and blind labora- tories that specialize in the area of reading and transcrib- ing archival documents. \"With this triangulation approach, we can reasonably estimate the inter-rater reliability (and hence validity) of the resulting interpretations (i.e., do the laboratories show statistically significant agreement on specific words in precise locations in the text). Houran notes that \"it is possible at this point to calcu- late an intra-class correlation on the solutions published thus far, but we feel this would be inappropriate, since the majority of the previous investigators did not follow a stan- dardized analytic protocol, and were not blind to the con- text and thus possible content of the document. \"Second, we must be cautious in interpreting any sta- tistically significant outcomes of a blind, triangulation study. Prior to having independent laboratories decipher the message, we might also request them to perform prelimi- nary analyses on the structure of the document. This might reveal some insights into what kind of document it is, even if the same laboratories cannot decipher the content of the document. David Rudiak proposed some lucid guide- lines in this respect: \"A. Determine the letter spacing and position through alignment of columns of clearly visible text and extrapo- lating to poorly visible letter positions. \"B. Determine length of words, assuming no typographi- cal errors and misspellings, and adhere to those word counts. \"C. Assuming initially that the message is written in proper English instead of some type of cryptic military (or other) shorthand or jargon, the sentences should obey rules of English grammar and obey rules of syntax and seman- tics. In short, the message should make sense and be Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal March 2003"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"consistent in content instead of sounding disjointed. Al- though, if the memo is, in fact, a military message, then assumptions about the military shorthand and jargon could complicate and possibly invalidate the conclusions being drawn.\" Houran concludes, \"What the present and previous studies have demonstrated is that parts of the document are readable and perhaps even ultimately interpretable. What is needed at this stage is outside corroboration that can only come from triangulated, blind analyses from well- qualified laboratories and a set of stringent guidelines to evaluate any of their positive findings....It seems that a call for funding of such a large-scale investigation of the document is justified. \"While such a study would admittedly be expensive, it would have a long-lasting effect on the Roswell case from this point on, and it might also have a healing effect for the field.\" Another well-known UFO researcher, Richard Hall, commented, \"Clearly, something far more unusual than a Mogul balloon, and certainly far beyond a standard weather balloon, crashed near Roswell.\" But he also sug- gested that different interpretations of the Ramey mes- sage \"seem substantial.\" He comments that \"the few key words\" which most researchers agree on \"are interesting, but not conclu- sive. I am not aware that there is much agreement about the alleged word 'wreck.' Whatever happened to peer review?\" As noted, Rudiak does not agree with the approach suggested by Houran and Randle, and he questions the \"peer review\" suggested by Hall. He has also pointed out that some of Hall's beliefs are clearly in error, such as lack of agreement about the word \"wreck,\" noting that \"wreck\" was the consensus work of 4 out of 6 re- searchers mentioned in the Houran and Randle article. (RPIT came up with no word and the 6th person came up with \"material,\" which was 3 letters too long and eas- ily discounted.) Further, Rudiak said that what Hall terms \"substantial differences\" are not that significant when one considers that there were consensus readings on critical words like \"weather balloons,\" \"the victims,\" and \"the 'disc',\" and phrases like \"the victims of the wreck you forwarded to ...Fort Worth.\" More of Rudiak's reactions are presented in the following article.

Box 369, Morrison, CO 80465-0369 Houran/Randle study missing key elements By David Rudiak The psychological study by James Houran, as reported by him and Kevin Randle in the Journal of Scientific Exploration (JSE), was flawed in many ways. Images of the \"Ramey message\" were not of optimum resolution nor enhanced beforehand for readability. Sub- jects were thus double-tasked with both trying to read the document and doing their own enhancements. Only 17 minutes average was spent per participant (about 15 sec- onds per word), totally inadequate to the task, and also suggesting little motivation on the part of most. And two- thirds were hindered in their readings by not knowing the proper context. However, the most serious problem was that there was no numerical data supporting the primary conclusion of the researchers. Houran and Randle stated they \"ex- pected\" that different contextual situations \"would elicit significant differences in the participants' interpretations.\" They also claimed the results \"supported our expectations.\" But the critical data was missing from their summary table. Remarkably, they then sheepishly admitted that a ref- eree had asked for the data, but that a research assistant had thrown it out. (Randle on the UFO Updates Internet discussion list added that these were his personal score sheets. It is hard to understand why a research assistant would throw out a senior investigator's personal data.) This begs the question of how one can arrive at a con- clusion without the data and then write a paper about it. It is also remarkable that the paper would then be allowed through peer review. The numbers that were provided in the paper also do not support the conclusion. E.g., the two groups that were given context deciphered an average of fewer than 5 words per person. This does not suggest a lot of guessing based on \"wishful thinking\" going on. Further, only 10 anecdotal examples of context-sensi- tive or \"exclusive\" words were given in these two groups out of some 550 total deciphered words. Four of these words (\"remains,\" \"fundamental,\" \"meaning,\" and \"morn- ing\") had no obvious contextual connection to either the \"Roswell\" context (misleadingly labeled the \"Pro-UFO Condition\") or alternate \"atomic bomb\" context. E.g., the word \"meaning,\" one of the so-called words \"exclu- sive\" to the atomic testing context, was also a consensus word of various Roswell researchers (in the phrase \"mean- ing of story\"). There were also no numbers to tell us how many times these words were seen, since this was part of the trashed data. Thus it could be as few as 6 context-sensitive words out of 550, or slightly more than 1% of all words. Even generously assuming that several people came up with each of these words, we seem to be dealing with only a few percent maximum of all words, which hardly qualifies March 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"as a significant \"priming\" effect at all. Houran and Randle did discuss that a few words were common to all three of their experimental situations; therefore, some words were more readable than others and likely there. These were \"Fort Worth, Tex,\" \"weather balloons,\" \"land,\" and \"story,\" also seen by the initial Ramey memo researchers. However, totally missing from the discussion was a very obvious effect that was supported by the surviving numerical data. Readings of these \"common\" words were greatly enhanced in the group knowing the correct Roswell context. The Roswell group read these words two and a half times more often than the group given the misleading \"atomic bomb\" context (196 vs. 78 words), and over four times more frequently than the control group (196 vs. 42 words). Thus their data supported what many other studies in the perceptual literature have shown for a long time- namely the vital role that proper context plays in correctly interpreting ambiguous data. This was a very robust ef- fect and definitely merited discussion, but there was none. This also completely undercut their arguments, both in the paper and on the UFO Updates discussion list, that proper context and knowledge of the subject matter were \"confounding\" and decreased reliability. Exactly the op- posite was true. It likewise undercut their argument that the only valid way to test the presence of words in the message was to turn over readings to independent analysts who were kept completely ignorant of all circumstances surrounding the message. Objections were also raised by Houran and Randle to interpretations of the Ramey letter by various research- ers. They suggested there was almost no agreement among researchers as to the wording of the document, and multiple times over several pages of discussion claimed the readings amount to little more than researcher bias, wishful thinking, or seeing \"faces in the clouds.\" I too have criticisms of the methodologies of other re- searchers, such as failing to adhere to correct word letter counts or making their readings sensible. However, it is misleading to limit discussions only to differences, and not note the important agreements on key words amongst various researchers. Houran and Randle did include a useful table compar- ing interpretations of different researchers. If one both- ers to study this table, it turns out there was consensus on about a third of the 70 or so words out in the open (i.e., not obscured by obstructions, page tilt, and/or in shadow). Literally everybody agrees that the words \"weather balloons\" are present in the memo. This is important be- cause it establishes that the message is about Roswell in some way, despite early objections by naysayers like Philip Klass, and also Kevin Randle. How does one know the message is about Roswell and not something else? Because the odds of Gen. Ramey simultaneously dealing with an unrelated message con- cerning \"weather balloons\" is about zero, given the his- torical context. Another key word that most people agree on is \"vic- tims,\" in the phrase (which most people also agree on) \"the victims of the wreck you forwarded to the ?????? at Fort Worth, Tex.\" That's the key to the entire message. If there were \"victims,\" then this was no balloon wreck, and the testimony concerning body recovery at Roswell is now documented. Anybody who thinks the word \"victims\" isn't there should check out the following graphic: http:// www.roswellproof.conWictim_compare.html The other key word is \"disc\" (with quotes around it) in the sentence immediately following (also present for com- parison in the above link — see also http:// www.roswellproof.com/critical_phrases.html ). Most people agree that word is there as well. These words, in addition to \"weather balloons,\" only reinforce that this message must be dealing with the concurrent Roswell situation in some way. (Note: The inflammatory press release from the Roswell base that a \"flying disk\" had been recovered had first gone out over the news wire only about two hours before the photo in Fort Worth was taken.) Thus we have a military telegram about Roswell (\"weather balloons\") mentioning \"the victims\" and an object called \"the 'disc,'\" and most people who have taken the time to actually study what is there agree on this, despite disagreements elsewhere. In other words, there is already peer group verification of critical parts of this message. (Other issues concerning \"peer review\" will also be discussed below.) Despite the obvious, Randle and Houran continue to dispute that this message is about Roswell. E.g., \"The message could be about almost anything;\" \"There is cur- rently no consensus on either the source or content of the message;\" \"...it is not clear under what context the docu- ment was written.\" Even after conceding that words like \"weather bal- loons\" are there, they come to the remarkably absurd conclusion that such words \"could be interpreted as hav- ing nothing to do with the case.\" To arrive at that conclusion, one would have to assume that Gen. Ramey routinely handled messages concerning \"weathers balloons,\" and by some remarkable coincidence just happened to be holding such an \"unrelated\" message while simultaneously having his picture taken with a weather balloon during his attempt to debunk the reported \"flying disk\" find at Roswell. Randle also dusts off another of his old objections to the message (also made by Klass), claiming Ramey never would have been holding a message of any import in his hand, especially while having his picture taken: \"...it seems strange that Ramey, a general officer who had handled classified material long before this event, would be so cavalier in handling this message. ...he would have given it to his aide, he would have set it in his desk drawer, or would have had it locked in the same by his secretary. That is the proper way to handle classified material, and Ramey would not have likely made such an elementary mistake, especially with a camera and a re- porter in his office.\" This is a classic example of circular reasoning, akin to the Air Force in their 1994 Roswell report. There was no PageS MUFON UFO Journal March 2003"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"need to consider the reports of alien bodies, they wrote, because the crash was of a Mogul balloon, which had \"no 'alien' passengers therein.\" Here Randle was saying the message couldn't be important, because Ramey wouldn't be holding an important message. The fact of the matter remains that Ramey was hold- ing the message, whether he should have been holding it or not. No allowances seem to be made for other possi- bilities, such as Ramey might still have been dealing with the message (such as planning his next move) when the photographer arrived for Ramey's weather balloon photo. Perhaps Ramey's display of the message was a momen- tary lapse on his part. E.g., in three of four photographs taken that day showing Ramey holding the message, the message side was turned away from the camera. In a similar vein, Randle also tries to raise the specter of the message being a typewritten draft instead of an actual telex. \"If that is the case, then there is no reason for it to be typed in all capital letters and the interpreta- tions are suddenly changed.\" Again, this argument is easily dismissed by simply ex- amining the message closely, such as the unanimously agreed-upon, clearer words like \"FORT WORTH, TEX\" and \"WEATHER BALLOONS,\" which are obviously in all-caps. Oddly, earlier Randle had noted that nearly ev- eryone agreed that the message was a teletype and in all capital letters. Why later confuse the issue when there was no evidence whatsoever to support the idea of the letter being typewritten? About the only side-show objection missing in this pa- per was whether the message could have been written in Hungarian. I have read literally hundreds of scientific papers, but I can honestly say I have never read one where obviously critical data and discussions were omitted while a large percentage of the paper was devoted to obviously irrelevant, illogical, and/or fallacious arguments. Again the JSE peer review process failed badly in editing out such material and keeping the paper on point. Civilian or military? Another thoroughly frivolous argument advanced by Randle was that the message was really a civilian rather than a military message, and therefore again of no im- port. Randle's primary argument was that the message lacked \"typical\" military telex word punctuation, namely PD for a period, and CMA for a comma. Previously Randle had argued that because this was a military message and nobody was seeing PD or CMA in the message, they had to be reading it wrong. Now he was flipping the argument on its head. He finally conceded the punctuation was indeed nor- mal, but because of this, \"it would seem that we are not dealing with a military memo. \" (Emphasis his) To this was added, \"We suggest ...that we make no assumptions about the context or content of this document...\" In other words, Randle and Houran were deliberately trying to strip the document not only of its obvious Roswell con- text, but of its military context as well. What's wrong with this argument? First and foremost, it assumes that literally all military telexes used word ab- breviations for punctuation. This is demonstrably false, with innumerable counterexamples. E.g., in a recent UFO Updates debate with Randle, I mentioned going through the Appendices of Timothy Good's \"Above Top Secret.\" I found six military telexes, dated 1954 to 1980, using standard punctuation, and only one from 1953 that used the word abbreviations. Re- searcher Brad Sparks also e-mailed me with the follow- ing pertinent information: \"Let me point out something that may help: The CMA and PD spelled out words for punctuation were used for RADIO voice and radiotelegraph Morse Code messages where it was thought the chances of mishearing the punc- tuation was too great. It was generally NOT used for telexes.\" Another of Randle's arguments is that the message, if it were military and classified, should definitely have se- curity stamps at the top and bottom of the sheet. \"If those markings are not present, it means that the docu- ment is not classified, and therefore, is not very impor- tant...\" The expected presence of classification markings is a valid point, and was originally raised by Randle in e-mail to me about 2-3 years ago. What it overlooks is that such stamps are often partial, faint, and indistinct, even in clear, flat photostatic copies of declassified documents. Readability of such stamps in the grainy, shadowy, and unflat Ramey message is inherently going to be much more difficult. E.g., the top half of the paper is sharply turned away from the camera and in shadow. The top left of the sheet is actually completely hidden from the camera by paper curvature. Even if a security stamp was located there, it would be invisible. There are also clearly stamps of some kind at the top/ right center of the page (Randle is well aware of this, since we discussed them in e-mail). However, I do not believe that these are security stamps. One I am fairly sure reads \"ARMY CABLE.\" (The other may read \"BELL CBL\" or possibly \"BELL TEL.\") Whatever, they do indicate the presence of some stamps on the page and thus are suggestive of the possible presence of others. Prompted by Randle's e-mail remarks, I turned my at- tention away from the message proper and closely exam- ined the lower part of the page. There I do believe is a faint \"SECRET\" or \"TOP SECRET\" stamp. The \"S,\" \"C,\" \"R,\" and \"T\" in \"SECRET\" can be made out with a little effort; the other letters are much less distinct. (A graphic showing this can be found at the following link: http://www.roswellproof.com/Top_Secret.html) It is unlikely that everyone will accept the presence of this faint security stamp, but I believe a reasonable case can be made for it being there. On the other hand, Randle has the unenviable task of trying to prove a negative, that there are no security stamps to be found anywhere. It is not possible to prove the absence of the expected secu- rity marking at the corresponding top-left part of the page because this portion is hidden from the camera, as al- ready mentioned above. The other argument for civilian origins that Randle ad- vanced even he doesn't take very seriously. These were claims of the photographer, James 6ond Johnson, that he March 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"might have handed Ramey an AP teletype that he brought with him from his newspaper. Johnson has since retracted this statement, saying he was merely speculating. And as Randle notes (and knows better than anyone) Johnson has had numerous changes and elaborations of his story since Randle's original inter- views with him in 1989. However, let's ignore the various misstatements and corrections by Johnson over the years and concentrate on the hypothesis that this was actually a civilian news document. Portions of these wire service bulletins ended up as wire service stories in various papers, with the editors doing some \"cut and paste\" jobs, but retaining most of the original wording. We can see this in the early United Press stories when we compare them with the originals retained by Roswell radio announcer Frank Joyce. And we have a pretty good idea of what AP wrote, even though we don't have the originals, because the Daily Illini newspaper wrote a summary chronology of how AP reported the story on the newswire. The point here is that there are no wire service stories which have wording even remotely resembling what is present in the Ramey memo. (I have compiled an extensive collection of these 1947 Roswell news stories, which may also be viewed at my website: www.roswellproof.com/ press_coverage.html ) There would also be the additional problem of trying to make sense of phrases like \"the victims of the wreck you forwarded ...to Fort Worth.\" If this was a military mes- sage, then \"you\" would refer to the recipient of the mes- sage. But if this were a civilian message, then it should have been written in the third person: \"they forwarded\" would have used instead of \"you forwarded.\" Reporters certainly would not have been forwarding anything to Fort Worth. The evidence taken collectively overwhelmingly points to the message in Gen. Ramey's hand being a military, not a civilian teletype. \"Ramey\" or \"Temple\"? The fact that this is a military teletype also clearly im- plicates Gen. Ramey as being either the sender or recipi- ent of this message. This bears directly on whose name is on the signature line. The original \"Roswell Photo-interpretation Team\" as- sembled by photographer J. B. Johnson interpreted the signature as coming from somebody named \"Temple.\" So did some others who followed them, such as Neil Morris and Don Burleson. However, this always struck me as unlikely. Nobody knew of a mystery man named \"Temple\" in any way associated with the Roswell case. Ramey, on the other hand, was a known quantity, was in charge at Fort Worth, was holding the message, and had at least a 50/50 chance of being the sender. To my eye, the signa- ture always looked a bit \"Rameyish\" (although I could also see how it could be legitimately interpreted as \"Temple\"). Nonetheless, I was a fence-sitter on the issue for some time. The following factors finally swung me strongly over into the \"Ramey\" column. One issue is the number of letters in the word. I think the confusion in number stems from handwriting beneath the signature line slanting up and crossing over the end of the signature. There is also clearly some other handwriting beneath the last line of the message (appearing to say \"photos yes\" and perhaps \"stage\"). The second letter in the name is also clearly an \"A\" in high resolution and when en- hanced. That would rule out \"Temple.\" \"Ramey\" is also self-consistent with what I read in the message header, namely the teletype being directed to General \"Vandenberg\" at \"HQAAF\" in \"Washington,\" and being \"From: HQ 8th (AAF).\" The message also may begin with \"FWAAF acknowledges...\" All of this points to the message coming from Fort Worth and being sent to the Pentagon, i.e., this really being Ramey's mes- sage. Furthermore this has some historical backing from the press accounts. Newspapers reported that acting AAF chief Vandenberg was involved, dropping into the AAF press room at the Pentagon and personally directing phone calls to both Roswell and Gen. Ramey at Fort Worth af- ter the story broke. Ramey's phoned comments were also reported. It is certainly logical, therefore, that Ramey would be reporting up the chain of command, and even directly to Gen. Vandenberg for something of high import, and after already being contacted by phone. Additionally, the press accounts and Vandenberg's daily log indicate this occurring within one to two hours of when the Roswell base press release first hit the wires. The photos were taken very soon thereafter. Obviously the message had already been written before the photos were taken, and probably already sent, considering the folds in the paper and the added handwriting. The handwriting may be short notes by Ramey or a staff member ad- dressing issues raised by phone soon after sending of the message. E.g., I interpret the last line of the message as recom- mending follow-up debunking weather balloon demonstra- tions to bolster Ramey's weather balloon story. There were indeed a number of these in various parts of the country, including one at Fort Worth base two days later. The handwritten words \"photos yes\" directly beneath this may possibly refer to a suggestion that press photos of the debunking demonstrations should be added. One can additionally speculate that this may account for Ramey still handling the message. Ramey was hav- ing his photo taken with the weather balloon in his office, but he was also simultaneously planning his next moves. One has to remember that the total time between the first public announcement of the \"flying disk\" recovery at Roswell and the story-killing official identification as a weather balloon by Ramey's weather officer was only 3 hours. Ramey had to take care of a lot of business dur- ing this short time frame, and thus might be doing mul- tiple tasks simultaneously.

I was alone and driv- ing on IL A 81. At a few minutes after 9 PMI was about 4 miles west of Kewanee on a section of Rt 81 (near the intersection of Tower Rd). On the right (east) is hills and broken timber/pasture and on the left (west) are flat open tilled farm fields. I would have been traveling north. 1 suddenly noticed a red (red/orange) flashing light, thinking an emergency vehicle or deputy sheriff had sud- denly come up behind me. I had just purchased a new (1989) Ford F 150 pickup truck and had a fiberglass \"top- per\" installed that day. I was unfamiliar with the some- what obstructed field of view and the still new vehicle. I had not been drinking or using any drugs. I do recall being somewhat fatigued after a .long and busy day. I slowed and moved over to the shoulder of the road. As I came to a stop on the shoulder I was thinking I was being pulled over for some reason. I then realized the red or red/orange light was reflecting in the space between the back window of the truck and the topper. I shut the engine off at this point, thinking I had some kind of elec- trical problem. I opened the driver's door at about the same moment I realized the light was also reflected on the hood of the truck. I stepped out of the open driver's door to stand on the ground and realized that a large glowing sphere was positioned almost directly overhead. I estimated the ob- ject to be approx 50-70 ft above ground and approx 20-25 ft diameter. It was smooth and glassy appearing on its surface, which was most noticeable between the brighter intensity pulses. I want to emphasize that these \"pulses\" were not flashes, as in on-off, but were pulsations of brighter-dimmer, never shutting off completely. I also no- ticed a strong definite static field that increased in unison with the pulses of brighter light. I could not visualize the surface of the object when the light pulses were at peak intensity. During the less in- tense/dim phase of the light pulses the surface was clearly visible and totally featureless from my point of view. The surface was very smooth and glass-like, transparent, and within appeared a swirling, smoky or viscous liquid type substance against the inner surface. From what was visible to me, I would insist this object was a perfect globe or sphere and emitted light from its entire outside surface. Over the next 1-2 minutes the qual- ity and duration of the bright/dim light cycle changed to a longer bright and shorter dim, but the frequency of the light cycle seemed constant-it did not pulse faster, just longer and brighter pulses with shorter dim intervals until it approached constant bright \"ON.\" I could feel the static field intensify also. I did not move from my position next to the truck between the open door and cab. I had the feeling that something was going to happen with the changes in the light emissions and static field, but did not know what to expect. When the light pulses became a constant \"ON,\" the object very suddenly shot west with a departure so rapid that there was a vacuum \"'POP.\" I can only describe it as being like a huge cork violently pulled from a bottle. I was aware of no noise prior to this moment. The object stopped very suddenly in the western sky for a few seconds (3-5 miles away?), then seemed to change directions approximately 90 degrees to due north for a couple of miles, stopping suddenly again for only a moment, then disappearing to the western horizon. My next recollection was the realization that I was sitting in my parked truck in my back yard (approx 2 miles north of the site described) with the truck pointing west and watching the western sky where the object disap- peared. This was not where I would typically park. I walked into the house a few minutes before 1 PM, so I was evidently in the truck for some time. It was a very pleasant evening, both in temperature and weather, and I recall an overall feeling of stunned amazement. I do not recall ever feeling fear or apprehension. I realize that some time is unaccounted for, but I have attributed that to some kind of emotional shock. I have remained in excellent health. Until recently I was not aware of MUFON, and I have only told three close friends or family members about this incident in the past 12+ years. I do not want my name used publicly, but I do want to report this to those who might compile information of this type. I am an active member in my small town community and I don't desire attention. Mr. Driscoll has interviewed me in a most pro- fessional manner, and for that I am grateful. March 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Filer's Files By George A.

ATKINS — The Director of NUFORC, Peter Dav- enport, spoke with an eyewitness to the Shuttle disaster, who reports that both he and his grandchildren had wit- nessed a green, self-luminous object move toward the Space Shuttle very quickly, seemingly from the southwest, as the Shuttle streaked across the Texas sky. The witness estimated that they first noticed the object an estimated two seconds after they had first seen the Shuttle in the sky to the northwest, and just prior to the shuttle's explosion. He was there with his grandchildren watching for Columbia's re-entry and watched as it crossed from horizon to horizon. The witness stated, \"I can't imagine having a better overall van- tage point than the spot where we stood. I saw...green light, explosion, sonic boom, etc.\" CNN and radio (700 WLW) said, \"The Air Force re- ported tracking an 'object' moving alongside Columbia on Jan. 17, 2003, one day and 20 minutes into the mission.while the shuttle was still in space. They said it \"may\" have been a piece of the shuttle, but they don't know yet.\" NASA officials confirmed that military radar at Eglin Air Force Base spotted a mysterious object near Columbia. The object moved away from the Shuttle at 10 miles per hour. During the first few hours of the coverage of the di- saster, released video showed an object following the Shuttle about an estimated thousand feet behind the Shuttle that seemed to launch a bolt of lightning like plasma to- ward the Shuttle. David Perlman of The San Francisco Chronicle viewed the photos later that night, and on Sunday the Chronicle reported an electrified discharge seen around the track of the shuttle's passage. \"They clearly record an electrical discharge like a lightning bolt flashing past,\" said the photographer. NASA dispatched former shuttle astronaut Tammy Jernigan to acquire the camera. A Chronicle reporter was present when Jemigan arrived. \"It certainly appears very anomalous,\" she said. \"We sure will be very inter- ested in taking a very hard look at this.\" DALLAS - Another viewer writes, \"While watching the news on CNN Saturday morning about the explosion Page 12 of the Shuttle, CNN showed a video of the Shuttle com- ing in from a front view. In the video the shuttle is coming from the left top hand of the screen downwards towards the right. \"There was a cloud in front of it with the sun reflecting on it, making it glow. All of a sudden from the bottom left hand corner of the screen, dark-shaped objects zipped upwards across the sky towards the right hand corner. It was moving quite fast and disappeared in seconds. \"My 14-year-old son and I looked at each other and both said at the same time, 'What the heck was that?' We watched all day long for them to show the particular clip again, but they never did.

When we looked again some ten minutes later, it had moved about a foot at arm's length, which is too far for a celestial object to move in a short time frame. \"Fifteen minutes later, we both saw that it had disap- peared! As I drove her to work, we saw contrails of two very fast moving jets converging on the exact spot where the light had been. They crossed this same patch of sky over and over again in an 'x' pattern. They seemed to be searching for the object for about fifteen minutes. \"I returned home, got binoculars to observe, and could only make out the contrails (puffy, and definitely corkscrewed) converging again and again on this same spot for at least 30 minutes. \"Then the light reappeared, and I saw it was round with a shadow! Both jets made tight turns and converged on the spot again. They were a foot away at arm's length when the light blinked off! As the planes crossed each other, I saw the light reappear to the south two feet away at arm's length! Again, the jets executed tight rums and converged on the same spot, only to have the light disap- pear again. \"This occurred two more times, and then the light dis- appeared totally.

BURKE — The witness reports, \"At about 1 PM on Jan. 31, 2003,1 was outside, camcorder in hand, filming the chemtrails, and after five minutes of taping I saw what I thought was a passenger jet flying through a chemtrail. \"I rolled tape on it for about 30 seconds.

Strange object viewed off Florida coast ORCHID ISLAND — The witness reports, \"I am a security guard for an exclusive gated community and a retired police officer who is inherently skeptic about most non-factual things.

I routinely look up and down the beach for small boats or boats out in the ocean because there is a lot of drug smuggling along the Treasure Coast. \"It was clear, and the sky was full of stars. I saw a light on the horizon of the ocean, almost due east. At first I thought it was a fishing boat out on the Gulf Stream. However, I noticed the light seemed a little high off the horizon for the mast of a fishing boat. \"It was pitch black out there, and all of a sudden the light shot up into the sky, going very high. It looked like an amber star-a small star or one that is very far away. Of course I was astonished and began observing it. It ap- peared to be stationary in the sky, then all of a sudden moving right, then left, and making loops like a helicopter. \"This went on for a while, so I went back to my cruiser and got out the 10X binoculars, and this object emitted its own source of light and had red areas on its surface and was oval in shape. I had another officer observe the ob- ject and he said, 'That thing is dancing.' I locked my arms in a bipod position, holding the binoculars in one position. \"The object would move out of my field of view and come back.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly In the wake of the latest disaster in the NASA space program, the courage and danger which were part of the 1969 voyage to the moon takes on even more significance. If there is still danger in 2003 in something as seemingly routine as landing a shuttle, consider the potential prob- lems in getting to the moon and back without a mishap more than 30 years ago. This book is basically a transcript of a discussion between the three astro- nauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, during the debrief- ing which followed their historic journey. The topics ranged from technical concerns to the problems they had shaving- but also included descriptions of an unknown object. The debriefing was closed to the press, and was origi- nally classified material. This is the first publication of the debriefing, which was obtained under the Freedom of In- formation Act. A comprehensive listing of acronyms used by the astronauts is provided by Godwin, and this is very helpful in understanding the discussion. Of special interest to ufologists is the following con- versation, which begins on page 38: ALDRIN - The first unusual thing that we saw, I guess, was one day out or something pretty close to the moon. It had a sizeable dimension to it, so we put the monocular on it. COLLINS - How'd we see this thing? Did we just look out the window and there it was? ALDRIN - Yes, and we weren't sure but that it might be the S-IVB [Saturn third stage]. We called the ground and were told the S-IVB was 6000 miles away. We had a problem with the high gain about this time, didn't we? COLLINS - There was something. We felt a bump, or maybe I just imagined it. ARMSTRONG - He was wondering whether the MESA [Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly] had come off. COLLINS -1 don't guess we felt anything. ALDRIN - Of course, we were seeing all sorts of little objects going by at the various dumps, and then we happened to see this one brighter object going by. We couldn't think of anything else it could be other than the S-IVB. We looked at it through the monocular, and it seemed to have a bit of an L shape to it. ARMSTRONG - Like an open suitcase. ALDRIN - We were in PTC [Passive Thermal Con- trol] at the time, so each one of us had a chance to take a look at this, and it certainly seemed to be within our vicin- ity and of a very sizeable dimension. ARMSTRONG - We should say that it was right at the limit of the resolution of the eye. It was very difficult to tell just what shape it was. And there was no way to tell the size without knowing the range, or the range with- out knowing the size. ALDRIN - So then I got down in the LEB [Lower Equipment Bay] and started looking for it in the optics. We were grossly misled, because with the sextant off focus what we saw appeared to be a cylinder. ARMSTRONG - Or really two rings. ALDRIN - Yes. ARMSTRONG - Two rings. Two connected rings. COLLINS - No, it looked like a hollow cylinder to me. It didn't look like two connected rings. You could see this thing tumbling, and when it came around end-on, you could look right down in its guts. It was a hollow cylinder. But then you could change the focus on the sextant and it would be replaced by this open-book shape. It was really weird. ALDRIN -1 guess there's not too much more to say about it, other than it wasn't a cylinder. COLLINS - It was during the period when we thought it was a cylinder that we inquired about the S-IVB, and we'd almost convinced ourselves that's what it had to be. But we don't have any more conclusions than that really. The fact that we didn't see it much past this one time period-we really don't have a conclusion as to what it might have been, how big it was, or how far away it was. It was something that wasn't part of the urine dump, we're pretty sure of that. Skipping ahead a bit, when we jetti- soned the LM [Lunar Module], you know we fired an explosive charge and got rid of the docking rings and the LM went boom. Pieces came off the LM. It could have been some Mylar or something that had somehow come loose from the LM. ALDRIN - We thought it could have been a panel, but it didn't appear to have that shape at all. COLLINS - That's right, and for some reason, we thought it might have been a part of the high gain an- tenna. It might have been about the time we had high gain antenna problems. In the back of my mind, I have some reason to suspect that its origin was from the spacecraft. ALDRIN - The other observation that I made accu- mulated gradually. I don't know whether I saw it the first night, but I'm sure I saw it the second night. I was trying to go to sleep with all the lights out. I observed what I thought were little flashes inside the cabin, spaced a couple of minutes apart, and I didn't think too much about it other than just a note in my mind that they continued to be there. I couldn't explain why my eye would see these flashes. During trans-earth coast, we had more time and I de- voted more opportunity to investigating what this could have been. It was at that point that I was able to observe on two different occasions that, instead of observing just Page 14 MUFON UFO Journal March 2003"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"one flash, I could see double flashes, at points separated by maybe a foot. At other times, I could see a line with no direction of motion, and the only thing that comes to my mind is that this is some sort of penetration. At least that's my guess, without much to support it-some penetration of some object into the spacecraft that causes an emis- sion as it enters the cabin itself. Sometimes it was one flash on entering. Possibly de- parting from an entirely different part of the cabin, out- side the field of view. The double flashes appeared to have an entry and then impact on something such as the struts. For a while, I thought it might have been some static electricity, because I was also able, in moving my hand up and down the sleep restraint, to generate very small sparks of static electricity. But there was a definite difference between the two as I observed it more and more. I tried to correlate this with the direction of the sun. When you put the window shades up there is still a small amount of leakage. You can generally tell within 20 or 30 degrees the direction of the sun. It seemed as though they were coming from that general direction; however, I re- ally couldn't say if there was near enough evidence to support that these things were observable on the side of the spacecraft where the sun was. A little bit of evidence seemed to support this. I asked the others if they had seen any of these and, until about the last day, they hadn't. ARMSTRONG - Buzz, I'd seen some light, but I just always attributed this to sunlight, because the window covers leak a little bit of light no matter how tightly se- cured. The only time I observed it was the last night when we really looked for it. I spent probably an hour carefully watching the inside of the spacecraft, and I probably made 50 significant observations in this period ALDRIN - Sometimes a minute or two would go by and then you'd see two within the space of 10 seconds. On an average, I'd say just as a guess it was maybe some- thing like one a minute. Certainly more than enough to convince you that it wasn't an optical illusion. It did give you a rather funny feeling to contemplate that something was zapping through the cabin. There wasn't anything you could do about it. ARMSTRONG - It could be something like Buzz sug- gested. Mainly a neutron or some kind of an atomic par- ticle that would be in the visible spectrum. Even aside from the preceding discussion of the un- known object and the light flashes in the cabin, this is a very interesting book which provides insights into the mis- sion that are normally missed by the public. The accom- panying CDROM is also fascinating, and includes such scenes as the planting of the American flag on the sur- face of the moon.

Unlike many books, this one lives up to its title: i.e. scien- tific methods are actually used in evaluating UFO cases. The authors are retired professors from the college of education at Drake University in Des Moines, IA. Joslin worked in the sciences, and Bragg in the social sciences, which may account for the scholarly approach. Bragg has been a member of MUFON for more than twenty years, so is no newcomer to the field. The book is well organized, with a good introduction to ufology, moving from a his- torical summary to specific cases. One of the highlights is the chapter reviewing UFO literature, classified into six categories: general, extra- terrestrial, abductions, scien- tific, and skeptic. The reviews include 68 books and papers, most de- scribed briefly, but some de- scriptions covering multiple pages. The reviews feature many of the Who's Who of ufology, such as Kenneth Arnold, Ted Bloecher, Edward Ruppelt, Jacques Vallee, Leonard Strngfield, Coral & Jim Lorenzen, Donald Keyhoe, Ed Walters, Bruce Maccabee, Raymond Fowler, Stanton Friedman, Isabel Davis, J. Allen Hynek, Ted Phillips, Kevin Randle, Donald Schmitt, Philip Corso, Colin Andrews, Linda Moulton Howe, Tom Adams, John Fuller, Budd Hopkins, John Mack, Whitley Strieber, David Jacobs, John Carpenter, Carl Sagan, Ri- chard Hall, James McCampbell, Edward Condon, James Harder, Richard Haines, Peter Srurrock, Paul Hill, Philip Klass, and Donald Menzel. Bragg and Joslin are kinder to skeptics Klass and Menzel than these two \"bunkers\" deserve, and the au- thors apparently still feel that Col. Corso may be legiti- mate, but overall their judgement is sound in reviewing the numerous authors. Bragg and Joslin tackle the problem of applying sci- ence to the study of UFO cases in Chapter 3, opening with a brief history of science, then discussing some of the currently-accepted processes of scientific investiga- tion. They look at six possible hypotheses regarding UFOs, and set up the criteria which they will use in determining if specific UFO cases are genuine. They determine that \"the null hypothesis\" is the most satisfactory approach, contrasting it with the positive hy- pothesis. For example, a positive hypothesis might be stated as: \"UFOs exist as real physical objects about which there are no current scientific explanations.\" If stated as a null March 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"hypothesis it would be: \"Flying objects presently identi- fied as unknown can be identified as known and explained with known scientific principles.\" This second hypothesis, the authors explain, turns all UFO reports into IFOs. \"If all UFOs can be explained as known objects, the null hypothesis must be accepted,\" say Bragg and Joslin, but \"if even one substantiated case is found that cannot be so explained, then the null hypoth- esis must be rejected. The advantage of the null hypoth- esis is that only one case is required to refute it.\" The authors use this approach on five specific UFO cases, setting up the following criteria for judging the va- lidity of each case: (1) multiple witnesses, (2) credible witnesses, (3) data from instruments, (4) strangeness, and (5) link-by-link evidence. All of the five criteria need not be present for determining that a case is genuine, but each adds strength to the case. This appears to be a good way to organize data in look- ing at a case-something which good researchers prob- ably do anyway, but in a less precise manner. One could question the choice and presentations of a couple of the cases used as examples. The first case, the Gulf Breeze sightings of Ed and Frances Walters, has hardly been free from controversy, yet the number and credibility of the witnesses is rated at \"a high level.\" While this may indeed by a legitimate case-as supported by the very credible Bruce Maccabee and MUFON-it may not be one of the five best cases for demonstrating the scien- tific approach. Case two is the Coyne helicopter sighting of 1973, case three involved scientists and instrumentation, case four is the well-documented Barney and Betty Hill abduction, and case five the Linda Cortile abduction-a case with its own share of problems, despite the high credibility of the investigator, Budd Hopkins. Again, this is not to suggest that the Cortile abduction did not occur, but it may not have been one of the best choices for the demonstration, given some of the ques- tions regarding witnesses. The authors determine that all five cases are probably legitimate. There is additional interesting and well-presented ma- terial on \"Testing the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis.\" The authors resist the temptation to utilize wild statements by self-styled experts, presenting instead the available legiti- mate evidence in a careful manner. Topping off this excellent book is a good index, exten- sive references, and even a glossary.

Fawcett, UFO Store.com, 16235 SW Westwind Drive, Beaverton, OR 97007-2050 (also available from the author at 602 Battle- ground Rd., Lincolnton, NC 28092), 8/2X11, soft cover, 41 pages, $22.95 ppd. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This publ ication is composed of two studies from the 1980's. The author is a veteran researcher who previously published Quar- ter Century Studies of UFOs in Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee (1975), now out of print. Fawcett researched the first study-on human reactions to UFOs-by requesting reports from all over the world. After receiving these reports, he organized them into 32 cat- egories, such as \"Healings and other positive effects,\" \"Emotional shock,\" \"Changes in normal habits and activi- ties,\" \"Blind panic,\" and \"Acts of self defense from UFOs.\" Under each category he briefly describes one or more cases from the 1940-1983 time period. He notes that his four-year study indicates that human reactions to UFOs are both consistent and persistent throughout the world. In the second study, looking at what we have learned from UFO repetitions, Fawcett discusses specific aspects of UFO sightings which had been repeated throughout the world during the 1947-1984 period of his study, and which continue today. These include radar trackings, increases in background radiation, photos and movies, physiological effects, electro- magnetic interference, specific odors, contactee reports, appearances of \"little men,\" periodical cycles of sightings, unique UFO shapes, traces left at landing sites, animal reactions, levitation of people and vehicles, and 14 other categories of repetitions. This is not a large publication, but it does provide his- torical perspective, insights from a respected veteran ufologist, and much food for thought as researchers con- tinue to ponder what is behind the UFO phenomenon.

Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal March 2003"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"View from Britain By Jenny Randies Jennv Randies One in Ten Recently I was asked on a media interview a question often posed by skeptical people when it comes to UFOs. \"You say,\" I was politely reminded, \"that perhaps one in ten sightings relate to genuine UFOs, whereas the other 90 per cent can be explained in mundane terms. Why then,\" the question was thrust at me like a lance being parried, \"can you not accept that those one in ten are also likely to be explained if you had sufficient time or information?\" It is, of course, a good ques- tion, but one I do not think is without an answer. So, after explaining that in truth I sus- pected that maybe only one in five (not one in ten) repre- sented truly unsolved UFO cases, I attempted to give my reasoning, which I thought I would share with readers this month. What are solved cases? What factors cause a case to be solved? Quite simply the UFO (being an unidentified flying object) is investi- gated, researched, checked against various credible ex- planations, and an identification is found that makes good sense. It becomes an IFO (identified flying object). Of course, it is rare that we really solve a case in any cast iron beyond all doubt sense of the term. Usually an explanation suggests itself that makes more sense of the evidence than would clinging to the expectation that it was truly unexplained. For instance, we might say that a bright object that whizzes past the cockpit of an airliner and is reported by the crew as a rocket shaped craft was in truth a fireball meteor. If we are just guessing that is not a very ad- equate (although potentially plausible) resolution. If we have evidence from scientific observations that such an object was seen at that time and date in the right part of the sky by independent observers and recorded by astronomers as a meteor, then we are on much more se- cure ground when arguing that our airline sighting should be considered solved. But it is still an educated guess. The other witnesses might have seen the UFO and misinterpreted it as a me- teor, for example. All we can do, in practically every case, is make a reasoned value judgement of the evidence. Common sense, experience, and our knowledge of the universe tells us that, whilst we will occasionally consign to the label of \"solved cases\" a sighting that in truth should have re- mained unexplained, most of the time we will err cor- rectly on the side of caution and properly regard a dubi- ous case as being an IFO. There are always going to be gray areas. For instance, we might have (as I once did) a multiple witness sighting of what was very clearly a piece of space junk burning up in the atmosphere. Most of the sightings fitted the pattern of the event that was tracked by NORAD, and there was no argument. However, in one case a witness saw something that occurred at the same time and with similar characteris- tics and yet which they described in graphic terms as a classic UFO. Was this merely an extremely exaggerated IFO based upon the space junk, or had a witness chanced to see a genuine UFO at the same time as many others were watching the atmospheric spectacular? Both options are possible, and we can only form an opinion on the most credible way of interpreting all the facts at our disposal. Patterns within the evidence: But do IFO cases reveal any patterns? Well, yes and no. Certainly there are key features that help an investi- gator look for an IFO option within the details of a re- ported sighting. For instance, if a UFO is reported to resemble a puls- ing light in the pre dawn sky that stays more or less in one place for an hour, but fades as the sky lightens, most UFOlogists would think right away that this was probably Venus or a bright star, and access to astronomical data would rapidly establish if that were the case. We can identify IFO profiles for most types of phe- nomena-allowing, in fact, all good investigators to use flow charts and other data based on their experience to run any case through a number of options checked against the witness story to test for the main options. Indeed, it is possible (and I am surprised no enterpris- ing UFOlogist seems to have done it yet) to come up with a computer-based IFO diagnostic tool that could be em- ployed by UFOlogists and witnesses (if it were placed on line) to test their sighting against the main IFO possibili- ties. However, the real problem is that every type of IFO has its own unique pattern of markers that suggest this explanation. And UFO sightings are a mixture of dozens of different IFO possibilities. How do you allow for pa- rameters that cover common place IFO such as aircraft lights as well as much rarer ones like mirages or your granny's hat caught in the wind ? This multi-faceted nature of UFOs and IFOs also makes it difficult to look for differences between the cumulative solved and unsolved data. For these are sets of evidence March 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"built out of many different things. However, attempts have been made and offer some comfort. The vital difference Studies were made in the 1950s by Batelle in the USA and in the 1970s by GEPAN in France. Both, in effect, sought any differences between (1) the data regarded as solved after careful investigation and (2) the evidence still considered unexplained. In both cases there were per- suasive indications that these subsets of evidence were not the same. One of the key findings from the atmospheric scien- tists working in Toulouse was that the unsolved cases increased in correlation to the clarity of the atmosphere, whereas the reverse was true for the cases considered solved. This is a remarkable finding, and one of the pieces of evidence I regard as probative. After all, you would expect misinterpretations to grow in numbers the worse the quality of visibility became. You are less likely to correctly interpret a weather balloon or aircraft if it is misty. If the unsolved cases were simply more of the same-that is, solved cases for which we do not yet have all the necessary evidence-you would ex- pect them to follow a similar trend. That the unsolved cases seem to have excellent atmo- spheric clarity associated lessens the chances that they are simply misperceptions, and indiates a critical differ- ence that can be measured between them and the ones regarded as being solved. In conclusion In the end, of course, your belief in UFOs may come down to personal conviction-perhaps through your own sighting or a powerful case that you have investigated and that seems to defy all the odds. Whilst I do not under- value the importance of such matters, it is wise to re- member that there is no such thing as the perfect UFO. All cases are open to explanation sooner or later if that little piece of luck or defining evidence comes along that makes an IFO solution suddenly clarify. That there is evidence beyond the mere \"gut feeling\" that something strange is going on has to be important. UFOlogy is not only about individual cases, but about a collection of evidence that points towards the possibility that something beyond current scientific knowledge might be taking place. 2002 Symposium Proceedings The MUFON 2002 International UFO Sympo- sium Proceedings book is available from MUFON Headquarters for $25 + $2.50 p&h (U.S.).

No humans yet Teleportation gets a boost as scientists move laser photons From an-idea that was only considered practicable 10 years ago, scientists recently announced that they have succeeded in teleporting laser photons over two kilome- ters (1.25 miles), the biggest distance yet achieved. In science fiction, teleportation involves taking some- one and creating a replica of him or her a long distance away, and destroying the original. The perceived barrier to it was something called the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that the more accurately you try to scan or measure an atom or other object in order to teleport it, the more you disrupt its original quantum state, and so you cannot create a true replica. Things changed in 1993 with a landmark paper by a team led by an IBM scientist, Charles Bennett, who thought up a way of getting around this problem using photons, or particles of light, as the object to be transported. Their answer was to exploit something called \"quan- tum entanglement,\" in which a laser beam is squeezed and split in such a way that it creates two particles of light at the same time. Particles created in this exotic process behave like psychic twins. Even if they are far apart, a disturbance to one particle affects the other, a phenomenon once dubbed \"spooky interaction\" by Einstein. Their idea was to use these \"en- tangled\" particles as transporters. By introducing a third \"message\" particle into the light stream, one could trans- fer its properties to both sets of particles. It would work like this: One of the \"twin\" beams is scanned, which in the process destroys its quantum state. The information is sent to the recipient via a classical communications channel, and is transformed back into a light beam. The recipient then combines this light beam with the second entangled beam he has received, and in so doing \"unwraps\" the original message in its virgin state. The first concrete results from this idea began emerg- ing in 1997, with a couple of labs in Europe and the United States transporting a small unit of information, called a quantum bit (qubit) a distance of about one meter (3.25 feet). But, in a study reported recently in the British weekly journal Nature, scientists at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, and the University of Aarhus, Denmark, have teleported data to another lab 55 meters (178 feet) away through a 2-kilometer (1.25-mile) roll of standard fibre- optic cable. In spite of the breakthrough, teleportation is still re- stricted to light particles. No-one is even close to teleporting an atom or a bacteria, much less a human being. \"The first (and, with foreseeable technologies, the only) application of quantum teleportation is in quantum com- munication, where it could help extend quantum cryptog- raphy to larger distances,\" the authors, led by Geneva University's Nicolas Gisin, said.

I was driving from my home in Fredericton, New Brunswick, to my post office box in Houlton, ME, as I usually do on Saturday morning and listening to National Public Radio, when I first heard that communications had been lost with the Columbia Space Shuttle. It felt like a kick in the head. I tried to keep tabs over the next week about what new information was being obtained. As it happened I had spoken many years ago at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, so at least I knew where the town was. Because a lot of radio people know that I worked on space re- lated Research and Development programs years ago, there were several calls from talk show hosts asking for my views about the tragedy. What was there to say that hadn't already been said? All seven astronauts were obviously the best of the best, both as talented professionals and as people. Obviously, I didn't know what caused the disaster. But what I gradually began to focus on was the failure of NASA to provide real leadership and goal orientation, es- pecially for the manned space program. NASA has not articulated a goal as a follow-up to President Kennedy's 1961 call for placing a man on the moon by the end of the decade. One would think that the space station would be a step- ping stone, not an end in itself. Other than keeping budget money flowing, there has been no clarion call, such as establishing a lunar base by a certain date or sending a man to Mars by a later date. I am often reminded of a meeting I was asked to attend at Aerojet General Corpo- ration in Sacramento, CA, when I was working on the Nerva nuclear rocket program at Westinghouse Astronuclear lab near Pittsburgh, PA, in about 1968. The purpose of the meeting, which was sponsored by the NASA Space Nuclear Propulsion Office, was to dis- cuss \"What should we do with the nuclear Rocket?\" They didn't know!! Should we use it to establish a lunar base? Perhaps to ferry supplies from earth orbit to Lunar orbit? As an upper stage for a manned mission to Mars? No conclusion was reached, and the program was cancelled within a few years, not because it wasn't successful, but because there was no goal. There were many successful tests of ground based nuclear rocket engines at the Nuclear Test site in Ne- vada. The testing of our NRX A-6 nuclear engine was terminated at a full 60 minutes at full power (1100 Mega- watts) and nominal high temperature and pressure for the liquid hydrogen cooled system. Los Alamos tested their Phoebus 2B engine, still under 7 feet in diameter, at a power level of 4400 megawatts. But there was no program goal, no leadership, no vi- sion. Essentially the same thing had happened when I worked for the General Electric Aircraft Nuclear Propul- sion Department in the late 1950s. The Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission couldn't decide what they wanted to do with the aircraft, which would have practi- cally unlimited range since essentially no fuel was used during flight. Should the first plane be designed to be a high altitude bomber? Or a plane to come in low, toss its nuclear bombs, and come back high? Should it be a very large cargo plane able to deliver a huge load anywhere in the world? Or a tug to tow a bunch of regular planes for. most of their flight to distant places? Without a goal and an outstanding leader, funding is lost. Werner Von Braun did provide leadership for the Apollo program. An excellent example of leadership was provided by Admiral Hyman Rickover, who directed the navy nuclear reactor development program. Despite the opposition of the battleship boys, nuclear submarines make perfect sense in retrospect, since they can remain hidden and be ready to launch their missiles anytime from any- where. It is easy to forget that the development of the Polaris missile occurred after the submarine's development. Nuclear powered naval task forces can sail full steam ahead for years without refuelling and are independent of the oil supply lines so difficult to maintain in wartime. Speed of oil fired ships is very dependent on supplies, since higher speeds use up fuel quickly. The nuclear navy demonstrates Friedman's law: Tech- nological progress comes from doing things differently in an unpredictable way. A nuclear reactor is not just a bet- ter furnace. Lasers aren't just better light bulbs. This directly relates to my discussion about flying sau- cer technology. Namely that the propulsion systems of civilizations well ahead of us will use techniques about which we know nothing for both propulsion and long dis- tance communications-one of many reasons I am not a booster of the radio telescope-based Search for Extrater- restrial Intelligence (SETI). The evidence already indi- cates that aliens are coming here. Why listen for signals with a very primitive technique? Concerning the shuttle, we must recognize that funda- mentally it is the same as all our high power rockets have been for decades: use chemical propellants to produce lift to lift the propellant to lift the propellant to finally lift a March 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"payload small in comparison to the initial launch weight. The modern world of computers illustrates my law. We went from using vacuum tubes which use so much energy that huge amounts of air conditioning are required to transistors which substantially reduced the size, weight and energy consumption, to integrated circuits, again re- ducing size and weight and energy requirements, to today's tiny but very powerful micro integrated circuits which use very little energy indeed to accomplish a lot more, more quickly. But micro integrated circuits are NOT just small vacuum rubes. Very different physics is involved. NASA has looked fairly briefly at other approaches involving chemical rocketry techniques for launching pay- loads to orbit, such as starting the rocket while it is aloft hung from a large airplane. What they haven't done is try an entirely new approach. I don't recommend nuclear rocket engines for lift-off. They are not high thrust sys- tems, and there are certain safety considerations on the ground that don't apply in the vacuum of space. But we seem to have done very little to try to emulate flying saucers, which seem hot at all to use systems which work by lifting something in order to throw it away. Even automobiles at least take advantage of the ready avail- ability of air, rather than carry a huge tank of liquid oxy- gen to burn with the gasoline. An approach of particular interest to me is the use of a magnetoaerodynamic system which ionizes the air around it and then interacts with that plasma with electric and magnetic fields to control lift, drag, thrust, sonic boom production, radar profile, and other good characteristics- especially when one can use superconducting magnets. Such systems would, in principle, be much like the elec- tromagnetic submarine successfully built and tested at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1966 by Westinghouse Research Laboratory scientist Dr. Stewart Way. A Japanese conglomerate actually operated a some- what different design using superconducting magnets many years later. It should be stressed that seawater is an electrically conducting fluid, as is ionized air, and there are no moving parts. Leading up to President Bush's budget message was a lot of talk on the internet that Project Prometheus would receive a lot of funding, leading to the development of new nuclear systems to speed up manned space explora- tion. Some of the coverage was very confused. There are indeed several ways in which nuclear en- ergy can be used for space flight. All our deep space probes (Pioneer, Voyager, Cassini etc) have used Radio- isotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs), which use al- pha particles from Plutonium-238 to heat a small capsule and, because of a temperature difference between it and its surroundings, produce electricity. These have no moving parts, are very sturdy, cannot provide a chain reaction, last for a very long time, and are very safe and reliable. Of course, unlike solar cells, they produce the same power whether near or far from the sun. There are also several different designs for a com- pact nuclear reactor (size of a waste basket) producing larger amounts of power which can be used, for example, to operate side band radar for monitoring ships from orbit (The Russians used more than 30 of these), to providing power for various electric propulsion schemes, which would have low thrust, but operate for months or years, to providing power for space-based laser or ion beam weapons. To date the US has operated only one of these reac- tors, a not very good system, the SNAP 10A. I still don't fully understand why the space station doesn't use a nuclear system instead of the huge solar panels. I sus- pect the biggest reason is lack of vision, courage, and leadership. The current Prometheus discussion could have taken place 30 years ago! Where was the leadership and the vision of what we want man to do in space? I still don't see it. I don't see any Admiral Rickover type leading the way. An additional question for which I have never had a satisfactory answer is why the USA didn't launch Apollo 18 and 19? The hardware was all built. The crews had been selected and trained. President Nixon said it was to save money. But almost all the bills had already been paid. Yes, I am aware that some have suggested that the aliens secretly told us to stay off their moon.... At best an idea in my grey basket. So the big question is, do we Earthlings want to take dominion over the solar system, or do we wish to con- tinue to be a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare? I am certain that the lost astronauts had greater vision than that. Scientist thinks Mars was once wet and warm Recent research suggests that early Mars was cold most of the time, and warmed up only when asteroids impacted the planet, but Dr. James F. Kasting, a member of Penn State's NASA-sponsored Astrobiology Research Center, does not think this is correct. Speaking at the American Association for the Advance- ment of Science meeting in February, Dr. Kasting said that Mars had to be continuously warmer to form the planet's deep valleys: \"I do not think there was enough time involved to form the types of features that we see on the Martian landscape.\" The half-mile to more than a mile wide channel at the bottom of Nanedi Vallis is about 100 feet across, says Kasting. The Martian surface could have received 20-30 de- grees Fahrenheit additional warming from the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide ice clouds. Researchers now think that Mars has a supply of water, which is required for all terrestrial life. Evidence of methanobacteria could be found in subsurface fossils, or the bacteria could still be there today. \"What we need to do is go and take samples,\" said Kasting. NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Mission, scheduled to launch later this year, will have two robotic vehicles that will sample soils, looking for signs of life.

Matteson of Norfolk, NE for his donation of NICAP UFO Investigator Newslet- ters and a book on the Switzerland UFO Incident to the MUFON archives. New Level of Comfort at MUFON Headquarters The public meeting area at MUFON Headquarters includes 50 folding metal chairs. In the winter these chairs can get a bit cold and hard, making an uncomfortable situation for people attending long meetings. Colorado MUFON member Gail Barton recently rem- edied this situation by donating padded cushions for all the chairs. A big thank you goes out to Gail. When does my membership/subscription expire? The answer to this question appears on the mailing label on each Journal (see example be- low) 01/05 Name Street Address City, State, Zip The first line on the label provides the answer. The first two numbers show the year of expira- tion (01=2001, 02=2002, etc). The two numbers after the slash show the month of expiration and show the last issue that will be mailed (05=May, 08=Aug, ll=Nov, etc.). Page 24 MUFON UFO Journal March 2003"}]
