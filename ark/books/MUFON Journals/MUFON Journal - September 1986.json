FROM THE EDITOR The skeptics, if they're true to their precepts, will have to address the May spate of UFO sightings in Brazil. For the first time in recent memory the military establishment of a foreign country called a press conference to discuss UFO reports which involved the scrambling of their own jet fighters and both visual and radar contact by trained professional flyers. Unfortunately, those cases are a continent away and may never receive the treatment they seemingly deserve. In the meantime, we include here two reports based largely on media reports and early correspondence with local civilian investigators. We feel confident more will follow. Closer to home we have the Petaluma, California, case and the \"daily diary\" investigation, resulting in an IFO, reported by eyewitness Walter Webb, a model of persistence and technique. Also interesting are Barry Greenwood's thoughts on Project Moon Dust and England's Hilary Evans' ruminations on scientists and ufologists - who needs who? In fact, this is such an information-filled issue in general that we'll get out of the way and let you have at it.

THE CHASE Late Monday night,, May 19, 1986, Ozires Silva, head of the '• state oil company, was preparing to land his Brazilian-made Xingu aircraft at an air force base at Sao Jose dos Compos, 66 miles from the industrial heartland of Sao Paulo, Brazil. He first saw three colored lights in his path which were also picked up on his aircraft radar. Mr. Silva cancelled his landing, informed the Brazilian Defense Center and chased the fast-moving lights, which were described as resembling ping- pong balls. \"Because they saturated our radar system in Sao Paulo and because they were interfering with air traffic, it was decided to send up planes to pursue them,\" Brigadier General Otavio Moreira Lima said. The Air Space Defense Center had located the lights over the cities of Sao Paulo, Sao Jose dos Campos and Rio de Janeiro on their radar. . The .Defense Center, entered a \"state of alert\" and sent three F-5E jet fighters after the lights, pursuing the objects. Air Force Minister Octavio Moreira Lima said pilots of the planes dispatched to pursue the mysterious objects Monday night saw.green, red and white lights that moved between 160 and 990 mph and picked up solid objects on the radar. Lima said the three jet fighters came as close as 4 miles to the objects. \"At one point the chase was inverted when a F-5E fighter was surrounded by 13 colored lights and chased with seven on one side and six on the other,\" Lima said. The fighters pursued the objects for 30 minutes toward the Sao Paulo coast before they ran low on fuel and had to give up the chase, the O G/obo newspaper reported. After the F-5E's ran low of fuel, three supersonic Mirage-3 fighters armed with Sidewinder and Matra 530 missiles were sent to continue the chase. They detected the objects on radar, but were unable to see the lights, Lima said. The President of Brazil, Jose Sarney was told late Monday night about the chase. Lima said Sarney was \"interested and curious\" about the event. \"In the six years that I have worked with the Defense Center I never saw anything similar,\" Head of Operations Major Neu Cerqueira told the O Ghbo newspaper. PILOT REPORTS Individual interviews with the pilots by news reporters disclosed the following information. Colonel Ozires Silva, president of the state oil company, Petrobras, the first to report the objects, was flying in a private plane near Sao Jose dos Campos. \"It wasn't like any of the classical flying objects seen in the movies,\" Silva said in a televised interview. \"It wasn't in the form of a flying saucer or plate. Instead, what I saw were illuminated points.\" An air force pilot confirmed on Friday he chased UFOs he described as pulsating, colored balls of light over the skies of southeastern Brazil early this week and said \"they couldn't be anything now existing.\" . Lt. Kleber Caldas Marinho, 25, said he pursued but could not catch the flying objects first sighted in the southeastern city of Sao Jose dos Campos on Monday night. \"It was a pulsating light, red and white, mostly white,\" Marinho said at a press Rio de Janeiro Sao Jose dpsiCarnpo Sao Pauli Where UFOs spotted conference at air force headquarters in the capital (Brasilia, Brazil). \"It was not a star. It couldn't have been another plane. It couldn't be any- thing now existing,\" he said. Marinho said his U.S. made F-5E fighter approached to within 12 miles of one of the objects, but had to turn back because he was running low on fuel. Capt. Marcio Jordao, 29, another F5-E pilot, said he saw-\"a red. light that didn't vary, but evidently was moving. I got to within 25 miles but I couldn't go any faster.\" He reported \"that visibility was great. There were no clouds or other air'traffic.\" • The objects were picked up on radar screens in three states in south- eastern Brazil, the air force said. Another pilot described the objects as \"the shape and size of a ping-pong ball fly ing at a speed of 840 mph\" TV G lobo, the country's leading news network reported on May 21st.

INTRODUCTION After maintaining a'low profile for a period of several years, UFOs have regained the.world headlines following an incident in Brazilian air space during the night of May 19, 1986. In spite-of the large amount of clippings received from UNJCAT correspondents in Brazil and Argentina, as well as reprints of news items that appeared in American newspapers, I find it difficult to organize the information in a coherent narrative. The different Brazilian newspapers and the statements of government officials provide somewhat contradictory versions of the events, but it is clear that something out of the ordinary occurred, enough to shake the complacency, of the authorities. EVENTS The night of May 19, 1986, a Monday, was clear and with good visibility, devoid of heavy clouds that could affect radar. An executive plane, a Brazilian- made, two-engine Xingu owned by EMBRAER • (Empresa . Brasilena de Aeronauta), was en route from Brasilia to Sao Jose dos Campos (near Sao Paulo). While starting its descent, it was alerted by the Sao Paulo radar control that an unknown object was in the area. The presence of this unknown was confirmed shortly by the radar at Brasilia (1). In the pilot seat of the Xingu was a well known man: Colonel Ospires Silva, former president of EMBRAER, who had just been appointed head of PETROBRAS, the Brazilian state- owned oil company. According to the official version, Col. Silva was the first to visually spot the unidentified object as a \"dancing point in the sky\" (2): The ATLANTIC OCEAN Santa Cruz AFB time was 21:10 (8). Next to Osires Silva was a civilian pilot for EMBRAER: Commander Alcir Pereira da Silva, age 37, with more than 6000 hours of flying time. In his statement to the press (l),Comm. Alcir Pereira da Silva indicated that when the Xingu had descended to 2000 ft., the pilots perceived a strong light and turned the plane in its direction. The light is described as \"brighter than a star, emitting a constant red-orange light\" and also as being on for 10-15 seconds, then off, only to reappear at a different location (1). Whatever the case was, the pilots were very soon discouraged and abandoned the chase after about 30 minutes. By that time, the Brazilian Defense Center (CINDACTA - Centre Integrado de Defesa Aerea e Controle de Trafego Aereo) which apparently controls all air traffic, was on full alert, as the radar screens in the vicinity of Sao dos Campos and nearby Sao Paulo were saturated arid all air traffic had been interrupted (2). Only minutes after the appearance of the unknown objects on the radar screens, jets were scrambled from' two Air Force bases (see map): Santa Cruz,' in the State of Sao Paulo, and Anapolis, near Brasilia. Although the number of jet fighters scrambled, as well as the number of UFOs that were detected is variable depending on the spokesman, the indisputable fact is that planes were dispatched, attempted to approach the lights, and failed. The UFOs had initially appeared over a mountainous region between the states of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, known as the Sierra de las Manchiqueira (2). The incident terminated near midnight as suddenly as it had started, with the UFO (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"OVNIS, Continued disappearing simultaneously from radar and from visual observation after moving toward the ocean beyond the Brazilian coast. The duration of the sighting was close to three hours. PILOT ACCOUNTS The Brazilian Air Force allowed the pilots to have a press conference in which they freely expressed their versions of the events of May 19.' According to our correspondent in Rio, Mrs. Irene Granchi, the 7 pilots and 3 radar controllers that participated in the incidents appeared on television (4). We 'summarize their statements from the information received from Mrs. Granchi, as well as from the version published by the prestigious newspaper O GLOBO (3). All of the seven pilots were military, except the already named Comm. Alcir Pereira da Silva. Three F-5E jets were scrambled from the Santa Cruz AFB near Sao Paulo, two of them in 22:23 and the third at 22:55. In addition, three Mirage III jet fighters were scrambled from the Anapolis AFB at-22:50 (8), but only one had an effective contact/The time of the actual contacts has been established as between 22:55 and 23:20 (8). The pilot of one of the F-5E's was Lt. Kleber Caldas Marinho, age 25. Following the instructions- of the radar controller, he vectored his plane to a .target 35 miles distant, but was unable to close in. The radar control in Brasilia informed him at this point that the target was approaching him rapidly. However, the pilot didn't see anything, and in his own words, \"one gets scared of what one sees, and I saw nothing.\" But later in the chase, he finally obtained a visual contact. As verified by both the ground radar and the on-board radar, the target was at a distance of 35 miles, but when the pilot tried to narrow the gap it was \"like attempting to reach a point at infinity,\" in spite of his 1000 km/hr (625 MPH) speed. As his fuel was getting low, he returned to the Santa Cruz Air Force Base (3). He described the target as a reddish light, very intense, which. changed colors when the chase was aborted, first to white, then to green and to red again (3). The pilot of the second F-5E, Capt. Marcio Jordao, age 29, was luckier, as he was able to reduce the distance to the target to 12 miles. He describes the UFO as a very strong light of continuous intensity, and changing colors continuously from white to green. Capt. Jordao broke up the contact when the object moved over the sea beyond the 200 mile limit from Santa Cruz (3).\" Of the three Mirages scrambled from the Anapolis Base, only one was able to establish actual contact. It was piloted by Capt. Armindo Souza Viriato de Freitas, age 30, whose statements we transcribe (4,8):' \"I was warned by ground control that there were several targets ahead of me, at a distance of 20 miles and ranging in number from 10 to 13. I was also advised that the targets were approaching my plane, and finally that they were following me at a distance of 2 miles (sic). I had to lower my plane, as the lights had descended, but from then on they climbed vertically. This was my only visual contact, but I could see them in my radar at a distance of 12 miles.\" The radar controller at the Anapolis AFB was Lt. Hugo'Nunes Freitas (notice similarity of names) and he advised Capt. Viriato that he had several targets behind his plane, six to one side and seven to the other. According to O GLOBO (3), Capt. Viriato added that the targets made 80 degree turns (possibly 180 degrees was meant) and that he could not manage to have a visual contact right ahead of his plane. \"No plane I know can make turns like that at 1000 Km/hr,\" he concluded. One of the traffic controllers, Ltn. Valdecir Fernando Coehlo, stated: \"In my 14 years of experience as a radar operator, I never' saw anything like this.\" ... Familiar, isn't it? At the close of the press meeting, and immediately following the pilots' reports, the Air Ministry declared that no further reports are to be expected on the incidents until the special commission appointed to investigate the events has reached a conclusion. AIR MINISTER Some unusual and out of character developments must be pointed out. The Air Minister, Brigadier Octavio Julio Moreira Lima, after informing the President of Brazil, Jose Sarney, of the incident, proceeded to inform the press that the radar screen of CINDACTA in Sao Paulo had been saturated, that jets had been scrambled, and'that visual- radar contacts had been established with \"balls of light bf multiple colors.\" This is the first time that a high- ranking officer of the air force of any nation has come forward'and admitted the presence of unidentified objects, and moreover, that intercept attempts had failed (2, 5). In addition, the Air Minister carried on his press conference in a semi- humorous tone, indicating that he \"always wanted to see a UFO as a child,\" but adding \"that radar is not subject to optical'illusions. The radar echoes are due to solid objects or to massive clouds, which were not present that-night.\" Strangely enough, the Air Minister Bdr. Moreira Lima did' not seem concerned about this unchecked penetration of the Brazilian air space, but was rather proud of the prompt response of the Air Force to an alert (7). According to CLARIN (2), the decision' to release the news to the public was made personally by : President Sarney, another first. CONCLUSIONS Although their number is uncertain, numerous UFOs were observed visually and detected by both ground 'and airborne radars. The episode lasted for nearly three hours, but the only concrete information is that they were\"balls of light of different and changing colors, which the jet fighters could not really approach. As in many other cases, the initiation and termination of the incident were sudden and unexpected. Weather was good, a clear night without clouds, so that radar echoes remain unexplained. The number of echoes was very' large, enough to saturate the radar screens and according to the Air Minister (continued on page 11)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"PROJECT MOON DUST By Barry J. Greenwood The following article is from \"Just Cause,\" edited by Barry Greenwood and published by Lawrence' Fawcett. Subscriptions (4 issues for $10) are available from Box 218, Coventry, Conn., 06238. In our last issue, we alluded to one of those many project code names which .turn up from time to time in released government documents. Few of these are ever identified in more, than brief detail. However, Project Moon Dust, as named in recently-released DIA files is an exception. We have several documents which do seem to link UFOs with this, colorfully named . project. Our thanks to Robert Toddfor providing us with, the background information' on his several-years-old research into Moon Dust. We have heard of stories, or more accurately, rumors, of crashed UFOs and alien bodies recovered. Dozens of them are presently on file. Often in these accounts, military personnel respond quickly to a developing situation, enact a carefully-planned set of procedures (like , photography, mapping, interviews, etc.); then, usually, the evidence is carted away to an unknown location for further study. That's what the rumors tell us. You must have thought at times, while digesting these rumors, that such step-by-step action must have been scripted; that there must have been guidelines to follow for everything to have been done so thoroughly and properly that not a stick of residue was left. You know how .the military does everything by the book, as they tell us! If all this is so, then these procedures must be available for consultation when needed. It's possible that we now have been pointed in the right direction to verify whether or not these procedures are on the record. Salted throughout some recent document releases, mainly from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and State Department, are references to \"Project Moon Dust.\" The context of this code name to the rest of the published data was unclear, but the fact that it . repeatedly turned up in documents dealing with .UFOs. told us that it was worth checking. A feeler was put into the March 1986 issue olJust Cause, requesting • that anyone who had knowledge of Project Moon Dust to. please contact us. o: .Not long afterwards, Robert Todd, a well-known CAUS researcher, informed us that he,had researched Moon Dust in the late 1970s. What he had found was quite revealing. EXTRACTS As a result of inquiries by Todd about Moon Dust, arid other matters, the Air Force released a letter on August 10, 1979. It was identified as \"AFCIN-1E-O,\" dated 3 November 1961. The letter was partly deleted, but enought was left to open the door on Moon Dust: (emphasis added where necessary--ed.) Extract, page 1: \"c. In addition to their staff duty assignments, intelligence team personnel have peacetime duty functions in support of such Air Force projects as Moondust, Bluefly, and UFO, and other AFCIN directed quick.reaction projects which require intelligence team operational capabilities (see Definitions).\" Extract, page 2: \"f. Blue Fly: Operation Blue Fly has been established to facilitate expeditious delivery to FTD of Moon Dust or other items of great technical intelligence interest. AFCIN SOP for Blue Fly operations, February 1960, provides for 1127th participation.\" \"g.

These three peacetime projects all involve a potential for employment of qualified field intelligence personnel on a quick reaction basis to recover or perform field exploitation of unidentified flying objects, or known Soviet/Bloc aerospace vehicles-, weapons .systems, and/or residual components of such equipment. The intelligence team capability to gain rapid access, regardless of location, to .recover or perform field exploitation, to communicate and provide intelligence reports is , the, only such collection capability available to AFCIN, and it. is vitally necessary in view of current intelligence gaps concerning Soviet/Bloc technological capabilities:\" IMPLICATIONS Let's pause a moment to absorb this. The letter immediately indicates that Moon Dust, \"Blue Fly,\" and: \"UFO\" are among A.F. Intelligence's quick reaction projects. It is probable here that \"UFO\" refers to Blue Book. We have pointed out in CLEAR INTENT (pg. 9) that often the prefix word \"Blue\" has been used in connection with high-altitude vehicles, and' it appears in several fact, and rumor, UFO projects. Here we see it again in \"Blue Fly,\" which provided for transportation of Moon Dust material. And what did Moon Dust material include? Among other things, it included things acquired from the (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MOON DUST, Continued recovery and/or field exploitation of UFOs! Note how UFOs are set apart from Soviet/Bloc aerospace vehicles. Since the Soviets were the only other real space power in the world at the time, besides the U.S., what could have been meant by setting off UFOs as a separate subject of investigation? If they were British, or another nation's space vehicle, why not say this, as it was said for the Soviets? Note that Moon Dust and \"other items of great .technical intelligence interest\" were -sent to the Foreign Technology Division at Wright- Patterson AFB in Ohio, under. Project Blue Fly. FTD was the parent group for Project Blue Book. Coincidence? Originally, .Blue Book's investigative functions were partly aided by personnel of the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron (AISS). Part of its mission during WW2, and later in peacetime,- .was to \"exploit downed people, paper and hardware\" for intelligence information. The 4602nd's operations were transferred to AFCIN in July 1957, .which then assigned the 1006th AISS most of the 4602nd's operations. The ,1006th was re-designated the 1127th Field Activities Group in 1960. These units all performed UFO investigations for Blue Book but were trained for and capable of additional activities in the event that one of these UFOs had crashed somewhere. We discuss the operations of a possible \"quick response unit\" in CLEAR INTENT, pg.' 111. Our point in that discussion was that such a unit would come under the highest security classification. Any admission that a UFO phenomenon- was real and unexplainable would not be in the government's best interest to state, considering the still-exis.tant debunking, policy. Certainly here we see UFO investigation linked to the highest levels of the U.S. Air Force. ORIGINS When did Moon Dust begin? We aren't sure but it likely dates from the beginning of Blue Book at least, i.e. the early 1950s. It's entirely possible that the 1952 crashed disc incident reported in letters by Rear Admiral Herbert Knowles (see Just Cause, March 1986) could have been investigated under' Moon Dust, if it were called that then. It certainly fits the criteria for attention, as described in the Air Force's 1961 letter. , Compelling evidence for the Moon Dust/crash retrieval link and its early origins appears in Donald Keyhoe's 1955 book, THE FLYING SAUCER ' CONSPIRACY. Note these extracts (pages 214-215): Two days after this Lou Corbin called me to report another development. \"Do you know anything about a 'crashed-object' program?\" he asked me.. \"No. Whose project is it?\" \"It's an Air Force deal, unless somebody's trying to trick me. You've heard of .the 4602nd Air Intelligence Service Squadron, of course?\" \"Yes. It's a hush-hush unit. They have, investigators in all Air Defense Squadrons:\" \"Well, I've been contacted by one of them. First I thought it might be some kind of hoax. But I've double-checked. He actually is with the 4602nd.\" \"Sounds queer, Lou. They're not supposed to talk to anyone outside of Intelligence.\"', \"I know. But he may be under special orders. Anyway, he's against the secrecy policy. He told me the 4602nd has a special program called the \"investigation of unidentified crashed objects.\" \"If it's true, that is big,\" I said. \"It could mean they've actually got their . hands on some flying saucers.\" \"He wouldn't admit that,\" said Corbin. \"But I got the impression they'd recovered some kind of 'objects'-- probably something dropped from a saucer.\" And from pages 231-232: At 2:00 PM on November 30 (1954?) a mysterious bright flash in the sky was reported simultaneously in Atlanta, Newman, and Columbus, Georgia; in Sylacauga and Birmingham, Alabama; and as far away as Greenville, Mississippi. This brilliant light was immediately followed by a series of strange explosions, apparently centered high in the sky above Sylacauga. Moments later a black object, six inches in diameter, crashed into the home of Mrs. Hewlett Hodges. Smashing a three-foot-wide hole in the roof, the shining black object tore through the living-room ceiling. Striking the radio, it bounced off and gashed Mrs. Hodges' arm. Meanwhile, the mysterious explosions had caused a hurried Air Defense alert. A three-state search for fallen objects was immediately begun by squadrons of Air Force planes. When word of the \"Sylacauga object'( reached the Air Force, Intelligence officers flew to the scene from Maxwell Air Force Base at Montgomery. Explaining that, \"the Air Force is required to examine such strange objects,\" they whisked it away to Maxwell Field, from which it was flown immediately to ATIC. An hour or two later the object was labeled a meteorite. As soon as,this appeared in the papers, I received a call from Lou Corbin. \"It's plain that this is part of the Air Force 'unidentified crashed- objects' investigation. They must believe the thing is linked with the saucers.\" \"It doesn't look like a coincidence,\" I said, \"that this object fell just after those explosions. If it had been a meteor exploding, it wouldn't have made such a bright flash in the daytime.\" \"In the first news story,\" Corbin told me, \"it was called an unidentified flying object. At least that's the way the Maxwell Field officers explained why they had started the search/' \"This reminds me of that East New Haven'signboard case,\" I commented. \"On that occasion the object wasn't recovered. Judging from the size of the hole it made, however, it was probably about the same size.\" MOON DUST DEAD? Later FOIA requests have indicated that the DIA is currently the responsible agency for Moon Dust documentation. However, access is not being allowed because such access (continued on page 14)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PETALUMA UFO By Tom D. Page Tom D. Page is MUFON's assistant state director for northern California. At least 12 witnesses in the Petaluma, • Calif, area reported an unusual configuration of lights in the early, morning sky on May 22, 1986 between 4 and 4:30 a.m. P.D.S.T. There was a full moon, a few low clouds and a light wind blowing towards the east. Since a few of the major witnesses were employed by news media institutions, the report instantly received widespread coverage from San Francisco to Santa Rosa, Calif. It was picked-up nationwide by Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UP), USA Today, Charles Osgood on the CBS-TV morning news and a feature by Cable Nets Network (CNN)..In addition, Mr. Page was interviewed live on KRON- TV Channel 4 in San Francisco. The sighting came on the heels of reports of multi-colored UFOs appearing on radar screens on May 19, 1986 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, which increased news media interest and exposure. If one accepted the media's description of the UFO, this is the impression one would have received: A glowing, orange \"X\" \" that darted around, hovered, moved backwards and changed speed from slow to fast. The media listed the main witnesses as Sue Hart and Wanda Madson, newspaper distributors for the Santa Rosa (CA) The Press Democrat, a California Highway Patrol Officer; and Ms. Arlette Cohen, news director for radio station KTOB-AM in Petaluma. Tom D. Page, science teacher and track coach at Novato's San Marin High School and a resident of Petaluma, immediately started interviewing these witnesses after returning home from a track meet in northern California. After interviewing the witnesses, whose descriptions were used by the 8 media, this is what the investigator and author learned. The newspaper distributors, Sue Hart and Wanda Madson saw the following: two white lights with a small red light in the middle and back from the other two. The object appeared to be hovering.The women were in a moving automobile with the windows closed. They estimated the altitude to be about 2,000 feet and the distance about one-fourth to maybe three-fourths of a mile. They were observing the object through the windows of the moving car. After \"popping\" newspapers into boxes on their route, they looked back a few minutes later and noticed that the object had disappeared. The time was a little after 4 a.m. Their location was on Station Hill Road, a few miles north of Sebastopol, Calif. HIGHWAY PATROL The next witness was the California Highway Patrol Officer who preferred that his name not be made public. (His name is on file with MUFON.) The officer was a passenger in a patrol car heading north on U.S. Highway 101 north of Petaluma. He observed an object moving slowly from the north to the south about } / 2 mile east of his position at about 1,500 to 2,000 feet altitude. The object had four white lights, one on the front, one on each side and one on the back. The officer thought the light configuration was unusual for an airplane. The C.H.P. officer stopped watching it after a minute because he felt \"it was not that unusual.\" A short time later the officer and his partner heard a report on their radio that someone had reported a UFO. At this time the officer's partner called their headquarters by radio to report that they may have seen the same object. The time of the observation was close to 4:30 a.m. The officer's partner, who was driving, did not see the object. . The third witness referred to by the media was Arlette Cohen, a radio station news director for KTOB. Arlette saw an object that at first she thought was crossing the highway, but later felt the movement of the object was due to the changing direction of U.S. Highway 101. She was driving north on U.S. 101 toward Petaluma to go to work. The object was moving slowly from north to south and was about 1,500 to 2,000 feet high. It had two white lights in the front and two white or green lights in the back. She could not make out the shape of the object, but thought the dark areas around the lights formed an X-shape. At the closest point, she slowed her Toyota automobile, turned down the volume on the radio and rolled down a window so she could listen for the sound of a helicopter or some other recognizable flying machine, but heard nothing. The time of this observation was about 4:30 a.m. Mr. Page has talked to witnesses wherein the route transversed was from Guerneville at 4:00 a.m., to Sebastopol at 4:15 a.m. and Petaluma at 4:30 a.m., which is from northwest to southeast. SIDE FACTORS I think it is important that all three witnesses quoted by the media in their stories were in moving cars at the time of the sighting. The car windows were rolled up, with the exception of Arlette, who rolled hers down. Arlette and the C.H.P. officer, when asked, could not state positively that what they saw was not an airplane or helicopter. Without stopping their cars and getting out to listen, I do not feel one can make an accurate evaluation about any sound that may or may not have been coming from the object. As an example: just recently my wife and I observed a (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PETALUMA, Continued circling helicopter hear one side of the road, at about 200 to 400 yards distance and maybe 800 to 1,000 feet in height. The car windows were closed, the radio was not turned on, and there was medium to heavy traffic on the highway. We tried but were unable to hear any sound coming from the helicopter. Arlette Cohen informed me that she felt she was mis-quoted in the Argus-Courier and the Marin Independent Journal newspaper articles. I talked to Chris Smith, staff writer for The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, Calif.), as he was writing his story, and informed him that what one witness, Miss Marti James and her sister saw Wednesday night was a star whose motion became apparent when it was near the western horizon. The story was already a part of the article with a photograph of Marti James so it was not removed. I have not found a witness who saw an orange X, and much of the hovering and darting seems not to be a part of my conversations with witnesses. The C.H.P. officer reported that the object was moving slowly and did say the lights appeared to be in the shape of an X. The radio news director was not sure if the object was hovering or moving slowly. She now wishes she had stopped her car and gotten out to observe the object better, but was already late for work and kept moving. Radio station KTOB in Petaluma, where Arlette works, is a local news, talk and music station. They talk about news in a personal way. When this sighting was mentioned on the air the news traveled quickly. Local papers, radio stations and television stations were quick to move on the story. It was interesting to note the very high level of interest in UFOs and to discover that the media people I talked with believe that they do exist. The California Highway Patrol office in this area received about 50 telephone calls from people just wanting to know about the object. (Editor's note: One of these calls to Santa Rosa CHP Officer Bill McChristian was made by Mrs. Jozaa D. Buist, a Field Investigator Trainee in San Diego, Calif., who conducted a telephone interview with Mr. McChristian.) It should also be noted that the C.H.P. officer did not report the object until they heard a report on their radio that a UFO sighting had been reported. Also, the newspaper distributors first reaction was that it was a UFO, however later one of them felt it could have been a helicopter. SUMMARY To provide a preliminary summation, I feel we have lights that appeared different from normal airplane lights and a slow moving object that at one or two times hovered. Its shape is uncertain and the object may have been a UFO or a helicopter. Because a radio station became involved (KTOB), the news of the sightings spread quickly and .media distortion of the sightings took place. But, even with that, a positive and high level of interest in the UFO phenomenon was made apparent by people in this area. . I am currently calling airports looking for one or more helicopters that may have been in the area at that time. One helicopter pilot told me that since the floods in February (1986) he has seen more helicopters in the area. As of June 4th, I have been unsuccessful in locating a helicopter in this area. If one is found the readers of the Journal will be informed. The author has just a \"hunch\" that the object may have been a .helicopter, but a UFO is also a possibility. NOTES Periphery information from other investigators and interesting notes are taken from newspaper articles by the Associate Editor Walt Aridrus. Paul Cerny, Western Regional Director, conducted a telephone interview with the C.H.P. officer who witnessed the reported UFO. The officer advised Paul that they had just conducted a security survey of the airplanes at the Petaluma Airport and were proceeding north on U.S. 101. He described the lights' configuration in the following manner: two large white lights on the front, two smaller white lights on each side, and one in the rear. It was flying slower than an airplane. He estimated the altitude of the object at 1,500 feet. Moving from north to south, it passed to the right of their patrol car. It was observed for one minute at approximately 4:30 a.m. The patrol car windows were closed and no sound was detected. Two large white lights and two smaller lights were also reported by Wanda Madson and Sue Hart in Sebastopol, Calif., to The Press Democrat. George Snyder, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, conducted some telephone interviews for his article published on May 23, 1986, related to the sightings. San Francisco Bay Area air traffic controllers said they could not explain the sightings, saying their radar screens detected no such object flying over the area at that time. . (Editor's note: If the object was at 1,500 to 2,000 feet altitude, at that distance, it would not have been detected.) At Beale Air Force Base, located about 50 miles north of Sacramento, a public relations officer said \"we have had some calls, but we know nothing about it.\" Robert Sheaffer, a member of the Bay Area Skeptics, a group that seeks to prevent UFO mythmaking, speculated that the object may have been an ultralight experimental aircraft. He cautioned that shifting air currents, darkness and optical illusions may have affected the witnesses' ability to hear or see clues that the UFO was a man- made aircraft of some sort. Dee Dee Long, co-owner of Ultralight Flight Inc. of Sebastopol, supplies ultralight aircraft used at Petaluma's Liberty Field, near where the sightings occurred. She said the law forbids such craft from flying more than half an hour before sunrise — which occurred just before 6 a.m. yesterday — and that they normally are not equipped with lights. The craft resemble motorized hang-gliders. Long added that the ultralights can fly slowly but cannot hover, and are easily heard from the ground when they fly at a height of 1,000 to 1,500 feet. An ultralight aircraft has an open cockpit and is built around a lightweight frame of aluminum tubing.

Spritely helicopter The unusual craft in the photo above may look like a combination flying saucer and helicopter, but it's actually a prototype for a remarkable piece of military hardware called SPRITE, for Surveillance, Patrol, Reconnaissance, Intelligence gathering, Target desig- nation, and Electronic warfare. SPRITE is one of a new breed of un- manned aircraft called RPHs, for Re- motely Piloted Helicopter. It combines the. vertical-takeoff-and-landing ad- vantages of a helicopter with those of the more conventional RPVs (Remotely Piloted Vehicles). Its twin counterro- tating blades eliminate the need for a tail rotor, make it stable in high wind gusts, a.nd allow the fuselage to rotate so that on-board cameras can be aimed in any direction without hav- ing to change flight path. It weighs just 80 pounds, and is powered by a pair of two-stroke engines. At the battlefield, SPRITE can. fly 10 up to 70 mph at altitudes up to 10,000 feet. It is radio-controlled by a two-man ground crew who monitors the craft and the TV pictures it sends back, the whole operation being managed from a vehicle such as the HMMWV [PS, June '82] or a Land Rover. Besides the obvious TV cameras With zoom lenses, SPRITE can carry a variety of other equipment in the pie-like, interchangeable modules that make up its fuselage. Such add-ons in- clude: infrared sensors, laser target designators for guided bombs and mis- siles, sniffers for detecting chemical warfare agents, and jammers for dis- rupting enemy communications. In civilian use, SPRITE could be used to inspect power lines and pipe- lines and conduct geological surveys. SPRITE was developed by the ML Aviation Co. in England, and should' be in production by 1990. -Popular Science SHORT PAPERS The MUFON 1987 INTER- NATIONAL UFO SYMPOSIUM will take place at the American University in; Washington, D.C. during the weekend of June 26, 27, and 28th! The host organization is the Fund, for UFO Research. In past years the annual MUFON symposium has featured invited speakers. In addition the 1987 symposium will introduce to MUFON a practice which is standard for scientific society symposia: the presentation of contributed papers. Contributed papers are short presentations (15 minutes long.with 5 minutes allowed for questions from the audience) for which . no formal full length paper is required. However, each contributed paper is .summarized in an abstract of less than 300 words. The abstracts are published in the symposium proceedings and are available, along with the invited papers, on the first day of the symposium. The symposium committee reserve the right to edit abstracts as appropriate. .- Several hours will be reserved on Saturday afternoon and Sunday, morning during which these papers will, be presented. The exact length of the contributed paper session will depend upon the number of papers submitted. If more than 12 papers (four hours worth of- 20 minute discussions) are submitted, then two or more presentation sessions may be run at the same time (\"parallel sessions\"). No more than 36 contributed papers will be accepted for a maximum of three parallel sessions. This is the first call for contributed papers. If less than a dozen abstracts are received by the first of November, a second call will be issued in December., Abstracts will not be accepted after February 15, 1987. The acceptance of a 'Contributed paper will depend upon the appropriateness of the subject matter"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"NEWS 'N' NEWS, Continued and upon the clarity of the discussion in the abstract. The abstract should be written to set the stage for the 15 minute verbal presentation. It should present key points and the author's conclusion. Appropriate subjects include history, case investigation, results of recent research, analysis of physical data (photography, radar, landing traces), analysis of explanations for sightings, sociology, psychological studies, medical studies of witnesses, government involvement, abduction reports, etc. Authors should keep in mind that, whereas it is possible to present key ideas and important conclusions in short presentations, it is not possible to discuss all aspects of a subject in depth. Therefore each paper should be limited in scope. The presentation should be clear and concise. The use of visual aides (slides, viewgraphs) is advised and references to other sources of related information should be given whenever possible. Contributors should be prepared to answer questions from the audience. Along with the abstract, each author should also provide a very brief biography or resume indicating academic credentials or experience in the field of UFO research. Each contributor of an accepted abstract is expected to attend the symposium (at his/her expense) to present the paper. The first 36 (or fewer) abstracts to be received and accepted will be published in the proceedings. In January (or in March if there is a second call for papers) each contributor will be notified as to whether or not their abstract has been accepted. Contributed papers should be mailed to Richard H. Hall, 4418 - 39th Street, Brentwood,' ME) 20722. As in the past, all invited speakers will submit their papers to Walt Andrus, 103 Oldtowne Road,' Seguin, TX 78155- 4099. UFOS, Continued \"It is not a question of believing or not,\" Brigadier General O.M. Lima said. \"This requires technical information, and we have neither replies nor technical explanations for what happened,\" Lima said. The Brazilian Air Force on Thursday, (May 22nd) named a panel to investigate the sightings. The Air Force Ministry summoned the pilots of three F-5E's and two Mirage-3's to Brasilia for interviews and investigation. .(Their press conference statements are reported above.) MORE SIGHTINGS More UFO sightings have been reported since the May 19th flurry according to Reuters. On Wednesday afternoon (May 21, 1986) the air force base in Fortaleza, capital of the northeastern state of Ceara, received numerous calls from residents about a dark, cigar-shaped object seen in the skies, the Jornal do Brasil said. Sonia Grumbach, a Rio Je Janerio witness, said she saw a bright light for 15 minutes that traveled at \"incredible velocity\" and\" seemed to jump (date not published). Brazilian television showed film of a glowing round object .that was alleged to have been photographed Thursday night (May 21st) by a freelance cameraman near Maringa in the southern state of Parana. Editor's . Note: MUFON is indebted to our members from coast to coast for submitting newspaper clippings on the' -Brazilian UFO sightings. This article would not have been possible without your help, since the San Antonio (Texas) Express- News published nothing. The San Antonio \"Light on May 24, 1986 published the Reuters follow-up. Bob Jamieson, Anchorman for NBC News at Sunrise, reported the event on May 22, 1986. OVNIS, Continued corresponded to solid targets. Nowhere in the original Brazilian newspaper clippings have I found a direct quote about the pingpong balls mentioned in the American press. CLARIN of Buenos Aires (2) states that the UFOs were described alternatively as stars, football balls, or pingpong balls. As for the speeds of the UFOs, only two specific quotes were made by the Brazilian press. The first refers to the statements made by Colonel Osires Silva, who is an aeronautical engineer by training/commenting on his attempt to approach the lights. He indicated that the maximum spped of his plane was 400 Km/hr (250 MPH), while the lights were apparently moving at a speed of 1500 Km/hr (937 MPH) (6). The second concrete mention of speeds was made by Major Ney Cerqueira, head of CINDACTA, who actively participated in the tracking operations. According to Maj. Cerqueira, \"due to technical limitations in the radar equipment\" the speeds could not be determined with precision.\" The speeds detected varied in an interval of 5 to 10 minutes from 150 Knots/hr to 800 Knots/hr\" (5). In miles perhour, this corresponds to a range of 173 to 921 MPH, and matches well with the information that jets with speeds of 1000 KM/hr (625 MPH) were unable to close on the lights. The sighting started, according to the Air Ministry, at 20:50 and ended about midnight, having thus a total duration of 3 hours (8). Finally, the number of UFOs has been quoted by the media as between 13 and 21. The Air Minister placed the number at 20 (7). Since most of the information, on which this report is based was obtained from newspaper clippings, usually a very unreliable source, it is necessary to emphasize that in this particular instance the media did a very faithful reporting job. Most of the details were released at the press conference in which the pilots related their experiences and were directly questioned by the reporters. The information written in the different papers is consistent/and accurate. In addition, the Air Ministry released information as a chronology of the events (8). All together, then, we,are satisfied that the incident occurred as narrated.

Rainier, Washington, reported nine, silvery, crescent-shaped objects skimming through the atmosphere at a high rate of speed. Their motion, Arnold said, reminded him of \"a saucer skipping over water.\" An alert AP reporter picked up the description and the phrase \"flying saucers\" was soon emblazoned in the Cold War consciousness between the Atom Bomb and the Iron Curtain, where it has remained ever since. Arnold's solo sighting proved to be the snowball that launched an avalanche. Reports of similar mysterious flying objects poured in from both coasts and numerous points in between. The unenviable task of investigating such reports fell logically within the province of the nascent U.S. Air Force. What were these Unidentified Flying Objects, or UFOs? Were they of extraterrestrial origin, or the product of advanced Soviet science, derived in turn from captured Nazi rocket technology? PROJECT SIGN In response to such questions, on December 30, 1947, Major General L.C. Craigie ordered the establishment of Project Sign at what became known as Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Operating under auspices of the Air Materiel Command's Technical Intelligence Division, Project Sign was directed \"to 12 collect, collate, evaluate and distribute to interested government agencies and contractors all information concerning sightings and phenomena in the atmosphere which can be construed to be of concern to the national security.\" The project was given a 2A restricted classification security rating under a system which acknowledged 1A as the highest, or most secret, designation. HYNEK In the spring of the following year, three men from Wright-Patterson approached Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer then employed by Ohio State University in nearby Columbus. As Hynek recently recalled, \"They said they needed some astronomical consultation because it was their job to find out what these flying saucer stories were all about.\" Hynek hired on as a consultant with the Air Force and remained in that capacity for over two decades as Sign evolved into Project Grudge and Blue Book, the last ceasing official operation in December of 1969. \"What the hell,\" added Hynek, \"It sounded like fun, and besides, I would be getting a top secret clearance out of it, too.\" Hynek also got an insight into the way the Air Force tried to handle the growing UFO problem, or at least the increasing frequency of UFO reports. \"I think their greatest mistake in the early days,\" said Hynek, \"was not turning it over to the universities or some academic group. They regarded it as an intelligence matter and it became increasingly more and more embarrassing for them to say 'Yes, there's something up there, but we're helpless.' They just couldn't do that, so they took the very human action of protecting their own interests. What they said was that we solved 96 per cent of the cases, and that we could have solved the other four per cent if we had just tried hard enough.\" It was Hynek's own experience of the Air Force's resolve to explain away all UFO sightings,.no matter what the cost to their .own credibility, that converted the astronomer from, his initial position as a skeptic to that of the . founder of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), and the author of several pro UFO phenomenon books,, including. \"The UFO Experience.\" Hynek not only, coined the phrase, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" but served as technical consultant for the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name. EXPLANATIONS In 1948, however, Hynek's duty was to dismiss as many UFO reports to misidentified astronomical phenomena as he could. The bright planet Venus quickly became a major culprit. But other sightings were not so .easily discredited and a minority of military personnel took these .seriously. Minority intelligence opinion then divided into the .two camps already mentioned, namely, those who saw UFOs as evidence of new Soviet technology, and those who thought they might be harbingers of an invasion by extraterrestrials. The concerns of those who viewed UFOs in terms of a Soviet breakthrough were detailed in a curious \"Top Secret\" government document only declassified as recently as March 5, 1985. This document is \"Air Intelligence Report No. 100-203-79,\" which was titled \"Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S.,\" and compiled under the joint direction of the Directorate of Intelligence (Air Force) and Office of Navy Intelligence. On the front cover of the 26-page paper was the following proviso: \"WARNING: This document (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CIA, Continued contains information affecting the national defense of the United States within the meaning of the espionage Act, 50 U.S.C., 31 and 32, as amended. Its transmission or the revelation of its contents in any manner to an unauthorized person is prohibited by law. Reproduction of the intelligence of this publication, under the provisions of Army Regulation 380-5, is authorized for United State military agencies provided the source is indicated.\" The cover was stamped \"Top Secret\" at both top and bottom. SOVIET SAUCERS If UFOs u;ere of Soviet origin, the authors of the document theorized, their presence over the United States could be tied to Russian interests as follows: \"a) To negate U.S. confidence in the atom bomb as the most advanced and decisive weapon in warfare, b.) To perform photographic reconnaisance missions, c.) To test U.S. air defenses, d.) To conduct familiarization flights over U.S. territory.\" Though the emerging tendency was to discredit a Soviet flying saucer, the possibility continued to be seriously examined until the early 1950s, and may have, in fact, subsequently discolored official government policy toward the UFO phenomenon for the next four decades and down to the present day. The evidence for thinking so comes from a prestigious UFO panel convened on January 14, 1953, by the Central Intelligence Agency, a confab that came to be known as the Robertson Panel, after its Chairman Dr. H.P. Robertson, then Director for the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and also a CIA employee. The sequence of events leading directly to the Robertson Panel involved a series of UFO sightings over the nation's capitol in the summer of 1952, sightings confirmed by military personnel, including radar operations and scrambled interceptor pilots, and which themselves resulted in the largest post WWII military press conference to that date. At the press conference itself, the repeated radar sightings were put down to \"temperature inversions,\" and no mention of the scrambled jet fighters was made by attending Air Force officers. CIA The Panel became public knowledge a few years later with the publication of \"The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects\" by Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, former commander of Project Blue Book. When queried as recently as 1976, in a Freedom of Information Act request filed by William Spaulding of the Phoenix, . Arizona-based Ground Saucer Watch, the CIA maintained that the Robertson Panel had been its one and only involvement with the subject of UFOS: \"In order that you may be aware (the CIA replied to Spaulding) of the true facts concerning the involvement of the CIA in the investigation of UFO phenomena, let me give you the following brief history. Late in 1952, the National Security Council levied upon the CIA the requirement to determine if the existence of UFOs would create a danger to the national security of the United States. The Office of Scientific Intelligence established the Intelligence Advisory Committee to study the matter. The committee made the recommendations found at the bottom of page 1 and the top four lines on page 2 of the Robertson Panel Report. At no time prior to the formation of the Robertson Panel and subsequent to the issuance of the panel's report, has the CIA engaged in the study of the UFO phenomenon. The Robertson Panel Report is summation of the Agency's interest and involvement in this matter.\" However, as, detailed in \"Clear Intent: The Government Cover-Up of the UFO Experience,\" by Barry Greenwood and Lawrence Fawcett, now in its second printing from Prentice-Hall, following a lengthy legal battle the CIA subsequently released nearly 900 pages of UFO-related documments, several of which were prior to the Robertson Report, but the majority of which came afterwards. Although fascinating in their own right, along with similar documents released by the FBI and various other intelligence gathering agencies, both civil and military, what concerns us here is the Robertson Panel itself and the tone it established for future government policy toward UFOs. ROBERTSON PANEL Besides the esteemed Dr. Robertson, the Panel also included as members physicist Dr. Luis Alvarez, later a Nobel Laureate, Dr. Samuel Goudsmit, another physicist from Brookhaven National Laboratories who was an assoicate of Einstein's and had discovered electron spin, a former University of Chicago astronomer and then Deputy Director of the John Hopkins Operations Research office, Dr. Thornton Page, and finally Dr. Lloyd Berkner, yet another physicist and one of Brookhaven's directors. As far as scientific credentials were concerned, .the CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel came armed to the teeth and gums. Certainly the presence of such intellectual luminaries on the Panel indicated that everyone involved, the CIA included, was taking the subject matter as of the most pressing importance. BRIEFINGS Both Ruppelt and Hynek sat in on certain sessions, but as advisors or lecturers, not official members of the Panel. Ruppelt described Blue Book's methodology, while Hynek reported on an ongoing UFO statistical study then being conducted by the Battelle Memorial Institute, one of the nation's more prestigious 'think tanks.' The Panel was also addressed by other CIA and Air Force personnel who reviewed some 20 of the better UFO cases and showed 2 film strips of alleged flying saucers, one of which purportedly portrayed objects characterized as \"self-luminous\" by no less an authoritative source than the Navy's Photograph Interpretation Laboratory which had spent over 1000 hours analyzing the particular movie film in question. Yet for all their scientific expertise, (continued next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CIA, Continued when it came time to pass along their recommendations, this panel of physicists and other distinguished scientists had its -greatest impact .in areas which had nothing to do with' hardcore data collection and processing, but referred instead to matters of national security which fell more under the domain of 'soft' disciplines, like psychology and sociology. FINDINGS In short, the Robertson Panel ruled \"That , the evidence presented on Unidentified Flying Objects shows no indication that these phenomena constitute a direct (my emphasis - author) physical, threat to national .security.\" So UFOs as the vanguard of an extraterrestrial invasion fleet were ruled out. And even though this ruling is still considered in contention by some contemporary UFO researchers, it was the Panel's second conclusion that forever frame it in notoriety, for while Robertson et al decreed no national security.threat from the UFO phenomenon itself, its members did see a real and distinct danger posed by UFO reports/ In the Panel's own words, it c.oncluded \"That the continued emphasis on the reporting of these phenomena, in these perilous times, result in a threat to the orderly functioning of the protective organs of the body politic.\" To paraphrase Churchill, the CIA.sponsored Robertson Report was telling the government (and military) that we had nothing to fear but fear itself. By way of modern analogy, imagine a top level conclave of the American Medical Association telling its members they had more to fear from reports of AIDS, than from the actual disease. The body politic's immune system, then, was being readied not to ward off malicious UFO microbes, but the very idea of such microbes. \"We cite as examples (of such danger),\" the Panel continued, \"the clogging of channels of communication by irrevelant reports, the danger of being led by continued false alarms to 14 ignore real indications,of hostile action, . and.the cultivation of a morbid (my emphasis -.author) national psychology in which skillful hostile propaganda could induce hysterical behavior and harmful distrust of. duly constituted authority (my emphasis again).\" In layman's terms, UFO reports constituted .a potential soft spot in the collective' national consciousness which might be subject to rrianipulaton by the Soviets. RECOMMENDATIONS \"In order,\" the Report .went on, \"most effectively to. strengthen the national facilities for the timely recognition and the appropriate handling of true indications.of hostile action, and to minimize .the concomitant dangers alluded, to above, the Panel recommends: a. That the national security agencies take immediate steps to strip •the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special status they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately (sic) acquired; b. That the national security agencies institute policies on intelligence, training, . and public education designed to prepare the material defenses and the morale of the country to recognize most promptly^ and to react most effectively to true indications of hostile intent or action.\" In one fell swoop, then, UFOs were shunted aside as a potential scientific conundrum, or area of investigation, and relegated instead to another contentious Cold War datum, one which might be deftly manipulated by our enemies. What's more, a distinguished panel that was supposed to rule on the scientific validity of the subject also found itself engaged in a crude psychological attempt at programming the public conscious- ness. . ©.1986 Dennis Stacy MOON DUST, Continued would reveal intelligence methods and are thus exempt from FOIA. NASA has been involved as well, as this extract from a Jan. 13, 1969, memo indicates: \"The undersigned (Richard M. Schulherr) visited the Foreign Technology Division of,the Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, 9 Jan. 1969. The purpose of this trip was to identify specific items of space debris which.had been forwarded to'NASA.and to re-establish personal liason ' with newly assigned FTD Moondust personnel.\" , The Air Force's Moon Dust ' activity, as well as Blue Fly, is, in their words \"no longer active.\" Perhaps the projects no longer go by these names but'surely the procedures have not become obsolete. There is still a need to react to unknown vehicles landing on our soil. At the very least, national defense is served by such reaction. One last thought. Could an MJ12- type committee have begun Moon Dust as a reaction to early UFO events like Roswell? It would be of interest to see exactly when Moon Dust began its operations.

By Hilary Evans Hilary Evans, editor and author, is the publications officer of the Association for the Scientific study of Anomalous Phenomena (ASSAP), England. This paper was the opening address at the Fourth Annual Franco-English UFO Colloquium, Brighton, in March of this year. Mr. Evans lives in London. His most recent book is \"Visions, Apparitions, Aliens Visitors\" (Aquarian Press). He was also recently awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Ufology from the fictional University of South Texas in Utopia. In 1969, you will remember, there was published a book entitled The Scientific Study of UFOs. Evidently at that time there was somebody around who felt there was at least a case for thinking UFOs deserve scientific study. However, as you will also remember, the conclusion of that book — or, at any rate, of the eminent scientist who headed the team which carried out the project which gathered the material which comprised the book — was that, taking everything into account, there was no case for believing that UFOs deserve scientific study. Briefly: scientists didn't need ufologists. As a result, any scientist who might hitherto have been wondering about UFOs now stopped wondering about them, and went back to the more urgent job of pursuing his career. However, the effect on the ufologists was different. They disputed the referee's decision; they claimed foul play; they began lobbying for a return match. Some of them even started talking about ufology as though it was a science in its own right. At this point in the discussion, it is customary for those taking part to produce the axioms of Kuhn, Truzzi, Popper and suchlike, and to bat them around the conference room like shuttlecocks. However, we can cut short any tendency to get lost wondering in philosophical circles by acknowledging one certainty: if there's one thing that Kuhn & Truzzi & Popper & all would all agree on, it is that, as things stand, ufology does not qualify as a science in its own right. SCIENTIFIC MERIT However, even if UFOs don't constitute a science in their own right, it remains true that some aspects of ufology may still merit scientific study. It can reasonably be argued that anything to which the scientific method can be applied can — to that extent — be termed a science. And clearly there are some aspects of ufology to which the scientific method.can be applied. Balls of. light, for one; and witness misperception for another. However, it seems likely that these aspects of ufology are precisely those which fall within the hunting rights of one or another science which already exists. Balls of light, for one, could reasonably be claimed by the' meteorologists, and witness misperception, for another, has already been tagged by the psychologists. So even if we were to succeed in getting a Professor of Ufology installed at the University of South Texas at Utopia, chances are he would spend his time disputing property which arguably belongs to others of his colleagues on the faculty. Ah, but note the plural 'others'! OK, we accept the interfaces with meteorology and with psychology. But what makes a UFO event so special is that it can contain elements which may well pertain to meteorology — that ball of light — but also to psychology: because the witness who reported that ball of light, a seemingly sincere and sensible character, . reported it as displaying signs of intelligence. Consequently, UFOs should be of the greatest interest to 1) any meteorologist who is exploring the psychological boundaries of his subject; and/or 2) any psychologist who is investigating meteorological influences on human behavior. . Fine; now all we have to do is find one or the other. FENCE HOPPING Today we live in a world of specialist sciences. A hundred years ago there lived a race of'beings who called themselves 'men of science' and occasionally 'women of science'. But the massive growth of science meant that the sheer burden of carrying around such a weight of knowledge became too much for .them, so to spread the load they separated into physicists and chemists and so on. Today, event those categories are too wide; when your hostess leads you up to a scientist at a cocktail party, it's not to Dr. This the chemist, but the enzyme chemist, not Professor That the physicist, but the particle physicist. And give Messrs This & That, half a chance, they'll go into minute detail to fill you in on their specialty... And if you were to take a look at their careers, you would find that each of them, having marked out a little field for himself, and set up a neat little fence around it, is far too busy to look over that fence to see what his neighbor is doing on the other side; nor does he welcome curiosity from others until he has consolidated his claim by publishing a learned paper in a learned journal... Well now, ask yourself, what has ufology got that would tempt a meteorologist or a psychologist to look up from his on-going project? Nothing! Nothing that will enable him to write the paper which will earn him the credit which will win him security of tenure at the University of South Texas at Utopia.

The following case is a textbook example of how a UFO investigation should be conducted as outlined in the MUFON FIELD INVESTIGAT- OR'S MANUAL and should be studied as such. BACKGROUND This IFO episode should prove instructive to UFO investigators for a number of reasons. First of all, the writer/investigator himself happened to be an eyewitness to the event. Second, the objects, initially unidentified, were merely point sources without extended diameters, surface detail, or erratic motion. Long ago I coined a term for such nonerratic sources — DLs- \"Damned Lights\" — because they are distant, provide little useful'data, and often turn out to be IFOs. Third, this report illustrates how absolutely necessary it is to stubbornly pursue all possible avenues in an effort to account for the sighting in terms of known conventional or known unusual phenomena. THE SIGHTING I was returning home to Massachusetts from a Florida vacation trip on Delta Air Lines Flight 594, Fort Lauderdale to Boston. My seat location was 39F next to the starboard window behind the wing. The 757's 4:10 p.m. takeoff had been delayed nearly an hour due to an announced \"air traffic control\" delay in Boston. As the aircraft flew northeastward up the Atlantic Coast, I happened to be reading the MUFON UFO Journal. Upon seeing this, the passenger next to me struck up a conversation with me about UFOs. Then I returned to my reading. A solid overcast covered much of the Northeast; rain and snow showers 16 were forecast for the region. The airliner flew above the cloud deck in clear skies at 41,000 feet. The sun had set at about 6:30 (New York City). Once in a while I glanced out the window to check sky conditions as the sky darkened to midtwilight. Not long after the Delta airliner started its descent over Long Island for landing at Boston's Logan International Airport (21 minutes from touchdown), I happened to look out the window again and spotted an intense deep amber (orange-yellow) light source, perhaps as bright, as Venus, oh top of the flat cloud deck almost directly below the plane. . My quick initial reaction was that I was seeing a ground light of some kind through a temporary break in the clouds. But then I realized that the overcast was solid and the light source was located near the top of the clouds and too high to be connected with any structure on the ground. The bright point source illuminated radically a circular region of clouds surrounding it. Occasionally cloud wisps passed over it, causing the source to dim slightly and flicker erratically. I had the impression that the source was either stationary or moving very slowly, although actually I had no way of knowing since the airliner itself was in motion and the light's distance was unknown. (If I were to hazard a guess at its range below the plane, I would have said possibly a mile or less.) Looking more closely, I discovered about four smaller and fainter lights of the same amber color arrayed in a tight arc not far from the main source but not concentric with it. I called my neighbor's attention to the phenomena. Without my prompting him as to what I observed, George Tobin, 24, manager of My Store, Inc., in Dedham, Massachusetts, leaned over and described seeing the same bright source and four smaller ones nearby. As our aircraft moved ahead of the lights, I continued to watch them as they drifted to the rear. Although the clouds obscured them more and more, I could still see the illuminated clouds around the bright source; the clouds caused the light to flicker irregularly. Finally it passed out of sight beyond my window. 'Midway through the observation, I read my digital watch. The time was 7:16. Based upon later reenactments with my watch, I estimated that my sighting may have lasted for up to 60 seconds. Immediately after, I had Tobin draw what he had seen and asked him how long he thought he had watched the lights. He estimated (rather precisely!) \"about 17 seconds.\" Shortly the 757 descended through the overcast and emerged with the lights of what I took to be Providence appearing to the right. I noted that the color of sodium-vapor lamps on the ground somewhat resembled the hue of the unidentified lights I had seen. Flight 594 touched down in Boston at 7:37. The sky was still overcast; the temperature was in the low 40s; and the runways showed signs of the showers that had fallen sporadically during the day. I hurriedly obtained Tobin's telephone number and home address in Norwood (he lived only four miles from my house). Waiting for. most of the passengers to leave, I approached one of the crew members, possibly the pilot. T asked him if he or any of the crew had spotted the lights shortly after the start of the descent. He asserted that no one had but they were \"apt to be pretty busy anyway\" at that point making preparations for landing. A number of twists of fate conspired to permit this observation: (1) On my trip to Florida I had asked for a starboard window seat so I could view (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"SIGHTING, Continued the coast by daylight. A similar right window seat was 'automatically assigned on my return flight boarding pass. I had neglected to specify a left window seat so as to again view the coast on the northbound trip. I had intended to request a change from right to left seats but simply forgot to do so; (2) if my return flight had not been delayed, I would have landed at Logan about 6:52, thereby in all probability missing the unidentifieds; (3) if I had not glanced out when I had, I would have missed the objects. INVESTIGATIVE DIARY A number of candidate IFOs had to be checked before a final UFO classification could be assinged to the episode. Foremost among them were a . flare drop, night aerial refueling operation, weather balloons with suspended lights, and ball lightning. Also I wanted to establish the cloud height, position and altitude of my aircraft, and if possible independent visual and/or radar confirmation of the sighting. April 11-Called the National Weather Service at Boston. To obtain cloud conditions at a point nearest the aircraft, the spokesperson kindly telephoned Providence while I remained on the line and then relayed the following to rife: Clouds ' were scattered at 3,500 feet, overcast at 4,500, and \"layered\" to 30,000. April 13--Called UFO investigator Ray Fowler of Wenham, who is familiar with flare drops and night aerial refueling missions. After hearing my description of the sighting, he commented that the objects did not resemble either. From his examination of the Cape Ann sightings of August 2, 1967,' Ray stated that the yellowish flares which were dropped in a series blinked out one by one and were not visible simultaneously. As a further check, he suggested that I telephone Public Affairs, FAA New England Region Headquarters, Boston, and the Watch Supervisor and Military Coordinator at the FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center, Nashua, New Hampshire. April 15-Called the FAA Public Affairs office in Boston and spoke with Mike Ciccarelli. After listening to my story, he released the telephone number arid a contact at the nearest FAA radar facility to my track — Quonset State . Airport, North Kingstown, Rhode Island — and the name of the Nashua Center Manager. April 15--Spoke with Bob Viera, Evening Shift Supervisor at , the Quonset radar facility. After checking the logs for the date and' time in question, Viera found no entry at all between 4 p.m. and midnight. . As sometimes happens during a UFO investigation, other sightings turn up. Viera said he was on duty last year when a Warwick, Rhode Island, doctor and his wife, flying from Providence to Block Island, encountered a UFO, complete with \"bubble-top\" and portholes. It circled the private plane and then sped off at an estimated 1,000 miles per hour! Apparently the physician radioed a number of radar stations, including Quonset, to seek confirmation. Viera recalled' that his radar showed the plane but no UFO. He gave the witness the' telephone number of Bob Cribble's National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle. Viera offered to search his logs and call me with the man's name. April 16-Called the FAA Air Route Traffic Control Center at Nashua. The center's jurisdiction covers most of New England. Since the Manager was not in, I talked with Mr. Murphy, the Watch Supervisor. Murphy told me he was on duty that evening (April 10), and there were no unusual visual or radar reports form anyone — pilots, ground personnel, or the Air .Defense Command. He emphasized that the military would have had to alert him through the center's Military Coordinator in case of flare drops or other military exercises along the airline route. He appeared puzzled by my sighting and offered Cribble's telephone number if I wished to make a UFO report. April 16--Called Delta Air Lines in East Boston to inquire about how I could contact the pilot of Flight 594. A spokesperson advised that I should write Boston Chief Pilot Jim Baker, who would relay my message to the pilot. April 28-Chief Pilot Baker called me in response to my letter, stating that the pilot of my flight was based in Atlanta. Baker promised to forward my letter to the Atlanta Chief Pilot. (I never received a response from Atlanta.) We talked at some length about what the objects might have been. I asked Baker for Delta's normal course and magnetic heading toward Providence. He kindly consulted his charts and passed on detailed course information. The aircraft would have passed over The Hamptons on Long Island. In determining my altitude, Baker pointed out that FAA regulations instruct airline pilots to be at 25,000 feet at a point 55 miles southwest of Providence (over Long Island Sound). This could indicate that the light sources were at an altitude of roughly 20,000 feet. The cloud layer below the airliner appeared to be stratiform, possibly altostratus, and the latter height would be about right for that cloud type. May 14--CalIed the new Computer UFO Network (CUFON) in.Seattle, which ; is affiliated with the National UFO Reporting Center .there. CUFQN receives UFO sighting reports from around the country. However, none were reported on the date of my sighting. May 17--Called the Coast Guard in Boston and spoke with Lieutenant Viekman, Search and Rescue Controller, in connection with possible flare drops in his district which he said extends south to Watch Hill, Rhode Island (not far from Long Island Sound). Viekman replied that no rescue drops occurred from April 8 to 12. But in addition, he said, Coast Guard aircraft flares are dropped from very low altitudes of 500 feet or less. May 17--Sudden|y realizing that Long Island Sound lay in a probably fringe area between FAA jurisdiction in New England and New York, I telephoned the Nashua Center again and obtained from the Watch Supervisor, Mr. Ferrie; the number of the FAA regional center at Islip, New York.   :••'•'• May 22--Called the Islip Center and spoke with Peter Lutz, Flight Data (continued next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"SIGHTING, Continued Clerk. When asked if any anomalous visual or radar reports or military flare drops had occurred on the date and time in question, he stated only that the .dates, times, and details of military, operations could not be given put to the public. Lutz volunteered, however, that there are naval bombing runs on an uninhabited island near Block Island which at night are preceded by flare drops in order to illuminate the target. He obviously wanted to help and decided to connect me with Ed Ryan, Assistant Manager of Quality Assurance. Ryan, in turn, said he would contact military source's for more information and call me.back. May,23-.-This case is solved to my satisfaction! Ed Ryan called and , cautiously told me that on the date and time in question a military operation was in progress in .the warning area on the southern portion of Long Island.. The exercise began at 7:00 p.m. and continued six hours until 1:00 .a.m. It •took place \"at 15,000 feet and below,\" and the operation \"may or may not\" have included flares. He said the exercise would have been to the right (southeast) of my aircraft. Beyond that, he could comment no further. Of all the candidate explanations for my sightings, flares remained at the top of the list. I recognized that it would be extremely difficult to get a positive confirmation of a flare drop not knowing which telephones to' call, which military base might be conducting such a mission, or whether officials would 'even admit to such an exercise. Allan Hendry, in The UFO Handbook, states: ' \"Unless the local air force base or Air National Guard indicates that it performed an exercise involving the use of flares, getting a 100 per cent confident identification can be nearly impossible...\" 2 Ryan's information was as close to a confirmation of a flare drop as I would get, even though an official admission of the use of flares was not forthcoming. However, the time, altitude, and direction of the exercise matched my sighting parameters, and the lights that I witnessed behaved somewhat like aircraft parachute flares. The aircraft 18 responsible for the release could have been, in the clouds, or on the other side of the airliner during the sighting. The magnesium/sodium nitrate flares that are dropped from military aircraft descend slowly on parachutes. They, can be released at 20,000 feet or more. The best description that I have found comes from . Ray Fowler's .chapter '.'Phenomena Commonly Reported as UFOs,\" in the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual: \"More than one are usually dropped over the ocean or a military gunnery range and appear as a string of lights appearing and disappearing. in 'sequence as each flare sequentially ignites and burns out one at a time. This type of flare has a rating of 2,000,000 candle'power and a burning time.of about 3 minutes. 'It falls at a rate of 450 feet per [minute] with its chute open aria 1 can be 1 seen from a great.distance (50 miles plus) depending upon aircraft height arid atmospheric conditions. At close distances (1-2 miles) the. light emitted is brilliant white. As the distance increases, the flare appears more yellow. At greater distances, the flares appear .yellowish-red. The impression sometimes given is that of a- forward moving circular craft with rotating lights around its perimeter.\"? NOTES 1. Raymond E.

For him to put his name to such a paper would be to condemn himself to remain in Outer Darkness throughout the rest of his career.. Well, Outer Darkness is a region we ufologists know well. It's where we've been working~all our ufological lives, without' security of tenure,- without research funding, without cash' or credit or fame or fortune. And yet it's here, if anywhere, that we shall find our . meteo-psychbigists and our psycho- meteorologists. NEED FOR SCIENTISTS? It goes without saying that ufology would benefit from science's research facilities, from the opportunities it •provides, for full-time involvement instead of the evenings and weekends which are all most of us have to spare. We could make good use of its research funds', its sophisticated equipment, its technical skills. And we could make excellent' use of its authority; it would make our Job a lot easier if we. could overawe a hesitant witness by reminding him we hold a Professorship of Ufology at'the University'of South Texas, Utopia... ,  • But. apart from these trappings, do we need the scientists themselves? If there were .free-range scientists like.in , .the old daysvyes indeed; but not today's fenced-itvand-glad-of-it variety. Of course, we have the occasional Persinger or Rutledge who's willing to take a wider view;. but they are outnumbered by thousands to one by those who sneer that finding connections between meteorology.and psychology is crazy enough, without dragging in,UFOs as evidence.. 1 don't suppose there's one of. us who hasn't at one time considered the possibility that he or she may,.\"be deluded. But the fact that I'm writing this article and. you're reading it suggests that, having considered that; possibility, we have'rejected it. But how, then, do we answer the question raised by my title? If the scientists can find nothing of value in .. what we have to offer them, and if they can't be of any help to us in our work, what is to be done? We have two alternatives. We can sit back and wait for the scientists to think again — but then, think how long- the parapsycholpgists have been waiting for the same thing! Or we can create the scientists ourselves. Which is the same as saying, we must ourselves become the new kind of scientists which the new kind of data demand."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued THE NIGHT SKY of the 1985-86 award for his work.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant SEPTEMBER 1986 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus approaches maxium brilliance (magnitude -4.6) at month's end (October 1), and it is possible around this time to look for it in broad daylight. On the 7th our nearest planet neighbor lies very close to the lunar crescent. On that date find the Moon 45° to the upper left of the Sun before sunset and then look for a tiny pinpoint (Venus) nearby. At dusk the bright planet is very low in the SW, setting about 1% hours after the Sun in midmonth. Mars, in Sagittarius, remains bright at magnitude -1.3 but is fading. The ruddy world stands in the SSE at dusk. Jupiter, moving eastward in Aquarius, reaches a point opposite the Sun on September 10. At that time it rises in the east at sunset and remains visible all night. The giant planet is at its brightest (magnitude -2.9) and nearest since 1975. Saturn, near reddish Antares in Scorpius (the planet is yellower and brighter than the star), lies in the SW at dusk and sets about 10 PM Daylight Time in midmonth. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars sets in the SW about 12:45 AM in mid-September. Jupiter sets in the west about sunrise (on the 10th). At dawn on the 17th it is just above the nearly full Moon. Moon Phases: New moon-September 4 First quarter-September 11 Full moon-September 18 (Harvest Moon) Last quarter-September 25 The Stars: € O Even though autumn in the Northern Hemisphere arrives officially September 23, the Summer Triangle maintains its lofty position high in the south during midevening hours. The upside-down Flying Horse Pegasus, which includes the Great Square, rises higher in the SE, while Scorpius disappears in the SW. In the north the Big Dipper descends toward the horizon. The hazy band of the Milky Way now passes overhead at midnorthern latitudes for its finest evening viewing of the year. Be aware of the following midevening bright stars and planets low enough in the sky to be subject to refraction effects and therefore false UFO reports: Arcturus (in WNW), Saturn and Antares (WSW), Mars (SSW), Fomalhaut and Jupiter (SE), and Capella (NE). 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus The MUFON 1987 International UFO Symposium will be held on the weekend of June 26, 27, and 28 at the American University in Washington, D.C. Hosted by the Fund for UFO Research, it will be spearheaded by Bruce S. Maccabce, Chairman and Fred Whiting, Symposium Coordinator. Bruce and Fred are the MUFON State Directors for Maryland and Virginia respectively. The theme will emphasize the international scope of the 40-year old mystery, since it will be commemorating the fortieth anniversary of Kenneth Arnold's sighting near Mt. Rainier, initiating the modern era of Ufology. In addition to inviting speakers from all continents to relate the status of Ufology in their part of the world, a new practice will be introduced whereby short contributed papers will be solicited and presented. The \"First Call for Papers\" appears in this issue of the Journal along with the conditions under which they will be submitted, accepted and presented. This is a standard practice for scientific society symposia. * * * Marvin E. Taylor, Jr., State Director for Northern California, has announced that the Second Sonora UFO Symposium will be held on October 11 and 12, 1986 at the Sonora Fairgrounds in Sonora, California. Dr. J.
