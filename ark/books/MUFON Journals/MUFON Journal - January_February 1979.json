FROM THE EDITOR The frequent inclusion of humanoid and abduction cases, it must be said from time to time, does not mean that we believe or accept the reports at face value. When there is no reason to discount the cases initially, we put them \"on the record\" where they are fair game for analysis, criticism, and further investigation. Some may turn out to be concoctions or psychological cases, but we won't know that without investigation. Recently we were about to publish an elaborate humanoid sighting on the basis of detailed interviews of the one witness. However, information pooled by three separate MUFON units — each of which had had independent contact with the witness — revealed serious, fundamental discrepancies in what he had told each. Unless these can be resolved, it would appear that the witness has discredited himself. I am personally convinced that investigators are seriously underrating the possibility that psychological factors generate many cases that are \"real\" only in the mind of disturbed persons. That, however, is just a personal opinion. Only careful investigation and research on a case-by-case basis will help to resolve the many baffling questions posed by persistent humanoid and abduction reports.

Leet (Copyright 1979 by William D. Leet) On that cold, dark night of November 24, 1944, when my B-17 crew and I were briefed to fly a \"Lone Wolf bombing mission to Salzburg, no mention was made of \"Foo Fighters.\" The officer who gave us the intelligence part of the briefing listed the number of heavy and light antiaircraft guns we could expect at the target, and what types and how many German fighters might hit us. We were also given these figures for alternate targets, in case we had to bomb one of. them because of inability to reach the primary target: the railroad marshalling yards at Salzburg. We were also briefed on escape routes and procedures to follow if we should be shot down, but parachute safely to the ground and have a chance to make it back to Allied lines. There was no mention whatsoever in the briefing that there was a chance of our being encountered by a Foo Fighter. Kenneth Arnold's vista of the \"Flying Saucers\" was yet to occur, and years would pass before Captain Edward Ruppelt's coining of \"UFO,\" but our Intelligence people knew very well that the Foo Fighters were real. Intelligence officers interrogated pilots and crews after combat missions, and had received numerous accounts of the unearthly craft over Europe and the Pacific. As the UFO cover-up had already commenced, 'and this vital information was prohibited to flying personnel, my Flying Fortress crew of ten men and I were unprepared for the confrontation we were to meet with on that mission. We could not have been prepared, of course, for battle with aerial weapons far advanced of ours, and as it turned out that was no problem. 'But for some way to get out of the dilemma into which my crew and I flew in our B-17, we had no mental and emotional readiness. We accomplished our mission, but it could be that we returned safely to our base more by luck than by our own training and ingenuity. The 15th Air Force, operating long-range heavy bombers from airfields in southern Italy, flew at high altitudes far into Nazi-held Europe. The B-17s and B-24s destroyed strategic objectives — oil refineries, principally — bombing in great formations by day. Great Britain's big bombers of the Royal Air Force kept it incessant, night- bombing the enemy, and he was allowed no respite. The relentless onslaught was interrupted by the severe weather of late 1944 grounding the massive formations, so the 5th Bomb Wing initiated the Lone Wolf missions to harrass the Nazis. B-17s were sent out singly to separate targets, causing minor damage as contrasted to the devastation wreaked by bomber formations, but keeping the German workers under constant air raid warnings and away from the refineries and factories. It was on such a Lone Wolf flight that we made our takeoff that November night. As the pilot of \"Old Crow,\" the B- 17 I nearly always had on combat missions and called \"my airplane,\" my intention was to push the big bird up just as high as she would go — 30,000 feet, at least. I had bombed at Salzburg one time and learned first hand that the Krauts there had master sergeants firing their antiaircraft guns. When we returned to our field at Amendola, the crew chief and I counted 240 flak holes in Old Crow. Miraculously, not an engine had been shot out, there had been no fires on board, and not a man on my crew was wounded. We were over Salzburg at 25,000 feet that day. Tonight, with me calling the shots, we would be much higher where the flak was not so ferocious, and we'd have better prospects of a good bomb strike and returning safely to home base. My plans were changed on takeoff. I eased the four throttles to max power and we raced down the perforated steel runway with no trouble, but we were hardly airborne when one of the superchargers disintegrated. That meant that we could climb no higher than 18,000, much too low for Salzburg. The navigator, bombardier and I selected Klagenfurt for an alternate target. We .would blast the railroad yards at Klagenfurt and the freight cars loaded with war material that were marshalled there, and send the laborers to the air raid shelters for the night. Old Crow reached 18,000 feet only from my patient coaxing. She was over- loaded, carrying thousands of pounds of fuel, ammunition and bombs above the maximum gross weight that Boeing, her designer and manufacturer, had set. It surprised me that the loss of one of four superchargers made such a difference in her ceiling, but once I had nudged her up to 18,000 the stable old warrior mushed right along. The weather had improved considerably — there was a high overcast blackening the sky, but m.uch of the time we were not in clouds and icing conditions. We flew a north-northwesterly course up the Adriatic Sea, and upon making a landfall at Trieste we had only a short distance to Klagenfurt. The night was so dark that I was piloting Old Crow by instruments, but soon after turning on the bomb run and opening the bomb bay doors, we were in a blinding light. I felt the heat from it, and thought the Krauts had caught us in their searchlights, but it lasted only two or three seconds. We kept flying the bomb run, approaching the instant for bombs away, but I was relieved to see and feel no more of the light. I thought no more about it as this was the crucial moment of our mission, and I concentrated on maintaining a constant airspeed and keeping Old Crow flying straight and level, so the bombardier could put the bombs precisely on target."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Foo-Fightcr, Continued) '''\"\";,- Upon bombs away Old Crow leaped upward, freed of her ten 500 pound bombs, and I whipped her off the target, scurrying for safety. It was then I realized that we had gotten no flak on the bomb run; and where were the Messerschmidt night fighters? As much as we had disrupted their oil production, surely they had enough gas to fly fighters up to attack one lorie B- 17. Well, no need to tempt Fate, I knew. No flak and no fighters was peculiar, nevertheless — unprecedented. . Heading back toward Trieste, all at once there appeared just off our left wing a round amber light. None of us saw it approach or had any sight of it until it was right ; beside the B-17, flying alongjn formation .with us. The object's outline was a perfect circle — too perfect; its- color was a luminous orange-yel|ow — too luminous. We could only guesstimate its distance and size. To me, it looked to be about 50 yards out from the wingtip, 10 yards to the rear, and 10 feet in diameter. Was it 100 yards distant and 20 feet in diameter? I was aware of ; a fascination while observing it. . The gunners wanted to shoot whatever-it-was with their fifty calibers but I ordered them not to — if the thing was hostile, we would have been shot down without ever having seen it. As we coursed on through ,the black night, winging homeward to our, field in the south of Italy, the weird craft kept us company. Its position relative to Old Crow's did not vary, its shape did not change, and its brilliance never wavered. I was unable to ascertain the form of the bogey; it could have been a sphere, or a disk at 90 degrees to the earth's surface, but it definitely was not the exhaust or lights from another aircraft. It positively was neither manmade nor a natural occurrence. After 45 to 50 minutes, our companion from another world simply turned off. Precisely.the way that an electric light goes out when turned off by flipping a switch, that is how the Foo Fighter disappeared — it turned off. The rest of our return to Amendola was uneventful, and after landing and riding the truck from the field to 2nd Bomb Group Operations, an Intelligence officer conducted our debriefing. When we had reported the standard items of weather, the alternate target we hit, bomb,strike accuracy, and the fact that we encountered no enemy resistance, I mentioned the momentary light we flew into on the bomb run, and inquired whether there, were searchlights at Klagenfurt. No, ours was the first such report. . The description I gave of the amber object and its behavior met the quick explanation that it was a \"New secret German fighter.\" To my answer that it did not. shoot , at us, the Intelligence officer rebutted that it was radioing our course, altitude and airspeed to the German antiaircraft batteries. When I reminded him that we had not seen one burst of flak the entire night, he said nothing more — he had run out of stock answers. He had told us-all that he could tell. . The superior performance of American Intelligence in WWII was essential to our victory, but an unwise policy was the withholding from combat personnel of information about the Foo Fighters. When our confrontation occurred on that Lone Wolf mission, ,• had we been forearmed with the knowledge reported to Intelligence previously, we would have reacted with more certainty and confidence. We, and other crews in similar encounters, could have disproved the false assumption that Foo Fighters were German weapons, and further assisted our. war effort. A more enlighted strategy concerning these early manifestations by the ., Foo Fighters , would have brought the dawn of our understanding the UFO phenomenon. The flash of light that struck our B-17 on the bomb run; the absence of German fighters and flak; the appearance and actions of the Foo Fighter; our receiving no interference with our bombing or other electronics — our calm discernment and reporting of such data to Intelligence would have been of inestimable value had they prepared us for it, and then listened to our reports. So, the most important products of the Lone Wolf mission to Klagenfurt were lost: improvement of combat effectiveness, and insight • into visitations from another world. Multiply BALLOON SIGHTING DISCOUNTED The alleged sighting of a UFO by the crew of the record-setting balloon \"Double Eagle II\" during its transatlantic flight last year has been flatly denied. The tabloid \"People,\" in its issue of October 8,1978, had claimed in an unsigned article that four UFOs had approached the balloon and rocked the gondola on the third night of flight, and that the story had been suppressed by the U.S. Government but had leaked out in France. Tom Benson (MUFON State Section Director in, Trenton, N.J.) wrote to the balloonists in December enclosing a copy of the article. Ben Abruzzo, one of the three balloonists, replied on January 3,1979. \"There was no sighting,\" he said. \"That article was totally fictitious.\" MUFON: ANOTHER FIRST The August 1978 MUFON UFO Journal contained an article by Todd Zechel describing the anti-secrecy legal initiatives being undertaken by Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) and Ground Saucer Watch, pointing out the lack of support by other groups and asking for contributions. MUFON members have responded generously, and Zechel thanked them in the January issue of Just Cause. ' ' • \"The response (by MUFON) has been most encouraging:...,\" he said. \"MUFON members have contributed much-needed funds to these efforts, and CAUS wishes to express its deep gratitude.\" this by many, many UFO confron- tations in World War II. Decisions of truth and positive, action involve additional hazards, but danger is inherent in a program of deception. And who knows what perils are imbedded in the cover-up that continues to this day?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"UFOs IN ARAB NATIONS By Richard Hall Newspapers in November 1978 carried brief reports (also mentioned on some radio and TV newscasts) about the reported landing and take-off of a totally soundless cylindrical UFO \"with a huge dome and a flashing red light,\" sighted by oil company technicians in a Kuwaiti oil field. Temporary disruption of telecommunications was reported, and an oil pumping station near the landing site ceased to function. Almost no follow-up information has been forthcoming, but MUFON has learned some additional details. P. G. Jacob, a marine biologist employed by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research, wrote to MUFON: \"Recently (from 9th November, 1978) there had been a number of sightings of UFOs here in Kuwiat....All the sightings occurred in the oil fields of Kuwait Oil Company, the major oil producing concern in Kuwait. The last one occurred on (the) 21st Tuesday morning (between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m.) over the Al Sabriyah oil field near the Iraqui border and one man was able to take a number of photographs of the object.\" Oil company employees first saw a UFO November 9 at \"Gathering Centre No. 24,\" supported by staff of \"Centre No. 15\" who also said they had seen the object, according to the Kuwait Times, November 16. \"It is learnt that the KOC (Kuwait Oil Company) has supplied cameras to its specialized staff on field duty so that they can take pictures if the object is spotted again.\" A team from the institute, assisted by police and army personnel, conducted an extensive search of the area but found no trace of the object. The Kuwait Times reported, November 18, that a KOC spokesman had denied the company issued cameras'to its staff. The Arab Times reported November 23, however, that during the sightings November 21 at the Al Sabriyah oil field, \"One man, who had been given a camera by the oil company to record just such a reoccurrence managed to take a number of photographs of the object as it flew over a twenty-foot water tower and hovered in the area for thirty minutes, between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m. As with previous sightings, all long distance communications were disrupted, but internal phones continued to operate enabling oil company employees to contact their supervisor, who rushed out in time to witness the object....Results of the photography have not been disclosed. On December 5, Arab Times reported that a photograph had been taken over the shore of Dubai, on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirate (UAE) territory, by an employee of the Passport and Nationality Department. The photograph was reproduced .in the December 12 issue. \"It is a disc,\" said the paper, \"with a dome protruding in the middle and completely lit up rather like a neon sign or fluorescent tube.\" Employees of the UAE Teleco- mmunications Agency (Emritel) were alerted in November after 11 people reported a UFO sighting at Abu Dhabi. The Arab Times for November 25, quoting the newspaper Al-Ittihad, said, \"...instructions had been issued to all Emritel employees, particularly those at earth stations, to be on the alert for UFOs and to make all efforts to photograph and track them should one reappear.\" Another UFO was seen in Kuwait by at least 10 people, and photographed by an Arab Times reporter, on January 20. Two of the photographs (blobs of light) appeared in the Arab Times, January 21. The object seemed to be rotating, changing from circular to UFO Seen in Kuwait more triangular in form, as it hovered; then \"...it disappeared in the direction of Iran at great speed.\" A photograph of the object moving away shows a blurred image. Finally, the investigating committee established by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research held a press conference on January 23, spurred on, they said, by the Arab Times photograph, to which \"The committee attaches special importance....\" They admitted that they were \"groping in the dark,\" and said they could neither confirm nor deny the appearance of UFOs over Kuwait. The report of the press conference in the Arab Times, January 24, includes a photograph of sketches made from the witness reports, two very similar \"domed discs.\" (See reproduction with this article.) The Arab world apparently experienced its first UFO \"flap\" (as far as is known in the West) during the period from November 1978 through January 1979, at the same time as widespread sightings in Australia and New Zealand. Throughout this seeming major wave of UFO sightings stretching from the Middle East to Australia and New Zealand, American television networks and wire services gave only superficial coverage. Most of the Arab nation sightings occurred along a 500-mile stretch of the Persian Gulf coastline, opposite Iran."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"NI-C1A-AP OR NIGAP? By Todd Zechel (Excerpts reprinted by permission from Just Cause, January 1979; newsletter of Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, P.O. Box 4743, Arlington, VA 22204; subscription $12. Since the article is long, even as excerpted, it is reproduced here in small type. The only amendment I would make is that during.the Keyhoe-Hall era of NICAP, we never knowingly accepted legitimately classified information .'from anyone, only \"hidden\" information, unclassified, but not known to the public. I publicly thank Mr. Zechel for his excellent detective work and his invaluable advice to me .during the recent period when I was negotiating with the NICAP Board. I had proposed plans for 'NICAP's merger with other serious groups, not to rebuild it as a competitive organization. To say that the NIGAP representatives misled me and. were less than forthright in their dealings is an understatement. I am deeply sadened by the destruction of NICAP since 1970 and its apparent use today as someone's propaganda tool for ulterior purposes -7 Richard Hall, Editor.) When space propulsion researcher T.' •Tbwnserid Brown founded the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena in October 1956, at least two CIA covert agents worked themselves into key positions with the organization. One, an ultra-mysterious character named \"Count\" Nicolas de Rochefort, was a Russian immigrant and employee of the CIA's Psychological Warfare staff, where the \"Count\" wrote scripts in French and Russian for Voice of America radio broadcasts, among other covert missions. \"Count\" de Rochefort managed to get himself appointed Vice-Chairman of NICAP in late 1956. ' The \"Count\" was a controversial ultra-right- winger'and a leading force in the lobbying effort to prevent Red China from being recognized or admitted to the U.N. For covers (visible employment to mask his CIA involvement), he utilized professorships at Georgetown and American Universities, as well as claiming to be ah escort interpreter with the State Department. The other CIA agent was an even more mysterious person named Bernard J. O. Carvalho, a native of Lisbon, Portugal. Among other missions, Carvalho had been a cut-out (go- between) man for such CIA proprietaries (secretly, owned companies) as Fairway Corporation, a charter airline utilized by Agency executives. He managed to get himself appointed to chairman of the group's (NICAP's) membership subcommittee, a key position.... Because Townsend Brown was mostly a dreamer with ambitions loftier than he could even hope to fulfill (such as publishing at. least .two monthly magazines and a salary structure for the NICAP staff that many corporations would have envied), he was stripped of his leadership position in January 1957 and Major (USMC-Ret.) Donald Keyhoe was appointed President of NICAP.... Evidently because Keyhoe's attacks on the government excluded the CIA and were mostly barbs hurled at the Air Force and the so-called \"Silence Group\" within it, shortly after assuming the reins of NICAP he managed to induce Vice- Admiral (USN-Ret.) Roscoe Hillenkoetter, former and original Director of the CIA (1947-50), to join NICAP's Board of Governors. Hillenkoetter was a classmate of Keyhoe's at the Naval Academy, and his service as a figurehead on Keyhoe's chosen board gave the organization and Keyhoe a tremendous boost in credibility. , Hillenkoetter told Keyhoe privately that the CIA had been interested in UFOs from the very Beginning (June 1947) of reports, and kept a watchful eye on the subject despite the lack of directives to do so. He also allowed himself to be quoted as saying: \"The Air Force has constantly misled the American public about UFOs...I urge Congressional action to reduce the danger from , secrecy.\" : In 1961, Keyhoe began sending his\"proof\" of UFO \"reality, censorship and the increasing \"hazards of secrecy\" to Congress, hoping to initiate an investigation by the House Science and Astronautics Committee. In May of 1961 the House Space Committee formed a subcommittee to look into UFOs: In August Keyhoe sent the committee members a statement signed by Hillenkoetter. \"Acting with the majority of the NICAP Board of Governors, I urge immediate Congressional action to reduce the dangers from secrecy about UFOs,\" Hillenkoetter said. He listed .the dangers as: \"The risk of accidental war, from mistaking UFO formations for a Soviet surprise attack. (2) The danger that the Soviet government may, in a critical moment, falsely claim the UFOs as secret Russian weapons against which our defenses are helpless.\" By early 1962, Keyhoe was well on the way to forcing Congress to open hearings on UFOs and the Air Force's means of dealing with the subject. Even though much of Keyhoe's evidence was predicated on confidential informers he couldn't be certain would testify, he was counting on Hillenkoetter's willingness to make condemnations of Air Force UFO policies to carry the day. But suddenly Hillenkoetter pulled the rug out from under him by abruptly resigning from the Board, and Keyhoe's Congressional investigation collapsed faster than a three-story house of cards. Hillenkoetter's letter of resignation said: \"In my opinion, NICAP's investigation has gone as far as possible. I know UFOs are not U.S. or Soviet devices....The Air Force carinot do any more under the circumstances...and I believe we should not continue to criticize their, investigations...\"    .. Since Hillenkoetter's letter represented an almost total reversal from his earlier positions, Keyhoe has long suspected the Admiral was pressured by the CIA and/or the Air Force to drop out of the picture and quit • making troublesome statements. But until the GSW FOIA lawsuit, Keyhoe's suspicions remained unconfirmed. Without going into details at the present time, CAUS has determined that Hillenkoetter was in fact pressured by the Agency at the behest of the Air Force, which communicated a number of complaints about Hillenkoetter's role in NICAP to high-level Agency officials. But while the CIA and Air Force put extensive pressure on a former. CIA Director in order to persuade him to drop his involvement with NICAP, another Board member who held a high-level position in the CIA apparently wasn't pressured at all and remains on the Board to this day. His name is Col. (USAF-Ret.) Joseph Bryan, III. He is the founder and original Chief of the CIA's Psychological Warfare Staff (1947-53). And until CAUS's Director of Research Brad C. Sparks uncovered Bryan's covert employment with the CIA during the course of his interviews with former CIA employees', very few people-- including Keyhoe-knew of Bryan's CIA connections. But Bryan has now confirmed these connections in interviews with CAUS Director Todd Zechel in 1977 and 1978. Bryan approached Keyhoe in late 1959, asking to see some of his \"really hot cases.\" Since Bryan was ostensibly an Air Force officer, Keyhoe immediately suspected an AF plot to infiltrate his organization, and he resisted the Colonel's advances. However, Bryan soon put Keyhoe's mind at ease by allowing himself to be publicly quoted as saying: \"The UFOs are interplanetary devices systematically observing the Earth, either manned or remote-controlled, or both. Information on UFOs has been officially withheld. This policy is dangerous.\" Contrast Bryan's 'statement to Keyhoe, which led to his being invited to serve on the Board of Governors, to the one he made in March 1977, describing his reason for joining NICAP: \"I thought the government was neglecting it, was turning its back on it, closing its eyes to it, and I thought' somebody ought to take over-and express an interest in it. Don Keyhoe, whom I respected and admired very much, seemed to.be the leader in this thing so I joined up with him.\" (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(NICAP, Continued) While admitting to having been a former covert official for the CIA and asking that ths fact not be made public since \"it might embarrass CIA,\" Bryan denied any association or communication with the CIA during the period he has served on the NICAP Board. However, when it was suggested to Bryan that two CIA covert agents had penetrated NICAP in the very beginning, he remarked: \"Penetrated! Good God! What do you want to penetrate NICAP for? There's nothing to penetrate about—it was all overt, the whole thing.\" Bryan may well be right. Former CIA briefing officer Karl Pflock was chairman of NICAP's Washington, D.C. subcommittee during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Pflock denies the Agency ever asked him for' information on UFOs or NICAP, although he kept his CIA affiliation secret from most NICAP officials. But someone close to NICAP gave the CIA information on the group, as a 1973 document recently, released to GSW reveals. The undated CIA document, written by an unnamed person from an unnamed component of the Agency, indicates some familiarity with G. Stuart Nixon, at the time a top assistant to NICAP President John L. (Jack) Acuff. Interestingly, the NICAP daily activity logs from the late 1960s and early 1970s reflect that Nixon met with several past and present (then) CIA employees on'a frequent basis. The CIA officials include Art Lundahl, then the Director of the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center, Fred Durant, author of the Robertson Panel Report and a former CIA Office of Scientific Intelligence missile expert, and Dr. Charles Sheldon •, a consultant to the Agency now with the Library of Congress. Another former CIA employee Nixon says he's had \"dozens\" of conversations with is Col. Joseph Bryan. Curiously, however, none of the NICAP logs reflect any conversations between Nixon or Bryan, either by phone or in person, although almost every other daily occurrence is denoted in the logs. Questioned recently about' this discrepancy, Nixon refused to comment. Even more curious is the fact Nixon refuses to discuss his involvement in the ouster of Keyhoe from his. position of NICAP President on December 3, 1969. However, it should be noted Nixon's \"no comment\" stance serves him better than Col. Bryan's statements on the same matter. Bryan flatly denied during a 1977 interview that he had anything to do with Keyhoe's abrupt removal from his President's position. In fact, Bryan asked the interviewer, Todd Zechel, to comunicate a message to Keyhoe. \"Please tell him that I had nothing whatsoever to do with it,\" pleaded Bryan. Yet, NICAP files on the December 3, 1969, executive committee meeting in which Keyhoe was voted out clearly establish that Bryan not only was Chairman of the Board of Governors at the time, but that he wrote and distributed a memo in which he called Keyhoe \"inept\". Evidently, this memo, .coming from the Chairman of the Board, helped convince an otherwise loyal- to-Keyhoe panel to approve his firing.... Keyhoe's abrupt dismissal paved the way for Jack Acuff to be appointed the new President of NICAP. Acuff had been meeting with Stuart Nixon since mid-1968, seemingly waiting in the wings. Prior to his NICAP appointment, Acuff had been the head of the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers (SPSEj, a Washington- based group that had been the target of frequent KGB spying attempts. Apparently, the Soviets were interested in the Society because a targe number of its members were photo-analysts with Department of Defense intelligence components and with the CIA. Acuff, because of his role as the head of SPSE, was approached by Soviet agents on several . occasions. He reported these approaches to the FBI and subsequently began to meet with the KGB agents in behalf of Washington FBI office, acting, in effect, as a covert agent. In May 1977, Acuff was once again approached by Soviet agents, but this time they expressed an interest in UFOs. Acuff contacted the FBI and the Bureau gave him the go-ahead to play along with the KGB officials. However, other than making a few ambiguous comments about offering Acuff money, the Soviets never did make clear what their intentions were. Recently, however, Acuff disclosed he stands ready to continue cooperating with the FBI and would meet with the Soviet agents if they contacted him. Since taking over NICAP, Acuff has converted the organization from being a vocal and persistent critic of the government's UFO policies to being a rather \"passive recipient\" of civilian UFO reports. The group's investigating network, the subcommittees, was disbanded shortly after Acuff took the job. But even though NICAP offered the public very little in the way of original investigations or research, and its newsletter, \"UFO Investigator,\" became mostly ca collection, of unspectacular sighting reports mailed in by loyal members, NICAP managed to maintain a subscribing membership in excess of 3,000. Since Keyhoe had been accused of mis- management or non-management, and NICAP under his leadership had constantly teetered on the brink of bankruptcy, the hiring of a professional manager in the person of Acuff was evidently a decision by the Board to put the group on solid financial footing. • Acuff achieved fiscal soundness in a hurry by firing all full-time NICAP employees—including, eventually, Nixon—(Nixon actually resigned under pressure) except for a secretary whose salary was spread between NICAP and several other nonprofit groups Acuff managed under one roof. After a slow start, NICAP was soon bringing in around $50,000 a year under Acuff. However, . usually around $35,000 of the NICAP income went to Acuff Associates for \"contracting services,\" which included part of the secretary's salary, Acuffs salary, and a few office expenses that were also split with the other groups being managed out of the same office. For example: In 1975, NICAP's total receipts came to $50,333.59. Of that income; Acuff received a flat $35,000 for his management fee or \"contracting services.\" (The contracting services fee does not include the newsletter expenses except for whatever portion of the secretary's time was involved in typing it; all other newsletter expenses were listed separately in disbursements.) During 1975, $76 of the $50,000 income was spent on \"general research\". In 1976, NICAP began its downward financial slide. It received $41,690.05, nearly $10,000 less than the previous year. Acuff, however, took a cut of only $1,000, claiming $34,000 for contracting services. That year, $20 went for general research. (The ridiculously low research figures may account for at least part of the decline in income.) By 1977, Acuff was claiming NICAP owed him money; telling Todd Zechel in May 1977 that \"NICAP isn't pulling its own weight.\" In 1978, things took an even greater turn for the worse. In order to raise money, Acuff took to selling some of NICAP's supposedly outdated mailing lists. Unfortunately for Acuff, one of his customers turned out to be a neo-Nazi group headquartered in Canada, Samisdat. By August 1978, a new and controversial character emerged from out of NICAP's past: \"Dr\" Williard (a.k.a. \"Willard\") F. Mclntyre, a . former photographic consultant to the group and friend of Stuart Nixon. Mclntyre began accusing Acuff of knowingly selling the mailing lists to the Nazis and told various UFOIogists around the country that Acuff intended to merge with Samisdat, or sell NICAP to them. In the meantime, Acuff had been approached by Aerial Phenomena Research Organization, a pro- contactee group based in Tucson, Arizona. Jim Lorenzen, APRO's International Director, asked Acuff if he was interested in selling NICAP. Acuff evidently replied affirmatively, and a price in the $40,000 range was discussed. In actual fact, Acuff had been tricked into selling NICAP's mailing lists to the Nazis by the Nazis' use of a front-group called \"The Idea Center,\" which they employed whenever they wished to mask the Nazi affiliation. But Mclntyre continued with his vociferous accusations, inciting many former NICAP members and employe'es to start an ad-hoc group called \"The Ad-Hoc Committee To Preserve NICAP\". The ad-hoc members, which 'included John Carlson, Dick Hall and Larry Bryant, worked, behind the scenes to block any attempts by Acuff to sell NICAP's potentially valuable files to someone who might misuse and abuse them, or keep them hidden away for selfish reasons. • While Mclntyre worked frantically to thwart what he thought was a sellout to the Nazis, he began to assert privately that he was a former covert agent of the CIA and said he knew Acuff had worked for the CIA too. Interviewed by CAUS Director Todd Zechel in August 1978, Mclntyre said he had utilized the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers (SPSE) as a cover for his CIA employment. Jack Acuff, then the head of SPSE, had known about his covert CIA activity and willingly cooperated With it, Mclntyre alleged. Mclntyre also claimed that he first joined NICAP around 1967, while working at the CIA's National Photo Interpretation Center (NPIC). Contrary to Agency policy, Mclntyre said he did i not clear his NICAP membership with his (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(NICAP, Continued) employers, and was subsequently called on the carpet for not reporting it. According to Mclntyre, while he was being verbally reprimanded for his failure to notify his superiors, Col. Joseph Bryan's name was mentioned as the source of the information that a covert CIA agent (Mclntyre) had infiltrated NICAP. Mclntyre named his CIA superiors as Jim Atherton and William Leftwich. He also identified a building at 1000 N. Glebe Road, Arlington, Va., as a secret CIA center. However, under subsequent questioning, Mclntyre failed to recognize the building's commonly-known (within CIA circles) nickname, \"Blue U.\" (so- named for the blue panels that are an eye- catching part of its appearance). A CAUS investigation determined Jim Atherton and William Leftwich both worked in the photographic field, which • Mclntyre had been associated with for a number of years, but neither had ever worked for the CIA. Because Mclntyre failed to recognize \"Blue U.\" and didn't seem to know it was a CIA training center, and had incorrectly referred to CIA's clandestine component as \"DDT\" (rather than DDP-Deputy Director for Plans), and had given erroneous information about two persons in the photographic field, CAUS officials decided to disregard his allegations about both Acuff and Col. Joseph Bryan. In the meantime, however, Mclntyre's accusations that Acuff was about to \"merge with the Nazis\" stirred up interest on Capitol Hill. Senator Barry Goldwater (R-Arizona), a NICAP Board member since 1974, was alerted of Acuff s alleged Nazi deal through his aid, Charles Lombard, with whom Mclntyre had apparently spoken. By mid-September 1978, it was clear Acuff wanted out of the NICAP job, claiming the organization owed him a rather large sum of money : . Key ad-hoc committee members began contacting the NICAP Board to offer taking possession of the files should the group fold. Dick Hall of MUFON and John Carlson of INFO proposed a coalition between NICAP, MUFON, CUFOS (Dr. J. Allen Hynek's Center For UFO Studies) and INFO. In general, the reaction to Acuff s handling of NICAP was one of outraged disgust by former NICAP officials and employees, many of whom had lost interest in the group's activities over the past several years. The basis of the former NICAPers anger was the feeling they had all worked and sacrificed to make NICAP a potent influence during the mid-1960s; they had assembled an investigating network that the Air Force could never hope to match. Now, they felt, Acuff had lived off the reputation they had established, had sucked it dry and then wanted to dump it. Or, as one former NICAP employeee put it, \"Acuff got on a damn good horse and rode it until it dropped. He never took care of it or fed it, and now he's trying to sell the bones.\" The NICAP Board, meantime, hadn't seemed to have been bothered by the fact Acuff took in over $50,000 in 1974 and spent only a paltry $67 on research (investigations), or that in 1973 he took in over $48,000, and in 1975 over $50,000 again, with similar miniscule amounts 8 expended for \"general research\". Neither did they seem to be bothered by NICAP's dwindling membership and an almost total lack of respect for the group throughout the world. What did bother the Board, evidently, was Acuff s faux pas in selling the group's mailing lists to Samisdat, and the fact past and present NICAP subscribers were suddenly being deluged with Nazi brochures. Charles Lombard, Sen. Goldwater's aide, was incensed and worried about the possible effect Acuffs boner would have on his boss. (Goldwater's opponents could have a field-day with a -Nazi tie-in to the conservative Senator.) . Thus, by the October 17, 1978, Acuffs fate was sealed—he was though as NICAP's President. Following the meeting, Board members reported Acuff had \"resigned\". But Acuff was allowed to remain on the Board, apparently in an effort to stave off his demand to be paid in excess of $20,000 he claimed NICAP owed him for \"contracting services\". The files would also remain in Acuffs custody. (One former NICAPer said, \"He's holding the files as ransom.\") While the Board more or less rejected the ad- hoc committee's idea for a coalition at the Oct. 17th meeting, it did decide to work out some sort of merger with Dr. Hynek and CUFOS. At the same meeting, two new board members were voted in: Charles Lombard, Sen. Goldwater's aide, and John Fisher, head of the American Security Council, an ultra-conservative political lobbying group. Toward the end of October, former NICAP Director under Major Keyhoe, Richard H. (Dick) Hall, began making proposals to the Board and offering to serve as Acuffs replacement. Hall's overtures were met with.mixed reponse by key board members: Gen. (USAF-Ret.) Robert Richardson and Joseph Hartranft reacted favorably, telling Hall he was their most -likely candidate. Charles Lombard, on the other hand, seemed to feel Hall wasn't qualified for the position as he defined it. Lombard indicated in an October 30th meeting with Hall and Dr. Hynek, wherein Hynek had flown into Washington as his own expense since NICAP claimed its treasury was totally empty, that he was searching for a \"White Knight\" to rescue NICAP—a retired government official with management experience who could tap corporations and foundations for donations. Yet, even though Lombard seemed to be set on appointing an ex-intelligence official of some sort, Richardson kept telling Hall he was their most promising prospect and would probably be appointed at the November 29th meeting. However, not only was Hall not appointed in the November meeting, he was dropped from consideration. Also suffering at the meeting was the proposal to merge with CUFOS and have NICAP newsletter subscribers -receive the International UFO Reporter magazine as a substitute for the nearly-defunct UFO /nuestigator. Acuff, the resigned President, seemed to be at least partially responsible for blocking the CUFOS merger, apparently because he had discovered the Center was nearly as moneyless as NICAP. Acuff seemed to be in favor of a merger with APRO, which indicated it had substantial. funds or access to them. (Most observers feel Acuff wants to be paid off and doesn't feel the CUFOS deal would achieve a .quick payment of his \"contracting services\".) ' Thus, by January 1979, NICAP was still wallowing in confusion. The Board had talked in glowing terms about raising funds for UFO research by utilizing John Fisher's Communi- cation Corporation of America, a conservative fund-raising mechanism, but details of the campaign to raise money were slow in being worked out. Apparently, up-front money was needed to get the effort started, but neither NICAP or CUFOS had operating funds enough to swing it. In the meantime, Lombard's search for a \"White Knight\" took a humorous turn. Art Lundahl, a retired CIA official living in Bethesda, Md., was offered the NICAP Presidency by an unnamed board member in early January. Lundahl quickly pointed out the storm of protest such an appointment would arouse and declined the offer. Subsequently, several other retired CIA officials were offered the job. Finally, one accepted. The new \"White Knight\" is Alan N. Hall, about 60, a retired CIA employee living in Bethesda. Reportedly, Hall has agreed to fill Acuffs shoes for a 6-month trial period on a volunteer basis, without pay. Not much is known about Hall's background at the moment, except that he evidently worked in some technical capacity—perhaps with the Office of Scientific Intelligence, or in the DDS&T directorate. Obviously, the appointment of a retired CIA employee raises some serious questions of propriety. During the late 1950s and early-mid- 1960s, NICAP, under Keyhoe, received a great deal of confidential information on UFO cases that were being kept secret; military and intelligence sources repeatedly leaked inside UFO info to Keyhoe. Apparently because of its past reputation, NICAP continued to have confidential UFO data leaked to it during Acuffs tenure. In late 1976, for example, an officer in the Pentagon provided Acuff with copies of a number of classified documents, including the now- famous Iranian report and several other \"hot\" reports. In 1978, an NSA employee supplied Acuff with information about domestic UFO reports that were coming in through NSA's communications system. The fact Acuff was working as a covert agent in behalf of the FBI raises some obvious questions about how these confidential sources were handled. And now that a retired CIA employee is taking Acuffs place, even more serious questions are raised. Like: What happens to someone who walks in and hands Alan Hall a classified UFO report, not knowing the strong government ties? Does the source ever again see the light of day? Who knows, maybe this is all a setup. One would naturally have to be suspicious of any board of governors that was comprised of two former CIA covert employees (Bryan and Lombard), a retired Air Force General once associated with the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), the component that took over UFO analysis, and an ultra-conservative political (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"WEST VIRGINIA FLAP-PART 2 By Ted Spickler (MUFON State Director for West Virginia) Although the principal flap sightings that drew so much publicity appear to have been generated by stars, there were some more puzzling cases hiding in the woodwork.

It was still dark at 7:15 and Joyce Dehner was ,not particularly thinking about anything; if queried about flying saucers at that moment, she would have laughed them off as people imagining things. She saw off to her left some green, red, and white lights coming over a low hill and idly thought to herself that an airplane was strangely low and flying too slow. The thing approached closer and dipped down to within a few feet above an interstate bridge that she was approaching.

Maybe it's just a coincidence that the founder of the CIA's Psychological Warfare Staff has been on the board for nearly twenty years. Maybe it's another coincidence that Charles Lombard, a former CIA covert employee (according to himself) would seek out a retired CIA executive to run the organization after a covert agent for the FBI had decided to resign when the money ran out.... To come right out and say it was all a conspiracy would either be leaping at conclusions or stating the obvious—take your pick. But in the final analysis, the results speak for themselves. And the results are that if they wanted to destroy the leading anti-secrecy organization of the 1960s, they couldn't have done a better job if they'd tried....

A car ahead slowed down and then speeded up rapidly as if to get out of there in a hurry. Joyce followed; as she tromped on the gas the object silently \"floated like a feather\" across the bridge and suddenly shot up to the right over a set of trees where it momentarily hovered as she lost sight of it. Her terrified shaking did not settle down until far into the physical science lab whose content she can not remember from the distraction induced by the fear. Today Joyce is sincerely puzzled about the event and now believes in the reality of UFOs as representing \"something different.\" Her brother is assistant news director with the Huntingdon Herald Dispatch. He expressed a sober opinion about his sister's experience, \"I never believed in UFOs but now I don't know! Joyce is a low key, sensible person. If she said she saw something, she saw it! I just don't know what.\" Two phone interviews failed to turn up any information that could suggest a normal explanation. The object was the apparent size of a private plane but with no wings or propeller. The absence of any noise seems to rule out helicopters and the erratic feather float behavior is not what we would anticipate from an airplane. The case has not received a full investigation and hence the tentative ranking of this object as unknown must be understood in that light. Ten days after the Dehner sighting the northern panhandle of West Virginia apparently had a visiter in the sky seen by a considerable number of independent witnesses. It was around 7:00 Friday night, November 3 when Brooke County Deputy Sheriff Harry Ickes was driving northeast along route 88 as part of his usual patrol. He passed Deputy Sheriff Robert Stein who was traveling south. Within a few seconds they both saw a fireball in the sky to the northwest. As they discussed the incident over the radio, Stein turned around to join his colleague. Meanwhile John Chiesa, a resident of Bethany, drove up to ask officer Ickes if they knew what was happening. The primary concern of the group was for the possibility of a fire on the ground and the likelihood that they had witnessed the crash of an airplane. Shortly the analysis was interrupted by the appearance of a strange pair of red lights to the west. One was lower than the other giving the suggestion to the three men that a huge plane might be banking in the landing pattern for the Wheeling airport. This hypothesis was discarded when the lights leveled out and stopped moving. The oddity of this behavior grew as the lights continued to hover motionless for several minutes. The cruiser engines were shut off and in the ensuing silence the distant, dull, throbbing sound of low frequency humming could be heard coming from the hovering lights.

By Takao Ikeda (MUFON Representative for Japan) At Ginowan, Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture/Japan, a housewife (age 26) found the sugar beets in her north field flattened in a strange pattern when she arrived home on the evening of July 8, 1977. People assume that the pattern was formed by a strange luminous object she saw. Mr. Atuhiro Nagai of the local team learned of this incident from a story in the newspaper Ryu/cyu-Sinpo, and the full story was obtained by his investigation. About one-third of the field, which was about 660 square meters, was mown by the roots in a rectangular shape as if blown down by a violent wind. During the field investigation, Mr. Nagai found that a few meters away from the rectangular damage area were two additional circular areas of damage, one meter and .two meters in diameter. (See diagram.) That day at about 20:30 she was having dinner with her two children, when she saw by chance in the south sky, through the window, a luminous ovoid object hovering over the next- door two-story house. While she was gazing steadily at the object, it was slowly turning in a clockwise circle. After turning about five times, it flew away into a cloud. The size appeared to be about 50 centimeters diameter by eye measurement, the color was yellow or orange, and the intensity of light was not very glaring. The witness, who requested to remain anonymous, told Mr. Nagai that she was used to seeing various helicopters or propellor-type aircraft because the U.S. Marine Corps Futema Air Base was in the vicinity. She felt there was no possibility of a mistake. A sand pillar (\"dust devil\") theory was presented for this case, but nobody saw one and there was no blowing off of even one piece of beet leaf. Besides, if it (\"Continued on next page) (West Virginia, Continued) A bus containing the Brooke High School swim team pulled up and stopped. Tina Jackson, a member of the team, recalls that the bus driver had caught sight of the lights and was sufficiently puzzled by their appearance to stop for a better look. She could make out two big red lights with mist around them. They would pulsate, glowing from dull to bright, looking the \"size of dimes, lots bigger than the lights on an airplane. I never seen anything like it before,\" Tina reported, \"and I've seen plenty of airplanes. It didn't look like an airplane ,to ; me!\" Officer Stein had tried to shine his spotlight on the thing, pointing out that he could see objects in its beam clear across to the other side of the Ohio, River if it so pleased him to do so, but this object was too high up for the beam to reach (a lower limit to its distance away can be pegged at a few thousand feet). The apparent size coupled with some feeling for its range prompted the feeling that they were looking at something about 100 yards in length. The officers got into their cruisers as the object began to recede into the distance after an 8-minute period of hovering. Driving north along route 88, they finally lost sight of it when going around one of the many turns in the 10 road. Officer Stein now says, \"In a way I'm kinda sorry I told anybody I saw that thing. I've received nothing but harrassment. If there had not been another deputy I would never have said anything. It wasn't like anything I've ever seen before. It was not an airplane, it wasn't a blimp, and I don't know what it was.\" He reported the apparent size as two fists together with arms out stretched. No shape could be made out between the two lights but they were definitely hooked together. This case is considerably strengthened by the existence of another known set of witnesses who were ,even closer to the object. Deputy Sheriff Robert Hadden was on patrol along Cross Creek Road about 5 miles to the northwest from the location of the other officers. Unknown to them he was watching in awe as a gigantic dark shape with red lights, on either end drifted lazily over Brooke High School. Some students at the school saw his cruiser up the road and shouted to him as they themselves could not really believe what they were seeing. It was a clear night, and Hadden noted the absence of stars between the two lights and sensed the presence of an indistinct shape blotting out the stars. He watched it for about 5 minutes. \"Oh man! I was surprised,\" he said. \"I don't know what to think. First I thought that it was a blimp but then you;know I've, seen blimps before and they are a lot louder to begin with and also lit on the bottom. This thing just moved weird somehow. It has a humming sound but it wasn't a steady pitch. Like a throb going up and down; a real slow rise and fall.\" The Sheriff's deputies were sufficiently puzzled and impressed to begin an investigation immediately. Calls were placed to all local airports and to the 911th Troop Carrier Wing and the two National Guard units at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport. No one could give them any idea as to what they were seeing. The deputies were really suspicious when three jet fighters made a pass through the area and back again. The men were familiar with the usual amount of air traffic, having patrolled the region for years. They report that a transport plane also showed up and feel that someone has not been straight with them about what happened. The only aspect of this sighting that can be explained is the initial fireball. Nearly 40 residents reported seeing it and we can be sure that it was of astronomical origin and unrelated to the red giant."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The damaged beet field: was it caused by a UFO? was caused by a sand pillar, the damage trace should be linear along its path of motion.

Bosga (Mr. Bosga was for a time an assistant at the Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois. This sighting, which he investigated after returning to the Netherlands, occurred in Uden, Netherlands, apparently about November 10, 1973.) This sighting was first heard of after publication of the second edition of David Webb's 1973, Year of the Humanoids, in which it is mentioned on page 10 and is listed as having taken place in October of 1973. Gerard J. Kok of the Dutch Werkgroep NOBOVO managed to locate the witness, who had moved to Nijmegen. He talked to her on the phone, but did not get any more details than had been in David Webb's account. No further investigation was made. In Nhrch 1978,1 returned from the United States and decided to follow up on the case, more or less on request of Ted Bloecher. Everything that follows in this report is a result of this investigation unless noted otherwise. The witness has not been contacted by the press or by any other investigative agency as of June 26, 1978. At about 2:15 AM on a day in the fall of 1973 Mrs. -- had to get up and go to the bathroom, which was located at the front of the house. On her way there she glanced out of one of the front windows of the house and noticed something white. She did not pay too much attention, because she obviously had other things to do. When she returned from the bathroom she decided to have another look. Outside her house she saw three small beings, dressed in white garments, walking on the sidewalk in her direction. She kneeled down to have a better look at the three beings. Their white robes reminded her of monk's habits and they came all the way down to their proportionally large shoes. On their head they wore some sort of a hat, which came down in two points on their 12 shoulders and which seemed to be attached to the robes. She could not discern any facial features, because of the reflection of a nearby streetlight and, the full moon. Around their waist the beings seemed to have a belt to which several small instrument-like things were attached that reflected in the moonlight. Two of the beings were walking side by side and the third one was walking behind them. The front ones were approximately 3 feet tall, while the third one was slightly taller. They were slowly approaching the witness and while moving they did not lift their shoes off the ground, they just seemed to shuffle along. Because of the movements of the garments Mrs. -- got the distinct impression that the beings had relatively short legs. While walking they kept their legs stiff as if they did not have any knees. The being that was walking up front on the right side held some sort of an instrument in his hands, which reminded her of a carpet cleaner: The being moved the \"carpet cleaner\" from left to right and back over the sidewalk, covering several stones in each sweep. The other two just seemed to follow his movements. Mrs. --, with her nose against the window, did not feel very comfortable watching this strange scene, but her curiosity was stronger than her fear so she kept on looking. She thought of calling her husband, who was still asleep in the bedroom at the back of the house. She decided not to do so, because her husband has a very weak heart and she did not want to upset him by calling him in the middle of the night from the other side of the house. She had been watching the slowly approaching beings for some 4 or 5 minutes, when suddenly the tallest one seemed to notice her. He looked up at the window, where Mrs. -- was sitting and immediately they all turned around and shuffled away one after another. They now moved much faster than they had done before, but they still did not lift their feet off the ground. They went behind a nearby school building, but the witness could still follow them through two walls of glass. Then they disappeared from her view. She stood up and looked into the street to see whether there were any other strange beings. She did not see anything, so she went back to the bedroom at the back of the house. When she entered, her husband , woke up. For some unknown reason she glanced out of the bedroom window\" and she was very surprised to see a luminous red ball sitting on the sidewalk some 40 meters away. The ball was big enough to cover the complete sidewalk and had a diameter of several meters. It reminded her of the setting sun, but with the distinction that this ball was too bright to look into unlike a setting red sun. Mr. -- asked his wife what time it was, so they both looked at the alarm clock, which showed that it was 2:25 AM. When Mrs. -- looked out of the window again, the ball had disappeared. She told her husband what she had seen on the front side of the house and according to her husband she was visibly shaken by the experience. After a while they decided to go back to sleep. The next morning Mrs.- -- went over to . the local police station to report what she had seen, hoping that others would also come out supporting her story. Sighting Investigation I called Mrs. -- in the second week of March and set up a meeting at her home in Nijmegen for the 15th. At this meeting Mr. and Mrs. -- and I were present. A taped interview was made. Because of the nature of the sighting it did not seem worthwhile to do much more of a follow up. From March 15th to the present (June 26) there have"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"been a few conversations between the witness and the investigator. In the meantime I attempted to recover the police report that was possibly made of .Mrs. --'s statement, but these attempts have been unsuccessful so far. Within the next few weeks a final attempt will be made. At the time of the experience.the witness was 60 years old and in good health. She seems to be of normal intelligence, does not hold any other job than that of housewife. She was very open in her answers and refused to speculate about things that she was not sure about. She seemed completely sincere in everything she told and is the type of person that just does not try to perpetrate a hoax. She was still very puzzled about what she had experienced, but was convinced of the fact that she did see what she had described. She was not knowledgable on the subject of UFOs and is not particularly interested in it. In the 5 years that have elapsed between the sighting and the investigation she has told several friends about her experience, but has not attempted to gain anything by it in any respect as far as is known to the Investigator. It is through one of these friends that an account of her experience eventually reached David Webb. The friend made a tape of a conversation with Mrs. -- and sent this tape to his son in the United States, who is very interested in UFOs. The son sent a letter about this case to Dr. Hynek at the Center for UFO Studies, where the letter was forwarded to David Webb. It is my definite impression that Mrs. -- is completely sincere and does think that she has seen everything that has been described in this report. At the time of the sighting Uden was a town with approximately 26,000 inhabitants and the beings were seen in a densely'populated part of town. This investigator does not know of any natural or man-made phenomena that may account for the things observed by the witness. A hoax seems very improbable as well. Although the witness is not known to have had hallucinations in the past, this explanation can not be discounted completely. Qualifying this experience as a hallucination or some other psychological disorder would mean that the majority of all humanoid cases would have to be qualified the same way. Although it is always possible that eventually this turns out to be the only right thing to do, I do not possess any specific arguments to qualify this case as such. It has been impossible to determine the exact date of the Uden case, because the witness only knows that it took place in the fall of 1973. According to the witness it was full moon and this would indicate that the possible dates were October 12 and November 10. When asked about this, Mrs. -- immediately exclaimed, \"Oh, then it must have been November 10, because when I saw that red ball, I thought, If we would be one month further, it would have been a Christmas ball.\" Taking into account that a lot of people call it a full moon even when it is still two days before or after full moon, we may say that it is quite probable that the event took place on or around November 10, 1973. This date would place it at the latter part of the fall 1973 humanoid wave in the United States' and is therefore of considerable interest.

The cover of this glorified comic book announces: \"The first fully documented account exposing the awful danger from beyond.\" When I bought this slick, imaginatively illustrated volume at a reputable bookstore it was in the Science, not the Science Fiction, section; the salesman said he thought it was \"for real.\" In my opinion it is a sophomoric spoof (from what college?) which would be more at. home as a serial in MAD magazine than as a purportedly serious documentary..

By Morrey Allen On December 14, ' 1976, at approximately 4:30 PM, three young boys in Northridge, California, were in the back yard of Brian and Michael H.'s home. A third boy, Todd R., age 12, saw an unusual object in the sky. He called 14-year-old Brian's attention to it, and both called to 12-year-old Michael, who joined them. The object first appeared as a bright light moving from east to west along a straight line to the south of the witness. It appeared to be about half a mile away at an altitude of approximately 3,000 feet. It moved at a speed which the boys compared to a fast, high-flying jet. The object traveled to a point estimated to be over the intersection of Plummer and Tampa, 2 miles southwest of the observers' position. It then suddenly changed direction from west to northwest in what the boys later described as an \"impossible turn.\" After traveling a few seconds in this new direction, it stopped and hovered for a short time, then performed a surprising maneuver — a loop. By this time, the three boys had equipped themselves with a 6-power telescope, a pair of 7x50 binoculars, and a 150-power reflector telescope. With the optical aids, they could now see that what they were looking at was more than just a light. Through the telescopes and binoculars the object offered an elliptical silhouette in the horizontal aspect. It was bisected laterally by a thin, flat disc,' gray in color, the diameter of which was slightly greater 14 than the rest of the object. The boys likened the shape to two shallow bowls, one inverted over the other with a thin \"deck\" of larger diameter between them. This central deck was motionless when the UFO hovered, but spun very rapidly when the craft was in motion. The upper half of the UFO glowed brightly with a white light of the intensity of a strong, electric bulb. The lower half also glowed as from an inner light, but with a silver-gray color. Two beams of light, one red and one green, were directed down at divergent angles. These beams remained constant and unchanging throughout the sighting. The boys later told me that they believed the UFO never turned in any direction, since the green light was always to the east and the red always to the west during all the maneuvers they observed. The witnesses also observed what appeared to be four round hatches or portholes in the upper half of the UFO — two on the left and two on the right, as viewed from the H.'s yard. The boys offered no guess as to what these were, only that they were small, round dark areas that did not glow as the rest of the surface did. Additionally, they saw a larger round \"hatch\" so well- centered in the visible side of the UFO that it appeared to be bisected by the flat, disc, previously described. This hatch,.as it appeared, became invisible or was closed when the UFO was in motion. Michael H. drew a careful sketch of the object (Figure A). Observing with his 150-power telescope, this witness saw this \"hatch\" as an opening through which he could view a bit of the object's interior. The inside of the UFO seemed bathed in a soft golden light. He saw various instruments that reminded him of computers. Another feature he described as \"sort of a balance,\" since it featured a crossbar mounted at its center on a vertical post. This crossbar moved up and down like a balance beam, and had silvery, metallic-looking Figure A. — Sketch by Michael Hendricks immediately after sighting. Vertical line on right was to indicate size of smaller UFO compared to the larger. Smaller ovoid was drawn in as a better example. \\\" 'Mil Figure B. — Michael's sketch of \"apparatus\" seen inside UFO, details uncertain. They may have been \"dials and buttons and switches.\" spheres at each end (Figure B). To conclude the description of the UFO, the boys estimated it as being 40 to 60 feet diameter in its horizontal axis, and a third of that in the vertical axis. They agreed that a .22 caliber pellet"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"held at arm's length would cover.the- mysterious object. It seemed to be about 2 miles away and perhaps 3,000 feet in altitude. The boys watched the UFO for several minutes in shifts, during which Brian and Michael took turns running into the house to call their father, the police, and myself, to whom the boys were referred by the police. Mr. H. was at work about 5 miles to the south. Although he looked in the direction toward which the boys were directing him by phone, he saw nothing. It is entirely possible that buildings were in the way of his line-of-sight. I was farther away, in the North Hollywood area, and had the same luck. While Brian was in the house, the UFO suddenly flew swiftly to the east \"a few miles.\" This distance is in question because Michael and Todd are unsure at this point. The object made a quick turn to the north for a similar distance, another fast turn to the west, and finally another turn south and returned to the •• same area where it started. I[ In other words, it had flown a large square or rectangular pattern over the area to the east of the witnesses! At about this time, two military jets appeared from the north at approximately 5,000 feet altitude, apparently closing on the UFO. As they came to within about a mile of the object, the UFO suddenly flew toward J the south at very high speed. The jets apparently attempted to follow it for a few seconds, but by that time the UFO was out of sight. The jets then broke to the west and flew out of sight. Only a few seconds later, the UFO reappeared from the north at a much slower speed and returned to the same area. It will be remembered that it had disappeared to the south. It hovered a short while, then moved slowly in the direction of the witnesses, losing altitude. Before it had . come halfway, a larger UFO suddenly appeared from the east and at great speed closed on the first one. This larger, UFO rapidly flew a tight % circle around the first one and then stopped dead without slowing. This new object was approximately four times the size of the original UFO, but otherwise identical, except that the observers could see no open hatch. The two UFOs then maneuvered ... about for a few minutes, the larger one moving off and the smaller one following closely as if being towed. They did this several times, never traveling, far, and returning to approximately the same place to repeat the move in another direction. After about 10 minutes of these maneuvers, the smaller UFO moved under the larger one, and together they rose straight up and out of sight at an \"incredible speed.\" The departure speed was far in excess of anything possible by known jets, according to the witnesses. The ascent out of sight was accomplished in 1 or 2 seconds. \"They just disappeared,\" Brian, said. \"Just a streak,\" was Michael's comment. The sky was clear, with only a few high clouds at 20,000 feet. Therefore, the.craft apparently rose at least 20,000 feet within 2 seconds before it disappeared from view. The duration of the sighting was 35.rninutes. Trie complexity arid long-lived nature of the sighting; the remarkable detail idescribed on and inside the object(s), plus the fact that the three witnesses outlined virtually the same scene intrigued me enough to do some follow-up work.' Because of the age of the witnesses, I wanted to check their veracity and observing ability. I therefore returned to the H. home about a week later, stating that I had \"mislaid\". Michael's original sketch. I asked him to draw another one. With no. references whatsoever to check-on, Michael drew another, sketch, with identical. details 'tp his first drawing (Figure C). In my opinion Michael's second sketch counts well toward the veracity of the sighting and the truthfulness of the witnesses. At this second interview, the witnesses described .the same maneuvers which the object made, in spite of the r complex nature of these motions. At one point Michael quickly corrected me when I pretended to be reviewing the first interview arid read that the object moved to the west at a certain point. He interrupted to point out that the direction was east. In my opinion, the boys were reporting a real event which they had carefully observed, and the strange nature of which had impressed them greatly.

I met some of these fine people in a recent visit to the small town of Sbnora, California, which is located in a sparsely populated area of the Sierra foothills in north central California. Sonora is surrounded by small communities and townships in the heart of the Mother Lode gold country. I first met Marv Taylor in San Francisco in an auditorium where KGO's Al Collins, author Frank Edwards, (now deceased), and myself were giving a four-hour program on KSFO Radio from the auditorium stage that evening. Marv came up to the stage with a massive clippings scrapbook to show me, during one of the station breaks. As I recall, there were about 700 people in attendance that night. Marv and I became mutual UFO acquaintances from that time on and closer friends when he moved to Sonora a few years later, when he contacted me again with a renewed UFO interest. Realizing he had an exceptional and enthusiastic interest in investigation and P.R. work, I put in a request to Director Walt Andrus to make Taylor State Section Director, which he did. Marv has gathered together a talented group to work with him in his area, investigating the local sightings and doing an outstanding amount of P.R. work. He is and has been constantly giving UFO talks to local civic groups, and is planning a large lecture to include several prominent UFO personalities. He has drawn interest in the many surrounding towns and communities for miles around, by 16 MUFON float in Northern California. giving talks to various clubs and businessmen's associations. The \"MOTHER LODE ROUND UP DAYS\" was a particular challenge for Marv's group. They tackled the task of constructing a huge, elaborate \"float,\" depicting \"Close Encounters\" and the Devil's Tower with a large \"MUFON\" sign on the front of the truck. They won first prize in their class, and rightfully should have, judging from the $2,000 plus that the group spent and the 30 days and nights of diligent, painstaking work to construct it. The huge saucer rotated with flashing lights while music from \"Close Encounters\" played through a portable P.A. system. The aliens were depicted by Marv's children and other youngsters, and one of the members simulated Dr. Hynek. As if this effort were not enough, the group has put on booth displays of MUFON material at County Fairs in the vicinity, with considerable success. Increased memberships and orders for MUFON publications have been the worthwhile result. This was also done at the group's own personal expense. The Taylor-MUFON group is certainly to be commended for an outstanding and unselfish sense of duty. From all indications I observed, while visiting this unique group and their leader, the enthusiasm and plans for future goals are accelerating. I can only say that I am proud to have Taylor and his dedicated people in the Western States Region of MUFON. I sincerely hope his example will be an incentive and inspiration for other groups throughout the country to boost MUFON recognition as a credible and responsible investigating organization."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"1979 MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM IN SAN FRANCISCO i . \"Intensifying the Scientific Investigation of UFO Surveillance\" is the theme for the 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium to be held Saturday and Sunday, July 7 and 8, at the spacious Airport Marina Hotel at the San Francisco International Airport, 1380 Bayshore Highway, Burlingame, CA 94010; telephone (415) 347-5444.

Perhaps the reason is that many think UFOs have an extraterrestrial connection. Whether or not such an allegation is true, becoming knowledgable in the space sciences will certainly improve the quality of UFO investigations and our outlook on space in general. Young people definitely should be exposed to \"good science\" so they may have a firm foundation for their future lives. The latest issue of Air and Space, a publication of the Smithsonian Institution, identifies how Moon rocks can be borrowed for use in the classrooms of our schools. Moon rock samples brought back by our astronauts may be borrowed from NASA's Johnson Space Center (JSC) at no charge. With the lunar samples, NASA sends a 25-pound packet of literature, slides, audiotape, and film to help a teacher make the most of the loan. Before being entrusted with the Moon rocks, teachers must attend a briefing which often lasts for 3 hours. These are held at NASA Centers, are given by NASA Science Specialists, or are arranged in any area from which the NASA Centers receive a great number of inquiries. Designed for Grades 5 through 12, six samples come in plastic discs an inch thick and 6 inches in diameter. These can be studied under ordinary 10X-20X microscopes. Grades 13 and higher receive six thin slice samples in plastic to be studied with high power microscopes. Three booking offices are involved. All are at NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, 77058. Educators at planetariums and museums write to Charles Biggs, Mail Code AP-4. Teachers of Grades 5 through 12 write to James D.

Todd Zechel, Peter A. Gersten, and William H. Spaulding for their dedication in opening the door to a new source of UFO sighting reports previously treated^as classified material. Certain MUFON officers have contributed financial aid to help defray legal and court costs in this quest. Our hats are off to these people for their silent contributions. While we are passing out compliments for dedicated work, all of us at MUFON are indebted to Harold Fulton, Director for New Zealand, for the outstanding and superb job that he has done in New Zealand representing the Mutual UFO Network in the news media, during their recent rash of sightings. And in addition for forwarding a volume of newspaper clippings that Idabel Epperson reproduced and distributed to key people in the United States primarily on the UFO motion picture films.

When the bank originally refused payment, the Doctor when advised, promptly prepared a check on a U.S. Bank. Our MUFON Treasurer, who is President of the First National Bank of Seguin, Texas, has this advice to our foreign correspondents when transmitting funds for purchases, dues, or subscriptions. (1) In Canada, do not write checks against Canadian Savings Banks or Canadian Credit -Union Banks; use recognized Canadian Banks. (2) Do not send foregin currency from any country, since there is a severe service charge to exchange to U.S. currency. (3) A United States of American Postal Money Order (International Reissue) is the preferred form of payment. (4) If a check is made, it should be specifically identified for example: \"$7.00 in U.S. Dollars\" so the exchange or transfer costs will be paid for by the writer. (5) Payment by cash in U.S. dollars is acceptable. Recently, we received $10 in cash from a Japanese man living in the Nation of QATAR, who desired his symposium proceedings to be sent air mail. On February 21, 1979, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, MUFON State Director for Maryland and a Consultant, arrived back in the United States after spending several weeks in New Zealand- and Australia, interviewing the people who .had either visually observed, viewed on -radar, or photographed objects in New Zealand between Christmas 1978 and the New Year. He has requested that his findings not be released to the public until he is prepared to do so. His thorough investigation gave him reason to believe that the objects photographed could not be attributed to Venus, Jupiter, or other such astronomical bodies as he reported on Australian TV Channel 0.

Obviously, the companies that financed his trip will have first priority to this information. By the time that you read this message, everyone will have had an opportunity to see the NEWSWEEK magazine article with photographs on UFOs that was the feature story.
