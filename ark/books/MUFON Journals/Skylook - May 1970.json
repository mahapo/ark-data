By Frmk A. Hudson, Jr, ====--=--------------------------- ----- ----_--I-_I---------- To fully understand' the why's and whereforerts of the UFO situetion, we might have to begin right here on Earth. To- understand sonc~hing mysterious, we sometimes have to c!xpare the unknowns with ths kr~swr: ; in order to consolidate our, thoupl2ts into a workable theory, There has been hunan habitation on Earth for thousands of years, which -survived on basic materials, such as food, water, and sh?_eI.tc7, Only in this century has civilirz,ation begun '!gobbling up\" na2- :rz? :-3-. sources and strategic materials at zn alc~ming rate.

If tkr E.?~$?I survives another thousand years, ir?dustry and agriculture cf it?c'; ..-..- - iod will be concerned, and rnpy have to look elsewhere for zc?+?d mate--- ials for which they can find'no s~15stitute. This search mipi.!t not so f~r, in the future,. and may hpve eiready begun, A large ccppel- c:.? . pany in the west began operating e~r2v in this century di~ging ore iha.:; .produced 30% to 40%,copper, They are now pracessing ore that p-oduc?,: less than 2% copper. The \"crezml' has been skivmed off in the last 5'3 years. bv'e realize that strategic mzterials on Earth are not inexhaust- able, Our-geologists and geophysicists will heve to turn to tJhe nea-- ept possible source of new ,materizl, our Moon, The Moon may not be any richer in strategic meterials per square foot than the E?~th, bue it _could prove to be a vzluable backlog what will benefif; ..ankind as a whole when we become technicall-y able to t~p these resources, Using the above guidelines for compzrison, we can turn ow attention -to a ~ivi~ization Ghat is much older and further advanced th- cn our o:mo Where this civi1,ization might be located is. of little concern as-far - as this theory goes. We can underst3nd th~t age and technical ,advance- ment does create problems; mainly, the more advanced and expanded a - civilization becomes, the more natcal resources 2re used up, They must ha~e something 'to work with in order to survive, The develcpment of a sophistic?ted transportation system permitted this unknowil civili- zation to search fer and wide for n~eded materiels.
