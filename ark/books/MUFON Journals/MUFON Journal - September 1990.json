Not boring for a young reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, but just another day. Little did J. Bond Johnson realize that a photo assignment he was about to be handed would resurface and be the center of controversy over 40 years later. He was working the afternoon shift from 1 to 8. It was a morning paper, with principal editions going to press at midnight and 2 a.m., and an early edition known as \"the bulldog\" which hit the streets just before 9 p.m. Bond, a recently discharged cadet in the Ar- my Air Corps, was the kind of report- er who always kept a camera in the trunk of his car just in case it might be needed. He was proud of his recently purchased, new 4x5 Speedgraphic. The city editor saw Johnson around 4:00 in the afternoon as near as he can recall. Thinking back over 40 years trying to retrace your steps is not an easy task. However there were certain events that were to un- fold that would leave an indelible im- pression on him. Working with the key elements that Bond is absolutely unequivocal on, a reconstruction of the events of the assignment the city editor gave him is both possible and significant. The city editor asked if Bond had his camera with him. When he answered in the affirmative, he was then told to hurry out to General Ramey's office. The editor said that the wire services had a breaking story about those flying discs that had been seen in almost every state in the union. It seemed the Army had recovered a crashed disc in New Mex- ico and it was now over at Ramey's office. When Bond related this story to the authors through four interviews spanning several months he proved to be an excellent witness. If he had been crystal clear on all the natty details of 40 years ago he would have been somewhat suspect. But any young reporter in the postwar era who was given an assignment to go to the commanding general's office at Eighth Army Air Forces Headquar- ters, Fort Worth Army Air Field, wouldn't be likely to ever forget it. Nor would he be likely to ever forget what happened next. It took about 20 minutes to get over to Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey's office. Since Bond routinely covered the base for the paper, and was an officer in the Civil Air Patrol which held weekly activities there, he needed on- ly to show his press pass and head over to the general's office. What did strike him as peculiar was the fact that he was to go to a general's office to view a crashed disc. It would be stan- dard procedure to go to the base Public Information Officer (PIO), and be directed to a hangar or other area to view something — but to a general's office? When he entered the general's of- fice, he was met by Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey and his Chief of Staff, Col. Thomas Dubose. There was no one else in the relatively large office. On the floor in the middle of the room where the conference table had stood was a bunch of rather unimpressive debris. What struck Bond immediate- ly was an acrid odor, something like burned rubber, only there was no evidence of rubber in the room. Ly- ing on the carpet, partially on a long sheet of brown wrapping paper, were two kinds of debris. The larger quan- tity consisted of pieces of a gray foil- like material and what appeared to be sticks. The other material was a pile of black chunks no bigger than a fist. These chunks would best be des- cribed as looking like hard plastic to- day, but at the time Bond had never seen anything quite like it. Again, it is the things that are out of the ordinary that stick in one's mind. Bond couldn't imagine why a general would want this junk on his carpet. Bond touched the foil-like material and discovered that it was very light, but rigid, not like anything he was familiar with. He asked the general what it was and Ramey answered something to the effect that he didn't know what in hell it was. But Bond's objective was to get a picture and get it back to the paper as quickly as he could. His problem was there wasn't much of a photo op- portunity. He asked Gen. Ramey to kneel down on the other side of the debris, which he did, and propped up a piece of the foil-like material. He took that picture. He then asked Col. Dubose to join the general in the shot. Dubose sat in the chair closest to the general and held the propped-up piece. It is clear from the picture that they both smiled the self-conscious kind of a smile that this was an im- portant picture and that they were somehow more important for being in it. That was all the film Bond had with him and there didn't seem to be anything else he could do with the scene anyway. While hurrying back to the newspaper, another thing struck him as odd — why was Ramey in full MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"uniform with jacket and hat on in his office? Dubose had an open collar, no jacket and no hat, standard for being in an office. Johnson arrived back at the paper sometime after 5:00; a fact he is sure of because he recalls that the day shift had already left. There was a major flurry of activity at the paper. Two Associated Press technicians had ar- rived from Dallas with a portable wire photo transmitter to send these first- ever pictures of an actual flying disc. The phone lines were ringing with calls from all over the country want- ing exclusive rights to the photos. A call was put out to get the engraver and an artist back in so the paper could print the pictures in the morn- ing edition. Bond hurried into the dark room to print the pictures. So great was the rush to get them on the wire that the technicians took them wet in order to make rapidly ap- proaching East Coast deadlines. The pictures were transmitted. Weather Gadget? Then another bulletin came across the wire, as they had been doing con- tinually for the last few hours. This one spoiled all the fun. Ramey now says the flying disc was only a weather gadget. Soon the calls stopped. Bond went home. A weather gadget? There was no mention of this when Bond was there. When Bond saw the paper the next morning there were a number of things that were different from the wire stories the day before. Warrant Officer Irving Newton, a base weather officer, had entered the picture. Bond hadn't heard his name before. Also he hadn't seen or heard of Major Marcel while he was there. Maj. Marcel was the Roswell Intelligence Officer that the first wire stories said was loaning the crashed disc to \"higher head- quarters.\" The events in Roswell leading up to the events in Fort Worth and the conclusion with the weather balloon story have been covered in great detail in the ongoing research by Moore and associates (see The Roswell Incident, etc.). But Bond Johnson's revelations open bigger questions about what has been refer- red to as the balloon \"cover story.\" It has been thought that Gen. Ramey was quick to reach the balloon story, and why not? If all the other amply qualified individuals couldn't recognize this so-called weather balloon and its radar target, then sure- ly Ramey and his staff could lay it to rest immediately. But Ramey went to the curious lengths of bringing it to his office, and having his picture taken with it. Why? Bond maintains that if Ramey or anyone else had said that it was a weather gadget of any sort lying there on the floor, he wouldn't have taken any pictures. There wouldn't have been any need to; it would have been a non-story and laid to rest quickly. Were these ranking military men honestly fooled by what Newton described as a garden varie- ty weather balloon of a type that is launched hundreds of times daily by both military and civilian weather sta- tions across the country? Not hardly. It is equally unlikely that it would have been misidentified in Roswell. Roswell Army Air Field had a rather elite group stationed there. After all, it was the only atomic bomber wing in the world. Curiously enough, Marcel is not in- terviewed by any press in any of the dozens of papers we scoured. The story first shows up on July 8, in those papers that went to press in the western states with an evening edition whose deadline coincided with the wire service story. Those papers car- ried on the front page the original press release from Lt. Walter Haut, PIO at Roswell. In effect, the story was that the Army Air Forces (A.A.F.) had captured a crashed flying disc. The story was carried by considerably more papers by the morning of the 9th. But this time it is the story that all that was found was a weather balloon. What happened? How was this mistake made? Why were so many additional papers that hadn't carried the story the day before will- ing to run the weather balloon story on the front page? A s would be expected, the story that a flying disc had been found (the term flying saucer hadn't quite come into vogue yet), would cause quite a stir in the press. After all, this was coming toward the end of an intense two-week period of sightings from all over the country and the world. The phone lines into the Roswell base were jammed, as were the calls to the sheriff (George Wilcox) who had made the initial report to the base. Ac- cording to Moore's interview with the editor of the Roswell Dispatch, the calls began around 2:00 the afternoon of the 8th. Reporters wanted to talk to anyone who knew anything. Using that 2:00 time in Roswell as an indicator of when the story broke wide on the AP wire, that would mean that it would have been 3:00 in Fort Worth. During the ensuing hour the wire services must have hounded every source they could to find the disc and get details. By the time the first story broke on the wires the debris had already been escorted under guard to Fort Worth. But the press didn't know where yet. The first story only said \"higher headquarters.\" According to the Dallas Morning News, July 9th: \"After the announce- ment, the alleged disk disappeared for an hour or so.\" According to num- erous reports and covered in The Roswell Incident by Berlitz and Moore, Lt. Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, deputy chief of air staff of the Army Air Forces, and at that moment, act- ing chief, \"hurried to the A.A.F. press section in Washington to take active charge of gathering news of the new disk find.\" This according to AP. So from that 2 o'clock hour in Roswell the press was chasing, while the phone lines between Washington, New Mex- ico and Texas were heating up with \"high level stuff.\" Finally, by about 3 o'clock Roswell time a wire story carried the location of the disc. Focus suddenly shifted to Fort Worth and Ramey's office. That would be the wire story (4:00 in Fort Worth) that the city editor at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram saw, hence his sending Bond Johnson over to get a MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Brig.

Based on Johnson's availability and his close proximity to the base, it's perfectly logical to assume that Bond was the first reporter to arrive at the base. Also in support of Johnson's story, the authors have come across a microfilm copy of the Los Angeles Evening Herald Express. This particular edition is very significant in that it is the Sunset Edition of July 8, 1947. Unlike the regular evening edition of the paper, which even by West Coast time (an hour earlier than Roswell), would have had only the original release, this paper had some updated news. The Sunset Edition would have come out several hours after the main edition with updated stories mainly on the front page. This kind of updated edi- tion would normally be only for newsstand sales. There on the front page were no less than three stories on the Roswell disc. One notable story had been posted by the Associated Press, dateline Washington, July 8: Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey said to- day that a battered object which previously had been described as a flying disc, found near Roswell, N.M., is being shipped by air to the A.A.F. research center at Wright Field, Ohio. Ramey, commander of the Eighth Air Force with headquarters at Fort Worth, received the object from the Roswell Army Air Base. In talking by telephone to A.A.F. headquarters at Washington, Ramey described the object as of \"flimsy con- struction, almost like a box kite.\" It was so badly battered that Ramey was unable to say whether it had a disc form. He did not indicate the size of the object. There were \"some fragments of junk\" found near the object near the New Mexico ranch where a rancher sighted it last week. Ramey reported that so far as the A.A.F. investigation could determine, no one had seen the object in the air. Asked what the material seemed to be, A.A.F. officials here said that Ramey described it as \"apparently some sort of tin foil.\" The object, after being found by the rancher, was turned over to the 509th armoured group at Roswell Airfield. When asked if other agencies, in- cluding the F.B.I., would examine the exhibit, A.A.F. officials said they understood that if the airplane carry- ing the material had not left Fort Worth up to now the F.B.I, represen- tatives in that area might make an examination. Clearly Ramey didn't know what it was. To say \"some sort of tin foil,\" would indicate that it had character- istics like tin foil, but it wasn't tin foil. Since the military didn't have anything of this nature, he couldn't identify it any more than the brass in Roswell could. Undoubtedly some radio sta- tions were carrying the updated bulletins, but there were no all-news stations in 1947. Television was not in every home. Newspapers were still sold from corners with newsboys shouting \"read all about it.\" The point here being that major stories generally broke in major newspapers. This ac- tivity was happening between deadlines of almost every major newspaper. The public had an inkling of this story, but it was the press that was developing a head of steam ready to explode it. A bulletin from International News Service (INS) placed just above the Ramey AP story in the Los Angeles Evening Herald Express with a dateline of Fort Worth, July 8, read: Brig. Gen. Roger Ramey com- manding general of the Eighth Army airforces field, asserted tonight the purported \"flying disc\" found in eastern New Mexico is \"evidently nothing other than a weather or radar instrument of some sort.\" This appears to be the beginning of what is considered a cover-up. A se- cond bulletin just below the one above, again from INS, this time dateline Denver, July 8, read: Senator Ed C. Johnson, of Col- orado, told the Denver Post by long distance from Washington today that the object found in New Mexico may have been \"either a radar target or a meterological balloon.\" It's rather amazing how a senator in Washington, who never saw the material, could be so much smarter than those handling it whose job it was to know such things. The INS bulletins must have just come over the wire as this edition was going to press and after the AP story out of Washington. But how did Ramey suddenly figure it out? And more im- portantly, how could Ramey square the weather device line with his own statement to A.A.F. headquarters, as reported by John G. Norris of the Washington Post on July 9th? Norris had been tracking the story and reported that on July 8th, when Ramey had gotten a look at the material, it was about 25 feet in diameter, and he was shipping it on to Wright Field for examination. Now the Herald Express had another AP story that was essentially the original press release, but with some updated information. It seems the AP boys had been banging on a lot of doors and come up with this, dateline Roswell, July 8: Later the A.A.F. said that further in- formation indicated the object would have had a diameter of about 20 to 25 feet if reconstructed. Nothing in the apparent construc- tion \"indicated any capacity for speed\" and there was no evidence of a power plant, the A.A.F. said. Construction of the disc seemed too flimsy to have enabled it to carry a man, it was added. N ext Newton, the meteor- ologist, was quoted as say- ing that it was a typical weather balloon measuring about 50 inches in diameter, weighing about 100 grams. 100 grams? On a metric equivalents chart, 100 grams equals 3.527 ounces. According to Newton, his balloon would carry a radar target device that was made of tin foil stapled to a thin wood frame. It would be silvery like a six-pointed star. By a process of triangulation the winds aloft are charted. By best estimates these target devices measure about 5 feet from point to point. To batter one of these devices you would have nothing more than a burst balloon and torn tin foil and MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 Major Jesse A.

Any five-year-old could iden- tify it, even if he didn't know what it was for. That same five-year-old could put the remains in his Red-Flyer wagon. In fact, the apparatus would break down so easily that anyone could break it up and stuff it in an average shopping bag. This isn't what generals get excited over. In Moore's interview with Newton (The Roswell Incident), he makes it clear that he was ordered to come to Ramey's office to identify a weather balloon. He was briefed, then met the reporters that were there with a torn balloon that was handed to him. It's important to note that he was not called in to examine debris to deter- mine if he knew what it was; he was told up front what to say, and he was also ordered not to answer any ques- tions. What he identified was handed to him, it was not what was on Ramey's floor. But at what point did this occur? He stated that he was alone on his shift when he received word that the general had personally ordered him to leave his post. That would put him on the second shift and place the time after 6:00 — three hours from the time the first story hit the wires. But Newton wasn't the first to tell the press the weather balloon story. According to the Dallas Morning News, July 9, Maj. E.M. Kirton, In- telligence Officer at Fort Worth Army Air Field, gave the whole weather balloon/radar device story to their reporter at 5:30 p.m. The article ends by quoting Newton from a later AP dispatch. Maj. Kirton was also the one interfacing with the F.B.I. If the intelligence officer could iden- tify the debris why did Newton have to be ordered over? Something hap- pened to cause the military to do an about face. The Washington Post even reports a temporary news blackout was clamped on Roswell. Why? If the material had been shifted to Fort Worth, what difference did it make what Roswell was saying? For three hours the press was having a field day monitoring the goings-on between New Mexico and Texas and Washington. It would have been in- teresting to have seen all the wire traf- fic as the story was constantly up- dated. By choosing a lowly warrant officer to front the cover story for the wire services, it would help in play- ing down the story. Newton and his story were nowhere around when Bond Johnson took his pictures. Lead Foil Sitting in Johnson's living room go- ing over the photographs and several clippings he has, a number of facts emerged. There were at least six pic- tures taken of individuals with the debris in Ramey's office. The first thing that strikes you is that the material is unimpressive. In fact, until you look at full 8x10 blow-ups of some of the negatives with a magnifying glass, you don't realize that the material on the floor holds its shape. This gives credence to the statements that the pieces, unlike tin foil, were stiff. This was said by every individual who handled the material, including Johnson. The material in the photograph is not highly reflective, and every person who handled it described it as gray, or \"like a lead foil.\" No one described it as highly reflective. Yet every description of the target device it was supposed to be characterizes such devices as \"silvery\" and highly reflective. Continued examination of the photographs, even those that we on- ly had from newspaper photocopies, reveals that all six photos were taken in the same room with the same debris. It is actually possible to match up certain common shapes in each photo. But if Bond had been there before the cover story set in, and if, as has been suggested, an actual weather device was brought in to replace it, then why would the pic- tures that were obviously taken after Bond show the same debris? Curious- ly enough, this fact supports Bond's story. Bond took his two pictures and left. The AP was so anxious to get these pictures that they set up a port- able wire machine, from Dallas — not an effort they would likely go to for a weather balloon. The pictures hit the wire. Then the cover story sets in. But they can't retrieve the pictures. The only advantage they have is that the debris looks ordinary. So, they allow additional pictures to be taken by the now growing press contingent on the base. But it is clear that others were not accorded the same access that Bond was. In his interview with Moore (The Roswell Incident) Maj. Marcel main- tained that the debris in the two photos with him is the real stuff. But, he states that the reporter that took them was allowed in the room 'only far enough to take the pictures. He was not allowed to touch the stuff, and he was then taken out of the room. Marcel, for his part, was not allowed to talk to the reporters, and was ultimately ordered back to Roswell. A second picture of Ramey and Dubose was taken and this time they weren't smiling. They looked very grim. This last photo, along with one of Newton, were taken by a United Press photographer. Marcel maintained that the more impressive debris remained on the plane under guard, ready to go on to Wright Field. He did not get to accompany it. There exists a fascinating contrast in the AP story carried in the Los Angeles Times of July 9, 1947. There is Newton's weather balloon story, with the 100 gram balloon, and a lit- tle further on the fact that the device was scattered over a square mile of the ranch. Every witness to the scene of recovery described the debris as covering a very large area. That debris was not the device that Newton described to the press. Having been ordered away from his post by a general, briefed by a colonel, being told that an object had been found by a major which the general had de- cided was a weather balloon and which he was to identify as such for reporters, being handed a torn balloon in front of reporters but with specific instructions not to answer their questions, and not having heard anything about the flying disc story before, must have been quite mind- boggling for the poor fellow. But Newton played the part well and stuck MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 to what he had been told to do, which was to identify a device he was allegedly familiar with. He never questioned what was on the floor of the general's office, even when he had his picture taken with it. Why should he? He was outranked and in good company. He was then sent on, left to ponder what it might all have been about. Of added note here is another less heralded story by the AP, datelined Washington, July 8. It reads in part. Army weather experts in Wash- ington discount any idea that such weather targets might be the basis for the scores of reports of \"flying discs.\" Brig. Gen. Donald N. Yates, Chief of the A.A.F. Weather Service, said during the war the radar target method of wind checking was stan- dard practice because of the high degree of accuracy needed. The Weather Bureau said it uses none of the radar target balloons at land stations. Some are used from Coast Guard vessels in the Atlantic, Bureau officials said, but they normal- ly blow eastward toward Europe. Between the Army and the Weather Bureau, hundreds of weather balloons without the metallic target are released daily from points all over the country. For ordinary purposes, Gen. Yates told a reporter, the A.A.F. uses balloon-borne radio sondes much on the order employed by the Weather Bureau, tracking them with radio direction finders. Those instruments consist of a milky-way balloon five or six feet in diameter with the automatic radio transmitting apparatus suspended below in a package about cigar box size. Well, so Newton was a little off. At least he was close and the general was satisfied with his performance. So many stories to post, so much com- petition, so little time. The military bravely protected the nation during the war, why would they lie to the public now? There were other break- ing stories to cover. After all, the stuff on the general's floor looked like a bunch of junk. It just wasn't exotic enough looking to capture the im- agination of the media. It seems clear that Bond's story holds up and sheds new light on the events. The photographs show the actual debris from the flying disc from Roswell. Ramey had on his full uniform because he knew the press would want to take pictures. Why else would he have the stuff brought to his office? So many papers carried the story the following morning because the editors had been following the events coming over the wire and the fact that many radio stations had car- ried it the day before. Ramey even went on the radio (see The Roswell Incident) to throw water on the disc story! No one ever challenged him on the \"25 feet in diameter\" statement. It got lost in the rush. There were numerous press people around, but he chose to use the radio as a way of avoiding an actual press con- ference. But why the change? Why the need to suddenly stop the interest? P erhaps the answer is in the controversial Eisenhower Briefing Document (one of the MJ-12 documents). The discovery (by Shandera) in 1990 of the Herald Express story is extreme- ly important in that it shows for the first time that statements were com- ing out of Roswell that relate directly to statements made in that document (for example, the curious references in both sources to the apparent lack of a power plant in the wreckage). The Eisenhower Briefing Document also states that on July 7, a secret operation was begun to assure recovery of the wreckage in Roswell for scientific study. That is the same day that the first pieces of debris gathered by Marcel and Cavitt arrived at the Roswell base. It seems likely that Ramey was informed that same evening, and through him, head- quarters in Washington. AP states in one story that the crashed disc was flown to Fort Worth from Roswell at 10:00 a.m. the morning of the 8th. It's not out of the question that Ramey, or even Vandenberg ap- proved the first press release. The cover story also contained the state- ment that the PIO at Roswell, Walter Haut, was strongly rebuked for the release. Haut, however, strongly denies that. The Eisenhower Briefing Docu- ment goes on to say that: During the course of this operation, aerial reconnaissance discovered that four small human-like beings had ap- parently ejected from the craft at some point before it exploded. These had fallen to earth about two miles east of the wreckage site. All four were dead and badly decomposed due to action by predators and exposure to the elements during the approximately one week time period which had elapsed before their discovery. Since the explosion and crash hap- pened on July 2, it could well have been that the bodies were confirmed on the afternoon of July 8, approx- imately one week later. It could also be that strange metallic debris was ex- citing to the military and press — but bodies were a whole different matter. When that discovery was made, Washington ordered Ramey to get the reporters off the story in a hurry. Shut it down. Hence the illogical weather balloon story was just another crazy conclusion to another flying disc story, most of which were not being treated very seriously at the time anyway in the public media. The press bought it and moved on. Today, J. Bond Johnson, PhD, is a clinical psychologist who makes his home with his wife in Southern California. His career has been ex- emplary. He has a degree in jour- nalism, spent 18 years as an ordained United Methodist minister, and holds both masters and doctorate degrees in psychology. He is also a retired U.S. Army colonel who worked as a psychological operations expert for the National Security Council under Gen. Scowcroft, Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig.

Brandenburg, Ph.D. Dr. Brandenburg is a MUFON Consultant in Plasma Physics. It has been nearly a half century since UFO phenomena became a continuing topic of public discourse. It seems likely that the beginning of this period coincided with the initia- tion of significant levels of contact by one group of extraterrestrials, the Reticulians, with humanity. This group reportedly originates in the Zeta Reticuli system, 1 hence the name Reticulian, and is reportedly one of the many ET groups now in some degree of contact with humani- ty. Based on reports, it appears Reticulians consist of a spectrum of types generally characterized by (relative to humans) short stature, large crania and eyes, and simple or vestigial exterior forms corresponding to human mouth, nose and ear struc- tures. This general type of Reticulian ET dominates abductee accounts and crash reports, most notably the Roswell crash. Because of the ap- parent long-standing Reticulian presence at Earth, it seems reasonable to entertain hypotheses as to Reticulian goals or intentions towards humanity. A hypothesis was formed two years ago by the author, but aside from presentation to the executive commit- tee of the Fund for UFO Research, it was not publicized. In brief, this hypothesis states: Reticulian inten- tions are that, within a century or less, Reticulian-human hybrid beings will be the sole intelligent inhabitants of the Earth. Independently, a very similar scien- tific hypothesis was arrived at by an eminent figure in Ufology, Don Ware, during the same period. Don's hy- pothesis was summarized by him dur- ing the Sunday panel discussion at the 1990 MUFON Symposium. However, Don Ware and the author have very different moral interpreta- tions of the hypothetical Reticulian in- tentions. In the author's version of this hypothesis, the intentions of the Reticulians are quite hostile to humanity, since they involve coloniza- tion of the Earth at humanity's ex- pense. However, since possible ET hostility presents its own set of prob- lems, it is appropriate to examine the general problem of hostile alien scenarios before discussing the hypothesis. Discussion of hostile alien scenarios is somewhat circumscribed within Ufology. In addition to the fact that such scenarios are unpleasant, the limitation of discussion seems to stem from two principal factors: (1) The absence of overt alien attack. (2) The assumption of human helplessness and insignificance in the face of ET contact. This latter assumption is, in the author's view, a fallacy, and will be subsequently referred to as the Fallacy Of Obvious Human Insignif- icance, or FOOHI (or \"phooee\"). In the author's view, FOOHI is an actual fallacy because it is inconsistent with both scientific analysis and large numbers of reports of human-ET en- counters. Scientifically, any being of flesh and blood will recognize its own destruction as possible and as some- thing to be avoided. In addition, an attribute of intelligent beings is the ability to recognize and desire com- munication with other intelligent be- ings. For this reason, humans regard sharks, tigers and dolphins as having significant presences, despite the fact that humanity possesses enormous technological advantages over these species. Likewise, intelligent beings riding in ships composed of elements of the periodic table, recognize that all these elements have finite strengths and that these strengths can be easily exceeded during any number of accidental or intentional occurrences possible at Earth. In addition, any scientifically capable beings, journeying through the beautiful vastness of space, would recognize that next to this vastness, humanity, the Earth, their own alien homeworld, and they themselves, are less than dust. Thus they would know, even if they would not admit it, that a human is as significant a being as themselves, to be both feared and respected. The results of this analysis are reflected in accounts of ET contact. ETs seem to view humans with a curious mixture of kindness, con- tempt and barely disguised fear, but not indifference. Abductees, on rare occasions, have been treated respect- fully and as true fellow beings. Ab- ductees commonly detect fear among Reticulians they encounter. This is reinforced by reports that UFOs either flee or take defensive actions against armed jet fighters and ETs regularly flee armed humans on the ground. Finally, it can be said that the whole UFO experience seems to demon- strate human significance, by the fact that it represents the long term efforts by several ET groups to both demonstrate presence and power, yet carefully manage contact and human perceptions. One does not carefully manage contact or arrange displays of power for beings one considers unimportant. Therefore, FOOHI is a fallacy, and human capabilities to in- fluence events involving ETs are an important, perhaps pivotal factor in human-ET encounters. This means all MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 human perceptions of ET actions must be carefully examined. In a living and complex universe not everything is as it seems, and any scenario not forbidden by the laws of physics (not just laws known by humans) must be considered. Among these are hostile alien scenarios in which human actions are an important factor, and ET actions are deceptive. Hostile? Hostile alien scenarios are com- monly dismissed by the statement: \"If the ETs were hostile they would simply attack, since we would be powerless to stop them.\" Since the ETs have not attacked, this line of logic goes, they must be benevolent. However, this line of reasoning is based on FOOHI, the false assumption of human helpless- ness. Humans are not helpless, how- ever, and this makes things much more complicated and subtle. If ETs actually regarded the pros- pect of full scale war at Earth with some dread, fearing heavy casualties, even from less advanced human weapons, possible nuclear war that would destroy the Earth and humani- ty rather than resulting in its capture, or even some ET groups choosing to help Earth, leading to interstellar war, then even hostile ETs would tread carefully at Earth and seek to avoid open hostilities at all costs. This would mean ET hostility would be manifest as treachery and deception rather than open attack. Science fiction has already ex- plored several hostile alien scenarios. The most famous of these, and one which appears to have influenced both scientific and government think- ing is H.G. Wells War of The Worlds. It will be recollected that this scenario involved a massive and violent attack by the Martians utilizing heat rays and poison gas. The Martians utilized humans as a food source, and routed the human military, despite the fact that artillery and naval gunfire was ef- fective against the Martian war machines. In general, it was the psychological collapse and lack of organization or even comprehension This colonization is to be achieved by treachery, stealth, intimidation and terror rather than open warfare, since such warfare might lead to unpredictable outcomes. of the Martian invasion that made resistance so ineffective. Of course, the Martian attack ultimately failed due to Earth bacteria, to which the Martians had no resistance. The potential vulnerability of advanced alien organisms to native bacteria can be termed the \"biphazard\" problem and has even influenced our own government's policy\\ In fact, this bio- hazard problem dictated' elaborate quarantine procedures for returning Apollo astronauts. \\ A means around the biohazard hur- dle would be for the inwacjing aliens to initiate \"genetic fusion\"' 1 with ad- vanced native organisms.^Inithis way the immune systems ,ofi native organisms could be transplanted into the aliens' genetic material, offering them a broad spectrum vaccination against native infections. Such genetic fusion concepts have also been ex- plored in hostile alien scenarios. Genetic fusion occurs as a major'plot element in the classic 1956 rr\\ovie \"In- vasion of the Body SnatcherS)\" and its remake, and the classic sciences fiction story, \"Who Goes There?\" by John Campbell, which inspired two movie versions of \"The Thing\" (1951,J1982). In the latter story a frozen, alien, recovered from a crashed sai;icer in Antarctica, is thawed out and goes on a homicidal rampage. In bo^h Ithe original story and the 1982 version, the rampage involves genetic 'fusion with human beings. Unlike the \\/Var of the Worlds scenario, both the cenetic fusion scenarios involved stealthy alien attacks on individual humans .rather than mass destruction, and invasions that are well underway before' being discovered, like a smallpox epidemic. Science fiction has often been pro- phetic, and perhaps speaks to bur pre- sent situation. Summary and Hypothesis / The salient features ofour present situation can be briefly summarized: • The Reticulians have arrived, ap- parently traveling many light years, in large numbers and on many ships. They have lost many ships, and have stayed here 40 years. • The Reticulians have abducted many humans and their actions in- dicate a complete disregard for human values, rights or dignity. • The Reticulians have made the abductees part of experiments to create Reticulian-human hybrid beings. • The Reticulians have mutilated many cattle and apparently recovered blood and other tissues, suggesting they are nourishing some life form. • The Earth is probably a rare plan- et, a living planet orbiting a stable star. • The Reticulian presence is pro- gressive, beginning with sightings, then landings, followed by abductions and cattle mutilations and now perhaps the establishment of bases. • The Reticulians seem to be pur- suing a well planned course of action, yet they will give no logical or verifiable 2 goal for their efforts to any human. When the scope and duration of the Reticulian activities here are con- sidered, it seems probable they are after some extremely valuable goal in order to justify this high level of effort and resources. The fact they will not disclose a sensible goal for this effort suggests that humans would probably oppose this effort if they knew its real nature, and that concealing this goal will prevent human interference in their efforts to achieve it. In the author's view, these con- siderations restrict the range of useful hypotheses of Reticulian intentions to those that involve shared human- Reticulian needs and which are con- trary to human interests. The most ob- vious shared needs between humans and Reticulians are the resources and environments vital to biological sur- vival. Therefore, a hypothesis can MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"13 be formed that is consistent with what is reported. The hypothesis: The Reticulians in- tend that within a century or less, Reticulian-human hybrids will be the only intelligent life form on this planet. Hybrids are used for colonization to avoid biohazard problems. This col- onization is to be achieved by treachery, stealth, intimidation and ter- ror rather than open warfare, since such warfare might lead to unpredict- able outcomes. Hybrid occupation of the planet is to be exclusive since this is most efficient and humans are too dangerous and territorial to allow a shared existence. The hybrid beings will be nourished on native nutrients. Ironically, under this hypothesis, a government policy of secrecy, in- tended to protect public morale, unintentionally assists the Reticulian's efforts. A government coverup allows the Reticulian presence to be con- tinually wrapped in mystery and fear rather than being discussed as a mat- ter of public and scientific concern. Ad- ditionally, a coverup aids the Reticulian intentions under this hypothesis, because it insulates the government from public pressure to stop Reticulian activities that are vital to their inten- tions: continued abductions, to gain genetic diversity for the hybrids, and animal mutiliations to provide nutrients. The government need not even attempt to deal with situations that are not publicly known. However, if this hypothesis is correct, the ending of a government coyerup by vigorous and professional efforts in Ufology would severely handicap Reticulian plans. This would be good. The hypothesized Reticulian inten- tion, if accomplished, would be a gross violation of the principles set out in the Rainbow Declaration, 3 most notably the right of possession of homeworld. The accomplishment of this hypo- thetical intention would also constitute genocide. Under this hypothesis, Reticulian intentions are merely ter- ritorial appropriation and replacement of a native species with one that is of predominately Reticulian heritage, to no higher end than biological self- interest. On Earth, the modem man- ifestation of such all consuming racial or tribal self-interest is termed Nazism. In the Reticulians, we may be seeing its extraterrestrial manifestation. The fact that this hypothesis could be formed, based on what is common- ly reported in Ufology, is quite sober- ing. It suggests that Ufologists every- where should redouble their efforts to make UFO phenomena a credible and scientifically accepted matter of public discussion. In addition, it suggests that discussions of alien means and ends should be intensified and widened to include all possibilities, not just benevolent ones. It also means that the human factor in these scenarios must be re-examined. Assuming human insignificance is not only a fallacy, in the author's view, it is also seductive. Nothing is required of people who are helpless. They can sit back and watch events rather than risking ridicule, or anything else, by try- ing to influence them. Let us move on from a simple universe where we are bystanders in our own destiny, into a messy, complex cosmos, where humanity, and its intentions, are things to be reckoned with. So let the debate be joined, let us advance beyond the statement: \"The Space Brothers? ... Hostile? ... Phooee!\" Notes 1. Terence Dickenson, \"The Zeta Reticuli In- cident,\" p. 7, Astromedia Corp. (Publishers of Astronomy Magazine) Milwaukee, Wisconsin (1976). 2. Typical of Reticulian rationales for com- ing to Earth, given to abductees, are \"We saw a glow\" in Transformation by Whitley Streiber p 84, and in The Watchers by Raymond E. Fowler p 348-349, where aliens (of the Reticulian type) are said to be at Earth as \"caretakers,\" essentially here to help since \"Man was going to become sterile.\" However, this ex- planation seems ironic given humanity's over- population problems. 3.

Schuessler Abduction researcher Budd Hopkins describes instances of ap- parent nasal cavity implants in his books Missing Time and Intruders. In one of these cases a mother described a probe being inserted in her daugh- ter's nose. She said there was \"a little ball\" on the end of the probe. The ball was \"smaller than a BB.\" She was quite distressed when the probe was removed and the ball was not. In his book The Watchers, Ray- mond Fowler describes how the alien doctors used a long flexible needle to retrieve an object from the nose of Betty Andreasson. He said the object \"was the size of a BB and seemed to have tiny wires sticking out of it.\" In the same book, Fowler quotes the work of Dr. Richard Neal, Jr. on the subject of implants. Dr. Neal says \"many abductees have described a thin probe with a tiny ball on its end being inserted into the nostril — usually on the right side. They are able to hear a \"crushing\" type sound as the bone in this area is apparently being penetrated. Many will have nosebleeds following these examina- tions.\" During the 1990 MUFON Sym- posium held in Pensacola, Florida, I was privileged to meet with a number of individuals claiming various ex- periences with implants. One in- dividual shared the results of laboratory tests on a device he be- lieved to be an implant which had been expelled from his nasal cavity. The results appeared to compare favorably with the laboratory analysis of another individual's expelled im- plant. This was not a wild claim on his part, as he had the results of the laboratory work in hand. This data will not be released until the research is completed. A researcher from Kansas has shared information about his four year quest for information in a specific case involving implants. He says he had evidence that the implants are found in a number of organs, including the brain. He says that this evidence has converted him from skeptic to serious researcher. The implants seem to be used for monitoring and commun- ication. UFO abductions have been in- vestigated by only a few serious researchers. Those individuals have discovered, among other interesting things, that implants do appear to ex- ist as I have noted in the previous paragraphs. They have found it dif- ficult to get other researchers to do lit- tle more than armchair investigations to verify or reject their claims. Is it any wonder that they express disappoint- ment and irritation at the lack of pro- gress that has been made in this field? In \"The Implant Enigma\" (Part I), I described the work of some British scientists and their report of finding a mystery object amid the chromo- somes. The other was many times smaller than the alleged UFO im- plants; but this tiny object had been spotted in the laboratory. My point was that scientists find and identify strange anomalies on a continuing basis. Why not apply the same techni- ques to locating and identifying UFO artifacts located anywhere in the human body? The mystery object among the chromosomes was iden- tified in a letter from a group of scien- tists at the New Mexico School of Medicine in the October 30, 1986 issue of Nature as follows. \"The mystery object in Wolsten- holme's chromosome preparation is a fragment of the silica skeleton of an alga known as a diatom. We had significant problems with contamina- tion from this tiny organism's remains for several years. Eventually we ac- cidentally discovered that the source of the contamination was diatoma- ceous particles from rubber bulbs placed on Pasteur pipettes, used for the harvesting phase of chromosome preparations. Diatomaceous earth is apparently used by some manufac- turers in the production of rubber goods. \"Diatom particles clung to many cells, cutting their membranes and releasing the contents (in the same manner that diatomaceous earth is used as an organic insecticide). This diminished the numbers of well- spread chromosome metaphases. The particularly vulnerable cells in this procedure were those in metaphase (and therefore without a nuclear membrane) which were under inter- nal osmotic pressure due to prior hypotonic treatment. The greater the dose of diatomaceous fragments, the more cells in metaphase that were af- fected ...\" This answer seems plausible to me and it strengthens my belief that we can identify and analyze UFO im- plants (if they exist). One reader of the MUFON UFO Journal, Rich Clark of Berkeley, California, provided addi- tional verification that the British mystery is solved. He referred to let- ters in the October 23, 1986 issue of Nature as well as the October 30 issue. Rich says \"my first thought was that it likely was a hoax, possibly a prank engineered by the lab techni- cians ...\" After some reflection, he reviewed the contents of the various letters to Nature and agreed with the concensus of the writers, \"that the ob- ject was a piece of the silica skeleton of a diatom, which possess that kind of regular square pattern. Blacked-in squares may have been caused by air bubbles retained during the process of mounting the slide. The source could have been lab equipment since diatomite is used in lab filters and in the manufacture of rubber goods.\" Continued on page 22 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The UFO Press Out There, by Howard Blum, Simon & Schuster, hb, 300 pp., $19.95 Reviewed by Dennis Stacy 15 Out There, has been eagerly an- ticipated within some circles of ufology. Subtitled \"The Government's Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials,\" it was hoped that Blum's book might finally blow the lid off the govern- ment's covert UFO policy. Moreover, it was written by an outsider, a well- respected investigative reporter, formerly with The New York Times, twice nominated by his editors for the Pulitzer Prize, and the author of Wanted! The Search for Nazis in America and / Pledge Allegiance ... The True Story of the Walker Spy Family. While I hope that much good may yet come of it, it also pains me to have to say that Out There is marred by a number of factual and suppositional errors that indicate either sloppy research on Mr. Blum's part, simple inattention to detail, or a headlong rush into print, or perhaps all three. In short, Mr. Blum's UFO background is cover deep and paper thin. What else is one to make of a characteriza- tion of Berlitz's and Moore's The Philadelphia Experiment (p. 222) as \"a best-selling novel that told a pro- vocative story about a voyage to a futuristic world\"? In retrospect, Moore may well wish it had been a novel, but in fact it purports to be the true story of a secret Navy shipyard experiment gone awry. Even without reading the book or having seen the movie made from it, it's hard to imagine what Blum might have had in mind, or how he could possibly come up with a cap- sule description so far out of the ball park in every regard. He might as well have said The Philadelphia Experi- ment was a philosphical treatise on brotherly love. A few pages earlier (p. 219), arch-debunker Philip Klass is described as a \"pencil-thin\" figure, when, as anyone who has ever met or seen the man in person knows full well, he is politely portly in stature. These matters might seem pica- nyunish if they didn't continue to mount up with such maddening fre- quency throughout the text. On page 246, for example, Edward Condon is referred to as a physicist \"who later headed the Air Force-sponsored Pro- ject Blue Book.\" Had Blum bothered to even peruse the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, he would almost surely have learned that Con- don was the director of that Univer- sity of Colorado study project, and not the Air Force's Blue Book. Nor are these slips of mind con- fined solely to matters ufological. In a prologue to the discussion of SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial In- telligence, for instance, Blum postulates that \"the universe con- tained over a billion galaxies,\" a figure, according to my Asimov, that is off by a factor of only 100! A reader the least well versed in the UFO and scientific literature will be hard pressed to keep these molehills from adding up to a mountain. Moreover, anyone who was there at some of the events Blum relates may have a difficult time recognizing them. The most glaring failure of recreation has to do with Moore's speech at the 1989 Las Vegas MUFON Sym- posium. Blum discusses it throughout in terms that make it appear as if Moore's controversial talk was a defense of the MJ-12 documents and a direct attack on Klass' rebuttals of same. \"But as he spoke,\" Blum writes (p. 253), \"the combative side of this complicated personality began to break out. It wasn't long before he let loose with a welled-up, snarling, even baiting attack,\" at the end of which, \"the audiences was applauding mad- ly.\" Poor Philip Klass, next page, was said to be \"sitting toward the rear of the large room,\" tape-recorder in lap. As I remember, the audience may well have applauded the few remarks Moore actually made in the direction of Klass, who, if memory serves, was also sitting front row and center. To the best of my knowledge, unless he is running late and has a plane to catch, Klass never sits \"toward the rear\" of any UFO event. Bennewitz Affair In fact, Moore's talk was a con- sidered confession of his involvement, at the behest of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, in the Paul Bennewitz affair, and it was delivered before an often contentious and ultimately shocked and stunned au- dience who could barely comprehend what they were hearing. And rather than wait around for any applause that might have come his way, Moore immediately escaped through a door behind the stage. Admittedly, recreating an event at which one was not present is an honorable journalistic tradition. One cannot, after all, have been everywhere. Blum could, however, have checked his account for ac- curacy with someone who was pre- sent at Moore's talk before publishing it, in this case, either Moore, Klass or Stanton Friedman at the very least, all of whom he presumably inter- viewed in person. Instead, he resorts to sheer speculation, which, again, is wrong on almost all particulars. But let's assume I'm overlooking the forest on account of several un- sightly stumps around the perimeter, even as I'm now forced to wonder how many other stumps may be hid- den deeper in the woods. Blum's book will bring an otherwise accurate MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 account of the Bennewitz Affair before a vastly larger public than any ufologist will have managed. The month of September, for example, he will be on a twelve-city, coast-to-coast promotional tour for Out There that will take him to all the major media markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago and Washington, D.C. In addition, David Wolper and Warner Bros, have already reportedly purchased the film and TV rights and will be producing a four-part miniseries based on the book for NBC-TV. \"60 Minutes\" is also said to be developing a segment around Out There, probably for air- ing this Fall. Judged by the rest of the book, Blum's work still seems sure to stir up some embarrassing questions about the government's UFO policy. He reveals herein his discovery of a top level UFO Working Group, headed by a Colonel Harold Phillips under auspices of the Defense Intelligence Agency, that, presumably, continued to meet in the Tank room of the Pen- tagon. In the course of trying to unravel the exact purpose and nature of the Working Group, Blum en- counters the standard stonewalling and denials and never hesitates to call them lies. Blue Beam Although a sketchy portrait of the Working Group and their activities slowly emerges, many mysteries re- main. Despite the upper crust make- up of the seventeenman panel, its power, if any, to set policy or sub- poena classified data remains largely undefined. Blum does reveal, however, that on at least one occa- sion CIA agents of the Domestic Col- lection Division covertly interviewed witnesses for the WG in Elmwood, Wisconsin, site of a planned, public- sponsored $50 million UFO landing field that seems unlikely to ever get off the ground. Blum's own investiga- tions on location turn up the curious case of Elmwood deputy George Wheeler, who, the night of April 22, 1976, was knocked unconscious by a blue beam of light from a huge orange UFO. For the next six months Wheeler kept complaining: \"I got radiation poisoning. That UFO zap- ped me.\" Then he dropped dead from a heart attack. Curious, too, is the trail that first leads to Elmwood, considering that the WG chose it as the \"perfect can- didate\" for on-site investigation over both Gulf Breeze and the Hudson Valley sightings! If Blum's inside infor- mation is accurate, Gulf Breeze \"fell by the wayside after the colonel had some preliminary discussions with friends at Air Force Intelligence. It turned out that Air Force was testing a classifed low-flying surveillance plane in the area.\" Hudson Valley suf- fers a similar fate, despite the thousands of eyewitnesses, including numerous still and video photo- graphs. But does the colonel dismiss the New York sightings after further consultations with his buddies in Air Force Intelligence? No, this time we are told, Hudson Valley is given the heave-ho because local newspaper reports explained that \"the UFOs were nothing more than convoys of small planes flying with their nighttime running lights on.\" Later on, we are given an account of the WG poring over pictures of alien humanoids from People Magazine, as if that were the only source they had available. All in all, this seems a strange way for a supersecret UFO project to pro- ceed, if anyone onboard were in the know. They might just as well have subscribed to the MUFON Journal and saved themselves the trouble. One is either forced to resort to the hopefully outdated cliche that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms, or tempted to suggest that the WG itself is another cog in the cover-up. In fact, Blum, to his credit, recounts a meeting in which just that supposi- tion is raised by the WG members themselves. Blum is also quite good in the size- able sections of Out There that recap NASA's on-going SETI programs, particularly in his step-by-step ex- planation of the original Drake Equa- tion that led to their development. But I'd feel much better about the book as a whole if Blum's bare bones UFO backgrounding didn't glare through the last half so obtrusively. Knowing how slack his attention to the UFO data here is, even those readily available at a glance, one can't help but worry about the facts elsewhere as well. When I read a book I like to keep one hand free for turning pages. With Out There, despite its many positive points, I fre- quently found those fingers clutching a salt-shaker. UFOs in the 1980s: The UFO Encyclopedia, Volume 1 By Jerome Clark & Others, Apogee Books, Detroit, 234 pp., $65 Reviewed by Dennis Stacy Let's get this matter of price out of the way first. Whatever else this first of three projected volumes may be, it is first and foremost overpriced at $65, a figure which breaks down to almost 30 cents per acid-free-paper page, comes in rather uninspiring plastic- coated covers, and lacks any illustra- tions whatsoever. It is also something of a hybrid ex- ercise as well, as evidenced by the presence of two title pages, the first emphasizing its in-depth coverage of the contemporary UFO scene (developments during the 1980s), the second emphasizing its more general encyclopedic scope (individuals, organizations, etc.). Inevitably, it will be compared to its two decade-old predecessors, Ronald D. Story's The Encyclopedia of UFOs and Margaret Sachs' The UFO Encyclopedia, both published in 1980. Such comparisons are somewhat moot to my mind, given that so much has transpired in the interval, and that the other two encyclopedias are long out of print. There are 84 entries in all. Seven Continued on next page MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 of these are typically lengthy essays on what editor and primary author Jerome Clark refers to as \"the major foci of recent ufology.\" These include the abduction phenomenon, con- tactees, UFO crashes, Earthlights and v the tectonic strain theory (by Chris Rutkowski), extraterrestrial biological entities, the fantasy-prone personali- '\" ty hypothesis (at two pages, the shortest of the seven), and the psychosocial hypothesis. The remain- ing entries, mostly ranging from a paragraph or two, to a page or two, are devoted to prominent individuals in the field and various UFO and related organizations. Helpfully, the entries are cross-referenced, and the majority are accompanied by a listing of original source material for further reading or investigating. The index proves not only handy, but, as it turns out, absolutely necessary. I'm not sure how I feel about the hybrid nature of the book yet, but it does make for two bedfellows: the longer essays that can be read at leisure, and the shorter entries to serve as reference material. As with most encyclopedias, UFOs in the 1980s is not the sort of book one typically reads straight through from front to back, although a few readers will probably tackle it that way. If you want to learn all this encyclo- pedia has to say on a single subject, however, you're in for some page- turning, which is where the index comes in. Information about Whitley Strieber, for instance, is scattered over several entries, beginning with his last name, where one would naturally turn first, but also including Abduc- tion Phenomenon, Communion . Foundation, Contactees and Fantasy- Prone Personality Hypothesis. As might be expected, this is the ^. world of UFOs as seen through the prism of Jerome Clark, a vice- president of the Center for UFO Studies and long-time editor of CUFOS' bi-monthly journal, the In- ternational UFO Reporter. Clark strives manfully for objectivity, but nagging little quibbles still stick out here and there, especially when read from the point of view of the \"com- petition.\" In the entry for the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, for example, no mention is made of CUFOS membership or circulation numbers, yet the entry for the Mutual UFO Network mentions \"that total (MUFON) membership is well over 1000,\" when the actual figure is well over twice that, as Clark must have known. Such nuances, and I don't mean to make more of them than that, creep into the official history as well. For ex- ample, in the long, 23-page discus- sion of Extraterrestrial Biological En- tities, much is made of William Moore's role in the Bennewitz Affair and his subsequent confession of same at the 1989 MUFON Las Vegas Symposium. The impetus for this confession seems to be a paper released by Robert Hastings, \"The MJ-12 Affair: Facts, Questions, Com- ments,\" which \"was mailed ... to many of ufology's most prominent in- dividuals.\" Clark references same in his sources at the end of the article as published by the author in Albu- querque, which it was. Arguably, however, it was the appearance of that article under the same title in the June 1989 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal that prompted Moore to go into such detail in his Las Vegas ad- dress. And regardless of the ultimate source of the spur under Moore's blanket, readers and researchers are much more apt to be able to trace the original document to a back issue of the Journal than they are to Hasting's home in New Mexico. (Space limita- tions prevented the publishing of all of Hastings' appended documents, but the text of the article itself is car- ried complete.) Otherwise, Clark's coverage of Moore's talk is exemplary. To see how it was completely mishandled, for in- stance, refer to Howard Blum's treat- ment of the same event in Out There, reviewed above. Again, I don't mean to make a mountain out of piddling molehills. As an old Texas bumper sticker has it: \"If You Don't Have an Oil Well, Get One!\" The moral to Clark's UFO in the 1980s is that if you don't like his UFO history, go out and write your own.. Given that alternative, however, $65 may not be such a steep price, after all. Howard Blum Author of the book OUT THERE, The Government's Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials.

Details are sketchy as we go to press. Rogo, age 40, was a pro- lific author of books about various aspects of parapsychology, and also contributed a monthly column, \"On the Psychic Frontier,\" to Fate Magazine. Among many titles, he edited UFO Abductions (Signet, 1980) and co-authored, with Ann Druffel, The Tujunga Canyon Con- tacts (Signet, 1980, updated 1989). Rogo's body was found by police in his Northridge home near Los Angeles, apparently after neighbors noticed that his backyard sprinkler had not been turned off for two days. Reportedly, a VCR was taken, but the house was not otherwise ransacked. At the moment, the police are said to be treating the murder as an act of random violence. Our sympathies go out to his fami- ly, friends and associates. D. Scott Rogo is sure to be missed, not only among his own inner social circle, but by the larger community he so self-lessly served. LETTERS ... Dear Editor: Adherents of our so-called science range from gullible zealots to dispas- sionate researchers. With all due respect, the July article \"Desert Secrets\" by Erich A. Aggen, Jr. (a MUFON State Section Director in Missouri), plays to the left of this spectrum. Before asking readers to accept the author's claim that the Air Force has sequestered five million additional acres of land in Nevada, wouldn't it have been appropriate to seek out an official spokesperson to answer such a significant charge? A more journalistic approach to the whole article might have been to por- tray the hearsay material as a com- pilation of apocrypha or UFO folklore. Disclaimers could have been made about controversial sources such as Paul Bennewitz, Robert Lazar and John Lear. The author proposes that aircraft such as the F-117A and the B-2 may owe something to \"alien technology,\" overlooking the probability that fields like aeronautical and aerospace engineering have evolved over the last 20 years without any extraterrestrial influence. Just because something looks futuristic doesn't mean aliens had anything to do with it. Perhaps the juxtaposition of military facts with UFO folklore is just another aspect of the phenomena — high-tech storytell- ing if you will. Since the perennial problem of ufology is credibility, shouldn't the propagation and promotion of modem-day myths be ruled out of the MUFON UFO Journal's editorial policy? — David Schiller Salem, OR Continued on page 23 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Looking Back 19 Bob Gribble September 1950 • Very early one morning three fighter-bombers took off from an aircraft carrier on a search and destroy mission over Korea. Two men occupied each of the three planes. About 7 a.m. the three jet crews observed something very strange on the ground. One of the witnesses described the encounter: \"I was watching the ground and I was startled to see two large circular shadows coming along the ground from the NW at a high rate of speed. When I saw the shadows I looked up and saw the objects which were caus- ing them. They were huge. I knew that as soon as I looked at my radar screen. They were also going at a good clip — about 1000 or 1200 miles per hour ... the objects suddenly seemed to halt, back up and begin a 'jittering,' or 'fibrillating motion.' My first reaction, of course, was to shoot. \"I readied my guns, which auto- matically readied the gun cameras. When I readied the guns, however, the radar went haywire. The screen 'bloomed' and became very bright... I realized my radar had been jammed and was useless. I then called the car- rier, using the code name. I said the code name twice, and my receiver was out, blocked by a strange buzz- ing noise. While this was going on the objects were still jittering out there ahead of us, maintaining our speed. About the time I gave up trying to radio the carrier, the things began maneuvering around our planes, circl- ing above and below. They were huge, at least 600 or possibly 700 feet in diameter. They were shaped somewhat like a coolie's hat, with oblong ports. They had a 'silvered mirror' appearance, with a reddish glow surrounding them.\" When the craft finished their in- spection of the Navy planes they took off at a high rate of speed to the NW. During the encounter the three crews all noticed a feeling of warmth in the airplane, and also a high-frequency vibration. Upon returning to the car- rier the crews and their aircraft were tested for radiation. The men never knew the results of the Geiger-counter tests, but they did learn that the in- strument dials on their planes had 'become extremely luminous and all the gun camera film had been fogged or exposed, although none of the crews had used either guns or cameras. • 1955 While driving near Cincin- nati, Ohio, at 9:15 p.m. on the third, Frank Flaig and his wife spotted a round, metallic gray object descend- ing in front of them. Flaig stopped his car for a better look. Reflecting the moonlight, the spheroid had no pro- truding parts or lights. The object dropped out of sight behind an unlighted house, about 125 feet away. Flaig then went to the side of the house to investigate and found the craft suspended about a foot above the ground. About this time his wife cried out. At that very instant, the spheroid began to ascend, making no sound, and moved out of sight. Flaig estimated the object to be about four feet in diameter. • 1960 Thousands of parachute- shaped objects were seen descending from a height of 50,000 feet over Essex, England, on the 25th. The British Air Ministry and the American Air Force said they were \"baffled\" by the reports. Reports of sightings came in from many parts of Essex County. Aircraft engineer Maurice Fryer, of Crawley, said: \"I saw hundreds of them through the telescope, stretching higher and higher into space. They were at heights from 15,000 to well over 50,000 feet, and to be seen at those heights their size must have been terrific.\" Harlow police said there had been no reports of the objects landing in their area, but many peo- ple said they had seen them. • 1965 About 11 p.m. on the third, Chief Deputy B.E. McCoy and Depu- ty Sheriff Bob Goode of Angleton, Texas, were patrolling an area of Brazoria County when they spotted a glowing object in the distance. Sud- denly the object came toward the police cruiser and within three or four seconds was within 150 feet of the highway at an elevation of about 100 feet and parallel with the car. They later estimated that the craft was at least 200 feet long and between 40 and 50 feet high. Frightened, the men left the area as fast as the patrol car would take them — 110 miles per hour. The light around the object ap- peared to grow much brighter when it moved towards the men's position. It illuminated the object itself, the pasture over which it was hovering, the highway, the exterior and interior of the patrol car. Goode's window was down and his arm was extended beyond the window ledge, and he said that he definitely felt heat when the object was at its closest point. Earlier that evening, Goode had been bitten on the left index finger while helping his son move an alligator, and the wound had been badly swollen and bleeding profuse- ly. After the encounter with the UFO, the pain and swelling were gone and the wound was no longer bleeding. • Danny Bland, 17, and Tom Springs, 17, spotted a glowing \"space vehicle\" near Rio Vista, California, about 9 p.m. on the 22nd. Bland said he was the first to see the UFO. \"I ran home and then called my chum Tom. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 I grabbed a .22 rifle and Tom took a .22 pistol.\" They had the object in sight for about 20 minutes before they engaged it in \"combat.\" It had landed on a hillside in the vicinity of the city water tower near Highway 12. Using their weapons, they shot at the object \"six or seven times.\" They heard a definite sound \"like the bullets struck steel,\" they said, \"and the object got brighter each time a bullet hit.\" But the shots apparently didn't have any ef- fect, since the object took off. Bland said the light from the object \"flooded our car just as if the sun was shining.\" • On the evening of the 23rd, a glowing disc-shaped object appeared near the city of Cuernavaca, Mexico, about 40 miles south of Mexico City, and was witnessed by Governor Emilie Riva Palacie and most of the local residents. As the craft came in over the city at a low altitude, the ci- ty lights dimmed and electrical equip- ment began to fail. When the vehicle stopped and hovered, all of the city lights went out. For a few minutes the city remained dark, then the disc climbed swiftly out of sight and the lights came on again. Besides Gover- nor Palacie, the observers included Mayor Valentin Gonzales and a military zone chief, General Rafael Enrique Vega. • 1975 Two teenage sisters, driving south on Mountain Loop Highway, 20 miles SE of Darrington, Wash- ington, were intercepted by a glow- ing object which directed a shaft of blue-green light on their car about 10 p.m. on the 14th. As the car moved along the winding road through a forested area the driver suddenly became aware of the fact that she was not in control of the car. She deliberately removed her hands from the steering wheel and the vehicle continued on its course over the wind- ing roadway. The car appeared to be moving about five miles per hour, while the speedometer indicated the vehicle was moving 35 mph. The car did not respond to pressure on the brake or gas pedal. The two girls could hear music even though the radio was turned off. This route had been traveled many times by the girls and their parents. On this, par- ticular trip the travel time was about 45 minutes longer and the car only consumed about three-fourths as much gas as it should have. Both girls were put through hypnotic regression which revealed that they had been taken aboard an alien craft. • Two Delta Dart F-106 jet fighters, from the 318th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, were scrambled from McChord Air Force Base near Tacoma, Washington,'the night of the 26th in search of UFOs. A spokesman for the Air Force said the two fighter interceptors were sent aloft in response to numerous reports of UFO sightings in Tacoma skies. Neither pilot saw anything which might have been a source of the reported sight- ings, either visually or on radar, the spokesman said. About the same time, Pierce County Sheriff's Depart- ment was notified by McChord that their radar was tracking an uniden- tified object hovering over Tacoma at 18,000 feet. • 1980 Jerry McAlister, of Ander- son, South Carolina, was listening to his police scanner at 4:20 a.m. on the llth when \"I heard this awful racket outside my window. It was a shriek- ing noise that actually hurt my ears,\" he said. \"But when I got to the win- dow I saw this terrific light — it was sort of like flood lights — lighting up my whole backyard. The light hurt my eyes, it was so bright. I called to my wife who was asleep and then punched her with my crutch (he had an injured leg) and she got to the win- dow in time to see the light and hear the noise. Then my daughter Shirley got to the window and saw it. Then it turned sideways and swished sideways over those pine trees.\" McAlister described the object as round, about 70 feet wide and \"as thick as a two-story building. All around the edges of the big object were big bright lights and across the center of it was a row of square win- dows that were lighted up, too.\" The craft was ; about 25 feet above his backyard when he sighted it, and it hovered there for approximately three minutes. McAlister compared the ac- tion of the disc-like object to a plate whirling on a stick in a balancing act. \"It swiveled like it was winding down and might fall. Then it turned on its side and swished away, making a pur- ring noise.\" • About three-and-a-half hours later and about 25 miles north of Ander- son, Joe Garrett of Easley, South Carolina, also had a close encounter with a UFO. \"I had gone out to work on my wife's car. I heard a buzzing sound, sort of like a big swarm of bees. I got a glimpse of something over the top of the trees. I couldn't see it very good, so I walked around to the front of the house. And there it was, out in the clear, right over me. It was big, real big. It was as big as Belk's store, but a whole lot taller.\" Garrett described the windows as be- ing very long, and totally black, ex- cept for one that shone with a blind- ing, glaring light. Garrett was specific about the col- or. He said it appeared to be a metallic, purplish-gray. He was sure the bottom side of the craft was metal, of an exceptional smoothness. He saw no seams, although he said there was what appeared to be a metal pipe protruding from the underside. Gar- rett could not see the entire shape of the vehicle. He said it appeared to be tilted backward so that what he saw, primarily, was the bottom of the ob- ject. He saw enough of the upper part, however, to be sure that it was dome-shaped. \"It was shaped sort of like the big water tank up town,\" he said, \"except a whole lot bigger.\" Both men described the craft to artist Mickey Tate of the Pickens County Sheriff's Department. Neither man conferred with each other, but the sketches Tate drew from their descrip- tion were very similar. • George Black well, 54, farm hand and caretaker of the \"White-Acres\" property, some eight kilometers from Rosedale, Victoria, Australia, was MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 269 September 1990"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"21 awakened at 1 a.m. on the 30th by disturbances among the livestock, and a strange screeching, whistling noise. Cattle were bellowing, and a horse was running around in a state of panic. Blackwell went outdoors to investigate and spotted a dome-shaped craft about 500 feet away and moving about eight feet off the ground. He estimated its diameter as about 28 feet. Its height was about 15 feet. The vehicle then stopped over an open, concrete 10,000 gallon water tank, then seemed to either hover immedi- ately above, or to rest on top of the tank, for about a minute. The craft was seen to rise up several feet, then land some 50 feet to the north of the tank. Blackwell rode his motorcycle to the paddock where the vehicle had landed. He stopped his bike 30 to 50 feet from the craft. It seemed to con- sist of two sections, a white dome on top and a larger orange section underneath. Around this bottom sec- tion there were circular windows or lights, estimated to be about 10 feet apart and approximately seven inches in diameter. These seemed to give the impression that both parts were rotating counter-clockwise. The vehi- cle remained on the ground two to three minutes. Suddenly the whistl- ing noise increased to \"an awful scream,\" and the witness had to place his hands over his ears. There was a tremendous bang, and the craft lifted up and gradually moved away from the landing site, reaching a height of about eight to 10 feet. The witness was almost knocked from his bike by a blast of hot air. The bike's headlight illuminated the base of the vehicle, enabling Blackwell to see six evenly spaced \"spokes\" or V-- shaped \"things.\" About 30 feet out from the landing site, the craft fell silent. It was then that Blackwell saw material falling away from the base of the vehicle. This debris largely con- sisted of stones, capeweed and cow patties. After arriving home, he no- ticed a clock showing the time as 1:50 a.m. He found that his wrist watch had stopped at 1:10 a.m. It restarted after a few minutes when he laid it down, but stopped whenever he put it on. This problem persisted for about three days. At daybreak Blackwell returned to the landing site. He found a ring of \"black\" flattened grass, some 30 feet across, in a paddock covered with a blanket of yellow flowers, consisting of grass flattened in a counter- clockwise manner, to a width of 18 inches. Inside the ring there was on- ly green grass. The yellow flowers had been removed. Evenly spaced within the ring were six \"spokes\" of relatively undamaged grass. The disappearance of 10,000 gallons of water from the concrete water tank and, BlackwelFs headaches and nausea after his en- counter added to the mystery. • The pilot of a small airplane fly- ing near Pompano Beach, Florida, at 3 p.m. on the 27th, observed what appeared to be two aircraft ap- proaching head-on. As they neared his plane he could make out two ob- jects shaped like hamburger buns, moving side-by-side. When they got within 200 feet of his aircraft they began to circle his plane, without banking. The craft were yellow in col- or, about 10 feet in diameter, and re- mained about 200 feet distant. The two vehicles circled the small airplane about 50 times in five minutes, then broke away to the north. The objects were not picked up on radar.

Webb October 1990 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, increasing from -0.9 to -1.6 magnitude during October, begins retrograde (westward) motion on the 20th. Situated above the Hyades (the V-shaped face of the bull Taurus), the bright ruddy object rises in the NE about 8:30 daylight time in midmonth. As it heads toward a fine opposi- tion for northern observers next month, Mars enters its best period for telescope observation. October should provide good views of both poles on the red planet. It is midsummer in the Martian southern hemisphere. Look for a tiny white spot near the southern limb (on top in most astronomical telescopes), all that is left of the south polar cap. Hiding the north cap is a large bluish-white hood of atmospheric haze. Between both caps lie the Martian deserts, light and dark areas of differing gradations of surface dust. Duststorms and white clouds are sometimes visible. Saturn (magnitude 0.5), in Sagittarius, lies due south at dusk and later sets in the WSW about 11 PM (mid-October). The ringed giant is near the Moon on the 24th and 25th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars stands well up in the SW at dawn. Jupiter (-2.1), in Cancer, rises in the ENE about 12:45 in mid-month and is high in the SE at dawn. Early in the month the largest planet passes below the wedge-shaped star cluster called Praesepe the Manger, or \"Beehive.\" Jupiter lies near the lunar crescent on the 12th and 13th. Meteor Shower: There is no Moon this year to interfere with viewing the Orionid shower, which reaches its maximum on the mornings of October 21 and 22. An observer may count up to 25 meteors per hour toward dawn. Radiating from Orion's club, these meteors are very swift and faint, although some bright fireballs may be expected. Moon Phases: Full moon — October 4 (Harvest Moon) Last quarter — October 10 New moon — October 18 First quarter — October 26 The Stars: On the cool evenings of October, we find the Milky Way passing almost directly overhead and stretching across the sky from Auriga in the NE to Sagittarius in the SW. Long ago this faint band of light was believed to be a celestial roadway or river. Actually, it is the combined light of billions of stars too faint and too distant to be resolved into pinpoints with the un- aided eye. Our light-polluted skies have robbed us of much of the fragile beauty of the Milky Way. October evenings also bring into view a region of inconspicuous constella- tions known as \"The Sea.\" They include such mythological creatures of the ocean as Capricornus the Sea Goat (in the south), Aquarius the Water Bearer, Piscis Ausrrinus the Southern Fish (note its bright white star Fomalhaut), Pisces the Fish, and Cetus the Sea Monster (in the ESE at 9 PM). Cetus contains the first variable star ever discovered — Mira located in the monster's neck. This object is a red giant star which expands and con- tracts in a long-period cycle of 11 months. During this interval the star actually disappears to the naked eye and then experiences a 200-to 400-fold increase in brightness, from 9th or 10th magnitude to about 3rd or 4th. Early this month Mira should be near its peak brightness. To find it, wait until Cetus climbs higher in the SE. Then locate the Great Square of Pegasus and the large but faint \"V\" of Pisces to the lower left of the square. The apex of the \"V\" points directly to reddish Mira.

Press Conference John White has scheduled a press conference for Friday, October 12, 1990 at the Holiday Inn in North Haven, Conn, immediately preceding his UFO conference \"The UFO Ex- perience.\" The purpose of this press conference is to recommend that the U.S. Congress conduct a congres- sional investigation into our govern- ment's participation in the 43-year-old cover-up of the UFO phenomenon. Panelists planning to present statements include the following: Brian O'Leary, Larry Fawcett, Stan- ton Friedman, Howard Blum (author of Out There), Fred Whiting, Robert H. Bletchman, Antonio Huneeus and a representative of CUFOS. A similar appeal was made at the Pinta Hotel in New York City in 1989.

LETTERS, Continued Dear Editor: In answer to Mr. Schiller's letter I would say that if a person is not will- ing or able to go beyond mainstream concepts of reality he probably should not be involved in Ufology. Ufology is not a \"hard\" science — it is, however, an area of research that many scientists and other professional are involved in. It is an area of inquiry that invites a wide spectrum of speculation, extrapolation and in- vestigation. Persons who have a restrictive or conservative point of view will most likely find Ufology a very frustrating subject. Although the evidence for extrater- restrial UFOs and aliens is vast and im- pressive there are still those debunkers like Phil Klass and ufologists of the CUFOS and Vallee-Keel \"school\" who have their heads stuck in the sand and only seem intent on adding more \"noise\" to the signal. Mr. Schiller would probably be more comfortable in the company of Phil Klass and other armchair ufologists who spend all of their time criticizing and debating rather than doing the hard work of research and investigation. The footnote concerning the amount of Nellis AFB acreage in Nevada was mathematically calcu- lated from bombing and gunnery range maps published in the book \"Red Flag\" by Michael Skinner and FAA restricted airspace maps pub- lished in Aviation Week 8/22/88. Of- ficial USAF maps regularly show these areas either smaller than they actually are, omit certain ranges or show localized sections of the ranges that do not portray the full extent of the ranges. If official government in- formation had been considered as tru- ly factual or as some sort of \"criteria\" we would still be in the dark about government UFO data! The hypothesis that alien tech- nological spinoffs have aided \"black\" programs, starwars and stealth technology is an idea shared by per- sons intimately involved in those fields as well as informed ufologists. \"Credibility\" is a problem that will always plague UFO research until the time comes when we have actual alien artifacts in our hands or until the aliens reveal themselves in an in- disputable way. — Erich A.

A State Section Director could be responsible for several counties grouped geographically or a single county in high-population density areas containing a large city. He/she would not only be responsible for supervising all UFO sighting investiga- tions, but arrange for the training of new investigators and represent MUFON to the news media and police agencies for effective public relations. All State Section Directors report directly to their State Director and/or Assistant State Director as an integral part of the State investigative team. To make this goal a reality. State Directors must systematically evaluate their members for leadership attributes, seeking out competent people to as- sign or reassign to the counties in which the member resides. A few of our State Directors have been neg- ligent in directing their attention to this vital goal and tend to expect MUFON headquarters to make these assign- ments.

Present members interested in assuming greater responsibilities on their State team should contact their State Director and volunteer their ser- vices. Since MUFON is basically a volunteer organization, the latter route is very apropos. UFO Slide Presentation Through the fine work of Dan Wright, Deputy Director, Investiga- tions, and John W. Komar, Tennessee State Director, a set of 45 slides with a narrative script has been assembled, designed for State Directors, Assistant State Directors and State Section Directors making public UFO lectures to schools, church groups, service clubs and fraternal organizations. Twenty-five sets were sold at the Pen- sacola Symposium, with a limited number still available for the above classified members only. Please write and send a check for $20 to John W. Komar, 4769 Lake Ridge Drive, Mem- phis, TN 38109. New Officers New State Section Directors ap- pointed this month are the following: Keith Rowell (West Linn, OR) for Clackamas County; Stephen J.
