The theme of the MUFON 1994 International UFO Symposium was \"Ufology: A Historical Perspective.\" The event was a weekend celebration of past accomplishments and future promise. Speakers recounted the histories of most of the major civilian UFO organizations, including both the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). Richard Hall was unable to attend in person, but his paper on the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) can be found in the largest symposium proceedings yet published (306 pages, $20 plus $1.50 postage and handling from MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, Texas, 78155-4099). Host chairperson and MUFON state director Ellen R. Stuart, husband Monte Stuart, master of ceremonies Ed Surma, and all the other local volunteers or participants are to be congratulated on a most successful conference. The 1995 MUFON symposium, hosted by chairperson Judy Tuberg, will be held in Seattle, Washington. THE 1994 MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM Report by Dennis Stacy/Photographs by Ansen Seale T he first speaker to the platform was researcher Karla Turner of Arkansas, herself an abductee and author of Into the Fringe (Berkeley, 1992) and Taken: Inside the Alien-Human Abduction Agenda (Kelt Works, 1994). \"My own experiences as an abductee and my subse- quent work with other abduction reports,\" Turner began, \"has shown me that ufology's current understanding of the abduction phenomenon underestimates the situa- tion. . . we need an expanded definition of the abduction scenario if we are to make progress.\" In particular, Turner feels the two prevailing atti- tudes about abductions are too limited because they tend to omit many reported experiences that don't seem to dovetail with either scenario. The two prevailing the- ories are of course the idea that extraterrestrial entities are engaged in a widespread program of genetic hy- bridization, or that the abductors \"are our spiritual su- periors here to assist the human race in its upward pro- gression.\" After a detailed examination of the kinds of experi- ences reported by the eight female subjects of Taken, Turner said \"we can see that the phenomenon involves much more than crossbreeding activities and spiritual el- evation. And although the details shown here come from only eight cases, they are repeated in numerous other abduction accounts. The main areas I wish to em- phasize concern I) the frequent experience of undergo- ing brain operations, which has nothing to do with crossbreeding, 2) the forced sexual encounters, with varying scenarios from case to case (which would seem to have little to do with spiritual elevation), and 3) the repeated accounts of human military personnel and un- derground facilities.\" VIRTUAL REALITY SCENARIO Turner also identified what she referred to as \"an artifi- cially induced virtual-reality scenario (VRS). an exter- nally introduced event that to the witness is practically indistinguishable from objective reality.\" An example of the latter, involving three witnesses, reportedly occurred in Florida when psychic Ted Rice was visiting two friends, Marie and Amelia. Awakened by Marie's shouts, Ted ran down the hall to their room where he found her in shock, pointing at the other twin bed. An immobile Amelia lay there, surrounded by a huge, blue-glowing sphere of \"electrical\" light. She was talking to someone neither Ted nor Marie could see, and continued to do so Karla Turner, Ph.D. AUGUST 1994 NUMBER 316 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL until the blue ball of light finally disappeared and she was released from the paralysis. According to Amelia, the experience had begun with the sound of a helicopter overhead. Looking up, it was as if the roof and ceiling of the house were invisible or transparent. She said she could see a \"helicopter\" with two entities, who also appeared at the foot of her bed be- fore the blue light vanished. The taller one had an egg- shaped head with slanted eyes and greenish \"alligator\" skin; the shorter one was bluish-black in color, like a raisin. Presumably, Amelia experienced an artificially in- duced VRS, whereas Ted and Marie, neither of whom heard a helicopter, either, perceived only the application or byproducts of the technology—the electric blue light. MUFON John H. Schuessler, a founding member of MUFON and presently Deputy Director for Administration, re- viewed the organization's humble origins, subsequent growth and current success, all attributable, said Schuessler, to MUFON's \"grass roots nature, where a majority of the leadership and motivation is achieved at the local level.\" John also referred to the MUFON UFO Journal as \"our most significant means of sharing UFO sighting re- ports and vital information with our members through- out the world/' He held up the first issue of Skylook, as the Journal was then called, and noted that when pub- lished in September of 1967, it went to a grand total of 27 people, all in the state of Missouri. Today, the Journal publishes more than 5000 copies a month and is dis- tributed worldwide. MUFON itself, then known as the Midwest UFO Network was founded on May 31, 1969, in Quincy, Illinois, where Walter Andrus was then employed with Motorola. The first annual summer symposium was held the following year, and the first published Proceedings appeared the year after that. \"Our Amateur Radio Net and computer BBS Network are also very active. We have a medical com- mittee and an abduction committee. The abduction tran- scription project is quite successful. Our specialists are continuing the crash/retrieval work, animal mutilation research, photo and video analysis, crop circle investi- gations, landing trace data collection, and more. These are all signs of a mature and well functioning organiza- tion, one that is prepared to see this mystery through to a conclusion.\" SOVIET \"ABDUCTIONS\" The visiting Dr. Vladimir V. Rubtsov, co-director of the Joint USA-CIS Aerial Anomaly Federation, gave a very interesting talk on a handful of Soviet \"alien contact and abduction\" cases and the methodological approaches that might be needed to illuminate them. He also pointed out that there do seem to be differences between such John F. Schuessler. M.S. cases as reported in the West and in what is now the countries of the former Soviet Union, and that a de- tailed examination of these differences might prove fruitful. Unfortunately, in the case of the Confederation of Independent States, such an analysis will have to await a better database. Ironically. Rubtsov noted, the problem has also been exacerbated by the collapse of the Soviet Union. \"Only 15 years ago,\" he noted, \"the sets of UFO reports in the West and the USSR were almost totally independent of one another\" because of the closed nature of Soviet society. With the collapse of the prevailing political system, however, all sorts of \"contamination\" has poured into the field of ufology, from both within and without. As more and more reports from without filter in. the lo- cal population becomes more aware of the existing Vladimir V. Rubtsov, Ph.D. PAGE 4 NUMBER 316 AUGUST 1994"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Western paradigms or established parameters. At the same time, the relative loosening of controls over every aspect of local life have allowed a dramatic rise in tabloid sensationalism and charlatanism in genera, mak- ing the establishment of a reliable local database that much more difficult. Thus it may be that some of the more revealing comparisons or distinctions will come from analyzing USSR UFO cases from the 50's, 6()'s and 70's, as opposed to the most recent ones. A statistical analysis of Soviet contact and abduction reports being practically impossible at this stage. Rubtsov could only address cases he had personally in- vestigated. In one case, Mrs. S. G., a 35-year-old bio- chemist employed at a large research facility near Moscow, was in her bedroom on the night of September 3, 1977. Her husband and daughter were already asleep, the latter in another room. At about 2 AM she saw a Saturn-shaped UFO through the window, from which il- luminated figures of uniformed Soviet soldiers flew in the direction of the residential area. One landed on her apartment balcony and explained, in the course of a two-hour conversation, that he was an extraterrestrial disguised as a soldier. During the course of their conversation, many mat- ters, technical, cultural and historical were discussed, but perhaps more significantly the \"soldier\" slowly changed his appearance to that of an acquaintance of the woman whom she liked. He then suggested she \"behave with him as she did with her husband,\" a suggestion which she rebuked. Eventually he (and the other humanoids) flew away and re-entered the UFO, which then faded away. She thought she wouldn't be able to go to sleep but when she lay down in bed, she drifted off almost im- mediately. According to Rubtsov, this \"reproductive\" aspect, com- mon to Western abduction accounts, also seems typical of Soviet encounters (although other aspects aren't) and may lie \"close to the heart of the matter.\" He cautioned, how- ever, that given \"the special sensitiveness of this topic and the role of sex in human life, one can soundly assume there is a lot of 'noise' in this information.\" Rubtsov concluded by repeating the words of the late Dr. Felix Zigel, the father of Soviet ufology, who noted that a global phenomenon called for a global in- vestigation. APRO & UFOs After lunch, Dr. James Harder, former director of re- search for the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization from 1969 to 1982, gave a historical summary of APRO's influence and impact on the field of ufology, in- cluding its involvement in some of the major cases, particularly the Travis Walton abduction. APRO, the earliest civilian UFO research organiza- tion in the U. S.. was founded in 1952 by the feisty Coral Lorenzen, shortly after her 27th birthday. While Coral was APRO's chief architect and advocate, she James E. Harder, Ph.D. believed, given the temper of the times, that it would be more well received with a man at its head, and so hus- band Jim was named director of the original 52 mem- bers. Two years later. APRO moved to Alamogordo, New Mexico, and in 1960 to Tucson, Arizona, where it would remain until the death of both Jim and Coral. The organization grew over the years, with scien- tific consultants and representatives from various foreign countries being added. Alone or in company with her husband. Coral wrote and published three influential books, beginning with The Great Flying Saucer Hoax. (1962), Flying Saucer Occupants (1967), and its up- date. Encounters With UFO Occupants ( 1975). In general, the early UFO organizations tended to be skeptical of UFO occupant cases. But that slowly changed, thanks to Coral's support of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case and other reports carried in the APRO Bulletin or Newsletter and the above men- tioned books. The \"unthinkable\" gradually became ac- ceptable. Because of Coral's failing health, the Bulletin, first published in July of 1952, ceased publication in 1988. Jim Lorenzen had died two years earlier, on August 21, 1986, and been buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Coral died on April 12, 1988. and was buried next to her husband. MULTIPLE UFOs Much can be learned from multiple witness UFO cases, but much can be learned from cases involving multiple UFOs, too. according to Dr. Richard F. Haines, a retired perceptual psychologist with NASA-Ames, who has written the book on the subject, Project Delta: A Study of Multiple UFO (to be reviewed in a future issue). The need for such a study, said Haines, was obvious: \"The more objects there are, the harder it is to explain them away in rather simple, prosaic ways.\" Drawing on AUGUST 1994 NUMBER 316 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Richard F. Haines. Ph.D. NICAP's 77«? UFO Evidence. Air Force Project Blue Book, and his own extensive files as well as those of other researchers, he was able to collect some 230 mul- tiple UFO sightings from 40 states in this country and 35 countries abroad. \"The cases.\" Haines said, \"were grouped into 17 flight dynamic categories to see if they might some- how display similarities or differences. The conclusions from this review are quite simple. In a large majority of these reports, the multiple objects all appear alike and are usually oval or disc-shaped.\" Haines added that they also \"possess no visible means of propulsion, appear metallic and possess no mark- ings, wings, vertical stabilizer, or other surface detail. They fly in a rigid formation across the sky, and show a single rigid formation throughout the sighting.\" Moreover. Haines added, \"only a very tiny fraction of all the sighting reports studied here can be explained as flocks of birds, precision acrobatic airplanes, or some as- tronomical event. The majority are clearly under intel- ligent control. It isn't likely that our intelligence is high enough to build and fly such marvelous craft as these. Only time will tell whether or not we ever will.\" WHAT THE RUSSIANS KNOW George Knapp is the well known award-winning pro- ducer of at least two video UFO documentaries, with more no doubt to come. A former news anchor with the CBS affiliate in Las Vegas, Nevada, he is now a Senior Vice President for Altamira Communications. Frustrated by our own government's stonewalling of UFO documents. Knapp and his colleagues glimpsed a unique opportunity in the collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent opening of many government files. Through his congressman, Jim Bilbray, Knapp was able to obtain a meeting with the respected Russian physicist. Dr. Nikolai Kapranov, while the latter was on a year- long sabbatical in this country in 1992. Dr. Kapranov agreed to try to find out what he could about any Soviet UFO sightings or reports. Altamira put him on retainer and helped set up an office in Moscow. By March of the following year it was felt that he had accumulated enough useful information that Knapp. ac- companied by journalist Bryan Gresh and photogra- pher Bryant Blackburn, left for a ten-day whirlwind visit even though Moscow itself remained gripped by political turmoil. \"The only proviso we gave Kapranov,\" Knapp said, \"was that we wanted to avoid any of the Russian UFO figures who were already known in the west. We didn't want to rehash some of the same stories which had already been told on American tabloid TV or at UFO conferences. We wanted to uncover a new level of information, new sources, people who may be in po- sitions to know about UFO research but had never at- tempted to attract attention or cash in on sensational claims.\" One individual. Knapp and company were put in touch with was Boris Sokolov. a retired Red Army Colonel from a distinguished military family. According to Sokolov, in 1978, the Ministry of Defense issued an order to report and investigate all UFO reports which es- sentially \"transformed the entire Soviet Union into one gigantic listening post.\" Sokolov said that thousands of reports were col- lected. \"The military was interested for three reasons,\" he said, \"because of the unpredictable movement of UFOs, the quick changes in course movement, and be- cause UFOs observed visually were not always seen on radar, and those seen on radar could not always be seen visually. They thought that if the secrets of the UFOs could be discovered, we would be able to win the competition against our prospective enemies in terms of George Knapp, M.A. PAGE 6 NUMBER 316 AUGUST 1994"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL velocity, materials and visibility\" in order to build their own Stealth technology. Over a period of ten years, Sokolov compiled his own capsulized dossier from the reports that crossed his desk. Engaging in a bit of admitted \"checkbook journalism,\" Knapp and the Altamira team were able to purchase Sokolov's files and have since had them trans- lated into English. \"I would like to be able to tell you that they contain incredible insights into the UFO mys- tery,\" Knapp said, \"but they don't. Most could be clas- sified as run-of-the-mill UFO encounters...The real sig- nificance of the MOD files is not found in the details of individual cases, in my opinion, but rather in the scope of the overall study effort.\" Through Sokolov and others, Knapp was put in touch with the civilian who currently heads the military's al- leged UFO study, code named \"Thread 3.\" According to related documents, Soviet studies of the phenomenon may date to the 1947 Roswell incident, which Stalin himself reportedly expressed interest in. HUMAN-ALIEN CONTACT By his own admission, Michael Lindemann, founding director of the 2020 Group, is perhaps best described as a historian, political scientist and futurist rather than a ufologist. Since 1989, however, he has taken serious interest in the subject, particularly as regards its possible implications for official secrecy and covert policy. Lindemann noted that two terms he would be refer- ring to frequently needed defining: government and alien. As for the first, Lindemann said he wished to emphasize \"that I do not regard our elected govern- ment as the bad guy with respect to the UFO situation. In fact, it seems probable that most elected officials know absolutely nothing about UFOs or alien activity. However, there are undoubtedly powerful and secre- tive individuals within our government who essentially 'manage' the UFO situation, as far as that is possible. Unless otherwise noted, it is these people I refer to henceforth when I use the term 'government,' and I de- scribe them as follows: An elite group, mainly non- elected, who guide the evolution of policy from behind the scenes, who transcend partisan politics, and who consider themselves the final guardians of geo-political reality. In effect, this group represents a secret govern- ment behind the visible, legitimate government, and experience suggests that they operate above the law, an attitude not unlike the 'Divine Rights of Kings.' \"By alien I mean an unidentified, non-human, intel- ligent being. Aliens might be extraterrestrial, but not necessarily. They might be indigenous to the earth. They might come from another dimension, from a par- allel universe, or even a different point in time. They might be all of the above or none of the above. In fact, the testimony of experiencers indicates a variety of alien types. They probably hail from a variety of places, and they seem to have a variety of characters and agen- Michael P. Lindeinann das. You'll notice that I didn't say good or bad because, frankly, I don't know. The evidence is extremely am- biguous. We probably shouldn't be quick to make moral judgments of any kind whatsoever.\" The presence of aliens on the planet represents what Lindemann refers to as a \"meta-lever,\" an \"influence ca- pable of disrupting the momentum of history on a global scale in completely unpredictable ways. A meta-lever can create a historical discontinuity, a point past which the future cannot be easily imagined or predicted.\" A meta-lever inevitably represents a political dilemma, Lindemann said, because it puts the future itself at risk in terms of its predictability and the survival of the status quo. \"Non-predictability is something that you can't invest in. If you can't predict, you cannot plan, you cannot build, you cannot bet. Everything be- comes intolerably risky and unstable. The status quo in all its aspects—science, religion, social order—is en- tirely up for grabs if the UFO reality is as big and as strange as it appears to be.\" Continuing, Lindemann said he regarded \"the pres- ence of alien intelligence on the earth as the unique meta-lever of our time; indeed perhaps the unique meta- lever in all of human history. Though it is not at all likely to cause widespread physical destruction of the kind associated with nuclear war, I nonetheless predict that most people in this room will live to see the day when this meta-lever is causing enormous, unpredictable global changes in the way we view reality and in the way we conduct our lives.\" Typically, said Lindemann, \"the potential impact of a meta-lever is not immediately obvious. Public perception evolves through three major phases.\" These are 1) denial and rationalization, 2) confusion and debate, and 3) recognition and mitigation of the problem. \"At the pre- sent time, human society as a whole remains stuck in the phase of denial and rationalization concerning claims of AUGUST 1994 NUMBER 316 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL an alien presence on earth. But there are clear signs that we're on the verge of entering phase two, confusion and debate; and once that happens, I believe things will start to move very quickly. \"In the meantime, I think we can agree that our gov- ernment has a problem. How are they going to explain this alien presence to you? What are they going to say that does not render them either bald-faced liars or im- potent, irrelevant non-leaders, or both? Are they not, in fact, between the proverbial rock and hard place? \"As far as I've been able to determine, the only thing they can do, and the thing they are now doing, is to pro- mote a gradual release of information or a gradual eas- ing of restrictions on stories and images of alien activity, with the effect of slowly inundating us all with a wide variety of information that is meant to move us from the stage of absolute denial into the stage of confusion and debate. \"Whether our final wake-up comes with a whimper or a bang,\" Lindemann concluded, \"I think we'll eventually recognize some kind of relationship, some kind of an- cient rootedness, in these phenomena. The Really Big Secret, I think, is that the alien presence is not new. it's as old as history.\" THE LINDA CASE Abductee Linda \"Cortile\" offered a personal look behind the experience of what some are now referring to as \"the case of the century.\" Many of you will be familiar with the basic details of her case, how early on the morning of November 30, 1989, she was allegedly floated outside her New York apartment building and into a hovering UFO, accompanied all the while by three diminuitive alien beings. How it was later learned that two security operatives, known only as Richard and Dan, claimed to have been nearby and to have witnessed the abduction while in the company of an even more mysterious \"third Linda \"Cortile\" PAGES \\\\onne R. Smith man,\" rumored to be a former high UN official. How she was later abducted off the street by the two and sub- jected to a more than two-hour-long interrogation. How a possibly unbalanced Dan kidnapped her alone later, how skeptics made her name public and so on. Budd Hopkins is said to be at work on a book about the sub- ject. Linda's own feelings about the case seem to con- tinue to focus and center on the health of her own nu- clear family, which includes a husband and two sons, age 11 and 18. Apparently, it hasn't been easy. ABDUCTION ANATOMY \"An abduction can occur to anyone at anytime,\" noted California psychotherapist Yvonne Smith, director of abduction research for MUFON-LA. \"However, re- search shows that it usually begins in childhood and continues throughout that person's life.\" Most abductions appear to involve a period of be- tween 30 minutes and two hours or more of \"missing time.\" and what is referred to as a \"bedroom visita- tion,\" meaning that the experience takes place while one is lying in bed. Consciously, or via hypnosis, the in- dividual often remembers being floated aboard a beam of light into what appears to be a circular-shaped craft. They are then led into something much like \"a hospital operating room.\" where they suddenly find themselves naked, \"although there is no memory of being un- dressed,\" and subsequently subjected to a physical ex- amination. The latter typically begins at the feet and continues upward over the entire body. Males are subjected to the humiliating extraction of sperm, females to the re- moval of their ova, or eggs. Females may also be shown a \"hybrid baby\" to hold and nurse. \"Another very common procedure involves the head area,\" Smith said. \"A long, thin, needle-like instrument NUMBER 316 AUGUST 1994"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Reverend Barry H. Downing, Ph.D. or probe may be used to insert a small device in either ear. behind the eyes, or deep within the nasal cavity.\" During such procedures, a taller alien being seems to stand nearby and provide a calming influence as neces- sary, often looming nearly nose-to-nose. Hypnosis can be viewed as a sort of information overload which triggers the natural \"fight or flight\" re- sponse. In this case, flight or escape occurs, as the indi- vidual's breathing becomes more shallow and the body more relaxed. \"Environmental\" hypnosis is often achieved in ordinary day-to-day life because of the overwhelming sensory input. Smith concluded that \"it is frustrating to work with many abductess on a very personal level, because I do not have definitive answers to their most fundamental questions. These include: What is their purpose, where are they from, and are their intentions benevolent or malevolent?\" UFOs & RELIGION Dr. Barry Downing, a MUFON consultant in religion, celebrated an anniversary of his own. It was in 1968 that his book. The Bible and Flying Saucers, was first pub- lished. \"At the time,\" he noted, \"I thought the final rev- elation of what UFOs were all about was just around the corner. Now I think just the opposite, that a final reve- lation will probably never occur in a public sense.\" The change in Downing's thinking is the product of years of meditation on the nature of both UFOs and the Judeo-Christian God. The key may lie in the fact that both appear to be able to control their visibility, visible one minute, invisible the next. In God's case, invisibil- ity is a means of both increasing and testing faith. Downing does not suggest, however, that we believe in UFOs on faith and faith alone. What he implies in- stead is that UFOs may choose those to whom they will appear; at the same time, their motives, particularly in terms of moral interpretation, may remain invisible to almost everyone. This latter aspect makes it particu- larly difficult to interpret abductions in simple, dualistic good/bad terms. The Jewish Passover—which killed the first-born Egyptians—was \"good\" if you were Jewish, but very bad if you were an Egyptian! \"We need to keep this in mind.\" Downing concluded. \"We are not God, we have only been made in the image of God. We get to play God in this world in the same sense that the scientist is God to his rats. But there is a world above us, and we need to suppose that from the point of view of that world, we are the rats and not the scientists. And we are probably only going to know what the head scientists want us to know. The rest will remain invisible.\" UFOs & HISTORY During the early 60's, Robert O. Dean served in the NATO Operations Division of SHAPE, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. It was during this time, reportedly in the wake of numerous UFO incidents and a lack of response from both Washington and London, that SHAPE conducted its own investigation, published in 1964 as The Assessment. According to Dean, only 15 copies of the eight-inch- thick document were printed, which, as an intelligence analyst with \"cosmic top-secret clearance,\" he says he was allowed to read. Among other items reported, ac- cording to Dean, was the recovery of a 90-foot disc with bodies near Bremen, Germany. Dean said \"Tlie Assessment reached three basic con- clusions: 1) the Earth has been spied upon by several ex- traterrestrial civilizations for thousands of years; 2) these civilizations appear to be peaceful since they are so advanced they could have taken over our planet by now; 3) the visitors are increasing contact with us in a Robert O.

However, UFOs have also been reported in associa- tion with the formation of crop circles, depending on how one wishes to define UFO. Reports of structured craft are rare, in other words. More common, according to Wingfield, are luminous orange balls of light that are usually completely silent and appear to be poly- morphous, \"often changing size and shape and some- times moving with a bobbing motion or like a falling leaf. The movement is often more suggestive of a living thing, rather than a craft, but certainly appears purpo- sive.\" In addition, \"they seem to have a transient existence within our dimensions, often blinking out or vanishing abruptly. 'Place' also seems to be of primary impor- tance, since these UFOs appear to consistently frequent certain venues, such as the Wiltshire and Warminster ar- eas.\" SHUTTLE VIDEO On September 15, 1991, the Space Shuttle Discovery videotaped an unusual aerial ballet involving at least two glowing light sources and two streaks of light. At the time, between 20:30 and 20:45 GMT, Discovery was ap- proximately 355 miles above the Earth's surface. Approximately 65 seconds later, the camera, attached to the rear of the Shuttle's cargo bay and aimed at the Earth's horizon, ceased broadcasting. Fortunately, UFO researcher Donald Ratch of Maryland taped the sequence on NASA Select, a na- tional cable TV channel that broadcasts NASA activities. Ratch thought the sequence unusual enough to draw it to the attention of his congresswoman, Ms. Helen Bentley. He also contacted Vincent DiPietro, a NASA engineer at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD, who also contacted his congresswoman, Ms. Beverly Byron. In turn, Ms. Byron sent the tape to George E. Brown, Jr., chair of the Congressional Committee on Science, Space and Technology. He and several mem- bers of his staff viewed the videotape and concluded that the objects were probably ice particles from the Shuttle. Their apparent change of direction was probably attrib- utable to the firing of one of the Shuttle's attitude ad- juster rockets, and indeed a brief flash of light can be seen in the lower left-hand corner of the video. It was also shown to Martin P. Kress, an assistant administrator for legislative affairs at NASA, who concurred with the ice particle theory. George Wingfield, M.A. 'To the best of my knowledge,\" Dr. Jack Kasher told the Sunday crowd, \"the individuals who suspected ice particles merely watched the videotape and did no fur- ther scientific analysis.\" Kasher, a MUFON consultant in physics and Nebraska state director, has worked with NASA in the past and presently teaches physics and astronomy at the University of Nebraska, Omaha. In fact, said Kasher, the objects behaved oddly for ice, or any other kind of particles. Assuming their change of di- rection was caused by the firing of a Shuttle rocket, their directional paths should trace back to a single source, but according to Kasher's detailed analysis, sponsored by a grant from the Fund for UFO Research, they don't. Moreover, one of the particles appears to re- main motionless for almost half a second. Any acceler- ation should have been continuous. Equally mysteri- ous, streaks of light appear to pass through the space va- cated by both objects after their abrupt change of direc- tion. In all, Kasher demonstrated five different proofs that completely discounted the ice particle theory. \"It's hard not to think that the objects were some kind of spaceship at a considerable distance from the Shuttle,\" said Kasher, \"and although it's only specula- tion, the streaks of light look like missiles fired in their direction.\" Depending on the exact distance from the Shuttle, the acceleration value in g's would have been anywhere from 10.5 to 18,000! The final velocity, assuming a distance of one mile to 1710 miles, would have varied from 250 miles per hour to a staggering 430,000 mph. Either way you look at it, that's some ice particle!

Leigh Culver, Cl.H. I f you are a UFO researcher you may have been asked to investigate a possible UFO sighting. Perhaps you drove out to the site and interviewed several witnesses that saw a UFO land on their property. Did you get all of the information available from the wit- nesses? Did you know that there is an interview tech- nique that enhances memory recall and that signifi- cantly increases the amount of accurate information available from a witness? Well, there is such a technique, and it's called the cognitive interview. The cognitive interview was developed by researchers who wanted a non-hypnotic memory-retrieval technique that would enhance the completeness and accuracy of eyewitness reports. The method is easy to learn and upon completion of reading this article you will be able to conduct a cognitive interview. Since the 1950s, hypnosis has been used by law en- forcement investigators in this country for the retrieval and enhancement of eyewitness memory. Information is the most important element in a criminal investigation. The ability of investigators to obtain accurate and useful information from witnesses and/or victims of crimes is crucial to making and prosecuting criminal cases. Often an eyewitness will tend to focus on the victim, or on a weapon, and important details will become lost and not remembered. Standard interviewing techniques have not always been found to be effective in obtaining reli- able testimony. Because of this, the techniques of in- vestigative or forensic hypnosis are often employed. Hypnosis has been found to be a very useful tool for memory retrieval both in studies and in the courtroom. Forensic hypnosis, however, occasionally has legal prob- lems due to the concept of tampering with the evidence, i.e. the witness or victim's mind. Because of this, other memory retrieval techniques have been explored, and out of this research the cognitive interview technique was developed. This technique is a valuable tool for law enforcement investigators and it can be an equally valuable tool for the UFO researcher. Unlike hypnosis, the technique can be easily learned and it doesn't require a great deal of training. The cognitive interview technique was developed in 1984 by Martin Reiser, Ed.D., Director of Behavioral Science Services for the Los Angeles Police Department, along, with other researchers from the UCLA Department of Psychology. In 1985, the National Institute of Justice published, in the December issue of Research In Brief, the results of the UCLA study. The results showed that the cognitive interview and hypnosis elicited significantly more correct informa- tion than the standard interview. The study also demon- strated that there was no significant increase in incorrect information. Tables 1 and 2 will help illustrate the results of the UCLA study. TABLE 1. Facts recalled in three types of inter- views: TYPE OF INTERVIEW: COGNITIVE HYPNOSIS STANDARD Number Correct 41.15 38.00 29.40 Number Incorrect 7.30 5.90 6.10 TABLE 2. Recall of the 20 most critical facts: TYPE OF INTERVIEW: COGNITIVE HYPNOSIS STANDARD Number Correct 12.0 12.3 9.2 Number Incorrect 1.1 1.7 1.4 As you can see from the results, they were very pos- itive. In all, there were five different experiments con- ducted, and it was found that the cognitive interview and hypnosis had very similar results; however, standard interviewing techniques were found to be less effec- tive. The cognitive interview shifts the focus to how peo- ple remember. The more elements a memory retrieval aid has in common with the memory of the event, the more effective the aid is. Memory has several access routes, so information that is not accessible with one re- trieval cue may be accessible with a different one. The cognitive interview uses four general methods and several specific methods of cuing memory. The first two methods attempt to increase the overlap of el- ements between retrieval cues and stored memory. The last two methods attempt to increase the amount of re- trieval access routes. The basic techniques of the cognitive interview are: (1) reconstruct the circumstances, (2) report everything, (3) recall the events in a different order, and (4) change perspectives. The method is systematic and the order of the techniques is important. During the interview start with 1, then 2, then 3, and then 4.

RECONSTRUCT THE CIRCUMSTANCES In this method the researcher instructs the witness to re- construct the circumstances of the event in general. The witness presents a narrative from beginning to end. This will give a general overview of the incident. Never have the witness start with the event itself, but with ordinary events that occurred before the incident in question. What was the witness saying, doing, feeling, seeing just before the incident? An example might be, \"I got up this morning and made breakfast. After breakfast I de- cided to walk my dog, 'Lad.' So Lad and I went out to the field. That's when I saw the UFO sitting behind the trees....\" REPORT EVERYTHING The researcher explains that some people hold back in- formation because they feel that it was not important. Ask the witness not to edit anything, even things that they feel are not very important. As the witness presents the narrative, encourage reinstatement of everything happening—for example, the weather, time of day, all surrounding properties, lighting, nearby people, every- thing. Focus on each change of context and then focus on the feeling yielding information at each point. Use the present tense, \"What do you see? What is your imme- diate reaction?\" \"Is there anything about the feeling?\" RECALL THE EVENTS IN A DIFFERENT ORDER Explain to the witness that it is natural for one to go through the incident from beginning to end, however, you would like him or her to start at the end and then go back to the beginning. You might start with something that impressed the witness most and then move for- ward or backward. Make use of the witness's change in context. Break up streams of activities, then back up. \"What is going on be- fore the door of the UFO opens?\" \"Describe everything about the scene.\" Then repeat, \"Is there anything else that you remember?\" \"Of what you have told me, what stands out?\" Go on to the next scene and repeat the process. This method is good at finding out lies, too. Lies are created and are in a logical order. Having the witness start at various stages confuses that order. As the truth is a matter of recall, not creation, the order of repeating can actually aid in the memory process. CHANGE PERSPECTIVE Have the witness attempt to recall the incident from another perspective, perhaps in the role of another indi- vidual who had significance in the event, or from a dif- ferent location relevant'to the event. \"If you were stand- ing where your dog was located what would you have seen?\" The witness might reply, \"I wouldn't have seen the emblem on the alien's uniform.\" Having the witness mentally change perspectives while recalling an incident, enhances the completeness of the report. Often a witness has a variety of perspec- tives on the incident, but most people will report what they remember from only one perspective. PHYSICAL APPEARANCE During the narrative phase of the investigation, the researcher might use specific techniques to obtain more detailed information. For example: \"Does the individual remind you of anyone that you know, a friend, a movie star?\" \"Try to think of why.\" \"Was there anything unusual about the individ- ual's clothing or appearance?\" When asking for facial descriptions get trait descriptions and go from there. \"Is it a pleasant face?\" \"What makes it pleasant?\" NAMES. Have the witness use the technique of going through the alphabet. \"How many syllables did the name have?\" \"What letter did the name start with?\" NUMBERS. \"Were numbers involved?\" \"Was it a high number or a low number?\" \"Were letters used along with the numbers?\" \"Were there colors involved?\" SPEECH CHARACTERISTICS. \"Was the voice rough? Pleasant?\" \"Was there any kind of accent?\" \"Does the voice remind you of anyone?\" \"If the voice reminds you of someone, why?\" CONVERSATION. \"Think about what was said ... were there any unusual words or phrases?\" \"What was your reaction to what was said?\" Have the witness de- scribe the tone of voice. \"Was the voice excited, threat- ening, young?\" Some practical hints include taking your witness in- terview notebook and writing on the inside cover meth- ods 1 through 4. Number 1, reconstruct the circum- stances, number 2, report everything, and so on. During the interview starting with number 1, title your notes. Then go to 2, then to 3, and then to 4. Don't skip around even if the witness seems repetitious. Remember the cognitive interview is systematic, and the order is im- portant. Make certain that questioning stays non-leading and non-directional, and deals only with what is related by the witness. For multiple witnesses, use the same techniques, but keep the witnesses separate. At the end of the interview, review your notes and then write your report.

As a researcher you have probably been using many of these techniques already. However, you will discover that you can greatly increase the amount of accurate information using all of the above methods. My personal research has demonstrated the value of the cognitive interview technique. I have found that the technique doesn't work as well when there is a complete mental block in memory as is common in the abduction phe- nomenon. Hypnotic memory retrieval techniques are best used in these cases. In a future issue of UFO EN- COUNTERS, you will find a profile on investigative hypnosis. REFERENCES: Reiser, Martin, 1980.

New Mexico is as good an allegory for the American spirit as any small town can be. All but lost on the eastern plains of New Mexico, it is out of the way from anywhere to anywhere else. That other American icon. Route 66, runs through the northern part of the state and Albuquerque. If the weather is bad. or you are going to Texas, you'll take the southern route through Lordsburg, Deming and Las Cruces on your way to El Paso. In between, on the far side of the Capitan and Sacramento mountain ranges from where the Rio Grande valley cuts the state in half, is Roswell, with a populace less than 45,000. You can trust your neighbors in Roswell. Generations who settled the city had to work hard together. People acknowledge one another on the street and outside of town will stop to help a vehicle in trouble. In exchange for the rigors of the remote locale they get air they can breathe, a future they can expect and a government they can trust. South of the town lies an industrial park located on the remains of the former Army Air Field that gave the city its dose of furtive notoriety. Just after World War II Roswell could boast the world's only atomic bomb squadron, the 509th Bomb Group. At the time such dis- tinction was no cause for public scrutiny. It's exactly the obscure location that would allow such a sensitive mil- itary asset to find a home in Roswell. But atomic bombers came and went and Roswell lapsed into the timeless small town routine that Ward Cleaver would call the good life. Then, in the middle seventies, odd stories began to surface about the activi- ties of the 509th in the summer of 1947. Twenty years and four books later, the name Roswell is now inextri- cably linked with the most remarkable set of allega- tions to be made in the dense web of public confusion that is the phenomenon of Unidentified Flying Objects. The investigators Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt claim that, at the height of a wave of sightings of flying crescent-shaped discs that swept across the country in the summer of 1947, one of the discs crashed into the base of a bluff about 35 miles northwest of the front gate of the air base. They also claim that, after securing the area, removing the debris, bribing and threatening the populace into secrecy, elements of the United States Government have managed to keep the fact that an ex- traterrestrial craft crashed there secret for nearly half a century. If indeed that is the case, it is about to change. Producer Paul Davids and Director Jeremy Kagan have made the movie that is to the still-obscure-by-normal- standards Roswell Incident what \"JFK\" was to the Kennedy Assassination. In doing so, Davids and Kagan have very nicely framed arguments about the existence of a cover-up and the reasons for one. Not to mention documenting the event for anyone with cable televi- sion or a VCR. If you have read the material, you will recognize \"Roswell\" as an accurate docudrama. If not, you might AUGUST 1994 NUMBER 316 PACE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Paul Davids. Executive Producer think it an intriguing bit of fiction. It is that blurry duality that represents the core problem in addressing the clear and substantial evidence of UFO's which points to tech- nology or other forces operating with a deliberate agenda of deception from a base outside our normal reality. It is too easy to dismiss accounts as fictional if they fall too far outside the parameters of common belief. And using fictional drama to present the best estimate of an un- known reality, such as Whitley Streiber did in his liter- ary treatment of the same case, \"Majestic,\" has the po- tential to add to the public's confusion as much as to en- lighten the masses. Writing a documentary screenplay about a mystery with no firm solution is a difficult task. Davids, the dri- ving force behind the project, has managed to do just that. The \"Roswell\" story is not one of aliens, but of one man's quest for truth and redemption. The searcher is an aging Major Jesse Marcel, (nicely played across several decades by Kyle MacLachlan) one of two army air corps officers to initially examine the debris and recog- nize it as not of this planet. As an element of the cover- up. Marcel was sworn to secrecy and then made to look the dunce by superior officers during a press conference. General Roger Ramey claimed the intelligence officer could not tell the difference between a spacecraft and a weather balloon. Over time. Marcel's duty to remain silent is at greater and greater odds with his sense of dig- nity and fairness. The docudrama unfolds during a 1970's reunion of the 509th, where Marcel takes the last opportunity of his life to query former squadron members and attempt to piece together the events of 1947. Bit by bit, pieces of the story are found, some coming quickly from casual observers, others dragged out of reluctant witnesses. Any one of them is at best a fuzzy memory. Not all of them fit together. Those that do have jagged edges. Some directly contradict others. The picture that forms confirms Marcel's opinion and provides a suggestion of an alien presence on earth much more serious than that proffered by the tabloid press. Along the way, the story mirrors the investigation of Randle and Schmitt. show- ing the difficulty of correlating different versions of events. Eventually, Marcel's curiosity gains him the attention of a shadowy figure played with appropriate self-confi- dence by Martin Sheen, who takes him to an abandoned hanger and sketches in the missing portions of the pic- ture. A crashed alien craft at the beginnings of a Cold War between the US and a paranoid super power. A clandestine effort to care for the one alien left alive and reverse engineering of the phenomenal craft. A rationale for secrecy to avoid provoking preemptive action by an all too human enemy. A self-reinforcing conundrum of deception and ridicule by now so convoluted that no sitting government could admit to having been involved in it. An escalation of explanation from the mundane to the inescapable. At the climatic moment we hope and pray that the blanket of denial will be torn away and the truth, whatever it is, will be laid bare. It is. Left to right: Xander Berkeley as Shennan Carson and Kyle MacLachlan as Jesse Marcel. PAGE 14 NUMBER 316 AUGUST 1994"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL You have to see the film to appreciate the cosmic irony of the hangar scene. I shall not reveal the logic that concludes the confrontation between one man searching for the truth and the nameless representative of his gov- ernment who dangles it before him. I will suggest you tape a copy of the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"First Contact\" and \"Roswell,\" then watch them back to back. The two stories are flip sides of the same coin. \"Roswell\" the movie has the honest look of a small town main street. Given the option of telling the story with the confines of a SHOWTIME budget or risking not telling it at all, Davids elected to do the former. The resulting focus on the people and the period in- stead of speculation-by-special-effects of what actually hit the ground on the night of July 4, 1947 helps the piece. In the tradition of \"Fire in the Sky,\" but without the studio's intrusion on the facts of the case, we see the effect of a very unusual event on the lives of generally usual people. The momentum of the story suffers occa- sionally from the process of maintaining consistency with the facts in the case. All in all \"Roswell\" is a good watch, as good as any in the summer cable line-up. The baseline of under- standing in the ongoing debate on-line and elsewhere about UFO's and E.T. has been raised. If you feel com- pelled to offer an opinion about extraterrestrial life and/or the capability of the government to keep secrets, make sure you have seen this movie and read the book by Randle and Schmitt before you do so or risk being flamed as a newbie. Davids presents the essential questions of the unre- solved UFO cover-up controversy very well indeed. While thankfully avoiding side issues such as the debate about one or two crash sites or the archaeologists pre- sented in the 1994 Randle and Schmitt book \"The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell,\" the movie touches all the bases dear to the UFO community. \"Roswell\" will give anyone—believer or hardened skeptic—pause for thought about the other side of the UFO issue. The closing scene shows a determined Marcel back at the crash site, making a final futile effort to find a solid piece of evidence, one tangible remainder of an event that has haunted him for years. As the sun sets behind the Capitans, Marcel realizes that no amount of hoping will uncover the lost piece of alien craft that would prove once and for all the government is lying. As we pull back to realize how vast the plains are and how hopeless his quest, we see Jesse Marcel as the best alle- gory for the American spirit any man can be. Watching the film makes it clear that if any of the al- leged incident is true, or something like it is, then the American public is the unknowing victim of the most heinous form of repression conceivable. Contact with extraterrestrial life is the most significant step a planetary civilization can take. The prospects for good are be- yond description. Who gets to make the decision that we who have settled this planet are not ready for the fact that we are not alone? The argument against an overtly aggressive alien presence is simple and persuasive. Given that they can get here, across interstellar dis- tances or dimensional shifts, then they have the tech- nology to wage a devastating war and win it decisively were that their purpose. Logic dictates a net non-aggressive position on the part of any alien race that may have already discov- ered us. More likely, they are waiting patiently for us to grow beyond the aggressive response patterns of our lower origins. Indeed, we may have committed the most grievous error of welcoming the early reconnaissance of visitors from other worlds with attempts to shoot their craft down. Extraterrestrial contact, if or when it occurs, is too important to be left to government, least of all paranoid elements of the intelligence community in whose hands \"Roswell\" (and most of the UFO commu- nity) claims it lays. What the movie offers is an appreciation of how the truth could be hidden more or less in plain sight, var- nished with a thin layer of denial and ridicule. It is also clear that whatever the case may have been in the 1940's, if a coverup was started at that time, it is by now so in- grown that only an extremely clear political message from the people in whose name the secret is being kept can provide the impetus to end it. \"Roswell\" is a movie that took a lot of perseverance and moxie to make. The consequences of it being even close to the truth are too profound to be dismissed. If you don't dismiss it as an in- triguing fiction then download the Roswell Declaration on America Online, sign it and send it in. In that manner, the consequences of making \"Roswell\" will be worth the investment and risk the filmmakers have taken. Killing a president is one thing. Denying a society the truth about their place in the cosmos and, possibly, their origins is another. No amount of investigation or reve- lation will bring John Kennedy back to life or change our history back to what it might have been had he not been shot. But the revelation of the facts about what happened at Roswell is the reversal of policy needed to make things right with our growth as a species. The cold war is over. The world is still in crisis, but the enemy is an- archy, not totalitarianism. Any justification for a cover- up of the sort depicted in \"Roswell\" no longer exists. Whatever happened outside Roswell, the govern- ment has not properly explained it. To this day, new ex- planations are still arriving, all of which are contrived and unsatisfactory. And whatever it was, it scared the gov- ernment so much that extraordinary measures were tak- en to hide it from the American people. If you have any threads of the spirit of '76 in your soul, if you can explain to your children why they held the Boston Tea Party— or worse yet, if you can't—then watch this movie.

For the de- bunkers, it's a demonstration that reports of small grays with big eyes have no mote validity than Arthur Conan Doyle's fairy photographs, or Weekly Wo rid News' latest two-headed baby. For some ufologists, its evidence that UFOs and their occupants occupy some uncertain state between the physical and psychic worlds. Other ufolo- gists prefer we keep our enquiries to post-1947, where more tangible evidence is to be found. The debate between the \"nuts and bolts\" and the \"elves and archetypes\" crowds is often felt to be a hol- low one in that it takes away from the productive time ot gathering evidence. However, what evidence there is Mill inquires interpretation at some stage, and the Balkanization of ufology continues, with the usual con- sequences of entrenched viewpoints and bruised egos. Is the UFO a craft, or a \"window\"? Whatever its na- ture, the UFO acts as a mobile Rorschach blot, allowing us to project our fears and hopes on it. The \"elves and archetypes\" crowd uses this argument to their advantage, extending it to an operational principle: the particle/wave duality in quantum physics is said to find its epistemo- logical twin in the UFO. Depending on the question we ask it, the mysterious object is either retrospectively a metallic craft or a bad dream. What's interesting is the way mis hoary old debate is now playing itself out among current researchers, par- ticularly those involved in studying abduction reports. The ambiguous nature of the phenomenon threatens to make theologians of us all, nattering away like me- dieval scholastics on the nature of angels. I mean that quite explicitly. Consider the work of Budd Hopkins, and more particularly, David Jacobs. Nothing good at least on the persona) level is seen from the invasive procedures of cold, clinical ETs. Yet Whitley Strieber, or John Mack, can find transformational, transpersonal material in the abductee's experience that allows for spiritual growth. The spliinng and overlapping of viewpoints in ufol- ogy can ^ot quite Byzantine. At a recent conference in Seattle I listened to former Las Vegas news producer Geoige knapp say how he can accept quite a bit in the UFO rumour mill, but draws the line at channelled mes- sages from abductees. I then heard John Mack, who is more sanguine about channelled messages, address an incredulous question to Knapp about crashed discs, a topic presumably a bit too overtly extraterrestrial for the Harvard prof. Where one researcher's paradigm stops, another's begins. In a recent issue of Mondo 2000, writer Terence McKenna, (who believes interdimensional entities can be contacted by masting psychoactive substances), de- scribes John Mack as a 'screwball\" for thinking that re- ports of implants in abductees are genuine. To those few debunkers paying attention, it must all seem like a great waste of time, like a bunch of bald old men fighting over a comb. The upshot of all this is that there is as yet no science of ufology. There is a scientific topic —UFOs—and there are researchers using the tools of science, but what we have today is closer to a theology than a sci- ence. The theology of ufology, at this point, has as its clerics a mishmash of popes, antipopes, bishops and heretics. On the one hand, we have the upholders of the mystical, gnostic order, those like Jacque Vallee or John Keel, who hold that the phenomenon of UFOs is a pro- jection from a paranormal realm swollen with imagery from the collective unconscious. On the other hand, we have the fundamentalists like Stanton Friedman and Timothy Good, who argue that these are discrete craft from a neighbouring star system. Plus there's the mil- lennialist visions of the Bills (Lear and Cooper), who, wandering around in the deserts of Nevada, fulminate about underground Hells run by evil ETs. But fear not, deliverance is only a short hyperspace jump away to the Heavenly realm of the Pleiades, and the peaceful, blonde \"nordic types\" of contactee Billy Meier. Of course, no system of belief is complete without its complementary non-believers. The atheism of the de- bunkers is perhaps the most potent belief system of all, robust enough to deny the demonstrable miracles and graces recorded on videotape and radar screens. (The de- bunker's faith in scientism will be sorely tried if evi- dence for the Roswell crash—ufology's own Shroud of Turin—is ever finally authenticated ) I don't mean to be facetious in suiiyc-^mg there is a theological bent in today's ufology h makes no differ- ence to the reality of the phenomenon aselt. The Babel of conflicting languages we find ourselves in, and the fractured UFO theology, may well be a function of the phenomenon. If Jacques Vallee was right in seeing a pattern of scheduled reinforcement in waves of sightings —sight- ings that likely stretch far back into the mists of prehis- tory—then perhaps we wouldn't be surprised at the cur- rent situation. Whether or not UFOs are extraterrestrial or something else entirely, the reconstruction of reli- gion and mythology seems to be one of its most sub- stantial by-products, even if it's an unintended conse- quence of \"their\" influence. Consider the \"mysterium tremendum\" of the ab- ductee's experiences, with its strange reported mix of terror and love, so reminiscent of the stories of \"experi- encers\" in the Old Testament. Consider the ambiguous PACE 18 NUMBER 316 AUGUST 1994"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL evidence of implants and marks on the bodies of ab- ductees, so parallel to the folklore of shamanism and witchcraft. How can we be iinyihmg but theologians? Or at best, alchemists, fitfully Mruivjling with our own ig- norance and the nascent makings of a new science. If ufology is as yet not a irue anence, but a theology of sorts, that puts those of us doing research in the field in the position of a theocracy, a priesthood. We may be unwittingly midwiving a new religion into being for the next millenium, with all the attendant dangers and re- sponsibilities that implies. In calling ufologists a priest- hood I don't mean to diminish the intentions, or quality, of the work being done. One could argue that the main- stream scientific establishment is the greatest priest- hood of all. But just as Darwin and Mendel's work was twisted in a fairly short time into eugenics and Aryanism, we may find some uncomfortable mass be- liefs dissemenated from the foundation of ufological study. (There is certainly an undercurrent of right-wing ideology, and the chosen-people myth, in the contactee stories of the fifties.) Alternately, or simultaneously, we may see the emer- gence of a new gnostic, \"Gaian\" mythos, with the UFO as its mandala. Abductees tend to take a high interest in ecological issues, and various \"new age\" ideas. Though normally they're non-joiners, suspicious of organized re- ligion 4 ; iheir influence on the overall culture is harder to g, in go feu doing research in ufology would like to think of themselves aiding and abetting the emergence of a new world mythos, but that's exactly what we may doing, with more than a little help from above. Certainly the UFO phenomenon has proven itself to be subtle and sophisti- cated enough to push the process along, with all of us, re- searchers and debunkers, believers and non-believers, as co-conspirators in some ongoing cosmic caper. —Geoff Olson Vancouver, British Columbia COME TOGETHERI In the past couple of years I've seen some disturbing trends evolving in the UFO research community, trends that have forced me to feel isolated, disillusioned, and, at times, even hopeless about our ability as researchers to ever bring ourselves closer to the threshold of truth. Having two choices, one of immobilization and one of action, I have decided on the latter and offer up these five simple ideas to all my colleagues and fellow deep thinkers and shadow chasers. Again, they are sim- ple...but they are crucial if we are to strengthen and unify our investigative efforts. 1. Question authority! Including our own. No one is an expert on the unknown, and no one can possibly own the conversation on UFOs. We cannot take every- thing we are told by either skeptic or believer at face value, just as we cannot trust most of what we are told by our own governing agencies. 2. Find the fence and ride it! In line with #1, we must remain both open-minded and skeptical. 1 call it \"healthy skepticism,\" and urge all of my colleagues to cultivate it quickly. Only by using a balance of intellect and instinct will we be able to best deal with the issues and evidence placed before us. Find that comfort zone on the fence and get your balance. How better to keep an eye on both sides of the ever-unfolding UFO phenome- non? 3. Share! Open those lines of communication and share information, case studies and evidence instead of jealously guarding it so nobody else can steal your glory. Hey, folks, check your egos in at the door. If you want to be a star, you came to the wrong place. 4. Celebrity or subject matter? Like I said, if you wanna be a star, go to Hollywood. What are we focusing on here? Seems much more attention is being paid to specific lecturers and researchers that the body of work they are doing (which, in some cases, is bodiless). If we want to be taken seriously as researchers, if we truly want to find out the truth about UFOs, if we sincerely want to advance our field of science, why don't we start acting more like scientists and less like hotshot celebrities and wanna-be-stars. I'm really starting to wonder, what is the true motivation of some of these so- called UFO experts flooding the lecture halls? Attention??? Or the spread of knowledge and education? Go figure ... 5. Hypnotherapists, Heal Thy selves! Perhaps the most important, and most disturbing, trend I have noticed (along with many of my like-minded colleagues) is a distressing influx of poorly and/or inadequately trained hypnotherapists into the abductee marketplace. I hate to sound so commercial, but that's what I see happening, a real common, ulization of what I feel is a very serious and often djni'erous phenomenon. In the past year alone I have st'en hypnotherapists who hand out business cards with glamour head shots (what are you, a model or a hypnotherapist?); hypnotherapists who go under a cutesy singular name, like Madonna; questionnaires for the general public that are so leading they would con- vince anyone of being an abductee; even discount coupons for hypnosis sessions! Hey, folks, 1 hear K- MART is having a blue light special! Get two abductions for the price of one!!! This is not a beauty contest, a popularity contest (\"I've been on Donahue more than you have, Nya, nya, nya!!!\"), or any easy money-making scheme. This is a serious field of study, and by looking at the severely lacking educational backgrounds and training of some of these so-called hypnotherapists, many of whom claim certification based on a couple of weekend courses or a six-month stay at the local hypnosis institute (yes, folks, in many states that's all that's required for \"certifica- tion\"), I think it's fair to say that we are placing the men- tal safety of abductees into incapable hands. This is both irresponsible, and dangerous. There are many AUGUST 1994 NUMBER 3 16 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL highly qualified and well-trained individuals currently out there, with strong backgrounds in the fields of psy- chology, human behavior and related areas, and many others who through sheer dedication and personal re- sponsibility have read and studied the subject matter in order to provide a service to people who need it. Perhaps in the future, UFO organizations should de- mand more stringent qualifications and credentials of the hypnotherapists they work with and recommend. It won't keep all the charlatans, wanna-bees and atten- tion addicts out of the picture, but it's a start. So, there it is, in five easy pieces.

Thanks for listening. —Marie Jones Burbank, CA U MEANS UNIDENTIFIED Because of the scarcity of incontrovertible and enig- matic material evidence as well as conclusive, scientif- ically definitive instrument-recorded UFO data, re- searchers study UFO reports, rather than UFOs per se. This situation presents a serious problem that should be acknowledged by responsible ufologists who speculate on the nature and origin of the UFO phenomenon. A UFO report attempts to reconstruct, using witness narrative description (primarily), a coherent account of a short-duration event or series of events which, ac- cording to the witness, appeared to contradict currently accepted paradigms of contemporary physics and/or vi- olate his or her own sense of reality. Unfortunately, the report invariably contains witness perceptual and mem- ory errors as well as witness/investigator communica- tions and/or documentation-related errors. It can also be contaminated by the cultural mind set, expectations and wishful thinking of both the witness and the investigator. Moreover, the possibility that some UFO sightings can be attributed to deliberately \"staged\" events perpetrated by sources unknown also must be acknowledged. A typical UFO report thus constitutes an inherently flawed representation of the event or stimulus responsi- ble for the sighting. Depending on myriad factors, some reports will be more reliable and contain more factual in- formation than others. The late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who served as the chief scientific consultant to all of the U.S. Air Force's public UFO investigation programs, was acutely aware of this fact. Indeed, he considered it to be the fundamental problem of UFO research. Hynek expressed his concern about the validity of witness tes- timony as a simple yet strikingly profound question: \"Did what the witnesses say happened really happen in the way they said it happened?\" The implications of this question, together with the knowledge that approx- MUFON 1994 SYMPOSIUM - Continued from Page 10 John C. \"Jack\" Kaxher, Ph.D. imately 90% of all raw UFO reports have a conventional explanation, should serve as a constant, sobering reality check for all UFO researchers and investigators who ex- hibit an uncritical, face-value acceptance of UFO-related claims. If the reported anomalous event remains unidentified after (to the extent feasible) a thorough and unbiased in- vestigation consistent with the comprehensive proto- cols delineated in the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, all we can say with a reasonable degree of confidence is that a \"true UFO\" was seen. Nothing fur- ther can be said about the nature or origin of the object or light reported. As Dr. Hynek stated repeatedly, the \"U\" in UFO simply means unidentified! We cannot ex- trapolate beyond this provisional evaluation (which itself can be downgraded to an Identified Flying Object status upon further review of existing or subsequently gathered testimony, records or hard evidence) and conclude that the UFO observed was an extraterrestrial craft. It could be a spaceship, but that's all we can say about it. An evaluation of the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) or any other hypothesis cannot be performed in a sci- entific manner until indisputable physical evidence is made available to qualified researchers. This evidence could then be independently subjected to rigorous, com- prehensive, and controlled replicate testing and analysis. The ETH is just one possible explanation among the many different hypotheses that have been postulated in an attempt to ascertain what UFOs really are. All we can say now is that the data gathered thus far does not seem to reflect a manifestation of our current technology nor fit the parameters of what is commonly known about our own world. Something very unusual is hap- pening on this planet but exactly what that \"something\" is remains a mystery. —Robert A.

MUFON Annual Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Advancement of the UFO Phenomenon It is with the deepest gratitude that I accept this award from my many colleagues, the members of MU- FON. The democratic basis of your decision makes the honor even more precious to me. I would be here to re- ceive the award except for a complicated schedule this month, culminating in my first one-man exhibition of paintings and collages in quite some time. My show opens in three weeks in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and because of my odd dual professional life must tem- porarily take precedence over attending this conference. I would not be telling the truth if I did not admit that the work 1 do with UFO abductees — the work that many of us do — is hard, sad, and often discouraging. Yet, if lives are helped even a little, the emotional rewards for me are immense. This honor from my colleagues makes the difficult work even more worthwhile. I have asked Linda Cortile to accept this award for me. She stands as a symbol of personal courage and strength, particularly in the light of the sufferings she, her husband and children have had to endure in recent years. We must never forget that all of those who are joined with me in this crucially important labor — Linda, her family, and you, our many colleagues — have the most powerful weapon of all on our side — the sim- ple, unassailable truth. Eventually science and society as a whole will be forced to consider our discoveries. In the meantime, patience, kindness and hard work will see us through, until the world at last can see what we have known for many years. Again, my heartfelt thanks. - Budd Hopkins AUGUST 1994 NUMBER 316 PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Walter N. Webb SEPTEMBER 1994 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus, though low in the WSW twilight sky, achieves great- est brilliancy in the evening sky on the 28th at magnitude -4.6. The imposing planet sets about 8 PM daylight time in mid- September and about 7:30 toward the end of the month. It forms a nice pair with the lunar crescent on the 8th. Jupiter (-1.8), in Libra, lies in the same region of the sky as Venus. The crescent Moon, after passing the brighter planet the night before, stands a few degrees below Jupiter on September 9. The giant sets in the W about three-quarters of an hour behind Venus. Saturn (0.5), in Aquarius, is opposite the Sun on the 1st and thus rises in the E about sunset, remaining visible all night in the southern sky. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars ( 1 . 1 ). in Gemini, shows signs of brightening this month as our Earth begins to overtake it. The reddish body rises in the NE about I AM in midmonth, moving to a point high in the ESE by dawn. Saturn sets in the W about sunrise. The Solar Polar Probe: A NASA/European Space Agency probe named Ulysses con- tinues its unique odyssey to explore both poles of the Sun from above them. After launch in October 1990, the spacecraft was deliberately hurled out of the solar system's orbital plane by Jupiter's gravity in February 1992 and back toward the Sun. The space slingshot positioned Ulysses about 200 million miles above the Sun's S pole this month and 80° below the so- lar system plane — the highest out-of-plane latitude ever achieved by an Earth-launched object. After studying our star's polar atmosphere, magnetic fields, solar wind, and other particles, the probe will survey the Sun's N pole next year. Moon Phases: New moon September 5 First quarter September 12 Full moon September 19. .. Harvest Moon Last quarter September 27 The Stars: With the approach of the fall season, during midevening hours the Great Square of Pegasus ascends high in the SE. Diaper-shaped Capricornus the Sea Goat straddles the celes- tial meridian in the S. The rest of the dim constellations of \"The Sea\" — Piscis Austrinus the Southern Fish, Aquarius the Water Bearer, Pisces the Fish, and Cetus the Whale — fol- low close behind Capricornus. The Summer Triangle remains a prominent sight high in the S. In the N the Big Dipper slides ever closer to the horizon. Curving westward from the North Star is the much fainter Little Dipper. Between the Little Dipper and the crooked \"W\" of Cassiopeia the Queen lies her less noticeable consort, Cepheus the King, shaped something like an upside-down house with a peaked roof. Be aware of the following near-horizon objects of mid- evening, low enough to be subject to refraction effects and therefore false UFO reports: Arcturus (in WNW), Antares (in WSW), Saturn and Fomalhaut (in SE). and Capella (in NE).

FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL OUT OF PRINT The third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is temporarily out-of-print. It has been removed from the MUFON Publications List. Work is progress- ing very well on publishing an expanded version to be identified as the fourth edition in the near future. Please do not delay conducting Field Investigator training classes due to the absence of the fourth edition. Some sections or chapters of the present manual are only be- ing updated, whereas new sections on abduction inves- tigations, animal mutilations, crop circles, and poly- graph will be added. Explicit instructions on completing Form 1 and Form 2 will also be new. The expanded sec- tion on interviewing witnesses by Dan Wright will be another asset to the new manual. The availability date and price will be announced in the Journal. Please do not back order the new manual since it will be doubled in size, and the price has not been determined from the printer. We are excited about the fourth edition, since it will be a state-of-the art pub- lication. FINANCIAL BREAKTHROUGH IN UFO RESEARCH A coalition council composed of the officers or repre- sentatives of the three major UFO groups in the United States—CUFOS, FUFOR and MUFON—has been or- ganized to administer cooperative grants for UFO re- search projects.
