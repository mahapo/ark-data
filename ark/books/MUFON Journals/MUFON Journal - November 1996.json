Sample of Mokume Cane-style jewelry by Randy Fullbright. Phow by Miller Johnson. most readers are no doubt aware, a metal fragment purported to have been recovered from the Roswell crash de- bris site drew worldwide attention last March. An analysis to determine its element composition was arranged at the New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources by Max Littell of the International UFO Museum and Research Center. The X-ray fluorescence analysis de- termined the 1.616-gram fragment to be a combination of Cu (copper) and Ag (silver) with trace elements of sodium, aluminum, silicon, iron, chromium, sulfur and chlorine. The UFO Museum subsequently received a second fragment from the same source. How would a combination of silver and copper best be utilized? Speculation from a number of creditable sources indicated su- perconductivity as a strong contender. This is, of course, very interesting, but the frag- ments' origins were still unknown. More tests were needed. After conferring with Prof. C. B. Moore, I was convinced an isotopic analysis would be my recommendation to the officers of the UFO Museum. Such an analysis requires a very sophisticated piece of equipment called a Thermal lonization Mass Spectrometer (TIMS). We acquired a worldwide listing of laboratories equipped with TIMS through the Internet. This instrument is unique in its ability to measure the isotopic ratios of a given element. X-ray fluorescence had al- ready provided us with the fragment's com- position of copper, silver and trace ele- ments. Once the isotopic ratios are calcu- lated, they can be compared to the terrestrial ratios. If the fragment's ratios vary from the terrestrial numbers by 0.5% to 1% or more, they could be considered positive proof of an extraterrestrial origin. Numbers within the Earthly range, however, do not rule out the possibility of extraterrestrial origin, they just render it considerably less likely. From the listing of laboratories equipped with TIMS, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LAND was my unquestionable first choice for contact for obvious reasons, including its reputation as well as its prox- imity in our own state. I prepared a letter of inquiry to E. Larry Callis, Team Leader, Mass Spectrometry, and faxed it to him on May 17, 1996. Four days later I followed up with a telephone call, and negotiations be- gan. In the beginning, as expected, there was some resistance to a UFO-related analysis from LANL's Public Affairs Office. I firmly believe that the museum's quest for scientific evidence was paramount in over- coming any opposition. Working through the lab's Industrial Partnership Center, a \"Limited Scope Technical Assistance Agreement\" between LANL and the International UFO Museum was written, and delivered to me on June 14. Acting on behalf of the museum, I signed the agree- ment and returned it with the museum's check to LANL. The analysis date was set for August 1, with August 2 as a backup if See also: • Roswell, the Metal Fragment Incident by Miller Johnson, June 1996, pp. 13-15 • Museum: UFO Piece Jewelry Scrap by John Fleck, Albuquerque Journal, September 20, 1996, p.

Larry Callis, with years of experi- ence, predicted additional time would be re- quired. He was correct. August first was slow-arriving, but sud- denly we, my wife Marilyn and I, were checking in at LANL's Badge Office, which already had our names in the computer as approved visitors. From there it was a short drive to the Chemical Metallurgical Research building. Larry Callis met us at the guard station, and after proper clear- ance, we, along with LANL's video journal- ist, John Bass, were escorted into the build- ing and through another guard station. Outsiders, especially laymen like Marilyn and me, rarely gain access to the CMR facility, so it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The building's interior from a bygone era seemed technically out of step with the scientific intellect and equipment that are probably unequalled anywhere else in the world. Reaching the TIMS lab, scien- tists and visitors alike are required to don a lab coat and a pair of booties before enter- ing. Leaving the lab, these items are surren- dered each time and a radiation check re- quired before exiting the area. Safety regu- lations are stringent, respected and cau- tiously observed. August first was full and exhausting, but an exciting day. We had anticipated a com- pletion of the lab work while there that first day, however, some minor calibration inac- curacies on the copper indicated the need for another day of lab work. We exited the lab at 5:00 p.m.. had dinner in Santa Fe and were home in Albuquerque at 8:00 p.m. T he next morning we were back in the lab at 9:25 as progress continued. Cali- bration inaccuracies had been corrected, and the remainder of the day went smoothly. By midafternoon the test was completed and we bid farewell to our new friends. LANL had granted the museum's re- quest, as a matter of record, to have the analysis proceedings videotaped. John Bass from Media Relations was there on the first day using his creative talent to document the lab activity. I was permitted to use the lab's 35mm camera to record the proceed- ings on both days. Two fragments were analyzed by Larry Callis, assisted by his team of Crail Ham- mond, Nan Saponara, John Alarid and Phillip Noll. Prior to the analysis, another member of his group. Bill Hutchinson, had made several photomicrographs of the frag- ments. The two fragments will be referred to as fragment #l and fragment #2. Each is a small snippet from the two originals. As a result of the test at LANL, it was deter- mined that the two fragments are mates, al- lowing any future \"destructive\" analyses to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Crail Hammond, right \\vith LANL Mass Spectrometer and Miller Johnson.

The following paragraphs and scientific- data of the isotopic analysis were prepared at LANL by Callis and faxed to me on August 15: \"The samples were analyzed using a Thermal lonization Mass Spectrometer, Model VG-354 manufactured by Fisons-VG Instruments. England. This instrument is nor- mally used at the Lab to provide high-preci- sion analyses of nuclear materials. With this instrument, one is able to separate the iso- topes of selected elements according to mass, and count very precisely the relative amounts of each isotope of the element. Most ele- ments, copper and silver among them, con- sist of mixtures of atoms having different masses (or weights). Ordinary copper for ex- ample consists of a mixture of copper atoms having relative masses '63' and '65.' Both types of atoms are 'copper' — that is they have the same chemical and physical proper- ties — they differ only in mass (or weight). In ordinary copper we find, using the mass spectrometer, that about 70% of the copper atoms have mass '63' and about 30% have mass '65.' Mass spectroscopists like to think in terms of 'isotope ratios,' which in the case of copper, is simply the ratio of the number of atoms having mass '63' to those having mass '65.' For ordinary (terrestrial) copper, the 'accepted value' for this ratio is 2.244. (This is the value determined by the interna- tional scientific community to be typical of materials found on the Earth). Isotope ratios are usually written as 63Cu/65Cu. 'Cu' being the scientific symbol for copper. Similarly, silver consists of two isotopes having masses of'107' and '109.' This ratio is written 107Ag/109Ag, 'Ag' being the symbol for sil- ver. The 'accepted value' for the silver ratio is 1.0764. \"In thermal ionization mass spectrome- try. samples are introduced into the mass spectrometer by placing small quantities (a few micrograms. or millionths of a gram) of the sample onto a fiat metallic ribbon called a 'filament.' When an electrical current is passed through this 'filament,' heat is pro- duced, much like in a light bulb, which causes the sample to vaporize and produce 'ions,' or electrically charged atoms, which can then be analyzed (or measured) by the mass spectrometer. \"Because copper and silver are very easy to electroplate out of solution, this tech- nique was used for placing the sample onto the filaments. Electroplating also allows one to separate the copper from the silver be- cause silver can be plated at a lower voltage than copper. In this manner the silver part of the sample was placed on one filament while the copper was placed on a separate filament. The two loaded filaments were \"For the frag- ment sam- ples to be de- scribed as 'unusual,' the measured isotope ratios would need to be well outside the range of pos- sible Earthly values, say, at least 0.5% to 1 % differ- ence.

Unfortunately, time did not per- mit the analysis of 'Fragment #2' for silver, but the agreement between the copper re- sults on the two samples is very good. \"For copper, the terrestrial refined metal sample and the fragment samples also agree quite well, although both types of samples differ slightly from the 'accepted value' (about -.2%). Unfortunately, copper isotopic abundances have not been extensively stud- ied by the scientific community to deter- mine what sort of natural variations there are, if any, between various sources of cop- per on the Earth. Published values indicate a range of a few tenths of one percent may be possible. Hence, for the Fragment samples to be described as 'unusual,' the measured isotope ratios would need to be well outside the range of possible Earthly values, say, at least 0.5% to 1% difference. This is cer- tainly not the case for either copper or silver in the fragment samples.\" stated in the above analysis, the fragments' isotopic ratios are not unusual. They are typical of terrestrial val- ues. There were, however, some unusual circumstances that still required answers. In conjunction with the isotopic analysis, we were able to secure a bonus of several cross section optical micrographs of each frag- ment. This process creates a digital color picture image of the cross section and is achieved by embedding the subject matter in epoxy. It is then carefully sanded and pol- ished to reveal its structural detail before the color picture image is created. Fragment #2 is composed of eight alternating layers of silver and copper, which in itself is unusual, considering the material thickness of 0.01 inch. Fragment #1 was even more baffling, for within its material thickness of 0.015 inch, nineteen alternating layers of silver and copper were documented. A quest for the facts has been an ongoing endeavor since late March when the first fragment made its debut. EPILOGUE On September 5, 1996,1 had several tele- phone conversations with John Fleck, Albuquerque Journal staff writer, regarding the fragment mystery. It was evident that John was onto something.

Founder in the mid-80s of the Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), Ford became known for his relentless investiga- tions of UFO events and for his startling al- legations that alien craft had come down on Long Island three times in recent years and been retrieved by federal and local authori- ties. The Suffolk County Long Island Police Department is one of the agencies John ac- cused. John said the police helped recover a fiery object witnesses told John came down in Long Island's Southhaven Park in 1992. John made this claim at public meetings up and down Long Island, and he held a demonstration at Police Headquarters. About a year ago scary things started happening to John Ford. He repeatedly phoned friends and said someone was ha- rassing him and maybe, he thought, trying to kill him. Was there a campaign to desta- bilize John Ford? If so, it reached its climax June 12, when John was arrested in a sting operation in- volving phone taps and a \"wired\" paid in- formant. Police charged John with conspir- acy to murder and possession of radium without a license. Suffolk DA James Catterson told news reporters John Ford planned to murder an individual by the name of John Powell, head of the Suffolk County Republican Party, by putting ra- dioactive radium in his toothpaste. An improbable charge, to put it mildly. Nonetheless, the DA seemed unable to re- strain himself in the media following John's arrest. He sponsored two press conferences, compared John to the Unabomber, and made additional charges against John for which no indictments were subsequently re- turned. Amid a flood of sensational news, John's bail was set at half a million dollars. Naturally, he hasn't been able to raise it. In the meantime, the UFO community, unused to investigators being arrested and charged with crimes, has met this unsettling drama with a stunned silence. Nor has John, on advice of his attorney, issued any state- ment in his own defense other than his plea of not guilty. Not mentioned in the newspapers was John's claim of harassment, of himself and others in LIUFON: auto accidents (too many), vandalism of cars, and a physical at- tack on LIUFON member Joe Mazzuchelli, who was arrested with John June 12. Mazzuchelli says last winter four men dragged him out of John's truck, beat him up, and warned him to \"stay out of our busi- ness.\" Such are the allegations in this case. What is the truth? Is UFO investigator John Ford a potential murderer? Or is John the victim of a political arrest? Was he set up by people local to the Island or higher—people who got a little tired of John Ford's inces- sant allegations? W hat were John's allegations? As any- one familiar with John knows, they were radical. For example, John believed that in 1989 Americans forced down an alien craft over Moriches Bay Long Island. He believed that in 1992 an alien craft crashed in Southhaven Park on the Island. And he considered the possibility that in 1995 another mysterious object came to earth in the Pine Barrens area of the Island and that \"diversionary fires\" were set to dis- tract public attention. John claimed the technology used to down the alien craft in 1989 came from Brookhaven National Laboratory on the Island. Based on his sightings investiga- tions, John concluded UFOs were making regular flights over populated Hudson Valley and Long Island, much to the con- sternation of the coverup, which decided to do something about it. John further believed the Long Island police, fire, parks and other local agencies were commandeered by the federals to assist in these emergency opera- tions and then, naturally, gagged. John claimed he had \"sources\" in the Police and Fire Departments who privately told him information on which he built his cases. And there were non-confidential wit- nesses, members of the public, who told John, for example, about a fireball coming to earth in Southhaven Park, about fire truck and police cars that night, and that the Park was closed afterward.

November 1996 Number 343 PageS Police Departments denied it and the Park director said the Park was never closed. The details of John's cases are too numerous to cover here, but one treatment of the Moriches Bay case can be found in Len Stringfield's Status Report VI. The thing about John was he wouldn't shut up. He went all over Long Island talk- ing about a coverup of UFO events in which local authorities were deeply implicated. John founded LIUFON about 1985. From then on, he maintained a hot line. He inves- tigated sightings and abductions. He held public meetings. He talked to the press. He sponsored conferences. He held demonstra- tions, he published a newsletter, he leaflet- ted. John was tireless. I know John Ford, and he is the most determined UFO investi- gator I ever met. He also has flaws, plenty of them. He is stubborn, for example. Yet John Ford's friends all attest he lived a moral life and never, as far as anyone can remember, threatened another person with bodily harm. According to John's attorney, John Rouse of Central Islip, ''You can't believe how many people have called me to say they can't en- vision John Ford killing anyone, or even conceiving the intention.\" Murder wasn't in John's character, peo- ple say, and breaking the law wasn't John's style. John Ford was a law and order advo- cate who spent most of his career as a Court Officer in the Suffolk County court system. John knew the law and how to use it. John was litigious, not violent. If John Ford had a gnpe against you, he'd sue you in a minute. Nor is John stupid. Even the Suffolk DA called John a \"mastermind.\" If John was go- ing to kill someone, would he use radium? It hardly kills people fast. Readers will re- call the famous radium dial painters of the 1920s who licked radium paint brushes for 40 years before they got cancer. Yet the DA would have us believe that John's \"murder weapon\" was radium. Toothpaste goes fast in a household of four people, like that of alleged murder target John Powell. Was Ford going to break in and put radium in Powell's toothpaste every week for 40 years until Powell got cancer? And would an individual who thought people were watching him leave illegal ra- dium in the back of a pickup truck in front of his house? I repeat, John knew the law. The charges against John strain credibil- ity, but that didn't seem to embarrass the DA. As I mentioned. Catterson was so eager to incriminate John that he made several se- rious charges at his press conferences for which no indictments were returned. \"This,\" says attorney John Rouse, \"is called poison- ing the jury pool.\" Catterson's overstep raises questions: Did the DA believe he had more evidence against John than he ended up with? How good is the remaining evidence? Is it possi- ble the DA never thought he had evidence to convict John of anything, and that in- stead, the purpose of the arrest is simply to ruin John Ford's reputation and wipe him out financially with legal bills? T he purported case against John rests on the taped conversation made in John's house the night of his arrest. According to police, the wired informant engaged in con- versation with John and Joe Mazzuchelli about doing away with Powell and another local politician via the radium in the tooth- paste route. After this the police, who were waiting outside, burst in and arrested John and Joe. The tape has now been released on dis- covery. \"It's unintelligible,\" says Preston Nichols, John's friend in LIUFON. \"All I can clearly hear on that tape,\" Nichols says, \"is the informant talking and John laughing like whatever they're talking about is a big joke.\" Attorney John Rouse doesn't disagree. He's waiting for an \"enhanced\" version of the tape to see if the conversation becomes clearer. Rouse warns, however, that John's situation is serious. If a jury believes the DA's charges, John Ford could get 25-75 years at an upstate NY prison. As for the radium, it was allegedly found outside in John's truck. Outside is where the police were, waiting and listening to the in- formant talking with John and Joe. Could the police have planted the radium? And finally, unless John was to be en- couraged and entrapped, why use an infor- mant at all? If the police believed John was plotting a murder, why not bug his house for a couple of weeks and get the whole scoop? The answer might be that the purpose of the informant was to lead the conversation in an incriminating direction. I have in my files a letter from the Suffolk County Police Department, dated April 1993.1 wrote to them, at John's re- quest, complaining about police violations of LIUFON member's civil rights. They had been leafletting near Southhaven Park and"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL going house to house looking for wit- nesses—constitutionally protected activity. The police stopped them and ordered them out of the area. This was the kind of thing John did, and this was the kind of response he got from the Suffolk Police, as far back as 1993. There is plenty of reason to think the Suffolk Police were \"out to get\" John Ford. And no member of the UFO community can be confident they understand the arrest of John Ford if their only source of informa- tion is the sensational media reports orches- trated by the Suffolk DA. That is why John's colleagues, including myself in Washington, DC, L1UFON vice president Steve lavarone, and Tony West, Richard Jones, Preston Nichols, and Joe Zuppardo in New York, Don Jernigan of Ohio, and Kelly Freeman of Florida, have organized the John Ford Defense Committee. Our purpose is (1) to give peo- ple true information on the arrest of John Ford, and (2) collect funds and other re- sources essential for John's defense. M y support for John Ford, and the sup- port of the other members of the Defense Committee, is based on our convic- tion that John did not, would not, and could not conspire to murder anyone. On this point our support is complete and total. As for John's allegations, I speak only for myself and not for other members of the Defense Committee. I always found John's allegations hard to believe but impossible to dismiss—because John had evidence and what he claimed was perfectly possible. Taken as a whole, what John Ford's claims suggest is a low intensity military conflict between the United States and the aliens. Is that possible? Yes it is. Just because John's allegations \"fit\" doesn't make them true. But the fact is, John had evidence. John claimed three events on Long Island. Even if he was wrong on two of them, if he was right on only one, John had a tiger by the tail. If so, it's no surprise somebody would try to destroy John Ford. And there's that curious coincidence about Moriches Bay, which more than a few persons have pointed out. Moriches Bay is where John said the United States brought down an alien craft in 1989, and Moriches Bay is where TWA Flight 800 mysteriously crashed in August. The cause of that crash, readers are aware, has so far eluded federal investigators, and in particular investigators are unable to explain the reports of more than 20 persons who say they saw an unac- countable light streaking toward Flight 800 before it went down. John Ford is the first UFO investigator to be seriously persecuted by the authorities. Shall we sit idly by while our colleague's life is destroyed? If John Ford is silenced, who is next? Contact the John Ford Defense Committee at web site wwwriwaynet.net/~pic or email elaine26@juno.com The Committee needs funds for John's legal defense and donations of several kinds: a psychiatrist expert witness; profes- sional audiotape analysis; and a Long Island-based legal investigator.

FRAGMENT - Continued from Page 6 opened new doors in the continued search for answers. Fleck had interviewed via tele- phone one Randy Fullbright, a jeweler in St. George, Utah. Fullbright had stated that the original fragment was a piece of scrap from his studio. On September 7,1 visited the James Kallas Jewelry shop in Santa Fe to photograph samples of Fullbright's jewelry on display. For me the fragment mystery was now 99% solved. I have since had three lengthy telephone conversations with Mr. Fullbright, one on September 11, and another on September 14, when he described the metal's mysteri- ous characteristics. He stated they were the result of an ancient Japanese metal working technique known as Mokume Gane, or in English translation, \"wood grain metal.\" My third conversation with Fullbright was on September 17 to thank him for the Mokume Gane scrap samples I'd received from him that day. The convincing evidence to culmi- nate the fragment puzzle was now in hand. On September 19, an early morning meeting with museum officials in Roswell closed the case. The museum's fragment #2 and a sample from Fullbright's studio were determined to be a positive match. The scientific and investigative research employed in this widely reported case, both nationally and internationally, has strength- ened credibility for the Roswell International UFO Museum and Research Center. And there's that curious coincidence about Moriches Bay, which more than a few persons have pointed out. Moriches Bay is where John said the United States brought down an alien craft in 1989, and Moriches Bay is where TWA Flight 800 mysteriously crashed in August.

More details about the event, notably concerning the other witnesses, physical evidence analysis, and spectacular after-effects to at least one participant, have emerged. This article draws upon several in- terviews with Kelly Cahill plus information she has provided at various public lectures. Kelly has now gone very public with her side of the story and has just authored a book titled Encounter (published by Harper/Collins). Firstly though, a recap of the story as we knew it, as it has been some time since my previous article. On the 1st of October 1993, Kelly and her husband Andrew (pseu- donym) were travelling through an outer suburb of Melbourne, the capital city of the state of Victoria, Australia, on their way to visit friends. On passing by an open piece of ground on the side of the road, a feeling of dread passed through her. Memories of an episode from the night of the 7/8th August, 1993 emerged which had been hidden since that time On that earlier date on the way home from a friend's place, near Belgrave, Melbourne, they had encountered a brilliant light in front of their car which took up the width of the road. Both Kelly and Andrew noticed an unusual lighted object to their right at ground level. Andrew halted the ve- hicle, and both got out and crossed the road to look at the UFO. As they did so, Kelly noted another vehicle had stopped 100 me- ters further down the road. As they stood and watched, a group of tall, black figures with red eyes approached them, \"floating\" over the ground. Kelly fell to the ground, felt blinded and nauseous, then apparently became unconscious. Andrew and Kelly, as in so many other abduction events, then ''came to,\" sitting in their car at some later stage. On reaching home they found a period of time had been lost from their lives. That night Kelly found a red, triangular mark beneath her navel which hadn't been there before. There was also a small \"cut\" on her bikini line similar to a laparoscopy mark. She bled from her vagina for 3 1/2 weeks after which she was hospitalized and diagnosed with an infection of her womb. The Phenomena Research Australia group were fortunate to locate the three oc- cupants of the second vehicle who con- sented to be interviewed. Subsequently, though, commercialism entered the scene and later the other party denied the PRA permission to publish their full story. However, some further details of their ac- count have leaked, and surprisingly they spoke on public radio in late 1995/early 1996. New facts: the other party Three people, Bill, a manager, Jane, his wife, and Glenda, a nurse, had been travel- ling in a vehicle in front of Kelly and Andrew on that night. As they reached the encounter site all became nauseous and the driver, unable to retain proper control of the vehicle, crashed into a pole on the side of the road. As they started to pull off the road, two cars went past, one of which is believed to have contained Kelly and Andrew. The three saw the same UFO and beings as Kelly and Andrew, then heard a hum- ming sound, and blacked out. The male wit- ness, in addition, stated, like Kelly, that he had experienced temporary blindness. To again illustrate the apparent time dis- continuity between pre- and post-encounter for the group, Glenda recalled that one mo- ment she had been holding a can of coke, and the next instant it had simply not been there. PRA's research revealed that Bill could not recall anything like an abduction, but both Glenda and Jane, under regression hypnosis, recalled being onboard some kind of object. Did any of this second group have post- encounter marks as Kelly did? At a lecture in Adelaide on the 3rd September 1996, Kelly showed color transparencies of a row"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL of three dots on the inner thighs of one of the other two women and commented that both Jane and Glenda had these lines of marks. She also showed a color trans- parency of a ligature mark around the ankle of one of the women. In addition, both had below-navel trian- gular marks. Kelly stated that under hypno- sis, Jane and Glenda recalled being flat on their backs, restrained in some fashion on a table. Interestingly, during their onboard ex- periences both of these women were unable to talk, but could communicate telepathi- cally! These then are the details currently avail- able on the circumstances surrounding the other party. New facts: the site The location where the multiple witness encounter occurred is an open field along- side the road, in undulating countryside. The object, seen by both parties, is de- scribed as an oval shape, possibly 50m across, upon the sides of which were large, circular, pale orange-colored lights. Underneath this oval were \"beams\" of light, extending downwards, and of a \"pale lumi- nescent blue.\" Jane and Glenda also drew what appeared to be some kind of \"tripod structure\" underneath the object, inside the blue beams. PRA investigators apparently discovered three \"marks\" in the paddock in the location of this tripod structure, some six meters apart. They also conducted a search with a magnetometer and then made a computer map of \"the area. This clearly indicates a semi-circular anomaly where Kelly placed the object. Soil and vegetation samples were also re- ported to have undergone changes, the full details of which have not yet been released. However, Kelly's public lecture alleged that the analysis detected excess amounts of sul- phur; that the three \"marks\" had been pro- duced by a chemical called \"pyrene,\" and that higher than expected amounts of tannic acid were also detected. New details: the after-effects I have, for some time, been researching the after-effects of experiences and the fol- lowing information came from Kelly in a lengthy interview I conducted in Sydney, New South Wales, in January of this year. At the time of her experience she would have been the first to ridicule those who took a \"New Age\" view. However, as you will see, she now knows that these events can occur to anyone. For the first six months after the event Kelly did not have the same dream pattern as prior to the event. There were dreams in which she felt \"someone\" was talking to her, imparting information, almost in the context of lessons. In addition, she had dreams in which she was recording volumes of information. These particular dreams then stopped and the former dream pattern re-emerged. However, recently another type of dream has begun. One she calls an \"elec- tric dream.\" These all involve, or revolve around, en- ergies/forces and seem to have a number of variations: • Ones in which she is being sucked backwards into a force. This force is pure evil. Kelly thinks she is going to die and panics. The force is one which she had pre- viously met at the encounter site. • Ones in which there is a pressure on her chest and she finds it difficult to breath. • The third variety is one where there is a feeling of energy inside her body and a sensation that she is not in control of her own body. Kelly has formed the opinion that the dreams don't allow her to fall into deep sleep. If she feels she is slipping into a deeper phase of sleep then she receives what she can only describe as an \"electric shock\" in the right-hand side of her head. At this location, but on the surface of her head, she had noticed that an indentation had appeared which had not previously been there. For the past 18 months Kelly has had a problem looking into mirrors. She looks at the eyes, but the eyes she sees do not appear to be hers. While viewing she hears the words, \"Look behind,\" looks, but noth- ing unusual is there. Then one day she thought of an alternative meaning to the words and looked behind herself through the mirror. The reversed appearance of things in the mirror brought her attention to the perception that this view was one she had had previously in real life, in her child- hood. This gave her a feeling of awe. Since Kelly has formed the opinion that the dreams don't allow her to fall into deep sleep. If she feels she is slipping into a deeper phase of sleep then she receives what she can only describe as an \"elec- tric shock\"in the right- hand side of her head.

She looks at the eyes, but the eyes she sees do not appear to be hers. November 1996 Number 343 Page 12 that realisation the problem of \"eyes\" has gone away. C hannelling as a process has had a checkered history, but Kelly found she could channel in 1994. She differentiates between two types. The first she describes as channelling from the heart, and the sec- ond as \"dissociation,\" where spiritual infor- mation emerges. Within the latter, Kelly talks of accessing different energies to which she has given discrete names. One day, after the encounter, Kelly sim- ply started automatic writing and contacted \"Concord.\" Concord was its name, and it named several energies such as \"now\" and \"overnow.\" She asked through the auto- matic writing where these energies came from and was told that she had brought them into existence. A few correct pieces of information flowed from \"Concord,\" but Kelly then de- cided to stop the writing. She believes she can still do it, but has chosen not to. The overall impression Kelly has re- ceived from this force is that \"You are being trained in a certain way.\" Being trained for something. Her strongest belief, although she has not been directly told this, is that there will be a shift in consciousness in mankind. It might be cataclysmic, and will involve the whole of the human race. Kelly continues to receive little electric shocks from substances which you would not normally expect to give them, i.e., wood, stones and earth. In response to seeking treatment for a nerve problem in her back, she underwent a magnetic resonance scan at the Alfred hos- pital on 29th December, 1995. For this you are required to remove all metal objects from your body. Starting in the machine and continuing to the date of my January inter- view, Kelly felt a sharp pain in the left-hand side of her head and behind her left eye. Interestingly, she also revealed that for some nine months post-encounter she expe- rienced migraine headaches. THE THIRD PARTY Almost forgotten in the wealth of infor- mation from the second party is that there was a third vehicle which stopped at the site that night. Nothing had been heard of the occupant of this vehicle, who was reported to be a single male. I had been try- ing to locate this person via radio inter- views with Melbourne radio stations but to no avail. At the recent Australian International UFO Symposium held in Brisbane, Queensland, it was revealed that a woman, apparently the wife of the third man, had contacted a national magazine to tell his story. He is reportedly a local lawyer, who recalls the incident involving the other two parties. He reportedly had found unusual marks on his thigh after the event and pho- tographed these. The letter seemingly con- tained details which would be known only to the parties present on that night. The let- ter indicated that the man was ready to come forward and talk to UFO researchers. In summary Despite the lack of in-depth information from the other party, sufficient has emerged to indicate that here is a strong possibility of an independently witnessed abduction, equally as compelling as the \"Linda\" case, and with far more physical evidence.

In a letter accompany- ing the photographs the source claims to have taken the remarkable UFO pictures on the 16th of September. 1996. The photos and a copy of the accompa- nying letter were first aired publicly on TV- 33 in LaGrange. Georgia on 26 September. 1996. On the \"Heston & Steve\" show, hosts Heston Yates and Steve Smoots, along with John C. Thompson and Jimmy Smith, field investigators for the International Society for UFO Research (ISUR). discussed the re- ality of the photos. All were agreed that if they were part of a hoax, it was a most strange and clever one. Mr. Thompson said he was \"most favorably impressed by the photos.\" Two other witnesses have since surfaced who claim to have seen similarly shaped UFOs in May and July in the LaGrange area, which is only 20 miles from Valley, Alabama, where the pictures were allegedly taken. MUFON staff photoanalyst Jeff Sainio has received copies for analysis. The photographer has been promised anonymity if he or she will step forward to further assist investigators. The photographs were accompanied by the following verbatim letter. \"To whom it may concern. \"I am writing this letter with much trepi- dation due to the strange matters which it addresses.

Until I actually saw this 'craft', I had no belief whatsoever in UFOs or the like. Now I must admit a dras- tic change in that belief. \"I had left the house in my truck around 2:30 to repair some of the fence line on my westernmost pasture. I had my 35mm cam- era with me because I occasionally took pictures of deer and the like which often grazed in the adjoining pasture. I took my 8 month old beagle 'Spot' with me. When we arrived at the fence line I got out of my truck and 'Spot' ran out and began running around sniffing the ground etc. I began cut- ting out a piece of rusted fence with my bolt cutter when 'Spot' started to whine and bark like no dog I have ever heard before. I thought he had gotten stung by a hornet or been bitten by a snake so I went to investi- gate. He stood about 200 feet from my po- sition and faced towards the south of the fenceline. I ran toward him until I got about halfway there. That's when I saw what you now see in the photographs. It was a large black object that was hovering over some trees in the horizon. I stood there for a few moments and then remembered my camera. I ran back to the truck, got out the camera and ran to stand next to 'Spot'. I snapped a few pictures and noticed that it was making a high pitched whistling sound. I guess this was what was making 'Spot' howl so. I took a few more pictures as it slowly moved and then hovered some more. At one point it climbed about 4000 feet straight up. It didn't make a sound and it moved as fast as a lightening bolt. I kept taking pictures until I ran out of film. The 'thing' remained in my sight for about an- other five minutes and then it seemed to crumble in upon itself and vanish. Now let me tell you I was as scared as I have ever been. I shook for a long time after it left. There is one other strange thing I think I should report. About 10 minutes after the 'thing' vanished there came three black (or dark green) helicopters which flew low to the ground for a few minutes then left. None of these helicopters had any kind of markings. Now this may not be related, but it just seemed strange. \"Well that's really all I have to say on the subject. You can do with this letter and pic- tures what you will. I just needed to let someone know what I saw.

While initially optimistic, he now finds them \"suspicious,\" noting \"that the Unidentified Object moves considerably with respect to the treeline and fencepost, indicating considerable camera motion, but has a stable height and size with respect to the fencepost, even though the distance from the camera to fencepost changes con- siderably. This is most simply explained if the UO is a small model strung up near the fencepost.\" Says Thompson, \"We will continue our investigation until we are certain that the phototaker will not come out of the closet to prove his photos are real. Reluctantly, with- out the negatives, more photos—he says he took a whole roll!—or the man and exact location of the photo-taking^, we will, even- tually, have to declare them a hoax. \"Personally, I remain cautiously opti- mistic about the photos, unless Jeff's analy- sis shows for certain how the photos were hoaxed. The shape and flight characteristics of the UFO as described in the phototaker's letter are, for the most part, consistent with what other people around LaGrange have said on seeing this same type UFO.\" UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO Newsclipping Service will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounters and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town and foreign newspapers.

Though these things are important to the overall pic- ture, the footage itself deserves an evalua- tion as well. The consensus in ufological circles seems to be that the footage is a hoax, with the expectation that if it is not, then it should be proven real. There are two fa- vored opinions for the hoax hypothesis. One is that what we are seeing in the footage is a human body, the other is that the body was created by movie special effects artists. As any researcher knows the facts in any case being investigated must fit the theory. Both of these theories leave some unanswered questions. Many of the comments made about the footage are simply incorrect. Some of this is because many people have commented only on the footage shown on various television programs, rather than the entire footage it- self. Others have watched the full footage but apparently not examined it thoroughly. Contrary to what is being said, not all the frames in the footage are out of focus. Close and thorough examination of the images re- veals details missed during cursory exami- nation. HUMAN BODY THEORY First we have to ask, \"Who was she?\" Judging by her muscular build, she appears well cared for and healthy, regardless of her deformities. If this was a human, a girl, suf- fering from some genetic disorder or rare disease, someone would have known her, family, doctors, or neighbors. As she was seen by millions of people all over the world, it is a wonder that no one recognized her. At this time, I won't go over all the de- fects and deformities of the body, as they are numerous and obvious. However, no one has yet explained the extreme deformi- ties satisfactorily with any known human diseases or disorders. Do we have an explanation for the eye coverings? If they were a protective cover- ing to keep the eyes moist, as speculated, why would the doctors remove them during the procedure? Also, why would they pre- serve these coverings? Can we explain the obscure, transparent article removed from the chest area? We find more questions in the opened body. The internal organs are not human. The brain is not human. The reflected skin reveals no subcutaneous fat layer. While some diseases will diminish body fat con- siderably, the reflected skin shows no fat whatsoever. Also missing from this body are veins, arteries, mammilla, and a navel. How do we explain the injuries? The right leg shows extensive damage. The right hand is partially severed, though not discon- nected from the arm as has been claimed, and appears badly burned. How would a girl suffering from a rare disease get hurt this badly and no one know about it? It is important to note here that there is more footage showing another autopsy. While not released to the public, several people have seen and described this other autopsy footage. The body in that one has the same deformities and defects but with- out the injuries. The same body could not be in both films, since dissection occurs on both bodies. Do we have twins with the same disease or defects? That would be even more of a wonder in that they never made it into medical textbooks, or that someone didn't know of them. The possibility of an altered human corpse has also been mentioned, however, it would require so much altering to make a human corpse look like what we see here that it would no longer be human. Again, two corpses with the same alterations would be needed to do this. Among the alterations, the internal organs would have to be re- placed, and the skin replaced. During the re- flection of the scalp, we clearly see the \"peeling\" of the skin from the skull. The film is rolling during this, so there isn't time to rig it as they go along. This sequence, not shown in most TV broadcasts, is missed by most people. Apart from the basic form being hu- manoid, there is nothing about this body MUFON mem- ber Carlson, a Computer Technician and Graphics and Imaging Specialist, has spent over a year analyzing the Ray Santilli film, frame by frame. Her research has taken her into human autopsy rooms and put her in contact with several of the people in- volved with the alleged alien autopsy film, includ- ing Santilli himself.

SPECIAL EFFECTS CREATION This theory would answer most of the questions and problems brought up by the human body theory, though it raises a few questions of its own as well. These days, special effects artists can cre- ate practically anything, but this footage be- ing created by some amateurs as a practical joke is not particularly likely. It required considerable time, work and money to pro- duce the autopsy film. We must ask, \"Who did this?\" and look at what it would take to create what we see in the footage. As a spe- cial effects production, it's carefully scripted and planned. There are too many details for it to have been accidental or thrown together in a hurry. For instance, the props in the footage are correct for the period the footage suppos- edly depicts. The creators researched and obtained these. It was first thought that the telephone was the wrong year, but later it was later proven to be correct for the time. Even the electrical outlets are consistent. It is not unusual for anachronisms or props to be wrong even in high budget Hollywood films, so we expected to find some in this footage. After exhaustive examination, there are none. The clock is a particularly important prop. The entire autopsy footage is scripted so that the timing was perfect. That means that if they had to stop the clock for any rea- son, such as touch-ups or adding body parts, they had to carefully set it back to the cor- rect time for the procedures depicted. Interestingly, the electrical cord on the clock has a kink. That kink remains consistent in the footage, from beginning to end. This means that if they moved the clock, they carefully put that cord back exactly the same way it was every time. Other options may be a wall switch controlling the outlet, or a remote control device of some kind to stop and start the clock at precisely the right times. Perhaps this kind of detail is second nature to people who work in special ef- fects. In any case, the accurate timing is evi- dent, and shows careful attention, to details. Due to statements made that the autopsy procedures performed in this footage were not standard, I attended several autopsies as part of my research. No two were exactly the same. However, the general, overall pro- cedures in the footage are those used in au- topsies. Therefore, the producers of this footage did research this area. The high cut on the neck, noted as non-standard, how- ever, is used if removal of the skin on the face is anticipated. We don't see this proce- dure in the footage, as it ends while the doc- tor is still working on the head, but since it is an \"alien autopsy,\" presumably they would want to skin the face and examine the underlying structures. Good thinking by the special effects creators! O ne puzzling detail is one of the props. The human brain is a gel-like substance and after removal during an autopsy it's sus- pended in ajar of liquid to \"fix\" it. The brain in this body is a solid organ, and so doesn't need such suspension. Yet, some- time during the reflection of the scalp the type of jar used for this is placed on the table, with the liquid in it. This shows re- markable insight on the part of the effects people, since they would have known the brain was a solid organ and they would not need that jar. However, they must have known that some of us were going to look for it. Had it been part of a \"standard au- topsy props\" kit one would expect it to be there from the beginning of the procedure, like the flask, the Bunsen burner and other items on that table are. While there are many details missed about the body itself, the one fact that may be the most important is that many people believe it to be a real body. This, it seems to me, would be the highest compliment that could be paid to anyone in the special ef- fects field, implying that the creators were highly talented. However, as a special ef- fects production it's intentionally made to depict an alien autopsy. So why didn't the creators make it look like the common aliens, the small, thin, frail, grey-skinned creatures that have become so popular in the past decade? A detail, probably not noticed by many, is the jointed fingers on at least one hand. The hand gets caught on the doctor's suit and the fingers curl up. The hand catching may have been an accident but the finger bending was not. Also, the hands show creases and lines in the palms, much as our hands have, a wasted detail as most people miss it due to the intentional out of focus camera work. This camera work is planned and scripted and has to be considered very well done."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Moreover, the autopsy room is not an open set as has been claimed. The four walls do appear in the footage. However, one has to look for them as they are not ob- vious. Of course, this doesn't mean that it isn't a set, only that it is a more complex set than what most people think. The producers hired the actors or played the various roles we see in the footage themselves and pro- vided the costumes they wear. Another, puz- zling detail: in one short sequence there is an extra person in the room wearing the same costume. At least five people were in- volved in the making of this film and so far, none is talking. W e don't really know that the autopsy only took two hours, because the clock is a twelve-hour clock; it may have taken fourteen hours or twenty-six hours. Actually, what we are looking at is most likely about two hours' worth of proce- dures. However, human autopsies are done in about half an hour, and sometimes less. The viscera and necessary tissue are re- moved, the body is closed up and released. The in-depth examination takes place later. The person who wrote the script for this footage realized this and added extra time, since it supposedly is an \"alien autopsy.\" The doctor is still working on the body when the film ends, so it could have taken longer. Also, if they had done a very lengthy ex- amination, it would surely be evidence that this was a hoax. Consider that if the military was responsible for this autopsy, the scien- tific study of this thing would not necessar- ily be a priority. They were in the business of defense and the first thing they would want to know is how to defend against them. There would be more interest in how to kill it than in what made it tick. The sci- entific analysis could come later. Again, the scriptwriter was paying attention to detail. Not as much can be said about the debris footage included in this production, mainly because there isn't much of it. Still, the de- bris would had to have been designed and created especially for this footage, as these aren't scraps that one can find lying around in any junk yard. Comparing the approxi- mate size and shape of the hand prints on the panels to the hands on the body, they ap- pear to be consistent. In the debris part of the footage there was an actual tent set up outdoors or a set that included wind. The sides of the tent billow, as though there was a breeze outside it. Another wasted effect, as very few people notice it. The special effects theory is cer- tainly a possible explanation for what we see in this footage. But it's put together with considerable care and attention and is not a simple prank. The producers went to great lengths to try to convince someone that this was a real event. They went above and be- yond what is needed for a simple money- making scheme. CONCLUSIONS? With these new details pointed out, can we now decide which theory best fits what we are looking at in this footage: Is it a hu- man body, a special effects creation, or something else?

I have often stated to audiences that I have a strong feeling that contacts with ex- traterrestrial beings have been occurring for a very long time — probably for centuries. But I do not like to make statements without support from data ... so I went looking ... and I found more than I had ever expected in terms of \"suspicious proof — circum- stantial and strangely familiar to say the least. Of course we can only read these ac- counts and wonder. We cannot interview witnesses nor perform any kind of scientific analyses. Nevertheless, these worldwide ac- counts are highly suggestive of some kind of similar intrusion into the lives of sane in- dividuals. Just consider how many countries have legends of \"little people\" — ie. fairies, pixies, gnomes, leprechauns, goblins, sprites, etc. The term \"alien\" would not have been present in those times; some other terminology had to be employed. Carl Sagan would argue that \"aliens\" are just a continuation and modernization of the same folklore themes. However. I would like to propose that people were describing a simi- lar experience through the centuries and calling it simply by different names accord- ing to the nature and belief-system of their culture. According to folklore, fairies were ac- cused of using humans to improve their ge- netic stock. They were frequently suspected of stealing human children and leaving in their place sickly fairy babies, known as changelings. They were often seen floating in balls of light. Mortals who fell under their spell returned weeks later, thinking that they had only been gone for minutes. Fairies traditionally can cause paralysis by the merest touch. The ordinary passage of time is slowed. Fairies can materialize and vanish in the wink of an eye and often pass whole through physical objects. In 1645 a Cornish teenager, Anne Jeffries, describes the following incident. Anne was knitting in a little arbour just out- side the garden gate when she heard a rustling among the branches as if someone was peeping at her. Anne was frightened and heard the gate open and shut gently, and six little men appeared. They were all dressed in green with the brightest of eyes. One put his hand over her eyes. She felt a sharp prickling sensation and everything went dark. Then she was lifted up into the air and carried she knew not where, until she felt herself set down. She was sur- rounded and courted by her six friends. The fairy who first blinded her put his hands over her eyes again. She was whirled up into the air with a great humming, and at length regained her sight to find herself ly- ing on the floor of the arbour surrounded by anxious friends. She was ill after it for some time, but when she recovered, she declared that she had been carried away by fairies, and in proof of this she showed strange powers of clairvoyance and healing by touch (Dictionary of Fairies by Katharine Briggs). G oing back in time to around 300 A.D. we find an interesting encounter that St. Antony had with a \"disc in the desert\" and strange entities of the air — as told in a bi- ography by St. Athanasius, his contempo- rary. Here is a translation from the Greek text by Dom J.B.

Antony stood and looked at the disc and confuted the demon in it, saying, 'Whence a disc in the desert? This is not a trodden road, and there is no track of any faring this way. And it could not have fallen unnoticed, being of huge size. And even if it had been lost, the loser would certainly have found it had he turned back to look because this place is a desert... It disappeared like smoke before the face of the fire.\" Later, he describes: \"Thereupon in the night they made such a crashing sound that it seemed the whole place was shaken by an earthquake ... the demons rushed in through the four walls of the building in the guise of beasts ... Great is the number of them in the air around us, and they are not far from us. But there is much difference in them. It would be long to speak of their nature and differences ... the only pressing and neces- sary thing now is to know their treacheries ... They have deceived the Greeks with their apparitions... They pretend to prophesy and to foretell things to come ... If they pretend to prophesy, let no one heed. It is not from kindness to their hearers that they do this, but in order to induce these to trust them ...\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The book of Enoch, which was not cho- sen for some reason to be included within the texts of the Bible, has many interesting passages. In the following chapter Enoch describes what could be an abduction aboard a circular \"house\" made of shining crystal and with blazing \"portals\": \"Behold, the clouds invited me and a mist surrounded me, and the course of the stars and the lightnings sped and hastened me, and the winds in the vision caused me to fly and lifted me upward, and bore me into heaven. And I went in till I drew nigh to a wall which is built of crystals and sur- rounded by tongues of fire, and it began to frighten me. And I went into the tongues of fire and drew nigh to a large house which was built of crystals, and the walls of the house were like a tesselated floor made of crystals, and its groundwork was of crystal. Its ceiling was like the path of the stars and the lightnings, and between them were fiery cherubim, and their heaven was as clear as water. A flaming fire surrounded the walls, and its portals blazed with fire. And I en- tered into that house, and it was hot as fire and cold as ice: there were no delights of life therein ... Its appearance was as crystal, and the wheels thereof as the shining sun, and there was the vision of cherubim...(1 Enoch 14: 8-25) Enoch's grandson, Lamech, tells of a dis- turbing birth much later (Chapter 105: 1- 13): \"I have begotten a son, a changed son. He is not human; but, resembling the off- spring of the angels of heaven, is of a differ- ent nature from ours, being altogether un- like to us. His eyes are bright as the rays of the sun; his countenance glorious, and he looks not as if he belonged to me, but to the angels.\" And Lamech was afraid. The Vedic humanoids of ancient India were alleged to have powers called siddhis, which included the skills of telepathy, levi- tation, controlling people's thoughts from a distance, moving through solid objects, in- visibility, and either assuming the forms of animals or generating illusions of such. Their aircraft or \"virmana\" were round, dome-shaped, or cigar-shaped — \"and ap- peared just like the full moon rising in the evening, illuminating in all directions (Alien Identities, by Richard Thompson).\" There are numerous other examples which I have collected and am presenting now in a new two-hour slide show. We should consider the valuable records and legends of our ancestors who may have been trying to comprehend the same phe- nomenon — whatever it is — in their own words of their own times.

Curious and a little concerned, he stopped the car at an intersection and aimed his spotlight upward as the formation moved slowly above him and crossed the road. The aerial object's surface was flat black and shaped much like a boomerang, but one wing was twice as long as the other. The deputy counted five soft blue lights on the underside and five white lights along the trailing edge. He resumed driving, and the object again paced his car, slowing and accelerating to match his varying speeds. Again turning on the spotlight, the deputy was startled by the object's sudden, incredibly fast departure West by Southwest. Later, the deputy found others who had seen an undefined array of lights for about ten seconds. Still another group of four witnesses saw the same shape as the deputy, but claimed they had counted six lights. The group was 13 miles South by Southwest of the location where the deputy had originally stopped to view the object. They heard a faint droning sound coming from the vehicle as it headed West, over the Gulf of Mexico. • Indianapolis Driving northward on a major route in the city suburbs, a man no- ticed an unusual and large white object above and to his left. First headed Northeast on a trajectory that would have it crossing the road behind the witness, the object turned toward him. The man slowed his car and opened his window for a better view as the craft moved almost directly over him. It was V-shaped, with a long side extending downward, and the whole shape was glow- ing. Its soundless, 30 or more miles-per- hour movement was open-end first, the apex trailing the unevenly-long legs. After he had driven out from under the vehicle, the witness viewed it in his rear view mirror. The object was now going South, and a bright light shone at its front. (There being an airport nearby and a bright light on the front of the object made this report suspect, the object possibly being an 1FO. Much investigation time was spent to assess the case's viability, without reach- ing a firm conclusion. The similarity to Report Log 931102E led to including this case in the database.) • Virginia Beach Two police officers were parked in a restaurant lot and dis- cussing a robbery attempt earlier that day. One noticed an odd set of lights approach- ing them, and called to the other, who first thought a practical joke was in progress. When he realized his friend was not joking, he grabbed his binoculars, found them bro- ken, and spent time trying to reassemble the optics. The object was huge and moving slowly and directly toward them at an altitude of about 2,000 feet. Both witnesses described a glowing white diamond shape, half the size of a football field, with a soft but bright white light projected in the direction of movement. Two strings of dim red lights were projected from and to the front of the diamond, the combination like an inverted check mark with a diamond at the apex. A string of six lights that angled downward could have been 1,000-feet long. The other, upward string contained three lights and was about half that long, or 500-feet. Movement was soundless, at a speed of about 25 miles-per-hour, with the apex at the rear. Shortly, the object was hidden by the restaurant building. The two police officers tried to give chase, but they could not locate it. They began hearing voices over their LoJack digital system, which took them by surprise. (The manufacturer's representative later said others had made similar com- plaints, and he suspected the FBI or Secret • Service was involved.) Investigators confirmed no radar echo was observed at two airports due to the ob- ject, and there were no other reports of someone seeing the craft. No blimps were in the area.

Receiving more than one-thousand entries, the selection committee has been overwhelmed by the work in finding a motto that best exemplifies the goals and objective of MUFON. Obviously, the motto or theme of the TV program \"X-files\" cannot be accepted. The revelation of MUFON's motto and the winning en- try will be announced in the Journal in due time.

The symposium theme is \"The Fiftieth Anniversary of Ufology.\" Some of the speakers will reflect upon events in 1947 to recognize the modern era of ufology. David E. Toth, Ph.D. (Holt, MI) will be the symposium coordinator. Speakers presently scheduled are Cynthia Hinds, Dan Wright, Jan Aldrich, Stanton T. Friedman, and Vincente-Juan Ballester Olmos. SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS COVER DESIGN CONTEST The success of the 1996 Symposium Proceedings cover design contest has prompted MUFON to make this an annual competition. Fran Geremia. wife of New Hampshire State Director, Peter Geremia, was the 1996 winner. The cover design should reflect the symposium theme \"The Fiftieth Anniversary of Ufology\" and in- clude, in addition to the theme, the statements \"MU- FON 1997 INTERNATIONAL UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS,\" the location GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN, and the symposium dates \"July 11-13.\" The contest submissions must be \"camera ready\" and not simply attractive designs, symbols or artwork.

CROP CIRCLES REPORT In the summer of 1992, Project Argus investigated one of the most remarkable mysteries of the century, the sudden and baffling appearance of hundreds of of huge, mag- nificent shapes — dubbed \"crop circles\" — in the fields of England each summer. Made of grain flattened me- thodically to the ground in intricate patterns, they were a form of landscape art which quickly attracted world- wide attention. But the \"artist\" was unknown. Where did they come from? What agent or force routinely gen- erated them overnight? Could they be products of some- thing other than human activity? It seems appropriate to seek to answer such questions with the instruments and methods of science. Everyone interested in the study of the crop circle phenomenon should have a copy of the Report on the Results of Project Argus: An Instrumented Study of the Physical Materials of Crop Circles, edited by Michael Chorost, in 1993. Since MUFON provided $2.500 to fi- nancially support this ambitious team project, we have a supply of the 115-page books for sale. A copy may be purchased for $15, plus $2.00 for postage and handling in U.S. funds, from MUFON in Seguin, TX. (No credit cards accepted.) This is the first time that MUFON has offered this book for sale. UFO-RELATED HUMAN PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS John F. Schuessler, Deputy Director, Administration for MUFON and head of MUFON's Medical Committee recently published a 105-page book, 8 1/2 x 11 soft cover, titled A Catalog of UFO-Related Human Physiological Effects. Nearly four-hundred case listings have been accumulated worldwide, starting in 1873 and continuing through 1994 of people that have suffered physical effects in the proximity of a UFO. The pur- pose of the catalog is threefold: (1) It provides a chrono- logical listing of UFO events involving physiological effects on humans; (2) It provides source information for other researchers desiring to do work in this important field, and (3) It is the first step in systematizing the med- ical injury data base.
