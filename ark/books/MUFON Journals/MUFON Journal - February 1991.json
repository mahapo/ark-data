I was 16 years old when this incident occurred not far from my hometown. It was apparent after the event occur- red, that something of interest to the military had caused them to swiftly react, and the Air Force explanation of a meteor as the cause of the sighting did not correspond to information that had spread through the local areas, weeks later after the event. But the local media quickly dropped the story, and didn't pursue the many witnesses who had been involved with activities around the village that night, some of whom would surface during the next 25 years to reveal their pieces to the puzzle as to what really occur- red, and what was really found in the woods that night. During the week after the incident, John Murphy (now de- ceased), the News Director of WHJB radio in Greensburg, along with his staff, put together a radio documentary on the Kecksburg UFO incident called \"Object in the Woods.\" The program was aired, but in a censored version. Some local residents who would be interviewed later remembered an uneasiness around the village after the event, and rumors of government threats and payoffs still persist today. Since the event, I have been keeping records on the case, but during the last 10 years, multiple independent wit- nesses have been surfacing who now begin to show the pattern of a major military operation that involved the quick response recovery of an Uniden- tified Flying Object. Testimony from people directly in- volved at the site that night, as well as other informants, suggests that members of the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and NASA all had a part in the recovery and/or examination of the ob- ject in question. While the Kecksburg Incident has been the talk of the local area for many years, more recently the case became nationally exposed when NBC's \"Unsolved Mysteries\" featured the case as their Season Premiere on September 19, 1990. Prior to the airing of the show, myself and other PASU members had been busy following up on many new informants on the case. After the show aired, over 100 responses relevant to the case came our way. Some of the information came from anonymous sources, and therefore isn't considered as reliable data. However, other key informants did sur- face whose information helped fill gaps from the statements we had from other observers. W e have now interviewed many dozens of people who were involved in the Kecksburg in- cident. These involve both civilian and former military personnel. Those inter- viewed include witnesses to the slow moving object heading into Kecksburg, (four) independent observers who saw the object on the ground prior to the arrival of the military (we also know of a deceased party who told his wife that he saw the metallic object in the woods), firemen who drove military of- ficers through the fields that led to the impact site, firemen who witnessed the military usage of the Kecksburg Firehall as a temporary command post, infor- mants who saw the military operation taking place in various sections of the village, and others who have knowledge as to where the object was transported to, and what was done with it. During the second half of 1990, in- formation began to surface from new witnesses indicating that the object's maneuverability was quite interesting. Our data now suggests that the object was moving at a slow rate of speed, made several turns, was apparently try- ing to gain altitude over the ridge, and seemingly hovered before making a \"slow\" descent into the wooded area. More recently uncovered information suggests other interesting anomalies associated with the descending object, but much more research must be done to clarify these details. The more we know of the object in question, the more we have to wonder what indeed was this device? Could it have been an actual Extraterrestrial craft that apparently had problems with its propulsion system, or was this a highly secretive mission to recover a manmade probe (from an Earthly na- tion) that was highly sophisticated for what many scientists tell us that man was capable of constructing in 1965? B y the time this report is pub- lished, the 25th Anniversary of the Kecksburg case will have passed, and important details relative to this event will have been released though the local news media. This in- formation suggests that the government has the object in their hands, and that it was stated to have been an Alien Spacecraft. Since our informants can't be identified per their request, we have utilized a local news reporter who has spent some time on this case, to act as a mediator. This media source will abide by the same rules of confidentiali- ty as myself and the PASU team to pro- tect the identity of witnesses. She will however, be able to interview them directly, and be able to see and verify our documentation of testimonies. I have been swamped with requests from UFO researchers and publications for update information on the case. In the past I have written some articles on the incident. At this time we are spend- ing much time and effort tracking down other leads on the case, and interview- ing more witnesses, and documenting MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ARMY ROPES OFF AREA— 'Unidentified Flying Object' An \"unidentified flying object\"—possibly the same one reported seen streaking across seven northeastern states and Canada late Thursday afternoon — ap- parently fell to the earth in a secluded wooded area near Kecksburg in West- moreland County. The area where the object landed was immediately sealed oft on the order of U.S. Army .and State Police officials, re- portedly in anticipation of a \"close inspection\" of whatever i)i ay have fallen. A spokesman for a team of radar experts from the Army's 662 radar squadron in Pitts- burgh said, \"We don't know what we have yet.' Tribune-Review Staff Writer Robert Gatty reported from the scene that \"no one is being allowed near the object.\" State Police officials there, he said, ordered the area roped off to await the expected arrival of both U.S. Army engineers and, possibly, civilian scientists. The Army enugineers, he said, were scheduled to arrive late Thursday night or early Friday morning. Scientists were expect- ed to be brought in some time today. Unable to talk to anyone who had actually seen the object Gatly reported that the con- sistent explanation of the se- curity measures is that the ob- ject—whatever it is—may be contaminated with radioactivity. Shape Mystery The \"unidentified flying ob- ject\" (UFO) was sighted falling to the earth by Mrs. Arnold Kalp of Acme RD 1 and her two children. Mrs. Kalp, Gatty re- ported, was not available to talk Thursday night, apparently be- cause of the throng of newsmen and spectators, who began ar- riving in the Kecksburg area shortly after word of the sight- ing was reported. Although no one lias indi- cated the size or shape of the object, Gatty said he talked to one farmer in the area—Dale Howard, who lives about a mile from the scene of the reported landing. Howard reported \"feel- ing a vibration\" and \"a thump\" about the time the object re- portedly fell. The near-exact locaMon of the object, Gatly determine;!, is 500 feet off Legislative Route 64214 in Mt. Pleasant Township, about one-half mile east of Kecksburg.

It will take many months of research to gather just the data that we are aware of at this time. Rather than to give segments of the case, we will in the future publish up- date reports on our findings. While our past published information on the case is generally accurate, some new details, and further interviews with witnesses have clarified some points, and some small details will be corrected in future reports. While the Kecksburg case is a highly interesting topic of conversation around Westmoreland County, a few Kecksburg residents were highly upset that the UFO incident was going to make na- tional TV. This small group in fact sent a petition to NBC to try to block the airing of the program. The big ques- tion is why this group of people were so emotionally driven to try to cause doubt as to whether or not the incident occurred. The media picked up on this part of the story as well, and suggested that much of the town was putting down the story. This is indeed not the case. The Kecksburg Fire Department was given the model of the UFO built for the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" show. They have made a permanent monument of the object on the roof of the original truck station after unanimous vote of the membership. On December 9, 1990, a 25th Anniversary UFO Dance was held to commemorate the event. The Fire Department sold tee shirts, caps and sweat shirts to get the word out to the public. The Kecksburg Case is a major event, and a part of UFO history. If you have any information on the case please contact us by writing to PASU, 6 Oakhill Ave., Greensburg.

Many of the just-curious spectators, he said, left the scene when in- formed by police that they could not get near the object. Newsmen Wait Newsmen, however. were holding tight, for the most part, to await some official word from either the U.S. Army or the State Police officials in charge. The obvious excitment arous- ed by the apparent landing stems, in part, from dozens of \"sightings\" all over parts of the northeastern part of the United States and Canada. Pentagon sources in Wash- lion, D.C., according to a United Press International dis- patch, indicated the flash could have been a meteor. Earlier reports, the UPI dis- patch said, indicated the flash could have been a high altitude test rocket fired over Lake Erie. But National Guard and Air Force officials told UPI report- ers that no rockets had been fired. The UPI dispatch went on: \"Eric Johnson, a reporter for an Erie, Pa., television station, said, \"It flashed across the lake, north northwest of the Erie airport leaving a kind of cloud of smoke behind it.\" \"Raymond Wallings, a private airplane pilot from Painesville, Ohio, said he was flying over the lake when he saw the \"fireball\" and kept his eye on it until it plummeted into the lake. \"U.S. Coast Guara officials reported a flying object explod- ed over the Detroit - Windsor area.

BASES S3.ntUS, Tribune-Review, Greensburg, Pennsylvania Twenty-five years ago today, a UFO reportedly landed in a wooded area near Kecksburg in Mt. Pleasant Township. Now, for the first time, witnesses say they saw the object at two separate high- security Air Force bases in Ohio just days afterward. The witnesses, who are requesting anonymity, say they were instructed by the military not to discuss what they saw. Just before sundown on December 9, 1965, a bright, orange fireball streak- ed across the sky over Michigan, the tip of Ontario and western Lake Erie. The object continued its descent and was spotted over Westmoreland Coun- ty skies. Witnesses said it glided to earth at a low rate of speed in a wood- ed area near Kecksburg. According to some accounts, dozens of military personnel converged on the area and ordered spectators away. Witnesses said a flatbed truck was driven to the landing site and left sometime later with a tarpaulin-covered object on the back. The official report from the United States Air Force is that a meteor passed over the area and was not seen again. State Police from Greensburg said they searched the area that night and the following day and found nothing. Two witnesses including James Romansky of Derry, came forward several weeks ago and said they saw the object on the ground that night in Kecksburg. S tan Gordon, who heads the Greensburg-based Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained, said the witnesses - in separate interviews - described it as a bronze-colored, acorn-shaped object about 12 feet long and 10 feet in diameter. Each said it was wrapped with a band of unintelligible markings. Despite the men's accounts, some in Kecksburg insist the reports are nothing more than fabricated nonsense. They \"President Kennedy came to the base while I was at Lockborne and there wasn't as much security as I saw that morning.\" say an object might have passed through the sky that day, but it never fell anywhere near Kecksburg. The Kecksburg UFO incident gained national attention in September on NBC's \"Unsolved Mysteries.\" Disbelievers, many of whom own land in the area where the object reported- ly landed, tried unsuccessfully to have the program canceled. Since the broadcast, more than 100 people telephoned \"Unsolved Myster- ies\" to offer additional information. Among them is a Westmoreland County man who was a member of the U.S. Air Force stationed at Lockborne Air Base near Columbus, Ohio, in December 1965. Robert Adams (not his real name) said the facility was placed on \"red alert\" during the early-morning hours of December 10, 1965. A member of the air police, Adams said his unit was immediately dis- patched to a hangar where they as- sumed guard positions. He said a flat- bed truck with a tarpaulin-covered ob- ject on the back entered the hangar and superior officers ordered the police to shoot to kill anyone who attempted to enter without top-security clearance. Adams said the truck had entered the base through the rear gate, which he said was highly unusual since the gate is located on an extremely remote area of the compound. He said the truck passed a few feet in front of him and the object on the back appeared to be twice the size of a Volkswagen. Adams said he was relieved of guard duty at 6 or 7 a.m. and learned later the truck, still carrying the object, left the base at 7:30 a.m. en route to Wright Patterson Air Force base, 100 miles west near Dayton. He said he was discharged from the Air Force a year later and returned to Westmoreland County where he learned of the Kecksburg case. \"Because of the timing of the inci- dent - the day after the Kecksburg crash - and because of the top-secret nature of the situation, I have no doubt in my mind the object taken inside the hangar that morning at Lockborne was the same object that came down in Kecksburg,\" Adams said. \"President Kennedy came to the base while I was at Lockborne and there wasn't as much security as I saw that morning.\" A nother witness, Ohio truck driver John Cummings (not his real name), said he actually saw the object inside a building at Wright Patterson on December 12, 1965, just three days after the alleged landing. Cummings, who made deliveries for a Dayton-area building-supply com- pany, said a high ranking military of- ficer arrived at the firm on December 11, 1965, and ordered a special radiation-moisture-resistant brick for construction of a protective room inside a building at Wright Patterson. Cummings said he and a cousin delivered 6,500 bricks to Wright Pat- terson the next day after being in- structed by their boss not to discuss anything they might observe at the compound. \"We were unloading the bricks onto pallets, and me and my cousin decided to sneak inside to see what all the secrecy was about,\" Cummings said. \"Guards immediately ordered us out... but not before we saw it.\" Cummings said he saw a dark bronze, bell-shaped object about 14 feet MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"wide at the base and about 12 feet high. He said scaffolding surrounded the object, which was covered on three sides with parachute-like material that hung from the ceiling. According to Cummings, 10 to 15 men with white, protective suits, wearing rubber boots, rubber gloves and gas masks were at- tempting to open the object. \"They took us outside and told us to forget what we had seen,\" Cummings said. \"We were told that in 20 years, the object would be common know- ledge.\" Cummings said that a few days later he learned that other truck drivers had seen a flatbed military truck with a tarpaulin-covered object on the back traveling from the Pittsburgh area west on Route 40 toward Wheeling, West Virginia, and then on to Columbus and Dayton. He said that information along with his own experience convinces him that the object he saw at Wright Patterson was the same as that which allegedly fell in Kecksburg. Cummings had been interviewed ex- tensively by Len Stringfield, a national- ly known UFO investigator and author of Situation Red: The UFO Siege, published by Doubleday. \"I've talked with (Cummings) numerous times and I have every reason to believe he's telling the truth,\" Stringfield said. \"He had no previous interest in UFOs and doesn't want any publicity about his experience.\" Stringfield said Kecksburg holds as much importance as the infamous Roswell, New Mexico, UFO retrieval case. Many researchers believe the U.S. government retrieved bodies of alien beings after one and possibly two craft fell in the desert near Roswell in 1947. \"With the amount of information Stan Gordon has gathered on Kecksburg, I would place it just behind Roswell as the most significant UFO retrieval case in history,\" Stringfield said. Gordon, who has gathered govern- ment documents and compiled thousands of pages of research in the Kecksburg case, said new information is surfacing almost daily. \"We have several new witnesses who have come forward since the 'Unsolved KECKSBURG OBJECT? This is an artist's rendering of the object allegedly seen by an Ohio truck driver at Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton on Dec. 12, 1965. \"They took us outside and told us to forget what we had seen. We were told that in 20 years, the object would be common knowledge.\" Mysteries' segment aired in September,\" Gordon said. \"Many of them are Kecksburg residents who were in the area that night.\" Gordon continues to gather research and asks that anyone with information contact him by writing: The Penn- sylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained, 6 Oakhill Ave., Greensburg, PA, 15601. Gordon said there can be no doubt an object landed 25 years ago today in Kecksburg. \"It made turns, it hovered, it definite- ly was not a meteor,\" Gordon said. \"Was it an alien spacecraft or a highly- advanced aircraft from the United States or a foreign country? We can't be sure. The one thing we do know is that the government continues to draw a cloak of secrecy around the entire in- cident. What could they be hiding?\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"GULF BREEZE UPDATE Dan Wright, Deputy Director, Investigations In the first week of December, Inter- national Director Walt Andrus sent copies of over a dozen of the Walters' UFO photos to an independent optical expert for computerized analysis and other precise measurements. These in- volve all the major claimed events by the Walters family. Walt had previously taken 35 mm close-ups of the original polaroids, and the forwarded prints were made from those negatives. Therefore, the quality of each is presumably close to the original polaroid print. The recipient of these photos is a decades-long expert in optics and ap- plied sciences with a background in physics. He is self-employed as a photography consultant and was highly recommended. Among his earlier achievements, he analyzed photographs for the National Geographic. The in- dividual's name is being withheld so as to avoid any influence or interruption. His son, also a photo expert, is assisting. A report is not expected for at least several months and may entail prior publication in a refereed scientific jour- nal. It should be noted that, due to MUFON's limited funds as well as his interest in the case, the gentleman agreed to waive his normal - substan- tial - fee for the computerized examina- tion of the photos. This case has drawn many specula- tions, caused hard feelings among earlier colleagues, and perplexed the general membership. The subplots and com- plexity are worthy of a Frank Herbert trilogy. However, the central (and only REAL) question relates to the photos themselves. With credit to Walt Andrus, we will in time have an absolutely in- dependent expert analysis. In the in- terim, I wish to clarify the following: 1) Prior to agreeing to send the Walters' photos for analysis, neither Walt Andrus nor anyone else within MUFON management had any acquaintance with the person. The decision to use his talents and facilities was made solely on the accolades he has received. 2) The gentleman had no previous substantial interest in the UFO subject. 3) Neither Walt nor I will be com- municating with him as he proceeds ex- cept possibly to provide additional materials, should he so request, or to respond to any questions which may arise on his part. Walt has instructed the few others who know his identity and location not to communicate same to anyone in any manner. 4) The gentleman has indicated that his conclusions will be based solely on the physical characteristics inherent in the photographs and not on any cir- cumstantial evidence, either pertaining to the Walters' account or any other UFO account in the Pensacola area. If his conclusions are negative, before publishing the results Walt will presumably seek the reaction of Bruce Maccabee, himself a laser and optical physicist who has spent hundreds of hours pouring over the photos. After three years and so much time expended by so many people, after all, we want to be sure beyond a reasonable doubt. The Model Concerning the UFO model found in the attic/garage of the former Walters' home, there is now sufficient documen- tation to conclude it was created some- time after September 1989, that is, well after all of the Walters' claims had con- cluded on May 1, 1988. Two exhibits were used in reaching this conclusion: (1) a carefully drawn recreation by the Menzers, current owners of the former Walters' home, of the blueprint strip used as the midpor- tion of the saucer model, and (2) the September 1989 design on graph paper by Ed Walters of a home originally con- tracted by (but never built for) Mr. and Mrs. Lynn Thomas, the details of which were confirmed by the Thomases in a telephone conversation initiated by your Deputy. As drawn by Mrs. Menzer, the ap- proximate two-inch strip contains the incomplete notation \"...vg A. 1740,\" below which is the incomplete notation \"...B 2393.\" The September 1989 design prepared for and sent to the Thomases contains the notations \"1740 LA\" and \"2393.\" As confirmed by the Thomases, the living area (i.e. \"(L)vg A.\" and later expressed as \"LA\") was to be 1740 square feet. The \"(SLA)B 2393\" shown on the blueprint likewise coincides with the simply expressed \"2393\" on the graph paper design in their possession. Moreover, the blueprint shows what appears to be a partial street address on Jamestown Drive. The Thomases confirmed that the house which would have been built for them in late 1989 was to be at the corner of Jamestown Drive and Shoreline Avenue. As a supporting point, I personally calculated the square footage of the liv- ing area from the Thomases' graph design, which totals 1740 square feet. In that Ed Walters builds only custom- designed homes, it is extremely unlikely that he would have built two homes less than three years apart which had a Jamestown Drive location and those precise dimensions. No one has ques- tioned the veracity of either the Thomases or the Menzers regarding their willing testimony. The living-area and concrete slab dimensions confirmed by the Thomases and recalculated by myself are telling evidence. The location of the prospec- tive home on the corner of Jamestown and Shoreline further supports Ed Walters' claim that the Thomas graph paper design and the blueprint strip on the model are of the same home — both drawn in September 1989 and therefore well after the Walters' experiences had concluded.

In a country as violent as ours we have become accustomed to murder, mayhem, plots and mysteries. Since these disturbing cultural artifacts can- not be made to go away, entrepreneurs have realized that they can be exploited as a perverse new form of entertain- ment. The supermarket tabloids long ago understood the profit potential of such a mournful situation. They have learned how to regale, week after week, the same tired people in the same ex- hausting checkout lines with ever more ghastly and outrageous crimes and con- spiracies, carried out, always, by the rich and famous. For the tabloid pur- chasers, as with the fans of professional wrestling, belief in what they're seeing and reading is far less important then the momentary frisson of fear, excite- ment and tongue-clucking. \"Imagine! Natalie Wood was mur- dered because Elvis was about to turn her in to Teddy Kennedy as a Soviet counterspy! The paper says that the KGB evidently got to her first. I didn't know Elvis even knew her.\" Or, equal- ly, \"Did you see Hulk Hogan on TV last night? The challenger was trying to strangle him and he was almost dead and the referee really had to save his life.\" Believability in these cases is beside the point. Central is the illusion the fans demand of having been shown the horrible \"truth\" from the inside. With all too many people, juicy conspiracy theories are, like intellectual junk food, as gnawingly necessary to their diets as sugar or fat or alcohol. Though this kind of quasi-paranoia may provide perverse excitement and a pleasant, self-indulgent pastime, it is also partly a by-product of real govern- ment behavior. We all remember Watergate, Nixon's lies, the lies of the Reagan administration on Iran-Contra, the decades of coverup on the UFO issue, the S & L scandal and on and on. Sadly, we have good reason to be constantly suspicious of our leaders. Even worse is the fact that as political and international affairs have grown more complex and depressing, so has the texture of daily life itself. Taken together, AIDS, crime, drugs, pollution and the state of the economy have created a, deep uncertainty about the future, leading inexorably to what might be called a national feeling of help- lessness. In this unstable context the desire for simple answers spreads and becomes ever more urgent. Ambigui- ty becomes intolerable. We want to know! The ground is set for the doom- sayer, the charlatan, the one who makes sense of it all by telling us who or what to blame. Whoever exposes the \"plot that created this mess\" will ride high. O f course, a tragic historical precedent immediately comes to mind: Germany in the late twenties and early thirties. There, runaway inflation, unemployment and social chaos had many causes, too com- plex to be easily understood. But one man came forward with a simple answer; all these troubles were the result of plots by the communists and the Jewish bankers, Q.E.D. . We know who presented that mindless idea and what its horrendous results were; the lesson is clear. From this comes what I'll call the First Hopkins Law of Social Behavior in Dif- ficult Times: \"The greater the complex- ity of the problem, the greater the ap- peal of any simple solution, no matter how stupid, false or irrelevant.\" While on a visit to Santa Barbara recently, two parallel situations came to mind to illustrate my behavioral law and the power of conspiracy thinking. A fascinating article in California Magazine dealt with a man who believes in \"taking government back from its false leaders\" and giving it to the world's peoples. He propounds his outwardly unexceptionable ideas wherever and whenever the chance arises, but he states the dark side of the \"plot against the people\" as an established fact: a major political figure was assassinated before he was able to speak the truth. Wendell Wilkie, he avers, was the assassination victim, and the story that Wilkie died of a heart at- tack in 1944 was a mere invention. The man who says these things is a soap manufacturer who calls himself Dr. Bronner, though he refers to himself also as a rabbi. He is neither a rabbi nor a medical doctor, and Bronner is not the name he was given at birth, but we will let those issues pass; conspiracy theorists are never strong on facts. Bronner has a simple theory, freighted with paranoid notions, and though he was evidently hospitalized for psych- ological reasons at some point in his life, that circumstance has not prevented him from developing something of a following around the country. Ap- parently there really are Bronnerites about, discussing the Wilkie assassina- tion and the powerful secret forces that once drugged their leader and im- prisoned him in a mental hospital. Cooper A man named William Cooper, who speaks frequently about UFOs, presents an interesting parallel with Doctor/ Rabbi Bronner. Like the Doctor/Rab- bi, Cooper's credentials - in this case as a self-proclaimed highly-placed Naval Intelligence man - are somewhat cloudy. (There is also confusion about the reason for his discharge from the service.) But Cooper's message, like Bronner's, is simple, though infinitely MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"I \"The greater the complexity of the problem, the greater the appeal o/any simple solution, no mat- ter how stupid, false or irrelevant.\" Brenner's, is simple, though infinitely more grandiose: A vast plot has been going on for decades, and many assassinations have occurred as a result. Though Cooper's set of villains left Wendell Wilkie alone, and presumably also Orville Faubus and some others, they shot John Kennedy in the Dallas motorcade \"to prevent him from reveal- ing what he knew about UFOs.\" I once raised the issue with one of Cooper's supporters as to why the CIA plotters, who evidently had intimate ac- cess to their victim, didn't simply put something in Kennedy's toothpaste or use another of their more subtle and ef- fective assassination methods, one that might better have concealed the crime. The Cooperite explained to me that the reason Kennedy was shot by his driver (!) during the parade - an act that re- quired the killer to turn around and fire point blank in the direction of Mrs. Ken- nedy and Governor and Mrs. Connally while he steered the automobile with the other hand and passed in front of a movie camera and hundreds of obser- vant witnesses - was because that scenario would later sound so outrageous that it would not be believed. Thus, the Cooperite said triumphantly, the crime could be easily concealed. What I learned from this exchange is valuable: never try to outflank paranoid thinking. It's an attempt doomed to failure, like arguing religion with a street-corner evangelist. Now, though I have never heard Rab- bi/Doctor Bronner speak - he is in his eighties and still quite energetic -1 have heard Cooper in full harangue. He is most impressive. As deep-voiced, pas- sionate, expressive, and convincing as Joseph McCarthy himself - a man he uncannily resembles - Cooper can rouse his Cooperites to a mystical, patriotic fervor. Despite his serious drinking pro- blem, the late Senator from Wisconsin could roll off a list of Communist agents, spies, fellow-travelers, dupes and so on with scornful power and convic- tion. In a parallel manner - whether or not he shares the Senator's taste for the bottle - Cooper can lay out his list of spies, CIA men, fellow-travelers, assassins and so on, with a similarly orotund fervor and hatred. It's a perfor- ming skill lost in this country since the early fifties, and not visible in Europe since the nineteen thirties. It should be seen once and never emulated. Followers Though Rabbi/Doctor Bronner has evidently decided to leave me alone, Highly-Placed-Former-Naval-Intelli- gence-Agent Cooper has not. One of the leading Cooperites is a New York City skin doctor currently undergoing hearings as to whether or not he is too mentally impaired to be allowed to practice medicine. (He has been diagnosed as \"paranoid, delusional and grandoise.\") This somewhat unsteady physician, whom I knew very briefly in 1981 and '82, has decided in the intervening eight years that I am a very, very bad per- son. He now accuses me directly of complicity in the murders of both Dr. Martin Luther King and President John F. Kennedy. He has informed Cooper that I once told him I was a CIA agent. He has also informed Cooper that a woman acquaintance of his, a secretary from Massachusetts, told him that she, too, was a CIA agent. Cooper has trustingly broadcast these slanderous allegations widely. The assumption behind the doctor's revelations is simple: CIA undercover agents habitually walk up to der- matologists whose secrets they are try- ing to pry away and say, \"By the way, I'm a CIA agent.\" (In much the same way that CIA assassins of presidents choose to do it before the cameras and under the watchful gaze of thousands of people at a formal parade.) This New York City skin doctor also recently ac- cused the men fixing the sidewalk near his office of being spies, and left a message on my answering machine thanking me for causing him to join the Communist party. Cooper has ap- parently chosen not to trumpet these latter statements of his associate in his various public appearances. It has been said, truthfully, that a paranoid can instantly make order out of chaos. If you or I, travelling on a vacation, have a flat tire one day and a reversal at the Vegas craps table the next, we accept these events as unfor- tunate pieces of bad luck. A paranoid thinker, however, not only knows that the two events are absolutely connected, but he knows who did them and why. The rest of us are stuck with the fact that life is messy, unpredictable, and at best serendipitous. Worse, we're de- prived of those subtle little masochistic thrills experienced by conspiracy buffs when they are told about the True Cabal or the Central Plot; when they under- stand just which UFO researchers are involved in political shootings, which movie stars are secret necrophiliacs and which famous rock musician turned Natalie Wood over to the KGB. It's all so exciting! Intrigues between George Bush, the Trilateral Commission and alien invaders, secret meetings with Dan Quayle in underground bases, perhaps with Doctor/Rabbi Bronner, discussing how much more smoothly the CIA pulled off the Wilkie caper than the Kennedy crime. Which leads me to a few final obser- vations. Logic decrees that when veteran UFO researchers tell you again and again that your government is covering up official knowledge of the UFO phenomenon, and thereby lying to you, those researchers are obvious- ly not working for the government. Likewise, anyone vociferously debunk- ing the UFO phenomenon, and claim- ing that the government is telling the truth, may actually be on the federal payroll. And anyone claiming that the UFO phenomenon is real, and who then goes on with outrageous malarkey about the mass murder of American children as a CIA project - that person may be trying to discredit serious UFO Continued on page 22 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Current Case Log Dan Wright, Deputy Director, Investigations The following summarizes case reports received in November and December 1990 which are well prepared and represent recent events of significance to UFOIogy. Unless noted, no sound, vibration or odor was detected. All times listed are local. • Log #901104: 10/24/90, 2:45 p.m. event in Louisville, Kentucky); in- vestigator Bun Monroe. A woman was operating a fax machine in her 12th floor office. Glancing out the window, she noticed a stationary, silvery, flat- bottomed disc below her level against a backdrop of trees. About 20 feet in diameter, its only feature initially was an upturned rim. Momentarily, the object began mov- ing slowly upward and away in an arc, then proceeded back and forth in half- circle paths, alternately displaying its black underside while continually moving farther away. The witness was joined by a second woman, then a man who alone saw a second vehicle, boomerang shaped, merge with the first in the distance. Perhaps two miles dis- tant, the objects suddenly disappeared from view. Duration was estimated as 10 minutes. • Log #901116: (7/73/90, 7p.m. event near Manchester, New Hampshire); in- vestigator Ruth Michaud. In her bedroom, a teen observed a brilliant light rise from, and hover over, a wetland across the road and a few hun- dred feet away. Momentarily, she realiz- ed this was the forward light of a tapered cylindrical object as it rotated to reveal its length. A series of square lights or windows were equally spaced across the midsection of its dark metallic grey surface. At one end was a horizontal cable, at the end of which was a red light. The object proceeded laterally until lost beyond a line of trees. Duration was less than a minute. • Log #901206: (10/10/90 event in the Hoyt Lakes region near Skibo, Min- nesota); investigators Bill McNeffand Richard Bauerlein. At about 9 p.m., local residents began reporting unusual lights in the sky southeast of Hoyt Lakes. Two local policemen respond- ed, driving within a mile of the site. In the company of other witnesses, they observed multiple objects of indeter- minate shape, alternately hovering and darting about at an estimated altitude of 10,000+ feet. These were described as glowing white, with attached red and green lights. Following a series of ambiguous returns, at 10:15 p.m. the FAA air traf- fic control tower at the Duluth Airport confirmed radar echoes from the Hoyt Lakes area. The targets appeared inter- mittently over the next hour on two separate radars at that facility. One of the Duluth controllers con- tinously monitored the roughly circular formation variously comprising three to five objects. One of these repeated- ly and abruptly left the grouping, only to reverse direction and resume its posi- tion. An Air National Guard facility likewise called the Duluth tower to ex- press puzzlement over targets appear- ing on its radar screen. During this period, the Duluth staff contacted a commercial pilot flying at 11,000 feet and 40-50 miles west of Hoyt Lakes. The pilot sighted two distinct, steady lights below his altitude and a few miles apart, both described as deep glowing red. The night was clear with excellent visibility. No known weather factors would account for the radar returns, and no other con- ventional aircraft was reported in the area. • Log #901205: (March 12,1990,1:30 a.m. event in Marshfield, Massachu- setts); investigator Morton Schafer. A woman was lying awake in bed at 11:30 p.m. when she heard a crash in the house. Downstairs, she discovered an overturned chair in front of a partially opened door leading to the sunroom. Finding no other evidence of an in- truder, she decided to remain up and watch a late night TV movie. At 1:30 a.m., loud knocking sounds began from the crawl space beneath the livingroom flooring. Soon, she ran upstairs to awaken her husband, noting the clock read 1:37. He suggested a rac- coon as the culprit and returned to sleep. She retrieved a flashlight and shone it through each first-floor window on- to the lawn to no avail. Next, she entered the sunroom and raised a screen to check the ground-level door to the crawl space. Leaning out, she found the door still shut, but the heavy frame was detached and lying on the grass. As she began to straighten up, she confronted an alien face six inches from her own. The \"boy-sized being\" was perhaps 3 1/2 feet tall and floating above the ground. She noted an oval head with large black, almond-shaped eyes; smooth, charcoal grey skin; a small slit mouth; and nostrils with a distinct nose bridge. No hair or ears were visible. The entity wore a dark, loose capelike garment. His four-digited left hand was raised next to her face. After what seemed several seconds of shocked amazement, the woman dropped her flashlight, pulled herself back in, and ran upstairs to alert her husband. She then noted the time was 2:30. (Notes: The husband confirmed the following morning that she had entered the bedroom at 1:37 and 2:30 a.m. Hypnotherapy conducted in subsequent months reportedly reveal- ed a physical abduction, commencing with her being pulled through the open screen.)

A woman was inside her parents' farmhouse when she heard the family's several dogs raising a commotion. Looking out the kitchen window, she spotted a glowing white disc hovering low over the pasture. She ran to the bedroom to wake her father, and they both proceeded outside in time to see the object go over the house and continue slowly into the distance. A high-pitched sound was likened to a combined dishwasher and air condi- tioner, while a strong sulphur odor was present. It darkened when angling down over nearby hills and out of sight. Dura- tion was estimated as two minutes. The vehicle was further described as perhaps 100 feet in diameter. A steady yellow light shone at the top of its rounded dome. Near the flat bottom was a continuous row of steady red lights. A large opening on the under- side was bright white, surrounding which was a gridlike perimeter likened to criss-crossed metal strips. The area was checked the next day, but no landing marks were found. Use of a compass below the initial site of the object's hovering over the pasture showed no deviation from a normal directional reading. All cattle and other animals were accounted for. • Log #901208: (9/20/90, 8:30p.m. event in Leominster, Massachusetts); investigator Bill Goffrier. A man with a disabled auto was waiting at a freeway exit for a tow truck. He noticed a green- ish glowing oval hovering low in the sky. Seconds later, the light proceeded downward across the highway and halted before a line of trees 80 feet distant. Fearful but intrigued, the witness said aloud, \"Don't hurt me, but come closer.\" It then approached to within 15 feet and came to rest on the grass. The anomaly was described as a green, horizontal oval 18 inches in diameter, within which were two black teardrop shapes outlined in white. These had a pulsating effect. When freeway traffic approached, the light/object was not visible, whether by reason of an optical effect or otherwise. It was last seen just before the tow truck arrived. Duration was estimated as about one minute. (Note: No mark was discovered on the grass afterward.) • Log #901210: (4/17/90,10:30-11:00 p.m. event in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania); investigators Evelyn Schurman and Keith Bastianini. Two women were driving through a wood- ed area of Upper BurreU Township when they spotted three bright lights in the clear sky ahead. A moment later, the driver realized \"... a split in the sky, one half was completely black and the other half all stars,\" to her left. Im- mediately, they heard a loud \"click\" and saw a luminous, basketball-sized green light 30 yards away just over the treetops. Stopping the car, they watch- ed as the ball descended a foot or two before hovering again, illuminating the ground in an \"aluminum\" color. Now they discerned a black object roughly the size and shape of a bus, to which the green ball may have been at- tached. Along the near side were two rows of three rectangular windows that cast a dull yellow light. An inner border around each consisted of a neon-like tube, seemingly filled with a \"gurg- ling,\" yellow-orange luminescent li- quid. The two sets of windows were separated by a band which appeared to encircle the object and rotate. Having perhaps been \"in a trance\" for a short period, the driver started the car forward. The rider, whose view had been partly obscured, then was able to confirm the object's shape behind them, ; estimating its length as about 40 feet. As she continued to watch, the upper and lower rows of windows appeared to merge into a single ribbon of light. A short distance down the road they saw a luminous cigar-shaped object in the sky, which they assumed was the same. Reaching the rider's home, they ran inside. From a window, they observed the glowing object change course and pass overhead. Duration of the event was estimated as 20 minutes. (Notes: During the experience and for the remainder of the night, both women felt dazed, and months later both expressed a feeling of having ex- perienced more than they could con- sciously recall. The driver returned the following day to search for possible physical traces, but found none. A local policeman, the county's emergency management coordinator, checked the area for radiation, but found nothing unusual. In the sighting vicinity is the Alcoa Light Metals Research Facility, which reportedly is involved in Stra- tegic Defense Initiative technology.)

Notional Conference on Anomalous Experiences The first National Conference on Anomalous Experiences convened at the Albert M. Greenfield Conference Center (Sugarloaf), Temple University in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania on January 18-20, 1991, organized and hosted by David M. Jacobs, Ph.D. and Budd Hopkins. Due to space limitations at the executive conference center, on- ly 50 people were invited. Invitations were extended by the host committee to professionals, clinicians, eight ab- ductees and a few investigators who are directly involved in the study and research of UFO abductions, and/or were on the planning committee. The Friday and Saturday sessions were divided into \"Introductory Talks,\" \"Hypnosis: Problems and Techniques,\" and \"Coping: Issues and Problems.\" Following the pattern of the very suc- cessful abduction panel at the MUFON 1987 International UFO Symposium at American University in Washington, DC, an abductee panel of four ladies and four men provided the professional clinicians with first hand exposure to their traumatic experiences, how each coped with their fears, how support groups helped them, and how they are reconstructing their lives to meet the future. We are thankful to the eight courageous people who bared their traumatic experiences publicly. The en- tire conference was moderated by Michael Swords, Ph.D. of Western Michigan University in his own humorous and inimitable style. Sunday morning was devoted to \"Facing the Problem: Research in the 1990s,\" a general discussion of issues and problems of abduction research, education, and direction, utilizing a workshop format. At the beginning of this discussion Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs jointly issued a historic announcement to the conferees that will dramatically affect the future of abduc- tion research. Robert Bigelow of Las Vegas, Nevada and a vitally concerned anonymous donor, have jointly donated a grant of $200,000 to initiate a study of the crucial abduction phenomenon. Jacobs and Hopkins were named the project directors. The goals and objectives of this bomb-shell announcement were delineated: • To determine the best possible estimate of the percentage of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"American public that has had a UFO abduction experience. • To assemble and codify high quali- ty information into the largest volume of well-documented cases pertaining to this phenomenon. • The completion date has been targeted for December 1, 1991, when all findings of this study shall be con- cluded and organized into a publishable form. At this stage of UFO abduction research, the $200,000 grant almost rivals that of the U.S. Air Force to the University of Colorado in 1968. Under the direction of Dr. Edward U. Condon, the half-million dollar report released in 1969, titled \"Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects,\" was hard- ly a definitive explanation for the UFO phenomenon as the government had predicted and expected. I am confident that this two-hundred thousand dollar grant will be spent more judiciously than the infamous \"Condon Report\" expenditure was. Both Robert Bigelow and the anonymous donor fully recognize the importance of the abduction phenomenon, thus their thoughtful and appreciated financial support. Their contribution is truly a milestone in UfolOgy that may open the doors of the world to the UFO enigma, a mystery that has lasted for over 43 years. As a small token, the Mutual UFO Network donated one thousand dollars to the conference to help defray ex- penses. The Intruders Foundation (IF) contributed additional funds. — Walt Andrus 1991 UFO Conference Charles Hickson and Associates have announced that the \"1991 UFO Con- ference: It Has Begun\" will be held Saturday, March 23, 1991 from 1:30 to 11:00 p.m. at the Coliseum in Biloxi, Mississippi.

Fund Report The primary activity during this quarter involved \"Crash II,\" a con- ference consisting of investigators and witnesses involved in the reported crash and recovery of one or more Uniden- tified Flying Objects. It was the second such conference coordinated by the Fund, but it was remarkable because it included ten witnesses who had in- formation about the recovery of at least one apparent alien craft and bodies out- side Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. (The conference was made possi- ble by a special contribution.) All of the witnesses (with one excep- tion) agreed to be identified and to have their statements recorded on videotape for archival and other purposes. At the conclusion of the conference, the Fund's Executive Committee solicited proposals from the investigators, in- cluding Stanton T. Friedman, Donald R. Schmitt and Kevin Randle, to inter- view and videotape additional witnesses in the Roswell case. All of those involved agreed that the information gathered at the conference and in subsequent interviews should be assembled into a briefing paper and a videotape to be made available to Members of the United States Con- gress. Researchers hope to convince an appropriate congressional committee to hold hearings requiring testimony from former military employees who have refused to discuss their involvement in the event on the grounds of national security. Schmitt and Randle subsequently submitted a request for $6,600 to inter- view 24 additional witnesses in the Roswell case. Another investigator in UFO crash/retrieval cases, Leonard H. Stringfield, requested up to $1,500 for further research in the Roswell case. An additional proposal to edit the inter- views with witnesses in the Roswell case at a cost of approximately $2,000 was submitted resulting in a goal to raise $10,000 for follow-up research in the Roswell case. A letter outlining the proposed fund- raising campaign was to be mailed to all of the Fund's supporters by the end of the year. To encourage enough large donations to meet the goal of $10,000, copies of the congressional briefing paper will be offered to contributors of $50 or more; a copy of the videotape will be offered to contributors of $100 or more. A report on the progress of the fundraising effort will appear in the next Quarterly Report. Also during this period, the Ex- ecutive Committee of the Fund received a proposal from noted abduction re- searcher Budd Hopkins to do a statis- tical study of a selected number of high- quality abduction cases. It is hoped that such a study will uncover correlations and \"undiscovered links\" between key elements of abductions. The proposal in its most comprehensive form would cost approximately $6,000, which would require a substantial infusion of funds to support. Also received during the quarter was a proposal by Dr. Leslie E. Wong of The Evergreen College in Olympia, Washington, for the study of Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in abductees. This grant proposal for $7,115 would involve follow-up research of 50-60 respondents to a questionnaire- based pilot study of abductees under- taken by two students at the college earlier this year. The purpose of the study is to determine whether the ab- duction phenomenon causes PTSD in some abductees. Such a finding would make a substantial contribution, not on- ly to abduction research, but also to the field of mental health. The Fund again this year made a cash award in the memory of Isabel Davis to the recipient of the Mutual UFO Net- work's Outstanding UFOlogist Award, who is selected annually by MUFON members. This year, the recipient was Richard Hall, former acting director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena and currently a member of the Fund's Board of Direc- tors. The cash award was $500. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"In Others' Words ...

Lt. Com- mander Robert Wood, the ship's opera- tions officer and an air controller, were manning one of the radars at the time. \"We were plotting all the aircraft go- ing north and south along the coast and inland as far as the Appalachian Moun- tain range, and any objects that were coming in from the northeast, the east and the southeast,\" Wood said. \"Every aircraft had to have a certain set of parameters, distances, heights and whatnot, on their point of arrival over us. \"On this particular night, it was about 11:30 one night in February, I forget the exact date, this object came in from the east and got within about 30 miles of us when it just stopped dead. It had been moving rather slowly, about 85 to 90 knots. We didn't have the altitude- determining radar on at the time and we had to get one of the operators to come up. When he did, we found the object was somewhere in the neighbor- hood of 3,000 to 4,000 feet altitude. This object gave us a blip on the radar screen about the size of a large aircraft, like a DC-9. I phoned the bridge and they informed the captain, who ordered the ship to head out in the direction of the object. \"We got to within about 15 miles of the object when it suddenly took off at a very high rate of speed. It was going so rapidly that as the radar turned we could see the blip just jumping across the screen. We estimated it was going 5,000 kilometers an hour or roughly 3,000 miles an hour. Then, when it got up within 35 or 40 miles south of Nan- tucket Island, it suddenly just took off and went straight up! I called the bridge and said, 'We're loosing contact, the object is fading.' And the operator on the altitude-determining radar in the other end of the room said, 'No! I've still got it! It's 100 miles high and it's still going straight up!' The object then faded from the second radar.\" They had tracked the object for about 45 minutes. (Report On A Survey of the Member- ship of the American Astronomical Society Concerning the UFO Problem, by P.A. Sturrock; The World News, New York, NY, 5/1/82.) • At 7 a.m. on the 19th, a Lodestar airliner, with nine passengers and a crew of two aboard, took off from an airport at Nairobi, Kenya Colony, East Africa. All went well until 7:20 a.m., when the radio officer and Captain J. Bicknell spotted a bright, stationary ob- ject about 10,000 feet over Mount Kilimanjaro. Bicknell estimated the ob- ject was over 200 feet long, bullet- shaped, a dull silver color and marked at regular intervals along the fuselage with vertical dark bands. It appeared to be constructed of metal and was ab- solutely stationary. The huge object was observed by the passengers and crew for about 17 minutes until it started to move. The sides of the awesome craft were clearly seen to be without a break in their smoothness; it had a perfectly streamlined hull. It moved out of sight at a speed estimated to be 1,000 miles per hour, leaving behind no vapor trail. To all who saw it, it had no visible means of propulsion. (Saucers magazine, September 1954.) • 1956 It was about 11 p.m. on the 18th when a mysterious blip suddenly appeared on a radar screen at Orly Air- port, Paris, France. The radar operator summoned his colleagues and warned the tower. For here was something unusual: an \"echo\" twice as large as the echo of the largest known aircraft, and one that behaved in a manner quite Unlike anything the operator had ever seen before. It came to a complete stop, then accelerated at incredible speeds. Soon after it appeared, radar showed it to be directly over Gometz-le-Chatel. Thirty seconds later it was 30 kilo- meters away (18 miles), over Boissy Saint Leger, moving nearly 2,250 miles per hour. On radar the UFO was observed pursuing two large aircraft and being pursued by a DC-3. The crew reported that the \"glowing red light\" was blinking and disappeared into a cloud. They could see a large, dark outline but could not discern a shape. The object finally disappeared from radar after maneuvering over a radius of about 50 kilometers (30 miles) for about four hours. (Herald Tribune, NY, 2/21/56; Flying Saucer Review, March- April 1956.) • 1976 Leonard Hegele, 29, was driving on Interstate 15, south of Great Falls, Montana, about 10 a.m. on the 22nd when he spotted a large, huma- noid being walking in a field about a quarter of a mile from the highway. He briefly pursued the being on foot, but retreated when his quarry stopped walking and turned to face Hegele. \"I was carrying a .357 magnum pistol,\" Hegele said. \"But when he turned around, I felt completely defenseless.\" Hegele said he also saw a gray, oval : shaped craft hovering in the air about a half-mile from the highway. Hegele said the being was about seven feet tall with shoulders at least three feet wide. The being was described as \"solid and muscular,\" although Hegele said he did not get close enough to determine if it was covered with hair. Although humanoid in appearance, Hegele said the being's size, length of stride and manner of walking were distinctive. \"It was no human,\" he said. The being was walking, arms swing- ing at its sides, along a knoll parallel MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February W91"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"to the highway. Hegele said he stopped his vehicle and after climbing through a fence and crossing a frontage road, began running after the being, which continued walking. Hegele, who said he was active in track in high school, reported he could only cut the distance between them in half by running at full speed. When Hegele closed to within 700 to 800 feet, the being stopped walk- ing and, lowering his arms, turned to face his pursuer. Making no attempt to hide his fright, Hegele said he im- mediately reversed course and ran back to his vehicle. The being made no menacing gesture, he said. Hegele said he noticed the airborn craft while he was chasing the being. The craft hovered only about 10 feet above the ground, but periodically ascended and descended another 15 feet. (The Tribune, Great Falls, MT, 2/23/76.) • 1981 Two pilots reported that a UFO with bright, pulsating red light buzzed their small plane over San Jose, California Municipal Airport on the ninth, then followed them briefly before disappearing. The object, about 10 feet in diameter, was spotted simultaneously by two controllers in the airport tower who were unable to detect the object on radar. The encounter was reported at 10:40 p.m. by pilot Gary Rounds, 21, and his passenger, Charles Shackleford, 20. \"We were practicing touch-and-goes (landings and takeoffs). I was taking off and climbing out about 600 feet when I looked to my right and saw another aircraft,\" said Rounds. \"It was this bright, red pulsating light,\" said Shackleford, who also is a pilot. Suddenly the light appeared to head straight for their rented Cessna 150. \"He was close to us. I thought, 'Man, he's going to descend on top of us,' \" Shackleford said. While Rounds took evasive action, Shackleford radioed the San Jose tower. \"We saw it,\" said air controller Rich Gutterud. \"The thing was coming right at him. He had to ex- tend upward (climb above) from whatever it was.\" Then the red light in- stantly appeared behind the Cessna. \"It was really wild. First it was in front of us. The next thing we knew it was right behind us,\" said Shackleford. Gutterud and air controller Randy Blount, who both witnessed the aerial display, said the light briefly followed the plane, \"making very tight turns. It hovered. Then it just took off at an extremely high rate of speed,\" Gutterud said. \"It was strange. We could see it. But there was nothing on the radar. It never showed on the radar at all.\" The mysterious red light form re- turned to San Jose on the 19th. \"It was flying real slow, then all of a sudden it took off fast and headed down,\" said Al Backer, who lives near the airport. \"We saw it too,\" said a controller at the airport. \"It was a steady red light when it passed over us. Then it started flashing and went straight out so fast it went out of the line of sight. And again, it didn't show up on the radar.\" The incident occurred a few minutes after 10:00 p.m. (The Mercury, San Jose, CA, 2/11/81; The News, San Jose, CA, 2/20/81.) • A 17-year-old girl had a bizarre close encounter at 1:45 a.m. on the 14th. She was baby-sitting at a neigh- bor's house in Greensburg, Penn- sylvania, when she spotted an object at housetop level no more than 50 feet away, hovering silently with three white lights forming the points of an equilateral triangle. Her impression was that the object was triangular and made from dark-colored metal. The light closest to the witness was much brighter than the other two, and just above it was a transparent window. To the left and right of the front pane, separated by thin metallic-like partitions, were two win- dows that wrapped around the sides of the craft. A very dull, white light, similar to a flashlight beam, extended from the underside to the ground. The girl said she saw the beam slowly des- cend until it reached the street. The young woman said she could look directly into the craft through the front window, where she observed two humanoid beings. She described them as having \"very large heads, oriental- like eyes, gill-like ears and two holes instead of a nose.\" One occupant ap- peared to be sitting and the other stand- ing behind an instrument panel. The panel was white. The entire scene ap- peared to be illuminated by a white light. Only the head and hands of the sitting being were visible as it operated several controls. The panel also con- tained groups of black and grayish- black circular controls. The other occupant was visible from the waist up and was not wearing a shirt. It had a long, thin neck, broad shoulders, smooth white skin and normal-looking arms. The being was extending its arms back and forth across a section of the instrument panel that had no controls. It stared at the witness with pupil-less white eyes. The girl was unable to recall the hands or mouth of either occupant. She was spellbound by the strange phenomenon and felt com- pelled to stand on the porch and watch for approximately 15 minutes before she reluctantly went back into the living room. She then called her parents to come for her and the young boy. When her father arrived at 2:50 a.m., the ob- ject had disappeared. (The Tribune- Democrat, Johnstown, PA, 4/17/81.) • Lavell Morales and her daughter Dawn, 18, spotted a large orange and gray object just off U.S. Highway 271 near Owentown, Texas, about 9 p.m. on the 23rd. \"It was huge, taller than a building. And it was hovering to the right of us, just off the highway,\" Mrs. Morales said. The craft was \"about a car's length\" above the ground and \"the top of it was turning. It looked like a fruit jar lid. There were orange lights, bright orange lights,\" she said. \"The bottom was grayish, and it wasn't mov- ing.\" Mrs. Morales said she was the first to spot the phenomenon. When she tried to draw her daughter's attention to the object, she couldn't. \"It put me in a light trance. I couldn't get my eyes off of it. I couldn't tell her to look at it.\" There was \"an energy field of some kind\" coming from the strange craft, according to Mrs. Morales, that almost forced her car off the highway and into a ditch. \"You're going off the road!\" Mrs. Morales remembers her daughter saying. Then Dawn sighted the object, blurting out, \"Oh my god!\" and started to cry. \"I think it was her (Dawn's) Continued on page 21 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The UFO Press Journal of UFO Studies, New Series, Vol. 2, The J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies Chicago, 1990, paper, 195 pp., $15. Reviewed by Dennis Stacy This is the second such publication from CUFOS, but the first, to the best of my knowledge, under the extremely capable editorship of Michael Swords, a professor of natural sciences at Western Michigan University, Kala- mazoo, and a frequent contributor to the MUFON Journal. Any ufologist with a pretense of scientific interest in his or her chosen field should do themselves and this project a favor by immediately sitting down, writing out a check in the amount of $15, and mail- ing it to the Center for UFO Studies, 2457 W. Peterson Ave., Chicago, IL, 60659 (Tel. 312-271-3611). The contents themselves are fairly far-ranging, as might be expected from something as amorphous and com- prehensive as ufology itself. There are the almost standard letters of commen- tary to the editor, book reviews and, this time around, an issues forum centered on the Tectonic Stress Theory. In ad- dition, there are three technical papers focusing on various psychological aspects of the UFO experience, along with an historical overview of Australian ufology. In the first of the technical papers, John Wilson of the Department of Psychology, Cleveland State Universi- ty, looks at similarities between Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Experienced Anomalous Trauma (EAT). Specifically, Wilson compares the psychological stress encountered in exposure to invisible toxic contaminants with stress reported in the wake of the abduction experience. June O. Parnell and Leo Sprinkle contribute a paper entitled \"Personali- ty Characteristics of Persons Who Claim UFO Experiences,\" based on a study using the standard Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) as given to 142 female and 83 male subjects. According to the ab- stract, \"participants exhibited a high level of psychic energy, a tendency to question authority or experience situa- tional pressures or conflicts, and to be self-sufficient and resourceful. Other characteristics were: above average in- telligence, assertiveness, a tendency to be experimenting thinkers, a tendency toward a reserved attitude, and a tendency toward assertiveness. \"No overt psychopathology was in- dicated. Participants in the study who claimed communication with extrater- restrials had a significantly greater tendency to endorse unusual feelings, thoughts and attitudes; to be suspicious or distrustful; and to be creative, imag- inative, or possibly have schizoid tendencies.\" A second psychological survey is provided by Kenneth Ring and Christopher Rosing of the Uni- versity of Connecticut, Storrs, as part of the ongoing Omega Project, an in- vestigation into the Near Death Ex- perience. Again from the abstract: \"Results showed that persons reporting abductions were psychologically in- distinguishable from those who had other types of UFO encounters. However, UFO experiencers in general, while not more fantasy-prone than their controls, reported more sensitivity to non-ordinary realities as children, as well as a higher incidence of child abuse and trauma than controls. They also reported far more psychological changes following their encounters than did controls. \"An especially intriguing finding of this study was that UFO experiencers and near-death experiencers are highly comparable psychologically and are af- fected similarly by their separate en- counters, suggesting that these two categories of experiences may in many ways be functionally equivalent.\" Some laymen and women may find such typical academic language off- putting, but perseverance has its pro- fits. Moreover, not all the Journal is presented in technical fashion, as evidenced by the overview of ufology in Australia, authored by Keith Raster- field, Vladimir and Pony Godic of UFO Research Australia, and Mark Rodeghier of CUFOS. Another useful \"trick\" up editor Swords' sleeve is the Issues Forum, \"the major means,\" in his own words, \"whereby JUFOS attempts to be both academic and 'human,' and to allow a professional means whereby differences of opinion may be aired in a respectful manner aimed at the advance of the research field.\" In other words, a par- ticular topic or hypothesis is isolated, and critics and adherents are allowed to have at it. In this case the issue is Earthlights, as hypothesized by Paul Devereux, and the Tectonic Stress Theory, as put forth by Michael Persinger. The respondents, or commentators, are Chris Rutkowski and Drs. Michael Grosso, David Jacobs and Michael Swords. This section alone occupies pages 99 to 176, while the give-and-take commentary runs from the reasoned to the acerbic. All in all, this second volume of JUFOS is an encouraging debut for editor Swords and the other con- tributors, and it should not be lightly overlooked. Such a publication is.a credit to the field in several important ways. Not only does it make a signifi- cant contribution to specialized UFO studies on its own, it also serves a much wider purpose of being the perfect public relations ploy for the field, a way of indicating to \"orthodox\" science and scientists that UFOs are indeed a sub- ject worthy of serious study. Now it's up to grass roots ufologists to support this ambitious venture with their pocketbooks, rather than casual lip service. Write the check today, and maybe we won't have to wait another year for the next issue.

Volume 2, The Emergence of a Phenomenon dealing with the history of the UFO controversy through 1959, will be published in 1991. Dear John: I was amused to read your rejoinders to Stanton Friedman, Don Schmitt and Kevin Randle in the January 1991 issue of Fate (\"The Roswell Furor,\" pp 55-69). In this changing world it's something of a relief to see that you haven't lost your touch. As an enter- tainer you're top notch. As somebody from whom serious people looking for a rational perspective on the UFO phenomenon should seek guidance, well ... Your recent article reminded me of a favorite expression of former Fate editor Mary Fuller's, always uttered after reading a particularly fatuous manuscript from a would-be con- tributor: \"There's not a fact in a carload here!\" You don't even seem to know what's in your own books. You refer, for example, to UFOs: Operation Tro- jan Horse, asserting that samples of the Corona \"hieroglyphics\" (I assume that's what you mean by \"that material\") were published there. They were not, nor, your implication to the contrary, is the Roswell incident men- tioned anywhere. Stan, Don and Kevin will have no trouble cutting up your arguments, which seem to have more to do with unfettered imagination than with evidence or documentation; but then that wonderful imagination of yours has always been your stock in trade, and that's fine (though I could do without the ad hominem stuff that always ac- companies it). Nonetheless I can't resist asking a couple of obvious questions: (1) Where in the world, for example, did you get the idea that the material consisted of a \"truckload of paper\"? Since you put those words in quotation marks, surely you have a source. (2) Can you cite the name of one firsthand witness who agrees that the object was a balloon? It's all fine and dandy to in- sult informants or speculate about the nefarious reasons for their stubborn refusal to provide testimony that con- forms to what you want to believe, but surely among the many people who saw the material, there must be somebody who told the tale you need to hear. Let's have his name and his account. The people who've done the real work at Roswell have provided the names and accounts of plenty of people who tell another kind of story. It would be an unskeptical inquirer indeed who would take your theory seriously without a single confirmation anywhere. Anyway, that aside, I want to return to a subject I addressed in a letter last year — a letter to which, perhaps understandably, you did not respond, I assume because you could not do so. Let me try again. Repeatedly you say, again without citing any supporting evidence what- ever, that ufologists created the Roswell incident, \"by juggling and manipulating witness testimony\" — something, by the way, that you are doing in rejecting any (which means all) testimony that fails to substantiate the Fugo-balloon \"theory\"; your sole \"informant\" is an alleged \"local historian there\" whose name you \"can no longer recall.\" I'm not accusing you of deliberate dishones- ty, but I don't trust your memory. If that historian exists, let's have his or her name and find out what he or she has in the way of relevant evidence. Y ou write that the \"Roswell thing has been revived every few years.\" As it happens, I am writing a book on the early history of the UFO controversy, and in doing the research I have pored over an enormous amount of material, trying to recon- struct just what early ufologists really thought and what they did. One thing I am writing about is early ufologists' views of crashed-disc claims. I have learned that far from being \"revived every few years,\" Roswell was not even discussed in the UFO literature until 1966, when Frank Edwards briefly dealt with it in Flying Saucers — Serious Business. That same year, in his little- read (and British-published) The Fly- ing Saucer Story, Brinsley Le Poer Trench mentions in passing an English actor's report that while driving through America in \"June 1947\" he thought he heard an \"announcement that a flying saucer had crashed in New Mexico\" — no further details on location or anything else, though judging from the paragraphs that follow, Trench thought this incident was one of those Frank Scully wrote about three years later. Neither treatment, in any case, had any impact. The next findable references are the next year, in Ted Bloecher's Report on the UFO Wave of 1947 and in a Look magazine one-shot called Flying Saucers, where the Roswell incident is treated briefly as a silly mistake resulting from a downed weather balloon. That's the first time / remember hearing about Roswell (I've been interested in UFOs since 1957, so I have a pretty good idea of what ufologists have been talking about since), though I had read Edwards' book the year before. Evidently, in common with just about every other reader, Edwards' account stuck in my memory for about as long as it took to read it. (I didn't read Trench's book.) References to crashed-disc cases in the early literature are surprisingly rare and are largely skeptical; see, for in- stance, Civilian Saucer Intelligence Quarterly Bulletin, September 1952, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"p. 5. None of this discussion mentions Roswell, which in effect sank without a trace within days of the crash. What discussion there was of crashes — not much — focused mostly on the Spitz- bergen story; Scully's yarn (your ac- count of that in Fate is hopelessly mangled, by the way) was universally considered a hoax. The only publisher who regularly ran crash material was Gray Barker, and even he didn't have an abundance of it. Again, none of it involved Roswell. I've also been through the private correspondence of some of the subject's leading figures from the 1950s. Even in private correspondence, discussions of crashes are almost nonexistent. One of the very few available references is a telling one. In the course of some mid-1950s correspondence between Max Miller and Ted Bloecher, Bloecher mentions Scully in passing, and Miller replies that once he met someone who claimed to have been involved in a crash retrieval in New Mexico in the 1940s. Because he had so little interest in the story, Miller didn't take notes and con- fessed that he didn't remember much of what the guy had said. Curiously, what little emerges from the fog of Miller's memory looks rather like the Roswell incident. Yet, far from mani- pulating the guy's story, Miller evident- ly was barely listening to it! You write that \"hordes of UFO ad- vocates passed through New Mexico, most of them stopping in Roswell to blunder into the newspaper office and molest the local people for confirma- tion.\" In reality, the Roswell incident emerged into the consciousness of ufologists only in the late 1970s. Before then there is no evidence even that in- dividual ufologists, much less \"hordes\" of them, trooped to Roswell, much less forced the impressionable folks there to tell them that a UFO had crashed. Unless you provide evidence to the con- trary (and I have challenged you before on this point, only to meet with a tell- ing silence), there is no reason to believe your contamination \"theory.\" The fact of the matter is that the witnesses' testimony has been remark- ably consistent, just as we would ex- pect if they were describing a real and puzzling event, and that when the real investigative work begun over three decades after the fact, nearly every in- terviewed informant said he or she had never spoken with an outsider about it before. It seems to me that if anybody is \"juggling and manipulating witness testimony,\" it is you. Dear Editor: The idea that sinister government in- telligence agents are faking alien abduc- tions using mind control techniques as postulated by Martin Cannon in the Oc- tober 1990 issue of the MUFON Jour- nal is an anemic theory at best, with glaring inconsistencies. At the worst, it borders on deliberately misleading propaganda and disinformation. If we are to believe this miasma of misinformation, we would have to \"deep-six\" tons of information con- firming the reality of alien existence and the hard work of countless ufologists, including Stanton Friedman, Leonard Stringfield, Budd Hopkins, Raymond Fowler, Thomas Bullard, Linda Howe, Bruce Maccabee, David Jacobs and many others. We would also be forced to disregard any historical UFO data in- dicative of alien abductions because Cannon's theory is totally dependent on relatively recent UFO abduction reports. Cannon's hypothesis falls apart on several levels: 1) For this massive con- spiracy of international intelligence agencies to be true, we would have to assume that they have never made any mistakes, and that all of the persons supposedly abducted by human agents instead of aliens have been silenced with 100% effectiveness. Obviously, government mind control techniques are not perfect, as shown by the exam- ple of Robert Lazar. Lazar's memory was impaired but not erased and he revealed a great deal of sensitive information. 2) Cannon assumes that alien im- plants are no more technologically ad- vanced than current human capabilities. However, since we have no alien im- plants to examine, this is a spurious supposition. Implants produced on Earth may be quite primitive in com- parison to alien implants. The fact that alien and human implants might be similar in size or implanted in similar locations and ways is no in- dicator of technological superiority or inferiority. In fact, the size of the implants and the techniques used for implantation may be the optimum ones for all prac- tical purposes. The use of anesthetic darts and tracking collars for control- ling and studying wild animals, for ex- ample, most likely will be around for a very long time. Most tracking collars are designed to wear out after a certain length of time and eventually to be removed by the animal itself. There is no practical reason to design something different or \"more advanced.\" Intelligence agencies may indeed be quite capable of employing advanced mind control techniques and may utilize implanted devices in some cases. However, the most logical use of these modalities would be in controlling in- dividuals engaged in sensitive govern- ment projects such as UFO research - not in controlling the entire population of the United States or other countries! Even the combined efforts of the CIA and KGB would be inadequate for such an unwieldy and preposterous task. That Cannon rather blithely assumes that intelligence agencies have such ubi- quitous and omniscient powers is a much more far-fetched notion than the probability of alien intervention in human society. — Erich A. Aggen Kansas City, MO Well and good, Mr. Aggen, although I must say I find any comments, prior to Mr. Cannon having completed his presentation, somewhat precipitous. Be that as it may, the reasons for publishing \"The Controllers\" were twofold: 1) to stimulate thinking (and that it has obviously done), and 2) to explore some of the technology that might be behind the abduction reports. Even aliens, after all, must have some means of accomplishing that which they are reportedly capable of doing. -DS MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Dear Editor: I'm not sure it's kosher for one MUFON Journal contributor to com- ment on another's offering, but your readership may appreciate a few addi- tional facts concerning Milton W. Cooper, subject of James A. Harder's excellent investigative article in the Oc- tober 1990 issue. Intriguingly, Harder's story overlaps — in a small way — my own research into mind control. Although Cooper does not usually advertise the fact, he once (at a lecture in Twenty-nine Palms, California) admitted to a belief that the government had repeatedly \"beamed\" him, using some sort of electromagnetic mind control device. Is this claim possible? I have, of course, fairly liberal views on the question of whether or not the military has developed experimental techniques of influencing behavior and perception, and I suppose one could, applying a small amount of imagina- tion, cobble together a \"mind control\" scenario to explain I'Affaire Cooper. For example, Cooper alleges that he needed hypnosis to recall the putative GRUDGE 13 briefing documents. Who, I wonder, was the hypnotist? Do transcripts of these sessions exist? Stranger still, Cooper has told several individuals a bizarre story about government agents running his car off the road; as a result of this mishap, he had a leg partially amputated and (ac- cording to one source I spoke to) an operation on his head. I cannot confirm that the cranial surgery took place, but Cooper is indeed a below-the-knee am- putee. Very possibly, the operation was done in a veteran's hospital; somebody should determine which hospital and check records, if possible. On the other hand: Hard experience has taught me to regard individual claims of \"brainwashing\" very cautiously. Cooper has provided no details or evidence to support his allega- tions of electromagnetic harassment. Many observers might reasonably suspect that cries of \"mind control\" can serve as a convenient excuse for aber- rant behavior or perception. Schizo- phrenics and paranoiacs often delude themselves into the belief that unseen exterior forces influence their thoughts and actions. The point is this: We have nothing but Cooper's word that he saw the GRUDGE 13 documents; therefore, our acceptance of his outlandish allegations concerning UFOs and governmental conspiracies depends on our faith in his credibility. Yet his \"mind control\" claim — whether believed or dismissed — seriously damages that credibility. If he lies on that point, he may be ly- ing on others. If he speaks truthfully, then his perceptions may be altered and cannot be trusted. I am not a mental health professional, and thus cannot comment authoritative- ly on Cooper's psychological state. However, I once had a brief personal encounter with the man which may shed additional light on his character. Some months back, I became inter- ested in Cooper's allegation that he pos- sessed documents proving that George Bush used Zapata Oil as a cover for drug smuggling in the 1960s. (Why, one wonders, has Cooper kept these stag- geringly important documents hidden?) I was also concerned about Cooper's claims that the Christie Institute, a public interest law firm, had been \"harassing\" him. I buttonholed him at a recent Whole Life Expo in Los Ange- les and, speaking politely and calmly, confronted him on this point. He im- mediately flew into a volcanic, scream- ing rage — and threatened me with ex- treme violence, in front of witnesses. Some might argue that responsible ufologists simply ought to ignore in- dividuals of this sort. I believe otherwise. Cooper, and others who tell similar tales (e.g., John Grace, George Green, Virgil Armstrong, and so forth), can have a significant sociological effect — perhaps only among the naive, but the naive are numerous. Vallee quite cor- rectly points out that UFO percipients, ignored or underserved by conventional researchers, often turn toward organiza- tions and individuals on \"the fringe.\" I have personally seen this dynamic in action. According to a source I interviewed, Cooper's writings greatly influenced the six AWOL soldiers recently picked up in Gulf Breeze, Florida. More ominously (and perhaps related): I have learned through several sources that a group of individuals in the Southwest, frightened by the current crop of UFO rumors, has formed a paramilitary organization dedicated to freeing the alleged underground base at Dulce, New Mexico from \"alien domination.\" This secretive band has code words, weapons, and — apparently — a cer- tain amount of money. I only hope that this cult of saucerological survivalists doesn't make headlines through some violent, senseless action. Remember: Through his many radio and lecture appearances, Milton Cooper has reached hundreds of thousands of listeners who have never heard of MUFON. He, not you, represents ufology to many people. He is, like it or not, important. — Martin Cannon Canoga Park, CA Dear Editor: I would like to congratulate MUFON on the excellent article on the British \"corn circles.\" In view of the consider- able increase in complexity of these \"drawings\" last summer, I would like to suggest a new term be used to refer to them. In analogy to the term petroglyphs, which are pictures carv- ed in rock, I suggest the term agriglyphs, for pictures that are \"carved\" in agricultural lands and crops. — Bruce Maccabee LOOKING BACK, Continued reaction that kept us from going into the ditch,\" Mrs. Morales said.

With binoculars or a telescope, carefully examine the dim patch in Cancer the Crab (on the meridian). It is a V-shaped cluster of several hundred stars called the Beehive located at a distance of nearly 600 light years. On the opposite side of Leo is a much larger and more scattered wedge of stars visible with the naked eye - Coma Berenices (Berenice's Hair). Binoculars reveal 20 to 30 stars. This nearby cluster is 300 light years distant. In the same direction, but far beyond this wedge of stars, lies a cluster of more than 1,000 galaxies — spiral assemblages of billions of stars similar to our own Milky Way. Some of these galaxies can be viewed through small telescopes. The Coma galactic cluster is centered some 400 million light years away. In eastern North America on March 20, the crescent Moon occults stars of the Pleiades cluster between about 6 and 8 p.m. (EST). GULF BREEZE, Continued Given this firm documentation, anyone wishing to contend that Ed Walters himself constructed the UFO model must locate another home on or at the corner of Jamestown Drive - built by Ed in that period - with a living area and outer slab of exactly the same dimensions. It should be mentioned here that Gulf Breeze Mayor Ed Gray, in trying to pin the model on Ed Walters, is said to have analyzed every blueprint he ever submitted, but was unable to find a home with the \"1740\" and \"2393\" notations. Thus, this subplot of the Walters' ex- periences can be put to rest. The only logical conclusion is that someone crimped the water pipe leading from the refrigerator in the Walters' home after they moved out, then planted the model along the pipe in the attic in the hope that the new owner would find and report it. Was the \"someone\" a UFO skeptic, a UFO investigator out to em- barrass MUFON, or perhaps the military intelligence establishment? Perhaps we'll never know. Never- theless, this issue is declared dead. PARANOID, Continued investigation by associating it in the public mind with irrational paranoid rant. That kind of person may also be on the government payroll, acting as a disinformation agent. After all, we've heard this kind of destructive \"inside information\" before. Who can forget the nose-dive our col- lective credibility took when a TV pro- gram broadcast tales of captured aliens sitting around all day listening to classical music and guzzling strawberry ice cream? Hulk Hogan's near death ex- perience and Cooper's mass murderers and Rabbi/Doctor Bronner's Wilkie assassination scenario may be fun for some, but for the rest of us the paranoid temptation must be resisted if truth is ever to be given a chance. For God's sake, let's use our common sense. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued Gerald A. Zimmerman, M.A. in Library Science; and Jan Churchill, M.A. in International Affairs. Jacques Poulet (St. Placide, Quebec) volunteered as a translator for French and Karl H. Alderhold (Frankfurt, Germany) for German. 1991 Symposium The theme for the MUFON 1991 In- ternational UFO Symposium to be held July 5, 6 and 7 at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare Hotel at O'Hare International Airport near Chicago is \"UFOs: The Big Picture,\" hosted by Tom Stults and Illinois MUFON. Confirmed speakers will be John H. Altshuler, M.D. and Linda Moulton Howe, Cattle Mutila- tions; Zechariah Sitchin, Genesis Revisited; Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., UFO Photo Analysis; Stanton T. Friedman, Roswell Case Up-Date; Michael D. Swords, Ph.D., Modern Biology, Close Encounters and the ETH; Gene M. Phillips, Ancient Astronauts; C.B. Scott Jones, Ph.D.; David M. Jacobs, Ph.D., Abduction Research; John S. Carpenter, M.S.W., Clinical Hypnotherapy; Michael Chorost and Dennis Stacy, English Crop Circles; and Prof. Jean-Pierre Petit, Director of Research, CNRS (France). A contract has been signed with American Airlines to be the official car- rier for the symposium, which also in- cludes American Eagle flights to Chicago from the contiguous 48 states, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Special rates at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare Hotel have been contracted at $68 per night for single or double oc- cupancy, triple occupancy $78 or four people at $88. Hotel reservations may be made by calling (708) 696-1234 and advising the desk that you are attending the MUFON 1991 UFO Symposium. The auditorium will seat 1500 people. Ad- mission ticket prices will be announc- ed in the near future. Change of Address Notification In the highly mobile society in which we live, many people fail to notify MUFON when they move via a Post Office Change of Address card or a note. Their copy of the Journal is destroyed by the post office department and MUFON is notified of the new ad- dress by form 3579 (costs 35 C ). MUFON cannot be held responsible for non-delivery in such cases. On rare occasions the postal service in the U.S.A. and foreign countries will lose a subscriber's copy which is beyond the control of MUFON. If non- delivery may be attributed to an error in our office, the replacement copy will be provided. Our office staff needs your help to deliver 3,000 copies of the Jour- nal each month to our readers world- wide. Payments in U.S. Funds Another serious problem that our members/subscribers in foreign coun- tries can help us with is in the payment for subscriptions, proceedings, etc. All foreign purchases must be made by In- ternational Postal Money Order, cash in U.S. dollars, or a check made payable by a U.S. Bank with the elec- tronic routing codes at the bottom of the check. To process the collection of a foreign check that does not meet this stipulation costs MUFON $20. Ob- viously, we cannot honor an improper check for $30 when the bank collection charges amount to $20. We will be forc- ed to return the check for a satisfactory arrangement for payment before the order may be processed. It is suggested that cash be sent by registered mail if the above conditions cannot be met. Preliminary List of State Newsletters for 1991 Arkansas Arkansas MUFON Newsletter Edward F.

Many medical doctors in diversified specialties have volun- teered their expertise to study and recommend approaches to helping peo- ple who have been injured by close en- counters and to determine the causes. With large numbers of abductees emerging, related to UFO experiences nationwide, it is imperative that MUFON be prepared to assist these people through the traumatic ex- periences that have disrupted their per- sonal and family lives. Our primary responsibility is to provide professional help to the victims. Unraveling the story behind the percipient's event and associated research must be treated as secondary in importance. After an extensive search throughout the ranks of MUFON's professional people in the clinical therapy field, we are proud to announce that Laura Jane Boyle, M.D., a psychiatrist in Dallas, Texas, has accepted the Executive Com- mittee's invitation to become Coor- dinator for Abductions. Dr. Boyle will be supplied with copies of all member applications (Consultants and Research Specialists) wherein their professional experience and education is in one of the following fields: psychiatry, psychology, sociology, clinical therapy and hypnotherapy. With this informa- tion, she will compose a list by states and provinces so a ready referral list is available within MUFON. In another equally important medical field, John F. Schuessler, M.S.. MUFON Deputy Director for Ad- ministration and Aerospace Consultant, will be working directly with our medical doctors as related above. John will also be provided with the member- ship applications of all medical doctors who are already consultants. MUFON has been remiss in failing to utilize the immense talent that exists within this group in a positive and constructive manner. With Mr. Schuessler's coor- dination and the enthusiastic assistance of our medical doctors, virgin territory will be explored in UFO research. Animal Mutilations Without a doubt, the foremost re- searcher in animal mutilations today is Linda Moulton Howe, residing in Huntingdon Valley. Pennsylvania. A speaker at several MUFON UFO sym- posia, Linda has agreed to join the MUFON Staff as Staff Specialist in Animal Mutilations, replacing Thomas R. Adams, who has faithfully per- formed in this capacity for many years. As a pioneer in cattle mutilations, Mr. Adams has assisted Ms. Howe on many cases, which is very much appreciated. We are confident that Tom will keep abreast of the animal mutilation phenomenon as he has since the \"Snip- py the Horse\" event in Colorado. State Newsletters With the growing trend in publishing MUFON State Newsletters and the ex- change arrangement between states, it has been recommended that the Jour- nal publish a list of the editors and ad- dresses who desire to share their publication with other states. Due to printing and postage costs this exchange must be limited to one issue per state. A partial list has been published in this issue of the Journal in a separate col- umn. We have only listed the newslet- ters that have been mailed to MUFON headquarters. The list will be expanded and revised as State Directors request. Each State Director, who has initiated a state newsletter, is to be commended for this personalized communication medium to his/her members statewide. New Officers Mark E. Blashak, Virginia State Director, appointed Barbara . Flick (Charlottesville) to be his Assistant State Director. Desmond H. Bragg, Ph.D. (Des Moines. I A) has vol- unteered to become Assistant State Director to Donald A. Curtis for Iowa. Diana DeSimone was elected State Director for Massachusetts to replace Edward A. Sanborn (Chelmford) who became State Section Director for Essex County. Ms. DeSimone appointed the following new State Section Directors: Ann H. Wilson (Greenfield) for Franklin County; Joseph P. Cambria (Wakefield) for Middlesex County; and Bill Goffrier (Allston) for Suffolk County. New State Section Directors selected this past month were Walter F. Thompson (Check, VA) for Floyd, Patrick, Pulaski, Montgomery, Frank- lin and Roanoke Counties; Victoria Lacas (Fleetwood, NY) for Westchester County; Barbara W. Sowell (Boyd, TX) for Wise and Jack Counties; Michael Ray Downey (Portland, OR) for Multnomah County; Jeanne Robinson and Vincent Serencko (For- syth, MO) Co-State Section Directors for Taney, Stone and Ozark Counties; and Stephen Young (Metairie, LA) was assigned the additional counties of Orleans, Plaquemines and St. Bernard. Dennis W. Hauck, Ph.D. (Sacra- mento, CA) former editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, is also a Con- sultant in Mathematics. Three new Research Specialists are William A. Gillaspie, M.S.W. in Hypnotherapy; Continued on page 23 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 274 February 1991"}]
