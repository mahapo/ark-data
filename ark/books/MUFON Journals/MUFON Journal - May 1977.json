As Editor of this newsstand magazine* I have sought to disi- seminate auth- enticated UFO material to a public almost too eager for information on this subject. It is this same indescrim- inate eagerness that has prompted the publisher to present a most sensational and totally false case on the cover of the July issue* I hope that my resignation and exposure of this fake will insure that it does not enter the liter- ature of ufology.

On the evening of Wednesday. December 11, 1974, I was typing some material in my private room. This work lasted more than usual, til after midnight. At on time, I heard my dog barking in the back court of the house. I went out of the house and at first I didn't observed any- thing strange. I untied the dog but I don't remember which way he went or if he barked on. I turned to home when I observed my shadow was intensely casted and very well out- lined of a strong light on the white wall. I turned to the hills situated beyond the Teleojen River at ap- proximately one kilometer distance. I saw at that time a dazzling white light like a light of a soldering ap- paratus. It was much brighter and had no definite outline. It was hard to look directly at it. The light was plulsating rhythmically and was lighting very well the surroundings. I went into the house and I took up the camera and I went outside (I looked at my watch: it was twenty-two past one) and I took 8 photographs. The light was in a continous slow vertical motion ascending 10-12 seconds and descending 10-12 seconds. At the time when the brightness was max- imum the sky, the hills and the woods were lit for several kilometers. When the brightness was minimum the light seem like a head-light at a r* -, jt 1 * 7 *,•!-„\"-'' - * The first photograph of the object (left) and an enlargement (right). distance. The period between two pulsations was 1-2 seconds. The light estinguished slow after a last ascen- sion which was longer than the anterior. No sound was heard during the whole sighting which lasted 12 minutes until 1:34 a.m. The lumin- ous object did not reappear. There were no physical effects to the witness other than the normal trauma in such a case. Apparent size was 6 cm. and one kilometer away. Elevation angle between 32 degrees and 35 degrees. Astronomic azimuth with the origin in South direction was 240 degrees. Nobody from my family or friends knew about this event for it happened very late. After development of the film it was found eith emptiness ' frames. Each negative frame pre- sented a small black point of various forms. One month later I informed Ion Hobana, an old UFO investigator, writer, and publicist from Romania, of my observation. He has had many experiences with \"flying saucers\" and knew of many cases from around the world. He was very surprised at my photographs for they resem- bled the following cases: (1) Sauterrain (Creuse)-France September 2,3, 1968. (2) Faymonville (Liege)-July 19, 1972. (3) Okinawa-Sept. 22.1972. (4) Nagai-Japan July 9, 1973. Soon after that the negative was examined in a photogrammetry and Teledetection Laboratory from Bucharest by two engineers: Dan Riadulescu and Dan Mihailescu.

UFO GROUPS SEEK COOPERATION By Richard Hall, MUFON International Coordinator UFO groups around the world have been increasingly contacting MUFON seeking cooperation and information exchange. We regret that close cooperation is not always possible due to the large numer of such requests and the lack of a full-time MUFON staff. MUFON Information Centers are asked to supply informa- tion to these groups where possible, and MUFON members in the U.S. may wish to correspond. Recent inquirers have included CNIFAA (Comitato Nazionale Independente per lo Studio dei Finomeni Aerei Anomali), Mr. Francesco Izzo, via Rizzofi, 4 sc/B, 40125 Bologna, Italy; the Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team, Mr. David L.

Georges Henri, 299, B. 1200 Bruxelles, Belgium. Mr. Izzo, in Italy, is a biochemist who has been supplying CE-III cases to Dave Webb of the MUFON Humanoid Study Group, and CNIFAA is a scientifically oriented group with a planned journal entitled \"UFO Phenomena.\" Jerzy Wielunski reports surprising developments in Poland, including serious TV programs and articles, and a scientific conference on extra- terrestrial life and UFOs in Wroclaw during April, 1977. Polish news- papers have also reported news of Soviet UFO investigation, and Presi- dent Carter's statements on UFOs. c"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"r. Why These Abductions? Found in the October 1976 issue of The MUFON UFO Journal are two ar- ticles dealing with abduction by presumed extraterrestrials (\"New French Abduction Case\" translated by Rex Mibane and \"New Time Lapse Case From England Uncovered\" based on the investigations of Eric Richards and Sean Ainscough). In both instances, the unknown craft deliberately approached the witnes- ses. In the French case, the witness, Helen Giuliana, was driving along when her car failed. She covered her eyes with her hands and \"After a few moments, Miss G. looked again: the light had disappeared. Distracted she started up again to drive home.\" In the case from England, the witness, Mr. Lancashire, was on guard duty two miles from Newbiggin-on-Sea when he detected the presence of a strange light. \"Suddenly, Mr ; Lan- cashire felt impelled to go outside and another light shone out a yard or so in front of him a little above his head. Startled, he threw up his arms and felt himself drawn towards it.\" In both instances, which are part of a growing number of such cases, the witnesses had a period of time that was unaccounted for. Both join the ranks of encounters which form a definite pattern that begins with usually one (sometimes there are more) person in a relatively isolated region. A strange light or object is sighted. The witness is frightened and tries to flee or hide from what is happening. His or her next recol- lection is that of continuing with whatever he or she had been engaged in prior to the sighting. Eventually, professional help is sought which reveals a strong indication of contact with extraterrestrials. In Miss Giuliana's case (1976), she was concerned about the missing two hours and immediately sought help. A hypnotic session revealed that she had been taken onboard a craft by \"two dwarfs\". She is ostensibly examined and then released. In Mr. Lancashire's case (1942), nearly 25 years elapsed before ' 'he experienced a series of incidents, some of which could well have a psychic origin, which were in part responsible for triggering off his memory concerning the details of his 1942 contact.\" It is to be noted that the 1960's and '70's have brought to our attention reports of people being taken onboard unusual craft, being examined, having involved contact with those of other worlds, being told to forget what hap- pened, and then curiously recalling the events at a later time. (Other celebrated encounters of this nature are those of Betty and Barney Hill (1961), Patrolman Schirmer (1967), and Dionisio Llanca (1973). Indica- tions are that recollection of the speci- fic events is a direct result of: (1) the individual's memory being triggered by an event, or events, in his or her daily life; (2) the individual's memory being triggered by the entities at their discretion via unusual dreams, for instance; and (3) the assumption by these beings that humans will event- ually acquire the knowledge to obtain the information that has been planted in the witness's mind. If, as is indicated, this planet is under alien scrutiny, then the meaning of such encounters must be found. Theorizing, the existence of a group of highly evolved societies planning open contact with the world's pop- ulation when the time is deemed proper brings everything into focus. The current worldwide situation being what it is, they cannot openly approach us. A more circuitous means must therefore be found whereby they can demonstrate both their existence and intent. Hence, individuals in relatively isolated areas are located, compelled to board the craft, and released. Locked in thier minds i§ data on these visitors. Recollection occurs via one of the three methods indicated above and the data is acquired. In Encounters With UFO Occupants by Jim and Coral Lorenzen is found an indication (page 283) that when these beings prod the witness to remember, they then mon- itor him as he communicates his experience to others, When the increased interest in the fairly recent instances of purposeful abduction is noted by these visitors, it is realized that at least some humans are taking a positive interest in these unusual events. Thus, earlier \"contactees\" such as Mr. Lancashire can then be prodded into recalling the events that transpired. Years ago, the action of extra- terrestrial intelligence, expecially as regards the ability to voyage from one stellar system to another, was im- (Continued on page 9)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Humanoid Seen Near Lancashire, England (from NUFON News, May 1976) By Jenny Randies 23SunningdaleDr. Irlam, M3O6NJ, England Higher Fold is a housing estate just east of Leigh. It is only a mile or so from Mossley Common (see report 7463) and is in a NCB mining area. The OS REF is Sheet 101: 676008. The witness is a Mrs. Kent. To deal briefly with first sighting (in early March). She was waiting with a male companion at a bus stop waiting to go to work when she saw an orange ball which was dull and very large ('as large as a room'). It was contin- ually descending a little way and then pulling up sharply. The time was 06.40 and the ball was still visible as they boarded the bus. It was over in the direction of Lilford Park (which is to the north northwest). At 06.15 on May llth she went round to her daughters, who lives nearby, to take a pair of tights. As she reached the main road she saw a figure standing on a small hill. He was standing perfectly still, like a manniken, and looking out over the estate. His arms were hanging down by his side. He was completely dresssed in silver with what appeared to be a cloak, a pointed hat and lapels which pointed sharply up- wards. Tops of boots were also vis- ible. She was not able to see the features of his face. To his side, on the right, was a sphere of the same silvery colour. It was perfectly smooth and the glare was similar to polished metal reflecting sunlight. There was white light beaming down from its underside to the road below. Mrs. Kent took the tights round to her daughter and on return at 06.20 the figure was still there, still stand- ing stupidly. She became somewhat frightened now and returned home by a different route so that he could not see where she was going and try to follow her. When she returned at 06.40 to go to work the figure and the sphere had vanished. The hill in question is a man made one, which used to be a slag heap. It has been grassed over, and sports trees and abundant grass. Indeed when investigators heard of the story and looked at the spot the grass had recently been cut. Consequently it was difficult to tell if any traces were left. However, a semi-circle of twelve foot diameter was found cut into the grass. It seems most prob- able that this was caused by the machine which actually cut the grass. The sphere itself was described as only coming about half way up the figure, but it is possible that the reason for this was topographical in that the sphere could actually have been further back on the hill and in reality much larger than it appears. In circumstances such as this case one should also have to consider the practicality of a hoax perpetrated by someone on Mrs. Kent. Since the figure looked like a minniken—could it have been one? A final point of interest is to note that it was Lilford Park where Barry Yates took his second series of photo- graphs (see Report 7619 April issue). The two dates when he obtained these pictures of the mysterious patches of light were in late February and early March. Unfortunately, Mrs. Kent is not able to cooberate the exact date when the orange ball appeared, but it is interesting that this small area should produce all these intriguing cases in so short a period of time. The first encounter is claimed to have bcc'ured in about 1974 when a tall being (about 6'6\" to 7') dressed in a white one piece suit with a high collar came to him as he was lying in bed. He says that he felt a feeling of intense joy. The being just said an hello and vanished. There was a second similar meeting at an unre- membered date, when the visitor stayed longer. In approximately February 1976 the being returned again, this time with a colleague .who was similarly dressed but a few inches smaller. Both had longer and larger faces than ours, with ashen grey colouring. Long and thin lips, with a long nose. Their eyes were narrow with pupils like those of a cat. They had only four digits on each hand.  -j"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"BALL OPEN LAND MAP OF AREA TOP OF HILL The same feeling of warmth rad- iated from them, but there appeared to be something troubling them. On asking he was shpwn a piece of U tubing six inches long by V* inch wide. L said that he thought it should be easy to repair as it was only plastic hose. The beings then asked if he would like to see their craft. He affirmed this and was asked to lie flat on the bed with toes pointing up and forwards. Legs together and arms crossed over chest. The tall being knelt by the left side of the bed and said that L must relax as he would not be able to move after a few seconds. L felt a tingling all over and found it was true. He could not move. The he felt himself floating up off the bed into space. He felt as if his body were on the bed still. After a few seconds he was under the craft, described as an inverted bathtub surrounded by a golden glow like a flourescent tube which does not strike properly. Then he entered 8 into the craft through the middle underside. The next thing he recalls is being on a table in a large room. He felt in an anaethatised state. There were eight more beings in pairs around him and a big eye like structure, coloured red/purple seemed to be examining him. This is the period that is vague, and the witness almost strained to recall it. He feels hypno- sis might help restore it. He recalls asking several questions—such as who they were, why they were here and why pick on him. The only one he remembers an answer to is: Who was the alpha and omega in the Bible. (L appears to be a religious man). The answer was something like 'An insignificant being such as a worm should not ask such questions. A thousand of your years are but a day to us'. L now found himself back on his bed with his two friends by his side. They told him he would not be able to move. The pins and needle sensation returned. They said good- bye and vanished in the twinkling of an eye. Five minutes later the sensa- tion gradually wore off and L was able to move. He has had no more contact. L claims to be experiencing certain physical after-effects. He has a pain at the base of his skull, behind his right ear and in his abdomen. He also has hot flushes. In response to a question as to how he felt in the craft he said he was terribly fright- , ened and wanted to go home but in- stead said 'I want to stay'. The opinion of the psychiatrist is that L is suffering from hypnogogic halucinations, which means that the experiences were purely subjective. He bases this partly on the testimony of L's wife who was present during some of the events. This is not yet a firm conclusion, being somewhat dependant on viewing the medical records concerning the physical"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"effects. L has no known psychiatric history. Consequently investigation has ceased, at least for the time being and any further reports will be ap- pended in future issues. Even if this case is subjective it is MOST IMPORTANT to consider it carefully. It has many attributes familiar to other contact experiences. One might be tempted to wonder are all such cases halucinatory or does the ufo phenomenon have a means of controlling its percipients to the point of inducing semi-halucinatory experiences. Perhaps if one views all contact cases in the light of this last possibility we might have an explanation for the irrationalities often found in them. Finally (but by no means least) we come to the event which caused a real stir of publicity. This is the Rich- ardson case—and it began with a bang—laterally. On December 31 Mrs. Nellie Richardson, aged 65, was in her bed at Bignall End (OS SJ 809- 521) (Report 76/124). This overlooks the Cheshire plain to the north, towards Crewe 12 miles away. At approximately 02.42 she was awoken by a loud bang. (This was later con- firmed by the next door neighbour, who saw nothing because her room faces, the wrong way). Mrs. Richard- son saw a brilliant glow flooding into her room. It was caused by a huge oval object outside her window. Elevation was 10 degrees, bearing 290 degrees. The size (confirmed at interview twelve hours after the event) was that of a 9\"dinner plate at 10' distance! At first she was very frightened, but as she calmed it be- came clear that the object was not moving. Hei alarm clock had appar- antly stopped so she went downstairs to find the time.' On setting her clock right she returned upstairs and found the object still there and filling a quarter of the window, being larger than the full moon. It had moved slightly, and as she watched it moved towards her and darkened to an orange colour. It was observed for !'/< hours at least! During this time it moved only to bearing 320 degrees. It also moved further away, and at this point two small figures were seen Silhouetted against the bright object. They were like 'toy soldiers' moving to and fro. They disappeared and the object continued to move away. At this point her son John aged 31, returned from a restur- aunt. He ran upstairs to his dis- traught mother and explained that he had seen a big orange ball over the plain. It was still in view through the window and he watched it until 04.15, moving into the distance. One other point to note is that their cat (which is normally NEVER disturbed during the night) was on the window ledge downstairs staring at the object. In the follow through no ex- planation was found. The moon was discounted as a source, having set before the sighting. This was con- firmed on BBC TV when Dr. Ron Maddison of Keele University dis- cussed the case with Derek James of UFORA. Manchester Airport and Cheshire Police had no suggestions. NUFON thanks UFORA, especially Derek James, Chris Boyrne and Tony Pace, for the extensive documenta- tion supplied. This is filed under the references quoted.

But, today an increasing number of people are ser- iously studying such reports with a view towards determining their authenticity. As knowledge is ob- tained regarding these visitors, and as this data is provided to an increas- ing number of intellectually curious people, so each side learns more about the other and we prepare ourselves for the day when it is possible for these visitors to land openly and invite us to join their ranks.

By Ann Druffel Part in To those readers who might feel •that this writer's preoccupation with the Glendale helicopter case of February 1, 1977 is like beating a dead horse, I offer apologies to both the readers and the dead horse. In UFO research, however, the essence of which is comprised of weird events, there occasionally occurs a super-weird incident that simply cannot be filed away^ These occasional events worry research- ers. They invite more study, and still more study, and any correlation which can possibly be made must be regarded as a clue for eventual solution. (1) We gratefully leave behind the \"mimicking\" speculation on this case and proceed to what is perhaps the most interesting aspect sur- rounding the report. I refer to the fact that the cylindrical-shaped object which maneuvered in a pre- cise orbiting pattern with a heli- copter while being viewed from a distance of 300-500 feet by two professional and highly sceptical observers over Glendale, Califor- nia was distinctly similar to a well known Brazilian UFO, which was involved in one of the strangest abduction stories ever recorded. (20 On the afternoon of May 4th, 1969 (Sunday), Jose Antonio da Silva was fishing alone on the banks of a small lagoon at Bebedouro, in the muniple district of Matozinhos, Brazil. Jose Antonio was an en- listed soldier and orderly to the Deputy-Commandant of a Guards Battaliion of the Military Police Force in Minas Gerais. About 3:00 p.m. on the above date, he became aware of figures moving behind him, and without warning was over- 10 come by cramps and numbness in his legs. He was seized by two short entities dressed in shining \"suits\" and dull-gray helmt-like masks. The entities were soon joined by a third, and Jose Antonio was carried some distance to a \"machine\", which was standing on a small dirt road. The machine \"consisted of a ver- tical cylinder joined at the bases to two lenticular or flattened pieces, both of them having a diameter greater than that of the cylinder. From the edges of the upper plat- form, at regular intervals, ran rods which were set obliquely into the base of the cylinder. In the cylinder was an opening resembling a door, some 1.30x0.60 metres in size. The external height of the machine was about two metres, the upper platform being about three metres in diameter and the lower platform, which rested on the ground, being some 2.5 metres in diameter. The cylinder wasof a grey colour, and the two platforms were black.\" To make a fascinating story very short, Jose Antonio was taken aborad the machine, the inside of which was quadrangular, each side bieng about 2 metres long and the height about the same. This exact description is quoted from the FSR Bebedouro article to point up the similarities with the Glendale object. The color and reported height and width were similar. (3) Especially the obliquely slanted appendages, which were termed \"rods\" in the Bebedouro article and \"struts\" by the Glendale witnesses are so much the same in angle of slant, width and length in proportion the cylinder as to be truly fascinating. The best way to view these similarities is to compare the two sketches accompanying this article. Sketch A is an artist's impression based on the description given him by Jose Antonio. Sketch B is a composite of the two sketches made by the Glendale helicopter witnesses. It needs to be explained here that in the February 1977 MUFON UFO JOURNAL article, the second witness' sketch was printed upside down by mistake 1 In sketch B accompanying this pre- sent article, the entire composite sketch is printed upside down, for it is in this way that the correla- tion with the bebedourd object is most marked. Even the faint markings seen by one of the Glen- dale witnesses corresponds with the heights and position of the door described by Jose Antonio. But is it fair, you might ask, to print a UFO sketch upside down to show correlation with another? In this case it is more than fair for the following reason. Continuing the Bebedouro story, the object with its three short entities and its unwilling passenger lifted off the ground and traveled for what seemed to Jose Antonio an \"interminable\" time. At about mid-point during the r journey, \"the machine seemed to rotate on its lateral axis. To illustrate this manoeuvre Jose Antonio took a tumbler, to represent the central cylinder of the machine, and laid it on its side. The seats adjusted themselves to this new position of the machine, 'and seemed to have swung over themselves*. Then, after another lengthy period, the machine and the seats reverted"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"to the normal poistions\". So when we print our composite sketch of the Glendale object upside down, we are doing nothing different than the Bebedouro object was apparently able to do. (4) The remainder of the Bebedouro report is not of special correlative value as regards the Glendale sighting, though the entire FSR article is heartily recommended to any student of UFOs for its sheer vivacity and degree of strangeness. Our purpose has been served here by pointing up the distinct similar- ities between the two objects', configurations. The fact that the Bebedouro object had linticular or flattened platforms on top and bottom need not detract from our correlative study. It is possible that these were actually present on the Glendale object also, but unseen by the two witnesses. The top platform if actually existent, could have been shrouded in shadow, since the object's bottom light reflected up only about two-thirds of the cylin- der's height. The lower platform, if actually existent, could have been hidden behind the extremely bright bottom light. However, another possible correlative factor cannot be ignored. It may be of no importance what- ever, or again it may be of tremen- dous value. Jose Antonio was a Brazilian soldier, and he was in- formed by his abductors, by means of laborious sign language, that they wished to make use of his military and police knowledge to get samples of human weaponry and other information about the earth for them. If we consider the fact that the Glendale object encountered and maneuvered with a helicopter—a sophisticated earth machine—with two professional observers inside, we might be permitted to wonder. If the Glendale object was an actual UFO—and not a mistaken Hoax balloon!—was it seeking another Jose Antonio to abduct? Or had its occupants—if any—decided to gather their own information regarding earth weaponry and resources? The Glendale witnesses, when shown the Bebedouro FSR sketch, were impressed with its likeness to what they had seen themselves. But they remain completely una- ware of any reason for their en- counter. There is no evidence that any \"message\"—telepathic or otherwise—was relayed to them, and of course the 4-5 minute duration of sighting does not permit us to consider any possibility of physical abduction. In fact, the names and occupation of the two Glendale observers were released by mistake in the February 1977 MUFON UFO JOURNAL and are not to be used in any furhter research studies.(5) It is a sad note for ufology that the United States, superior as it is in educational advantages and technology, lags far behind Brazil in it public and officail acceptance of the UFO phenomena. As a footnote to end this study of the Glendale helicopter sighting of February 1, 1977 it might be of interest to include a short summary of the mini-flap which coincided with it. For an entire month after the helicopter incident was phoned into SKYNET—MUFON on Feb- ruary 2, 1977, residents of Glendale and surrounding communities reported a large number of un- explained objects. There were twenty cases investigated, covering sightings dates from July 4th, 1976 through March 6, 1977 from a relatively tiny area, approximately 11 x 11 miles square. (6) These cases indicate a local flap of sizable proportions. Of the reports, one was a CE-III with landing, another a possible CE-III. The helicopter encounter is regarded as a CE-I. At least 7 other reports were puzzling NL's of possible scientific value, particularly one situation involving a recurring light which might permit future instrumented study. Five were probable hoax balloons of an unknown type, and another was identified as Venus. The remaining five reports fall into the never-never land between possible UFO and possible IFO. The flap ended with a rousing landing report, classified CE-II, which is still being investigated and holds considerable promise of scientific value. considering the fact that in this writer's experience, at least, only 2-3 percent of ordinary raw data reports turn out to have scientific value, the close encounter cases from this localized flap alone, constitute a 15 percent unexplained, and this figure does not even con- sider the three or four other NL's which may yet yeild pay dirt. The mini-flap, however, was not altogether a pleasant research experience. It yielded fascinating data, intelligent witnesses, and an astonishing degree of public interest and cooperation. But it also pointed up the abysmal state in which present-day ufology finds itself. The CE-IH case, for instance, lay hidden for eight months, simply because the witness did not know where to report it. There were alleged physical traces associated with this report which were no longer visible by the time MUFON 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Composite . of two sketches made by witnesses to helicopter sighting, Glendale, California.

On the night of Tuesday July 16, we sighted a UFO. The place was Indianapolis, Indiana. The time was about 11 pm. The details are as follows: My friend's name was Danny Bently. He was also English, and was a philoso- phy student on vacation. I first came to the USA in 1965, and have a B.S. degree in physics. We were driving initially from Boston to Dallas in a Chevrolet Impala which we were delivering for a drive-away company. We left Boston on Monday, and spent the first night beyond Buffalo, NY. We were sleeping in the car to save money. On the second night we reached the western outskirts of the city of Indianapolis (just beyond a bus depot). We were on the route west towards St. Louis. On the right hand side I saw a large empty field. It seemed a good place to stop for the night. I drove into the field through an open gate, and proceeded to the center of the field—about 150 yards from the highway. I did not want any police cars to see us drive into the field, so I switched-off the lights. However, as I drove across the field I flashed them for a mere instant every 15 yards or so, just to make sure we were not about to drive into any obstructions. When we reached the center of the field I turned the car round to face the highway. We pro- ceeded to get ready to go to sleep. However we noticed a light in the field. At first we thought it was somebody walking towards us hold- ing a flashlight, but the light (which was white), moved rather irregularly, went off at times, and then re-ap- peared elsewhere—perhaps 15 yards away. It wandered around and then disappered again, and so on. This type of behavior continued for about 5 minutes. At nearest approach it was only about 20 yards away. At farthest approach it was towards the edge of the field—perhaps 100 yards away. We were completely baffled by it, but we decided no-one else was in the field, and we were prepared to go to sleep when my friend suddenly pointed to the sky and exclaimed \"look!\" We both saw a brilliant crimson red light which appeared to be above and slightly beyond the trees on the eastern edge of the field. It was probably at a distance of be- tween 300 and 800 yards, and at a height of between 100 and 300 yards. The light was so brilliant, weird, and penetrating, that I knew right away that I had never seen anything like it before. I tried to see something metallic \"behind\" the light, but all I could see was the light. I tried to work out if it could have been a freak reflection or optical .phenomenon connected with the traffic on the highway. This was surprisingly heavy at the time, with many trucks hurtling along. However I could not see how this could be so. The light hovered in a very un- stable manner. It seemed almost to be shooting out in all directions and then reforming itself the entire time. We watched it for about 15 minutes while it wandered above the trees, and eventually disappeared. Conclusion: I presume that my flashing,of the car headlights in a rather unusual manner may have attracted the UFO initially. I assume that the light in the field was in some way projected from the UFO. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE Ro.

The April 26 ENQUIRER reported on Dr. Peter A. Sturrock's recent poll of astronomers on the UFO topic. Eighty percent of the astronomers responding to the poll favored additional scientific study of UFOs. January UFO reports from Tennessee were detailed in the May 3 issue of the ENQUIRER, while the recent California sightings were covered in an article in the May 10 issue. The May 3 issue of THE STAR contained excerpts from President Carter's UFO sighting report which was filed with NICAP in 1973. There is also a discussion of Carter's campaign promise (or perhaps we should say allege campaign promise) to reveal governmental information on UFOs. Speculation along these lines has been heightened by an item in the April 18 issue of U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT which says that UFO information (\"unsettling dis- closures\") from CIA files will be released to the public by the end of 1977. THE STAR, however, quotes Carter's science advisor, Frank Press as not being \"particularly interested in UFOs.\" Those who have followed the UFO subject over the years will recognize all this as the latest version of a perennial rumor that the govern- ment intends to make \"The An- nouncement\" about UFOs. Perhaps, but I remain skeptical. 14 The International UFO Registry's publication, UFOLOGY, is now avail- able in a tabloid newspaper format, being published on a biweekly basis. The April 28 issue is the first of the new style releases and is nicely done. It contains articles on cattle mutilations, additional information on Betty Hill's experiences, a feature on the UFO movie, \"Close Encounter of the Third Kind,\" psychic impres- sions of UFOs, general news notes, letters, etc. JOURNAL editor Dennis Hauck contributes a regular column and there is also an interesting rumor column by \"Smiling John.\" Wonder who he really is?

APCIC sub- scribes to a nationwide press clipping service and then reproduces the clippings for their own subscribers at the rate of $5.00 per month. This service actually consists of two separate \"issues,\" one dealing entirely with UFOs (including foreign press reports) and the other (\"Mysteries of the World\") repro- ducing items on Bigfoot, Lock Ness, the Bermuda Triangle, \"mystery animals,\" pyramids, etc. The April issues, for instance, contain 20 letter-sized pages of Fortean clips and 43 pages of UFO clips and news of new hardcover and paperback books. Contact APCIC at P.O. Box 9073 - Cleveland, Ohio 44137. The May issue of ARGOSY UFO features articles of interest by Wendelle C. Stevens, Robert Barrow, Richard Toronto, and others. This magazine shows improvement in the quality of their material, as the May issue is the first one which has not relied—at least in part—on reprints from older UFO books. UFO REPORT for June includes articles by Gray Barker, Peter Guttilla, Gene Steinberg, and others, along with book excerpts from Peter Tompkins' MYSTERIES OF THE MEXICAN PYRAMIDS and Charles Berlitz's new book, WITHOUT A TRACE. The June issue of FATE has Part 1 of a two-part article on some very curious UFO experiences in Alaska which are somewhat reminiscent of the Rhodesian \"teleportation\" case of a few years ago. I would have to rate the July issue of ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS as somewhat better than average, if. only because of Michael Cohen's excellent article on Mars and the pos- sibility of a civilization having existed (or still existing?) there.

He and two young friends, Dean Toth (14) and his sister Dana Toth (10) had viewed a \"glow- ing gray object\" in the west over the Chatsworth Mountains about five miles from the Toth home. Doug described the object as looking \"like a dome, or half a football\" (see sketch on MUFON sighting question- naire). He stated it in no way resem- bled any kind of cloud, but seemed to have form and substance. The object was first noticed at 9:30 p.m. Doug sent Dean into the Toth house to get a camera and binoculars while he and Dana continued to watch. The object diminished in size as though it were moving slowly away from them directly toward southwest. By the time Dean return- ed, the object had faded from sight. Duration of sighting was about two minutes. No sound was audible. Doug stated on his MUFON form that the weather was clear, with about 30 percent scattered clouds, No wind was apparent. The object seemed about the size of a half-moon, or about 1/2 degree along its horizon- tal axis. \"I knew it was something which I had never seen before. I knew right away it was some sort of alien space craft\", Doug wrote on his MUFON form.

Doug and the two other witnesses were also puzzled by the fact that five or ten minutes after reporting the 9:30 p.m. sighting to the investigator they went outside again and found that the skies in the vicinity of the sighting, and elsewhere, were perfectly clear of clouds. Where the 30 percent cloudiness had disap- peared to during the few minutes they were reporting the sighting, they could not explain. Doug stated that he has never noticed, anything like this before, but did not speculate as to the cause. Doug's written and verbal reports were quite mature for his age, in spite of his tendency to accept the object as \"an alien space craft\". He works parttime in addition to attending school, and impressed the investigator as intelligent and stable. 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"UFO LIGHT BEAM PIERCES WITNESS By Ilkka Serra, MUFON Representa- tive for Finland.   , (From UFO Research of Finland Quarterly Report, 4/76) The most interesting UFO case in 1976 discovered by the UFO Re- search of Finland took place on • November 12, 1976 at approximately 8 p.m. in the city of Oulu. Seven young men observed a bluish-yellow light in the north-western sky. After 10 to 15 minutes two lights ap- peared in the north-east. Simultaneously the youths spotted two yellow light balls in the western sky at a distance of 30 to 40 meters. The size and brightness of the object fluctuated. The balls were at an altitude of 1.5 meters and had a diameter of 1.5 meters at their largest and the most dim stage. Two boys (Eero Lammi, 19, and Seppo Moilanen, 15) approached the lights, but when they were at a dis- tance of 10 meters from the closest object they lost their courage and started to turn back. Suddenly one of the boys, Eero Lammi, noticed a bright flash of light above and before him. He felt a pain in his chest. The world became red in his eyes and then everything blacked out. The other boy saw how a bright light beam struck his friend in the chest, penetrated his body, and hit the ground about one meter behind his feet. The boy screamed with pain and lost consciousness. His muscles were totally stiffened and his pulse was slowed down to 40. His friends carried him into a hut where he came to after 5 minutes. The light balls had disappeared after the attack of the light beam. Later in the evening dozens of red spots appeared on the boy's chest above the lower ribs and a red area on his back. The color of the spots dimin- ished gradually and disappeared within a day. The boy stated that there was no reason to call a doctor. Several neighbors had observed the bluish-yellow light in the north-west, but they had not seen the light balls. The case given wide coverage in Scandinavian newspapers and periodicals.

Submitted by Mike Viljoen, MUFON Representative for South Africa) Animal reactions and a satellite object case were among the reports reviewed by the Durban Branch of Contact-S.A. in 1976. At 3:30 a.m. February 9, 1976, Leonard Roberts was awakened by the frantic sounds of the geese and horses on the Roberts' farm, near Grahamstown. Going to the window, he saw a ball of light half way up the nearby Green- hills FM radio masts. Leonard woke the rest of his family, who all saw the object before it disappeared. About 27km east of Grahamstown, on March 5, 1976, Christopher Halse was awakened at 3:15 a.m. by a commotion among the dogs on the family farm. He saw a dazzling object about 25m away, apparently hovering about 3m above his parent's home. The UFO grew brighter and dimmer at regular intervals and made a strange buzzing sound. Christopher woke his parents, and they watched the object together until about 5 a.m. when it suddenly shot off in the dis- tance and vanished. A technician and his wife from Tongaat observed a UFO off Umdloti beach, August 21, 1976. At 5:45 p.m. they saw an object (shape not stated) hovering below clouds, with groups of six smaller objects emerging from the main object accompanied by \"thump- ing\" sounds. The central UFO pulsated between orange and yellow, and then began to fade until only a cloud of smoke was left. The Durban group has also been investigating for some time the so- called \"Confederation Tapes\"—tape recordings of radio messages said by a classic contactee to be messages from spacemen who are part of a confederation of twelve planets. The preliminary investigation reports point out a number of contradictions in the claimant's story and the usual ineffectuality of the alleged spacemen, noting in one place: \"As creatures with supposedly superior intelligence who have 'studied' us (and lived among us) for centuries, they still appear to be dismally ignorant about Man and his customs and seemingly naive in their approach.\" However, the group refrains from passing final judgement on the tapes and associated claims and investigation is continuing.

John L. Warren, Ph.D., State Director for New Mexico and a Consultant in Physics, was the choice to fill a vacancy on the Blue Ribbon Panel on Unidentified Flying Objects. The Enquirer annually awards up to $10,000 for \"The Most Scientifically Valuable Evidence on UFOs\" as determined by the Blue Ribbon Panel from cases previously screened by the \"mini-panel\" composed of representatives of APRO, MUFON, NICAP and know- ledgable Enquirer staff personnel. John F.

Mr. Schuessler, a mechancial engineer, employed by McDonnell- Douglas Astronautics at the NASA Space Center in Houston, TX brings not only a vast knowledge of the UFO phenomenon, but the experience of a technical manager in the aerospace industry to bear upon this problem. Dr. Warren, on the other hand, will draw both from his educational back- ground in physics and that of his management of the research labora- tories at Los Alamos, NM operated by the University of California.

One of the 9 cases was solved and classified as the after- light of a so-called bolide. And 7 reports were classified as vague, since the amount of data they con- tained was insufficient. One case was classified as a UFO. In the Finnish media there were 35 articles or transmissions dealing with UFOs during the reporting period. On January 6, 1977 at 7 p.m. at Lapinlahti Village a disc-shaped light appeared above a Toad and directed beams of light downward. The disc hovered above the road for a few seconds and disappeared in the sky. There was one witness. On March 6, 1977 at 8 p.m. at Laihia Village a point of light slightly larger than a star appeared in the northern sky. Then came a light ball from the west and another from the east to the area. All the lights merged and the new entity remained in the sky for approx- imately 20 minutes. The phe- omenon fluctuated from one color to another and then disappeared suddenly. There was one witness.

UFO SIGHTING REPORTS BY PILOTS SOUGHT By Walt Andrus With the termination of VFON (Volunteer Flight Officer Network) on June 30, 1975, due to lack of funds, the work of Herbert E. Roth, the Director, has suffered a serious void. Members of the Volunteer Flight Officers Network throughout the years have made substantial and meaningful contributions to a variety of scientific disciplines and can take justifiable pride in this effort. It is impossible to adequate- ly acknowledge the contributions made by over 56,000 flight crew members of 120 airlines located in 54 countries. Herb Roth, in his memo to all member airlines on May 15, 1975, sincerely wished to express his gratitude to everyone for a job well done. Since Herb was a dedicated MUFON member at that time, he shared confidential UFO airline pilot reports with the Mutual UFO Network. It is imperative that we have continuous access to all pilot reports—not just those of member airlines. The later have practically diminished with the closing of VFON. The UFO phenomenon is so diverse, that specialization is required when we are working with volunteers, each with a full time occupation and limitted free time to devote to this study. Richard F. Haines, Ph.D. has selected UFO sightings by pilots of military, commercial, private, and research aircraft as his area of specialization. To date, he has over 3,000 sightings in his files. Some are quite startling and potentially important. Dr. Haines holds a major project responsibility in NASA on the west coast, so is qualified to evaluate pilot reports. It would be appreci- ated by both MUFON and Dr. Haines if members would please send duplicate copies of pilot sight- ings to MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155 and to Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., 325 Langton Avenue, Los Altos, CA 94022. UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICES Rod B.

Yes, we highly endorse this fine contribution to the UFO field. Appendix I, listing the major international UFO reserach groups, properly recog- nizes MUFON as number one from Len's viewpoint. RECAPPING AND COMMENTING By Richard Hall (MUFON International Coordinator) (Comments in this month's column are based, in part, on articles appear- ing in the January 1977 MUFON UFO JOURNAL, NO. 110) Len Stringfield's account of the January 6, 1976, Stanford, Kentucky abduction case, rightfully, dominates this issue and represents the kind of investigation desperately needed in cases of this type. Unfortunately, it also strikingly illustrates the practical problems of investigation (special skills needed, lack of time and funds) and the organizational pushing and pulling that is detrimental to objec- tive scientific investigation. Sitting comfortably in my armchair and with the benefit of hindsight, I can easily point out lines of investi- gation that ought to have been pursued. The continuing effects on clocks, and apparently on the para- keet, suggest a residual electro- magnetic field of some kind which conceivably could have been detected by appropriate instruments. The physical effects on the witnesses cry out for medical reports. And the \"mysterious psychic incidents\" mentioned in the photo caption, page 6, but not specified, need to be stated and weighed against the past psychic proclivities (or lack of them) alleged for the witnesses. Who are the witnesses, and what are their past beliefs and lifestyles? However, Len Stringfield has repeatedly demonstrated over the years that he is a sensitive, careful, open-minded investigator with the flexibility of mind appropriate— indeed, essential—for trying to cope with human witnesses who make bizarre reports. Considering the circumstances, and the lack of avail- able resources, he has given us a surprising amount of information, and food for thought. Also, his findings on the case are elaborated in his new book SITUATION RED: THE UFO SIEGE (Doubleday, 1977). Any remaining questions merely illustrate the magnitude and complixity of the problem we are trying to deal with. Welcome Addition A significant addition to the Journal staff announced in this issue is that of Paul C. Cerny, former California Bay Area NICAP Sub- committee Chairman. My old friend and colleague brings to bear many years of experience, and a demon- strated track record of building an effective investigation/information network. Paul did invaluable work for NICAP in the 1960's. The Journal has now, belatedly, entered 1977 (issue dated January received in early May) giving pro- mise that we will soon be on sch- edule. More important even then that, however, is the caliber of the information content, which seems to me—from my biased viewpoint as Associate Editor—to be extremely good over the past several issues."}]
