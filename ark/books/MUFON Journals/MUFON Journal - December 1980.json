FROM THE EDITOR The Meier hoax (no quotes necessary) is so blatant that we hope no one is fooled by this charade. Unless Meier or others who claim to be- lieve him wish to dispute the charges against him, Kal KorfPs expose should be the last word. We hope so. What's going on in China? In addition to the military pilots' case in this issue, we have a new report on sightings in China scheduled for an upcoming issue. Why does arch skeptic Phil Klass misrepresent the state of U.S. radar when he should know better? Will 1981 bring some reso- lution to the convoluted mystery of people who claim knowledge of crashed UFOs and retrieved humanoid bodies? The Fund for UFO Re- search expects to make a grant next year for an in-depth study of some abduction claimants. Will this baffling question be illuminated? And can the Fund make a difference in helping to obtain answers? Will Citizens Against UFO Secrecy force some new disclosures from the CIA? We have no shortage of interesting questions as we enter 1981. Let us pledge a renewed effort to work together and to support - as active investigators or as contributors - one or more of the worthy (and needy) organizations in the front line of the battle to obtain the un- varnished truth about UFOs. ,i C I In this issue THE MEIER INCIDENT: INFAMOUS HOAX  3 By Kal K.

Korff (©1980,KalK. Korff) According to the book UFO . . . Contact From The Pleiades, a Swiss citizen named Eduard \"Billy\" Meier has had over 130 contacts with aliens, recording over 3,000 pages of quotes from them, and has taken hundreds of clear pictures of their craft. He has al- so been given rock and metal samples which, according to his story, defy conventional explanation. The book goes on to state that an investigation conducted by Wendelle Stevens, Thomas Welch, Britt-Nilsson-Elders, and Lee Elders, has shown all of Meier's claims to be genuine. If the events described above were truly factual, it would certainly be one of the most remarkable occurrences the world has ever seen. Unfortunate- ly, as we shall discover, none of the purported events appears able to with- stand careful scientific scrutiny. According to the book, Meier's first experiences with extra-terrestrials began on January 28, 1975. However, according to articles written by Wen- delle Stevens and published in the now defunct Argosy UFO, dated March 1977 and May 1977, Meier's first sighting of a UFO occurred on June 2, 1942 while he was only five years of age. Subsequently, Meier has also claimed that during that same year, he was invited to take a ride on a pear- shaped UFO by a \"very old man .\"2 According to press releases de- signed to help promote the book's sale, Jim Lorenzen, Director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organi- zation, supposedly endorsed the book as being a genuine representation of the facts. However, he did not. This was a partial quote, taken out of con- text, as Lorenzen went on to say that he considered the Meier photographs \"art\" not science.3 Wendelle C. Stevens, a one-fourth partner in Genesis HI Productions which published the book, says Meier sought no publicity from anyone con- cerning his alleged experiences. Yet it is a documented fact that Meier in- formed Mr. Wilfried Falk of Mann- heim, West Germany, that he planned to write a book about his experiences as early as 1977.4 A1 SO; according to Jim Lorenzen, Stevens once described Meier to him as \"a sort of person who gets great satisfaction out of fooling authorities.\"5 The book alleges that some of Meier's pictures were analyzed by computer and shown to be authentic. It further goes on to imply that De Anza Systems of San Jose, California, did some of the analysis of the Meier photographs. A check with Mr. Wayne Heppler, the manager for De Anza Systems, produced a categorical denial that an analysis was ever done. \"There was no analysis perform- ed. What we did was some enhancing to make certain parts of the picture stand out.\" exclaimed Heppler. \"So your firm did not do an anal- ysis?\" \"No.\" replied Heppler. \"But the book implies that you did, and furthermore it claims that via computer analysis the Meier photo- graphs were shown to be authentic.\" I stated. \"That is garbage!\" replied Hepp- ler. \"Look, what these guys did was come down to De Anza Systems claim- ing that they wanted to buy a com- puter from us. So we took one of their pictures, one showing the UFO, and enhanced it to make certain parts of the picture stand out. Then they took pictures of it, left, and stated that they would get back in touch with us. And we haven't heard from them since,\" exclaimed Heppler. I then asked Heppler if De Anza Systems had the technical capabilities to do such an analysis, and he replied: \"No. We are in no position to do an analysis.\" Finally, I asked Heppler who the men were who had visited De Anza Systems. He told me that it was Jim Dilettoso and Thomas Welch. Heppler also said he knew of Wendelle Stevens. 6 In an as yet unpublished paper, Wendelle Stevens states that a thorough analysis of several of the Meier photos was conducted by Neil Davis of Design Technology in Poway, California. A further check with De- sign Technology brought the informa- tion that their analysis had by no means been conclusive, and that it certainly did not prove the validity of the Meier photographs.^ Another claim made in the book UFO. . .Contact From The Pleiades is that Meier once photographed a Swiss fighter attacking a UFO. Yet within the photograph itself, there is no visible evidence of this event taking place. After this was brought to their attention, Genesis III claimed that the pilot did not see the UFO, but that it had merely been tracked on radar. If this were the case, one wonders how the pilot could possibly have attacked something that he was unable to see? Also, if one relies on a strictly cursory examination of the photograph in question, it will be noted that the UFO appears to be flying too low to have been picked up on radar! The book goes on to say that there were many witnesses to the (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Hoax, continued) events described by Meier. Yet the book fails to give any statements by the witnesses, the names of the alleged witnesses, or descriptions of what the witnesses saw. Instead, what one is left with are pictures of Meier sitting in a room full of unidentified people, which in itself proves nothing. Another of Meier's interesting claims is that the aliens informed him that they originated from the star sys- tem of \"the Pleiades.\" This on it's surface is illogical, since the term \"Pleiades\" is an Earth term for that particular cluster of stars. It would be a tremendous coincidence indeed if the aliens also called their home star system by the same name. Even more damning, however, is that the Pleiades are only some tens of millions of years old, and thus still relatively unformed stars. According to astro- nomers, they are neither old enough nor stable to have formed planets capable of supporting life. In fact, their generally gaseous state can be easily viewed in the photo of these stars that appears in the book!\" It is alleged that over 3,000 pages of notes were taken by Meier during his encounters, and that the aliens gave Meier the most sought after prize of all -wisdom. If this were the case, it was very basic wisdom indeed, since all of the_ supposed quotes are of a pseudoreligious nature, while advo- cating a belief in reincarnation and pantheism. Dr. James 'Hurtak, a language specialist who has read most of Meier's writings in the original German, had this to say about them: \"As an aside, I have had the op- portunity to readjarge portions of the Semjase correspondence (some eleven volumes of German material via Meier). From the standpoint of'higher criticism' - the linguistic use of Egypt- ian-Aramaic and Egyptian-Hebrew names (of divinities) and stylistic af- finities — is 'latter day patch-work.' \"All this shifting play of corre- spondences by which everything, as it were, is cheated of its individual logic creates a mood of pensive jesting, spirited allusions, and even sublime travesty. By all standards of genuine 'ancient knowledge' (e.g. Egyptology, Semitics, etc.), this civilization which lays claim to being 5,000 years into the future has not offered much in the way of a quantum jump over what our ancestors had 5,000 years ago, (in the way of intellectual transforma- tion).\" 9 In addition, the \"Talmud Imman- uel,\" claimed by Meier to be the true New Testament hidden until recently, proved to be nothing more than Luther's version of the New Testament with added passages exhibiting the same style as the Semjase manuscript (Meier's alleged space \"source\") and contained exactly the same stylistic errors characteristic of Mr. Meier's German! 10 The book claims that Meier's camera has been jammed at just short of infinity for several years, which hampered the focus on some of the photographs. Since this appears to have been the case, and if Meier did experience over 130 contacts with aliens as claimed, then one might wonder why Meier never bothered to get his camera repaired, so that he could have taken clear sharp pictures of these \"remarkable\" events. Even more curious however is the apparent total ignorance of Stevens, Elders, Welch, et. al (who, mind you, are sup- posedly \"highly competent\" investi- gators) as to even the most basic prin- ciples of camera operation. Even pre- suming that the focus of Meier's cam- era is \"jammed just short of infinity\"; virtually any camera clerk in the coun- try knows that because of the depth of field characteristics inherent in all camera optics, (regardless of the make or model of the camera involved) a photograph of any object located be- tween five or six feet from the camera and infinity (which in camera termi- nology means anything over 50 feet away) will still be in perfect focus in any normal daylight exposure. Only objects closer then the 5 or 6 feet depth of field limit will appear fuzzy and out-of-focus, with the \"fuzziness\" increasing the nearer the object is to the camera. This fact alone would seem to be a very serious flaw in the Genesis III research, and casts serious doubt, on the possible authenticity of the Meier photos. Concerning physical evidence, the book goes on to say that the Pleiadean \"cosmonauts\" gave Meier some crys- tals which were unique, and not gener- ally known to Earth technology. In addition to these, Meier was also given four metal samples, and one biological sample. I spoke with Dr. Marcel Vogel, a scientist who conducted a series of tests on the Meier samples and whose opinion of them totally contradicts what the book claims. Marcel inform- ed me that only the first sample was unique. It consisted of aluminum, sil- ver, and thalium, with each of the three elements having a high degree of purity. The other samples were found to be ordinary crystals consisting of quartz, citrine, amethyst, and silver solder, none of which proved to be of extraterrestrial origin, and they do not substantiate the claims made in the book.11 Another independent analy- sis was conducted by Dr. Robert E. Olgilvie, a professor of metallurgy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Olgilvie's findings verified Vogel's, proving the samples to be terrestrial in origin, and not unique. 12 The last seven pages of the book gives the reader a lesson in pseudo- religious archaeology, in which the authors connect the Pyramid of Cheops, the Temple of Hathor, and the Parthenon of Greece to the Pleia- des. Also included is the Devil's Tower in Wyoming, which played a promi- nent role in the movie \"Close Encoun- ters of the Third Kind.\" While it makes for interesting reading, it has little to do with Meier and his al- leged experiences. Computer Analysis of Meier's Photographs First generation copies of ten of Meier's more popularly-known photo- graphs, three of which appear in the book, were forwarded to Ground Saucer Watch Inc., in Phoenix, Ari- zona, for computer analysis. The following modes of computer enhancement were utilized: *Edge Enhancement *Color Contouring"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"*Pixel (picture cell) Distortion Test *Digitizing It is the opinion of the entire GSW photographic staff, that \"All of the pictures were hoaxes and that they should not be considered evi- dence of an extraordinary flying craft.\" (1) Most of the analyzed photo- graphs are extremely light (insuffi- cient density) above the UFO image. This tends to mask any supportive structures above the UFO. (2) The UFO images are out-of- focus when compared to other fea- tures of comparable distances from the camera. This is indicative of the UFO being close to the camera. (3) Utilizing the camera lens size (42 mm) and the focal length of the camera, all calculations place the UFO images at distances between four and six feet (1.2 to 1 & meters). (4) Atmospheric effects on dis- tance features in the pictures is not noticeable on any of the UFO images. This indicates that the UFOs are posi- tioned at a close point to the camera. (5) Shadows on the UFOs and the foreground/background features donor correlate. (6) The three types of hoax photography utilized were: (a) A suspended model with a string; (b) The double exposure technique; (c) The double print method. For specific criticisms of Meier's photographs, let us examine each of them individually. Meier reported that the large tree in tne foreground of one picture is 156 feet (46.6 meters) from the camera. Computer analysis reveals that the UFO is in front of the tree. The branches, have been interpreted to be behind the UFO. The density (grey value) of the shadow (bottom) portion of the UFO varies appreciably from features in the tree. Measuring the angle of the sun as it strikes the trees and comparing it to the UFO, it is easy to observe the difference. There is photographic evidence to suggest usage of the double print technique. The double print technique Alleged Pleiadean spacecraft Edge enhancement showing supporting string or wire consists of two negatives, one of the UFO model and the other of an out- doors scene. Then you place both negatives in the enlarger and print the picture. The UFO model is close to the camera. Computer digitizing scan of the edges of the UFO and foreground features in another picture reveals that the UFO is in the same plane. Pixel (picture cell) displacement re- veals a smooth edge on the UFO with a uniform density, which is indicative of closeness to the camera. There is evidence above the UFO of a linear structure, representing a supportive device (i.e., string or wire). In the photograph shown with this article, one can note the obvious supportive string or wire above the UFO revealed under edge enhance- ment processing. Sizing of known features indicates a model with dimen- sions of less than eight inches (203 mm) in diameter. Also, there are dis- crepancies with regard to the shadows on the UFO. Photographic analysis of six addi- tional pictures has revealed similar serious discrepancies and evidence of fakery. Ground Saucer Watch finally concluded that: \"It is our opinion that all of the analyzed photographs are hoaxes, both crude and grandiose, and that they should not be considered evidence of an extraordinary flying craft. All of the evaluated frames can be duplicated with a basic camera and darkroom equipment. . .the incidents are an updated, 1980 version of the George Adamski claims of detailed photographs and contacteeism with space people.\" One thing that immediately be- comes noticeable is the fact that the bottom portions of the UFOs in Meier's photographs are always dark, (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Hoax, continued) as would be the case if the objects in question were small models at a fairly close distance from the camera. If the objects were of any appreciable size; say 20-30 feet in diameter, the bot- toms of the craft would not be as dark as they are. This is an obvious point, visible to the naked eye. Also note that the photograph which shows the UFO in front of the two log piles is a cropped down ver- sion of the original. Curiously, when the original uncropped photograph is examined, there is a distinct lack of a ground shadow on the hill below the object where, under normal circum- stances, one would readily expect to find one. , In one particular sequence of Meier's photographs, a UFO appears to be circling a tree. Although Gene- sis III claims that the entire sequence was taken in a period of a few seconds, a close examination of the changing cloud patterns in the background actu- ally indicates that the pictures must have been taken over a much longer period of time — far longer than the \"few seconds\" ascribed to the incident by both Meier and Genesis III. Genesis Ill's counter explanation that \"clouds change quickly in that area\" falls flat when one checks the weather report of the day in question and discovers that the winds were only blowing at 15 miles an hour.^ Further examination of this se- quence turns up evidence that the UFO penetrates the limbs of the tree, as if the UFO were resting on its branches. Even more startling, how- ever, is that when the original site was visited, there was no sign of a tree ever having been there! Based on these findings, it must be concluded that both the tree and the UFO were cleverly superimposed onto photo- graphs showing nothing but a normal cloudy day. Not only are Meier's experiences said to be continuing to this very day, but to bring the reader up-to-date on his latest experiences, Genesis III is planning the release of UFO. . .Con- tact From The Pleiades Volume II sometime in late 1980 or early 1981. In addition to the claims already mentioned, Meier has also stated that he has travelled back into time and met with Jesus Christ. Jesus, as the story goes, was so pleased with Meier, that he appointed Meier as one of his disciples. Meier, however, returned back to this day and age to avoid being crucified. Meier also claims to have visited other planets, to have travelled in time to both the past and the future, and to have taken close range photographs of the Apollo-Soyuz space capsule link- up in 1975, prehistoric pterodactyls, San Francisco sinking into the bay after a major earthquake, and even one of God's eyes. (Curiously, when asked why he didn't photograph both of God's eyes, Meier replied that it was impossible since the other eye was winking at one of his Pleiadean com- panions!). Summary and Conclusion After a careful review of all of the major purported events as stated by Genesis HI and those individuals in- volved with the Meier case, it can be conclusively shown that none of the events as claimed contain the slightest shred of evidence to support their au- thenticity. Therefore it must be stated that the Meier case gives every appear- ance of being nothing more than a grandiose and elaborate hoax. It is cer- tainly the most extravagant of all of the known contactee cases contained within the records of UFOlogy. Perhaps Wendelle Stevens in a letter to Jim Lorenzen put it best: \"As you well know, Jim, the book was never designed to present any hard facts...\" ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank the follow- ing individuals who have helped this author tremendously during the course of his investigation.

A 20-year-old pilot reported that a large elongated object flashing with green lights circled in the sky above the airplane he was flying and a few seconds thereafter, he and his plane were missing. r The second day after this case, it was on Monday 23 October 1978 we also sighted a very peculiar phenome- non. Our Force is stationed in a cer- tain airport of Kansu Province. Our Main Group crew members together with several hundred people in the airport were watching a film show in the open-field square. A few minutes after the -film show, at 20 hours and 4 minutes, the whole audience in sud- den amazement was looking at the sky and talking to each other, expressing puzzlement, surprise, and alarm. At that time, the sky was fine - - cloudless and windless - - with stars spreading over the sky. When I looked up, I saw a peculiar big object moving from eastward to westward, from about 60 degrees angle to overhead. After about 2-3 minutes, it was ob- structed by a house at 60 meters dis- tance to the west and could not be sighted any more. This object was very prominent. It had two searchlight-like white lights directed forward and another light at the back. The light beams illuminated what seemed to be smoke or cloud near the object. Its speed was not fast; it was marching ahead in a straight line. The object was huge. It occupied a visual angle of 30-35 degrees. It looked as if it had a very big object in its center, but this could not be sighted clearly. It was not a falling star, nor locusts or birds. It was sure- ly not an airplane; we are all air force fighter personnel so this can be de- finitely established. It was not very high, estimated at about 6,000 to 8,000 meters. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, something never sight- ed before. A few days later, we all were still talking about it. If we had had a camera to take a photo, it would UFOs AND U.S. RADAR By Richard Hall Is U.S. defense radar so all-encom- passing that UFOs would be definitely detected regularly, or is it less than perfect - in fact, more like Swiss cheese in its coverage - as an observer of defense matters recently reported? At the Smithsonian Institution UFO symposium in September 1980, Philip Klass (Senior Avionics Editor for Aviation Week) strongly asserted that UFOs could not be flying freely through our air spaces and go unde- tected. He used .this as an argument that UFOs do not exist except as mis- taken observations. He also argued that there are too many UFO reports for them to be spaceships, and since the U.S. government could not keep a secret for over 30 years, UFOs are a myth. Aviation Week has the reputation of being a handmaiden to the Penta- gon, which has led some people to be- lieve that Klass is an anti-UFO propa- gandist for the Defense Department. That view may be simplistic, but even assuming so, one can legitimately raise the question of Klass' accuracy and have been marvelous. Some one said: \"It was a pity. It was quite possible that it was a flying saucer.\" There- after we watched the newspaper care- fully for a report, but none appeared. Thousands of us personally sighted the same phenomenon. Washington Post, Nov. 14,1980 Chinese Panel to Study UFOs PEKING, Nov. 13 (AP) - China has set up an association to study un- identified flying objects which report- edly have been sighted in many parts of the country, the official New China News Agency Xinhua said. The agency said yesterday more than 100 UFO sightings have been reported in five provinces in south-central and east China. Some reports described the ob- jects as long, others as saucer like or as balls of brilliant light, the agency said. reliability as a reporter on other grounds. A rival publication, Defense Week (300 National Press Bldg., Washington, D.C. 20045; weekly, $500 per year) on November 10 reported a view of U.S. radar portraying it as much more fallible than the Defense Department — or Klass — would have us believe. The newsletter, whose content makes it obvious that it is not a Pentagon apologist, reported that Russian bombers had been able to fly through \". . .enormous gaps in U.S. Defense radars.\" To slip past the computer- ized Semi-Automatic Ground Envi- ronment (SAGE) radar network in the U.S. and Canada, the bombers \". . .need only to fly below about 10,000 feet.\" Similarly, the far north radar networks have floors of about 1,500-3,000 feet. The newsletter said that the Russians simply locate the gaps and fly through, \". . .as drug smugglers do routinely.\" The ease with which illegal drugs are transported through our \"infallible\" detection network from Central and South America is scandalous. As a supposed expert on aviation electronics, Klass should be aware of these weaknesses. Why then does he ignore well-known facts about radar and use the alleged lack of radar UFO sightings as an argument against UFOs at the same time that other skeptics cite the fallibility of radar to discredit reported sightings? Radar UFO sightings have been reported by the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) and by other elements of the military and civilian radar network.. No doubt Klass would argue that such reports are too few and far between to be credible. No doubt he would pooh- pooh the idea that many more such sightings have been classified under security regulations, although a num- ber of pilots and radar operators have (Continued on page 9)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"UFO SIGHTED FROM AIRCRAFT By Officer Harold R. Chandler (California Highway Patrol) On August 9,1979, at about 0900 hours, I took off from Gasquet, Calif., Airport about 17 miles east of Cres- cent City, Calif., on the north coast. My destination was Red Bluff, Calif., about 165 miles southeast. About one hour later my flight had progressed to a point about 120 miles southeast and about 8 miles southeast of Hayfork, Calif. My alti- tude was 8500 ft. mean sea level and about 4000 feet above ground level. The terrain is mountainous and rugged with deep canyons. I had just started a slow descent toward the valley to the east. My wife Janet was flying the right seat, my 8 year old son Scott was in the left rear seat, and my son Wade, age 7. was seated in the right rear. As usual dur- ing a climb or descent, I was watching for other aircraft as was my wife. I might add at this point that my wife is a licensed pilot. At about 10:00 hours my wife brought to my attention two aircraft off to my right front and be- low. She gave me an astonished look and told me to look. I crabbed the plane to the right and put the nose down. At that time about 3500 to 4000 feet below and to my front, were two disc shaped craft sort of white in color. Other than their ob- vious shape that I saw, they were fly- ing at a very high speed. The craft were flying in the canyon very low to the ground (contour flying). The hills rose up on both sides of the craft. No wings or any type of con- trol surfaces were visible. The craft were flying close together with one offset and to the left rear at 100+ feet. The craft, from the distance I saw them, were not much bigger than the craft. I was flying (1947 Piper Tri- Pacer PA-22). The wing span was about 30 feet.

A- gain, even if we assume that the case for legitimate radar UFO sightings is weak, why does KJass ignore valid rea- sons why radar sightings probably would be only sporadic that are in the published literature? As Robert M. L. Baker and others have noted, radar targets that don't conform to the profiles of known air- craft or missiles are programmed out of computer systems or ignored as ir- relevant. Such \"erratics\" or \"anoma- listic targets\" are not systematically studied, at least as far as is publicly known. Our radar surveillance and tracking systems, Baker says, \". . . are even more restrictive and thus, even less likely to provide information on anomalistic phenomena than are as- tronomical sensors.\" (\"Symposium on Unidentified Flying Objects,\" Hear- ings, House Committee on Science and Astronautics, July 29, 1968). In The UFO Handbook (Double- day, 1979), Allan Hendry also reviews the capabilities of radar networks, in- cluding NORAD (p. 230), and supplies a number of reasons why military ra- dar as presently configured is far from an infallible detector of UFOs, if they exist as solid objects flying through our air spaces. Thus, research by Defense Week, Dr. Baker (astronomer-engineer), and Allan Hendry, directly contradicts the rosy view of Phil Klass that our radar would automatically detect all UFOs. To paraphase skeptic James Oberg, how does Klass \"calibrate as to his sophistication\" when he ignores highly relevant information about the specialized and restrictive uses of radar that contradict his position? And to paraphase skeptic Robert Scheaffer, \"which do we throw out?\" - Defense Department professions of infallibil- ity that reek of soothing syrup for public consumption, or apparently more objective information from re- liable sources that paint a different picture? Footnote: I have personally talked with dozens of military and civilian radar operators and pilots who have been involved in radar UFO cases, most of which were never publicly re- ported. There is no doubt in my mind that U.S. military and civilian radar has frequently tracked solid, unex- plained objects in the atmosphere per- forming in inexplicable ways. Radar obviously could be a useful scientific tool for studying UFOs if it were to be applied for that purpose. Certainly it is not infallible, but systematic scien- tific study of radar UFO reports (so far not done) could yield important information pro or con about UFOs. A RADAR CASE IN POINT One of the cases obtained in Freedom of Information Act suits is an \"Air Intelligence Information Report\" on U. S. Air Force Form 112, dated 18 March 1958, describ- ing radar-visual UFO sightings in the Panama Canal Zone by Anti-Aircraft Defense personnel on March 9-13, 1958. The 7-page intelligence report, though rich in descriptive detail, does not include technical information about the types of radar used. lack- ing that information, the case can- not be fully evaluated. However, de- fense radar did track — and observers (Continued on next page) (Aircraft, continued) flying up, over, and down the other side of the hills going northeast. In a matter of seconds after my first ob- servation, I started a time-distance check on the craft based on the hills below me. The craft started turning north toward the Trinity Alps north of Weaverville. I had them in sight for about 20 seconds and they covered an \"estimated\" distance of about 35 mfles, turning north past Weaverville. They appeared to accelerate. When they passed under me they were at about 600-700 mph and from that point on accelerated toward the moun- tains due north, and I can only esti- mate 1500 mph. It does not seem reasonable that a piloted conventional aircraft would be contour flying in and out of can- yons, low level, at that speed. I can- not rationalize a pilot reacting that fast. The craft blended in with the light-colored peaks to the north and I lost sight of them. No other aircraft was around me at the time. It was a beautiful flying day with scattered alto-cumulus clouds. My wife and my oldest son Scott saw the craft as plainly as I had. We are all in excellent health with 20/20 vision. Upon my arrival at Red Bluff Airport I checked in at the Flight Service Station. The attendant I con- tacted was not particularly interested in the sighting. I checked Notice to Airmen reports on military operations. I found a notice of low level training operations N.E. of Marysville, Calif., with T-39 aircraft north of Sacra- mento, but I know these particular aircraft and they are much slower and distinctive in appearance. What was observed was not any aircraft with which I am familiar. I made no further attempt to re- port the incident until I met Mr. Tay- lor of MUFON out of Sonora, Calif., while I was at work one day. He sug- gested that I document the incident. My occupation is California State Traffic Officer, California Highway Patrol. I have an A.A. degree, 3 years of college. I am 38 years old and have been in police work approximately 15 years. I have a commercial, instru- ment, and flight instructor's ratings, with approximately 1,000 hours flight time. I am a graduate of two police academies. My wife, Janet, has a B.S. degree. She has been a social worker and is a licensed private pilot. Editor's Note: The sighting was investigated by Paul C. Cerny with Dr. J. A. Hynek and Marvin Taylor and a MUFON report form was com- pleted on October 28, 1980. Sketches with the report indicate that Chandler described the UFO as a featureless lens-shaped 'disc, seen from various perspectives. Paul Cerny has forward- ed a copy of the report to Dr. Richard F. Haines, Bay Area physicist, for his continuing study of pilot sightings (over 3,000 reports). Dr. Haines works closely with the MUFON Bay Area group."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Radar, continued) did see — objects that have not been explained. Excerpts from the intelligence re- port follow, reported by Capt. Vernon D. Adams, USAF, Assistant Director of Intelligence, Caribbean Command AOC. The report originally bore a CONFIDENTIAL classification. During the period 9 through 13 March, three unexplainable radar contacts have been made by equipment located in the Canal Zone. On two occasions, aircraft were vectored into the area by the radar sites, with negative results. Interrogation of scope operators has indicated that returns (images on ra- dar scope - - Ed.) were strong and easily distinquished from cloud for- mations. . . Generally the tracks were triangular with speed of movement very erratic. Movement appears at times to be evasive action. The inci- dent of 9-10 March was tracked by gun laying radar. During period of observation, radar maintenance per- sonnel checked out their system thoroughly. In addition, lock was broken (electronic \"lock\" onto tracked object - - Ed.), however, the equipment immediately picked up target and lock- ed on. A second tracking radar situated on Taboga Island (Pacific Ocean side of Panama - - Ed.) locked on the return. Target generally remained in same area halfway between radar sites. Personnel stationed at sites reported seeing red and green lights. . .for only a short period. A commercial flight volunteer- ed to investigate target. He was vec- tored within a hundred yards of target and reported negative sighting. Target faded out at 0208R on 10 March. About 8 hours later another radar target west of the canal was seen for a- bout 2 hours, and a T-33 sent to inves- tigate saw nothing. On March 10 at 2003R, Capt. Harold E. Stahlman, Operations Officer, 764th Anti-Air- craft Operations Center, was notified of an unidentified object approaching from the west. It was later identified as a Chilean airliner, but at 2045R two additional radar targets were observed in the vicinity of Fort Kobbe on Search Radar, then on Track Radar at Fort Amador. The latter unit obtained a radar lock-on of two objects about 100 yards apart moving in a \"slight cir- cular path\" over Fort Kobbe at about 2,000 feet altitude. The weather was \"clear, visibility unlimited, no wind 10 reported.\" What happened next sug- gests \"typical\" UFOs: An attempt was made by members of the Radar Site, Flamenco Island, to ob- serve the objects by searchlights. When the light touched the objects, they traveled from an altitude of two thou- sand feet to ten thousand feet in five to ten seconds. This was such a rapid movement, that the Track Radar, which was locked on target, broke the Track Lock and was unable to keep up with the ascent of the ob- jects. . .no balloons were in the air at that time. To recap, two separate radar units had a fix on two apparently solid ob- jects moving in a curved path over the Canal Zone. When searchlights were shone on the objects, they were ob- served visually and (confirmed by ra- dar) one abruptly climbed 8,000 feet at a speed that computes to be better than 500 m.pJi. Earlier the same day, the Taboga Island radar site had tracked an uni- dentified target moving in an \"erratic to a triangular shaped flight pattern\" with a speed that was \"variable, from hovering to approximately one thou- sand miles per hour.\" Track Radar indicated that the object moved away from two United States Air Force jet aircraft that were ap- proaching. At that time the speed of the object was calculated at approx- imately one thousand miles per hour. Skeptics, such as Phil Klass, may seize on the fact that in the two in- stances when aircraft went to investi- gate unidentified radar targets, nothing was seen. However, tucked away in the \"Supplement to AF Form 112\" is a chronology of events indicating that when the T-33 went to investigate on March 10, \"UFO was observed to a- void jet. As soon as jet got close, UFO appeared to move away for several miles, then stop.\" An identical series of events occurred during the famous July 1952 Washington, D.C., radar- visual sightings when jet interceptors tried to close in on UFOs detected by radar. The same chronology or log reads as follows for the searchlight incident: 24:00. Radar advises that as soon as searchlight was employed, the object became evasive. Object now at 10.0 (10,000) feet, 7800 yards from site. Two returns, one at 10.0 feet, other at 08. Several other radar and/or visual sightings over the 5-day period are in- cluded in the intelligence report, but those cited here are sufficient to make the point. Apparently solid objects have been detected by radar, often visually confirmed, performing in ways inconsistent with any known objects or phenomena. The reports have re- ceived no organized or systematic study and instead have been brushed aside, ignored, or debunked.

Stringfield I believe at this writing that the status of my research into the legend of retrievals of crashed UFOs and the recovery and secret study of alien hu- manoids rests in limbo. Whether or not I should continue my probes, despite the encouraging procurement of testi- monials from 20 firsthand sources, de- pends on the resolution of two serious issues. One concerns my present posi- tion relative to the controversy center- ing around the photographs in my pos- session, which allege to show an alien humanoid cadaver cryogenically pre- served inside a glass case at Wright-Pat- terson AFB. This issue, which involves far more than photographs, also shows signs of somebody cleverly playing their hand at hocus pocus. The other issue relates to a sudden shift to si- lence of my key informants coinci- dental with a dry-up, of 29 potential sources. It is, of course, too early to make a judgment on either issue. Per- haps the mystery of silence, so obvious since early October 1980, can be at- tributed to nothing more than apathy or the diversion of politics, football or the effects from inflation and reces- sion. But, considering the sensitivity of the subject, I cannot help but wonder if somebody in a powerful position pressed the \"silence\" button. And, one may also speculate about the timely release in August, 1980, through the auspices of Williard Mclntyre, of an- other set of photos alleging to show a burnt alien body recovered from a Mexican crash site, in 1948. According to Bill Spaulding of GSW, his analysis suggests that the \"alien\" body in the photo was a monkey used in early military rocket tests. In intelligence circles they call it \"disinformation.\" Its basic purpose is to discredit, defuse, or destroy a truth, a belief, a person's character to meet an objective - ad infinitum. Some- times it requires a master plan involv- ing many people; sometimes it is a simple strategem using only a well placed rumor — or a photograph! On the assumption that the Spaulding analysis is correct (or, for that matter not correct), the Mclntyre photos, released publicly through re- searchers Charles Wilhelm and Dennis Pilichis (during the time I was at a peak getting firsthand reports with promises of more to come), stand a good chance of being discredited. But, the master plan - if you will - may have other designs, such being that a pall of doubt and suspicion will be cast over any photograph(s) that may sur- face showing alien cadavers, and be- yond that, any serious research into the story of crash/retrievals. The photos I possess, allegedly showing alien cadavers, have not, for- tunately, been publicly released with my endorsement. The story about them as told in this report is complex and seems shadowed with strong over- tones of conspiracy. Disinformation? If so, the simple strategem was the use of photographs. What a way to cool off a hot subject. Whatever the grand strategy, if that be the case, I feel urged to set the record straight re- garding my role in the handling of my set of controversial photographs. To offset a wild rash of rumors and speculation, and some recently con- trived slurs to destroy my credibility, here are the facts about my involve- ment in the issue of photographs: My first contact in the photo affair was \"B\" of New York who called me on June 30, 1979, to relate knowledge of a person, \"M\", in New England who had allegedly been under surveillance because of possession of vital Intelli- gence information, and photographs concerning UFOs and related subjects. \"B\" was aware of limited covert inter- play of certain people in the case. Wanting no involvement, he gave me the name of person, \"J\" as my con- tact, and who would serve as my inter- mediary and consultant to this date. I reached \"J\" by phone on July 9, 1979. Negotiations for me to procure photographs and other data concern- ing alien bodies at Wright-Patterson AFB were conducted with \"J\" mostly by phone. And, I learned of \"M's\" perilous involvement with the author- ities as a security risk. Discreet arrangements were made for the three of us to meet in **** *********** March 22, 1980. Here, I was shown three 8 x 10, black & white photos and sepia-toned slides, depicting alleged alien bodies in \"deep freeze\" at Wright-Patterson. \"M\" ex- plained that the photos were only a part of a number of photos he had in his possession showing different views of the body and also one or more showing a \"landed\" UFO at an Air Force base. His source for the bulk of his photos was an unidentified Intelli- gence employee, but he said that he had also a free flow of information from another prime source. Combin- ing this material, \"M\" was in position to present some profound lectures, but, he confessed, his candor with privileged information soon became his undoing. In short, it led to an ab- rupt confrontation with the Intelli- gence community, the results of which I choose not to reveal at this time. But if \"M's\" story was true, I reasoned, it would be ample reason for his cautious negotiations with me. My main thrust in our eyeball-to-eyeball meeting was to gain \"M's\" trust in me and to even- tually get to see or use in someway, the more spectacular photos he claim- ed to possess. Also, to make our long (Continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(Photos, continued) trips to**** meaningful in serving our mutual interests, I offered him two op- tions to consider for release of his photos. One outlet was to feature the photos (with convincing backup data) in my next monograph as a powerful follow-up to The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome; the other suggestion was for me to release the photos, plus whatever support material he could provide, at the forthcoming MUFON symposium in Houston in June 1980. If all went well, according to \"M,\" I should expect additional photos for future use, perhaps in time for my next paper. However, he stress- ed the point that he wished to write his own book someday in which he would not only publish his best photos but expose the whole sordid story of his UFO misadventures. It was obvious to me that \"M's\" ultimate objective in our joint venture was to avenge his mistreatment at the hands of the authorities. Yes, Houston could be the testing ground agreed to by both \"J\" and \"M,\" and yes, I would play the game, despite the risks, to get to the bottom of a deep- ening mystery. The prints produced by \"M\" in Erie were not impressive, but maybe my expectations were too great. Blown up to 8 x 10's, they ap- peared to have been reproduced sev- eral times since duplicating the orig- inals. The most striking print, show- ing a view of the full body in a glass case, appeared retouched. I was sus- picious. When questioned, \"M\" ex- plained that he, too, was puzzled by it but accepted the irregularity on the basis that the photo was one of a set taken in similar surroundings and using identical cryogenic accoutrement. He also pointed out that some of the orig- inal 4x5 prints were stamped on the reverse side, \"Top Secret, Wright-Pat- terson AFB,\" with a number and an officer's initials. He did not bring these prints, however, so I requested xerox copies showing this legend on the back. They never arrived. Of signifi- cance, \"M\" brought two photos, 8 x 10 blow ups from slides (also on hand for review) each showing different views of what appeared to be dismem- bered or maimed bodies. Excess graini- ness and shadows obscured details, but in evidence was a tilted head, a section of arm and a bent leg with foot. These. two unusual photos, like the others, showed the standard accoutrements, such as downdraft units and beakers near the head emitting vapors. I look back now and wonder about these two photos. Why would some one faking photos go to the trouble of producing a macabre scene, and why would that same someone who had used the best of props for other views become so sloppy if trying to portray a dismem- bered body? If staged, there was noth- ing clever about it. The pictures were ridiculous. I remember telling \"M\" that these photos looked more gen- uine than the one which seemed to show retouching. Before leaving **** \"M\" allowed me to pose, holding the three photo- graphs in my lap. Communications in- tensified through April and May. I called \"J\" on a weekly basis and long letters came from \"M\" explaining his precarious position. He claimed that he would have to take every precau- tion because he had reason to believe that he was under constant surveil- lance. On May 6, 1980, came a bomb- shell. A local colleague who had my posed photo, taken in ****, brought into my office a copy of the July is- sue of UFO Sightings, a new pulp magazine published by Myron and Irving Pass. Featured in this issue was an article by David McCarthy, titled \"The Quest For Teleporta- tion,\" that included a full page picture of a humanoid body lying face-up in a glass case equipped with downdraft units and beakers emitting vapors. The caption read, \"A prototype cryo- genic freeze chamber. The person in- side is actually a mannequin encased in special protective mylar foil.\" Ex- cept for the body's position in the glass case, and some extra accoutre- ments outside the case, the picture was strikingly similar to the one print that \"M\" had revealed in **** The next day I called \"J\", who, stun- ned by my disturbing revelation, pro- mised to call \"M\" that evening. The next day I called again to learn that his source believed he knew the ans- wer and would write to me soon. Needless to say, I could rationalize many possible answers in what ap- peared to be a game of hocus pocus. What was \"M's\" hand in it or was he being used? And, what part, if any, did the timely July issue of UFO Sightings, a new publication which reached the newsstand in May, have in the overall riddle? I had dozens of questions that needed \"M's\" explana- tion. On May 7, 1980, Bob Pratt, a trusted friend and seasoned writer for the National Enquirer, visited Cincinnati on a special non-UFO as- signment. During lunch, I let him in on my puzzlement. I showed him the photos posed in Erie and a xeroxed copy of UFO Sightings. When I ex- pressed my desire to dig deeper into the mystery without publicity or tip- ping my hand to research, he pledged his cooperative silence. Correspondence from Source Of salient interest are excerpts from letters I received from \"M,\" fol- lowing my request for an explanation of the suspect picture in UFO Sight- ings. In a letter, dated May 7, 1980, addressed to \"J\" from \"M\" (xeroxed copy sent to me by \"J\" for my file) I quote the following: Dear J: After buying a copy of the issue and examining the photographs on page 41, I thought a letter would be better than a phone call. The photo is without question identical to one of the many different photos I do have and identical to the one I sent to 'MR' (\"M\" identifies \"MR\" as a probable FBI agent) back in March 1979. . . (Seven paragraphs omitted here which criticizes the phony stories published by the Pass Brothers in their maga- zines, Ancient Astronauts and Official UFO.) The photos I have are from a reliable source and I have many of them show- ing a) mangled humanoid forms, burn- ed or whatever, b) clear black and whites, c) color representations of two totally different types of aliens and, d) different bodies of the same type as illustrated in article in question. May I suggest that the mannequin concept is also phony. First, for what purpose would such an institution build a man- Iged mannequin? Why so many differ- ent types? It doesn't add up. Of 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"course, they don't have all the pictures do they? Even the chambers in which bodies are enclosed are slightly differ- . ent in some of my pictures, especially where the bodies are of a different race...\" Other notable points in \"M's\" letter to \"J\" follow: MR had a copy of the photo and it is the one that appears in the arti- cle. . .ten's crash/retrieval project is the biggest blockbuster in years if not the biggest thing in UFOlogy... I know they know I have photographic evidence somewhere. . . I can now prove pretty conclusively that there was a real conspiracy to silence me involving among other things, the alien bodies. . 'MR' and 'H' are govern- ment agents and their main interest in me was the photograph evidence on alien bodies. . .Now, I can only say what I have been saying all along and what I told Len, my source is good and reliable and that the photos were from Intelligence files. I have no way of telling their authenticity except why were they TOP SECRET in the agen- cy? My next letter came from \"M\" dated May 20, 1980, from which ex- cerpts follow: . . .Some thoughts on the situation: First, if I were you and you plan to mention the photographs in the mag- azine, I would stay clear of condemn- ing or debunking the magazine. . .this can only hurt your presentation as I am sure anybody who knows anything about UFOs already is aware of the status of that magazine. Instead, I would say that the photo appeared in a magazine and. then hold up the glossy print of that photograph (one of those I'm sending you) and say I am holding an actual photographic print of this picture made from the negative which I have access to. Then go on without any further delay and tell how the picture may have gotten into print: via me to an FBI agent. . . Either that or the magazine didn't know what they were printing - and that, too, is a possibility. . .one more point I need to stress re the authentic- ity of the pictures: All I can say is that the source is reliable, the pictures did come from where I said and that I have had some of these since early 1978... I cannot even say that my source knows for sure what they really are. .. On June 2, 1980, \"M's\" promised prints arrived. Developed by a local trusted photographer at his expense were eight 4x5 prints mounted two- up on cardboard. Seven showed differ- ent views of an \"alien\" body, all en- cased under glass, each showing similar down draft units around the body, each with beakers emitting vapors near the head. Two photos showed the \"flesh\" of the body tinted in a faded pink. But, one photo stood out; it had been tentatively promised while I was in **** and to me it was the most thought-provoking of the lot. It show- ed bones of a rib cage from which was extended an arm bent at its elbow, leading to a bulbous wrist, and in view only four fingers with claw-like nails. In many ways the hand looked similar to my drawing of an alien hand appearing in my first and second monographs on the subject of crash/ retrievals. According to \"M\" this photo was procured by his Intelligence source who got it somehow from a secret study which had been conduct- ed at a university in Pennsylvania. Even at this early stage, on a wist- ful premise there is official \"orchestra- tion\" for leaking tidbits of good in- formation, I could not help but enter- tain the notion that perhaps this was the key photo, the real one. Perhaps the others, which could be questioned because of the UFO Sightings article, could actually act as a defuser or the \"safety valve,\" so to speak, that could be used against me if necessary in my future research efforts. Also enclosed in the envelope of prints were alleged back-up memoran- da pertinent to \"M's\" confrontation with the authorities. I believe that ex- posure of their sensitive contents would not serve a meaningful purpose in this report. Speculation about high intrigue can be fun, but aware of tricks, and some perils, I weighed all the issues. Whatever was afoot, I reasoned, I would go to Houston and ever so cautiously \"drop the bomb\" as \"M\" commented in one of his letters. The Houston Affair Up to the last week it was not actually decided whether I would get to Houston. There was a question of transportation and who could make the trip. Finally, the word \"go\" came from Tom Deuley, Maryland research- er. He, in his camper, would leave Washington, D.C., with Dick Hall, editor of MUFON UFO Journal, and pick me up enroute, each sharing the expenses. In a quiet moment on the way, I showed Hall the photos, the memoranda and a xeroxed copy of UFO Sightings. As I recall, he agreed that I was involved in a \"damned-if you-do-or-don't\" situation, that the alien corpse photos were questionable and made more so by the picture in UFO Sightings. He also said he recall- ed seeing the picture somewhere be- fore and dubbed the retouched photo \"Oscar.\" He also agreed that I should go through with the venture but skip any reference to the memoranda. At a later stopover, I showed the photos to Deuley. He was impressed by the claw-like hand and rib cage photo but wondered about the others. Shortly after arriving .in Houston, June 6, 1980, a brief meeting was called by Walt Andrus to review the photos. Attending were Paul Cerny, Bill Leet, Tom Deuley, his brother Bruce (a photo expert), and Dick Hall. Andrus had already agreed that I could have about 10 minutes to present my mes- sage about my special research pro- gress at the next day's main meeting. The stage was set. I wrote my message that evening, being very generous with the word \"ALLEGED\" in reference to the photo prints. The next day John Schuessler, Deputy Director of MUFON, introduced me to the audi- ence ahead of the featured speakers. My message is a matter of record, pub- lished in July issue of the MUFON UFO'Journal. As everyone who heard my statement, or talked with me then (and since) can verify, I made it em- phatically clear that the photos I car- ried, in a briefcase at my side, could be hoaxes (like others I had seen) and that the photos would have to be au- thenticated before releasing to the media. I did not show the photos to the audience, or later to the inquiring media. As the day wore on, and as pre- arranged, I showed the photos selec- tively to a few more close researchers, {Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Photos, continued) medical people and NASA personnel. Among the viewers were John Schues- sler, Alan Holt, Dennis Stacy, Bill Moore, Stan Friedman, Jerry Clark, John Timmerman, Dr. Henry Mon- teith, and Dr. Richard Niemtzow. I wanted their reaction. Most reserved judgement, agreed that I should probe more for substantiation — and all stop- ped for a good look at the photo showing the clawlike hand and rib cage. Nobody panicked. By the day's end, several people from the crowd stopped me to relate they knew of new sources with crash/retrieval in- formation. One knew of an \"official\" movie taken of a crash/retrieval. From June through September 1980, UFO input was brisk. New sources surfaced to relate stories of their experiences in military retrieval operations and still more potential sources loomed who seemed ready to talk, that is, according to intermedi- aries who seemed eager to help. Also, during this period, to my consternation, I received my first re- ports from firsthand witnesses who told of live entities in military cus- tody. One source saw three disabled \"aliens\" being helped by medics into an ambulance from a crashed craft; another encountered a live one under unusual circumstances at a complex near Wright-Patterson AFB; and still another claimed he played a vital role in a retrieval operation in Hawaii, in 1944. Surprisingly, by the first week in October, 1980, I had 20 firsthand reports, 10 more since the publication of my monograph, The UFO Crash/ Retrieval Syndrome in January 1980. I felt confident, and if only a third of the 29 potential sources would come through as promised'by their inter- mediaries, I would be ready to start preparing my next monograph by November 1980. During this period of euphoria, others in highly placed professional positions offered more encouraging news. A physicist who had seen the photos called me to relate that a col- league, \"in position to know,\" com- mented that my photos were \"genu- ine.\" Even my medical informant broke silence in August to say that he 14 could not comment on the photo per se, but the body shown had similar features to the body he had seen dur- ing autopsy. But, beneath the surface of encouragement, ominous new evi- dence had already begun its slow ero- sion process against \"M's\" photo- graphs. No sooner than I had returned from Houston in June, Dick Hall and John Schuessler both reported to me that digging into their magazine files they found a copy of Ancient Astro- nauts, December 1977 issue, with a picture on the cover showing \"Oscar\" the retouched humanoid body under glass — the same photo supplied to me by \"M.\" Obviously the Pass Broth- ers, Myron and Irving, had been in- volved with a mysterious source sev- eral months before \"M\" obstensibly got into the act. Under a banner head- line, . . . \"Secret Chambers Beneath the Empire State Building,\" the story told of the discovery of an alien body underground in cryogenic suspension. The story got more attention in Sep- tember 1978, when Official UFO dis- played a full page ad promoting a pos- ter showing the same recovered body. The copy read, \"A specially Selected Limited Edition Hand-Signed by Dr. L. K. Barnes.\" Price: $13.00. Indeed, the Pass Brothers involvement in the photograph affair, dating back to 1977, was a setback, but it came as no surprise. The UFO Sightings article, seemingly timed to coincide with my Houston revelation, was the tip off of more to come. Fortunately, the media was not involved, and only a handful of respected researchers had seen my set of photos. Although they express- ed concern for me, and, as one lament- ed that I was the subject of a \"cruel hoax,\" I felt safe to quietly pursue my investigation into the deepening mys- tery. There was far more to the whole issue than the photos, whether they were real or bogus. Somewhere there was a snake in the grass, the perpetra- tor being a sinister and powerful force in the private sector, or, the Intelli- gence community was up to some tricks to discredit my work. I had to find the answer — despite rumors and criticism. I called \"J\" about the problem and he expressed dismay; but he didn't have the answers to the scores of ques- tions. All he knew was that \"M\" was in hiding because of a new round of surveillance. I tried to reach the Pass Brothers at S.J. Publishing, Inc. in Ft. Lee, New Jersey, for a committal statement, but to no avail. The opera- tor simply stated that no phone for that office was listed. I made other probes, trying to find a new clue, in- cluding a call to Jim Moseley in Ft. Lee, who might know something about the Pass Brothers' operation. I knew Moseley since 1954, and al- though he published a satirical paper on UFOs for the \"fun of it,\" he did have a good handle on people involved in research, including some shady ones. He promised to do some prob- ing. A week later, in September, he called me to relate that he talked with one of the former staff members of the Pass complex. Regarding the pic- tures, \"They are phonies,\" said Mose- ley \"According to the editor, the bodies were models, staged for enter- tainment purposes.\" He went on to relate that a set (six photos) were bought by the Pass Brothers for use in their magazines. But Moseley could not identify the photographer, or other specific details. New Photo More calls to \"J\", on a weekly basis, in the hope to get \"M\" to an- swer questions. Stressed was the need for more photographs, specifically, a better shot of the claw-like hand and rib cage. Finally, a break in the silence came on September 16, 1980, when \"M\" sent me an enlargement of the hand, arm, and rib cage photo. In this photo more detail was shown of the clavicle or collarbone. A note explain- ed that whatever the nature of the bones, they did receive TOP SECRET handling. They were shipped from an airbase in Florida to Wright-Patterson and then on to the university in Penn- sylvania for study. In my continuing quest for in- formation, and keeping Dick Hall post- ed on all my ups and downs, I made plans to go to Cleveland, Ohio, as a guest of the Cleveland UFOlogy Pro- ject (CUP) to bring a young lady for professional hypnosis based on her claim to have had a possible abduc- tion experience in the Spring of 1980,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"near Cincinnati. This trip was timed to coincide with a regular CUP meet- ing on September 20, 1980. At the last minute, the girl could not make the trip. Knowing most of the mem- bers of CUP, I decided to go anyway. While there, researcher Stan Tytko of- fered to experiment with my photos. On the assumption that the photos showed unusual luminous highlights of muscle in the torso, arms, and legs, he made a set of slides reversing the lights and darks. The results, which we agreed proved nothing, were none- theless interesting. The luminous areas of the body, in reverse, showed the correct position of the heart, kidney, and liver — all highly vascular organs. Coincidence? For the evening's meeting, I de- cided to show the slides and relate my general progress and frustration in crash/retrieval research. I asked if the press were present (no) and that no one take photos of the slides on the screen. Again, I carefully stated that the pictures of the bodies were still not substantiated and that this test was just one of a number of continu- ing probes to find the truth. Present at the meeting, by hap- penchance, were Charles Wilhelm of Cincinnati and Dennis Pilichis of Rome, Ohio, who had appeared live on a TV station in Cleveland to pro- mote their photos purporting to show an alien body recovered in a Mexican UFO crash in 1948. (Wilhelm had re- leased these photos, received from Williard Mclntyre, on WLW-TV, Cin- cinnati, August 21, 1980. Right in my backyard.) Both, recognizing the pic- tures on the screen as being identical with the Pass Brothers' magazines, were quick to condemn the photos. Later, in a more cordial atmosphere, we managed to discuss our relative positions. I said briefly that my re- search regarding my photos went deeper than what appeared on the sur- face, and I advised that they be careful in regards to their source. — Williard Mclntyre, or better yet,his source, the alleged navy photographer. There was no hiding the fact that possibly Wil- helm and Pilichis on one end, and Stringfield on the other, were being used as a media for purposes of dis- information. Sudden Silence On October 12, 1980, I talked with a new firsthand source who de- scribed his experience as witness of a retrieval operation in Yucca Valley, California, 1947. That was my last firsthand informant. My progress into crash/retrieval research stopped there abruptly. Since that date, I have run into a brick wall. All sources — both old and potential ones — all went si- lent. Intermediaries, who agreed to pursue their sources, had one reason or another to excuse their source's silence. Some could not be reached. One admitted his fear of reprisals. Others just disappeared. Another quit research and, after some disturbing experiences, left town. It was hard to believe that 29 potential sources could go dry just as though somebody had pressed a button. But the silence didn't stop with the witnesses. The withdrawal into silence went deeper. On October 21, 1980,1 called Bob Barry, Director of 20th Century UFO Bureau, and who had made a major contribution to my recent monograph regarding privileged in- formation from his contact, a former C.I.A. employee. Barry had promised to be in touch with his source to get his comments on my photos and my knowledge of cases relative to live en- tities in military custody. Said Barry bluntly, \"My source can't talk about UFOs. He refused to answer any of my questions on the photos or the live retrievals. . .He's had his knuckles spanked. . .\" For the record, Barry had earlier asked his contact to com- ment on the body from a xeroxed copy of my print I had sent him for this purpose. On August 13, 1980, Barry's former C.I.A. friend respond- ed, attesting that he saw no similarity in the body or the head compared with what he had seen during a re- trieval . operation in 1962. Silence likewise with my medical source, who had sent me a statement in 1979, pub- lished in my recent monograph. In my concentrated effort to get more spe- cific information relative to the hand, arm and rib photo, I called my source in October. His only remark was, \"I can't comment on anything.\" A com- plete withdrawal, since his earlier ap- praisal of the photos in August 1980. The hand, arm, and rib photo still stands out as the key bit of evi- dence, unresolved. To my knowledge, the Pass Brothers don't have it, at least not yet. Whoever might have faked it would have had access to some good anthropological bones and the know-how to put them to- gether to create their monstrous \"Piltdown.\" In pursuit of answers for this one photo, I have consulted scien- tific experts. So far, I have received a response from Dr. Anthony Perzig- ian, Ph. D., Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Cincinnati, who examined the photo and sent me the following statement: Dear Mr. Stringfield: Earlier this month at your and Pro- fessor Harry Mark's request I ex- amined photographs in your pos- session. Pictured were some unusual kind of creature which gave the ap- pearance of having a simian (ape) like thoracic anatomy, at least inso- far as one could tell from the rib cage. The limbs, however, displayed no particular simian like features. The upper arm was significiantly longer than the forearm in proportions one does not see in apes. The carpal or wrist region was quite indistinct; the hands gave the appearance of having fewer than five fingers; the fingers seemed to have claws instead of the more common nails one finds among higher primates. This organism, if it is just that, is quite peculiar and one that I can not classify as to genus and species. Moreover, I would hesitate on the basis of a photo or two to suggest that it is some extra-terrestrial form vis a vis a fabrication. Best of luck in your work.. This report, in brief, tells the basic story of my part in the misadventure of the \"M\" photos. There remain many questions, and, of_ putting the jigsaw pieces in their right places. There are, indeed, more pieces to the puzzle not yet revealed. As I write the close of this report, long silence has ended from my source \"M.\" In a letter dated November 27, 1980, he writes in part: . . .1 am in full realization of the posi- tion you are in, and I do remember (Confined on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"California Report By Ann Druffel New California UFO Photos In April of this year I learned from Mr. Raymond Bayless that a friend of his, Mr. Wesley Frank, had taken a series of five photos of an un- identified object on February 13, 1980. The series of sequential color slides depicted the movement of a large, luminous object along the ridge of a hill in the Tehachapi Mountains of California. Mr. Bayless is a noted psychic re- searcher, and he had been conducting psychokinetic (PK) research with Mr. Frank for some time. He had found that Frank possessed considerable abil- ity in this area; for example, he could produce raps and audible rings on a small bell under scientifically control- led conditions.1 He verified the integ- rity of the witness. In Bayless' opin- ion, Frank's statements regarding his photographs could be accepted as ra- tional and honest. Wesley Frank is in his thirties, unmarried and an intelligent, sensitive individual. He saw duty as a foot sol- dier in Vietnam.

Enjoying the mountains in their natural beauty and solitude, he had been in the habit of going 2 weeks at a time to the Tehachapi Mountains, which are about 130 miles from his home in the San Fernando Valley. During these brief vacations he lived in a trailer belonging to friends. About 11:30 a.m. or 12:00 noon on February 13, 1980, he was photo- graphing cows, bushes, and juniper trees on the hills of the Piute Indian reservation, on a ridge about 5,000 feet high. He was enjoying the view over the Indian reservation; he had already taken two or three photos and was concentrating on a juniper tree which had an odd and photo- graphically pleasing shape. His Olym- pus camera was loaded with film which had a 64 ASA rating, and the f-stop was 16. He does not remember the shutter speed he was using at the time. Out of the corner of his right eye, he noticed a white glow on a ridge 2 or 3 miles across a small valley. Look- ing squarely at the glow, now in a southerly or southeasterly direction, he realized that it was large object traveling slowly along the foothills of the Techachapi Mountains. The ob- ject^) seemed at times to be two bright spots clumped close together. One of the \"objects\" reminded him of a bright glowing trail. His first thoughts were that this might be either smoke or a runaway missile. Realizing that a tripod-fixed camera would produce a steadier photo, he began to secure his camera to the tripod he was carrying with him. This took a few minutes to set up, during which the object(s) contin- ued to move slowly along the ridge of the hill in the distance, in what was ap- parently a northeasterly direction. As Frank readied his camera to photograph the strange object, he saw a B-52 high in the sky in the general direction he was looking. The aircraft was very high, trailing vapor behind it. It made a sharp turn as it was some- where in the vicinity of the object(s) far below it, and headed back the way it had come. \"I was watching the B-52,\" Frank said in a recorded interview, \"and out of the corner of my eye I noticed the thing on the ground disappeared com- pletely. After the B-52 completed its turn and continued on its former course, the object reappeared as in- stantly as it had disappeared.\" In- trigued, Wesley then took a picture of the object. It moved further along the ridge and he took a second picture. \"After that 1 just kept looking at the object(s), but it didn't move any more. The thought occurred to me that it was a runaway missile, and that the second glow attached to the main object was vapor or smoke. Then when two Phantom jets came over (travel- ing from east to west), they came down and went across the hill where the object was. It disappeared again, and when the (Phantoms) were gone, it reappeared a little further along the ridge of the hill. I took another shot, and then when the object moved again, a fourth shot. It looked more like one object when it reappeared, and the photos show this. I stood there and watched it.\" About 15 minutes after Wesley took the fourth photo, two military helicopters came by from over the Piute Mountains in the north. The two craft crisscrossed the hill. Again the object instantly disappeared. Wesley 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"was struck by the fact that the heli- copters' crisscross flight seemed to be a -search pattern. Since they came out of the north he assumed they were Army craft; there is an Army base some miles away in that direction. Wesley was watching the object(s) across private ranch land which com- prised a small valley (altitude 3,800 feet). This is the level land shown in the accompanying photo. The identity of the owners and names of the ranches concerned are being kept con- fidential until investigation is com- plete. Wesley judged that the object was on mountainous property belong- ing to a second large ranch owner be- yond the private ranch in the valley below him. The helicopters took some time to complete their \"search\" pattern; Wesley lost track of the time but judges it could have been 30 minutes or even longer. The two choppers then disappeared back into the north- ern sky and the object reappeared once more. It had moved still further toward the northeast, but abruptly changed position. It was now seen a short distance down the slope, be- tween the hill and the witness. At this point, Wesley took his fifth photo. Shortly afterward, the object disap- peared again. Although he remained watching, it did not show itself again. The duration of the entire episode was between an hour and an hour and one- half. In actual walking distance, the ob- ject was about 7 miles from Wesley's location, but as previously stated, the actual distance as the crow flies was between 2 and 3 miles. The object was about one-half moon diameter in ap- parent size. After Wesley Frank received his slides back from the commercial de- veloper, he was relieved to see that the pictures depicted what had been vis- ible to his eyes. Raymond Bayless, the witness, and myself projected and studied all five slides at Bayless' home and the consensus was that the pic- tures were worthy of in-depth investi- gation. The photos show clear, cloudless sky - an unbroken blue except for remnants of what might be the B-52's dissipating vapor trail in some of them. The object itself is bright and lumi- nous in comparison with its mountain- ous surroundings. The color film shows the predominantly green back- ground as varying shades of blue; Frank accounts for this by the bright- ness of the noonday light and the fact that the film was perhaps not ideal for the occasion. The object is barely visible on the slides, but in 8x10 blow- ups made later on, the image is be- tween 1 and 2 millimeters in length. The fourth slide, when projected, clearly showed a single object, near which was a thin, white haze resembl- ing dissipated vapor or smoke. In this single aspect, the object revealed a fairly crisp, convex bottom edge, but the top was fuzzy like the entire ob- ject in the other four photos. It was speculated that the thin haze repre- sented the denser \"vapor\" or \"smoke\" which seems clumped onto the main object in the other four photos, but in this one particular slide the \"smoke\" is being seen in another aspect. Wesley Frank is satisfied that the pictures are perfectly focused, except for the nearest bushes in the fore- ground which were very close to the tripod and camera. Frank kept reiterating that the re- peated disappearances and reappear- ances of the object were like \"turn- ing on and off a light.\" His first im- pression that the object was a crashed, runaway missile became untenable in view of the apparent ability to mate- rialize and dematerialize. He continued to think that part of the image, at least, might be \"smoke,\" but when the developed slides revealed the ob- ject — even in its double aspect — as concise and fairly substantial, he was obliged to discard this tenuous hy- pothesis. As he picturesquely de- scribed his dilemma, \"Smoke can't travel from here, to here, to here.\" He displayed the normal perplexity of a UFO witness trying to find a log- ical explanation for an illogical occur- rence . Frank is willing to accompany re- searchers to the site in an attempt to gather documentation on the sighting and to explore the area in an effort to find physical traces where the UFO evidently traveled along the ridge. In October 1980 two of Frank's slides were analyzed by a microphoto- graphic technician who has recently offered his services to MUFON in this area.^ He produced extreme blowups of the object(s) and succeeded in en- larging the image to one inch in length. Further study by microphotographic techniques seemed to indicate that the object was shaped more or less like a top, or generally conical. In his opin- ion, judging from his 25 years' experi- ence in photographic work, the object seems to have a vapor behind it (to its left on the blowup) and was spinning or gyrating. In the two photos which depict its movement from the ridge down onto the hillside, this whirling motion is most evident. A rough es- timate of the object's true size is 200 to 300 feet diameter. The grain of these blowups is, of necessity, very coarse and much de- finition is lost. Our hope is that this case will interest other photographic analysts, particularly those with com- puter-enhancement facilities, who might wish to participate in the in- vestigation.-^ Any forthcoming in- formation about these Tehachapi photos will be shared with MUFON UFO Journal readers at a later date.. One of the curious factors in this case, of course, is the fact that the wit- ness, Wesley Frank, has demonstrated PK abilities. Do these factors - photo- graphing UFOs and psychic talents — go hand in hand? Thinking back on other cases, UFO photos and psychic abilities seem linked, such as with Stella Lansing and Uri Geller. Perhaps it is more than coincidental that Wes- ley Frank was able to photograph a UFO. NOTES 1.

Manor Books has released two paperbacks dealing with the cattle mutilations. \"The Terror\" by Michael D. Albers is non-fiction and the second by John J. Dalton titled \"The Cattle Mutilators\" is listed as a science fiction novel. Incidentally, cattle mutilations have become news in Texas during November. Prominent theories ex- plaining these precise surgical opera- tions are UFOs, satanic cult groups, or government measurements related to nuclear power plant contamination. After personally viewing a few animals and interviewing the owners of de- stroyed livestock, I find it very diffi- cult to comprehend how a human could perform such meticulous sur- gery in a pasture or cattle pen, espe- cially during darkness. Doctors of veterinary medicine are equally baf- fled. If UFOs or their occupants are responsible for over 8000 animal deaths in the west and midwestern states during the past 5 years, this is a very serious repercussion of the UFO phenomenon that remains to be re- solved. During the periods between UFO flaps when the public interest in UFOs seems to subside, this is the prime time for investigators and researchers to be trained and prepared for the next outbreak of sightings. These lulls in UFO activity also create a common problem. When an apparent good sighting is reported in the news media, field investigators from each of the major UFO organizations plus many independent investigators descend up- on the area and sometimes overwhelm not only the witnesses, but also the news media representatives, with pre- mature statements of what was ob- served prior to conducting an investi- gation. The few vocal debunkers also get newsworthy attention by explain- ing the sightings from the comfort of their home or office easy chair with- out conducting an investigation. The recent Anderson, South Carolina, sightings were a typical example. The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) and the Mutual UFO Net- work (MUFON) have been working as a team since 1973 when Dr. Hy- nek first announced the formation of the Center on the Dick Cavett TV Program. The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all MUFON State Directors, Assistant State Di- rectors, State Section Directors, and some Consultants are on file at CUFOS in Evanston, 111., so UFO sighting reports received from law enforcement agencies via the UFO hotline may be assigned to the near- est MUFON officer for investigation. The field investigator assigned to the case is expected to send their report to both MUFON and CUFOS. John Timmerman, Chairman of the Board for CUFOS, and Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director, have communicated with your Director and are asking what they can do to expand the cooperative relationship between the two organiza- tions in order to be more effective. Preliminary discussions have resulted in proposing and implementing the following actions: 1. John Timmerman will mail a copy of the weekly log of all UFO re- ports received by CUFOS on the UFO hotline and other sources to MUFON. 2. CUFOS is proposing that their new Field Investigators quarterly newsletter be mailed to all MUFON of- ficers listed in their files. Your Direc- tor was receptive to this suggestion. 3. Our MUFON \"UFO Sighting Questionaire - Computer Input (Form 2)\" was designed to provide the perti- nent points for insertion into UFO- CAT, the computerized listing of re- ports, originated by Dr. David Saun- ders and now operated by Fred Mer- ritt, Vice President of CUFOS. We encourage all investigators to com- plete Form 2 and attach it to Form 1 when submitting your UFO sighting questionaire. MUFON will forward the Form 2 to CUFOS for tabulation and listing in UFOCAT. Since MUFON does not have convenient access to a computer for this purpose, it is imper- ative that these reports should be list- ed. 4. Starting with 1970, MUFON has had an officer of PEG or its suc- cessor CUFOS as a speaker at our An- nual MUFON UFO Symposium. Dr. J. Allen Hynek has consented to speak at our 1981 event in Boston. Officers speaking have been Sherman J. Larsen 1971 and 1975, Dr. David Saunders 1972, Dr. Hynek 1970, 1973, 1976, 1978, 1979, and Fred Merritt 1980. John Timmerman addressed MUFON's annual corporate meeting in 1980. 5. The Center for UFO Studies has been using the MUFON Field In- vestigators Manual for CUFOS investi- gators since 1975. These are only preliminary steps to greater cooperation between MUFON and CUFOS so as to provide more effective investigations, research, and a united front in resolving this per- plexing enigma.

Valerie Jean Ransone of the Network termed the contacts \"part of a precise program of communication\" on the part of the aliens. An excerpt from Erich von Daniken's latest book, SIGNS OF THE GODS, is presented in the October 14 issue. Von Daniken cites the theory of British researchers Dale & Sasson, who contend that the Biblical \"Ark of the Covenant\" was a miniature atomic\" reactor which pro- duced \"manna\" for the Israelites' 40- year journey. TV star Cindy Williams tells of her UFO sighting in the Nov- ember 11 issue of the ENQUIRER. Appropriately, she plays the part of a UFO \"believer\" in her new film, \"Uforia.\" E. Lee Speigel's \"UFO Update\" column in the November issue of OMNI is devoted to UFO reports and research in the Soviet Union. Much of the information is taken from a Soviet publication, OBSERVATIONS OF ANOMALOUS ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA IN THE USSR, which has recently been published in an Eng- lish translation by the Center for UFO Studies. The December issue of OMNI has Harry Lebelson's report on UFO photos taken at Silkeborg, Denmark, in 1979. An interesting article by Karl T. Pflock in the November issue of FATE examines Thomas F. Monteleone's tale of extraterrestrial contact. Mon- toleone has confessed that the account is a hoax, dreamed up to provide \"sub- stantiation\" for contactee Woodrow Derenberger's stories of meetings with beings from the planet Lanulos. Pflock has quite a bit to say about author John Keel's acceptance of both the Derenberger and Monteleone accounts. In the December FATE, Australian newsman Quentin Fogarty tells the \"inside story\" of the UFOs filmed off the New Zealand coast late in 1978. The December issue of UFO RE- PORT features articles by Kal Korff, Jim Miles, Jerome Clark, D. Scott Rogo, and Charles Bo wen. Topics include the contact claims and photos of Eduard Meier, the case of the Mexi- can pilot who was accompanied by UFOs, the aftermath of UFO abduc- tions, etc. A new film \"docu-drama,\" writ- ten by lecturer/researcher Stanton T. Friedman and writer William L. Moore, is the subject of an article in the December issue of STARLOG. \"The UFO Chronicles\" examines the implications of extraterrestrial .con- tacts from the aliens' point of view. Approximately a third of the film will feature the aliens (Zeta Reticulans) telling their side of the story; the re- mainder will be documentary film from NASA, Jet Propulsion Labora-. tory, and independent UFO sightings. It all sounds extremely interesting, so we can look forward to national dis- tribution of the film in coming months. Still more rehash and non-UFO material in the No. 20 issue of TRUE UFOs & OUTER SPACE QUARTER- LY. A recently 12-page booklet, UN- USUAL MARTIAN SURFACE FEA- TURES, examines the anomalous photographs taken by Mariner and Viking space probes. Computer spe- cialists Vincent DiPietro and Greg Molenaar have computer-enhanced the Martian photos which show pyra- midal structures and what seems to be a huge human (or humanoid) face. They draw no firm conclusions from their research, but they feel the fea- tures to be very unusual and worthy of further investigation. Reproduc- tions of the original and computer- enhanced photographs are included in the booklet. It is available for $2.00 per copy (and a stamped, self-address- ed 9\" x 12\" manila envelope) from: Mars Research, P.O. Box 284, Glenn Dale, MD 20769. Posters of the Mar- tian \"face\" (17\" x 21\") are available from the same address at $5.00 each.
