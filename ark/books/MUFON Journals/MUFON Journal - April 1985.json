FROM THE EDITOR Our cover this issue, by the talented Simone Mendez, illustrates the widely reported Soviet sighting first made public in late March of this year. The jury on this one is still out; it could be a legitimate UFO or another misidentification of a secret missile launch which so confounds western observers. See \"News'n'Notes\" for more information. Inside you'll also find a variety of articles by some of today's leading ufologists that reiterate the worldwide scope of the UFO phenomenon. Most importantly, literally \"hot off the press,\" we have Jenny Randies' update of the ongoing Rendlesham Forest Affair. James Oberg looks at the tendencies of some South Americans to see fire where there is smoke, and Bruce Maccabee begins his own unusual eyewitness account of an even more unusual UFO â€” a flying \"black hole.\" Leonard Bruce takes a humorous look at E-Tees and Walt Andrus provides the latest information on the upcoming St. Louis Symposium. Next issue we'll continue Maccabee's detailed analysis and.we'll also have an Englishman's argument in favor of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, plus the usual articles and features you've come to expect of the Journal.

It was a struggle to sell the idea in the first place, both to British UFO researchers and to British publishers. Between 1981, when the three of us first began to chase the case, and August 1983, when we were able to announce the official confirmation breakthroughs on both.sides of the Atlantic, Brenda, Dot, and I often felt like lepers. We received no help, no support and our limited personal budgets were dwindling fast. REJECTIONS Similarly, the publisher with whom I have produced three of my most serious UFO books rejected the idea flat, on the grounds that if the events had happened then it would be common knowledge! Likewise, we collected rejection slips like the forest itself collects pine needles in the Fall. Eventually, Neville Spearman, a tiny publishing company with almost no promotional status, took our word for it that there was real evidence. We remain very grateful to them. Even so, working with such a small company has meant that we have had great difficulty promoting what we believe to be crucial questions posed by our manuscript. Outside of East Anglia itself (see local press articles reproduced in the MUFON UFO JOURNAL issue 201) there has been absolutely no publicity for the case since the book was released in October, 1984. At the press conference, referred to in the \"Daily Times\" article, no national media sources turned up, despite being invited with a preliminary memo and reminded on the phone. Later, at my own expense, I produced two-page summaries of the conference and sent The craft which appeared after the light explosion on 30 December 1980, according to Art Wallace. (Sketched under his direction by Betty Luca.) them to all national newspaper and television sources. About twenty copies went out in all. I did not receive a single reply! SECRETS ACT The British Government can effectively smother press coverage by enforcing what is called a \"D\" (for Defence) notice. Using our \"Official Secrets Act\" (a millstone of bureaucratic legislation which can be, and often is, interpreted in whatever way best suits the party in power) the media can be legally restrained from printing anything the government of the day decides to be sensitive on security grounds. Whether or not a \"D\" notice was issued regarding Rendlesham Forest is hard to say. We have no real evidence for this statement, but it is exceedingly curious that in October, 1983, the \"News of the World\" (Britain's largest selling Sunday national) carried four successive articles- on the case, including a page-one banner headline; based on a fraction of the material available (chiefly the statements of Larry Warren, alias \"Art Wallace,\" and the Halt memo release). This also iead to many subsequent media stories in papers as diverse as \"The London Times\" and \"The Sunday People\" (a contrast not disimilar to the \"New York Times\" and \"The National Enquirer\"!) Yet the release of SKY CRASH, with all its new evidence, has created not even a trickle of media interest. The silence has been deafening. Unfortunately, as many of the British media sources are owned by big moguls, (often under the influence of \"Lord so-and-so\") the opportunities for \"a quiet word in somebody's ear\" are extensive, and all a government really needs to make sure a touchy subject is effectively stiffled. However, the attitude seems to go somewhat deeper into the character of the British; stiff-upper-lip and all that! As I write (March 1985) only two UFO publications have bothered to review the book. One,. \"QUEST\" (about the closest to American thinking published in the UK) went to town. The other dismissed it in a sea of ridicule. This magazine, \"MAGONIA,\" claims the book relfects paranoia, sloppy investigation and total exaggeration of a non-event in the first place. A third publication, from a Nottingham UFO group, has not even reviewed the book. In two sentences it says the case has been explained away as an ordinary (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"RENDLESHAM, Continued mistake, so end of report. Instead it expounds at length about psychic phenomena! BRITISH UFOLOGY Clearly, this indicates that ufology in Britain has become obsessed with the paranormal and psychological theories, a fault I admit no small level of personal liability towards. Unquestion- ably, these areas are very relevant to the UFO field. But equally certain, in my view, is the grave danger of leaning so .far in this direction that you are running the risk of toppling over the edge of a precipice. American ufology, on the other hand, has overwhelmed us with its enthusiasm for what we tried to do in SKY CRASH. It seems that the possibility of government conspiracies finds a home more acceptable in a democratic land which has learned to fight the natural tendancy of all bureaucracies to obscure anything problematic. Yet, this (to us) refreshing approach to undoubtedly serious issues does not seem to be matched by the American publishing industry. As I write, twenty-one USA publishers have rejected the opportunity to publish an edition of our book. Some use the grounds that this is an \"English\" case (ludicrous because one of our problems in selling the idea over here was that the case was too American!) Others cite the apathy displayed towards ufology these days, a fair (if sad) truth. Yet, by far the most worrying to me, is the attitude expressed in a reader's report sent us by \"Prentice-Hall\" (probably the most ufo-minded of U.S. publishers). They use this to explain why they rejected SKY CRASH. Now, I make no arguments that the book is the best ever written. I know that is not true. It is confusing and complex. It may even be hard to follow in parts. It does not read like a Spielberg movie. But we, perhaps because we are \"Stuffy\" English as Prentice-Hall explained, made the absolute decision that we were not going to hype-up a space age fairy tale from a potentially explosive case. It would have been easy to do that. To speak in \"Gee! Wow!\" Blue & white lights Tripod legs Shaft of light in which entities hovered The 27 December 1980 UFO on the ground. Based oh a sketch by Steve Roberts. terms of the awe-inspiring meeting between the aliens and a USAF Brigadier General in a dark, Suffolk wood. But that would have evaded the realities. The only way to honestly set out the facts was to recount them as we uncovered them. We could not possibly tell the story of what happened, other than as fiction, because we even now do not know what happened. UFO HYPE Yet, Prentice-Hall, very disturbingly, said we should have done that. We should have had one answer (presumably that the UFO was a spaceship) and we should have plotted and scripted the book like a novel. As it so delicately puts it, \"Gonzo Fans\" and \"UFO buffs\" want mind-blowing facts . and an easy, exciting read. It concludes by advising that the company should \"Dump these authors!\" and rewrite the book from an American point of view. This, we understand, is precisely what Prentice-Hall plans to do. Now, leaving aside the enormous expenditure of time, money and effort Brenda, Dot, and I put into our work for SKY CRASH, this attitude speaks of a real danger facing the American UFO movement. If this accurately represents the plan Prentice-Hall envisages for future UFO publications, then one has to seriously question the validity of what is likely to appear. Besides which, we most certainly did not write SKY CRASH for \"Gonzo Fans,\" but for any person who cares about the out-of-control nature of western so-called democracies and the abject diregard being shown foj basic rights of citizens. We elect governments to govern for us, not to do what they like with things such as fact, truth and integrity. It is more important to me than whatever the reality of UFOs turns out to be, that the Orwellian year of 1984 cbincidentally saw publication of both \"Clear Intent\" and \"Sky Crash,\" demonstrating as they do that Big Brother (or in the UK \"Big Sister\") is very definitely here. There has been one British newspaper story about the case, published on 5 January 1985. It was penned by Ian Ridpath (a \"space writer\" and Britain's CSICOP equivalent of Philip Klass). Ridpath's explanation of the case (a meteor attracting the men into the forest who, disorientated, see a lighthouse five miles away, and later find some rabbit holes and mistake them for landing marks) was elevated to star status very early in the affair. It has had extensive media plugging in the wake of the October 1983 revelations. But there are some rather disturbing aspects to it. LIGHTHOUSE Of course, we knew all about the lighthouse, even before Ridpath conjured it into prominence. It is much the most obvious feature of the environmental lights seen at night from the East Gate of the Woodbridge Base. Nobody on duty there can fail to be aware of it, although it is not visible in (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"RENDLESHAM, Continued daylight and so the misidentification hypothesis gains credence from that. It is how the lighthouse came to be linked to the case which is to me so intriguing. This is well worth discussing, because (odd as it might be to an American) 90 percent of the British population now , believe that the Rendlesham Forest case did not happen, that Ridpath is right, that we are all sensation- mongers, and that USAF forces in Britain are imbiciles, or more accurately, stoned-out-of-their-mind imbiciles. The theory has, almost single- handedly, ensured that SKY CRASH has clocked up practically no sales, and more importantly, that all our calls for serious media enquiries, open public investigations, and questions in the House of Commons, have been totally .rejected. Even the UFO committee at the House of Lords have refused to listen to us. It is thus seen to be of grave importance to the future development of the investigation. Essentially, the \"News of' the World\" featured the case on its front page on 2 October 1983. It immediately created impact on that same day. Within less than 24 hours, remarkable speed for a Sunday when most of. the British Press are asleep, the \"London Times\" (easily the most prestigious newspaper in Britain) had'featured the case. The rarity of UFO articles in this newspaper made the event newsworthy in itself. But its dramatic speed and very pointed attitude cannot have been a coincidence. The \"Times\" did not talk to Brenda, Dot, myself or the investigative journalists at the \"News of the World\" who had devoted over two-pages of material to the case. Instead (within a couple of hours of the story breaking) they had gone to East Anglia and filmed a young forestry worker on the site. This man, Vince Thurkettle, was about to be promoted in rank at the office, but at the time was only a junior. He told the \"Times\" when they came to him that Sunday, it was about time someone thought about an explanation less fantastic than UFOs. Steve Roberts' view of the alien contact with the Base Commander. RABBIT HOLE Thurkettle noted that about one month after the landing (which he had heard rumours about in the Forestry office) he happened upon some holes in the ground with a giant arrow scratched in the earth pointing at them (this fact has always been omitted from media references, and the time-lag between event and discovery rarely mentioned). These he was told, by some men from the base, were the marks left by the UFO. He examined them and was certain they were scratchings made by rabbits. Droppings were even visible within them. Armed with this he chanced to notice the lighthouse and pondered if it might have been the UFO. Any dumb Americans who could not tell rabbit holes might not know what a lighthouse looked like. Perhaps they had been brought up in the Nevada desert and had never seen the sea before! As you can see from this Thurkettle was hardly being over- serious. But his ideas were given huge promotion by the \"Times,\" and were endorsed by every single newspaper which reaches influential sources (i.e. the less \"popular\" press, and the ones read by financiers, ministers and civil servants). I have talked to Thurkettle on the site a couple of times since this dramatic revelation. There is no question that he is less than a hundred per cent convinced by it. He frankly admists that there are puzzles. He accepts the possibility that something else may have been involved. And he talks of his theory as if it \"just seemed like a good idea at the time.\" He also is worried, as he should be, by the giant arrow in the ground. To me this is so out of phase with the secrecy of the case it strikes me that the most likely scenario is as follows: these marks were concocted around rabbit holes after the events. The men on base were encouraged to believe they were the landing traces to aid in disinformation and to throw the hordes of curious sightseers off the scent. Their later discovery by a forestry worker, and consequent explanation, may have been a planned or unplanned bonus. Whilst Vince Thurkettle sees this (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"RENDLESHAM, Continued himself, the lighthouse/rabbits theory was gratefully seized upon by two different sources. BBC COVER-UP? Ian Ridpath, the anti-ufo debunker, was asked by the B.B.C. (Britain's state owned TV network) to produce an expose of the case. As SKY CRASH reveals, in the five days prior to that, a BBC producer we were working with (Doug Salmon) was blocked every which way he went in trying to persuade bosses to let him make a documentary on the case. In the end he put in an official protest and told us that it was clear forces in the upper echelons of the company had conspired against the programme. Ridpath once more did not talk to any of the investigators on the case before taking a crew out to film the lighthouse with Vince Thurkettle in tow. Instead he used a zoom lens and editing techniques to make the lighthouse look a darned sight stranger than it does - or indeed than it did (because when the events took place the area was masked by a thick blanket of trees, now gone, and the lighthouse was far less prominent than it is in 1985). \"What a shame another UFO case bites the dust\" was the way the affair was summed up by the BBC link man. And the shoot-em-down brigade were scoring notable successes in switching public attitudes too. However, there was a problem for Ian Ridpath. Whilst the lighthouse was a tenable explanation for the \"triangular craft\" (if you ascribe moronic intelligence to the men involved) he had no idea what they had initially seen crashing into the forest. Even CSICOP draws back from inferring \"flight\" onto lighthouses, although doubtless James Randi will be figuring out that one for his next trick! Trouble was, as Ridpath told me after the BBC programme, he could not think of an answer. But, the British bobbies came to the rescue like the cavalry of old. On the day of the original \"News of the World\" story the head of police in East Anglia had contacted the local station at Woodbridge and politely advised them they had better have a statement ready to offer the media. This same station had twice denied any knowledge of the case in our previous investigations. Once Brenda and Dot watched them examine their duty book and say there were no reports of UFOs from the base. Now, hey presto!, everything had changed. A statement offered to the press that first Sunday just happened to include some rather coincidental words. Now they did have a report. Two officers had gone out at the request of the base. They saw nothing, only the lights of the Orford Ness lighthouse. Strange that the police should just happen to mention that in their report, is it not? As soon as it got light they went back to the forest and were shown \"landing marks,\" as alleged by the airmen. These, the officers concluded, were marks left by rabbits. Frankly, I do find it more than a little peculiar that both Vince Thurkettle and the police should independently, and on the same day, end years of silence with this simultaneous conceptual breakthrough about the lighthouse and the rabbits. That smells funny to me. As it should to any half-awake investigative journalist. But the British police had another crumb of comfort for Ian Ridpath, now crusading widely on behalf of the lighthouse appreciation society. Their records showed the date as 26 December, not the 27th. On this date, so Ian Ridpath triumphantly announced, a bright meteor had been spotted at 0250 hours. Obviously this is what the men saw crashing into the forest, not literally but if you stretch your imagination a bit. Case closed. DATES I have repeatedly asked Ian Ridpath how this date squares with the fact that none of the witnesses have ever said it was the 26th (including those talked to within days of the event); that Halt's report itself (based oh interviews prior to its dating 17 days after the event) gives the 27th, that the Ministry of Defense in their first public admission to me (13 April 1983) give the date as the 27th, that anyone on duty on the 26th at 0250 hrs. would likely have begun shifts on the night of Christmas day (a fact likely to be more than usually memorable) and that Halt's report states that the traces were discovered two days after the sighting, not within six hours as police say. Ridpath's only answer to this is that all these people are wrong, otherwise I am accusing the British police of fabricating their records. Quite honestly, in view of, everything else that went on in the wake of the \"News of the World\" story, I find that position rather more probable than that everybody else got it wrong. It is just too convenient. Again, any half- awake investigative journalist ought to spot these things a mile off. Yet there is a disturbing tendency amongst such people not to do so. Ridpath still claims, 18 months later, that the case is solved. Chuck de Carro of Cable News Network came to work with Dot and I in December 1984, and rejected all these points flatly, preferring to take the word of the British police (despite a further remarkable coincidence which saw one of the two policemen, who was in the forest in December 1980, interrupt our filming on site four years later and inquire of us what we were doing!). The lighthouse theory totters on a trip-wire for many reasons. Witnesses were looking in several different directions. Civilians on the road could not possibly see the lighthouse, but they saw the UFO. As the lighthouse stayed where it was after the encounter, .how come the witnesses describe it as taking off? And so on. There are sufficient fundamental errors in the concept that it is difficult to take it seriously. What must be added is that regardless of the widespread media support for the theory it has no official backing whatsoever. The British Ministry of Defense still insist the case is unexplained. Current public relations officer at Bentwaters (Captain Victor Warzinski) told me there was never any doubt in the minds of the USAF that something had happened which has not been explained. And all the witnesses involved in the case (from seniors like (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"RENDLESHAM, Continued Colonel Charles I. Halt, down to juniors like ex-airman Larry Warren) agree that the idea is stupid. So why do the media continue to push it? And who do the media refuse to carry any counter articles? Why have I been refused on four separate occasions, since publication of the book, an hour of newspaper time to go (at my own expenses) to London and present the evidence against the lighthouse? I am afraid the answers seem pretty obvious, even if I do risk claims of paranoia by saying so. The week that our book was released (to nil publicity) another book came out (to quite a fanfare). This one is entitled Lies! Damned Lies! and is about unethical journalism. It is penned by a feature writer from the \"Times,\" that same paper which first ^set the lighthouse on its adventures. Lies! Darned Lies! has sold in great numbers and contains several pages on the case. It mentions none of the investigators, nor their investigations. Instead it lays into the \"News of the World\" with ridicule and accusations of gross exaggeration, hyping up a non- event to sell papers. In the end it specifically states that the case is \"fiction.\" LIES Under Britain's libel laws this is certainly a candidate for a lawsuit. Brenda, Dot and I supplied the data to the \"News of the World\" (under contract) and so the accusation of that material being fiction falls on us as much as the paper. To win damages all we would need to do is prove that the . evidence is not fictional. We would not even need to prove the reality of UFOs. Naturally, we would relish the opportunity. Sadly, to fight the case would take thousands of dollars, which none of us have. Despite rumours to the contrary circulating around the USA, Brenda, Dot and I are penniless thanks to this case. We are not millionaires. We have had costs way in excess of the small sum paid to us for the book, or from the newspaper. Dot's telephone was disconnected because she could not pay her bills. I have had to sell my house. Brenda has more or less had to retire from ufology. The \"News of the World\" lawyers passed judgement that the Lies! book was actionable, but the paper's sponsors backed out of the court case with no reason given. So it looks as if the get-UFOs campaign will score another victory. Ian Ridpath's January 1985 article was in \"The Guardian\" (the only highbrow newspaper, a favourite of government officials, not yet to carry the whitewash). It mentioned neither the book nor our investigations, failed to reply to any of the criticisms of the lighthouse theory we have previously set out for its writer, and stated that he had solved the case and everything else was the product of the imagination of \"UFO buffs\" and the U.S. Air Force. On 5 March 1985, I was asked to take part in a TV debate networked across the country by the I.B.A. (the independent equivalent of the BBC). The discussion was on UFOs in general, but I was promised that Rendlesham Forest would get an airing. My opponent was Dr. John Mason, an astronomer with whom I have cordial relations despite his semi-skeptical stance. However, Ian Ridpath contacted the IBA and invited himself into the audience. From the floor he hogged a lot of air-time to tell everybody he had solved the case. I was not asked to reply and was eventually forced to interrupt and shout out one, pungent and decisive remark. \"Let us kick this lighthouse nonsense in the head right away,\" I said. \"It was not a lighthouse which flew over someone's house outside the forest!\" A large section of the audience applauded this and afterwards wanted to know why so much air time was given the anti-UFO speakers. Also in the audience was Ralph Noyes, whom we mention but briefly in SKY CRASH. Noyes was head of the Ministry of Defense department DS 8 (which handles UFO matters) in the years 1969-1972. Now retired, but still covered by the Official Secrets Act, he surfaced in somewhat odd circumstances around the time of the October 1983 public pronouncements. I ani still not sure why he has been able and willing to speak so openly about government UFO policy and the Rendlesham case in particular. We speculate in the book that a move is afoot to slowly \"leak\" the truth to the public about the UFO conspiracy. If that is so the sudden high profile of such a man is understandable. If it is not so, then we have to ask what other reason there is for his remarkable bravery.

This was for leaking a letter on the sinking of the Argentine warship the \"Belgrano\" during the Falklands War of 1982. The leak was to a parliamentary member,.not the public, at a time when that man was heading a commission of all parties officially charged with the investigation of the sinking. Ponting believed it right that this .commission should see the document, demonstrat- ing attempts to disinfdrm the House of Commons about the incident. Ponting was head of Ministry of Defense department DS 5 (the exact equivalent of the one Ralph Noyes headed â€” dealing with naval matters as opposed to aerial ones). The repercussions on Ponting make the actions of Ralph Noyes all the more extraordinary, unless he knows he is acting without fear of consequence. In many discussions I have now had with him he has frankly admitted that a \"situation map\" exists logging all unexplained sightings for Ministry of Defense staff. He has told me of gun- . camera film taken by RAF pilots held under lock and key. And he has stated baldly that the Ministry of Defense have \"lied and covered-up\" the Rendlesham Forest case. Several of these things Noyes has said on radio and TV interviews he has been willing to give (especially to Nippon TV in Japan and Cable News Network in the US). He attended the press conference at the launch of SKY CRASH (although his preannounced presence still attracted no British media source). On the March 1985 TV programme he backed me all the way and said, in front of live cameras and millions of viewers, that he had no doubt that the Ministry of Defense knew far more than they were telling about UFOs, and they had very good reason for obscuring the truth. Ralph Noyes is scathing of the lighthouse explanation, and (copies sent to me) has often pressed the British government hard on the matter. He has also sent me copies of the replies he has received, but so far he 8 has no more than the evasions we have been subjected to for years. \"I can assure you that there is no evidence of anything having intruded into British airspace and 'landing' near RAF Woodbridge\" is the best the current DS 8 chief has had to say to him. But what does this ambiguous reply mean? The Ministry of Defense love putting words into inverted commas, as we explain in SKY CRASH. Does \"landing\" mean that something did intrude but it \"crashed?\" Does the word intrude mean it was there with knowledge and/or invited in? Or 'does it all mean it was one of our own craft? Each ,option remains viable in the face of what, to the casual observer, looks like a specific denial by the Ministry of Defense. Fortunately, Ralph Noyes knows all about how-the governments of the world are gifted wordsmiths. He explained to me that it is paramount that you never tell a lie, unless you absolutely have to. The same effect can usaully be achieved by wording your reply in such a way that it reads like a dismissal but will legally hold up as an acknowledgement if the issue is ever forced. Now we know why it often takes weeks or months to get answers out of government bodies. They spend hours poring over the precise wording to have the maximum effect. In June 1985, Ralph Noyes publishes his \"UFO Novel,\" which is set in Rendlesham Forest in 1990! It involves a USAF base known as \"Bentbridge,\" but in his \"factual afterword,\" which Ralph has shown me, he discusses the SKY CRASH research briefly and adds that the case in his book is definitely not based upon it! I am sure we all await with interest what his book A SECRET PROPERTY (to be published by Quartet Books) has to say. Will it be another step on the road to revelation? Is it the next lesson in the education programme for mankind? I wonder. The future certainly promises to be far from dull.

Subsequently the object ascended rapidly into the air. Both the landing and the ascension were witnessed by a group of guards about five miles away at the time. A report of the landing, prepared by agent Richard Doty of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) at Kirtland, became public in the spring of 1983, apparently as a result of a \"leak\" which was followed by a Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FOIPA) request by a UFO investigator (Barry Greenwood). . In the spring of 1984, I contacted Doty to find out if he had more information than was contained in the l l / 2 pages which had been released. I was not surprised to hear him tell me that he had interviewed the witnesses, gone to the landing site, and had written a larger report. I was not surprised because I found it difficult to believe that the Air Force would overlook something as important as a landing of SOMETHING inside a restricted (nuclear) storage area. He also said that there was more that he couldn't tell me. He further suggested that I write to Headquarters (HQ/AFOSI) to obtain all releasable information. I therefore wrote to HQ/AFOSI and requested the follow-on document under the FOIPA. The Chief of the Information Release Division, Noah Lawrence, denied that there was another document because there was none on file at HQ/AFOSI. Subsequently, because of my insistence, he called Doty on the phone and Doty (evidently) told him there was no such document. I then had. a long conversation with Lawrence and he admitted that there was a \"discrepancy\" between what Dory told me and what he told Lawrence. Lawrence then requested that Doty be interviewed by his commanding officer (Lawrence did not interview Doty himself). The commanding officer (evidently) reported back to Lawrence that Doty denied the existence of another document. According to Lawrence, without a specific name or a file location of this report continued requests are futile. Unbeknownst to me, author/ investigator Bill Moore had independently researched the case in 1982. After I had completed my investigation I told him what I had learned and he informed me of his investigation. The results of his investigation, which are included in a summary written by Moore, agree with my results, adding further evidence to my suspicion of a cover-up. This report summarizes what is now known about the incident and my attempts to find a doorway into the \"Cosmic Watergate\" which prevents the public from knowing the truth about the involvement of military intelligence agencies with the UFO problem.

The . invasion, as portrayed musically by Tschaikowsy in the 1812 Overture, was preceding smoothly, with cannon firing. I was admiring the clear evening sky and just randomly looking around at the crowd of people standing near the band shell in the Inner Harbor in Baltimore (see map). Directly east of me was the wooden battleship Constellation with its three high masts. 10 Bruce Maccabee The top of the highest mast was about 170 ft. above my altitude. South southeast of me was a modern steel battleship with radar and other antennas above its highest deck. It was while casually glancing at this ship that I first noticed the \"black hole\". TIME I couldn't identify it immediately when I first saw it, but I wasn't impressed. I could see a number of dark \"spots\" ...birds., moving around in the sky. I assumed that his particular \"spot\" would resolve itself into something recognizable and returned my gaze to the scene in front of me. But, as my eyes wandered back and forth over the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore, I again looked southeastward. By comparing the direction to the black spot with the direction to the superstructure on the steel ship, I could see that the spot was moving steadily toward my left (northward). I was surprised that I still couldn't see it well enough to identify it, so I started to watch it intently. After"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"watching the \"spot\" for about ten seconds I decided that it was sufficiently odd that I would make a note of what time I first saw it. (I have trained myself to do this whenever I decide that something in the sky looks unusual, just in case:...) Looking at my digital watch I saw that it read 7:28. (Subsequently I found that my watch was 1.5 minutes fast. Note: I made no note of the seconds, so estimates of elapsed time are only accurate to within about one- half a minute.) I returned my attention to the Baltimore Youth Orchestra directly east of me. Fifteen or so seconds later I looked back toward the steel battleship. The direction to the \"black hole\" had changed considerably. It had moved farther northward and was higher in the sky than before. It also appeared larger in angular size. I was disturbed by the fact that I couldn't see any details of the object other than its outline against the sky. I had the impression that the shape of the outline was changing continuously *as it moved northward. I pointed it out to my wife, Christine, and then looked around at the crowd of people nearby. Several people near me definitely appeared to be looking in the direction of the black object. Were they, too, looking at it? I began to watch it intently. WHAT IS IT? What is it, I kept asking myself. I could imagine trying to describe it to someone: \"Well, it had no shape., .it was amorphous.\" But that wouldn't have been correct, of course because it did have a specific outline against the sky at any instant in time. However, the outline was continually changing as it moved. There appeared to be a slight wave, like an ocean wave, moving in a counterclockwise direction around the edge as it traveled along. I thought of a wheel \"rolling\" through the sky, although there were no spokes or hub. I had the feeling that it would eventually rotate into such an orientation that I could see wings or something that would identify it. It appeared to go through a cycle of shape change. For a period of time estimated at 5 - 10 seconds the outline was quite round and it changed very slightly. Then over the next 10-15 seconds the outline became more elliptical or cigar shaped and finally over the last 10-15 seconds of the \"cycle\" the ellipticity decreased and the outline became generally round again. During each cycle as the outline became more elliptical I had the impression that it would become \"airplane-shaped\" (as an airplane seen broadside from below). I concentrated on trying to see the wings. Yet, the only actual evidence of a wing that I could see was a short protrusion that appeared at the top of the object when the outline was elliptical or cigar- shaped. If an observer on the ground saw an airplane flying past (i.e., viewed broadside from below) at an elevation angle of, say 40 degrees, the closer of the two wings would appear, in silhouette, to be above the main body of the plane and the farther wing would appear to be below the main body. I concentrated on the bottom of the outline of the object looking for the \"lower\" wing, but my efforts were in vain. I simply could not see the other \"wing.\" Nor could I see any \"tailfin\" such as would appear at the rear end of a plane. I could not even see any part of the object moving in front of or in back of any other part. In fact, there didn't seem to be any three dimensionality. From what I could see the object could have been two-dimensional...a flat black object with an outline that changed as it traveled through the sky. FLAT BLACK I was also puzzled at the lack of brightness highlights within the outline of the object. It seemed to me that it was high enough to be illuminated by the setting sun, and yet there appeared to be no surface reflections. It was as if some oddly structured three- dimensional object had been painted with flat black paint so that it would not reflect any light and then the object continually rotated in a complex way while traveling through the sky. Although I kept a close watch on this object over the next minute or so, I repeatedly cast my gaze elsewhere for short periods of time (seconds) in order to compare it with other things in the sky. There were numerous birds flying around at various distances. I had no trouble identifying them, even when they were so far away that their bodies were mere dots against the sky. I also saw a commercial jet that was about to land at Baltimore- Washington Airport. It was about 5 miles south of me at angular elevation of. about 5-10 degrees. Although all I could make out at the time I looked was the fuselage, I could see gradations of brightness of the curved greyish metallic surface as it reflected the skylight and the light of the setting sun. I could also see gradations of brightness on the bodies and wings of the birds. Gradations of brightness are a characteristic of a three dimensional object. Yet, try as I might....and believe me, I tried....! could not see any gradations of brightness associated with the black spot. It seemed to be totally black. It was as if I was looking at a \"hole\" in the'sky....a black hole into which all the illuminating light had \"fallen\" and none was coming back out. NO KITE About a minute after I first saw the object the sighting line to the object was almost over the Constellation. I asked my wife what she thought. She suggested that it was about the size of a kite, perhaps a, box kite. I did not buy this, however. No kite would travel the angular distance this object had traveled without rising up into the sky. Furthermore, it did not have the right shape or outline for either an ordinary flat kite or for a box kite. I decided that things were getting serious. I knew that I had binoculars in the back of our station wagon which was about half a mile away in a parking lot. Should I run and get them? I would have to make a mad dash through the crowd to get them, and would it be worth it? As I watched the object and thought about the binoculars it continued to move steadily northward. The angular elevation and the angular size both increased and now my line of sight passed directly over the masts of the Constellation. I decided that if I only waited and watched carefully the object would \"give itself away.\" I concentrated on the object, looking for (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"OVERTURE, Continued the slightest evidence of surface reflection. I kept thinking that the moment of identification was at hand. But it wasn't. The object reached its highest angle of elevation when it was in the direction of the Constellation almost due east of me. Apparently that was the point of closest approach because then the elevation began to decrease while it was still traveling northward at an essentially steady rate. When it was at its closest I had stuck up my arm to compare the angular size of the object with the angular size of my little finger. It was much smaller than my finger, but it did have apparent size. By subsequent measurement (after the sighting) I concluded that the maximum angular size was in the range 1/2 to 1 mm. at arms length (about 50 cm), corresponding to an angular size of 1 to 2 milliradians (e.g., 1 to 2 feet at a distance of 1000 feet). As the object continued to move northward the angular size shrank and the angle of elevation decreased. I was still debating whether or not to run for the binoculars when my view of the object was cut off by the southern corner of the World Trade Center (see map). The elevation of the sighting line was a few.floors below the top of the building which I found later to be about 405 ft. high and about 720 ft. from where I stood. Thus the elevation at this time was about 26 degrees. I looked at my watch. It read 7:30. In about two minutes this black object had traveled an angular distance which I estimated at the time to be about 60 degrees (actually it was about 70 degrees). I estimated that the Trade Center building was only about 10 degrees wide, so I expected the object to appear on the other side in a relatively short time, certainly no more than half a minute. I returned my attention to the orchestra playing right in front of me. I would glance to the left (north) of the Trade Center building every ten or fifteen seconds, expecting to see the object appear â€¢ again. But it hadn't appeared after about thirty seconds. So I waited some more. The Russian- French battle was really heating up...and I was getting nervous, still 12 waiting for the reappearance. DISAPPEARS I began to worry. I looked at my watch. It read 7:31, and still no object. Could it have disappeared? Finally it reappeared, considerably smaller in angular size than before. My watch read 7:32. It had taken about a minute and a half to two minutes to change its azimuth by only about 10 degrees, whereas in the previous two minutes (7:28-7:30) it had changed its azimuth by about 60 degrees. Why did it take so long? I decided that it must have changed direction while it was hidden from me and was now heading more eastward. I continued to watch carefully. The direction to the object still moved northward, but very slowly now. In fact, during the last couple of minutes that I could see it, it seemed to maintain a constant azimuth (see map) and a nearly constant elevation. I watched as it shrank to a tiny dot and eventually I could no longer see it against the sky. My watch read 7:35. During the last couple of minutes the object was evidently traveling directly away from me toward the east northeast, since the azimuth didn't change noticeably. It did not seem to be traveling with the (surface) wind, which was from the south southeast, as indicated by the numerous flags that were in the area. Furthermore, since it appeared to maintain a nearly constanf elevation angle during the last couple of minutes, its actual elevation must have increased slightly to compensate for the increased distance. As the object shrank to a barely visible dot I compared it to a distant bird. The bird was so far away that its body appeared as an unresolved black dot against the sky. But I knew it was a bird because I could see the effect of the wings flapping. At its closest the angular size of the object had been much greater than the angular size of this bird. So why hadn't I been able to see any details of the object? I wished I had run for my binoculars. In thinking about the sighting afterward I realized that there was a second reason for running for the binoculars: I would have changed my position on the ground enough to give myself a baseline for a crude estimate of the altitude of the object. After the concert was over Christine and I left the Inner Harbor and drove to her parents' house in a suburb of Baltimore.. While there I wrote down what I could remember of the sighting, made sketches of the object, asked Christine to do the same, and called a radio station (WBAL) to find out if they had had any other reports. They didn't have any reports, but I wasn't surprised. The \"black hole\" didn't do anything spectacular. It just traveled at an apparently constant rate over the Inner Harbor. It made no noise, so far as I could tell, that would attract attention to it. I expect that people who did notice it thought it was peculiar, but. then ignored it. Had it been a silvery disc glinting in the sunset as it traveled along I'm sure it would have been reported by hundreds of people. But this object was just not \"flashy.\" Its major peculiarity was its blackness. It was of such a small angular size (at least from my location) that it posed no apparent threat to anyone. It just shouldn't have been there...or anywhere, but probably most of the witnesses didn't realize that. The following report is based on my notes made 1.5 hours after the event and upon supplementary experiments that were done to estimate my visual acuity.

Some of the most spectacular and widely witnessed UFO apparitions in South America have been caused by entirely prosaic (if genuinely extraterrestrial!) space flight events. The flying saucer fantasy would seems to be what the newspapers (and most of the public) seem most interested in, so recent attempts to communicate the true causes of such sightings have not met with much success. The latest such events occurred on the evening of March 16 and July 3 of 1984. Press reports spoke of \"plativolo (flying saucer)\" visitations over a dozen provinces of Argentina, as well as areas in Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. But the UFOs were actually as tenuous as a cloud of gas in outer space - which is exactly what they were. SOVIET SATELLITES Many Soviet satellites launched from the Plesetsk space center (north of Moscow) are often bound for a special elongated 12-hour orbit with its high point over the northern hemisphere. To get there, the vehicles must first go into a low parking orbit and then, an hour after launching, they fire a fourth stage rocket to push the payload onto its final orbit. Because of geographic factors, these rocket firings take place over the southeastern Pacific Ocean, just off the coast of southern Chile, as the satellite is orbiting in a northeastwards direction. After the firing, the rocket expels excess fuel which briefly creates a gas cloud several tens of kilometers across. Such orbits range from 600 to 40,000 kilometers in altitude, and have inclinations to the equator of about 63 degrees. Two main types of satellites use such orbits: \"Molniya\" communications satellites (most of which are launched from Plesetsk, with a few launched from Tyuratam in Central Asia), and \"Missile Early Warning (MEW)\" payloads which are labeled as part of the catch-all \"Kosmos\" satellite program. There are nine active MEW-Kosmos satellites orbiting one after the other in a formation called a \"constellation\"; Molniya satellites are arranged in two constellations, designated \"Molniya-1\" (eight payloads) and \"Molniya-3\" (four payloads).   â€¢â€¢ AVERAGE LAUNCH On the average, such launchings take place about once a month, to replace on-station satellites which break down or exhaust their manuevering fuel supplies. The shots occur randomly throughout the 24- hour day. If the overflight happens to take place soon after sunset in southern South America, the orbiting gas cloud (and space vehicle, plus booster, plus fragments of protective covers) is lit by the recently set sun while the sky is dark for observers on the ground. The resulting apparition, a cloud- like circular mass with a darker center, is several times the size of the moon, flying about 20 degrees above the western horizon; it crosses the sky in only a few minutes. Sometimes small pinpoints of light accompany the cloud; occasionally, the actual rocket firing will be visible as a yellow \"V\" pointed northwards. at 10pm at 9pm at 10pm 1978 1980 1980 1981 1982 1982 1983 1984 1984 Aug Feb Jun Oct Mar May Aug Mar Jul 22 11 14 31 23 28 30 16 03 at at 8pm 9pm at 10pm 8pm at TWILIGHT ZONE Of the more than 150 such launchings since 1970, about a dozen fit into this \"twilight zone\" of visibility in the early evening (there is no corresponding morning visibility because the cloud is so far down in the western sky). In the past six years alone, there have been nine launchings which happen to fall into this category, and every one of them set off spectacular \"UFO encounters\" (See table.) All kinds of traditional UFO perceptions were sparked by these apparitions. Eyewitnesses described bizarre motion (including turns, stops ' and starts, chases, rising from the sea, \"nearly landing\", rapid recession), electromagnetic effects (radar blips, television and other electrical appliance failures), psychological effects (drowsiness, fear, \"time lapses\", telepathic messages); there was even at least one Close Encounter of the Third Kind, when a witness claimed an alien creature from the UFO (actually, Kosmos-1317) visited him and talked with him. There was. one difference from, more \"traditional\" UFOs: the plethora of photographs by independent witnesses.

Such high-quality, multi-witness photo- graphic evidence is notably absent from \"real\" UFO encounters. PSEUDO-UFOS The connection between such pseudo-UFOs and Russian space shots was discovered and documented by myself, as part of the investigation of the spectacular June 14, 1980, apparition. That case had been written up as a genuine UFO in a late 1980 issue of The International UFO Reporter, published by Dr. J. Allen Hynek's Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois (which has yet to publish the solution). The conclusions of my own research were written up for an article in FATE magazine, which subsequently formed a chapter in my book on space age folklore, The Great Galactic Ghoul and Other Space Legends, scheduled . for publication this year. Several South American ufologists cooperated on the research and did extensive work to uncover many of the cases. They include Dr. Wily Smith of CUFOS, Antonio Huneeus, and Alejandro Chionetti. Their research is continuing and new insights can be expected. They have eagerly accepted the actual cause of the cases and are enthusiastically seeking additional eyewitness reports. â€ž In the future, more such pseudo- UFOs can be expected to be seen on a regular basis. Obtaining tracking data which is needed to determine the exact launch time of such vehicles is difficult. As a rule of thumb, however, whenever such cloud-like UFOs are reported moving south to north in the western sky of Chile and Argentina soon after sunset, and TASS news agency in Moscow later announces the launch of a satellite with the tell-tale orbital parameters, it will be entirely reasonable to associate the two events and, as a first approximation, consider the case \"solved\". PERIPHERAL DETAILS Yet what about the testimony of TJOST LOVE AUErt jOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SPACE MOVIES oooooooooo oooooo o o o strange motion, radio interference, and so forth, which cannot be explained by a sunlit fuel cloud? Dr. Donald Menzei, a leading astronomer and UFO skeptic of the 1950s, had a recipe for processing such \"data\": \"Throw it in the wastebasket,\" he snorted. That may be too harsh, since the South American experience has shown that UFO reports are indeed worth examining closely, precisely because they may not be.caused by \"true UFOs\". But it is an accurate assessment of the reliability of such descriptions. Indeed the very existence of such testimony, caused by a prosaic stimulus, is a powerful skeptical argument that the existence of similar testimony elsewhere does not prove the need for some sort of truly extraordinary stimulus - there need not be any.\"true UFOs\" out there to cause all kinds of \"UFO reports\". Meanwhile, for the South Ameri- can public and its OVNImania, or \"uforia\", the topic is so popular and exciting that the truth may never catch up. 14 Support National UFO Week 18-25 August 1985 Inform Yourself- Inform Others!"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CURRENT ITALIAN SCENE -by Edoardo Russo 1984 was not such a quiet year for Italian ufology. As for UFO reports, it was not rich, but media coverage and research activities did show a consistent increase. UFO/IFO REPORTS Eighty-five (85) sightings have been filed by Centre Ufologico Nazionale as of January 25, 1985. There were 269 in 1980, 80 in 1981, 24 in 1982, and 212 in 1983. Most of the 1984 reports were NL in type. The only cases really interesting are two CE-II/III which incidentally took place a few hours from each other on October 9th. At 3:30 a.m., a housekeeper in Polcanto, near Florence, was awakened by a light coming from the window, and saw for some instant a dark human shape upon a nearby hill, from whose forehead a torch-like beam was coming. It disappeared and a dark horizontal line remained visible under which three flames descended towards the ground. After some minutes, it disappeared suddenly and a great blinding white light began approaching, illuminating all the area like daylight. The witness tried to get to the window but was partially paralyzed before arriving. It looked like the light was sucked back. A red sphere appeared then, the intermittent light of which harmed his eyes; they remained red and irritated for some days. Three circular holes, 10 cms. in diameter, 3 cms. in depth, in a 2 mt. irregular triangle, were found in the area, where the 'grass looked pressed. No radioactivity was recorded. The dog, sleeping outside, did not bark and showed unusual behavior, refusing food for some days, remaining inside his bed for the next two weeks without barking at strangers. The most complete investigation report on this event is by Pier Luigi Sani. At 7:30 a.m. on the same day, a peasant in Prata Principato, near Avellino, watched a 1.30 mt.-tall man in a brown \"space-suit\" with a helmet connected to a rucksack by two pipes, holding a forked stick in his hand, and hovering above the ground emitting blue sparks to a \"space-craft\" which took off at once. Six conical holes in a rectangle, plus two large traces and some footsteps were found in place by C.U.N. investigator Umberto Telarico. Traces remained hotter than the environment for two days and intrigued Carabinieri investigators. FEBRUARY FLAP Local flaps were recorded in the Northeastern provinces of Veneto, Friuli and Trentino in February, when hovering lights were seen and heard \"humming\" by many. These same areas and Northwestern Italy (Piemonte, Liguria) were repeatedly overflown by glowing lights with long trails in early December. On December 5, at 11:30 a.m. in full daylight, hundreds of people in the provinces of Cuneo, Imperia, Savona and Geneva noticed a very bright oblong shape arriving from France followed by a luminous trail, and exploding with such a flash that people inside houses ran out. A loud series of \"booms\" was heard by tens of thousands of inhabitants all over the region and even recorded by the seismographic network. A dark cloud remained in place for more than half an hour. RESEARCH CONTINUES Three on-going projects producing results in 1984 have been: 1. Regional Catalogues of reports, developed by local investigators, which resulted in a complete filing (and publication of a Catalogue) of Italian 1980-1984 UFO/IFO sightings in an \"open\" Data Bank, operated by Gian Paolo Grassino in Turin. 2. \"Project Italy 3\", about Italian CE- III's: a complete list of all reports and sources on such cases was completed by Paolo Fiorino.

MASS MEDIA In 1984, C.U.N. collected 450 newsclippings about UFOs in Italian newspapers,'with a marked increase over the 1981-1983 average. Some events particularly evoked press interest and coverage: C.U.N. Congresses in Palermo (January) and Genova (May) and mostly the official request by four Congressmen to the Government (under guidance by C.U.N.) that the Ministry of Defense open its files to private researchers. The Minister answered that UFO files are actually unclassified and contain no really unidentified reports. C.U.N. Vice-President and foremost Italian field investigator, Antonio Chiumiento, asked the Ministry for details about a UFO-pilot encounter with photographic evidence in 1979, and the Ministry answered that it was just a balloon made of black plastic bags, but released none of the 80 shots. Newspapers, radio and TV devoted ample space to the matter in the second half of the year.

Reports of sporadic UFO sightings in the Soviet Union and allied eastern bloc nations have periodically percolated through the Iron Curtain. Such reports have usually been greeted with caution by western skeptics like James Oberg of NASA, a member of the Scientific Committee of Investigations of Claims of the Paranormal (SCICOP). Oberg, author of Red Star in Orb/f, a study, of the propaganda peccadilloes of the Russian space program, has maintained in the past that Soviet UFO reports were manipulated as a sort of safety valve. They were officially discouraged on one hand, according to Oberg, and ostensibly allowed on the other in order to draw public attention away from highly visible rocket launches made at the USSR's supersecret northern Cosmodrome, Petrozavodsk. JELLYFISH COSMOS One case in particular involved a \"jellyfish-shaped UFO\" seen over Petrozavodsk,and widely reported in the Soviet and world press. \"There's hardly a doubt in the mind of anyone who looks seriously at the data,\" says Oberg, \"that that, was a launch of Cosmos 955.\" \"If I had to speculate, I would say that the Soviet authorities look upon UFOs as a harmless, intellectual diversion. In other words, you can't be a political dissident, but you can be a UFO dissident and it doesn't hurt.\" More recent developments in the Soviet Union, however, may have their own citizens, like their counterparts here, wondering exactly what to believe and what not to believe about UFOs. In May of last year, a union trade daily, Trud, anounced that a commission had been established to investigate unidentified flying objects. At it's head was former cosmonaut Pavel Popovich. The Commission on Abnormal Atmospheric Phenomena was supposedly formed in response to a \"cigar\"-shaped object reported over Gorky. Interviewed by Trud, Popovich said the flying cigar was seen by air traffic controllers at the Gorky airport and picked up on radar. It was said to be about the size of an airliner, but without wings or tail. The object was about 3000 feet high and traveling at a speed of between 110 to 125 miles per hour. Reportedly, it failed to respond to attempts at radio contact. It was tracked by radar for some 40 minutes, passing north of Gorky and 250 miles east of Moscow. The previous December, a bright sphere followed by several smaller lights had been spotted over Byelorussia and the central part of the country. Popovich said that after exhaustive analysis that UFO had definitely been explained as a satelitte burning up on re-entry. STRANGE STAR But in January of this year Trud was again reporting UFOs over the Sovet Union. Crew and passengers aboard an Aeroflot flight from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi to Talinn in Estonia, supposedly saw \"what appeared to be a large, unblinking star\" pace their aircraft near Minsk. The \"star,\" according to Trud, \"suddenly shed a thin ray of light which fell plumb to the ground\" from an altitude of 25 to 30 miles. \"Ground control at the same time registered splashes on its screens in the same part of air space.\" Co-pilot Gennady Lazurin, who relayed the sighting to Minsk, was at first told that no ground radar control had been made. \"Oh well, they'll be saying we're not normal,\" he was quoted as syaing. All four crew members said they \"could see distinctly everything down in the sector of the ground illuminated by the cone-shaped shaft of light.\" At some point the ray was focused directly on the Aeroflot plane and \"the pilots saw a dazzling white spot surrounded by concentric colored rings.\" The UFO then dashed toward the airliner, leaving a green cloud in its wake. Next it took up position alongside the plane and accompanied it into Minsk \"like an honorary escort,\" Trud said. Nikolai Zheltukhin, corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the deputy chairman of a state commission on unexplained phenomena, said the sighting was \"undoubtedly abnormal.\" â€”DENNIS STACY MUFON AMATEUR RADIO NET EVERY SATURDAY MORNING AT 0800 EST (OR DST) ON 7237 KHz SSB MESSAGE, Continued \"Is there a Key to the UFO Mystery in the Jungle of Amazon?\"; and Adolph Schneider, \"Analysis of Reports about mini-UFOs from all over the World.\" 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"SPEAKERS The UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, host for the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium at the Chase Hotel in St. Louis on June 28, 29, and 30, 1985 has announced the following specific plans for this year's event: The speakers and the titles of their papers are George D.

By Walter N. Webb '   MAY 1985 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, in Taurus, is dimly visible early in the month very low in the west after sunset. It fades into the twilight late in the month, setting only an hour after the sun. .   .    . â€¢ . Saturn, in Libra, reaches a point opposite the sun on the 15th, rising in the ESE at sunset and remaining in the sky until sunrise. The golden planet shines at zero magnitude, unusually bright because its flat rings are opened wide, thus \\  reflecting more light, and also the giant world is closest to earth now. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus once again achieves greatest brilliancy (magnitude -4.2) on the 9th, this time in the morning sky. It still appears low in the east, rising !'/Â£ hours before the sun in midmonth. This brightest of all planets appears near the crescent moon on the 15th. Jupiter, in Capricornus, rises in the east about 1 AM local daylight time in midmonth and is low in the SSE before sunrise. The light yellow planet has brightened to magnitude -2. Saturn, at opposition to the sun, crosses the southern sky and sets in the WSW at sunrise. Meteor Shower: The May or Eta Aquarid meteors, radiating from the Water Jar in Aquarius, attain a peak on the morning of the 4th at a rate of about 20 per hour. Unfortunately, this year the date coincides with a full moon which will severely hamper observations. The meteors are swift and leave very long trails before vanishing. The May Aquarids, lasting from about the 1st to the 8th, are strictly a morning display since their radiant point does not rise until well after midnight. Moon Phases: Full moon-May 4 Last quarter-May 11 New moon-May 19 First quarter-May 27 The Stars: o â‚¬ The Big Dipper swings around the sky's north pole and is poised upside-down this month in its best viewing position of the year. Further, this easily recognized pattern of seven stars serves as a built-in pointer system to other stars. The two western stars of the dipper's bowl point to Polaris the North Star; the two eastern bowl stars point to Regulus, the heart of Leo the Lion; and the bent handle, if extended, curves to bright orange Arcturus (in Bootes) and then continues an equal distance to blue-white Spica (in Virgo). The brightest nocturnal star Sirius now sets in the WSW about 9 AM daylight time in midmonth. Reddish Antares (in Scorpius) rises in the ESE about 9:30, while Vega (in Lyra) is now well up in the NE as dusk ends. * * * Since computers are becoming an essential ingredient and a statistical tool to the resolution of the UFO phenomenon, we will be relating on a regular basis the current progress and utilization of these electronic marvels. The \"bulletin board\" UFO network financed by the Fund for UFO Research has been temporarily placed \"on-hold.\" Bruce Maccabee has recommended COMPUFON to ufologists with computers. For this reason, we have referred our members to the newly established privately operated Compufon directed by Michael D. Hart, 803 - 5th Place S.E., Duvall, WA 98109, telephone (206) 788- 5307). Dale Goudie and Michael Hart have distributed their first public communication titled \"The Compufon Network Newsletter\" Volume I, Number 1, dated March 20,1985 to the MUFON members who had expressed an interest in participating in the computer network; 33 members have assigned a personal I.D. Number for entry into the network and the password. Until the new I.B.M. equipment goes on-line about April 1, 1985, they are using their old Atari equipment at the home of Dale Goudie, in Seattle, Washington, telephone (206) 722-5738. Compufon is not a branch of any other UFO organization, but an entity in itself. They will cooperate with anyone interested in their services. Illobrand von Ludwiger, the Coordinator of the Mutual UFO Network - Central European Section (MUFON-CES), recently reported on their annual MUFON-CES Conference in Osterburken near Heilbronn in West Germany on October 5, 6, and 7, 1984. The speakers and their subjects were Illobrand von Ludwiger, \"How Scientifically is the UFO Researched?\"; K. Brauser, \"The Reliability of Human Perception\"; H.W. Pciniger, \"Reliability of size-estimates and statements about the duration of unexpected events\"; H. Markert, \"New Information about the Suffolk Case\" (Rendlesham Forest); Illobrand, (continued on page 17) 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus The MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium will be held June 28, 29, and 30, 1985, at the Chase Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri, with the challenging theme \"UFO: The Burden of Proof.\" For details concerning speakers, titles of their papers and reservations, please refer to a separate article in this issue of the Journal. Marge Christensen, Director of Public Relations, has announced that August 18-25, 1985, has been designated as \"National UFO Information Week.\" All State and State Section Directors should start making specific plans for public UFO exhibits, showing of UFO video documentaries, .one-day UFO conferences, and a news media blitz as a means of public education to this continuing phenomenon -- the greatest scientific mystery of our time. * * * Robert M. Hendricksen, Jr., Ph.D., a MUFON Consultant in Entomology, has accepted the position of State Director for Delaware replacing Juan J. Magrans who will continue to be the State Section Director for New Castle County. G.D. (Dave) Berryhill, Jr., M.D., State Director for Mississippi, has moved \\from Clarksdale to Dublin where he will engage in Emergency Medicine. His new telephone number is (601) 624- 6653. As State Director, Dave has launched a program to organize Mississippi through membership recruitment, selection of an Assistant State Director, Public Relations Director and additional Section Directors. Jerry L. Sievers, presently the State Section Director for Knox, Daviess and Sullivan Counties, was promoted to the additional responsibility of Assistant State Director for Indiana. Jerry is taking positive strides to strengthen the southern half of Indiana through existing Section Directors. The Unexplained Phenomenon Research Organization (UPRO) is now scheduling monthly meetings. Floyd N. Petri, Jr. is the new State Section Director for Bastrop and Travis Counties in Texas. His civilian law enforcement and military experience are an asset to him in Field Investigations. With the support of MUFON, Floyd is organizing a UFO field investigative team to be known as PULSE (Project UFO Landings, Sightings, and Entities) or simply PRG for Pulse Research Group. * * * Two new members have been added to the MUFON Staff in order to stay abreast of advances in state-of-the- art technology. Michael D. Hart, currently State Section Director for King County in Washington, and Director of the Compufon Network will head up MUFON's Computer Science activities and planning. Mrs. Sandra Prullmann, who has an Associate Degree from San Antonio College in video technolgy is our new Video Technician. One of her first official assignments was the filming of the MUFON Seguin segment of the new one hour MUFON video program titled \"UFOs: A Scientific Engima,\" being produced by Marge Christensen and narrated by Dr. David M. Jacobs. The following. people have confirmed that they will participate in the program: Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Walt Andrus, John Schuessler, Budd Hopkins, Barry Greenwood, Dan Wright, Ray Fowler, and Paul Cerny (or Tom Gates). This video program in both VHS and Beta format will soon be available to State Directors for cable television and public relations programs. Marge and her P.I.P.E. Committee are to be commended for this ambitious project that certainly ranks as a first by any UFO organization. The proposed price is $20.00 for each video cassette. Joseph K. Long, Ph.D. of Plymouth, New Hampshire has joined MUFON as a Consultant in Anthropology. He is a professor at Plymouth State College. We also welcome three new Research Specialists this month. They are Rev. Jerry Doellinger, M. Divinity, of Newton, Iowa in Theology; Pete Bissonnet, Crosby, Texas, in Propulsion Systems; and James S. Hatem, M.A. of Chatsworth, California in Anthropology. * * * The MUFON Amateur Radio Net meets every Saturday morning at 8:00 a.m. EST or daylight savings time on 7237 kilohertz. The Net Control stations are N1JS, WA3QLW, and K8NQN. Another valuable project has been completed by the P.I.P.E. Committee with the announcement by Dan Wright, State Director for Michigan, that two .35 mm slide sets, designed for public information and the second for training field investigators are now available. There are two versions of each set. The set of 50 slides will cost $25.00, while the set of 100 slides will cost $45.00. The package includes printed commentary, slides and slide box. Please order these slide sets directly from Dan Wright, 1502 Marquette, Lansing, MI 48906. These visual aids will fill a much needed void that has been desired for many years. Dr. and Mrs. J. Allen Hynek are now living in their recently purchased home in Scottsdale, Arizona, only a short distance from their Arizona facility known as \"CUFOS WEST,\" located at 6159East Indian SchoolRoad in Scottsdale. The official name of the Arizona facility is \"UFO Phenomenon Research Facility\" to emphasize the fact that one does not really do research on UFOs, but on the UFO phenomenon, the existence of which is undeniable. For further details and operation of CUFOS as an organization, please refer to the International UFO Reporter, January/February 1985 issue. (continued on page 19)"}]
