You can, too, with the proper precautions. by Dennis Stacy I 'd visited Rachel, Nevada, once before, in April of last year, to attend what was billed as \"The Ultimate UFO Seminar\" (MUFON Journal, June, 1993). It wasn't, of course, but we did get to listen to shadow physicist Bob Lazar field questions from the audience, check out the interior of the famous Little A'Le'Inn, and of course climb White Sides Mountain by moonlight, from where we could look down on the \"secret\" base at Groom Lake (aka Area 51), home to the F-l 17A Stealth fighter, the SR-71 high-altitude reconnaissance Blackbird and, if Lazar were to be believed, several alien flying saucers now in Air Force possession and al- legedly in process of being \"reverse engineered.\" In the year and a half since then, much water has flown into Groom Lake. Glen Campbell, in particular, set up shop in Rachel and turned his trailer home into a sort of civilian spy shop on the edge of the Air Force's most treasured base of covert operations, where he proved to be a prickly pear in the military's public rela- tions (and operational) behind. The media, from \"48 Hours\" to The New York Times, including many lesser stops in between, soon began trooping to Campbell's aluminum side door in droves. Campbell found a less strenuous overlook of Groom Lake which he dubbed Freedom Ridge. The Air Force countered by asking permission to withdraw same and some 4900 other acres, including White Sides, from public access, that is, incorporating it as part of the vast Restricted Zone com- prising part of the already existing Nellis Gunnery and Bomb Range. Then, sometime in September of this year, I learned, via MUFON member Bob Bletchman, that Larry King would be taking his travelling talk show on the road to Rachel, as one of his twice annual specials for Ted Turner's TNT cable network. A two-hour, call-in pro- gram scheduled for airing on Saturday, October first, \"Larry King Live From Area 51\" would feature live interviews with onstage guests Kevin Randle, Stanton Friedman, Steven Greer and Glenn Campbell, as well as previously taped segments with Carl Sagan, Jacques Vallee, former senator Barry Goldwater and others. Along with the fact that the Air Force seizure of Freedom Ridge seemed imminent, the fact that a Larry King production would be taking place seemed reason enough to revisit Rachel once again. In Las Vegas, I met up with Greg Bishop, editor of The Excluded Middle, and another friend of his, fellow LA writer Scott Sawyer, for the three-hour drive to iso- lated Rachel, normal weekend population approximately 100. I'd already talked by phone with the segment's producer, Tom Farmer, and been assured that we would have some kind of access to the set itself, although he couldn't guarantee an interview with Larry himself. Since the program was scheduled to air at 8 p.m. on the East Coast, that meant it would actually begin in Rachel at 5 p.m. About an hour before show time, we ar- rived in town simultaneously with the limousine driving Mssrs. Friedman, Randle and Greer up from Vegas. I was somehow under the impression that the King set was either going to be in the Inn itself or across the street, underneath a canvas (circus?) tent, which proved erroneous. It was across Highway 375 opposite the Inn, but the set, half-ringed by microphones, cameras and light banks, was atop a raised dais under a bowl of blue sky with scattered clouds. Although it had rained copi- ously only a day or two before, the production crew's luck held. More foreheads were beaded with sweat than with rain drops in the afternoon Nevada sun. By pro- gram's end, King, who had begun in shirt sleeves and trademark suspenders, would be donning his jacket like most everyone else. Engineers piped a live feed into the Inn and onto an impromptu large-screen TV set up just west of same, which really was inside a canvas tent. While the show was in progress, however, we made a late afternoon run for Freedom Ridge, in which we were frustrated by both time and failing daylight constraints. We did drive down the dirt road leading into Groom Lake—passing at least one obvious roadside sensor—until we reached the warning signs, where we turned around and stopped. Clearly visible on a hilltop just to our north sat a security vehicle, its occupants outside and observing us with binoculars. It was soon joined by a second vehicle. By the time we returned to Rachel the program had just ended; most participants, crew and speakers alike, were retiring to the Little A'le'Inn for a,buffet dinner and liquid libation before tackling the drive back to Vegas. S omewhat to my surprise, prior to broadcast, Larry King emerged from one of the production trailers at our request, showed us around the set, and granted us an interview. He looked fit and relaxed, and was com- pletely cooperative, giving off very little of any air that implies \"I'm Chevy Chase and you're not.\" All three of us asked questions at one time or another. I began with the obvious: \"What's your general opinion on the sub- ject?\" \"To tell you the truth, I have no idea,\" King said. \"So you've never seen one yourself?\" NOVEMBER 1994 NUMBER 319 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"Do you think Clinton might make a move in that direction?\" I asked, referring to the recent release of previously unclas- sified documents by the Department of Energy. \"I'm going to talk with him in the next few weeks and I'll ask him. He's always been pretty open. I don't know why he wouldn't. He's anti-secrecy,\" King said. \"No, I saw something one night flying home with the Dolphins,\" King answered. \"I used to do color for the Miami Dolphins. There was this glowing light following our plane about a mile off, at the same altitude. It glowed, and then dimmed and glowed, and we didn't know what it was. We reported it to the ground and they didn't have anything on radar, and it went away in about an hour.\" \"The size of a star?\" I wondered. \"Larger. It wasn't a star. It could have been anything. I talked to Carl Sagan, and he said it could have been a Brazilian aircraft.\" King was unclear as to whether Sagan meant to imply an aircraft smuggling drugs or some sort of off-shore operation in which one plane monitored another's guidance system. But King himself was adamant: \"It wasn't a plane,\" he said. I asked what year it had happened and how could he be sure? King's eyes crinkled. \"It was the 72-73 undefeated season.\" By now we had approached the outdoor studio, bristling with microphone booms, light banks and rail- mounted cameras, Nevada's desert skyline providing the backdrop. Parked nearby were half a dozen hi-tech production trailers out of Los Angeles. \"You couldn't pay for this set,\" Greg Bishop ventured, \"although ob- viously you did.\" \"We paid a lot of money,\" King admitted, sans brag- gadocio. \"The best equipment available. I mean this is TNT.\" Bishop asked how long everybody had been out here and why they chose Rachel? King wasn't curt, but he didn't mince words, either. \"I just arrived,\" he answered. \"The crew got here on Wednesday and the producer picked the site,\" \"That's what Dennis had said,\" Bishop continued. \"How did he convince you to do it?\" \"I do two specials a year for Turner,\" King explained; \"Normally they're taped interviews with sports stars or movie stars. We did this Kennedy thing-in November, on the anniversary of the assassination. We had people on telling where they were at the time, and we had a num- ber of people call in. We got real good ratings on that one. So we wanted to do something else different that was not [just] 'Larry King Live,' or just taped inter- views. So they thought I could come out here. When they first asked me about it, I kind of laughed and said I didn't want to get flown up with the aliens, or whatever. But they said they would talk to Carl Sagan and Goldwater, get some prominent individuals who 'be- lieve,' and set up an 800 number. So the more I thought about it, who isn't interested in this? I mean, you'd have to be dumb not to be interested.\" Noting that live guests Randle, Friedman and Greer could all be considered ardent \"believers,\" or at least en- thusiastic supporters of the UFO phenomenon Bishop wondered who was supposed to represent the skeptical viewpoint? \"The skeptics were invited, the Air Force were in- vited,\" King replied. \"Very hard to get them. You know, I had to really talk to Carl Sagan just to be on tape, be- cause he thinks they [UFO believers] give it credibility just by talking about it. He does not say that there isn't life, he just has no proof that they've ever landed. And the same guy who's always on, the roving skeptic?\" Philip Klass? \"Yeah,\" King said. \"I've had him on so many times. So I guess the skeptic is me. You know, show me! Show me a good photograph, but even there you have to be careful because they can be doctored.\" King seemed much more animated regarding the is- sue of a possible cover-up. \"I abhor secrecy in any form,\" he said, \"unless in the case of extremes, say, when you're at war, experimenting with something like the A-bomb. But now there's no reason. So what if you've got a base there and you're working on a plane that goes 9000 miles an hour and takes off vertically...\" \"Isn't that something you'd want the Russians to know?\" I ask. \"I want them to know,\" King laughs. \"What Russians? That was one of the greatest myths of all time.\" \"So theoretical secrecy only exacerbates the prob- lem,\" I said. \"And if we're not able to keep it secret from the Soviets, who are we keeping it secret from?\" RESTAURANT BAR * MOTEL PAGE 4 NUMBER 319 NOVEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"You only add to the confusion,\" King answered, \"to the conspiratorial theories, by letting things go on.\" \"It's partly out of habit, then,\" Bishop offered. \"Right,\" King said. \"Let's say there is life out there. I think that's something people want to know. If you take it to its wildest extreme, that there is life on another planet that's threatening us and we're dealing with them through their leadership, then that I'd keep a secret. That's the only way. . .there's life out there, they have extraordinary arms, they're mad at Earth, they're going to blow us off the face of the planet, and we've got someone to negotiate with them, then I could say if I were president that it should be kept a secret.\" \"Do you think Clinton might make a move in that di- rection?\" I asked, referring to the recent release of pre- viously unclassified documents by the Department oi Energy. \"I'm going to talk with him in the next few weeks and I'll ask him. He's always been pretty open. I don't know why he wouldn't. He's anti-secrecy,\" King said. Sawyer raised the issue that it was taxpayer money that funded such secrecy, \"yet there's really no oversight of it by the public. Is that something you'll go into to- day?\" \"Absolutely,\" King responded. \"There's no defense of that. There's got to be someone that knows all about this stuff. I mean, they work for us. We don't work for them. Last I checked, the military works for the civilians.\" \"Perhaps you can remind them of that,\" Bishop said. \"They're out there,\" King said, gesturing toward the desert. \"Any secrecy about this is unwarranted if there's no cold war. Who's our enemy? Has Moammar Quaddafi got these kinds of planes?\" O n the way back into Vegas we stopped just south of Rachel at the \"Black Mailbox,\" located in the V of Highway 375 and a dirt road connecting with the road running into Groom Lake. Here we met up with several friends of Bishop's, one of whom had a night vision scope which we passed around while exchanging scut- tlebutt and impressions. A few airplane lights were seen, as well as a couple of car headlights returning from the direction of Groom Lake, a distant ranch light, and at least one or two other interesting light points which seemed to pulsate and jump about. Given the scattered cloud cover, it was hard to make any definite determination of their nature or origin, let alone to assign them the status of true UFOs. Anxious as to our gas situation and the late hour, we said good-bye and headed for nearby Ash Springs, only slightly more removed from the middle of nowhere than Rachel itself. We filled up and were barely a mile south of town when the light bar atop a Lincoln County Sheriff's Department squad car lit up the desert night like a belated Fourth of July celebration. Our rented 4-wheel- drive Blazer didn't have a rear license plate. I pointed out to the officer that it was a new 1995 model and had a 20- day permit attached to the front windshield. He seemed less interested in that legality, however, than in raising county revenues. (According to Campbell, sparsely pop- ulated Lincoln County has one of the highest police of- ficers per capita ratios in the country.) The ensuing scenario, which took a full hour to un- fold, resembled something out of a Steve Martin movie, or perhaps an out-take of \"Late Night with David Letterman\" stupid pet tricks, employing a human as the guinea pig. Before the ordeal was over, two other patrol cars had pulled up, lights flashing, leaving one to ponder just how much of Lincoln County was going unpro- tected at the time. The officers were informed that the driver had indeed been drinking—in fact, he'd had a beer three or four hours previously, prior to dinner, with which he'd had iced tea. But smelling a potential road kill, the officers per- sisted. Unfortunately for Lincoln County's incoming receipts, we passed the ensuing breathalyzer test with fly- ing colors and were soon on our way. registering a mere 0.1. the lowest trace measurement possible, or, as one of- ficer admitted, \"wholly consistent with your story.'' We point this incident out not to brag, and certainly not to ad- vocate drinking while you drive, but only to warn others to be extremely careful when visiting the Rachel, Nevada, area. We have no way of knowing whether our \"friendly\" hilltop observers reported our presence to the local authorities and asked them to \"check that car out\" or not. although we suspect so. What we do know is that we were fully within our rights but were needlessly pulled over and hassled nonetheless. In the latest issue of his on-line digital journal, \"The Desert Rat,\" Campbell also reports being closely ques- tioned by two Lincoln County deputies regarding the re- cent disappearance of eight Air Force sensors guarding the approach to Freedom Ridge, never mind that the lat- ter were on public property supposedly overseen by the Bureau of Land Management. The sensors and their accompanying transmitters are relatively unsophisti- cated as far as state of the art electronic systems go, but Continued on Page 10 NOVEMBER 1994 NUMBER 319 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL WHY ARE THE GRAYS GRAY? Is the color gray a state of being — or a being of some other state? Good-bye little green men. by Martin Kottmeyer W ell, I suppose they have to be some color, don't they? Transparent aliens and invisible entities have been reported, but you know what I mean. They are what they are. Does there need to be a reason? Through the years there have been aliens bearing colors all across the spectrum: black (John Flaxton's bat-winged humanoid, 1963),' white (Bill McGuire's big-eyed grasshoppers, 1969), 2 red (Belo Horizonte, 1963), 3 orange (Brands Flat, Virginia; 1965 ), 4 yellow (Villares del Saz, 1953), 5 green (R.L. Johannis's tiny-striding dwarfs, 1947), 6 blue (Soria abduction, 1978), 7 violet (Margit Mustapa's Space Brother Yuma). 8 Whether one considers the underlying creative mecha- nism as human imagination or alien evolutionary di- versity, the wide range of color exploitation must force one to expect the color gray to have arisen at some point. It might be an essentially random matter that it is currently the dominant color among aliens. Still, it is a question which might reward further thought. On the first level of analysis, gray seems a simple, natural, and fully believable color for an ex- traterrestrial creature. Gray is among the most common colors present in the animal kingdom. Neutral colors help an animal blend into a variety of natural environ- ments and makes visual discrimination by predators more difficult, thus enhancing its ability to survive and reproduce. Bright colors are less frequent in nature. It usually arises in situations where the organism enhances its reproductive success by attracting attention to itself. The major examples are flowers which use insects to disperse pollen. We also see spectacular colors among birds on tropical islands having no major predators. Where camouflage isn't needed, sexual selection plays a larger role in the evolutionary process. Space-faring aliens, as creatures of high technology, would implicitly seem to be no longer subject to selec- tion pressures involving predatipn. Wouldn't sexual se- lection have evolved our space-farers out of such an unappealing and bland color as we see in the Grays? One could argue, given the example of ourselves, that maybe technology was not around long enough for in- teresting genetic variations to appear and dominate. Humans however have developed an arsenal of beauty enhancements involving technology. These include clothing, jewelry, make-up, body paints, tattooing, and cosmetic surgery. Future innovations will almost cer- tainly include nano-tech body resculpturing, gene re- construction, and bio-cybernetic link-ups. Speculations for exobiological coloration can plausibly include iri- descent scales, neon-bright feather-fuzz, hyperimpres- sionist pelts, time-dynamic multi-colored fractal art, and a range of subtle to gaudy creative flourishes de- signed for sensual pleasure or inter-organismic attrac- tion. There may be inscrutible reasons Grays need, want, or are trapped in the forms they have, but, if so, they warrant our pity. It could have been better. The abductee Virginia Horton has probably given us the best clue to what is going on (in Missing Time by Budd Hopkins, pp. 189-90). Regarding her experience, she was struck by the impression \"there was so much gray...it seemed like the gray had a meaning to it, but ei- ther that was the color of the skin or it was a soothing color to their eyes, or something. The gray wasn't an ac- cident or somebody's color judgement.\" The comment about gray being soothing to alien eyes is obviously derived from human experience. It has a numbing or de- pressing effect on ourselves, therefore perhaps on them. Her sense that the color is not accidental, but has mean- ing is more evocative and invites deeper meditation. It seems questionable a human could intuit the presence of meaning of this sort in an alien culture. Horton's remark more probably signals the recognition of a transper- sonal significance rooted in the unconscious. T here are some precedents for humans ascribing a symbolic value to the color gray as can be seen by flipping through Faber Birren's history, The Symbolism of Color (Citadel, 1988). In ancient Jewish mysticism, the gray globe of the Sephiroth Tree of the Cabala, the Chokmah, stood for Wisdom. The Chokmah was linked with the globes of the Crown, the white globe, and Understanding, the black globe, and Mercy, the blue globe. In early Christianity, gray was an emblem of Christ risen, a blend of the divine light of creation and the darkness of sin and death. In astrology, gray is the color of Aquarius. A child born under the sign is peace- able like gray, cursed to dwell in gray and moderate circumstances, blessed by a gray temperament, knowing neither white ecstasy or black despair. The occultist C.W. Leadbeater regarded gray as associated with de- pression and fear. Walter Kilmer's aura studies sug- gested the grayer colors were typical of diseased bodies and duller intellects. The gray alchemical spirit of lead caused madness. Though some of these symbolisms are contradictory and culturally embedded, they do seem to demonstrate meanings constructed from blends of black and white color symbolisms and from visceral physio- logical response. All of us know from westerns that bad guys wear the black hats and good guys wear the white hats.

This fear is particularly intense in dark woods where even relatively fearless adults will, so to speak, get the willies. good; black = evil. The equation is sometimes derided as simplistic, but it is one recognized by all on a deeper lev- el of mind. It is neither uniquely modern or American, but is seen in the beliefs of earliest civilization and across all known cultures. A fear of night with its cold and concealment of dangers is instinctive in many ani- mals for obvious survival reasons. The fear of the dark arises in almost all children after the age of three and chil- dren in different cultures imagine the same sort of mon- sters populating that darkness. This fear is particularly in- tense in dark woods where even relatively fearless adults will, so to speak, get the willies. 9 This fear generalizes into a universal affective dichotomy between light and dark with arrays of concepts grouping themselves into two broad sets of psychological associations. day sun, light white heat, fire life health fertility beauty superiority good holiness divinity virtue truth right wisdom high heaven purity perfume gold night darkness black cold death disease pestilence ugliness, witch, left-handedness inferiority bad dreariness devil, snake, dragon evil, fiend falsehood wrong ignorance low hell impurity noxious odors filth With minor exceptions, these associations lead to similar combinations of traits in the beliefs and myths of cultures as diverse as Europe and the Orient, the Norse and the Negroes, Hindus and Amerindians. It has been seen in at least twenty cultures by one tally. One of the curious practical consequences of this conceptual di- chotomy are stereotypical beliefs about light-skinned and dark-skinned peoples not just in myth, but in every- day behavior. There has appeared many beautification practices which try to lighten skin and hair in what Roderic Gorney has termed the Quest for Blondness. The irrational adulation of white people in myth pre- disposed not only the Aztecs to fall victim to European conquest, but the Boshongoes of the Belgian Congo and the Magi of the Philippines. 10 If the Grays conform to this transpersonal realm of emotions, one should probably predict they would blend the traits of light and dark in conformity to what we saw in Birren. Abductions generally take place at night, but saucer interiors recall the times of dusk and dawn. The lighting ranges from bright to dim, but with narrow band of colors—pale, soft gray, pearly, bluish—far away from white incandescence or black night. The lighting is diffuse and without visible source.\" On average the in- teriors are cool with fogs and mists often reported. 12 It is eerily quiet. 13 T he Grays do not possess a robust constitution and create babies that are listless and wan. \"It is lifeless, yet it is not dead.\" 13 They are sexually neuter, but still reproduce. In terms of beauty, they would certainly de- serve the labels of geek and blind-date nightmare, but they can't be considered predatory or monstrous. They don't have fangs, muscle mass, and one never sees warts or blemishes, or other imperfections. 14 Their goodness and badness are equally denied. 15 They are probably indifferent to humanity. 16 While they are capable of the blackest evils, it is done for the noblest of purposes—saving a dying planet. It could be either theirs or ours, depending on which account you listen to. On the matter of truth, aliens are evasive and deceptive in the sense of trying to hide their activities from us. Malicious or hateful lies aren't evident. Mentally, they are said to be neither pur superiors or inferiors, they are just \"very different.\" 17 Saucer life is not obviously heav- enly or hellish. There is no evidence of humor or fun or entertainment. Anger, sadism, or ceaseless punishment is similarly absent. They smell neither of perfume or noxious gasses. Strieber spoke of a slight scent of card- board, a slight organic sourness, and a subtle overtone of cinnamon. 18 Virginia Horton spoke of a clean, ozone smell to the craft. 19 Probably the only point on which there is no obvious blending is the appearance of serpent insignias on alien uniforms. I can account for it in terms of the origin and influence of the Herb Schirmer story, but I won't bother making excuses here, since nobody said the affective dichotomy is an iron law of the transpersonal realm. It is instructive to compare this tree of psychological associations to the contactee lore of the Fifties. The dominant skin color was indicated by the recurrent phrase of \"fair complexions.\" Variations were numerous, but had a habit of sounding resplendent: faint rosy tinges (George Adamski), 20 soft smooth olive (Adamski), 21 sil- very opaque like carved marble (Truman Bethurum), 22 NOVEMBER 1994 NUMBER 319 PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL fragile transparent camellia-like skin with pinkish un- dertones (Howard Menger), 23 high bronze tint (Mitchell sisters), 24 suntanned (Reinhold Schmidt), 25 a deep tan (Cedric Allingham). 26 These were people who hailed from Utopias, or as the Millers' contact Esu put it, a \"Perfect world.\" 27 These contacts tended to happen in the daytime. In the Scout-craft of the Adamski story a bright coil illuminated the interior with a spectrum of colors \"like a flashing prism in the sun.\" 28 Angelucci reported a brilliantly lit interior \"iridescent with exquisite colors.\" 29 Bethurum was startled by the brilliance inside \"as light as day,\" although with no evident lighting fixtures.\" 30 A craft projected rays at Howard Menger which felt warm and rather good. 31 These are beings of the day and light. They were invariably in good health and were usually indescribably beautiful. They were sexually attractive in a pure and never vulgar sense. They were our superiors not just technologically, but spiritually and morally. There was never a question of their higher knowledge. They often spoke of Deity. Adamski saw. his portrait in one craft and was told it was symbolic of Ageless Life. 32 They enjoyed good food, good drink, and liked to dance. Music was prominently present in several contacts. The crafts were lavish compared to nowadays with all sorts of comfortable furnishings. When Angelucci's contact, Lyra, vanishes \"an exquisite fragrance is left permeating the air as if bowers of invisible flowers were every- where.\" 33 Gold appears in Angelucci's account as a belt he finds himself wearing.' 4 In Adamski, it is the color of the cloth of a banquet table. 35 The total portrait could not be more different both in affect and in the particulars from the Grays' realm. It is strongly driven by the Quest for Blondness, in a manner of speaking. ' Above this instinctual transpersonal foundation of light/dark blending, there is another group of gray as- sociations which may be modulating gray mythology. Gray seems viscerally depressing. It a color devoid of stimulation and passion. It seems joyless, bloodless, unsensual, and business-like. Certainly it seems totally appropriate for a creature that shows no emotions. The absence of decorative schemes or anything to indicate an ability to enjoy art, music, or gourmet-dining under- score their absence of feeling or an ability to be stimu- lated. Indeed, they lack the sense organs of smelling and hearing. The lips have been reduced to unkissable lines. The absence of a tillable belly suggests an inability to taste as well. The Gray's fabled absence of sexual or- gans, cloned neuters, signals the absence of anything that Grays can stimulate or be stimulated by. The prepubes- cent absence of feminine curves or masculine bulges and hair blends a denial of the pleasures of mating and courtship and raw sexual lust. The only things accented on the Grays are the eyes, vision being the most abstract of the senses, and the brain. Just what they need, an ex- cess of gray matter. In their need to revitalize their decrepit con- stitutions and monochrome lifestyles by stealing the essences of humankind, the Grays are fundamentally no different than the undead of literature and film like vam- pires. Appropriately, we are told they come from a dying world. G rayness is also symptomatic of aging, sickliness, and death. Peter Rogerson has already pointed out how everything about the Grays implies the realm of the dead. They skirt virtually every characteristic of life beyond movement; they don't feel, breathe, eat, defe- cate, or copulate. 36 In their need to revitalize their de- crepit constitutions and monochrome lifestyles by steal- ing the essences of humankind, they are fundamentally no different than the undead of literature and film like vampires. Appropriately, we are told they come from a dying world. 37 Yet another strata of associations is provided by the rise of environmental activism in the past few decades and the emergence of a color dialectic of green vs. gray. Green symbolizes fertile nature while gray symbolizes encroaching technology. Gray here is the color of ma- chinery and metals. It is the color of pollutants like smog and lead. An absence of environmental awareness will eventually lead to a world paved over with concrete with all trees gone; techno-apocalypse rendered in the Final Color. Grays are the business-like, perfecto-ob- jective products of high-tech. The nerd-like absence of muscles conveys the over-reliance on machine. Their pain-filled operations and indignities are the reductio ad absurdum of ongoing trends in medical intrusiveness, fertility research, and experimentation for the sake of ex- perimentation. As a colleague of mine put it, \"The aliens and their soulless techno-frek activities make them out to be symbolic little Zeitgeisters who do their many little abductions, just as the gray world of science and tech- nology has done its one big abduction of us all.\" 38 Grays do as Gray is. The ability to relate so many aspects of abduction sto- ries to transpersonal forces (a la Grof 9 ) could never constitute a rigorous disproof of the reality of the Grays, but it should be granted that this is the sort of pattern one should expect to find if we are dealing with dreams and products of the dramatic imagination. There is prob- ably some degree of feedback looping over time. The color gray causes some traits to arise while these traits yield associated traits which in turn act to cause the color gray to arise in later stories. Deciding if we make the aliens gray because of what we have them do or we make them do what they do because they are gray, could turn out to be one of those chicken and egg ques- PAGE8 NUMBER 319 NOVEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL tions. One can however make a stab at it by trying to find the beginning of the tradition. None of the contactee cases of the Fifties seemed to involve gray-skinned beings. Certain little-known en- counter cases involved this color. The Loveland case of 1955 seems the most detailed account. They were ugly things with a frog mouth, rolls of fat on a bald pate, and normal eyes without eyebrows. The upper torso sported a lopsided bulge and uneven arms. It would be hard to fit this into the lineage of present day Grays in a plausible way. 40 The Sixties provide us with a more reasonable and obvious point of origin. That is the first great abduction. The Interrupted Journey of Betty and Barney Hill. Betty's nightmares after Barney's fearful ufo sighting construct men whose \"'complexions were of a gray tone; like a gray paint with a black base.\" 41 The fact that the Hills were a bi-racial couple may be relevant to why they stand at the creation of this tradition. The contactees of the Fifties were white folk and it is safe to say they visualized their alien contacts in the mir- ror of their particular backgrounds and ideals. Black aliens were sometimes passingly mentioned or implied, for example, the stories of Howard Menger, Dino Kraspedon, Buck Nelson, the Stanford brothers, and Gabriel Green, but they never were fleshed out as char- acters. They existed merely to decorate their Utopias with the trait of racial harmony and to demonstrate their spiritually liberal sensibilities by expressing attitudes like \"the soul is beautiful under the skin regardless of its physical shell\" 42 and \"Nature reveals her unity in di- versity.\" 43 They were nameless and abstract. The matter of the Hills' captors being either black or white would not have been so abstract a concern for an interracial re- lationship. There would be an intimate emotional un- dertone had Betty conceived of her abductors as either black or white. Choose white and you could be seen as reinforcing racist stereotypes of whites as a master race with superior intellect and technological skill. Choose black and you might reinforce stereotypes of blacks as criminal, evil, and sexually aggressive. The choice of gray would represent a compromise so- lution. Think here of a moment in Ursula K. LeGuin's The Lathe of Heaven (either the book or the PBS movie). A fellow whose dreams have the power to alter reality is commanded by his therapist to dream of a world where there would be no more color problems, no questions of race. He was in a relationship with a girl of African lineage having dark, amber brown skin, so he couldn't simply eliminate one race or turn one unequally into the other. The doctor envisaged the dreamer would come up with a political or ethical solution. Instead, when he woke up, everybody had turned gray. This prompted the therapist to remark, \"Your primary think- ing processes took the usual short cut.\" 44 It's not unlikely Betty's primary process followed the same short cut. Zebra-striped people might have served the same purpose. People familiar with the often reproduced Olivia painting of the Zebra Lady would have to agree this would have been an aesthetically superior solution. Betty Hill however had read Keyhoe's book The Flying Saucer Conspiracy before she had her dreams. Keyhoe blocked that road by mentioning an earlier case of a ze- bra-striped man and labelling it weird and \"obviously in- spired by excitement or hysteria.\" 45 K eyhoe's book certainly shaped her account in other particulars as has been detailed elsewhere. 46 Subtler forces may have contributed to the choice of the gray for her captors. Keyhoe proposed aliens were possibly studying us out of neutral curiosity and there is ambient hint of a military mentality to the actions of Keyhoe's aliens. Betty's captors, overall, fit the part. She dresses them in trousers and short jackets with a light navy blue color with a gray shade to it. They wear military caps similar to the Air Force, but not so broad on top. Shoes were a low slip-on style, resembling a boot. 47 This is roughly reminiscent of the uniforms of German SS troops, but is more probably intended as a generic foreign invader. Russian cossacks wore gray outfits with blue features and Chinese infantrymen wore blue. American military favored khaki colors and our allies in WW2 did not generally have blues and grays. Her aliens were not Utopian role models, but neither were they horrific monsters. They behaved professionally and business-like when performing their questioning and examination. This befits an expectation of neutral cu- riosity. This is also reinforced by a number of other features in the report. Betty suggests to them they should arrange a quiet, momentous meeting with scientists and the top people of the world as in \"The Day the Earth Stood Still.\" This conveys a sense she does not see them as hostile, irrational enemies, but as foreigners we could exchange thoughts and goods with. Their puzzlement over Barney's dentures and aging parallels Klaatu's innocent wonder at aspects of human life and the entities of \"Earth vs. Flying Saucers\" which had difficulties with our conception of time. This conveys a fallibility and ignorance expected from recent arrivals who just want to check us out. Could it be that a neutral color was chosen unconsciously to match a basically neutral alien? The absence of fair skins and spiritual sermonizing is no surprise given Betty's exposure to Keyhoe. He clearly regarded the contactees as phonies. 48 In this attitude he was joined by most ufologists of his era. They actively resisted contactee tales and would surely have thrown the Hill story away had there been a whiff of religious metaphysics. The tailoring of the story to Keyhoe's prejudices led to a tentative acceptance. Gradually other abductions followed with a similar coloration, both in skin and affect. There may be other subtle factors that led to the dominance of Grays, contingencies like the NOVEMBER 1994 NUMBER 319 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Morton case and Hopkins' popularity, Strieber, Bennewitz, cultural anxieties over modern medicine, technology and the environment, and so forth. These however need not be explored here, our question after all has been answered. They are Gray because that's what they needed to be. NOTES 1. Bowen, Charles, ed.

KING - Continued from Page 5 the Air Force is apparently valuing them at $4-6000, making their theft a felony and punishable by a sizable jail sentence. I don't mean to make more of the situation, especially the increased police activity leading into and out of Rachel, than the situation warrants. I seriously doubt, for example, that the Air Force has any secret saucers se- questered away at Area 51. On the other hand, their of- ficial denials that they have some relatively hot-shot terrestrial technology closely resembling same—the much-rumored Aurora platform seems the most likely candidate—seem somewhat disingenuous in light of the proposed land grab and mounting police patrols out for a buck. On the most obvious level, if they don't have anything to cover-up, then what is it exactly that they are trying to not cover-up? Larry King trucking out to Rachel for the weekend certainly didn't resolve the issue. But it does indicate that the local authorities are getting increasingly sensi- tive about something, and growing less patient by the day with cascading media attention. That they wouldn't pull King over and administer a breathalyzer test seems obvious. That they won't pull you over seems less cer- tain. PAGE 10 NUMBER 3)9 NOVEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"WATER SPOUT\" UFO PHOTOGRAPHED Case reports and photographs — many by Ed Walters — continue to pour in from Gulf Breeze, Florida. by Bruce Maccabee A t about 3:30 p.m. on Tuesday, April 26, Ed Walters called me to say that he had seen the same UFO that he had first seen on November 23, 1993, and again on January 12, 1994. The January sighting has been described previously (MUFON Journal, June, 1994) This paper reports on the November and April sightings. The November sighting began about 4:35 p.m. as Ed was working in his office which has windows that look northward over the Santa Rosa Sound. During the previous two weeks he had seen UFOs in the skies sev- eral time while traveling in the vicinity of Gulf Breeze and from his office. On the 15th, 18th and 21st he had video-taped them with his Sony camcorder, which has a fixed lens (no zoom capability), but the images were too small for analysis. (He also videotaped a UFO on November 28 while standing on the beach. This video is similar to the Martin Allen video (see the December, 1993 MUFON Journal) in that the UFO suddenly dis- appeared. The image was too small to show details of the shape of the UFO. Because of these previous sightings (Nov. 15, 18, 21), Ed set up an even older videocamera, which, how- ever, has a zoom lens, on a tripod in his office, where he could connect the output of the camera to his VCR. (This videocamera predates the popular \"camcorder\" which has the camera and the recorder together in one box. This older camera requires a separate video recorder.) At about 4:35 p.m. Ed was working in his of- fice while watching the Sally Jesse Raphel (SJR) show on TV when he saw a strange object, which he thought was a UFO, appear in the sky. As quickly as possible he turned on the videocamera. However, the object disap- peared before he could point the camera in its direction. Hence the beginning of the video shows him pointing it in various directions looking for the UFO. (Throughout the video one can hear the TV in the background. At the beginning of the video the TV was transmitting adver- tisements typical of the break in a show at the half- hour point in time. Then the SJR show resumed.) At 30 seconds into the video he stated that he was go- ing to leave the camera running in case it should come back. He resumed his work while watching TV (which can be heard in the background) and was no longer looking out the window. About 40 seconds later, 70 seconds into the video, the object appeared again as a small darkish object at the upper right side of the screen. It traveled in a steady motion downward and to the left, crossing the screen — about 10° of angular distance — in 57 frames of the video which corresponds to 1.9 seconds (at 30 frames/sec). (If it were at the distance of the far shore, 8,000 ft., it traveled at about 200 mph.) Thirteen seconds later Ed said \"Ooop, oop, oop. There it is! Right out there.\" Immediately he began to turn the camera to point it at the UFO. In a few seconds he had it in the center of view of the videocamera. The scenery below the UFO is the shore and horizon line on the north side of the Santa Rosa Sound which also ap- pears in the April 26 photo which is to be described. The image was too small and poorly defined to show any de- tails of shape. However, Ed gave the following descrip- tion of the UFO as he looked through the telephoto lens of his 35 mm camera (no film in the camera!): \"It looks like an egg on the top and an egg on the bottom and ... huh! ... a bunch of ball-like things around the outside.\" The UFO remained motionless until about 2 min. and 55 seconds, at which time it disappeared in one frame (1/30 second). During the last 20 seconds of the video, Ed said he was going to the closet to get some film for the camera. To do so he had to look away from the UFO for several seconds. It was gone when he re- turned to the camera. He did not see it disappear. During the January sighting Ed took two photos with his 35mm camera and telephoto lens. The first photo shows a UFO shaped roughly like a thick plus sign. Unfortunately, the image is too small to show fine de- tails. The second photo, however, shows that the UFO had a round bottom and round or oval objects around its sides, similar to the UFO of November 23. (The view of the upper part and right hand side were blocked by an F- 15 jet that was flying past the UFO; see the June issue of the MUFON Journal.) Ed described the April sighting as follows. He was sitting at his desk working at about 1:00 p.m. He hap- pened to look toward the Sound through the windows in front of him and he noticed a shiny object moving downward through the sky from his left (west). It then slowed and came to a stop at what appeared to be about the treetop level. It hovered or moved very slowly to the left at a low altitude over the water at a location north- northwest of him (336° azimuth). (The direction to the UFO was nearly the same as the direction during the November 23, 1993 sighting but in that case the UFO appeared to be higher than the treetops.) He grabbed his 35mm camera with the telephoto lens but then realized that there was no film in it. He then grabbed his only other camera, a Polaroid Model 600 which he used to take photographs at job sites. It had film. He ran out onto his deck. As he was preparing to take the picture he noticed a lot of disturbance of the wa- NOVEMBER 1994 NUMBER 319 PAGE I I"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Figure J: artist's impression. ter surface (waves, whitecaps, \"chop\") or a mist above the water surface below the UFO. Then he saw a thin line which appeared to be a water spout rising upwards and reaching the bottom of the UFO. He aimed the camera and took the picture. Within a few seconds the \"water spout\" disappeared and then the UFO zipped off to the left, roughly in the direction from whence it came. As Ed pointed out to me, \"It was a beautiful day. There should have been a million boats out there. However there were none at the time of the sighting.\" Later, of course, there were boats going back and forth along the Sound. Since it was a Polaroid photo Ed didn't have to wait for the picture to be developed. He called me up a cou- ple of hours later and described the sighting to me and how the UFO appeared to the naked eye. He said he had looked at the photographic image using a magnifying glass but that he had considerable difficulty in seeing de- tails because the image was small. He told me that the photo seemed to show the water spout as a thin white line extending from the bottom of the UFO to the water. He also said he could see a white area at the water level below the UFO, and also a thin dark line (see Figure 1). He speculated that the white area might be whitecaps or foam and that the dark line might be the shadow of the UFO on the water, since the sun was high at the time. I immediately pointed out that if the supposed shadow, or the white area, were actually on the water surface beneath the UFO then it might be possible to determine the distance to it. I asked him to try to measure the dis- tance between the image of the supposed shadow and the image of the distant shoreline (without realizing just how tiny and blurred these images are!). He attempted to make measurements using a ruler with a 1/60 scale and I attempted to estimate the size of the UFO. Based on his measurements, I estimated its distance at about 8,000 ft. and its width at about 60 ft. Subsequent analysis showed that Ed's measurements were in error by a fraction of a 60th of an inch, which was not surprising considering how small the images are, and that the actual distance and size were about 1/2 of these values. Subsequently Ed mailed me the photo for my analysis. I also sent it to Jeffrey Sainio for his analysis. ANALYSIS The analysis, which was carried out with high quality optical, video and computer-aided analytical equipment, provided the following information. The image is tiny (about 0.90 mm wide) but upon magnification is easily seen as a white object of unusual shape that is silhouet- ted against the trees along the shore on the north side of the Santa Rosa Sound. Figure 1 presents what can best be called an \"artist's impression\" of the UFO since the photo does not have the sharply defined edges which ap- pear in the illustration. However, the overall shape is quite distinct and is well represented in the drawing. The top of the UFO appears to be approximately level with images of the the tops of the distant trees, which are about 80 ft. above the water. Since the camera was only about 13 ft. above the ground this means that the top of the UFO was lower than 80 ft. (The UFO is estimated to have been about halfway across the Sound and since the camera was about 13 ft. above the water, the elevation of the top of the UFO was a bit more than half as high as the treetops. A more accurate estimate is given below.) The upper portions of the UFO image are brighter than the lower portions which is consistent with the so- lar illumination (clear day; solar azimuth 190°;'elevation 75°). The UFO appears to have an elliptical or egg- shaped top surface, an elliptical or spherical bottom surface and a thick, horizontal center portion, as illus- trated in Figure 1. This center portion might consist of numerous small oval or spherical objects similar to the \"outboard fuel tanks\" that appear in the second January 12 photo mentioned above. Unfortunately, the quality of this photo is much poorer than the quality of the January 12 35mm photo and this makes it impossible to dis- cern fine details of the construction of the UFO. There is also a faint but rather thick vertical line that is darker than the rest of the UFO, which crosses the horizontal center section near the right hand side. Starting at the bottom of the central section is a thin white line that ex- tends downward to a position that is clearly below (on the photo) the image of the distant shoreline. This sug- gests that whatever made the thin white line ended at the surface of the water underneath the UFO. The presence of this thin line appears to be consistent with Ed's de- scription of a \"water spout\" that rose up to the bottom of the UFO. Telephoto pictures (220, 440 mm lens) taken from Ed's house and showing the far side of the Sound combined with an onsite investigation by myself proved that there is no structure on the far shoreline or any- where on the Santa Rosa Sound that even remotely re- sembles either the UFO or the thin white vertical line which appears immediately below it. PAGE 12 NUMBER 319 NOVEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL At the left side of the bottom of the \"spout\" is a small, rectangular white area (roughly 0.37 mm hori- zontal by 0.15 mm vertical measure) that is silhouetted against the blue water. The bottom of this white image clearly appears below the level of the distant waterline. That fact suggests that the bottom of this white area is at water level and therefore it could be a mist or foam (whitecaps) extending upward 4 to 6 feet from the water surface. Adjoining the right side of the bottom end of the \"spout\" at about the level of the top of the rectangular white area is a faint, thin horizontal dark line that lies to the right of beneath the center of the UFO. Its length is about 0.1 mm less than the width of the UFO. It appears to be just barely below the level of the distant shoreline. A scan of other portions of the photo showing the distant water did not find any other white areas or dark lines similar to these. Therefore it is possible that this dark line is associated with the presence of the UFO and might actually be the shadow of the UFO on the water surface or the shadow on any mist that might have risen up from the surface as a result of the presence of the UFO. The onsite investigation showed that there are no structures or objects on the distant shore or lying along the line of sight to the shore which resemble either the white area or the dark line. For the purposes of calculation I assume that the white area discussed above was a mist (or foam) below the UFO and, in particular, that the bottom of the white area was at the water surface. The distance from the camera to the white area can be estimated from the fol- lowing measurements: (a) the height of the camera above water level, (b) the distance from the camera to the far shore and (c) the angle (in radians) between the photo- graphic image of the far shore and the image of the bot- tom of the white area. Once the distance to the white area is estimated the approximate size (in ft.) of the UFO can be calculated from the size of the film image by multiplying the distance (in ft.) by the ratio of the image size (in mm) to the focal length of the camera (110 mm). The distance to the far shore has been estimated, using a map, at about 8,000 ft., (+/-) 200 ft. Measurements were made to determine the camera height above the water lev- el at the same tide stage as the time of the photo. The camera height turned out to be 12.5 ft., (+/-) 0.5 ft. Unfortunately it has proven to be quite difficult to accu- rately measure the distance between the image of the shoreline and the bottom of the image of the white area. The difficulty arises from the poor resolution or \"fuzzi- ness\" of images in the Polaroid photo. The fuzziness is a result of two factors: the rather large grain size of Model 600 Polaroid film and imperfect focusing of the lens. Various techniques were used to estimate the shoreline po- sition, including the use of telephoto images of the distant shore for comparison. These measurements indicate that, on the original photo, the distance downward from the shoreline to the bottom of the mist is about 0.146 mm, (+/-) .018 mm which corresponds to an angle of about 0.00133 radians. The uncertainty in this angle leads to an uncertainty of about (+/-) 12% in the estimated distance. The result of the analysis is that the distance to the white \"mist\" is about 4,300 ft., (+/-) 500 ft. (Jeffrey Sainio, another MUFON photoanalyst, used computer- aided techniques to make measurements on the film and he estimated the distance at about 4,200 ft.) Using 4,300 ft. as the distance, the size of the UFO has been calcu- lated from measurements of the image size. The results are, again with a lack of precision because of fuzziness, that the UFO was in the range of 30-38 ft. wide and 20- 27 ft. high. The bottom of the UFO was 19-26 ft. above the water (the length of the \"water spout\") and the top was 45-50 ft. above the water. The thickness of the hor- izontal center section was about 10-15 ft. The thickness (diameter) of the \"water spout\" was only a couple of feet. It is important to note that the lower values of the es- timated size (30 ft. wide by 20 ft. high with the horizontal NOVEMBER 1994 NUMBER 319 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL section 10 ft. high) are very close to the dimensions of the UFO calculated from the January 12 photo of the UFO and the F-15 jet (29 ft. wide by 19 ft. high with the hor- izontal section about 9.5 ft. high). The dimensions cal- culated from the January photo were based on an as- sumed distance of 8,500 ft. (200 ft. farther than the F-15). In that case there was no way of determining just how. far away the UFO was, only that it was farther than the jet. Hence I could have assumed a greater distance. If, for ex- ample, I had assumed 9,000 ft., the calculated dimensions from the \"jet photo\" would have been about 31 ft. by 20 ft. by 10 ft. and therefore in agreement with the minimum size estimated from the \"water spout\" photo. T he above calculations assume that the white area was on the water surface below the UFO and not shaded from the sun by the UFO. This hypothesis can be tested to determine whether or not there is consistency with Ed's description. Consider that the sun (by measure- ment a few days later) was at an elevation of about 75° and at an azimuth of about 190° at the time of the photo. The sun would cast a shadow on the water which was the same size as the UFO. However, because the sun was not directly overhead, the whole shadow would be shifted in a direction away from the azimuth of the sun. Specifically, the shadow would be offset in direction 10° east of north. The amount of offset (distance) would be equal to the product of the altitude of the shading ob- ject, i.e., the altitude of the (center) of the horizontal sec- tion of the UFO, about 36 ft., and the cosine of the solar elevation: 36 cos(75) = 9.3 ft. Since the calculated di- ameter of the UFO was 30-38 ft. (radius =16-19 ft.), di- rect sunlight at the water surface would reach only about 1/2 way from a point directly under the edge of the UFO to a point directly under the center of the UFO (with this measurement made along a line starting at the water surface directly below the center of the UFO and extending \"toward\" the sun). Thus if the UFO created a mist (or foam or whitecaps) on the water surface below it, the \"outer\" portion of that area would be directly il- luminated by the sun. That portion would be, from Ed's perspective, at the left of where the vertical centerline of the UFO contacts the water surface, i.e., at the left of the bottom of the \"water spout.\" That is exactly where the brightest white area appears. In the photo one can see that the left half (approximately) of the \"mist\" area is a bit brighter than the right half (approximately), which is consistent with assuming that the left half of the mist was directly illuminated by the sun and the right half was shaded from the sun and only indirectly illumi- nated (by skylight). The \"water spout\" is also a relatively dim white image, consistent with the fact that it would be shaded from direct sunlight along its whole length. DISCUSSION OF THE HOAX HYPOTHESIS Could this be a hoax photo created by Ed, perhaps to support his previous F-15 UFO photo? I will now dis- cuss that issue. If it were a hoax, he would have had plenty of time to create it and he could have used any camera available. In particular, considering the \"success\" of his hypothetical hoax F-15/UFO photo, he could have used the same 35 mm camera in order to create a truly spectacular \"water spout\" UFO photo. Why switch to the lower quality Polaroid if he were able to create a convincing hoax with a much better camera? To be consistent with his F-15AJFO photo he would want to create another photo in which the apparent size of the \"UFO,\" as calculated from the photo, would equal the size estimated from the F-15/UFO photos, i.e., around 30 ft. wide. : To accomplish this would re- quire some careful photographic calculations on Ed's part and some very careful photography. The size range calculated here (30 ft. to 38 ft. wide) is extremely sen- sitive to the exact location on the photo of the bottom of the image of the white \"mist\" relative to the location of the shoreline. A variation by a small fraction of a mil- limeter up or down on the photo can change the calcu- lated distance, and therefore the calculated size, by a large amount. Hence in evaluating the hoax hypothesis one should ask whether or not Ed could (a) figure out exactly where to place the bottom of the \"mist\" image relative to the image of the distant shore, and (b) having figured that out, could he create a photo showing that mist in the correct location. The only reasonable method to propose, consider- ing the camera he used, would be the direct photograph of a model silhouetted against the background scene or a double exposure. The suggestion that it could be a dou- ble exposure is rejected as being virtually impossible to accomplish with the Model 600 camera. It would ^equire that he position the latent image of a very brightly lit model UFO, with its associated \"water spout\" and \"white mist\" (presumably photographed against a dark background during the first exposure of the film), in such a way as to make it appear as if the bottom of the \"spout\" and the \"mist\" contacted the water at a particu- lar distance from the opposite shoreline. This would be very difficult—perhaps practically impossible—since he couldn't see the location of the latent image within the field of view of the camera and therefore would have to guess as to where to point the camera. Moreover, he could not create, by the simple double exposure method, the dark line which he suggested was a shadow of the UFO. The reason that he could not create the dark line is because it is darker than the back- ground (water), and in a simple double exposure one cannot have any portion of the \"UFO image\" darker than the background. (This is because at any point of a multiple exposure photo the total brightness is the sum of brightnesses during each exposure. Brightnesses can- not subtract from one another.)

Whole group of red objects spotted over Pensacola Beach Dunes Hotel by Shoreline Park skywatchers. Two of the red objects came together to form one. April 28th. At 10:40 p.m., at the intersection of Fairfield and Palafox in Pensacola, a young couple in their 30s were driving when suddenly a round craft the size of a Volkswagen passed right in front of their car and stopped over a house only 50 feet from them and about 50 feet over same. It had red lights going round and round and began to look \"hazy\" inside, as if it were emitting smoke. The wife was very shocked, never hav- ing had a sighting or any interest, although encouraged by her husband. Originally from England, this Pensacola couple, after seeing a UFO up close, now skywatch regularly and are both believers. May 20th. At 2:00 p.m. at the intersection of Cervantes and N Street in Pensacola, close to the Pensacola Grand Hotel, a couple driving spotted two huge oblong-shaped metallic crafts giving off bright lights that he said was not reflective but \"transmitted.\" The soundless objects were 150 feet across, 50 to 75 feet thick, at an altitude of 4000 to 6000 feet. The estimated speed was 200 to 300 mph. When two Navy training jets flew toward them, the crafts disappeared. June 26th. 3:00 p.m. Pensacola Beach Parking Lot #5. Between Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach, two brothers saw, hovering almost directly overhead, three small circular dark grey discs. Two discs were side by side and one was to the right toward the Southeast. The disc off to the right of the other two moved several hundred feet Southeast and back in two seconds. The discs then moved together and appeared to move off in different directions. The sighting lasted about three min- utes and reportedly made the \"hair stand up\" on the witnesses. June 29th. At approximately 9 p.m., a man and woman were walking into Delchamps grocery on Highway 98 in Gulf Breeze when they saw a huge ob- ject over East Bay that started glowing orange. At midnight on the same night, six witnesses re- ported seeing a huge round craft over land between the Gulf waters and the street east of Ariola Drive, near the second beach water tower. It was low and so large it covered up the water tower, displaying a series of lights on it and then shining beams of light down. It started to glow a golden orange and seemed to have a gaseous cloud around it. Mid-July. During the middle of the afternoon, a cou- ple visiting from the Northeast spotted a metallic, conr ventional-shaped UFO over a Pensacola lake. It was in one place, not moving, and wobbled lightly from side to side. Suddenly, three helicopters flew in and the craft left. Several days after they arrived home, two men dri- ving a black Chevrolet reportedly came to their home, demanding the still and video pictures taken of their sightings. They frightened the couple, who are still trau- matized, and took their videos and film. August 16th. Two strange red lights were spotted over the Bob Sykes Bridge leading from Gulf Breeze to Pensacola Beach. Multiple witnesses. August 27th. Midnight. A retired army officer re- ported a low flying \"absolutely huge\" boomerang- shaped object that resembled a half-moon near the en- trance to the Villa Venice subdivision on the edge of the Naval Live Oaks Forest where there have been many Gulf Breeze sightings. The witness and his two daugh- ters described a gaseous cloud forming around the UFO, which was moving North to South and flying further and lower into the subdivision toward the water. They lost sight of it as it disappeared into the trees. The former of- ficer said the object was unlike anything he had ever seen. September 6th. Two sightings from Shoreline Park South, Gulf Breeze. Sighting No. 1: 9:25 p.m. Multiple witnesses ob- served a yellow, rectangular UFO with three red lights on the side. Sighting No. 2: A witness observed an orange and amber-colored, football-shaped light fly low over the pavilion roof at Shoreline Park South. It disappeared into the trees located behind the park. A little before the sighting, the witness and her mother had walked under the pavilion but left quickly because they felt as if \"something\" was there. The mother described the feel- ing as an energy which just \"hit her right in the chest.\" September 7th. Two nurses at a Gulf Breeze medical facility went outside at 2:30 a.m. As they were standing on the back patio area, they saw an amber-colored star which looked strangely different than it \"should.\" Suddenly, it dropped down rapidly, zigzagged wildly NOVEMBER 1994 NUMBER 319 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Two nurses at a Gulf Breeze medical facility saw an amber-colored star which looked strangely different than it \"should.\" Suddenly, it dropped down rapidly, zigzagged wildly several times, and, to their amazement, shot straight up in the air and disappeared. . several times and, to their amazement, shot straight up in the air and disappeared. September 8th. Between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m., twelve red lights were seen in groups of three and four over Pensacola Beach. An orange ring of lights appeared over the Holiday Inn and shortly afterwards, a large or- ange ring with a red boiling center appeared near the same area. September 12th. 7:40 p.m. Three red objects ap- peared over the Dunes Hotel on Pensacola Beach. At 7:50 p.m., one more appeared from which a blue beam could be seen shining perpendicularly toward the ground. The Shoreline Park skywatchers spotted an- other red object which turned amber, then white, at 8:25 p.m. near the foot of the beach bridge. September 24th. Midnight Pensacola Beach sight- ing. A group of witnesses reported seeing four strange balls of light. One was particularly large—the size of a quarter at arm's length. It appeared as a bright ball of or- ange light, much darker in the center. This very intense light flashed off and on several times then suddenly be- gan to change colors from pink to blue to green and move fast and erratically all over the sky. The witnesses stated this bizarre group of light balls was soundless and resembled nothing they had seen before.

MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Seguin, TX 78155-4099 WATER SPOUT - Continued from Page 14 background during the second (background scene) ex- posure, could, in principle, be used to create a dark line, it would be virtually impossible to carry out with this camera because it would require exquisitely fine alignment between the (invisible) latent image of the dark line and the background mask. The angular size (width) of the UFO corresponds to roughly 3 inches at 30 ft. Thus one might suggest that a model, including the \"water spout,\" the white \"mist\" and the dark horizontal line, was hung from threads below some structure that was too high and too wide to appear in the camera. For example, one might imagine using a vertical pole holding a horizontal bar, and the model hung from the bar. At a distance of 30 ft., since the UFO im- age appears near the horizontal center of the photo, in or- der to be outside the picture, the pole would have to be roughly 12 ft. to the left or right of the model and the hor- izontal bar would have to extend at least this distance (12 ft.) to be over the model. At a distance of 30 ft. the hor- izontal bar would have to be at least 6 ft. above'the model in order to appear outside the picture. Since the camera was about 10 ft. above the ground, as proven by scenery in the photo combined with the on-site visit, the hypothetical horizontal bar would have to be at least 16 ft. above the ground... do-able, but not easy. A more bizarre suggestion is that a full-sized model, more than thirty feet in diameter, was supported on a floating plat- form in the middle of the Santa Rosa Sound. Clearly this would be extremely difficult to accomplish and it would require a relatively long time (hours) to set up. Surely many people would have seen such a construction as they traveled past in their boats. As a further test of the model hypothesis I asked Ed to use the same camera to photograph a similar-shaped object hanging from a thread at a distance of about 30 ft. He chose a baseball and hung it so that the top of the ball appeared to be about level with the top of the treeline, just as the top of the UFO appears to be about at the top of the treeline. Jeffrey Sainio has analyzed the water spout photo and compared it with the test photo of the baseball. He found that the edge of the ball image is sharper than the image of the distant shore, which indi- cates that the ball was much closer than the distant shore (which is true). He also found that the edge of the ball image is sharper than that of the UFO image, which indicates that the UFO is much farther away than the ball. Moreover, he found that the sharpness of the edge of the UFO image is similar to that of the image of the distant shore. Both of these latter findings are consistent with the calculations presented above which indicate a distance of thousands of feet to the UFO. Hence, after combining the testimony with the photo analysis I con- clude that this photo is not a hoax. PAGE 16 NUMBER 319 NOVEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"False Memories and Imagination\" W ith the release of Dr. John Mack's book, Abduction, and his many appearances on various television specials and talk shows, the skeptical point of view had to surface with some credible explanation other than what Dr. Mack was offering. The hottest and most recent explanation going around is that of the False Memory Syndrome—which simply means that the subject is imagining his experiences through the collective effects of suggesiive interviewers, iiypnulic trances, subconscious needs, and information of a sci- ence fiction nature already absorbed and present in the unconscious mind. The widely publicized False Memory Syndrome is a very real phenomenon that has been basically associated with stories of people suddenly claiming remembrances of childhood abuse after becoming involved with thera- pists and hypnosis. Careful investigation of such cases has usually revealed carelessness and sloppy, suggestive approaches by enthusiastic and emotionally-involved counselors. Even books contain highly suggestive re- marks such as this quote found in The Courage to Heal: \"If you are unable to remember any specific instances... but still have a feeling that something abusive happened to you, then it probably did... If you think you were abused—and your life shows the symptoms, then you were!\" These kinds of careless suggestions also exist in the UFO field among eager investigators, inexperienced hypnotherapists, and opinionated (therefore suggestive) UFO groups. This can and has lured avid \"believers\" who may have a psychological need to belong and boast an affiliation with UFO contacts. This, however, is quite different from the typical profile of the credible ab- ductee who usually disbelieves initially, remains skep- tical, private, anonymous, and uncertain. What serious researchers and qualified mental health professionals continue to report is that these subjects are not sug- gestible—nor can they be led in logical directions when detailing an experience. They insist on describing bizarre details which make absolutely no sense to them to the extent that they feel they must be going crazy! Yet, their reports match with an uncanny and unprecedented accuracy given the nature of the material. But it is largely assumed by the skeptical element nationwide that all abduction researchers and professionals are care- lessly enthusiastic, sloppy, and highly suggestive. This is simply not true. There are a number of very careful and skillful persons doing excellent work in a quiet and se- rious manner. Subjects have not allowed us to lead them despite the variety of cleverly-worded questions and opinionated remarks thrown at them deliberately. If the subject wanted to please the researcher, he should be led all over the place without much difficulty. But this just is not happening. There have been hypnotherapists and psychologists who knew nothing about UFOs and found accounts pouring out of their clients—sometimes without the client even linking it to the UFO subject himself. Occasionally, different mental health professionals have worked with separate witnesses from the same en- counter—and without comparing notes or expectations found striking matches in specific details between the accounts of these separate witnesses from independent investigations. It is most chilling when they are able to describe what each other was doing while aboard the spacecraft at certain points in the accounts. This is what you will not find with the False Memory Syndrome be- cause the nature of imagination does not work in such a manner that two different people would report the exact same scenario with matching details that place those persons aboard a craft at the same point in time knowing what each other was doing. Imagination is boundless and unlimited, especially with all the various kinds of sci- ence fiction and outer space adventures in the media these days. Imagination could create vague parallels and basic themes that match in general ways, but not in the multitude of specific and minute matching details. F or example, outer space fiction on television pro- vides us presently with a creative array of many images and possible scenarios. Regarding alien com- munication, think how many different types of vocal sounds, bleeps, grunts, screeches, computerized lan- guages and tones of audible voices have been presented to us! Yet, despite that creative and pervasive influ- ence, why do we get a better than 98% correlation among carefully collected accounts of non-verbal, non- audible communication which is essentially telepathic? Why don't we find more interesting descriptions of spacecraft interiors instead of the usual colorless, gray, barren, and drab rooms that lack wallpaper, furniture, hanging pictures, plants, or any sense of decor? Where is the imagination? How could so many people from so many different backgrounds, intellects, experiences, and ethnic influences ever begin to tell the same kind of unimaginative scenario? In fact, it is this absence of imaginative detail that is providing researchers with clearer and more predictable patterns of data. With false memories of sexual abuse an experience between humans is created—a much easier kind of story to fabricate from our own backgrounds and feelings to- ward relatives than one of a bizarre and confusing alien abduction by beings that we have never seen before in our lives. Even though it would be much easier to create a story of human abuse which could be accepted and be- lieved by our society, no two sexual abuse accounts NOVEMBER 1994 NUMBER 319 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL could be that alike over thousands of cases due to the simple fact that this multitude of victims cannot share the same Uncle Ed or Grampa Joe, nor the same indi- vidual backgrounds from all the diverse lives involved. General themes could be similar, but here, specific de- tails related to family tragedies would reflect the difficult life of each individual, presented in a unique and emo- tionally rich tapestry of that individual's life. Because sexual abuse victims are accepted and supported by various groups and treatment centers, it becomes more reinforcing to subconsciously manufacture what the therapist is suggesting. Abductees, on the other hand, comprise \"a club that nobody would want to join or belong to—including those who are already members.\" The lack of qualified help or public support along with demeaning skepticism and intolerable ridicule should theoretically extinguish such a psychological desire. Yet reports continue to flow by the thousands—remi- niscent of the manner in which reporters of incest were initially discredited, disbelieved, and scorned until the sheer weight from the abundance of accounts broke the doubting backbone of society, crushing the wall of pub- lic denial with a flood of credible reports that could no longer be neatly ignored. The False Memory Syndrome attempts to add support to its own crusade by claiming that any and all such ab- duction tales are additional irrefutable evidence that such a process of creating false memories exists. But that is like saying that since a twenty-dollar bill can be coun- terfeited, all twenty-dollar bills are fakes! It could also be said that since false memories can be constructed, no memories should be trusted. But studies by the Los Angeles Police Department of over 500 traumatic crime cases revealed that verifiable data retrieved from hyp- nosis sessions were determined to be accurate 90% of the time—better than that of witnesses with conscious recall. This False Memory crusade can sadly lead to doubt and ridicule of victims who are accurately re- calling instances of human abuse. As researchers we must learn what we can from the False Memory Syndrome in order to make us aware of the pitfalls and dangers of sloppy, suggestive approaches in our investigations and treatment of alleged abductees. The False Memory crusaders need to recognize that the abduction phenomenon cannot be explained nor cate- gorized so quickly with a superficial perusal and com- plete disregard for careful and intelligent research. They need to be able to explain how separate participants are able to \"create\" such matching accounts. They need to account for the lack of imagination and diversity in alien encounters that one should expect over thousands of people. They need to explain how children can report such incidents from the night before. They need to ex- plain how bizarre abduction tales match in intricate de- tail and with greater frequency than the diverse ac- counts of human sexual abuse of which there is more public knowledge and acceptance. They need to allow for the idea that some abduction accounts may be true. And. finally, they need to account for the massive amount of correlating and supporting evidence in the form of documented absences, ground traces, unex- plained incisions and scars, photos, multiple partici- pants, shared amnesia, independent eyewitnesses, radar tracking, radioactivity, burns, affected vegetation, con- scious reports, and government documents recognizing the existence of UFOs at a highly classified level of importance and secrecy. This is indeed more than just imagination or false memories.

Webb Center for UFO Studies, 306 pages, paper, $19.95 Reviewed by Dennis Stacy R eaders of this journal will of course be familiar with the name of Walter Webb. MUFON's Astronomy Consultant, who writes our monthly \"Night Sky\" column. The latter, incidentally, celebrated its 20th anniversary last month. They may be less familiar with the fact that Webb spent 32 years at Boston's Charles Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Science, or that he was the initial investigator of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case. In fact, his interest in UFOs was piqued by a personal sighting in 1951. If you meet him at a conference, then, don't be deceived by his youthful looks: Walter and his brother, David, have been in this business for a combined 60, 70 or maybe even 80 years, which is something few siblings can say. Encounter at Buff Ledge. A UFO Case Hiswry. pub- lished by the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, is his first full-length book and a highly recommended one at that. We were treated to the briefest of sum- maries of this case in the May, 1988, issue of the Journal. At that time, wrote Webb, his \"five-year probe into the incident makes it the most thoroughly investi- gated and documented of any single UFO abduction episode to date.\" Mr. Webb presented this case at the MUFON 1988 International UFO Symposium in Lincoln, Nebraska. PAGE 18 NUMBER 319 NOVEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The case was deemed worthy of such a detailed in- vestigation because of two primary factors. First, it was that rarest form of abduction, one in which two or more people claim to have been abducted simultaneously. (The only other full-length book treatment of a similar case that comes readily to mind is Ray Fowler's The Allagash Abductions, 1993, Wild Flower Press, which involved four campers in Maine.) Perhaps more impor- tantly, noted Webb, \"I was able to determine that neither individual saw, spoke, or corresponded with the other over the 10-year span between the conclusion of their experience and the initiation of my investigation. Despite this separation and the usual period of missing time, both observers independently filled in their time lapses with a shared abduction experience during regressive hyp- nosis, with astonishing agreement in many major and minor details.\" Michael, then 16, and Janet, 19 (not their real names), were both on the staff of a private girls' camp (now defunct) on the southeastern shore of Lake Champlain, just north of Burlington, Vermont, when the incident oc- curred. Many of the counselors and campers were in Burlington for a state swim meet. Just after sunset, a glowing cigar-shaped object suddenly swooped down from the sky and emitted three smaller round objects over the lake. The latter cavorted about until two of them streaked off in opposite directions, the larger object having already departed. The third UFO now ap- proached Michael and Janet, who had been enjoying sunset at the end of a dock jutting into the lake. It ap- proached first to within 60 feet of the witnesses, then as close as ten feet away, revealing \"a classic disc with a transparent dome and revolving rim of spectral colors... According to Michael, two entities could be seen through the dome of the craft [who] communicated with him telepathically. Meanwhile Janet appeared to be frozen in a trancelike state.\" The disc then moved abruptly overhead and shone down a beam of light on the two. Michael remembered grabbing Janet and falling to the deck of the dock with her. He had the feeling of having passed out while under the light. He next remembered the sound of car doors and voices as the others returned from the swim meet. Two of the newly arrived campers ran out onto the dock, where they, too, watched as the UFO suddenly sped away. Both Michael and Janet immediately felt fatigued and fell asleep in their separate quarters. The next morning, neither could quite bring themselves to talk to the other about the incident. Camp closed a few weeks later, and both went their way. They did not see or contact each other until several years later, when Webb finally brought them both together for a brief reunion. Such are the basics of the case, and to reveal more in this review would be to give away the store, so to speak. Webb has invested an immense amount of time and en- ergy in the Buff Ledge investigation and deserves your support. And as they say in Hollywood, \"it's all up on the ENCOUNTER AT BUFF LEDGE A UFO CASE HISTORY screen,\" or, in this case, between the covers. In fact, the many illustrations and 306 pages don't begin to tell the half of it. Use only a slightly larger type size and the whole would probably run to 500 pages. This is clearly a case of getting your money's worth if ever there was one. If there is any quibble about Encounter at Buff Ledge (and the first law of reviewing says every book has at least one potential quibbling point), it is that all the maps, photographs and drawings are lumped together in the front of the book. Spreading same more judiciously throughout the main body of text would have made the whole more readable and even somewhat more sus- penseful. No doubt it would have increased production costs, too, proving once again that one can't always have everything. This very minor \"criticism\" aside.

A final note. Because of time and career considera- tions, editor David Gotlib has been compelled to put his most excellent Bulletin of Anomalous Experience on hiatus for the year 1995. Hopefully, we'll be able to in- form you of its impending resumption a year from now. T he May. 1994, issue of the Journal carried a cover article entitled \"Uncovering the Guardian Caper,\" also known as the Carp, Canada, case. The case is an ex- tensive one. ultimately involving everything from al- leged abductions, helicopter fly-overs and video of a landed UFO with accompanying alien, to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. It was featured prominently on several \"tabloid\" TV programs, including \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" \"Sightings\" and \"Encounters.\" The main American investigator was Robert Oechsler of Maryland. Several local members of MUFON Ontario and the Canadian UFO Research Network took excep- tion with the way Oechsler conducted his investigation and initiated a series of articles to correct what they saw as its shortcomings. Thinking the series would consist of two, or perhaps at most three, parts, I reprinted the initial report in the Journal. My intention was to reprint the rest of the series in a future issue, along with any response by Oechsler 1 (or, as it turned out, Bruce Maccabee). The project got quickly out of hand, and to those who have written wondering what happened, please let me explain. For starters, it soon became apparent that the series was going to run much, much longer than 1 had antici- pated. A fourth piece has just appeared in the latest MUFON Ontario Newsletter ( September, 1994), with at least one more installment promised. Reprinting every- thing written on both sides of the issue threatened to rum the Journal into the Carp Monthly. If the entire UFO phenomenon had suddenly decided to go on sabbatical, I might have been able to get everything in, but obvi- ously that wasn't going to happen, so what to do? In the meantime. Bob Oechsler announced his re- tirement from ufology, rendering some of the issues raised moot. My apologies, then, for originally biting off more than I could chew by promising to continue the se- ries in the Journal.

December 1994* Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, in Leo near Regulus, brightens nearly 2 times during the month, from magnitude 0.3 to -0.3. The red planet rises in the ENE about 10 PM on December 1 and about 8:30 on the 31st. It lies 2° N of Regulus on the night of the 7th-8th, the first of three conjunctions in a row for the pair. Saturn (magnitude 1.0). in Aquarius, is in the S at dusk. The world with rings sets in the W about 11 PM on the 1st and about 9PM on the 31st. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus rises about 3:30 AM in the E and ascends into the SE at dawn. The spectacular planet shines at maximum bril- liancy (-4.7) on December 9. A lunar crescent slips between Venus and Jupiter on the 29th. Mars stands high in the SSW at dawn. Jupiter (-1.7), advancing from Libra into Scorpius, rises in the ESE shortly after 5 AM in midmonth. While it remains rather low in the sky. the giant begins to move higher during December. Near it is the star Beta Scorpii. On the 23rd Jupiter pulls within a mere 1/4° of Beta. (The planet is more than 50 times brighter than the star.) Meteor Shower: The Geminid meteors achieve their maximum on the night of December 13-14, although unfortunately in the presence of a bright gibbous Moon. However, after the Moon sets shortly before 4 AM, there is a 1 3/4 hour window of total darkness. Try then to glimpse these bright, white meteors as they flash across the sky from Gemini the Twins at a rate of more than 50 per hour. Moon Phases: New moon—December 2 First quarter—December 9 Full moon—December 17  (^J) Last quarter—December 25 The Stars: During midevening hours the conspicuous stars of the winter circle rise above the E and SE horizon. If we move clockwise from the lowest star above the horizon, the stars are dazzling Sirius, Procyon, Pollux and Castor, Capella, Aldebaran, and Rigel. They encircle the mighty hunter Orion. Look for his hourglass outline and three belt stars at the center. Astride the celestial meridian high in the N can be found one of the most popular objects in the heavens, the Double Cluster of Perseus. First, look for two patches of light close to- gether between the \"W\" of Cassiopeia the Queen and the fish hook shape of Perseus the Champion. Then focus on the fuzzy spots with binoculars or a telescope. The patches resolve into hundreds of stars, many of them a few thousand times the diameter of our Sun.

Here too we will strive for the highest levels of quality in areas of interest that are considered to be most important to the community. Each proposal sent to MUFON will be considered. If it meets MUFON's general requirements we will ei- ther fund it ourselves or send it forward for review by the combined board. The combined board will evaluate each proposal on its merits as to the likelihood of ad- vancing scientific knowledge or increasing public un- derstanding of UFO-related phenomena. Projects meet- ing all criteria will be placed into a priority list at a level comparable to the board's evaluation of its im- portance toward advancing the group's goals. Scientific research projects shall receive highest pri- ority, followed by public education projects, followed by general special projects. However, this priority is not binding; a well-conceived public education proposal may be funded, while a poorly conceived research pro- posal would not. In general, we will not consider grant proposals that are intended to pay a salary, or projects that are of a pseudoscientific nature, or for grants that would do no more than support such things as newslet- ters, periodicals or general information flyers. Proposal forms may be secured by writing to any of the three above named organizations or to Thomas P. Deuley, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155-4099. JOURNAL SUBSCRIPTION AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT If you enjoy reading the MUFON UFO Journal, an an- nual subscription would be an ideal Christmas gift for a relative or close friend who shares an interest in the UFO enigma. Gift subscriptions can start on the month of your choice. A cut-out subscription form has been in- cluded on page 11 of the October issue of the Journal for your convenience. If you do not want to damage your magazine, a xerox copy of this portion of the page is appropriate. A gift subscription to the world's leading UFO magazine will not only be appreciated, but will be a means of cultivating UFO public education of a sci- entific nature versus the tabloid journalism existing in the supermarkets. This is an opportunity to start filling your Christmas gift list now. Upon receipt of a sub- scription order, an appropriate card will be mailed to the recipient acknowledging your thoughtful gift. WESTERN REGION DIRECTOR VACANCY Robert J. Gribble (Seattle, WA), Western Regional Director, submitted his resignation effective July 25. 1994. His four-year term would have normally expired in December 1994. MUFON is now actively seeking candidates for this prestigious position on the Board of Directors to fill the vacancy. The Western Region is composed of the following mountain states: Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, and all of the states west of these including Alaska and Hawaii. We are so- liciting individuals who have had previous MUFON leadership positions such as State Director, Assistant State Director, and State Section Director as examples. If you are interested in accepting greater leadership re- sponsibilities, please write to Walt Andrus expressing your desire to fill this role and your qualifications. As of this date, only two candidates have volunteered their ser- vices. This will be the last invitation for candidates to submit their names prior to the election by their col- leagues in the Western Region. Until such time as a new Western Regional Director is elected, all State Directors in the western region of states should send their completed UFO sighting reports directly to the Deputy Director Investigations, T. David Spencer, 6700 Woodcrest, Austin, TX 78759. DIRECTOR OF LEGAL AFFAIRS VACANCY The recent resignation of Kenneth A. Wong, J.D. as Director of Legal Affairs has created an opportunity for one of MUFON's 34 Consultants in Law to volunteer to fill this vacancy on the MUFON Board of Directors. The position is basically to head up and coordinate our diversified nation-wide legal staff and provide legal ad- vice to the MUFON Board of Directors upon request. To date, we have received only one applicant. Considering the vast number of talented attorneys who are MUFON members, we had anticipated receiving several candi- dates. This will be the last invitation for volunteers to be considered for this prestigious responsibility. Please give this opportunity your serious consideration. We invite interested attorneys to contact Robert H. Bletchman, J.D., 360 E. Center Street, Manchester, CT 06040-4440; telephone (203) 643-2433 or Walter Andrus in Seguin, TX at (210) 379-9216. THE ROSWELL DECLARATION OMNI magazine published an explanation and a copy of \"The Roswell Declaration\" in their October 1994 issue and requested that the declaration be signed, torn out, and returned to OMNI magazine by November 30, 1994. The MUFON UFO Journal initiated this proposal in the April 1994 issue with an article by Kent Jeffrey tided \"Taking the Offensive on Roswell.\" To date, 3,000 signed declarations have been returned to MUFON in Seguin, Texas, including those forwarded from the Fund for UFO Research. In addition, nearly 300 declarations have been received from foreign countries. In order to give people who have not returned a signed declaration previously to MUFON, OMNI or any other UFO organization, an opportunity to do so has again been provided in the October issue of the Journal. Either detach the declaration from your copy or make a xerox copy, complete the pertinent information, and mail it to MUFON. It is designed whereby copies can be made for distribution to your friends and colleagues for their signatures also.

Texas State Director, Ellen R. Stuart, is proud to announce the selection of Antoinette M. \"Toni\" Butz, R.N. (Piano), to become her Assistant Stale Director for northern Texas. Gary Levine, Ph.D., New York State Director, has appointed Dana M. Schmidt, J.D. (Rochester), to also serve as Assistant State Director for western and upper New York state.

FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S TRAINING GUIDE To supplement the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. T. David Spencer with the cooperation of the Austin MUFON group has published a new UFO Field Investigator's Training Guide. It is described as an in- troduction to methodologies, techniques, and scientific disciplines for performing UFO investigations in support of the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. Mr. Spencer com- posed this training guide when he was teaching the an- nual Austin MUFON Field Investigator's class as their chief investigator. He has been MUFON's Database Administrator for two years, entering the completed UFO sighting reports in the computer after they were processed by the late Jerold \"Ron\" Johnson, Deputy Director - Investigations. David was recently elected to the MUFON Executive Committee and Board of Directors, replacing Ron Johnson. This training guide is not to be confused with the forthcoming fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual which is due to be released late in 1994, but used as a training guide for the instructors teaching field investigator's training classes. The train- ing guide is an 8 1/2\" x 11\", 304 page book assembled in a three-ring binder. It may be purchased from MUFON in Seguin, Texas for $30 plus $3.50 for shipping and handling. This book is highly recommended for both in- structors and students. INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL OUT OF PRINT The third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is out-of-print. It has been removed from the MUFON Publications List. Work is progressing very well on publishing an expanded version to'be identified as the fourth edition in the near future. Please do not de- lay conducting Field Investigator training classes due to the absence of the fourth edition. Some sections or chapters of the present manual are only being updated, whereas new sections on abduction investigations, ani- mal mutilations, crop circles, and polygraph will be added. Explicit instructions on completing Form 1 and Form 2 will also be new. The expanded section on in- terviewing witnesses by Dan Wright will be another asset to the new manual. The availability date and price will be announced in the Journal. Please do not back order the new manual since it will be doubled in size, and the price has not been determined from the printer. We are very excited about the fourth edition, since it will be a state-of-the-art publication. We are targeting late 1994 for its publishing date. RESEARCH PROPOSALS The Mutual UFO Network has joined with the Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research in a coalition that will solicit for research proposals and subjects and in turn pass judgment on them and then will fund worthy projects with monetary grants. The interest of all three groups is to move the business of UFOs more toward science. In that regard, we are most inter- ested in projects that would be classified as Scientific, using the general protocols of the scientific method. Our second interest would be in projects that would serve to educate the UFO community and the general Continued on Page 23 PAGE 24 NUMBER 319 NOVEMBER 1994"}]
