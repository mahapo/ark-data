P phenomena which when have soupht.,it, explanation from many capable zstronomers ar;i scien; isr)s, has left them either silent, or frankly skeptical and mcredulc~s- As I hzve said, astronomically spe~king 1910 was a red 1-etJter yen;- because as you will remember, two great conet,s blazed fcrth iri.:C vlcw only a few weeks apart, one a mzgnificent spectacle appeared sudsenly and unexpected just over the western horizon in January, By thc first of April the second celestial wanderer appeared, for it was then that mysterious cosmic missile known as Haleyt s comet came hur tli~g int.r, view in the night time skies of the northern hemisphere, an objec; of interesting, if weird beauty as night after night its uncanny brill- iance increased with its ever lessening distance from the Sun; k dis- tance which was daily growing smzller zt the appalling rate of ms-e than a million miles due to the comet's headlong plunge toward the Sun for its reguler seventy-five year perihelion visit, Now, as astronomers well know, Haleyts is a very orderly and rcgu- lar visitor to our Solar system and has been known as such for hundreds of years; but as you no doubt recall during this interesting 1910 visit, some enterprising newspeper chap came out with the story to the effect that at thzt particular time the peculiar position of the comt was such as to render the danger of collicjion.with the earth a likely :,:cz- sibility, Of course, this story gzlnsd wide circulation in the news- papers and magazines of the time and found only too many people w5ose credulity mzde them ready believe~s in this fanciful talc; 2s a r@.-ll';- inspired in many a very pronounced uneasi~ess which with scrre 2.t le,.si amounted to absolute terror.

This was particukrly true in many of the rural cornmunitlc-s of southern Illinois, and dire predictihns of tne approaching end of the wcrl-d were freely made, NOW as I have said: while the observers had ronclusively proven by their calculations thzt we were in no danger whctever of e direct hit froin the comet, still they did discover a very peruli;r~ circum- stance and one moreover which lent some semblance of reall~y to ~1:e fantastic stories of the newspaper men. It was the fact disclosed by their researches that on May loth, the comet would pass dirt:. tly bccwecn the Sun and Earth and as the tail of the conet zlways polnt; cirectly away from the Sun,there was a very strong proba5illt.y t;hat the Farth. might pass through a section of it.

I was, of course, most intently observing the heavens all during the earlier hours of the evening for signs of any unv.sllz1 happen- ' ings, particularly was I curious to see whether or not there would be any uncommon number of meteors; but nothing at all out of the orciinary was visible, not even the comet itsclf, since i$ was now in conj~nctlon with the Sun and hence below the horizon, so toward eleven orc,ocl; I decided to retire for a few hours sleep znd have another look in .;he early hours which precede the dawn. I seemed to fall aslcep as soon as I touched the bed and seeminglv hzrdly a second later was awake again, reaching for my watch and striking a light. I was smazed to note that it was 2:30 a.m, Being mindful to see what, if anything, had developed during my three 2nd one half hours asleep, I dressed and walked out for a few obskrvations. Seldom, if ever, have I seen a night more perfect for the purpose, The air was unusuallv clear and the myriads of stars and constellatFons shown with the dazzling beauty and distinctness of microspic arc lighss against the jet-black color of the sky, while, overhead the faiilter an2 more remote beauty of the milky wav spanned the celesti~l vault like some far off river of silvery, luminous sand.

Flashing into vkew with the instantaneous quickness of a bolt of lightning, a dazzling red meteor appeared or ratner-what on the spur of the ino~ent I presumed to be a meteor, but what erracik.. law or whim was governing the motion of this strange meteor if such it was? Where byt a second before not a thing out of the 0rd.j-ary h2d been visible in the sky, there was now appwring to ny z>?.sf~unci.ed and incredulous vision a fiery red globe larger and brighter ~hnn ?Tzcus,, slowly 2nd leisurely drifting zcross the sky foliowing a sTlg,:t17 sig zag and irregular path3 toward the northeast, and with a s2em.1 ap?xr- ently not much greater than our -present dey air y!l~nr-s would at~aii~.

The resemblznce tc: ?:arc (although, of course, many times ?:-..;-:~hter) was very striking and t!~c?? was not the faintest hint of tne fi c~y trail of sparks which are the usual accompaniment of meteors and sh~oting stars, This slcw drlf't!.ng motion of the strange object was puzzling enough for as all observsrs -. know, the motion of a common aeteor is exceedingly swift and USU:::!-Y over almost ,hefore' one has time to get a good' look at it, b1~t eT~-el7 stranger things .were to imr~lediately happen, I had, by this th?, fol?o~ ed the object's movements with eager watchfulness for a perixi whieh I judge must have been two minutes,From a point about one third wdq~ down to the southwestern horizon almost directly overhead to a point well down toward the northeast horizon, when suddenly with a jerky, convulsive shud&ing movement, its mo$ion stopped altogether 2nd I was gazing withlastonishment at a motionless, sinister red orb suspended - against the background of scintillating stars-and deep blac? sky, if I had b een surprised before, I w2s truly amazed now fo- surely no ordinary meteor hzd ever behaved in this manner before.

This time, however, its journey wzs extremely short lived, not more than ten seconds did it follow its slightly zigzag path when with the suddenness of a lighting flash, it was gone. Not a t7acc not a sign of its prcsence remained, where but a second before it h~d shown in all its ruddy end sinister brlllianre, there was now only the twinkling stars, and the deepening drarkness which heralds the dawn. So strange, so fantastic, so utterly preposter2,us did the whole thing seem to me thet as I returned to bed to lie pondering and think- ing, I could not possibly convince myself that it had no2 been an hallucination. In fact, I finally decided to consider it as such 2nd to say nothing of the mztter to anyone, Imagine my surprise then, when on the following day, I-chanced to meet an acquaintance from the neighboring village of Laclede who informed me that he, together with several other yoang peclp1 e of thc village, h2d held an all night 7'comet p;rtyTf and he vol-l.?t.,:*ily re- lated to me the very thing which I had scen, 2nd knoi:.'ng P~,: 2ilte-Aes: in astronomy, ~sked for an ex-plqns-Lion which I was ~!li~:ll~ :q gi-re, As 1 h?l~~ s:,al pd r?h91,7e, t.hi~ LTn8-7Jr \"IKCP s+?-vrk me at :-hn b,ly:~ as > ( COQ ti ;.lll~4 ni? ncr t page )"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"An Enigma of the He2vens (continued) being a most extr2ordin~r-y astrononical puzzle, and such it has re- mainsd through all these nineteen yezrs.

Strange as it nay seem, there can be no question thzt the fzcts in the case occurred exactly as related, let your interpretation be what it may. Whatevcr the ob- ject may have been, it must have been intirely outside our oreEn of alr. This is definitely shown by the fact that it did not partcke of the Ezrthl s rotational movement, b~it after stopping appeared tr-> rise in the sky exactly like the regul.zr hesvenly bodies and with about the sane speed. Had it been mersly a luminous ball of gss suspended in the air, as some authorities have suggested, there would have been no appzrent motion of rising as was the case when it became stationary, because all objects within the Earth's atmosy,hcre rxr:r, of necessity share with the ataospher~ the Earth's eastward movement of rotation, To have been outside our aerial envelope it would h~ve hzd to have been at 2 distance of at lcast two hundred miles from the Earth's sur- face and how much farther it may have been, we cannot say, At th~t distance to h2ve Bppezred larger and bri~hter-than Venus, it would have been necessary that it have a diameter of many hundred ~3rd~ ~nd also at thpt distance to have given the effect of even slow motion th~t was appzrent, it would hzve been imperative that it 1;2 traveling at the terrific speed of thousands of miles per hour, Now'just wh~t the answc,r to this perplexing array of facts may Se, I cannot say. You may say that it was merely some unusuel phenonma ' connected with the comet and this theory I can no3 entirely disprove, but there are factors which make it appear extremely doubtful. First: the object was moving d'irectly toward the cornet or neerly so while its motion was more nesrly at right angles to the cometary orbit. Second: how account for the fact of its slow motion if you say it was some sort of cometary satellite, for even though its speed was terrific, it was very ruch slower than thet of the comet at thzt time, As I watched its erratic movements that long ,gone night, there was borne strikingly upon my mind a curious impression of intelligent control. Ana a suggestion of deliberate observation on the part of the strange red mystery wss startlingly impressive as it paused and I hung motionless that long hour in the midnight sky. Could It have been possible then that it really was some monstrous inter-plaetary or even inter-steller vehicle, possessing a power of making itself luminous or non-luminous at will? Could it have been that it was .something propelled and guided across spzce by intelligent beings? And is it possible that thus traveling , it by chance or design, passed near our planet and paused momentarily to gaze upon it perhags even debatimg the advisability of attempting to reach its surfzce for a brief visit? I confess that it sounds wildly impossible 2nd .yet. . ? Anyone watching it that night could easily hcve been persuzded that after a long period of indecision, the mysterious orb suddenly decided upon a course of action and again started to move, only to .?anish in a few seconds.

As the witnesses stopped their ato to observe the object, and throufhout most of the duration of the sight- ing, sever21 other automobiles passed, but nofie stopped or appe~red to notice the object which, again first ap>e~rcd to be no more than a. con- ventional aircraft.

At 12:30 a.m. April 27, 1964, Gallegos saw an unidentified flying ob ject--a flying saucer, The Air Force last month concluded that UFOs do not exist and dis- continued its investigation of them. The people of La Madera, which means RThe Timbe~\"in Spa~ish, hzve generally forgotten about the UFOs also, but there are still some who can vividly describe wh2t Gallegos s2w that nipht. Looking north toward the scrub-lined shores of the trickling Valle- citos River, Gallegos saw what he later described as an \"egg-shaped object, longer than a telephone pole and ebout 100 feet in circumfer- ence.\" The object, accord in^ to the stprtled G~llegos, h?d no visible windows or doors.

Former U. S.

Naranjo szid most of the townspeople view the incident as 2 joke, Naranjo rnd then deouty sheriff Pete J~ramillo both s~ld they felt thk excitement 2nd fear arising from the Socorro incident added fuel to the incident at La Madera. Stpte Police Chief Martin Vigil, however, said he could not go along with Naranjo's theory, but hc could offer no explanztion. Vigil, commander of the st~te police district which included La Madera, said he sent officers Albert Vega 2nd David Kingsbury to in- vestigate. \"They reported the ground wss still smouldering when they arrived the next day and whatever burned thcr e hed to have been pretty hot,\" said Vigil, referring to the l~rge circular piece of burned ground. The area, however, was part of a community dump which included many highly inflamable items. Whatever it wzs, the memory has faded through the year:j 2nd the area residents, or most of them, ere not concerned, We even talked to Gal-legos 2nd he just laugheci cff the whole thing, said Naran jo."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Several UFO Ma~zzines Are Drop~ing Out During the past yea- 2 number of UFO ~ublications hzve ceased wblicetion, or have announccd their intention of doing s: on a given date.
