By Bob Pratt and Cynthia Luce One night in January 1996, an American phased-ar- ray radar station detected several unknown targets enter- ing the atmosphere at high speed over Alaska. They were heading toward the U.S. Southwest. Data was instantly relayed to the NORAD command center in Colorado, where computers determined that the targets were not air- craft, spacecraft, space debris, ICBMs, or asteroids. Their altitude was constantly monitored as they came down through the atmosphere, and their track was fol- lowed southward. NORAD's computers began predict- ing a trajectory based on speed and altitude data. The ob- jects slowed to 4,000 mph, and as they leveled off at 55,000 feet, NORAD alerted intercept bases in Phoenix. But the objects changed direction slightly, zipped on past Arizona and started a slower descent over Mexico. The computers soon predicted an impact point far to the south in central Brazil. As the objects continued descending, the computers continuously measured the trajectory data and refined the impact point to a smaller and smaller circle. By then the Space Command had locked a spy satellite in on the ob- jects and predicted the impact zone would be within 100 miles of the city of Varginha in the state of Minas Gerais. Brazilian authorities were quickly notified, and they im- mediately alerted Army units near Varginha. * * * Some of the above is speculation based on the fact that a Brazilian Air Force officer told a UFO investigator that on Jan. 13. NORAD notified Brazilian authorities it had tracked a number of UFOs over the western hemi- sphere that night, and one or more had come down near Varginha ( Var-ZJEEN-yuh}. It was the beginning of one of the most intriguing events in UFO history-the \"Varginha ET Case.\" Civilian investigators now believe that over the next several weeks at least two and perhaps as many as six alien creatures were captured or killed and turned over to American au- thorities, and that a UFO may have crashed. Described as humanoid Eyewitnesses described the creatures as humanoid, three to four feet tall, with dark brown, hairless skin that was very oily, a big triangular head with three short \"horns\" on top, and huge red, vertically oval eyes. They About the authors Both Bob Pratt and Cynthia Luce have been investi- gating for more than 20 years. Cynthia, who holds a master's degree in anthropol- ogy/experimental psychology, is an American who has lived in the mountain village of Sao Jose do Vale do Rio Preto, two hours northwest of Rio de Janeiro, for nearly 25 years. Most of that time she has been a member and section direc- tor of MUFON, contributing to the Journal as well as other publications that deal with anomalous phenomena. While working in archaeology in various remote regions of Bra- zil, she has collected much varied data and hopes to corre- late it with researchers in other areas. Bob Pratt, a journalist for 46 years, has interviewed about 1,800 people in ten countries in North and South America and the Far East who have had UFO experiences. For six years he covered UFO stories for the National Enquirer, going to Brazil four times. Since 1981, however, he has investigated on his own, going to Brazil eight more times and Puerto Rico twice. He is a former editor of the MUFON UFO Journal and is the author of UFO Danger Zone: Terror and Death in Brazil-What Next? (1996, Horus House Press, P.O. Box 55185, Madison, WI 53705-8985), and co-author with Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Philip J. Imbrogno of Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings (Ballantine Books, 1987) and the new updated and expanded version, Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings (Llewellyn Publications, 1998). Pratt and Luce have worked together in Brazil on six different occasions. Interestingly, the first time, in 1979, was in Varginha working with one of the investigators in the current article, Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues, then a law student, on a case of his involving a hunter who had seen four UFOs in daytime and was briefly abducted. had long thin arms and short thin legs, no obvious noses or ears and only slits for mouths. They weren't wearing clothing, and no sex organs were visible. Particularly strik- ing is that they had unusually large veins growing out of their necks and running down their shoulders, arms, chest and back, making them look like weight lifters. The \"Varginha case\" is a complicated one involving a series of incidents that began that Saturday, Jan. 13, but did not come to public attention until more than a week later after three young women spotted one of the crea- tures in a vacant lot. That encounter, around 3 o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, Jan. 20, occurred in the Jardim Andere district of Varginha as the three were walking home after helping a woman get ready to move to an- other home. \"We decided to take a shortcut through a vacant lot,\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 August 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Looking down across pasture toward Santana neighborhood.

Railroad tracks run through the narrow passage this side of power lines. said Liliane da Silva, then 16, who was with her sister Valquiria, 14, and a friend, Katia Xavier, 22. Katia is a maid for the woman who was moving, and the sisters, still in school, were helping her pack household goods. They had finished work and were walking to their homes in the Santana neighborhood just north of Jardim Andere. The sloping lot was filled with tall grass and weeds and had a path running through it. On one side was an empty cinder block building. When the three had walked about 50 feet into the lot, something caught Liliane's atten- tion. \"Look at that!\" she cried. About 20 feet away to their left was a strange creature squatting next to the building with its left side to them. Its left arm was between its legs and the right was next to the building. Its feet were hid- den in the grass, and the girls never saw the hands or feet. \"It had oily brown skin with big eyes and three 'horns' on its head.\" We thought it was the devil. The huge veins reminded her sister Valquiria of \"a big, soft bull's heart... We thought it was the Devil.\" To Katia, who is married and has three children, it was \"not a human or an animal-nothing like a monkey or anteater. We got a good look at the creature.\" It was repulsive looking, but the huge red eyes and the \"horns\" were what disturbed them most. They stared for a stunned few seconds, then screamed and recoiled in fright. The creature turned its head and looked at them, seemed almost frightened, and crouched a bit lower, per- haps trying to hide from them. The women fled back to- the street behind them, turned right, and ran away as fast as they could, not stopping until they reached the Da Silva home more than 20 blocks away. About twenty minutes later, after the three had calmed down, Katia and the girls' mother, Luiza, asked a neigh- bor to drive them back to the vacant lot. By then the crea- ture was gone, said Katia, \"but we could see the grass mashed down and we could smell sulfur or ammonia.\" News of the incident spread quickly throughout the neighborhood, and about 10:30 a.m. the next day reached the ears of Varginha's leading UFO investigator, Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues, then 42, who lives less than a mile from where this happened. He got a call from a shop owner who had heard that \"some girls had seen a weird animal, like a little monster.\" The report was interesting, but it meant nothing to Ubirajara (Oo-BEE-ruh-ZJAR-uh), a lawyer and univer- sity professor who has been investigating UFOs in the Varginha area since the 1970s. By evening, though, he had heard more rumors and then began trying to find out what had happened. A friend named Sergio, who works at a TV station, helped him, and it took them several days to identify and locate Katia and the sisters-days in which rumors, confusing and seemingly contradictory, were fly- ing all over the city. \"Some people were saying a creature had been cap- tured by Military Police and taken to Regional Hospital, that it had a big belly, seemed to be pregnant, and made a noise like it was crying,\" Ubirajara said. \"We talked to a boy who said he saw the capture, but his words didn't make any sense. He was too childish and very confused.\" Woman runs away i They tracked down a woman who also supposedly had witnessed the capture, \"but she ran away the mo- ment we approached her. Her husband tried to convince her to talk to us, but she refused.\" When Ubirajara finally talked to the three women, all three cried as they told their story. In the following days he questioned them sev-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1998 PageS eral more times, and each time they related the same de- tails without variation, becoming quite emotional and bursting into tears the first several times. He became con- vinced they were telling the truth. The rumors continued. A nurse reluctantly told Ubirajara that a section of Regional Hospital had been blocked off for some hours the night of January 20, with access being denied to patients, visitors and even em- ployees. Soldiers and Army vehicles had been parked outside, and unidentified physicians from other cities had come to the hospital. Deny everything On Monday the 22nd, all hospital employees were called together and told that everything that had happened that weekend was to be ignored because \"it was just a training exercise for doctors and military personnel.\" Then they were told that if anyone (\"espe- cially that lawyer Ubirajara\") should inquire about it, they were to deny ev- erything. The creature was reportedly trans- ferred to Humanitas Hospital, which is much smaller and is in a more se- cluded location, and more troops were seen there. One report said the crea- ture, apparently dead, was seen lying \"°\" in an open box propped up by two sawhorses in the hospital's walled-in parking lot. Fifteen military men, doc- tors, and others stood watching as one of the doctors used tweezers to pull a long, thin black tongue out of its mouth. Rumors abounded, even in school yards. One young- ster was heard saying: \"My daddy told me about the ET and said everything is true, and he has seen a film, but this is very dangerous and you cannot tell anyone.\" Ubirajara checked around and learned that a relative of the child's father worked at a nearby Army base and was under house arrest at the base. Ubirajara went to Military Police headquarters and talked to the commander, a lieutenant colonel. When Ubirajara explained why he was there, the colonel said he knew nothing about any creature, but offered to check it out. Ubirajara phoned repeatedly over the next few days, but was never able to reach the man. That was when Ubirajara began to believe something unusual really had taken place and that officials were hid- ing something. He was certain of it a day or so later when a friend talked with a policewoman who had been on duty on Saturday, Jan. 20. She said the police received a num- ber of phone calls that morning through the emergency number from people \"saying they saw a little monster. From left, A. J. Gevaerd, editor of UFO Maga- zine and MUFON director for Brazil, Cynthia Luce, and Ubirajara Rodrigues in front of the garage of Ubirajara's Center for the Investigation of UFO's. But we thought they were kidding and didn't pay any attention to them.\" For nearly a month the investigation proceeded in the belief that only one incident had occurred-that the three women had seen a creature which was later cap- tured-and that for unknown reasons the authorities were trying to hush it up. What was difficult to understand was that some of the rumors said the creature had been cap- tured in the morning on Jan. 20 before the girls saw it in the afternoon. The investigation entered a new phase in mid-Febru- ary when Vitorio Pacaccini joined the investigation. Pacaccini (Pahk-uh-CHEEN-ee), who lives 190 miles away in the state capital, Belo Horizonte, did not know Ubirajara at the time and learned about the Varginha case only on Sunday, Feb. 11, when he read a newspaper story about the three women and the creature. Pacaccini chosen to investigate Pacaccini, then 32, had been a member of CICOANI (Civilian Center for the Investigation of Unidentified Fly- ing Objects) in Belo Horizonte for 18 years. At a special meeting two nights later, the members discussed the Varginha report, decided to investigate and chose Pacaccini to go to Varginha. This was a practical choice for several reasons. First, his job as an import-export con- sultant had no set hours and allowed him considerable free time. Secondly, he had grown up in Tres Coracoes (TRACE Core-uh-SOY-shhh), a city just 15 miles east of Varginha. And he had already made plans to go to Tres Coragoes, where his widowed mother still lives, for the annual Carnaval festivities at the end of the week. Tres Coracoes plays a significant role in the case be- cause ES A (Escola de Sargentos das Armas, or school for sergeants), the area's largest Army base, is located there,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 August 1998 MUFON UFO Journal and personnel from the base are believed to have taken a major part in the hunt for and capture of the creatures. Man willing to talk The day after the C1COANI meeting, Feb. 14, Pacaccini drove to Tres Cora9oes, phoned Ubirajara to introduce himself, and set up a meeting for the following day. In an extraordinary coincidence, shortly after arriv- ing at his mother's home Pacaccini got a phone call from a friend saying a man who knew about the capture of the creature would be willing to talk to him. The three met late that night in a secluded area, where the man described in detail how four firemen had captured the creature on die morning of Jan. 20. The informant's story helped clear up the confusion about the rumors, because it led to the realization that there had been two creatures, the one captured in the morning and taken to ESA and the one seen by the three women, which may have been caught and taken to the hospital. Eventually, Ubirajara and Pacaccini came to believe the authorities had captured or killed at least four others. Originally Pacaccini had intended to conduct his own investigation, but after meeting with Ubirajara and ex- changing information with him, the two agreed to work together. Over the next six months or so Pacaccini was able to make frequent trips to Varginha from Belo Horizonte. This took much of the burden off Ubirajara, who has a busy law practice representing businesses in worker-compensation cases, and who teaches two nights a week at a university where he is a law professor and a lecturer in philosophy. The two weren't working blind. The case soon at- tracted the attention of newspapers and radio and TV sta- tions, and began to get considerable publicity, both lo- cally and nationally. Ubirajara received hundreds of phone calls, many from people who knew something about what had happened, or knew someone who knew someone who... Every rumor checked They checked out every rumor and report, and tracked down every witness or potential witness. They heard about a farm couple who saw a UFO very early on the morning of Jan. 20 (true); a woman who saw a creature at the city's zoo (true); a portable radar station mat was trucked in from southern Brazil (unconfirmed); a motorist who saw a creature weeks later (true); a military man who told a friend he had helped capture \"an ET\" (unconfirmed); an- other military person whose uniform got so \"oily\" in cap- turing a creature that his wife burned his clothing (uncon- firmed); the mysterious death of a soldier who had cap- tured one creature (true); and the puzzling deaths of five animals at the zoo (true). Ubirajara and Pacaccini even- tually were able to talk to 25 firsthand witnesses-civil- ians, Military Policemen, Army personnel, doctors, and others. They also learned the identities of nearly every military person involved with the creatures in any way. At the same time, investigators in other cities were also helping, mainly checking rumors that on Jan. 23 sev- eral creatures had been convoyed to the renowned Uni- versity of Campinas in Campinas, a city just northwest of Sao Paulo, where an autopsy had been performed on one creature. Our report is based mainly on visits we made to Varginha in March 1996, just two months after most of these events took place, and again hi August 1997. We spent four days there the first time, talking with Ubirajara and Pacaccini, before very much was known, and six days the second visit. By then a great deal more had been discovered, but we never had enough tune to cover ev- erything we wanted to know about. Only Ubirajara was available during our second visit, Pacaccini being elsewhere in the state, and Ubirajara's tune was limited because of his law practice, his teach- ing, and the fact that he was chairing a UFO conference in a nearby city the last four days of our visit. Still, he talked with us whenever he had a few minutes free in both cities, and several times took us to locations in Varginha where things had occurred. Proof of alien? \"As an attorney,\" Ubirajara said in the beginning, \"if I was in a court of law and had to prove that the firemen had captured an alien from another planet-widi proof coming from an accredited place like the University of Campinas which would issue an official notice that said, 'One dead alien blah, blah, blah, of this blood type or other'-we have not been able to get that. We believe such reports exist and that this actually happened. I can prove- with testimony and witnesses, and we have the witnesses- that these things occurred, but we don't have any official reports. A creature was captured, but where it came from we can't prove without analysis.\" It must be said that there is far more to learn about the Varginha case than we have learned already. Only a book could give all the details (and Pacaccini has written \\wo-lncidente em Varginha in Portuguese, published in October 1996, and The Smoking Gun, in English, to be released in the U.S. later this year). However, some of the things we learned are in- cluded in the second part of this article, which will run next month."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1998 Page? Beverly Trout An Alien'Big Push'? By Beverly Trout Several case investigations in Iowa during the past three years have led me to believe that the aliens are deliberately, and with carefully orchestrated sighting scenarios, bringing pressure to bear on witnesses. The following is only one ex- ample, but it's a prime ex- ample of what I think of as the alien \"BIG PUSH\" as they drive witnesses over the edge so that they will report what's going on. For more than 20 years a high-profile family in a rural Sioux City, IA, area had been experiencing phe- nomena in and around the area of their family home: \"frogmen\" in the house; shadowy figures; bizarre pregnancy dreams; strange lights (with no known source); partial electrical malfunctions not tied to nor- mal causes; street lights which temporarily malfunc- tioned when certain members of the family would drive past; a huge \"bird\" which covered the windshield of their slow-moving car one night, with the \"bird\" sim- ply disappearing, instead of lifting off and flying away- and more. All of which, to a UFO researcher, would raise strong suspicions that the family was a part of alien-human interaction. This family, however, was not looking into the UFO enigma. They were busy, involved, absorbed in the details of everyday life, and frequently on the road trav- eling between homes and businesses. And although family members sometimes reported these strange hap- penings to one another, there was a tendency to shrug aside what they could not understand or explain. Impossible to ignore Then came the night of Aug. 7, 1997, when three family members were bombarded with the UFO pres- ence in no uncertain terms-and they could ignore the phenomena no longer. Family members involved were 22-year-old Frank, 11 -year-old Justin, and 50-year-old Brenda (mother of Frank and grandmother of Justin). Frank arrived at Justin's home about 9:30 p.m. to bring the 11-year-old back to \"Grandma's house\" to stay overnight. On the way home, the boys slowly (about 20 miles per hour) drove through a heavily wooded area with deep ravines and winding roads. No more than 400 feet away and 200 feet in altitude, they saw the lights of a 60-foot triangle, which proceeded to pace the car for about two miles. At the end of the two-mile stretch, the triangle crossed the road and de- parted in the opposite direction. Both boys had, by this time, begun to cry, but didn't know why. And they were still crying when they arrived home. On the way home and only a short distance from the residence, a strange animal emerged from the side of the road and \"bumped\" very hard into the passen- ger door of the car, and looked in the window as it did so. This was like no animal they had ever seen in the area. Their best description was that it resembled a hyena. It was light tan with dark stripes and spots, and had very long legs, a hump back of its neck, huge teeth, a short pointed nose, tiny ears, and looked muscled and powerful-and when it looked in the car window, its eyes glowed like red lights. Missing time Frank and Justin headed on home and shouted for Grandmother Brenda as they arrived. It was now 10:30 p.m., and in the excitement the boys had not yet real- ized that what should have been a 15-minute drive had taken a full hour-so at this point, they have \"missing time\" of about 45 minutes. Grandmother Brenda stepped out on the second floor deck of her bedroom in her pajamas, and in the midst of their babbling about UFOs, she argued that there is no such thing as UFOs. Famous last words! The 11-year-old pointed southwest of the house, and there, about 3/4 mile away and at about 500 feet alti- tude, was a second triangle-this one perhaps 300 feet in size. This object, barely moving, was in the area for 15 minutes. Then something else claimed their attention. To the west of the house, perhaps a mile away and with an apparent size of a little less than a full moon, was an amber-colored globe of light from which other globes of light emerged and darted around, then again merged with the original and faded out-this process occurring at least twice as the family watched. (The moon was visible in that general area that night, and the family saw it, but they insist that this was some- thing different.) Finally, after about 15 minutes, both objects dis- appeared at the same time. It was now 10:45 p.m., and all three witnesses drove back over the route taken by the boys, hoping to find the objects again, but to no avail. Quite an onslaught. I would label this as an ALIEN PRESENCE OVERKILL. And there's more to the story. Heads with no faces That night, 11 -year-old Justin had a nightmare and woke up crying. There were lots of hands touching him, he was seeing heads with no faces, he couldn't move, and he was being carried and laid on a \"couch.\" This"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS August 1998 MUFON UFO Journal is a child who had previously reported many other in- cidents (of an apparent alien nature) to his parents, but they had not been willing to listen. (More on this as- pect of the story later.) Alien orchestration? As a field investigator, 1 see this whole episode heavily earmarked with alien orchestration and per- suasion, designed to get this family to report these hap- penings. And they did. First to the FAA, then as rec- ommended by the FAA, to the UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, with Seattle then referring the family to me. Why would the aliens slam all this at the family? Two triangles, one of which paced the slow-moving car for two miles, with the second triangle a huge, si- lent, not-to-be-ignored presence in the area-for a full 15 minutes! And what about the strange animal, and the spectacular light display? All of this presented at a conscious level, and to multiple family witnesses; and then added to the mix of visual UFO evidence, there finally came the realization that the two boys had \"miss- ing time.\" Why the blatant display of UFO orchestration? Is it possible that the UFO occupants want the family to face-AT A CONSCIOUS LEVEL-what's been hap- pening in their lives? Are they forcing the issue by put- ting on such a display that it cannot be ignored, per- haps for some reason wanting to dispense with the old, vague, somewhat hidden interaction which seems to have been taking place for many years? Consider this. Many more visual sightings and low- level UFO vehicle approaches have occurred to this family since Aug. 7, 1997-sometimes with family friends also present at the scene. I frequently receive phone calls from family members relating current hap- penings. As they perceive and try to assess this con- tinuing string of UFO-related events, there is a thera- peutic aspect in their knowing there is someone who will listen (without revealing their identity) to what is taking place on a progressive, fast-track basis. (Paren- thetically, I need to say that the presence of Dr. Lawrence Lacey, State Section Director in the Sioux City area, has been invaluable to this on-going inves- tigation, and I have recently drawn Daryl Stangl, As- sistant State Director, into contact with this family. Frankly speaking, they need us.) Now on to recent events involving this family. Two balls of light Two balls of light (about tennis ball size) swooped low over their heads one evening as several family members and friends stood on their drive. Twice an object about the size of a helicopter, which emitted a low humming, rather muffled sound, came very close to the residence. On the first occasion, it came within an estimated city block of the house at about 100 feet altitude. At a later date, what they believe to be the same craft approached and actually moved the trees which line the family driveway. Other family members are also heavily involved in the UFO phenomenon. Brenda's 27-year-old daugh- ter, whom I will call Joan, and her girlfriend had a tree- top level sighting near a wooded area in the Fall of 1997-and there are many other incidents reported by Joan since her childhood; i.e. she reports \"frogmen,\" and readily sketches the reptilian type of alien. On Dec. 30, 1997, at about 9:30 p.m., 22-year-old Frank was home alone, the rest of the family having traveled to another state on vacation. He arrived home from dining out, and as he got out of his car he saw what appeared to be a reddish-orange object in the shape of a ruler or 2 x 4 lying horizontal just over the brow of a low hill east of the house at low altitude (he estimates it at 1,000 feet). Physical effects Viewed through binoculars, he estimates the ob- ject at 50 feet long. While he watched, the object at one point shot up \"among the stars,\" then it came back down to its previous low altitude. During the sighting, Frank became ill with headache, nausea, numbness, dizziness, and felt faint. Following the sighting, those symptoms were gone, but the back of his neck was throbbing and felt sore. While on the phone with Frank about one-half hour after the incident, I instructed him to look at his neck in the mirror, and he verbally reported two parallel horizontal red marks just to the right of the top of his spine. Whether this relates to the incident is not known, but it seems highly suspicious. Also during the sight- ing, Frank related that he felt at times as if his mind was \"more with it\" and he'd think reassuringly to him- self, \"I'm fine.\" But then he'd realize, \"Oh my God- I'm not fine.\" He described this effect on his mind as if a record would skip, then go back on track. Also, during the sighting, the family's two Labrador dogs began to howl. Blond female Frank's perception is that the incident lasted only five to ten minutes, but his mother (whom Frank called twice DURING the incident) has a much different time- line description and her account supports at least a 30- minute sighting. As recently as February, 1998, Frank woke in the night to see a blond female in a \"zippered blue\" gown-like item of apparel standing in the door- way of his room, with a light behind her. Wondering if he was awake, he deliberately looked around his bed- room to see if everything was in its place. It was. And then he blacked out. Next morning when he awoke, he was tired, exhausted, physically drained. What happened when he blacked out?

That much was not kept hidden from him. It is obvious to me that there is an agenda here in which the aliens are no longer interested in having the family unaware of their pres- ence. Now, the family has questions-all over the place! Apprehensions (downright fear) about what's happening to them. Role of the investigator As a field investigator (and an abductee since child- hood myself) what am I going to do when faced with a situation such as this? Am I going to leave these people out there TWISTING IN THE WIND OF THEIR OWN IGNORANCE? This might be the approach some in- vestigators would use, i.e. leave the witnesses in igno- rance, get better uncontaminated information as time goes on and their experiences continue. I can't do that. Now that statement does not mean that I'm going to push information at them, nor will I \"come out of the closet\" and share my experiences and advice with them if they show no signs of needing to probe further into their own experiences. But these days, it seems to me, people are more willing to look at what's happen- ing and want to pursue their own \"need to know.\" It may even be that the alien \"big push\" has been delib- erately orchestrated in order to bring an investigator/ abductee like myself into contact with this family. I have to seriously consider that my own concern for the psychological welfare and stability of abductees may actually coincide with a similar alien concern. In interaction with abduction witnesses, I talk about their need to read about the experiences of others. I recommend substantive research (yes, that's a judg- ment call), rather than sending them toward those who may think they've got the answers already neatly pack- aged into their own preferred category. I talk about coping. They DO bring us back. Yes, they seem to be utilizing us in some way, and we do not seem able to stop it. \"But,\" I say to them, \"There are others going through what you're going through- you're not alone. You are going to survive!\" And I talk about fear, and the need to face one's own fear with- out trying to escape it. More to life I talk about their own worth, and their solid, down- to-earth, feet-on-the-ground everyday, mundane, earn- a-living existence-into which they must now introduce the fact that life is composed of a wider slice of reality than they had previously thought. In trying to assess possible alien motives, the fol- lowing complexity within the family relationships needs to be noted. When MUFON was called in to in- vestigate the Aug. 7,1997, incident, it quickly became apparent that 11 -year-old Justin (although he had \"miss- ing time\" in the current incident) had not been taken seriously by his father when he had on several occa- sions reported strange happenings during the night and would run crying to his father's bedroom. In fact, his father had placed him in \"counseling,\" thinking this would solve his \"problem.\" From the beginning, I was concerned for this child. While he could talk to his grandmother and his uncle about his experiences, his father continued to shy away from the UFO subject, and even made disparaging re- marks to his own mother, Brenda, and his brother, Frank, about the sightings which were taking place at the family residence. My concern centered on the iso- lation this boy could be feeling and the possible con- sequences for his psychological welfare and stability. As time went by, his grandmother reported some be- havioral problems and said that he had become increas- ingly reticent on the subject of his experiences. A change in belief Then something happened which has (we are glad to observe) begun to alter this disbelief problem be- tween Justin and his father. On Feb. 9, 1998, shortly before noon, Brenda and her son, David (Justin's fa- ther), sighted a UFO at low altitude (about 500 feet) and only one-half mile away. Brenda was driving, so this left David free to get a good look at what he couldn't explain. And now he understands what other family mem- bers have been going through. Beyond that, it has be- come apparent that he's had some strange occurrences in his own life and now feels free to discuss those hap- penings, even in the presence of his own son. Which, for me, raises a further interesting question. Is it possible that the aliens might have (again) orches- trated a sighting? This time for the benefit of bringing some psychological balance into the life of an 11 -year- old who desperately needed his father's listening ear? (To say nothing of how it has benefited the father.) I don't know the full answer to my own question. I'm willing to entertain the possibility that there might be, in this case, an alien concern for the psychological welfare of family members involved in alien-human interaction. I must, of course, point out that possible alien concern could be coming from an alien-self-in- terest vantage point rather than from purely altruistic motivation. Whatever the answer may be, I see a badly needed improvement in this father-son relationship, fostered in part by three concerned investigators: Dr. Lawrence Lacey, Daryl Stangl, and myself-and, I be- lieve, also favored by the aliens. We await further developments."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 August 1998 MUFON UFO Journal The UFO PRESS Star People Dr. John E. Mack by Jim Sparks. Reviewed by Dr. John E. Mack, Harvard Uni- versity, professor, psychiatrist, abduction re- searcher, author, and member of the MUFON Board of Directors. Vast numbers of Americans are having experiences which have come to be known as the \"alien abduction phenomenon. \" Despite the readiness of people who are not familiar with the details of the phenomenon to offer psychiatric or other conven- tional explanations, none of these has even begun to ac- count for the strange nature, richness, and awesome power of these experiences. Those who are willing to pay atten- tion to what is going on here are confronted with an in- triguing mystery of expand- ing scope. Jim Sparks' case has many of the features that have been reported now in hundreds of instances, but it is also unusual in several respects. His account provides one of our richest and most detailed documentation of an abduction history. In addition, he shows clearly how the experiences evolved, together with shifts in his own consciousness. But above all. Sparks' recall is alto- gether conscious, i.e., without the benefit of hypnosis, relaxation exercises, or any of the other uses of a non- ordinary state of consciousness for the exploration of buried memories. This should help to settle what may still remain of the suspicion that these experiences are somehow the product of a narrator trying to please a hypnotist. As for myself, I met Jim Sparks for the first time in March of 1996, and although we have had two in- terviews and several other conversations, 1 cannot be regarded as complicit in bringing forth his knowledge, as his book was far along before we ever met. Something important to teach us Sensing that he has something important to teach us, Sparks has avoided reading about abductions lest his prior knowledge contaminate the account. Never- theless, his story is in many ways consistent with the narratives and lives or other abductees I have seen or whose cases have been published. He has the passion, curiosity, and self doubt of an authentic, truthful voice. There would be little reason to question the reality of what he has written, except for the fact that from the standpoint of the materialistic world view that still dominates our culture, what Sparks has to tell us is simply not possible. We are then faced with the choice of rejecting his story prima facie, or allowing ourselves to expand our notions of the possible by attending to what he has to say. Jim Sparks is an Italian American in the commer- cial real estate business. The experiences that he re- members began a decade ago. He has been informed by the alien beings that they are concentrating their contact now upon ordinary people (he regards himself as an \"average person\") because agreements with earth's leaders to \"correct the environmental condition of your planet\" were violated. Furthermore, Sparks is so convinced that information about alien cultures and activity of great importance for human health and the future of the earth has been illegally suppressed by gov- ernment officials that he is vigorously pursuing a Na- tional Security Information Amnesty Bill that would allow records to be opened and these individuals to come forward with what they know without fear of reprisal. Initially, Sparks' experiences, which occurred as often as several times a month, were typically intru- sive and terrifying, including the forced extraction of sperm that has so often been reported. Furthermore, he had been brought into a \"mind-boggling\" world where known physical laws were broken, including passage through solid objects, shape-shifting, and in- stant, apparently thought-activated transport. Some- thing, Sparks tells us, had \"invaded my being right down to the core.\" A process, totally outside of his control, had befallen him which utterly broke down his will, \"probing through to the deepest fiber of my mind.\" Sparks tried desperately to relate what was hap- pening to him to familiar notions, thinking at first that he was being taken over by evil spirits. Acceptance Little by little, Sparks was able to put aside his rage, overcome fear, and accept that he was encoun- tering some sort of technologically advanced non-hu- man intelligence from which he could not escape, be- ings with the \"ability to scan the deepest fibers of your soul,\" before which he was quite powerless. As he was able to surrender, the experiences transformed. Sparks found that he had been inducted into a kind of \"alien boot camp,\" a school of training and testing that made heavy use of riddles, ambiguity, paradox and symbol- ogy, where much of the communication occurred tele- pathically, or via connection with the aliens' dark, mys- terious eyes."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1998 Page 11 The purpose of this schooling appears to be two- fold: to create a hybrid race as an \"insurance policy\" for the future, and to awaken us to our mindless de- structiveness so that we may halt the devastation we are bringing to the planet. The human race is \"isolated\" in the cosmos \"by ignorance\" he has learned, \"not ready to join the intelligent life that exists in other realms,\" and \"too dangerous to be set free in the universe to do as we please.\" Never quite trusting Sparks never becomes quite clear or trusting of the aliens' \"agenda,\" wondering, for example, whether they are using us to collect \"spare parts\" for their own pur- poses. But over time he came \"to feel quite fortunate to have somehow been chosen to participate\" in such a great \"adventure,\" and he is unwavering in his con- viction that we must heed the beings' warning in order to stop the destruction of the environment and prevent the death of the planet. The central message is stressed repeatedly and re- lentlessly in Sparks' book, and is the reason for its power. Through Sparks, the beings, or whatever may be the intelligence beyond this extraordinary phenom- enon, tell of our failed stewardship of this magnificent planet. In several of his abductions Sparks was shown on television-like monitors scenes of such breathtak- ing natural beauty that they \"left me completely mes- merized.\" But these would inevitably be followed by visions of \"mankind's destructive ways,\" as the moni- tors showed once beautiful forests \"now brown gray and dead looking instead of healthy and green.\" An- other scene showed dead bloated fish floating on top of the water. Sparks writes, \"This made me feel very sad and depressed.\" Suddenly, after one of these ex- periences, a telepathic voice said, \" YOU ARE KILL- ING YOUR PLANET. YOUR PLANET IS DYING\" (capitalized in Sparks' manuscript). Dangers to the planet In some of his experiences Sparks was confronted with the dangers of overpopulation, breaks in the food chain, and the dangers of nuclear and biological con- tamination. \"There are better ways,\" he was told, of \"deriving your energy and food needs, without caus- ing your planet any damage.\" Our mindlessness seems, in Sparks' experiences, to have cosmic proportions. \"In the galactic neighborhood,\" he was taught, \"there seems to be an order\" which our species is violating. Why not just stop us? In a certain sense, the reality or truth of all this is well known, so why should we pay attention to Jim Sparks, who has been informed by strange beings we do not even acknowledge exist? And if the aliens are so concerned with the earth's ecology, why don't they just stop us? These are difficult questions to answer. First, there is the emotional and transforming power of the environmental \"education\" for Sparks and many other abductees, which leads to a more total kind of commitment to changing our direction. Also, there is the sense in these experiences that the message com- ing from a higher or divine source of great potency should be able to acknowledge its authority. Finally, as Sparks and other experiencers have been told, the changes that may result from \"training\" like his must occur through shifts in consciousness of the human race, especially on the part of ordinary people, rather than by direct intervention. With the failure of leaders to take responsibility for the planet's plight, Sparks was told, \"We are now concentrating our en- ergy on the average person. Sparks writes of changes in his own conscious- ness and psychic powers, an \"ability to see in other dimensions,\" and a \"sixth and seventh sense.\" These extra senses seem to lie dormant like an atrophied muscle,\" he says. \"One just needs the tools or technol- ogy to tap into these realms. In my case, exposure to alien technology heightens the senses.\" Leadership by example Sparks is to be commended for having the courage to \"come out\" and tell his remarkable story. Many experiencers are ridiculed privately and publicly for truths that run so counter to the official reality of our culture. He hopes that if he can provide the example of leadership in this regard, he may contribute to over- coming the denial that characterizes the prevailing re- action to the great dangers facing the earth. To the end, Sparks, like all abductees, remains mystified as to the source of his experiences, but feels that what he has learned is of immense power, importance and cred- ibility. \"What is wrong with us then,\" he asks at the end of the book. \"Are we blind? Maybe so, because it is taking cultures from God knows where to warn us.\" I asked Sparks to tell me how his experiences had changed him. In a letter sent to me by fax, he wrote: Prior to 1988 (when he began to recall his experi- ences), about 95% of my energy was focused on busi- ness, marriage, recreation, and living as carefree as possible. 1 had some concern for the environment. I tried to save as many trees as possible when I bought land and sold lots for home sites. My experience with advanced cultures in the last nine years changed my life and expanded my aware- ness. My life has changed to the point that I am form- ing a foundation that will purchase and preserve valu- able forest land."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 August 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Roswell's International UFO Museum and Research Center setting ambitious goals By Dwight Connelly If the ambitious plans of those operating the Inter- national UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, NM, are eventually realized, the results will be significant in terms of education and research. The vision for the museum, says Director Deon Crosby, is to become a \"UFO Central,\" defined.as \"an all-encompassing complex, serving everyone from the family vacationer to the serious researcher.\" While the museum already serves the family vacationer reason- ably well, making the museum a mecca for serious re- searchers is still on the drawing board. Limited re- search is now possible in the small library on the sec- ond floor, but this is far from what Crosby and Board of Directors President Glenn Davis envision. \"We want to be the clearing house for UFO information,\" says Crosby, \"not just the place where information is gath- ered. The next level involves technically compiling, storing, and distributing this information.\" The research material has already begun to arrive. Two significant collections were received by the mu- seum in March from George D. Fawcett of Lincolnton, NC, and E. R. (Bob) Sabo of St. Petersburg, FL. Fawcett's collection of 20,685 items and the estimated 15,000 items in Sabo's collection include a total of 8,000 letters, 3,244 journals and newsletters, 2,000 magazine articles, 1,600 sighting questionnaires, 900 tabloid articles, 850 slides, 900 hardback and paper- back books, 610 photos, 500 Freedom of Information documents, 1,200 magazines, 400 related file folders, 342 clipping service editions, 65 audio/VHS tapes, 37 filing cabinets, 15 albums, 9 records, 10 scrapbooks, and 3 miscellaneous items. Fawcett has reportedly investigated more than 1,200 sightings, has lectured extensively, written a num- ber of articles, and been involved in UFO groups in New England, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Florida, New York, and North Carolina. He has been a member or field investigator for Aerial Phenomena Research Or- ganization (APRO), the National Investigations Com- mittee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the Scientific Bureau of Investigations (SBI) in New York, the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), and the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON). Sabo was a field investigator and member of the investigative subcommittee for the National Investi- gations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) from 1964 to 1980, at that time headed by Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe and Richard H. Hall. He was founder of the UFO Research Organization of St. Petersburg, FL (1964-69), through which he published monthly news- letters. \"We will be cataloging these collections by cat- egory,\" says Crosby, \"with the name of the donor stamped on each item.\" As many organi- zations, including MUFON, have discov- ered, it is often a difficult road from good inten- tions to actually getting material cataloged and distributed. One of the first goals for the mu- seum is to preserve items Deon Crosby which are valuable, but falling apart. Crosby says that optical character recognition (OCR) equipment will be utilized to copy materials that are too fragile for handling by researchers. \"We may never get this completely caught up,\" she says. \"We have already received three smaller col- lections, and expect to continually receive more mate- rials. We'll be hiring more people, and we have rented the building next to us so we can move the library there. This will triple the size of our present library.\" Crosby says that another immediate goal is to transfer research material to CD's with search facilities. \"We hope to have at least some of these done by next spring.\" The big plans, however, are much more extensive and expensive. The museum has already taken an op- tion on 25 acres located west of Roswell on U.S. Route 70. The goal is to build a $7.5 million interactive UFO and space museum with a state-of-the-art Research Center that would house a full-service library/archive, computer terminals for use by the public, an interna- tional UFO reporting center and database, areas dedi- cated to children's learning activities, administrative offices, lecture facilities, and a gift shop. The goal is to break ground by 2001, and fundraising for the non- profit organization is underway. Part of this effort will involve expanding the Board of Directors to make the board more international, says Crosby. Currently, funds are coming in through donations"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1998 Page 13 The International UFO Museum and Research Center on Main Street, Roswell. from visitors to the museum, gift shop proceeds, grant monies from the Roswell Lodgers Tax Fund and the New Mexico Tourism Department, and a membership program. There is no charge for touring the museum, but visitors are encouraged to drop donations in a con- venient jar near the entrance. Studies by the museum indicate that gift shop proceeds and contributions both increase with no admission fees. Attendance has jumped from 1,494 in 1992 to 192,124 in 1997. Through the first five months of this year, an average of 432 visitors have signed in each day, seven days a week. Mayflower Tours, based in Illinois, has committed to bringing 288 tour busses through Roswell this year, and other tour companies are adding Roswell, according to Crosby. \"We believe our attendance will surpass 300,000 this year.\" Those wanting to support the museum are offered five types of memberships: General, $25; Sustaining, $50; Participating, $100; Sponsor/Commercial, $250; and Lifetime, $1,000. There is also a $250 funding/ sponsorship special membership for the library pro- gram. The address of the museum is 114 N. Main, Roswell, NM 88201.

As usual at these gatherings, for me the best part was renewing acquaintances, such as Ann Druffel; meeting new people, such as Michael and Deborah Lindemann; and discussing current topics with the speakers and attendees. Even the opportunity to argue with skeptic Phil Klass was welcome. Following is a brief sketch of presentations by the speakers. The complete text of each talk is included in the 192-page MUFON 1998 UFO Symposium Pro- ceedings, available from MUFON's home office for $25.00, plus $1.75 for postage and handling. Ann Druffel, who has stud- ied the UFO phenomenon for 41 years, presented a welcome and compelling account of the work of the late Dr. James E. McDonald, who made outstanding contribu- tions to ufology between 1958 and his death in 1971. Ann, the author of The Tujunga Canyon Contacts, as well as How to Defend Yourself Against Alien Abductions (due out in August), has just finished a biography of Dr. McDonald. David Jacobs, associate professor of history at Temple University and the author of The Threat: The Secret Alien Agenda (1998), gave a very interest- ing talk entitled \"Thinking Clearly About the Alien Phenomenon.\" In contrast to his statement in The Threat, to the effect that he now knows what the aliens are up to, Dr. Jacobs said in his talk that all con- clusions must be tentative: \"All knowledge is subject to change as new evidence is developed.\" Throughout his presentation, he empha- sized how improper procedures by researchers can re- sult in widely varying results and conclusions, and how important it is for those conducting hypnosis to stan- dardize procedures and analyze what they are getting. Dr. Joe Lewels, author of The God Hypoth- esis: Extraterrestrial Life and Its Implications for Sci- ence and Religion (1997), contrasted those who see aliens as part of a recent sinister plot to take over the Ann Dr. Jacobs world with those who see aliens as longtime manipu- lators of mankind as part of human evolution. Dr. Lewels, unfortunately, has become enamored with what is now a tiresome theme of taking Dr. David Jacobs to task for real or imagined rebukes of other researchers. Practicing what he criticizes Jacobs for allegedly do- ing, he attempts .to imply guilt by association by placing Jacobs with \"religious fundamentalists and members of our secret govern- ment.\" While there is certainly Dn Lewels room for disagreement with Dr. Jacobs' book, Lewel's critique has deteriorated into what appears to be a poorly documented personal attack. Other than this, which unfortunately made up a substantial part of his talk, Dr. Lewels presented an interesting and provocative review of ancient texts which indicate that the aliens may have been part of civilization since the beginning of recorded history- or even before. This, as Dr. Lewels noted, was a theme discussed many years ago by Rev. Barry Downing in articles in Skylook, the MUFON UFO Journal, and his book, The Bible and Flying Saucers. Dr. Richard Haines, who developed and di- rected NASA's \"High Luminance Vision Laboratory,\" presented an intriguing talk concerning human initiated contact with UFOs through signaling or otherwise contacting the objects in some manner. Dr. Haines, the author of many publi- cations, discussed 27 cases, taken from a longer review of 250 cases. The research indicated that there is Dr - Haines indeed evidence that UFOs sometimes respond to sig- nals or actions by humans. Deborah Lindemann, a certified, registered clinical hypnotherapist, discussed the abduction phenomenon from the perspective of how consciousness may shape the perception that abductees have of their experiences. Discussing the Allagash abduction case, the experiences of lifelong abductee Katarina Wilson, the case of Nancy Malacaria (and her hus- D - Lindemann band), and the case of Steve Neill, Lindmann concludes that each abductee brings something unique to the ex- perience, that this has an important bearing on how they react to the encounters, and that the state of con- sciousness has a significant influence on the abductee's perception. Jose Escamilla, a video producer/director, pre-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1998 Page 15 Escamilla M. Lindemann sented videos of what are called \"rods,\" which are al- legedly mysterious objects which look like centipedes, white rods, or spears in the air. He explained that these were first captured acciden- tally, and he initially thought the ob- jects were birds or insects which had flown past his camera. Later, Escamilla discovered that high- speed shutter (172000 to 1 /10,000) resulted in good details of the \"rods,\" which seem to be living creatures which can perform extraordinary maneuvers. Although his first experience with \"rods\" came in an area southeast of Roswell, NM, where UFOs were allegedly captured on video, no link with ufology has been established. Michael P. Lindemann, editor and publisher of CM News, an important subscription-based Internet source for up-to-date UFO information, presented extensive evidence indicating that there is now a general consensus that extraterres- trial life exists. He feels that there are enough scientists subscribing to this idea that \"we may be on the brink of winning the 50-year battle for scientific ac- ceptance of UFO evidence on its own merits.\" John F. Schuessler, author of UFO-Related Human Physi- ological Effects (1996) and The Cash-Landrum UFO Incident: Three Texans Are Injured During an Encounter with a UFO and Military Helicopters (1998), discussed the technological issues involved with UFOs. With a background in engi- neering involving most of the U.S. manned space programs, Schuessler made a compelling case for UFOs being physically real objects. He based this conclusion on the following characteristics of UFOs: shape, performance, lighting, and effects on the surrounding environment (includ- ing humans, animals, and vehicles). Schuessler con- cluded his talk by suggesting that the military make use of devices such as laser radar, all light-level TV and infrared detection, digital video memory, acoustic detection, and optical tracking. He also suggested that investigators invest in such items as Geiger counters in order to fully document cases. Stanley V. McDaniel, author of The McDaniel Report on Martian anomalies and co-editor of The Case for the Face: Scientists Examine the Evidence for Alien Artifacts on Mars (1998), discussed what he termed Schuessler Dr. McDaniel Torme \"the actual situation as far as the Mars Global Surveyor is con- cerned.\" Although one of the more conservative advocates for investi- gating \"the face,\" McDaniel ex- plained that there is enough evidence of artificiality to warrant additional study of the area known as Cydonia. Tracy Torme, TV and film writer and producer, discussed the problem of getting accurate UFO material onto movie and TV screens. He was on the staff of Star Trek: The Next Generation, then served as writer/producer for \"Intruders,\" which depicted the tran- sition of Dr. John Mack from psychia- trist to UFO abduction researcher. In 1985 he optioned the book The Walton Experience and wrote a screenplay which he called Fire in the Sky\" the film being released in 1993. While the film was reportedly successful at the box office, Torme said he was disap- pointed that he was forced to change much of the fac- tual material in order to make the film acceptable to producers. He said the biggest problem with produc- ers is their skepticism and \"profound ignorance\" of the UFO scene, along with the \"true believers\" who give ufology a bad image. Nancy Talbott, a member of the BLT Research team which in- cludes John A. Burke and William C. Levengood, has been investigating crop circles since 1989. Their re- search indicates that genuine crop circles have characteristics which separate them from hoaxes. A com- plete article in the September Jour- nal will take a detailed look at their research. Jaime Maussan, investiga- tive journalist, general producer, and anchorman of the TV show \"Tercer Milenio,\" broadcast to many coun- tries from Mexico City, presented a series of UFO films and videos. The most impressive of these was the Aug. 6, 1997, video shot in Mexico City, described in the December, 1997, and the April, 1998, issues of the MUFON UFO Journal. At the symposium, photo analyst Jeff Sainio told Maussan that he now thinks the video was faked (see story on Page 16). Maussan contends, how- ever, that there were multiple witnesses. Talbott Maussan"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 August 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Mexico City UFO video called a hoax by researcher Jeff Sainio By Michael Lindemann CNINews It could have been the \"smoking gun\" of UFO evidence, a clear daylight UFO video reportedly shot over Mexico City on Aug/6,1997, that seemed to pass many tests of authenticity. Now, professional video analyst Jeff Sainio has told CNI News that he is sure that the Las Lomas video is a fake. Sainio, long associated with MUFON, says he spent more than 400 hours analysing the video and refining computer algorithms for measuring tiny move- ments within the video image. \"All the measurements were done by machine, so there's no human bias what- soever,\" he said. He and Bruce Maccabee had earlier studied the photo, reaching no firm conclusion, and their analysis was published in the April, 1998, issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. Sitting in the lobby of the Denver Renaissance Hotel during the recent MUFON International Sym- posium, Sainio showed me several damning pieces of evidence on his laptop computer. Easiest to see was a glaring discrepancy between the \"smearing\" of back- ground images in some frames and \"no smearing\" of the UFO itself in the same frames. \"In a hand-held video shot, images are smeared or blurred due to motion of the camcorder,\" Sainio ex- plained. \"In this video, everything in the field is smeared due to the camera motion except the UFO. That's be- cause the UFO wasn't there when the video was taken. It was added later.\" The process of making such a fake wasn't ex- pensive, but it was time-consuming, Sainio said. He surmised it was done as follows: \"Somebody went on that balcony and took the [background] video, then broke it down frame by frame, laboriously measured the position of some reference object in there, and used that as a template to paste in an animation file of the spinning UFO. They performed a 'paste on lighter' command, which can be done in any image editor. Since the UFO is darker than the sky, but brighter than the buildings, it will seamlessly go behind buildings.\" Sainio said he had added other UFOs to the video to test his theory. \"The software I used to do this was free off the internet,\" he said. He then described another proof of fakery. \"The UFO flies over some windsocks on the buildings. If you watch the UFO as it flies over the second windsock, you'll see the camera rotate as part of the bouncing of the hand-held shot,\" he said. \"It only rotates 1.6 de- grees-not very much. Of course, the UFO is also wob- bling back and forth. But if you very carefully measure the angle of the UFO at that point, you'll see that ev- erything in the field of view rotates this 1.6 degrees- everything except the UFO. Its wobbling is completely unaffected by the rotation of the camera, another indi- cation that it's a fraud.\" Sainio said his detailed, illustrated report on the Mexico video will be submitted to the Journal. Immediately after speaking with CNI News, Sainio presented his analysis to researcher Jaime Maussan, also'a participant at the Denver MUFON Symposium. Maussan then described his reaction: \"I have to respect someone who has spent 400 hours analysing this video. Nobody else has been able to demonstrate whether it is real or not,\" Maussan said. \"As you know, I am not a scientist, and I don't under- stand all the details. If there are more scientists that arrive at this conclusion, I will have to believe more and more that this is probably a hoax.\" But, Maussan says, he must weigh Sainio's opin- ion against the weight of multiple eyewitnesses-espe- cially the testimony of one young girl. \"The problem for me is that I found a girl, Cassandra, who had not seen the video. I interviewed her before she saw any video. And she describes exactly what is in there. Her father remembers that day. Her father told her that she was crazy when she said that there was a UFO outside the house. She asked him to come outside to see the UFO. He was tired, so he didn't go out. For two months he told her she was crazy. Then I arrived there, and she was so happy and excited because I was there to prove that she had seen it. How can you tell that girl that she is lying?\" Maussan exclaimed. There are other witnesses, too. \"I found all kinds of witnesses-little boys, a woman, people together, a girl who said she was burned on her skin and has suf- fered in her thyroid since then,\" Maussan said. \"Of course, many of them could be contaminated because I presented this on television. But not Cassandra.\" \"How can a computerized UFO hoax create skin bums in some of the witnesses, or frighten the ani- mals, or make people living there call the radio sta- tions to send their helicopters to see what was flying close to their houses that day... in the same area that the video shows?\" added Daniel Munoz in a written message to CNI News. Munoz, an investigator for the widely watched Mexican television program Tercer Milenio, anchored by Maussan, has been deeply in- volved in the Las Lomas case from the beginning."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1998 Page 17 Col. Philip Corso dies in Florida Col. Philip J. Corso (U.S. Army, ret.) died of a heart attack at approximately 11:15 p.m. EOT on Thurs- day, July 16, 1998. He was 83. Corso, who was widely known for his contro- versial 1997 book, The Day After Roswell, had suf- fered a massive heart attack in early June of this year, but seemed to have made a remarkable recovery. \"He really wanted to stay,\" Corso's son, Philip Jr., told CNI News. \"The last three weeks [since the first attack] have been very productive. I knew he had more to say, and he told me a great deal about the Roswell UFO incident.\" Col. Corso was at home on July 15 and was said to be feeling fine when he apparently suffered a second heart attack at about 9:00 a.m. He was taken to a hospital in nearby Palm Beach, FL, for treatment, but his condition deterioriated. Doctors decided to transfer him on that evening to Jupiter Medical Center, where he had been treated for his earlier attack. Col. Corso reportedly died at about the time he reached the Jupiter facility. . Unpublished manuscripts and other UFO-re- lated information left by Col. Corso will be protected and made available in due course to researchers and the public, Philip Jr. said. \"This is what my father lived for,\" he added. Col. Corso was a highly decorated soldier, re- ceiving 30 medals and commendations during his long military career. According to Philip Jr., the Colonel was most proud to have received the Knight Officer Crown of Italy for his exceptional service in Italy during and after World War II. Philip Jr. said that Col. Corso is the only American soldier to have received this honor from Italy. Col. Corso was buried in a military cemetery near Orlando, FL.

Pennsylvania farmer reports UFO By Stan Gordon I have received the following information from Dan Hageman of the Butler Organization For Research of the Unexplained (BORU) in Butler County, PA. BORU is investigating a low level [low altitude] UFO incident which occurred about 3:30 a.m. on May 7, 1998, in a rural area of Butler County. The primary witness, who prefers to remain anonymous, is a farmer who was doing some late night planting of a corn field. He was riding on his tractor when he noticed brilliant lights near a wheat field, es- timated to be about 200 to 400 yards away..At first he became upset, thinking that someone was driving through the wheat. He soon was able to observe an object moving about 4 to 5 feet above the ground. The object was approximately 30 to 40 feet long, about 4 to 5 feet tall, and of a dark color. It was dome shaped in the front with a light, but the structure thinned out towards the back and rounded off. Towards the front section of the object, there were 5 to 6 lights along the edge on both sides. There were about 5 lights in the same position on both sides towards the back of the object. These lights were described as very bright, square in shape, and orange, blue and light pink in color. The lights seemed to pulsate on and off, but never went out completely. The entire object appeared to be sur- rounded in a vapor or gas. As the witness was turning to make another pass of the field, he began to have some problems with the equipment he was using. His tractor began to sputter, but did not shut off. A monitor on the tractor, used for corn planting, was making a constant beeping and had to be shut down. As the farmer watched, the object moved in a straight line, barely clearing the tree tops estimated at 60 feet high, when suddenly the object appeared to evaporate into thin air and was no longer seen. Further information is expected on this case. I have received some soil samples taken from the site, which I will turn over to one of my associates for a laboratory analysis.

Of the three, the Walton case is unique in the fact that there were six witnesses in addition to the abductee. Yet, despite the passage of more than 22 years with none of the witnesses changing their testimony, there are still debunkers who treat the case as a hoax. It is this aspect that bothers Walton the most. \"I thought that all the things I put in my book-the eye- witnesses, the lie detector tests, and all the rest-would convince even the doubters,\" he says. \"That's the most frustrating part of the whole thing-not to be be- lieved.\" He is especially concerned that it has been an unnecessary burden for his wife, Dana, and his four children. \"Kids at school can be pretty cruel,\" he notes. \"I'll guarantee one thing. I would never intentionally get close to a UFO again, and if I ever had any sort of encounter, I would never tell anyone.\" For her part, Dana never wavers in her certainty that the abduction took place. They were dating at the time, and she explains that she was \"very wor- ried\" when Travis disappeared for five days, fearing the worst, but has no doubts that the event happened as described by Travis and the other crew members. Dana's brother, Mike Rogers, was in charge of the seven-man logging crew. One of the more interesting aspects of the case is the fact that Walton has taken no pains to describe his witnesses-the other crew members-in a positive light. In his book, The Walton Experience (revised as Fire in the Sky to relate to the film made from it), Travis frankly describes one of the crew members as having an \"uncontrollable temper,\" and \"a way of picking fights he never finished.\" Other crew mem- bers are also frankly described. Asked if he cleared these descriptions with the people involved, he said he had not. Asked if he had received any negative feedback from the crew members, he replied, \"What could they say. It's the truth.\" Life for most members of the crew did not go smoothly after the incident. Mike Rogers and his wife divorced, and he and Travis were no longer friends for a time after the abduction, despite being brothers- in-law. The crew member with \"the bad temper\" got into difficulties with the law. Steve and his wife di- vorced, but he remarried. John and his wife divorced, but he also remarried. Ken and his wife also divorced. (Continued on Page 19) Travis and Dana Walton. The Incident Seven members of a tree-clearing crew were on their way home in the rugged Mogollon Rim Forest on Nov. 5, 1975, when they spotted a strange glow in the trees in an area known as Turkey Springs. Investigating, they came upon a UFO hovering in a clearing. Travis Walton got out of the vehicle, despite the protests of the other five crew members. He walked under the UFO, a beam shot from it, and he was propelled backwards through the air. He landed in a heap and appeared to the other crew members to be dead. Nearly wild with fright, they tore from the woods in their old crew cab pickup. When convinced the object was not following, the crew leader, Mike Rogers, who was Walton's best friend, decided they should go back and see about Travis. When they returned to the location, they could find no sign of Walton. They notified law enforcement authorities, and a manhunt was conducted over several days. Walton was not found. There was suspicion that the crew members might have murdered him, so they volunteered to take lie detector tests. Cy Gilson, one of the top lie detector examiners in the nation, reported that all had passed except for Allen Dalis, who seemed to be too emotion- ally distraut to be tested properly. About midnight on the fifth day, Travis awoke near the little town of Heber, stumbled into town, called his sister, and was picked up by his brother-in-law, Grant, and his brother, Duane. APRO called in Dr. James Harder, their director of research, and he advised against an early lie detector test because of the stress that Walton was still under. A test was arranged, however, and the results were scrapped as meaningless, but psychiatric tests and hyp- nosis convinced three psychiatrists that Walton was tell- ing the truth. Three months later a second lie detector test was passed by Walton. In 1993, Walton, Dalis, and Rogers were retested by Gilson and again passed. V"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1998 Page 19 Dwayne returned to Oklahoma to work as an electri- cian and raise a family. \"I don't think any of these di- vorces were directly caused by the incident,\" says Travis. \"Not only do I not see the incident as a wedge between these couples, it seemed like nearly every one of us sought the arms of a woman in our readjustment to life. I think the biggest effect the incident had on all of us was loss of ego. I could write off that change to general maturity if it hadn't coincided so directly with the incident. We all lost some of our feeling of power and control.\" Walton acknowledges that at least one good thing has come from the experience. \"Before the abduction I was a little wild,\" he admits. \"I guess that's why I was the only one to get out of the truck and go up to the UFO. When I was younger and growing up in Payson, I was considered a bit of a bookworm, a nerd, a little professor. When I moved to Snowflake, I guess I went too far in the other direction. But after the abduction I calmed down. I now take a broader view of things. I think before I act. I believe it has also helped me be a better parent. I go to PTA meetings. I attend things my kids are in. I don't take my family for granted.\" Those who have not read Walton's book might have the idea that he is an uneducated backwoods hick whose only talent is operating a chain saw. Even some who have read his book might believe that the writing is just too good to be his. Those who have an opportunity to talk with him, however, quickly become aware of his intelligence and skill with the English language. His high school record was good enough to earn him schol- arships at three universities, and he did attend Northern Arizona University. With almost unlimited interests in everything, he kept changing his major-electronic en- gineering, law, psychology, medicine, liberal studies. Eventually he dropped out of college and began work- ing in the woods with his friend Mike Rogers. Travis is not cutting timber these days, having taken a job at the local paper mill. With some college credits behind him, he is toying with the idea of going back to school. \"The only problem is,\" he jokes, \"I've got kids to feed.\" Their oldest, a 20-year-old son, is out of school and employed, and their 17-year-old daughter will be entering college this fall, having graduated early from high school. The two remaining children are 15 and 12. Dana works as a receptionist in an orthodontist's office, and the Waltons still live in Snowflake, AZ, since both have strong ties to the area. Turning to the film version of his book, Travis says that Fire in the Sky \"gets the emotional part okay, but they took serious liberties with some of the facts.\" He doesn't blame Tracy Tonne, who did the screenplay. \"I know it's hard to do anything with Hollywood,\" says Travis. \"Tracy had to make some choices. Do what they want, or don't have a film.\" There has been talk, he says, of another group buying rights to the film from Paramount and remaking it in a more accurate manner. Tonne, son of singer Mel Torme, noted at the recent MUFON Symposium that he \"held out against changing it, but I was outvoted about ten to one. Paramount made it clear: radically revamp the alien sequence or the proverbial plug would be pulled.\" The film reached number one at the box office, and did make money for Paramount, according to Torme. Those who want the true picture of the incident have to read Travis' book, however. The well-known research of Dr. David Jacobs and others indicates that abductees usually have multiple experiences, and that their children are likely to also be abductees. Asked about this, Travis said that, to the best of his knowledge, he has had no other experi- ences with abductions. He and Dana also say that there has been no indication that their children have had any encounters. \"So far as I know,\" says Travis, \"I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and too curious for my own good.\" An autographed copy of Fire in the Sky (book) is available for $24.95 plus $4.95 shipping/handling from Walton at P.O.

Therefore, like many other people of our country I am interested in the phenomenon of flying saucers. It is a fascinating subject that has inititated both scientific fiction fan- tasies and serious scientific research. I watch with great interest all reports of unidentified flying objects, and I hope that some day we will know more about this intriguing sub- ject. Dr. Harlow Shapley, the prominent astronomer, has stated that there is a probability that there is other life in the universe. I favor more research regarding this matter, and I hope that once and for all we can determine the true facts about flying saucers. Your maga- zine can stimulate much of the investigation and inquiry into this phe- nomenon through the publication of news and discussion material. This can be of great help in paving the way to a knowledge of one of the fascinating subjects of our contemporary world. Sincerely, Robert J. Kennedy The above signed letter from Sen. Kennedy was written to the late Gray Barker 30 years ago. A copy was sent to Walt Andrus by Paul C.

But the panel did not suggest that any of this evidence points to a violation of known natural laws or the involvement of an extraterrestrial intelligence. The review was organized and directed by Peter Sturrock, professor of applied physics at Stanford Uni- versity, a long-time advocate of scientific study of the UFO phenomenon. It was supported administratively by the Society for Scientific Exploration, which pro- vides a forum for research into unexplained phenom- ena. The international review panel of nine physical scientists responded to presentations by eight investi- gators of UFO reports, who were asked to present their strongest data. Although UFO reports date back 50 years, the in- formation gathered does not prove that either unknown physical processes or alien technologies are implicated, according to the panel's report, but it does include a sufficient number of intriguing and inexplicable ob- servations. \"It may be valuable to carefully evaluate UFO reports to extract information about unusual phe- nomena currently unknown to science,\" concludes the panel. To be credible to the scientific community, \"such evaluations must take place with a spirit of objectivity and a willingness to evaluate rival hypotheses\" that has so far been lacking, it added. The panel focused on incidents involving some form of physical evidence, including photographic evi- dence, radar evidence, vehicle interference, interfer- ence with aircraft equipment, apparent gravitational or inertial effects, ground traces, injuries to vegetation, physiological effects on witnesses, and debris. Of par- ticular concern are reports that UFO encounters may be hazardous to people's health, since some witnesses have reportedly suffered radiation-type injuries. These reports led the panel to draw the attention of the medi- cal community to the possible health risks involved. The scientists found that some of the reported inci- dents may have been caused by rare natural phenom- ena, such as electrical activity high above thunderstorms or radar ducting (the trapping and conducting of radar waves by atmospheric channels). However, the panel found that some of the phenomena related to UFOs are not easy to explain in this fashion. Further evidence presented to the panel is unlikely to shed added light on the causes underlying the re- ports, the scientists said. Most current UFO investiga- tions lack the level of rigor required by the scientific community, despite the initiative and dedication of the investigators involved. But new data, scientifically ac- quired and analyzed, could yield useful information and advance our understanding of the UFO problem, the panel said. The reviewers also made the following observa- tions: 1 .The UFO problem is not a simple one, and it is unlikely that there is any simple, universal answer. 2.Whenever there are unexplained observations, there is the possibility that scientists will leam some- thing new by studying them. 3. Studies should concentrate on cases that include as much independent physical evidence as possible. 4.Continuing contact between the UFO commu- nity and physical scientists could be productive. 5.Institutional support for research in this area is desirable. The review panel consisted of Von R. Eshleman, professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford; Thomas Holzer, High Altitude Observatory in Boul- der, CO; Randy Jokipii, professor of planetary science, University of Arizona, Tucson; Francois Louange, managing director of Fleximage, Paris, France; H. J. Melosh, professor of planetary science, University of Arizona, Tucson; James J. Papike, professor of earth and planetary sciences, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque; Guenther Reitz, German Aerospace Cen- ter, Institute for Aerospace Medicine, Cologne, Ger- many; Charles Tolbert, professor of astronomy, Uni- versity of Virginia, Charlottesville; and Bernard Veyret, Bioelectromagnetics Laboratory, University of Bor- deaux, France. Eshleman and Holzer served as co- chairs of the panel. The UFO investigators who presented evidence were Richard Haines, Los Altos, CA; Illobrand von Ludwiger, Germany; Mark Rodeghier, Center for UFO Studies, Chicago; John Schuessler, Mutual UFO Net- work, Houston; Erling Strand, Ostfold College, Skjeberg, Norway; Michael Swords, professor of natu- ral science, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo; Jacques Vallee, San Francisco; and Jean-Jacques Velasco, CNES, Toulouse, France.

At that time the planet rises in the E at sunset and remains visible all night. The gleaming giant lies only ° degree above the full moon at midnight on the night of Sept. 6-7. Saturn (-0.1), on the Pisces-Cetus border, rises in the E about 8:30 p.m. in midmonth. The brightening planet (its opposition is next month) advances west- ward during the night. Saturn stands near the gibbous Moon on the 9th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mercury achieves a favorable morning elongation from the Sun low in the E not far from Venus at dawn. Venus (-3.9) itself remains visible for the first part of the month in the hour before sunrise. After that, it dis- appears in the solar glare. Mars (1.7), near the Cancer-Leo border, rises soon after 3 a.m. in midmonth and is found low in the E at dawn. The red planet is visible near the crescent Moon on Sept. 17. Jupiter shifts to the SW during the morning hours and then sets in the W at sunrise. Saturn moves to the SW at dawn. Penumbral Lunar Eclipse: Toward dawn on Sept. 6 the full moon grazes the Earth's shadow. Observers across most of North America should notice a slight darkening of the Moon's upper edge beginning shortly before 2 a.m. PDT (5 a.m. EOT). The Moon sets in the eastern states before our satellite's maximum penetration of the Earth's light outer shadow (penumbra) at 4:10 PDT. The Moon ex- its the outer shadow at 6:06 PDT. Moon Phases Full moon—Sept. 6 Last quarter—Sept. 12 New moon—Sept. 20 First quarter—Sept. 28 The Stars: The autumn sky symbol, the Great Square of Pe- gasus, has climbed into the SE and is just opposite its symbolic summer counterpart, the Summer Triangle. Pegasus, of course, is the Winged Horse in mythology, though it flies upside-down in the heavens. The hind legs of the animal, extending to the left from one cor- ner of the Great Square, actually belongs to the ad- joining Andromeda the Princess. Andromeda is one member of the constellation gathering known as the Royal Family. All are visible at once in the autumn sky. In the NE reside the parents of the princess, Cepheus the King and Cassiopeia the Queen. (Look for an upside-down \"house\"with peaked roof and crooked \"W,\" respectively, neither of which resembles the royal figures.) Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Ursa Major the Big Bear (in- cludes the Big Dipper), and Ursa Minor the Little Bear (Little Dipper) all revolve counterclockwise around a point near the Pole Star or North Star, never setting from northern latitudes. This circumpolar motion is merely the result of our Earth's own polar rotation be- neath the stars.

Tom Deuley feels that this is not a significant statistical num- ber at which to terminate the project, and recommended that it be reinstated. Dan Wright will return the com- puter and laser printer to MUFON so it may be assigned to his successor. (4) Tom Deuley and John Schuessler volunteered to write a proposal plan that will delineate MUFON goals, objectives, and projects, including the costs to fund each project, for submittal to Mrs. Carolyn McNellis, our fundraising director. A year ago Tom Whitmore prepared such a plan; however, the current one will be more extensive in scope, utilizing Mr. Whitmore's work. (5) The Board approved the purchase of a new com- puter and laser printer for the MUFON headquarters office, not to exceed $2,500. We will continue to use the current Compaq computer and printer for other projects. (6) Robert G. Turner, State Director for New Mexico, has recommended that the MUFON database of UFO sightings be converted from our present Para- dox program to a more current software program, such as Oracle. Mr. Turner will submit his proposal in the near future. Congratulations to Directors on Marriages Dan R. Wright was married July 7, 1998, in Lan- sing, MI to Shawn Schaeffer. John S. Carpenter and Debra Donham were joined in marriage on Aug. 1, 1998, in Springfield, MO. Our best wishes to both of these directors and their lovely spouses. Ralph N. Noyes Passes Away Ralph N,.

Vacancies on MUFON Board of Directors Due to the resignation of Mrs. Linda Murphy as Director of Public Education, a vacancy now exists on the MUFON Board of Directors for a person with both an educational background and a sincere interest in edu- cating the public on the UFO phenomenon. Next to resolving the UFO enigma, MUFON's second prime goal is public education. For anyone interested in fill- ing this important position, please mail a resume stating your qualifications and why you would like to become involved in this responsibility to Walt Andrus. MUFON is still seeking a Membership Director on the Board to not only devise programs to recruit new members, but to analyze and reduce the number of mem- bers who are not renewing their annual memberships. MUFON needs(a dynamic and qualified person to fill the voluntary position of Membership Director. Appli- cants should write to Walt Andrus, including a resume and your reasons for volunteering for this Board posi- tion. John F. Schuessler, Deputy Director for Adminis- tration, who recently retired from the aerospace indus- try, has agreed to temporarily fill this vital responsibil- ity of Membership Director until a director is found. These positions represent an opportunity to be an important part of the MUFON leadership.

Director of Associate Members Resigns It is with extreme regret that we announce that Tho- mas J. Lyon, Director of MUFON's Associate Mem- bers Auxiliary, recently resigned. He felt that his adult advisors had failed to support his ideas and activities. Investigation disclosed that his reasons for resigning were justified under the circumstances. We hope that Tom will reconsider his decision, since he is a very bright young man with leadership potential. (Continued on Page 23)"}]
