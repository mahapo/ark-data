Apart and independent from the Survey results, it is my opinion and conclusion that of- ficial acknowledgment we have been clandestinely in- teracting with an advanced, technologically superior extraterrestrial civilization would have no severe nega- tive impact on our society's moral, intellectual, cul- tural, religious, political or military foundations. I be- lieve the significant and simplistic reason is that mankind could never perceive as a threat a race of be- ings without genitalia. W hile there seems to be no doubt among Ufologists that our government is withholding information on UFOs. there is considerable debate on the reasons why they are doing so. The Alexander UFO Religious Crisis Survey: The Impact of UFOs and Their Occupants on Religion (hereinafter referred to as \"AUS.\" proposed by Stanton Friedman) was designed to address one of the generally held beliefs among UFO researchers and writers—that acknowledgment regard- ing the absolute reality of UFOs (and their extraterres- trial crew) would have a deleterious effect on religious beliefs and organizations, thereby causing some kind of a social collapse. My proposal to do a pilot survey of 1000 religious community leaders was sponsored by philanthropist Robert Bigelqw and The Bigelow Foundation. On March 8, 1994 I mailed 1000 pilot Surveys to pseudo-randomly selected religious bodies in the conti- nental United States. The names and addresses were obtained from PhoneDisc Reverse, Fall 1993. Surveys were sent to 563 Protestant churches (i.e., Presbyterian, Episcopal, Methodist, Baptist, Seventh Day Adventist, Lutheran, etc.), 396 Roman Catholic Churches, and 41 Synagogues. The Survey consisted of one 11 x 14 legal size paper (printed on both sides) and an addressed stamped return envelope. The introduction to the Survey was an intentionally brief paragraph to respect the busy schedules of the recipients. There was a section for comments and optional information regarding name, church, address and size of congregation. An over- whelming number of participants chose to include com- ments and remarks under each question. Also, many letters accompanied the completed survey. The project was closed on April 29, 1994. Five addi- tional Surveys were received after the closing date and were not included in the findings. Based upon the clos- ing date figures, the total number of Surveys returned was 230: 134 from Protestant churches, 86 from Roman Catholic churches and 10 from synagogues. A 23% re- sponse is statistically considered an overwhelming suc- cess; additionally, it should be noted that the Survey was sent by an individual and not a well-known com- pany, organization or foundation. The main thrust of the Survey was not only to clarify a position I felt was promulgated without proper re- search data by the UFO community-at-large, but to stimulate ideas and conversation within religious com- munities. Each of the eleven questions asked were con- scientiously (and vigorously) designed to avoid steering the responses in any direction. \"Hot wire\" words such as \"UFOs,\" \"aliens,\" \"Grays,\" \"abductions,\" \"contactees\" and \"hybrid babies\" were intentionally omitted to stay clear of terms suggesting tabloid sensationalism. I did not feel including the views of Ufologists on the subject would benefit the overall results of AUS or impact on its significance. ARE UFOs A THREAT TO RELIGION? Two UFO researchers who read the report were quick to question the basic premise of AUS. Where's the exam- ples, they asked. A cursory review of the UFO literature for this article (and the critics) gave me a vast number of examples from which to choose. To assuage my forget- ful critics I'd like to begin by quoting MUFON's Theology consultant, Barry H. Downing, Ph.D. from his article \"Holy Communion?\" (MUFON UFO Journal, April, 1987): \"Up to the present time, there has been lit- tle interest in the Christian community in the UFO is- sue.\" In \"UFOs & Religion: The French Connection\" (MU- FON UFO Journal, June, 1988), Dr. Downing states: \"On the basis of my own experience, I know formal theology is not ready to begin a dialogue concerning the meaning of UFOs—I have called out. and no one has an- swered. \"The government lie about UFOs has kept the media, and therefore our religious institutions, from carrying on the religious debate that the UFO concept demands. \"Let us make no mistake about how revolutionary an idea this will be to our religious institutions (and by our, I mean the Judeo-Christian tradition, the main reli- gion of Western culture and of America).\" SEPTEMBER 1994 NUMBER 31 7 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL In light of the Survey responses and comments from theologians, the above statements are not reflective of, nor do they substantiate, currently held beliefs and atti- tudes. Following are the questions that were asked of the Survey participants and the response data. Additionally, I have included some (but certainly not all) statements made by leading Ufologists which are representative of their positions. J uestion 1, \"Official confirmation of the discovery of an advanced, technologically superior extraterres- civilization would have severe negative effects on the country's moral, social and religious foundations,\" was designed to introduce the basic concept to be sur- veyed. An overwhelming 77% of the respondents, rep- resenting the three major religions in this country, re- jected this hypothesis. These findings are contrary to the UFO literature which states otherwise. In Messengers of Deception (1979) Jacques Vallee writes: \"[UFOs] are real...Their methods are those of de- ception: systemic manipulation of witnesses and con- tactees; covert use of various sects and cults; control of the channels through which the alleged 'space mes- sages' can make an impact on the public.\" Raymond W. Boeche, in his talk, \"Public Reaction to Alien Contact: A Study,\" given at the MUFON 1988 International Symposium, agreed there would be a \"cri- sis\": \"Along with this initial societal destabilization would come the political consequences. A widespread au- thority crisis could develop, with sharp criticism leveled at political, scientific, and religious leaders. The alien culture would, in the minds of many, usurp or over- shadow the figures of absolute authority [Presidents, Popes, Premiers] which society has come to rely on to establish the 'rules of the game.' Removal of these clear-cut standards of authority could then lead to the next stage, societal anomy [instability or lawlessness].\" Whereas, Question 1 dealt with the country's moral, social and religious environments, Question 2, \"My congregation would perceive any contact made with a technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization, direct or indirect, as a threat,\" subtly addresses the im- plied threat of an \"advanced technology\" and \"hostile in- tentions.\" Excepting what is meant by \"threat,\" re- spondents elected to dismiss the consideration alto- gether: 67% of the total respondents chose \"Strongly Disagree\" or \"Disagree\"; secondarily, a total of 16% chose \"Neither Agree Nor Disagree,\" while only a total of 2% chose \"Strongly Agree\" and a total of 13% chose \"Agree.\" The UFO community typically assumes — without research evidence — that extrater- restrial contact would result in all sorts of social upheaval: political, religious and eco- nomic. Today's pastors and priests aren't quite so paranoid. Speaking at the MUFON 1988 International Symposium, Barry H. Downing, Ph.D. addressed con- cerns about the government's position vis a vis UFOs and religion in \"LIFO's: Four Questions for Theological Seminaries\": \"Future evidence may indicate that from the begin- ning the U.S. Government was very worried about the theological implications of UFOs, and the psychological impact that 'UFO theology' might have on our culture. I would say this concern is well justified. \"It seems likely that the Soviet Union is well aware of the existence of UFOs, and that the possibility of an emerging UFO theology was considered by both sides of the cold war. \"Release of UFO information would have unpre- dictable religious and cultural responses in both America and Russia.\" I t is generally considered UFO \"doctrine\" that (a part of) the alien agenda involves the removal of sperm and eggs from humans for the purpose of cross-breeding. Question 3, \"The discovery of another intelligent civi- lization would cause my congregation to question their fundamental concepts regarding the origin of life,\" ad- dresses the issue of the unique status of humans in the universe. Since some religious organizations maintain Man at the pinnacle of development, the existence of an- other advanced civilization could challenge that concept. The question impacts on the meaning of the doctrine that God made Man in His own image. Once again, a ma- jority opinion was found to be held by the three groups: 82% of the total respondents chose \"Strongly Disagree\" or \"Disagree\"; while a total of 6% chose \"Neither Agree Nor Disagree.\" Evident by the statistics stated herein and confirmed by the comments of respondents, the majority felt the religious faith of their congregation would overcome such proclamations by an unknown, external group. Since the alien beings predominately described by ab- ductees lack human-like organs (and the alleged Roswell Incident autopsies of dead aliens confirm), their ability to successfully mate with humans would appear God- like. In \"Abduction Notes\" (MUFON UFO Journal, June 1994) John Carpenter related a typical abduction scenario he solicited from an abductee under hypnosis: PAGE 4 NUMBER 317 SEPTEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The theologians comments are straightfor- ward and unambiguous in supporting their faith: Man's relationship to God is unique; however, God is the creator of all things. Many respondents, in fact, would be very curious about God's relationship to other beings; was there \"original sin\" and how did God reveal Himself to them? \"She described a classic table exam with the little gray beings removing a fetus and showing it to her. She became very upset when they told her telepathically that it was hers and that she could not keep it.\" Question 4, \"If highly advanced intelligent civiliza- tions exist elsewhere in the universe, the basic tenets of religion would be present,\" queries the respondent on his/her views regarding the relationship between intel- ligence and religion. This question introduces the philo- sophical aspect of religion's place in Man's develop- ment. Would a \"highly advanced intelligent civiliza- tion\" have long since dispensed with religion in favor of science and knowledge? The theologians' comments are straightforward and unambiguous in supporting their faith: Man's relationship to God is unique; however, God is the creator of all things. Many respondents, in fact, would be very curious about God's relationship to other beings; was there \"original sin\" and how did God reveal Himself to them. Since our Judeo-Christian model is based on Adam and Eve's fall from God's grace, God's relationship to other beings would be different in all its dimensions. This question garnered a strong re- sponse: 70% of the total respondents to the survey chose \"Strongly Agree\" or \"Agree,\" while only a total of 2% chose \"Strongly Disagree\" and 3% chose \"Disagree.\" Viewed as an indicator, one would infer these responses are not those of individuals whose belief structure could be easily shaken. While these findings indicate theologians believe in a universal religious principle, the aliens themselves have been reported to express quite an opposing view. In Dr. Thomas Bullard's seminal work, Comparative Analysis of UFO Abduction Reports (1987), in the section \"Attitude Toward Religion,\" abductees relate accounts of comments made by alien beings on the subject of reli- gion. Based on his data, Dr. Bullard concludes: \"What we find is that the beings neither tolerate nor respect the faith of their captives.\" Dr. Bullard relates several ab- ductees' stories: \"...they confiscated his cross and admonished him that it was not right to worship (194a). Others gave crit- ical responses to questions about religion, asserting \"God is only one\" (157), or that there is no correct reli- gion on earth (196e), or explaining that they believed in no gods (245). More overbearing beings mocked God and boasted they were godlike and eternal themselves (133) or claimed that the witness was insignificant and a thousand years was but a day to them (210). Dr. Bullard summarizes by stating: \"The abductors are not Christians; that conclusion at least seems clear from the meager data available.\" Question 5, \"Genetic similarities between mankind and an advanced extraterrestrial civilization would chal- lenge the basic religious concepts of man's relative po- sition in the universe,\" is a variant of Question 3 and 10 and is meant to clarify a persistent UFO Community be- lief which states that accounts of alien interest in humans is grounded in our genetic similarities. Is Man's place in God's universe unique or is God's image manifold throughout the universe? Would knowledge of other in- telligent beings with similar genetic makeup confirm an evolutionary process rather than a divine one? The the- ologians surveyed responded with a total percentage of 77% for \"Strongly Disagree\" or \"Disagree.\" Only 2% chose \"Strongly Agree,\" while a relatively low 14% chose \"Neither Agree nor Disagree.\" Regarding alien \"assistance\" in human evolution, Ufology's position has been adequately summarized by Dr. Downing. From \"UFOs & Religion: The French Connection\" (MUFON UFO Journal, June, 1988): \"My interpretation of the Kathie Davis story [from Intruders by Budd Hopkins] is that UFO beings are in charge —and have been in charge—in control [Jacques] Vallee would say—of the genetic development of life on earth. The UFO message to Kathie and all of us is that UFO beings have helped develop the many human life form variations that we have on earth. They made us what we are today—genetically, psychologically, and spiritually.\" T he abduction phenomenon lodestone is currently understood as being a genetic engineering project, with alien-human hybrid babies the results of such en- deavors. How this is accomplished is a source of endless wonder. Where does the alien sperm used to impregnate human females come from? How does a species so dif- ferent from us, i.e., one without respiratory, digestive or reproductive systems (see Secret Life by David Jacobs, among others) produce sperm compatible to human bi- ology? It is fascinating and ironic to me that mankind— a phallic-worshiping race—should be in the throes of an unwanted alliance with a technologically superior race (they got here, we can't get there) without genitalia! Of course, there are some critics who maintain that ab- duction reports are often researcher-driven. In that case I can only speculate what \"no-penis\" aliens implies. SEPTEMBER 1994 NUMBER 317 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Question 6, \"If an advanced extraterrestrial civiliza- tion had religious beliefs fundamentally different from ours, it would endanger organized religions in this coun- try,\" is a variation of Question 4. Essentially, would people abandon their religion for another based on the source being (at least technologically) far more ad- vanced? Some writers think this is a strong possibility. Whitley Strieber, in his Foreword to Jacques Vallee's Dimensions, A Casebook of Alien Contact (1988) writes: \"The only thing now needed to make the UFO myth a new religion of remarkable scope and force is a single undeniable sighting.\" Esteemed UFO researcher Jacques Vallee, in Dimensions, considers UFOs \"the next form of reli- gion, with a new spiritual movement.\" Dr. Barry Downing concurs. From \"The Rock of Ages Principle\" (MUFON UFO Journal, May, 1990): \"Christian fundamentalists already claim that UFOs are in league with the devil. If the government came forth and identified 'the enemy' much of the UFO and religious communities would undoubtedly flock to their viewpoint.\" Q uestion 6 also addresses the consideration that an extraterrestrial civilization would bring their reli- gion here and there would be mass conversions, de- stroying our own religious beliefs. Once again, the vari- ation of the question did not elicit different conclusions: a total of 70% of the respondents chose \"Strongly Disagree\" or \"Disagree;\" again only 2% chose \"Strongly Agree\" and 11% chose \"Agree.\" While the proven anthropological thesis is that the su- perior culture always subsumes the inferior culture, we cannot ignore that the \"inferior culture\" always manages to retain some form of their own religion. A conquering culture always incorporates some of the beliefs, gods and rituals of the vanquished people. Consider that voodoo has survived in Haiti despite a long history of violent persecution by the Catholic Church. There's an oft-re- peated adage regarding Haiti and their religion: Haitians are 90% Catholic but 100% voodoo. In June, 1994, the provisional president of Haiti, Emile Jonassaint, ended a speech by invoking the voodoo god Agawou to fight a rumored (as of August, 1994) U.S. invasion. From a his- torical perspective, in such an event—aliens bringing their religion here—precedent would strongly indicate a merging of religions rather than a wholesale destruction of one religion by another. Absent from Ufology's theoretical models of the con- tact with extraterrestrials in the fact that three of our ma- jor religions, Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, were transformational movements that radically affected the world. Jesus Christ (AD 30) was a revolutionary—he changed the Hebrew concept of a vengeful, jealous God into a loving, forgiving God the Father; Buddha's (c.560 to c.480 BC) teachings remade the religions of Asia and the Prophet Mohammed (AD 570 to 632 AD) in- troduced monotheism to the nomadic tribes of the Middle East. Is the next great transformational wave breaking? Arguably, if an extraterrestrial race brought their re- ligion here—regardless of its message—I hope we would be as tolerant of it as we are of other religions, at least in principle. If people would prefer to join an alien religion, surely we would be able to grant it the same tolerance we, as a nation, give to the Church of Satan, Santeria or Christian serpent-handling sects. These religious groups are not a threat to mainstream re- ligions and. according to the Survey results, an alien re- ligion wouldn't be either. Q uestion 7, \"Scientific confirmation of contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization is probable in our lifetime,\" received the total highest percentage of 39% for the response \"Neither Agree Nor Disagree.\" While the total response for \"Strongly Disagree\" and \"Disagree\" was high at 47%, there is a consistent trend in the Survey responses which shows an interest in the theological challenges such contact would provide with- out fear their faith would be at risk. Question 8. \"It is unlikely that direct contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization has occurred or is currently ongoing,\" was designed to elicit information about the respondents knowledge of reported UFO con- tacts and alien abductions. The answers strongly reflect that, regardless of claims of widespread UFO sightings and an unrelenting onslaught of alien abductions of hu- mans, theologians have not been exposed to this infor- mation in a manner that would indicate a responsiveness to even consider the proposal. A total of 59% of the re- spondents chose \"Strongly Agree\" or \"Agree.\" In hopes of better UFO Community relations with religious bod- ies, we note that a combined 12% of the respondents chose \"Strongly Disagree\" or \"Disagree\" and a total of 29% had no definitive opinion on this question, choos- ing \"Neither Agree nor Disagree.\" Question 9. \"My congregation would question their beliefs if an advanced extraterrestrial civilization had no system of religion,\" once again reaffirms the main theme of the Survey. Is religion an antiquated concept, barely surviving in our scientifically-oriented, for- ward-thinking society? Would contact with an \"advanced extraterrestrial civilization\" without a reli- gion be God's death knell? From the responses we can reasonably infer that it is assumed that faith in current beliefs would remain firmly established. No respon- dent chose \"Strongly Agree\" as an answer. However, this opinion appears to be a little-known theological conceit, if we review some (heaven knows there are many more) published reports. Researcher Karl Pflock kindly sent me the 1961 Brookings Institution report for NASA titled Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs. The following section of the report PAGE 6 NUMBER 317 SEPTEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL addresses the consequences of a discovery of extrater- restrial life. \"The discovery would certainly be front-page news everywhere; the degrees of political or social repercus- sion would probably depend on leadership's interpreta- tion of (1) it own role, (2) threats to that role, and (3) na- tional and personal opportunities to take advantage of the disruption or reinforcement of the attitudes and val- ues of others. \"How might such information, under what circum- stances, be presented to or withheld from the public for what ends? What might be the role of the discovering scientists and other decision makers regarding release of the fact of discovery! \"It has been speculated that, of all groups, scientists and engineers might be the most devastated by the dis- covery of relatively superior creatures, since these pro- fessions are most clearly associated with the mastery of nature, rather than with the understanding and expres- sion of man. \"The positions of the major American religious de- nominations, the Christian sects, and the eastern reli- gions on the matter of extraterrestrial life need elucida- tion. Consider the following: The Fundamentalist (and antiscience) sects are growing apace around the world and, as missionary enterprises, may have schools and a good deal of literature attached to them. \"For them, the discovery of other life—rather than any other space product—would be electrifying. Since the main ones among these sects are broadly interna- tional in their scope and are, in some places, a news source, the principal distributors of mass media materi- als, an important source of value interpretation, a central social institution, an educational institution, and so on, some scattered studies need to be made both in their home centers and churches and their missions, in relation to attitudes about space activities and extraterrestrial life. Additionally, because of the international effects of space activities and, in the event of its happening, of the discovery of extraterrestrial life, even though space ac- tivities are not internationalized, it is very important to take account of other major religions. \"If superintelligence is discovered, the results be- come quite unpredictable.\" Q uestion 10, \"If an advanced extraterrestrial civi- lization proclaimed responsibility for producing human life, it would cause a religious crisis,\" addresses one of Ufology's widely discussed theories. The theory suggests that alien beings had something to do with our evolutionary process, or in its more developed form, actually came to Earth and seeded us. This theory pos- tulates that aliens can manipulate life and in effect, de- sign life for their own intentions and needs. Since the creation of life is considered by religion to be solely God's province, this question lies at the root of UFO ab- ductee's experiences. With abductees and UFO re- searchers claiming \"they made us\" the link between God and Man has an interloper. Again, a significant agreement among the three religious groups emerged, with a 54% total choosing \"Strongly Disagree\" or \"Disagree.\" Many prominent Ufologists will criticize this notion as belonging to \"fringe Ufology\" (not my term!) and not worthy of consideration. However, no one can deny its prevalence and endurance in the UFO field. John Lear (MUFON's State Director for Nevada, 1988-1989, and host of the MUFON 1989 Symposium) created a firestorm in December 1987—one which continues to rage, spread and transform itself within Ufology. Lear's controversial statement to the press included the fol- lowing: \"The crucifixion of Christ on the Mount of Olives has allegedly been put on film to show the public. The EBE's claim to have created Christ, which, in view of the 'Grand Deception,' could be an effort to disrupt traditional values for undetermined reasons.\" W hile \"serious researchers\" would like to dismiss Lear. Lazar, et al, we cannot ignore the interest of the media and UFO audiences in these individuals and their claims. Lear's statements are not isolated. The 1991 book. Healing Shattered Reality by Alice Bryant and Linda Seebach, contains this statement by Eunethia, Commander of the Starship Venusia, Member of the Ashtar Command, to researcher Yvonne Cole about the aliens who are abducting humans: \"They are of the same group as the Orions, in that they work in an unholy alliance for the purpose of conquest and slave breeding colonies.\" Question 11, \"I believe my answers to the preceding questions represent the views of my congregation,\" summarizes the Survey with regards to whose views are being represented. This answer garnered the second highest total percentage of 69% (highest total response was Question 4, at 70%). Several theologians gave two sets of answers, noting which were personal views and which views they felt were those of the congregation. The total high percentages for the three questions spec- ifying addressing congregational viewpoints (Questions 2, 3 and 9) attest that respondents' consider themselves arbitrators of their communities' social perspective. Unfortunately, the overall positive approach of most of the theologians surveyed on the subject of UFOs and religion is not one recognized by MUFON's own Consultant on Theology. At the MUFON 1990 International UFO Symposium, Dr. Barry Downing (\"ET Contact: The Religious Dimension\") had this to say: \"I think that kind of psychology has guided our gov- ernment UFO policy.

RADAR SIGHTINGS Sightings of sparkling lights & a series of radar returns strike the Holland, Michigan area. By Shirley Coyne M ichigan, like most states, has its share of UFO sightings during any given year. The first 66 days of the new year were extremely quiet, with only two or three sightings being reported. That changed on March 8, 1994, at 9:30 in the evening, when the airspace over Holland, Michigan was invaded by unidentified flying objects. At 2130 hours, the Ottawa County Central Dispatch received a telephone call from Mrs. Holly Graves of Holland, MI. She asked the dispatcher if they knew anything about the lights she and her family were watch- ing. The dispatcher told her that they did not know any- thing about them. She said, \"They look like a string of Christmas lights up in the sky. It's a circle of a lot of dif- ferent lights, and I think somebody should check it out.\" She told the dispatcher that the red, white, and blue lights were \"drifting slowly to the east-southeast.\" The dispatcher asked for her address and said they would send an officer to check it out. The second call to Ottawa 911, was from Troy Prince, a young man who lives two blocks from the Graves. Troy told the dispatcher, \"We are seeing four lights go- ing back and forth. It's a circle of lights and they split apart leaving three, split apart leaving just two. Then they are like in a \"V,\" you know...\" The dispatcher told Troy that an officer had already been dispatched to his area, Country Club Lane and 16th Street. At 2133 hours, Officer Jeff Velthouse had been dis- patched to investigate the lights on Country Club Lane. He was enroute to the Graves home when he got the sec- ond call from the dispatcher. He was already traveling on 16th Street, where Troy Prince lives in an apartment complex, and decided that he might as well respond to that address first. As he approached the apartment complex, he was told by the 911 dispatcher that they had received nu- merous calls about the strange lights. If he would go to the Graves residence, he could see the \"objects\" from the Graves front yard. He radioed his back-up, Sgt. DeJonge. and handed off the Troy Prince call. It was 2143 hours, when Officer Velthouse responded to the Graves home and noticed Darrell Graves standing in the front yard with binoculars. Mr. Graves told the of- ficer that he had been alerted by his children, who had seen a strange object hovering above the house across the road. He then pointed to an object that was southwest of them and approximately 25° up from the horizon. Mr. Graves told him that the object, along with four or five similar objects, had formed a circle and then separated. He handed the binoculars to Officer Velthouse so he could look at the objects, which were a couple of miles away. While using the binoculars, the officer was able to see a second object. He said the objects were separated by quite a distance but did not know how far apart they were. There were red, green, and white lights on the ob- jects, but he was unable to determine any type of shape. He said the lights appeared to be different than any air- craft lights he had ever seen. \"The lights on the objects appeared to be oscillating, rather than blinking,\" he said. They were still moving in a southwesterly direction so he decided to follow them. He got into the patrol car and headed southwest. \"I wanted to watch them to see if I could tell what they really were,\" he said. He radioed 911 and was told they had received a great number of calls from concerned citizens. The dis- patcher asked Velthouse to give the present direction in which the objects were traveling. Velthouse replied, \"Still traveling southwest.\" A fter talking with Velthouse, the 911 dispatcher con- tinued to receive calls from excited residents in Ottawa and Allegan Counties, so he decided to call the National Weather Service which is housed at Muskegon County Airport. 60 miles to the north of Holland. When the weather person answered the telephone, the dis- patcher asked if they had access to radar, and was an- swered in the affirmative. 911 dispatcher: \"Are you getting anything unusual in the southern portion of Ottawa or northern Allegan Counties?\" Radar operator: \"Nothing more than the usual.\" 911 dispatcher: \"We're getting reports of strange ob- jects that are jumping about and traveling to the south- west. We have 60 calls already.\" Radar operator: \"I'm looking in the vertical, getting a large return down there. It's about 6,000...oops! it just disappeared...uh...yeah, there it is about 6,000 feet...now it's moving south.\" 911 dispatcher: \"That's really strange.\" Radar operator: \"It's moving...looks like it's about 80 kilometers from me, down near South Haven...now moving toward the west-southwest. It looks like a big blob.\" 911-dispatcher: \"That's the way it was explained to us.

It's something pretty solid.\" As the radar operator watched the objects on the scope, Officer Velthouse was in his patrol car driving southwest, and watching three objects that were moving in the same direction. He was unable to get closer than two miles from them, therefore, he could not see a shape or size. He got on the radio and put in a request for the dis- patcher to call the National Weather Service and ask if they had any \"blips\" on their radar. The dispatcher told him that contact had already been made, and the radar operator was tracking three objects over the same areas where eyewitnesses were watching them from the ground. As Velthouse continued following the objects, the 911 dispatcher was still talking on the telephone, getting a blow-by-blow account from the radar operator. Radar operator: \"There's one over South Haven, one by the lake shore near Benton Harbor, one near Decatur...wait...there's one down by Berrien County. Wait a minute...South Haven just moved northwest by about...one 20 miles west, over the lake. There's one down by Coloma and one just off the coast of Benton Harbor. They're 7 to 12,000 feet...\" 911 dispatcher: \"This is really strange...weird.\" Radar operator: \"I'm getting four...these are big, big- ger than planes. Three moving toward Chicago, three in a triangle and one way down on the southern coast of Lake Michigan.\" O fficer Velthouse suddenly lost sight of the objects, as he drove southwest. He drove over to Tulip City Airport, parked the patrol car, and attempted to relocate them. For several minutes he waited, scanning the night sky visually. There was nothing unusual in the sky, not even a plane taking off or landing at the small airport. He did not see any personnel because the airport, being small and without radar, closes at 9:00 in the evening. About 2250 hours, Velthouse called 911 and was patched in to the National Weather Service. He wanted to ask the radar operator what he had seen on the radar screen. The radar operator called 911 and asked if Officer Velthouse was who he said he was. The dispatcher told the radar operator that the officer was the person who had watched the objects from the ground and followed them. The radar operator then said that he would talk with Velthouse. Radar operator: \"What is really going on down there?\" Officer: \"We don't know. People are calling in and telling us about these strange objects...\" Radar operator: \"What did it look like?\" Officer: \"Witnesses are seeing five or six objects, some cylindrically-shaped, circles with blue, red, white, and green lights. We've had reports from south Holland \"It's a pretty strong return I'm getting.. .Oh my God, what is that? Now I'm getting three of them separated by about 5,000 feet in height and maybe 50 kilometers apart. They are very strong returns. It's something pretty solid.\" and over in northern Allegan County. Lots of lights moving all over the place.\" Radar operator: \"There were three and sometimes four blips, and they weren't planes. Planes show as pin points on the scope, these were the size of half a thumb nail. They were from 5 to 12,000 feet at times, moving all over the place. Three were moving toward Chicago. I never saw anything like it before, not even when I'm doing severe weather.\" Officer Velthouse asked the radar operator if he could determine how fast the objects were traveling. He told the officer that one moved 20 miles off shore in 10 sec- onds. Radar operator: \"Wish we had pictures of what I could see. Actually there are blips showing up on the screen and being recorded on the computer part of it, so we can see that.\" He then informed the officer that the tower at Muskegon County Airport had also observed the objects on radar, as did the tower at Grand Rapids International Airport. At 10:36 p.m., I was in my office grading some Field Investigator exams when the telephone rang. Robert Gribble, Western Region Director for MUFON, and founder of the UFO Reporting Center based in Seattle, WA, was calling to give me information about a radar observation/UFO sighting. When we finished the con- versation and said goodby, I began making telephone calls. I called the Ottawa County Central Dispatch, control towers at Muskegon County Airport and Grand Rapids, the National Weather Service, and Val Rose, Michigan MUFON weather person. Dispatch deputy director, Rebecca Schatney, told me that it was the department's practice to call the weather service for information about why an officer was ob- serving something unusual. She said the officer and the dispatchers had completed their 3 to 11:00 p.m. shift, but if I would call back the next day I would be able to speak with them. The radar operator stated that he had tracked three and sometimes four objects which were jumping all over the place, were very strong returns, and very solid. The object that had hovered over South Haven moved 20 miles off shore in 10 seconds. He was still very ex- cited over what he had observed and repeated the details three times. He also said it was their practice to contact SEPTEMBER 1994 NUMBER 317 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL the UFO Reporting Center when something was ob- served. The control tower personnel stated they did not see anything on their radar. They did admit watching from a window as the lights moved in a triangle formation. When Officer Velthouse spoke with the radar opera- tor at 2250 hours, he was given the same information about the object's movement to the center of Lake Michigan, and the time it took to get there. He also told the officer that he had spoken to me earlier (at 10:40 p.m.), and he gave him my name and telephone number. That portion of their conversation was not in- cluded on our copy of the Ottawa County 911 tape. Also missing was confirmation that the object moved from South Haven to 20 miles off shore in 10 seconds. When Officer Velthouse wrote his report at the conclu- sion of his shift, he included the conversation that he had with the radar operator. T o the southeast of Decatur, approximately 10 miles distance, is the small town of Marcellus. A young woman who lives there took several minutes of video footage while standing on her back deck. She saw two objects at 9:30 p.m., and watched as they \"jumped\" around in the night sky. As the radar operator watched the screen, he could see a \"blip\" over Decatur. The woman was video taping what he was seeing. Officer Velthouse said the lights were moving south- west toward Lake Michigan. Each object had one light that was green, another that was red, green and white. They would stand still over Holland, then move south- west. When the objects were flying in a triangle forma- tion, one would move out of formation, then move back in. At the same time, the National Weather Service op- erator picked up radar blips that were moving in the same manner. Simultaneously, tower personnel at Muskegon County Airport saw what they took to be aircraft flying in formation some 60 miles south, near South Haven. Reports began to \"trickle\" in and eyewitnesses were located. On Friday, March 11, 1994, we were knee- deep in sighting reports. Our telephones were ringing non-stop, day and night. We tried to make assessments of what we had and what we were dealing with. State Section Directors Donald Ashley for Ottawa County and Virginia Tilly for Kent County began to coordinate the field investigators. We launched a full investiga- tion by undertaking the slow process of interviewing the witnesses. Actually the sightings began on March 7, 1994, at 10:30 in the evening, when Scott Ruiter was driving south on 168th Street, near M31 in Grand Haven. He no- ticed a string of four lights moving from west-northwest to east-southeast. The lights, which were moving slowly, would blink in sequence from right to left, then repeat the pattern. He stopped his car and watched them for a while. The object appeared to be at an elevation of 2,000 feet or less, and was one half mile away, over a tree line. He watched the lights until they moved out of his range of vision. There were three other witnesses to this event and the investigator is trying to locate them. Joey Graves, age 14, was the first member of the family to see the object on March 8, 1994, at 9:30 p.m. He and sister Michelle, age 10, were in the living room watching TV. Their parents, Holly and Darrell Graves, were in their bedroom watching TV. Joey was lying on the sofa as he watched TV. When he changed his position, by rolling over, his attention was drawn to a circle of lights which were above the road about tree-top level. To him, it looked larger than the length of three cars put together. \"It had white lights and every once in a while they changed over to red. It was too big to be a balloon.\" As the object was \"drifting slowly\" toward the farmhouse across the road, Joey be- gan to yell, \"Look at this...look at this!\" Michelle looked out the front window and saw the object hovering above the farmer's house. \"It had all kinds of lights going in a circle around it. It was pretty big, maybe as big as the house it was sitting over,\" she said. The children fled the living room to alert their parents. They were both yelling \"look at this,\" as they ran toward the bedroom. The whole family returned to the living room win- dow. Everyone was shocked at what they saw. Holly Graves said, \"It was the weirdest thing I saw in my life.\" She said it was just sitting there above the house. \"It was a big circle. It had lights, but they weren't blink- ing, not then. It was circular and turning and not blink- ing,\" she said. She was curious and excited, but had no idea what she was looking at. It just seemed really \"weird\" to her. When the lights began to blink, it re- minded her of Christmas lights when they are blinking, \"like they are chasing each other.\" She said, \"What we saw was not the whole craft, but the bottom of it, turning in a clockwise motion.\" Darrell Graves thought he was looking at helium balloons. He figured some kids had put lights in bal- loons, for a prank. Suddenly he realized this was some- thing unlike anything he had ever seen. He also de- scribed the object as being circular with inset lights. \"The body of the object was oscillating in a clockwise motion but there was no sound,\" he said. They watched for 10 minutes before the object began to rise and drift away very slowly. The family watched four to five similar objects as they moved together to form a circle, would separate, move about, and come back together. When an object left the formation, it would dart away, then return. Officer Velthouse arrived at 9:43 p.m., and Darrell spoke with him. After he left, the family went to bed. Troy Prince, his brother, and another man all share an apartment on 16th Street. When they noticed the lights they stepped onto their second story balcony so they PAGE. 10 NUMBER 317 SEPTEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL could get a better view. They could see four lights that were in a circle-shaped formation. The lights were blink- ing in sequence. They would separate and come back to- gether in what looked to them like a big \"V\"-shape. The objects would separate one at a time. \"First there were four, then three, then two,\" Troy said. The men watched until a line of trees obscured their vision. They felt certain the objects had gone down in a corn field. (Note: A team of MUFON investigators walked the corn stubble field but did not find any evidence that indicated a landing.) L ee Lamberts, sports editor for the Holland Sentinel newspaper, saw intense lights flying in a boomerang-shaped formation, about the same time the Graves and Troy Prince were experiencing their sighting. Lambert said, \"The formation of lights stayed perfect. It sounded distinctly like one jet, but there were half a dozen lights on it, and as many as ten.\" The object moved very slowly over Holland High School field house. At 9:30 p.m., the woman who lives in Marcellus looked out the window and saw some very strange lights in the night sky. She picked up her video camera and went out on the deck. She took several minutes of footage as two objects darted about. Marcellus is less than 40 miles from South Haven and 10 miles from Decatur. Perhaps the woman filmed the object at Decatur and the one that suddenly showed up in Berrien County, which is southwest of her. To the north of Holland, in Newaygo County, a man was standing outdoors at 9:30 p.m., looking at the stars. He was looking west when suddenly an extremely bright object \"dropped\" straight down. He thought it was prob- ably a falling star \"without a tail,\" until the second object dropped in the same manner in the same spot. At the same time, his sister, who lives in Ferrysburg, was watching a bright object that was hovering over Lake Michigan. She turned from the window momen- tarily and when she turned back, the object was gone. Ferrysburg is 15 miles south of Muskegon, 30 miles north of Holland. Two employees at the power plant in South Haven watched lights that were hovering nearby. Suddenly the lights shot out across Lake Michigan. Were they looking at the same object the radar operator was seeing on the scope? State section director for Van Buren County, Elmer Bean, and other investigators are following up on this sighting. There are other witnesses involved and they are trying to locate them. Michigan MUFON is in the midst of a major, radar- confirmed UFO \"flap,\" with more than 300 witnesses to interview. What the eyewitnesses were seeing coincides with what the radar operator was looking at on his scope. In Newaygo County, a man standing out- doors at 9:30 p.m., looking at stars, saw an extremely bright object suddenly drop straight down. He thought it was a falling star \"without a tail,\" until a second object dropped in the same manner in the same spot. Everyone is interested in what happened in Holland, Michigan on that cold starry night of March 8, 1994. The last reported sighting from Holland occurred one hour ago, at 10:30 p.m., March 11, 1994. The sightings were not isolated incidents on the west side of the state. On March 8, 1994, at 9:30 p.m., sight- ings were occurring all over the State of Michigan. There are 82 counties in the state; sightings were re- ported in 42 of the counties, from the Upper Peninsula, down to the Ohio and Indiana borders. The more inter- esting cases occurred from March 10, 1994 to the pre- sent. Part two of this article will contain detailed de- scriptions of some of the cases that occurred in Ottawa, Kent, Van Buren, Kalamazoo and Genesee Counties. There are ten video tapes that are in the process of, or waiting to be analyzed, and more than a dozen pho- tographs. Two of our MUFON investigators were for- tunate in that they had sightings in different counties on different nights. I have filed Freedom of Information Act requests with the National Weather Service to obtain the \"com- puter part\" print-out of what was being seen on the radar screen. I was told that the SR-70 radar that was be- ing used that night did not have computer \"hook-up\" ca- pability. I suspect that isn't true, however, because the radar operator made the statement to Officer Velthouse that \"actually, there are blips showing up on the screen and being recorded on the computer part of it, so we can see that.\" Requests have also been filed with the FAA in regard to the radar observations by control tower personnel at Muskegon County Airport, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, O'Hare, and near Kimbell, Minnesota. We have the written report that Officer Jeff Velthouse filed, admission from the radar operator, and a copy of the Ottawa County 911 tape, which was obtained through an FOIA request by Michael Walsh, a reporter for the Muskegon Chronicle newspaper in Muskegon. A case of this magnitude could take a year or more to complete. Look for Part Two in a subsequent issue of the Journal.

A rash of in- teresting sighting reports have recently surfaced through- out the eastern and central portions of West Virginia as if to remind us that close encounters are anything but or- dinary. During September and October of 1993, residents of Stonewood (near Clarksburg) were amazed night af- ter night by various displays of lights that occasionally flew low overhead, giving the impression of a brightly- lit cross with many individual white lights lined in rows along the bottom (the local airport was not aware of any advertising planes in the area). In December a housewife near Martinsburg was shocked when a bright light swooped in from the sky nearly crashing into her bedroom window. She had just come upstairs near midnight and yelled to her sleeping brother and his wife. They came rushing into her room to catch a glimpse of something big rising up from the back yard towards the roof of their house. It was de- scribed as circular, perhaps 50 feet in diameter, with a shiny, metallic, brass-like finish sporting red lights un- derneath. A bright white \"crystalline\" cupola sat on top of the overturned saucer shape. Feeling vulnerable, she asked that the window blinds be drawn to shield them from the gaze of whatever might be watching them and her brother suggested shooting it, an idea quickly vetoed by the others. The object passed over the house and was seen moving above a quarry on the other side of the road from their house. They watched it for a long time as it moved back and forth over the quarry. Eventually it zoomed out of sight in the blink of an eye. The experience was of special significance to the housewife, who had no prior interest or belief in UFO's. She exhibited a strong religious belief and was gen- uinely puzzled that her church had not prepared her for this experience. The object came back a few nights later, caused TV interference, and has not been seen again. Don Morar, MUFON's investigator on this case, was impressed with the sincerity of all of the witnesses, who beg anonymity. Karen Heaster reports to us from Quiet Dell where a women and her two nephews (ages 13 and 15) experi- enced a \"hat-like\" object rising up from behind some nearby trees and passing about 300 feet in front of their car. They described a badly tarnished silver-type surface with bright red lights and a diamond-shaped window in the center. There was no sound but electromagnetic in- terference occurred with the car engine, radio, tape player, and clock radio. This experience converted a few more observer skeptics into \"true believers.\" Gregg Knight, our Assistant State Director, investi- gated a remarkable claim from Morgantown, West Virginia. Jane M. (not her real name) and her boyfriend, John, were out for an evening ride in his truck. Shortly after 10:00 P.M. on Sunday night February 20, 1994, they were driving up a long hill heading south away from downtown Morgantown (Route 119). As they cleared the top of the hill and snaked along the winding ridgetop, Jane pointed out a triangular pattern of lights off to their left flying low over a shallow valley. The sky was clear and despite the cold weather they rolled down a window to get a better view. They suspected a heli- copter was out looking for an escaped fugitive since a spotlight could be seen shining down onto the woods be- low. T here appeared to be three red lights at each end of the triangle with one green light just below one of the red lights. The object emitted no sound and was flying in a straight line about 30 degrees above the hori- zon. Just past the entrance to a Ramada Inn, the object passed directly over their truck from the rear. John slowed down to 15 miles per hour, leaned forward hunching over the steering wheel, looked straight up and was astounded. It was huge (apparent size estimated by imagining a briefcase held at arm's length) and had a metallic surface. Jane was so amazed she stuck her head out of the passenger window and stared up in awe. The surface was a \"whitish grey\" with a brushed alu- minum-type luster. Seams were visible in the amber light reflected from the sodium vapor interstate lights. Red lights could be seen at the four corners of a rectan- gular shape with one green light just toward the inside of the object at one of the corners. There was no sound as it \"floated\" sedately forward and away from them (possibly traveling at a speed of less than 40 mph). They took the entrance ramp onto I- 68 heading toward the southwest while the object pulled ahead of them moving in the same direction. By the time they advanced to the westbound lane of the inter- state, the object had crossed over the interstate, flipped over onto its side, and flew alongside them. Jane had a strange feeling that it was deliberately \"showing off' for their benefit and took note of the time (10:10 P.M.) for future reference. They never saw anything of the craft other than that flat, rectangular bottom. As the UFO gradually slipped away to the south, Jane urged John to take 179 heading south toward PAGE 12 NUMBER 317 SEPTEMBER. 1994"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Jane was astounded, reporting the experi- ence as awesome and amazing. John, on the other hand, found the event to be dis- tressing and frightening. In his judgement it was dangerous to fool around with some- thing so mysterious, unexplainable and close. Clarksburg, a route that would have placed them back underneath the object, but John had a bad feeling about all this. Against Jane's exhortations he drove onto 179 heading north. John pressed desperately upon the ac- celerator pedal and may have approached a speed of 90 miles per hour in a successful effort to get as far away from it as possible. Jane convinced John to take the next exit (number 152, Westover) where she called the Morgantown airport from an Exxon station hoping for some rational expla- nation. A man in the tower talked to her and knew of no air traffic in the vicinity. He contacted the Clarksburg airport (about 35 miles to the south) and she heard Clarksburg also claim no knowledge of any craft flying in the area. It was too low to be picked up on radar. She was surprised at the sympathetic and cooperative re- sponse she got from the airport, as if a UFO is not such a ridiculous thing to report as she might have thought! How many other witnesses may exist to this sighting is unknown. There were no other cars noticed on the road by the witnesses. Gregg wisely invited Jane and John to the first West Virginia State MUFON conference held this past April where they told their story again to the assembled members who were all quite impressed. In May I traveled to Morgantown and interviewed them at the site, taking rough measurements of angles and dis- tances. When first noticed, the object was 4.5 miles south- west of the Morgantown airport and about six hundred feet away from the witnesses. It subtended an angle of two closed fists at arm's length (roughly 25 degrees) yielding a trigonometric length estimate of about 200 feet. The witness description is consistent with a straight line flight path at speeds too slow for ordinary aircraft. John suspected the object was not much higher than a Comfort Inn sign located above them to the left (the road is cut 100 feet deep into the ridge top) which places the sign at about 300 feet above the witnesses. If we assume the object was 400 feet above them at closest approach, it would have subtended an angle of 50 degrees, which is consistent with that of a brief case held at arm's length. The reported speeds and measured distances of the trip suggest a total viewing time of about 4 minutes. Both witnesses give every impression of being sincere and credible. They had not been drinking and ridiculed a suggestion they may have been on drugs. Jane is reli- gious but displays a hard-nosed approach to judging other aspects of reality and has no interest in New Age beliefs. Neither witness expressed any prior interest in UFO's and would not have taken a report such as this one seriously if it had been reported to them by some- body else. This sighting has had a profound impact upon their beliefs. Jane was astounded, reporting the ex- perience as awesome and amazing. She wants to know more about the subject of UFO's. On the other hand, John found the event to be distressing and frightening. In his judgement it was dangerous to fool around with something so mysterious, unexplainable and close. These encounters and more like them are being com- piled by Bob Teets (who has spent the last year studying UFO's for the Human Potential Foundation) into a book on West Virginia sightings to be published shortly by Headline Books Inc. Dr. Spickler Is MUFON state director for West Virginia. RELIGIOUS CRISIS — Continued from Page 7 consulted with a few modern theologians, and said to them, 'We know UFOs are real. Should we tell the pub- lic, or keep it quiet,' I am sure the majority of clergy would say, 'Keep it quiet.' \"Suffice it to say that there is much at stake for Western religion in the UFO experience. If our gov- ernment revealed the truth about UFOs, I am not sure what might be the social and religious-spiritual conse- quences for our society.\" Clearly, it is time to rethink our attitudes regarding re- ligion and UFOs. I hope other researchers will follow my lead and develop dialogues with their religious com- munities. To ignore religion is harmful to our objec- tives. It is only through \"playing the numbers game\" (inviting the religious communities to join us) that we will achieve our purpose of full disclosure. We have a vast, untapped, unified source of power and influence— the religious communities—that we should actively pur- sue. Perhaps when we have numbers that count, our government will begin to take us seriously.

Haines I t is probably true to say that almost all MUFON members want to make a positive difference in solv- ing the so-called UFO mystery. You sincerely desire to work individually and together to uncover new facts which may finally explain what is going on. And you may also have already heard about the importance of getting involved somehow. For instance, you may have studied the MUFON field investigator's manual and are now certified as a field investigator. Now you sit and wait for \"that case\" to occur near enough to you to go out and \"study\" it. But the case has not yet occurred and you are getting a little impatient. What else can you do? I had the opportunity to speak at the MUFON 1994 International UFO Symposium meeting in Austin, Texas. Once again I was personally impressed with the patient.endurance and seeming deep interest of so many people in the audience about so many different aspects of the UFO phenomena. I was struck by the apparent high level of motivation (and, perhaps, curiosity) of those present. And so I took the opportunity to share an idea with the audience. I want to repeat it here (with some editorial corrections and additions) for your con- sideration, in case you were not able to attend the meet- ing. Since my remarks were videotape recorded I hesi- tate to quote myself from memory, nevertheless, this is the jist of my brief remarks in Austin. \"I am impressed with the fact that you (the audi- ence ) have sat here for upwards of twelve hours a day, late into the evening, to hear the speakers. I know of very few scientific audiences who would do the same. And I interpret your behavior as one sign of your serious commitment to this important subject. So, I would like to challenge each of you to put your patience and cre- ativity to use for the good of ufology. Here is an idea for you to think about. Select some subject which is of in- terest to you and then read all you can about it, then share your findings with others. You can make a contri- bution. You may even be a speaker at next year's MU- FON meeting.\" I was finished. But upon returning home from Austin I began to think about what else I could do to help you actually move out on your own to accomplish this challenge. Here, then, are some topics that continue to be of inter- est to me and which you also might want to research. Of course you may think up many others as well.

(MUFON 1977 UFO Symposium Proceedings) Carefully plan and conduct a crop circle hoax of great precision and scale but also obtain equally careful video, photographic, and other records of the process for later analysis. H ere are a few general ideas on how to accomplish one of these challenges. First, don't let anyone tell you you aren't qualified. You probably are! Second, don't expect to solve all of the world's problems by yourself, i.e., be realistic about what you can do; let others accomplish what they can. Third, spend a little time each week on the project rather than making it a 24 hour a day job. This will allow your mind to stay re- freshed and to permit insights and wisdom to emerge from your endeavors. Fourth, ask a lot of questions in li- braries, using computer bulletin boards, during face to face meetings with officials, etc. And read everything you can find on the subject. Fifth, keep a written journal record of your project from which a final report can be written later. Sixth, keep a spouse, work associate, pro- fessional colleague, significant other, or someone else in- formed of your progress from time to time. Don't work in a total vacuum. Seventh, share your puzzling ques- tions and frustrations with others soon after they appear. Don't allow them to impede your progress. Finally, try to find enjoyment in what you do. Remember, you may well make an important breakthrough in this wild, weird, and wonderful world we call ufology. © 1994 Richard F. Haines Dr. Haines is a retired NASA perceptual psychologist.

The meetings offer a totally open and safe space for dialogue regarding personal experiences, personal beliefs, and the implications of what such encounters might portend in a larger sense for this planet. Any topic regarding anomalous phenom- ena that a group member feels strongly about and wants to discuss is allowed. I was not surprised, therefore, when a woman asked to speak to me one day about something that was trou- bling her and that she didn't know how to deal with or understand. In all honesty, when I heard her story, I thought there was the possibility that this individual was highly imaginative. But when a second person some time later spoke to me of the same thing, I decided to look into this further. The first woman's story, whom we shall name Vera (pseudonym), went something like this: Vera had driven her car to the post office to get stamps. She walked in and joined the line, taking the end position. Soon thereafter a man walked in and asked the man directly in front of Vera if this was the end of the line. The man ahead of Vera answered that he was indeed the end of the line, wherein Vera spoke up and said that she was the end of the line. No one looked at Vera or acknowledged that she had spoken and, in fact, she was almost stepped on as the second man took up the end position in line. Vera thought to herself how rude these people were and moved slight- ly to the side of the line, so as not to be jostled: she con- tinued moving up with the other people. When her time came to go to the counter to be helped, she walked up and stated her business and. quite to her amazement, the man behind her walked right up and did the same. The postal clerk never acknowledged Vera but began assist- ing the man. Vera announced loudly that she was there first, but no one paid the slightest attention to her. Getting very upset by this time with what she considered extreme rudeness, she just walked out of the post office and went home. A number of days later, she was at- tempting to get some assistance in a store and no one would help her or even acknowledge that she was pre- sent. It seemed as if she was invisible to people around her and also couldn't be heard when she spoke. She had no idea what was happening, but she certainly wasn't pleased about it. When, a second person came to me with a story that seemed to involve invisibility, I began to take this a lit- tle more seriously. In brief, this woman was sitting on the sofa, letting her mind wander as she stared at the wall. The wall seemed to take on a less-than-solid form and she was fascinated with it When she finally came out of her reverie, she was astonished to find her hus- band searching the house for her. Upon seeing her sitting on the sofa, he asked her where she had been hiding. When she said that she had been sitting there all along, he stated that he had been past the sofa a number of times searching for her and she certainly had not been there. Here, again, although she was physically pre- sent, she seemed to be unseen by another person. At this point, I decided to check with a number of other researchers and see if anyone else had ever heard of such a report. I was surprised to find that a number of other researchers had, in just the past year or so, either heard of this or knew someone directly who had expe- rienced something akin to this. I was given several leads in Texas and followed up on them. I spoke with two individuals in different towns who reported invisibility experiences. One woman went through a cafeteria line and when she approached the cashier, the cashier couldn't see her. It was only when the woman began to get upset with being ignored that the cashier suddenly saw her standing there and, ap- pearing to be a little shaken up, rang up her lunch ticket. Another woman who had similar experiences wanted to test this and, after having been ignored at a movie theater ticket window, walked in and out of the theater past the ticket person several times. No one ever indicated that they could see her. Then to be absolutely certain, she entered the lobby of the men's room to see if she could get stares. No one even looked her way. And there are other stories... I don't know what these reports represent, but I am in- terested in gathering information from other researchers and investigators who might be encountering this phe- nomenon. I'm especially interested in seeing if any kind of correlation can be found between those individuals who feel they have been onboard an alien craft and those who are experiencing this invisibility phenomenon. It would be interesting to learn if, in passing through the force field of a craft, the abductee's own vibrational frequency is somehow altered or raised. After all, re- ported craft seem to have the ability to appear and dis- appear at will and might have a force field that alters vi- brational frequency and allows for these phenomena. Although it stretches the imagination to consider that involuntary, spontaneous invisibility could be occur- ring to some abductees, I am putting forth a serious in- quiry to the researchers and investigators who read the Mutual UFO Network UFO Journal, asking for your assistance in acquiring any data and information that might come to your attention in this regard.

However, a large portion of both groups that either accept or reject the existence of other-worldly entities have considerable trouble with the concept that any extraterrestrial beings of superior knowledge and ability could make \"mistakes.\" Skeptics drill this point as \"proof that these ac- counts are manufactured in the imaginative minds of bored individuals because aliens of superior intelligence would \"just not make ridiculous blunders.\" How do any of us know for certain what another form of intelli- gence would do? Do we need to make them into infal- lible gods just because they are apparently more ad- vanced? Perhaps they are different only in their abilities concerning the manipulation of our environment — which seem magical, spiritual, or \"dimensional\" in our eyes. Perhaps they are just another race of beings who managed to comprehend advanced space travel a hun- dred years or so before we did. Perhaps they are just as susceptible to unexpected twists of fate or unknown variables in our world as we are. NASA's space launches would seem incredible and magical to earthly aborigines not previously aware of such human technological ad- vances. Yet most of us are aware of NASA's many im- perfections and unplanned blunders despite its superior technology! ——^-^—^— UFO research into alien abduction ac- counts is littered with unexpected moments of apparent extrater- restrial blunders. (Some researchers feel these \"blunders\" ^^^^—^^^^—^^^^^^^— are deliberate to get our attention, but 1 think they would have many more obvious methods for obtaining our at- tention!) It is not especially amusing to be returned from an abduction to the wrong city 15-30 miles away — which has happened in a few cases. One Arkansas rancher was talking on his truck's cit- izen band radio to his wife back at the house when he spotted a brilliant light coming at htm from the pasture in front of his truck. The signal crackled and was lost. In the dark she and others found the tire tracks of the truck in the dewy grass stop dead without any trace of the truck or driver. Minutes later the CB radio crackled on again with the driver reporting confusion and disorien- tation. They located him and his truck on top of a ridge across the valley—but where no road existed and with Perhaps they are just another race of beings who managed to comprehend advanced space travel a hundred years or so before we did. Perhaps they are just as susceptible to unexpected twists of fate or unknown variables in our world as we are. no tire tracks in the dewy grass of that area leading to the vehicle. It was as if the truck had been neatly set down—but on the wrong ridge! If one is not careful, I suppose, many Arkansas ridges may look alike from the air. One elderly but spirited woman found herself on several occasions outside of her locked home, naked in the yard. Although many others report this upsetting displacement, this woman was more upset over the loss of several expensive nightgowns which never returned with her. In another case a husband kept replacing his wife's nightgowns because he hoped she would not be seen floating naked over the neighborhood. People sometimes find themselves in someone else's clothes. Budd Hopkins tells an amusing tale of a woman and her little boy who sleeps with her every night. The woman had a new Victoria's Secret nightgown on; the boy had his favorite little pajamas. She awoke the next morning in a man's oversized shirt; her boy found him- self in an older boy's pajamas. What man awakened in the Victoria's Secret nightgown? (And what did he tell his wife?) I suppose that aliens with a busy schedule and perhaps dozens of abductees aboard might confuse the proper return of one's clothes from a large assortment. Many people are returned to the wrong beds or bed- rooms. In one case a family of five found themselves all in different bedrooms one morning and were quite amazed because not one of them ever remembered being up during the night. It became more interesting when they found a burned circle in the back yard and neigh- bors asking about the bright lights at which the dogs had been barking wildly. One couple found that they had been switched from ———^^—^— their usual sides of the bed to the oppo- site sides. Their re- spective pillows and blankets had also been switched. Neither could ex- plain how this ^^^~^^^^^~^^^^^^^^^ overnight exchange could have occurred. A number of people have found themselves reversed with their feet on their pillows—of- ten with mud or blades of grass—and their heads at the foot of the beds. One couple had both seen intrusive entities in their bedroom but forget about these moments when offering to let the husband's mother spend the night in their bed- room in order to experience their waterbed. This no-non- sense Christian woman awakened to see the same tall dark being that they had observed previously but had never described to anyone. His mother noted that it seemed puzzled and disturbed in finding her there in- stead of them! Needless to say, she had no desire to sleep in their bedroom again. SEPTEMBER 1994 NUMBER 317 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL And, finally, there is a unique account from one of my cases in Missouri in which a perfectly round, 30-foot deep, 20-foot in diameter hole had been discovered near Jefferson City, Missouri, within walking distance of an abductee's home. Scientists from nearby Rolla, Missouri had even investigated it by report. The key to its formation comes from a session with the nearby abductee. She had been recalling her abduc- tion under hypnosis, remembering being led to the craft by an alien on each side of her. Suddenly, they let go of her and returned quickly to the craft. She bursts out laughing because she sees their ship sinking into the ground. Apparently it had set down on top of a Missouri sinkhole: the weakened earth gave way—the craft sank out of sight. It was therapeutic for her because she knew that they were infallible and not so powerful after all. Besides, they dropped her and left quickly! The unusual hole remained as proof that something large, heavy, and perfectly round had been there overnight. Every researcher has these kinds of amusing accounts which seem to provide a different kind of \"proof that our reality is being intruded by another type of reality that we can barely begin to comprehend. But, perhaps extraterrestrials can make mistakes. NEXT COLUMN: \"Another Look at the False Memory Syndrome\" Letters to Mufon UFO Journal ROSWELL REVISITED I had been going to answer the points in Karl Pflock's letter (August Journal) in reverse order, but then decided there might be those who thought I was ducking the crit- icism that I had said Joyce interviewed Brazel on the ra- dio. Clearly, this is not what I meant to say, nor is it ac- curate. Based on our March, 1989 interview with Joyce (notes because Joyce wouldn't let us record), Joyce said that he called the sheriff to see if there was anything in- teresting happening there. According to Joyce, the sher- iff put Brazel on the phone and Joyce did interview him, all the time spinning the records and doing every- thing else he had to do in the radio station. That evening, Joyce put Brazel's story on the air. How do we know? Joyce told us. Besides, Joyce said that he had feared he would be questioned by the station owner, Walt Whitmore, Sr. about the crazy flying saucer story. He didn't want to get into trouble and lose his job. Had Joyce been referring to the Wednesday report in which he reinterviewed Brazel, he would have had no such concern because Whitmore had already interviewed Brazel himself. Joyce would have had no concern about his job on Wednesday. Therefore, Joyce reported, on the radio, his interview with Brazel on Sunday, July 6.1 was both right and wrong. I should have made it clear it was the story that had been aired and not Brazel himself. We too have interviewed many people who lived in Roswell at the time, and have been told that the rumors were flying thick and fast. I spoke to a number of people who said they had heard stories but thought nothing of them until they read about it in the newspaper. That would suggest that some people were talking about fly- ing saucers in Roswell prior to the publication of the July 8 article. It seems that Pflock does not want to believe that the article was designed to divert attention, and he clings to the idea that the press release was a mistake. If we look at the body of data, we see that in the first article there is no clue as to where to look. Brazel isn't named, nor is there a suggestion as to where the craft was recov- ered—just a ranch in the Roswell region. The Chaves County Sheriff is mentioned but the only name is that of Jesse A. Marcel, who is on his way to Fort Worth with the debris. We know, based on a time line from the AP, that the balloon answer exists by 5:30 P.M. in Fort Worth, or 4:30 P.M. in Roswell. If we accept the testi- mony of J. Bond Johnson as solid, then the balloon an- swer would be available as early as 3 or 3:30 Roswell time. The next day, The Roswell Morning Dispatch mentions that the \"Disk is a Weather Balloon,\" and says that it was found \"90 miles northwest of Roswell.\" There is nothing in the press release to tell the curious where to go in search of the wrecked saucer. Instead, it tells them that it has already been recovered and is on its way to Fort Worth. At least two people, the pseudonymous Steve MacKenzie and Walter Haul, have said that the press re- lease was part of the cover story. We also have the sto- ries from the newspapers that suggest the officers at Roswell received blistering phone calls from Washington about the press release but Haul denies ever receiving any such calls even though he is named in the article as one of those criticized. The cheapest shot in a letter filled with cheap shots is the allegation that we somehow didn't do our job as in- vestigative journalists because we opted to provide all the data. True, I'm not thrilled with the testimony that one [alien] survived the crash, and when the first of the witnesses mentioned it, I said nothing about it. When asked about it, we mentioned that we had heard rumors that one survived but that we had been unable to confirm them. Now there are three, Frankie Rowe, Barbara Dugger and Ruben Anaya, who all suggest one survived. Should we report this data or should we ignore it? Clearly, based on the witnesses, this is second- or third-hand testimony, but it is out there. To not report it leaves us open to questions about what else we know and didn't report. Besides, there are those complaining that we haven't reported more about it, though my response is PAGE 18 NUMBER 317 SEPTEMBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL that everything we knew at the time is reported in the book. A s we did in other sections of the book, we reported all the data, trying to alert readers to its value by pointing out that it is not direct evidence, but testimony by those who heard the stories from others. We be- lieved those reading the book would assign their own priority to the data and make their own decision about how important it was. The question we asked was how could the reader make an intelligent decision without all the data. It was the reason that we included the negative comments made by Dr. W. Curry Holden's wife and daughter about his reliability because of his advanced age. No one would be aware of the circumstances of the interview had we not reported on them. To understand the impor- tance of the data, all of it must be included. Mr. Pflock, in his report Roswell in Perspective, opted not to include all the data. He is writing a persua- sive piece about the Project Mogul balloons. In the course of that, he made editorial decisions about which data to include. He opted to use the interview he con- ducted with Jason Kellahin and reject, out of hand, the data supplied by Robin Adair. In fact, he completely ig- nores that data, mentioning in a footnote that he found the information flawed. The question that I ask is how can the reader make an intelligent assessment of the data without all of it. The fact that Kellahin has altered his story significantly is not mentioned. That he disagrees with Adair is, but the reader is told to ignore it. Yet, when all the facts are brought into play, it becomes clear that Kellahin's story is so badly flawed that it is nearly useless. By reading Pflock's report, the reader doesn't know that, and the conclusions reached by the reader are then as flawed as Pflock's. So, I make no apologies for including the data about the possibility one alien survived. It was not included, as Pflock suggests, to sell books because the book had al- ready been sold to the publisher based on a five-page outline that mentioned nothing of a survivor. The first book continues to sell well without the data that one sur- vived in it. No. the only reason to include it was to pro- vide enough information so the reader can made an in- telligent decision. It is extremely easy to criticize the work of others, es- pecially when the case being discussed is so complex. Pflock has one opinion about it, based on his investiga- tion into it. We have another, based on our five-year in- vestigation and more than two thousand interviews con- ducted with more than five hundred people. There will be mistakes that emerge as we continue to research and study. Little things that were insignificant will take on huge importance as the skeptics and detractors believe they find the fatal flaw in our work. We become so busy stepping on the ants that we miss the elephants that are about to run over us. There is not a word on the Roswell case, regardless of the length or author, that I can't pick apart by seizing on the trivia. Names are misspelled, timing is off slightly, and testimony is altered slightly as we search for the truth. That doesn't mean that we are actively trying to withhold information or disguise the truth. We must look at the overall picture, examine all the data, and an- alyze the motives of all the participants before we can understand what happened at Roswell. The constant sniping does nothing to advance the research, though it provides the skeptics with the ammunition they need to obscure the truth. —Kevin Randle Cedar Rapids, IA AND REVISITED Congratulations on your July issue! It is a milestone on what I hope is the road to the truth about the Roswell Incident and the long-delayed onset of the maturation of UFO research. Many thanks for your thoughtful review of my Roswell in Perspective. I hope it inspires many MUFONers to read RiP, compare it with what others have written about Roswell and give sober consideration to this important case and its implications for the future of UFO research. My complements also on Robert Todd's article, \"LaPaz, Roswell and Green Fireballs.\" His diligent dig- ging into the Blue Book records provides solid docu- mentary evidence for what I concluded long ago about Lewis Rickett's recollections of his involvement with Dr. Lincoln LaPaz (see RiP). Further, barring the discovery of convincing evidence to the contrary, I believe Bob's interpretation of what LaPaz discussed with Earl Zimmerman (whom I \"discovered\" interviewed and \"deposed\" in April and November 1993; see RiP) — that LaPaz was talking about the investigation of the January 30, 1949, RoswellAValker AFB green fireball incident is entirely correct. Returning to your review, I am a bit concerned some of your readers may have gotten some mis-impressions. First is that Roswell in Perspective deals primarily with the Project Mogul issue, which as you know, is far from the case. I address Roswell in its entirety, including what I call the revisionist scenario advanced by Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt. As its title implies, RiP is an attempt to put Roswell in perspective based upon facts and their responsible, thoughtful interpretation. Second, with reference to the strange bodies which I am convinced were in Army custody at Roswell Army Air Field in early July, while I believe it is quite likely their origin was extraterrestrial this is by no means a cer- tainty. They may have been the result of something quite earthly about which at least a few someones in au- thority at RAAF and perhaps up some chain of com- mand did not want the public to know. In sum, belief SEPTEMBER 1994 NUMBER 317 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL that there were bodies does not necessarily equal belief they were extraterrestrial—bui does equal a conviction something very out of line was goinj: <>n about which we have a right to know. Finally, coincidence plays a much larger role in our lives than most of us realize. For instance, how likely is it that an airliner would strike an arterial road bridge be- tween Washington, D.C. and Virginia almost simulta- neously with the fatal crash of a Washington Metro subway train, together disrupting transportation in and around the nation's capital for hours? It happened in January 1982. I am sure Journal readers can call to mind many examples of similarly \"unlikely\" events. Given the high level of Mogul and possibly alien activ- ity in New Mexico s skies at the time, it is not at all un- likely a Projeci Mtiirul array and an extraterrestrial spaceship (or sonk-ining else) could have come to rest near each other on the high desert in early July 1947. In closing, permit me to add this important postscript to my letter in the July Journal re Kevin Handle's claim that Radio KGFL's Frank Joyce conducted a broadcast in- terview with Mac Brazel, precipitating the (in)famous \"captured saucer\" press announcement. On the afternoon of July 8 (!), 1994,1 telephoned Frank Joyce. Here is the relevant part of our conversation: Pflock: Did you ever interview Brazel on the air? Joyce: No! Absolutely, positively not! I never said that. Pflock: Kevin Handle is claiming you interviewed Brazel on the air on Sunday, July 6, and that's what caused the Army to put out the press release. Joyce: Eventually I put it [the story] on the air. Pflock: You put it on the air after the press release came out, right? Jovce: Now you've got it Exactly. —Karl T. Pflock Placitas, NM SCIENTIFIC STANDARDS Michael LaMoreaux, in his letter in MUFON UFO Journal Number 313, rejects Dr. Stuart Appelle's call two issues earlier for greater adherence to scientific standards in this Journal and suggests that \"good sense, integrity, and perhaps mosi ol jll open-mindedness\" are really all that is necessary in ufology. Science is all about good sense, integrity, and open- mindedness. It's about the systematic accumulation of facts and data. It's about recognizing the degree of reli- ability in each piece of data, and in the methods used to collect and analyze them. It's about the construction of logically consistent theories to account for those facts and the revision of those theories in light of new facts and data. To carry this out requires a thorough ground- ing in what is already known (and with what degree of certainty) about the discipline of study and its methods. Without such a foundation, \"good sense\" is often neither good (as in reliable) nor sensible. Mr. LaMoreaux says \"One does not expect lawyers, artists, politicians, school teachers, or detectives to be scientifically credible.\" I agree with him only about artists (unless that artist is representing himself as doing \"scientific\" work). As for the rest, I would be most interested to know exactly what standards he expects the rest of the professions he names to be per- forming to. I humbly sug»eM that society expects the work of all these people, especially lawyers and detec- tives, to follow scientific principles. And Dr. AppelJe's point, which 1 completely agree with, is that the quality of MUFON's work, and its credibility as an organization, depends to a great extent on how closely its journals and its members follow these sci- entific principles. —David Gotlib, M.D. Toronto, Ontario (The author is the editor of the Bulletin of Anomalous Experience.

Webb OCTOBER 1994 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus, still at maximum brilliancy on the 1st, gradually de- scends toward the solar glare until it disappears in midmonth. Our planetary neighbor sets about an hour after sunset on the 1st but only about 20 minutes after on the 15th. Jupiter (magnitude -1.7). in Libra, lies only about 8° above Venus in the SW and sets about 45 minutes after its brighter companion. The crescent Moon joins the pair on October 6 and 7. Mercury may be found to the right of Venus: it is, how- ever, very low from the northern states. By late October. Jupiter is also gone from the evening sky. Saturn (0.7). in Aquarius, is in the SE at dusk, moving west- ward through the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (0.8), in Cancer, rises in the NE shortly after midnight in midmonth. The brightening red planet passes through the Beehive Cluster on the 17th and 18th. At dawn the planet stands high in the SE. Saturn sets in the W about 3 AM in mid-October Comet Crash Update: The collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with the planet Jupiter more than lived up to its advance billing, becoming a spectacular event for professional and backyard astronomers worldwide as well as for the general public. More than 20 comet fragments plowed into Jupiter's backside between July 16 and 22, creating a series of huge fireballs and unexpected black spots that became visible as the big planet's rotation car- ried each into view. The black spots containing organic ma- terial were one of the big surprises: their precise origin was still being debated as of this writing. After the impacts at- mospheric shock waves and seismic waves radiated through Jupiter's thick atmosphere, giving clues to the planet's interior structure. The Internet computer system provided almost in- stant global coverage of the once-in-a-millennium astronom- ical event, including two million images of Jupiter over a two-week span. Meteor Shower: Although the Orionid shower peaks on the morning of October 22. a bright gibbous Moon interferes all night. So the normal count of 20 or so meteors per hour will not be seen. Some of the Orionids can be spotted about 5 days before and after the peak date. Moon Phases: New moon —October 4 First quarter — October 1 1 Full moon — October 19... Hunters Moon () Last quarter — October 27 The Stars: During midevening hours the celestial meridian (imaginary line connecting the north-zenith-south points) separates the summer stars in the W from the autumn stars in the E. The two great sky symbols of both seasons—the Summer Triangle and the Great Square of Pegasus—lie on either side of the meridian. The Milky Way is still prominent overhead, stretching across the sky from Sagittarius in the SW to Auriga in the NE. This subtle stellar band is best glimpsed far from city lights.

FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL OUT OF PRINT The third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is temporarily out-of-print. It has been removed from the MUFON Publications List. Work is progressing very well on publishing an expanded version to be iden- tified as the fourth edition in the near future. Please do not delay conducting Field Investigator training classes due to the absence of the fourth edition. Some sections or chapters of the present manual are only being up- dated, whereas new sections on abduction investiga- tions, animal mutilations, crop circles, and polygraph will be added. Explicit instructions on completing Form I and Form 2 will also be new. The expanded section on interviewing witnesses by Dan Wright will be another asset to the new manual. The availability date and price will be announced in the Journal. Please do not back order the new manual since it will be doubled in size, and the price has not been determined from the printer. We are very excited about the fourth edition, since it will be a state-of-the-art publication. We are targeting late 1994 for its publishing date.

Counting family memberships, MUFON has approximately 6000 members worldwide. Is the in- terest in Ufology becoming more prevalent? At first glance, the answer to that question might have a direct relationship to MUFON's growth over the recent years. In May 1989. 2016 copies of the Journal were mailed. 3008 copies were mailed with the March 1991 issue and by September 1992 the member/subscriber mailings had reached 4025. In a little over five years MUFON's growth has increased two and one-half times from 2000 to over 5000. If MUFON's growth was dependent upon the current interest in Ufology alone, it would seem logical that our major compatriot organizations in the U.S.A. would have displayed a proportionate evolution. However, this was not the case. Obviously, the real answer lies with the fundamental philosophy of our grass roots leadership at the state and provincial levels. Over the years. UFO organizations have come and gone, but none have had the organizational structure that has made the Mutual UFO Network so successful. The real heroes for our suc- cess may be directly attributed to the leadership, direc- tion, and teamwork provided by our state, provincial, and national organizations worldwide. Since this brief statement is a tribute to all of these dedicated people, please accept the thanks and appreciation of your col- leagues in Ufology for a job well-done. The MUFON Board of Directors and staff have only one purpose and that is to serve the needs of our vast network of UFO in- vestigators and researchers because these are the people who make things happen. As a new science, the future of Ufology has never been more promising than it is today. With the surge of media attention, the acceptance by scientists and acad- emics of the UFO phenomenon, and especially the fi- nancial support of the Bigelow Foundation, giant strides forward will be achieved far surpassing past historical accomplishments. The coalition executive council com- posed of representatives of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR). and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). organized to ad- minister UFO research proposals and generously funded by the Bigelow Foundation, promises to be a major ufological breakthrough for not only financial support, but close cooperation between the leading UFO organi- zations in the United States.
