Carr) Shortly after 7 p.m. on Nov. 16, 1973, two 11-year-old boys entered a vacant lot next door to the group of four houses In which they live, in Lemon Grove, Calif. After passing a clump of bamboo and coming into the open, they saw a large object about 20 feet wide and 11 feet tall sitting in the darkened 80x100 foot lot. The boys slowly approached the object, and after about five minutes Richard (last name de- leted by request) rapped on the object three or four times with the flashlight he was carrying. The rapping produced a metallic sound. The object, which the boys described as dark gray, immediately came to life. •• A dome on top of the object, about as high as its diameter, became illuminated with intense red light (a very, very brilliant spectral or Chinese red) which lit up the entire area around the boys. At the same time, the object, which had been resting on legs about 18 inches from the ground, rose to about three or four feet from the ground. A row of green lights around the peripheral rim of the object began to blink in sequence, and the object started to rotate, making a-\"not very high pitched\" sound which the boys des- cribed as \"wooooo woooo shooo.\" The rate of rotation became very high with the red light blinking on and off. Then the red light went off momentarily, came back on, and the object rose into the air, still making the sound. The boys began to run, felt chills and tingly and \"we started getting weak. We could not hardly run.\" When the boys were interviewed a short time after the sighting in the presence of their mothers, both mothers said the boys were not in the habit of concocting tall stories, and that both boys were extremely excited when they came into the house. The boys described the object as being about the size of their living room, kitchen, and • bathroom combined, which would be about 20 feet square. Later, in the field, they indicated a height against an adjacent tree of about ten or 11 feet. The investigation in the field revealed two holes in the ground, six. inches by six inches wquare, and six inches deep. They were about six feet, eight inches apart. A third partial depression forming an equilateral triangel with the two holes was apparent on a slight rise of the ground level. The holes were 40 feet from a back fence, and about 23 inches from a side fence. Dead grass seemed to be lying in a counter- C clockwise circular pattern. The ground is clayey, and was extremely dry and hard. The square holes appeared to have been sheared by something extremely heavy. Color slide photos were taken of the reported landing area the next day after a light rain had fallen.

Scan Gordon, Pennsylvania state director for MUFON, has spent a very busy 1973 investigating UFO's and creature sightings. He told Skylook on Jan. 14 that his statewide 24-hour UFO clear- inghouse investigated \"close to 600 reports\" during 1973, and this does not include the \"hun- dreds of creature sightings that were investi- gated.\" . , r Gordon got into the \"creature\" area of inves- tigation because \"there is some evidence that sonm of these creatures are UFO related. I think that the creature data is extremely important for all serious UFO investigators to be aware of. There is a great deal more involved in it from the puzzle we are beginning to put to- gether. This data will be released as soon as possible.\" he said. Gordon, who will present a paper on UFO- creature cases at the 1974 MUFON Symposium, notes that \"these creatures are apparently show- ing up all over the country. Similar creatures have been reported in Illinois, Tennessee, and Ohio in resent weeks.\" The wave of creature sightings in Pennsyl- vania began in June, and intensified in August, and Gordon had as many as five persons manning telephones and two-way radios communicating with other members of the group who were interviewing witnesses and looking for physical evidence. The typical creature has been pictured as eight to nine feet-, tall, covered with hair, walking upright on two legs, having long arms which hang below the knees, long legs* a 50 to 57-inch stride, large orange-red eyes that faintly glow, an awkward gait except when run- ning, and sound like a baby crying, and an odor like rotten eggs or spoiled meat. Evidence, that the creatures are related to UFO's is mostly circumstantial, least so far as reports thas far released, are concerned: There appear to have been increases in creature re- ports about the sane tine as there have been in- creases in UFO reports, there have been reports of creatures near the areas of hovering UFO's, and footprints and other physical evidence of creatures have been found near some UFO sites. Perhaps the most interesting case thus far publicized concerns a reported creature sight-- ing in a wooded area by two girls about 9:30 p. m. on Sept. 27, 1973. The two reported that they encountered a white, hairy creature about seven or eight-feet tall, carrying a lumines- cent sphere in its hand. Both girls were re- portedly white with chock when they returned to their house. The father of one of the girls went into the woods (he owned the property), according to the daughter, and stayed for over an hour. However, in an interview the father denied having gone into the woods, and he stated that there were somethings that should't be discussed. He Typical three-toed print found In Pennsylvania. s added that he didn't want anyone tramping a- round in his woods. The man reportedly exper- ienced a personality change following the epi- sode. After the incident described by the girls, a \"plane\" was reportedly seen shining a bright light down into the woods. Whether or not there is a tie-in with UFO's there is little doubt but that the creatures do exist. Tracks, hair, feces, and sightings by reliable witnesses lead to the almost inescap- able conclusion that these creatures have been observed in Pennsylvania during the past few months. How many of the creatures there are in ttiat area is difficult to estimate, since they have been reported both singly and in groups ( a \"family group\" was reportedly seen by five persons on a golf course one night; the witnes- ses estimated the creatures heights at four feet, six feet, and eight to nine feet). Most of the sightings have been at night, al- though there have been daylight sightings. No creatures have been captured, although at least three have been shot at. Following one shooting with a .35 calibre deer rifle, four \"clots\" of what were thought to be blood were obtained. The clots turned out not to be blood, but they have yet to be identified.

Editor's Note: The reported sighting was later investigated by David Branch and Robert B. Klinn, who have written a number of UFO stories for the Santa Anna Register. In a Dec. 5 story they reported that a neighbor of the boys had tried to use her tele- phone about 11 p.m. on the night of the sight- ing, and noted unusual static. Two days later a repairman reportedly discovered that at least two telephone lines near the sighting area had been fused together. He reportedly suggested that a strong magnetic field could have fused the lines. The Santa Ana Register 'also reported that San Diego physicist Neil Davis had estimated that several tons of pressure would have been required to make the indentations in the vacant lot. NORTH CALIFORNIA GROUP PRODUCES SIX-PAGE BROCHUR ON UFO'S, MUFOH The Northern California Division of MUFON, under, the direction of Paul Gerny, has been making a detailed six-page brochure describing UFO's and MUFON available to interested persons. Nine photos of UFO's are featured on the cover of the 1974 brochure, while the inside pages include diagrams of commonly-reported UFO shapes, a detailed account of recent closerange UFO sightings, a brief look at ancient sight ings, a short article on the reporting of sight- ings, a look at possible physical reactions caused by UFO's, and considerable information regarding MUFON and the scientific study of UFO's. FLYING. LIGHT SHAKES TOO BOYS ON LONELY ROAD The following account is taken from a report to MUFON by Lawrence Willett, Arkansas State Section Director: On Dec. 29, 1973, at about 6 p. m., Steve Flippin, an honor student in his junior year of high school, was riding with a frieSd, John Hamp, in a car to Steve's house. The road led through a heavily-wooded and more or less deso- late area about two miles northwest of Flippin, Ark. About 100 yards from an intersection, they saw a white light which f they at first thought was a reflection. The light rose to just above the level of the tree tops, and came toward them, decending to below the level of the tree tops to about 15 foot above them, and slightly in front of them. Steve, who is described as a quiet, respected youth, of high intelligence, -said the light was eight to ten feet in diameter and appeared to be a sphere. The outer fringes had a transluscent appearance, while the middle had a much brighter white light. He said he had the impression it was a solid object. Their car was moving, and they were both very frightened. John Hamp, the driver, stepped on the gas, and at that instant the. object went straight up. The witnesses never stopped to see where it went from there. They had heard no sound (the win- sows were up), had felt no unusual effects, the car lights did not dim, and the motor did not flater. (The above report was based on an in- terview with Steve Flippen; the other witness had not yet been interviewed when the report was made via letter.) MOTHER, 9-YEAR-OLD STARTLED BY OBJECT STOPPING NEAR CAR Mrs. Beverly Bechman of Waukesha Town, Wis., and her 9-year-old daughter were driving south on Guthrie Road about 6 p. m. on Nov. 29, 1973, when she noticed a very bright, almost white light which was blinking. She pulled to the side of the road, and she and her daughter watched the object through the window. The object stopped about 500 feet off the ground after moving toward the car from the east. It made no sound. After stopping briefly, the object quickly left. When the light was going away, it appear- ed to be steady. .(From Waukesha Freeman news- paper; reported by Ralph Miller.) STRANGE OBJECTS SEEN From the Jan 2 Daily Democrat, Lamar, Mo., comes a report that Vernon County farmers have been seeing strange objects in the sky. Charlie Simpson said he saw a flying saucer which was glowing and which had portholes, according to an unidentified friend who was with him at the time."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"creatures bear some resemblance to the Fouke Monster of Arkansas, the Sasquatch of the North- west, the Missouri Momo the Everglades \"Skunk Ape,\" the Maryland Syksville monster, and other, there are a number of differences, including differences in footprints. There are also dif- ferences in the descriptions given by Pennsyl- vania witnesses, probably based in part on variations in the .creatures, and possibly in part on .pre-conceived ideas of what monsters are supposed to look like. For UFO investigators, the relationship or the monsters to UFO's is more important than the similarities of the creatures to each other. An Oct. '24 incident near Uniontown, Pa., repre- sents another in a series of apparent UFO- creature tie-ins which, intrigue UFO investi- gators like .Gordon. About 15 persons-claim to have witnessed the landing of a huge reddish ball-like object, but the view of the incident reported, by George Kowalczyk is of most inter- est. . . Kowalczyk was driving when he saw an orange light in the sky over his father's field. He parked his truck, and took his -.30-16 rifle and two neighbor boys to investigate. The ob- ject slowly descended apparently to-the ground. \"This time it was completely white. It was about 100 feet in diameter, as big as a house, with a dome on top. It was very,, very .bright,\" Kowalczyk reported . to investigator Gordon. The object sounded like a large lawnmower. At about this time one of the neighbor boys spotted something moving along a fence. ICowal- czyk described two creatures, one about eight feet tall and the other about seven feet, both walking stifflegged. The creatures were com- pletely covered with a dark, grayish hair, had long arms that extended almost to the ground, were making crying sounds like a baby, and siaelled like sulphur. One of the youngsters ran away in fear, and Kowalczyk fired a shot into the air. As the creatures began to approach him, he shot direct- ly at the creatures. \"The larger creature made a moaning sound, raised his right hand, and the light in the field disappeared and the sound stopped,\" said .Kowalczyk. \"The two creatures then slowly walked away.\" Kowalczyk stated that his eyes began to bother him at the time, and that the lights on his pickup truck dimmed. Both Gordon and a state trooper noted that the witness was vis- ibly shaken by the incident. Ho physical signs of a landing were evident, but the grass had been clipped low by grazing cattle. No footprints were found at the scene, according to Gordon. (Editor's Note: while details of the Kowalczyk sighting were printed in the December Skylook, it was felt that this unique report would bear repeating as well in completing the overall creature story in Pennsylvania.) MANY WITNESS STRANGE OBJECT NEAR GREENSBORO, N.C. The following, accpunt was taken from a report filed by Dr. Arlan K. 1 Andrews, MUFON consultant The following, account was taken from-a report filed by Dr. Arlan K. Andrews, MUFON consultant: For a period of more than two hours on the night of Mov. 14, 1973, up to nine witnesses observed at least one brilliantly lighted, glow- ing object performing a variety of manauevers in a relatively dark and isolated rural area not more than five miles from the city limits of Greensboro, N. C., population 150,000. About 6:30 p. m. Sharon Mclntyre saw a bright light through the trees, heard a rustling sound in the trees, and noticed that.the dogs were upset. She and her husband watched the light for 15 to 30 minutes. It sometimes remained motionless, and sometimes made quick vertical and horizontal motions faster .than an airplane's. Another couple, the Minors, also watched the object. Mr. Mclntyre and Mr. Minor chased the object Ina car but could not tell which roads led to' it. They went to the Andrews' house, arid the Andrews, who had also seen the object, agreed that it was an egg-shaped, turquoise, and perhaps ten feet long (vertical) by three to five feet wide. Later, about 3:30 p. m., Mrs. Mclntyre and Mrs. Minor were leaving the Mclntyre home when they saw a white light .-coming over the nearby hill. They first thought it was truck headlights, but then saw that it was an oblong, flowing object light- ing up the sky and the ground around it. The women ran back to the Mclntyre porch, then back to the road. The object appeared to have backed up somewhat, and began spitting out colors in a band around the middle. Then the object made a wide sweep along the horizon,- and settled ddwn behind, the trees and out of sight. The two women were an estimated 300 feet from the object which seemed to have been about 25-40 feet in its horizontal dimensions, and perhaps five to eight feet high. The pulsating colors appeared in the center . portion of the object in a se- quence of turquoise, amber, and white, rapidly moving from right to left. Mrs. Mclntyre had the impression of more depth to the object than merely a cigar- shape, but could not be sure, since she saw only the oblong' shape. An inde- pendent observer, Harold Hopper, reported see- ing a bright white light which seemed to have been coming down for a landing about the time the two women observed the object. . *105 places to write for UFO information and clubs to join *4 authentic UFO photos taken in 1965 at Santa Anna, California *Book list on over 50 UFO titles.

The sighting took place on August 31, 1970, near Turnov, Czechoslovakia. In reply to your letter regarding the UFO I observed let me tell you the following: The ovservation was completely accidental, since I have never before paid any attention to such things, even though I have always been in- terested in happenings on the earth and in the heavesns, especially in the field of ..astronomy. I have a close friend, who is working as an astronomer. My wife had wanted to visit a former student in a distant village, who was getting married and so, I went along with her. It was evening and we were walking through the woods on our way to the train depot. It was 8:45 p.m. and the train was scheduled to leave the station at 9:00 p.m. This was when we first noticed the UFO. The station was poorly lighted and on the horizon one could see the contours of the wooded hills in a silhouette of the last rays of the setting sun. Suddenly over the horizon there appeared an object flying in absolute silence. It was emitting red colored rays of light in one second intervals. It had a trail-like light, which appeared to be about three times longer than the light rays it was shooting up from the center of the top part. The light rays being shot upwards seemed to be timed at about . once every three seconds. My wife was the first to see this object, since I was busy with cleaning my dirty shoes in a pail of water which had been brought to us by the station attended. Hearing her yelling he too ran out and then stood in wonder at this appearance. Then,.I toox looked toward the hor- izon and observed this flying object which ap- peared to be a little smaller than a cigarette filter or a Czech twenty cent piece. The base was flat and the top was slightly domed. From the center of the dome the light rays could clearly be seen shining upward. The color was wonderfully clear ruby. It was flying in complete silence, straight forward and level with the horizon. First, I thought it was some kind,, of machine, which suddenly appeared above the wooded hill line, but at second glance I had the feeling it was something very strange. My whole body felt strange about what I was seeing out there. The object left the silhouette of the hills and flew over the valley between, and it took about five minutes to travel this distance. It was loca- ted at 25 to 30 degrees above the horizon line. The total time of the entire observation was 8 to 10 minutes. The distance between the' two hills of the valley is 2 kilometers and it took 5 minutes to cross this distance between the hills.' When the object had disappeared, I looked at my wife and the station attendedt and they look- ed at me. We all felt we had seen something which was not of this planet. We almost missed our train and I told my v wife that I believed we had seen something in which I had never before believed existed. No mention of this incident was reported in the public news and I sent a report to the Ast- ronomical Observatory in Ondrejov, but I have never received any reply to that letter. Turnov is a town of 14,000 population and the location at which we saw this UFO was about\"12 to 14 kilometers from Turnov. The UFO was moving in a straight course from the Northwest to the Southeast. There were a total of three witnesses. The UFO was last seen as it disappeared behing the hill on the other side of the valley. What surprised me the most was the absolute silence'which was evident all the time of the observation. : I would estimate that we were about 2 kilo- meters from the UFO. It covered a distance of 110 to 115 degrees of the horizon. It was very bright and very clear in it;*s ruby color. That is to the best of my ability the ac- count of what I and two others observed at 8:45 p.m. on the 31st of August, 1970, at the rail- road depot near \"Turnov. : .

The two were driving on Highway 101 about 36 miles north of Paso Robles on Dec. 14, 1973, about 9:43 p.m. when they observed a hovering UFO which seemed to be shooting a steady flame- like beam to the ground, causing the earth to glow. The beam • was coming out of a black cone- shaped object which protruded from a large hov- ering sphere, according to one of the unidenti- fied veterans, now a biology major at the Uni- versity of California at Santa Cruz. The beam was.similar to a line of tracers from a heli- copter gunship, he said, but the beam was solid red with no arc to it. It was hitting the ground and throwing up dirt and other material. The pair stopped their car to get a better look at the object, which was hovering an esti- mated 800 feet from the ground. One of the Wets stated that it was bigger than any helicopter he had ever seen, and was definitely not a helicop- ter. He described it as an amber spheroid. The beam shot out and then stopped; the cone began to move into the sphere. During this manauver a cloud of vapor came out around the cone shape. The vapor was described as egg- white or chalky-white, and more or less trans- parent. The sphere itself was amber in color through most of its . center, and it gave off a white, .light. The witness emphasized that the observation took place on a very clear night with no clouds. After the cone was drawn inside, the sphere began moving horizontally, then took off at a 60-degree angle from the observers. The vel- ocity of the sphere was described as incredible, aoving from a hovering position to a point where it appeared to be the size of a star in less than 10 seconds. The two observers then, got flashlights in order to explore the area where the beam had hit the ground. The area, still glowing, was des- cribed as sort of an elipse, about 25 feet long and about 10 feet wide. The perimeter of the ring was glowing red and then yellow, but a ring in the center was not glowing. The two observers were about 30 feet apart when one of them reportedly shined his flash- light on two cylindrical shapes which appeared to him to have crinkly aluminum skins and stand about 6 feet high. The objects about 50 feet away, appeared to be almost humanoid, stated the observer, and there was a glow at the base of them. He yelled at his friend, dropped to one knee, and again shined the flashlight in the direction of the shapes, but they were no longer there. The glowing area suddenly stopped glowing after about five minutes. Soil samples and other possible evidence at the site are being collected and analyzed, according to a detailed news story of the inci- dent written by Robert B. Klinn and David Branch for the Jan. 2, 1974, edition of the Santa Anna Register, from which this acount was taken. (Information on the above sighting was repor- ted by Charles G. Kahlert.) SHINEY SILVER UFO CRUISES BESIDE WOMAN ON HIGHWAY The following account was prepared from in- formation supplied to Skylook by Mrs. Geri Wilhelm, Skylook reporter and investigator for the Ohio UFO Investigators League: At approximately 7 p.m. on Dec. 1, 1973,a woman who wishes to remain anonymous was driv- ing with her 13-year-old daughter on Route 33, near Sugar Grove, Ohio. The daughter first noticed lights in the sky, thought to be a heli- copter. Then the object descended toward the car, circling to the left of the vehicle before com- ing alongside and cruising at 35 m. p. h. (the daughter glanced at the speedometer). The craft was described as shiney silver in the shape of a cigar. It had a green light at one end, and a red light at the other. There was a pulsating white light in the center which shined into the car, becoming so bright that the woman had trouble seeing the highway. She said she felt they were photographing her. She said she was not frightened, but that her heartbeat was very rapid. The light stayed fixed on her car for at least 15 minutes. The object made no noise, and was described as being at least as large as the woman's Buick. The object eventually went quickly across the median of the divided highway, headed back straight for her car, then pulled up and ascend- ed into the sky. The entire experience lasted about an hour. After the object had left, the mother and daughter reportedly became very giddy and happy—thrilled that they had had such an experience with a UFO. MORE THAU 3,000 OBJECTS NOW III SPACE As of Dec. 9, 1973, there were 3,009 objects in Earth orbit, including Earth orbiting pay- loads, Earth orbiting debris, space probes, and space debris, from 10 nations and NATO. Of this number, 2,909 are from the U.S., and 914 from the USSR; In the month of December, 27 satellites re- entered the Earth's atmosphere,, and it was esti- mated in., the Volunteer Flight Officers News- letter that nine satellites would \"decay\" (reenter the atmosphere) during the month of January; The Soviet Cosmos 501 payload is expected to \"decay\" Fib. 10. These reentries often look like meteors or fireballs. 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Big for UFO's By George D. Fawcett MUFOM State Director, North Carolina After all but ignoring UFOs since 1969 the nation's press and news media in 1973 gave prom- inent space to sightings—both in this country and overseas. The massive wave of UFO sightings worldwide in 1973 opened up a \"new ara\" in public and official acceptance. The current flurry of UFO sightings actually started with the opening of 1972 (contrary to what is generally thought) and brought with it a flood of UFO landing reports on a global basis that is expected to spillover into 1974. Over 80 landings of UFO's were recorded and documented from 24 states in the U. S. A. and from over 11 foreign lands. Overseas these ex- cellent encounters came from such places as England, Canada, Africa, Argentina, and Austra- lia, Mexico, France, New Zealand, and Central America, with Austrailia heading the list. Stateside, such on the ground experiences were reported from North and South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Alaska, Oklahoma, California, Iowa, Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Virginia, Michigan, Mis- souri, New Hampshire, Florida, Maryland, Wis- consin, Kansas, Colorado, New Jersey, and Ari- zona. California, Tennessee, Mississippi and Georgia ranked in that order for UFO landings. Most controversial of all were the sightings of UFO occupants on the ground or through 'win- dows' in low level flights. Such encounters were reported in conjunction with landings or near landings in 12 states and two countries overseas. These experiences were recorded in Dobson and Copeland, N. C. at Gaffney, S. C.; at Robesonia, Penn.; at Balls Ferry and Chatsworth, Cal.; at Athens and Danielsville, Ga.; at Giles County and Watauga, Tenn.; at Pascagoula, Miss.; at Falkville, Ala.; at Danville, Va.; at Hampton. N. II./ at Pensacola, Fla.; at Baltimore, Md.; at Kimbra, Australia; and at Bahia Blanca, Ar- gentina. For the most part the UFO occupants (UFOnauts were around 4 feet tall, dressed in divers suits and/or white coveralls (with and without helmets) and they seemed to be busy with sur- veilance and speciman gathering. These types of reported UFO happenings almost led to panic sit- uations at varied localities across our nation and overseas. Trigger happy and badly frightened witnesses have shot at UFOs and sometimes their pilots at Ft. Beaufort, South Africa; at Griffin and Dan- ielsville, Ga.; at Gadsden and in Mobile County, Ala.; and in Georges County, Tenn. . In some of the incidents the bullets bounced back, while the emotional excitement made for bad.marksman- ship at other locations. The U.S. Air Force, the•Department of Defense and t'ne Federal Aviation Agency were involved with UFO-jet interceptions and were greatly con- cerned by the growing number of radar trackings of UFOs reported from the Eglin AFB, Fl.; from Civil Defense radar in Columbia, Hiss.; from Ft. Sill, Okla.; from Bahia Blanca, Argentina; and from Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Pilot reports of UFOs were often reported by both commercial and military pilots from Braniff Eastern, Pan American, Delta Airlines,' Colorado HORAD Air Force pilots, BOAC, TWA, Bell Huey Jet Helicopters, Scandanivan Airlines, and private Australian and Missouri pilots. General George S. Brown, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff admitted for the first time that UFOs had triggered many air, sea, land battles earl- ier in Vietnam. The DOD and FAA issued new UFO regulations, and the USAF started two new UFO studies, code-named Old New Moon and Blue Paper. Other radar trackings came from military-bases in Maryland, Arizona, Delaware, Massachusetts and Washington State. Reports of UFOs came from the governors of Ohio and Georgia, from President Abi Amin of Uganda, from Skylab-2 astronauts, from police and law enforcement officials in all 50 states, and from highly qualified scientific observers. Astronauts Gene Cernan and Gordon Cooper stated they believed UFOs represented \"other civiliza- tions\" and \"visitations from afar\" over a long period of time, a thought shared and spoken $>y Senator Barry Goldwater alBo in 1973. The 1973 Gallup Poll indicated that 15 mil- lion Americans had seen UFOs to date and that over 51% of the population had accepted UFOs as being real, both astonishing increases over the last Gallup Poll on UFOs which was taken in 1966. Dr. J. Allen Ilynek, astronomer at Northwest- ern University opened a \"Center for UFO Studies\" in early December, just after a secret Rand Cor- poration study, as well as a two-year study by the American Institute for Astronautics and Aeronautics (AISA) recommended new UFO . studies after the previous ill-fated Air Force Project Blue Book and University of Colorado Condon Committee UFO probes had failed to either ex- plain or duplicate the UFO phenomenon. While others investigate, a large number of scientific, aerospace companies and technical laboratories have set up anti-gravity and arti- ficial gravity projects, many under secret con- tracts, in an all-out crash project to try to duplicate the technology inherent in UFO ob- servations.

Electro-magnetic- interferences with car motors, headlights, houselights, CB radios, TV, radio, masnometers and other communication de- vices were widely reported in conjunction with UFO encounters, as were numerous cases of ani- mal re-actions and human physiological effects.

At UFO landing sites, impressions and ground markings, such as burned 20 to 30 ood circles, tripod landing-gear marks, background radiation increases above normal, chemical soil changes, denuded vegetation and dehydrated and depressed areas have : been found, along with many deposits of both metallic and non-metallic fragments. Many reported ammonia, sulfur-like and ozone •odors near UFOs. On Oct. 3 a motorist suffered impared vision when burned by a UFO at Jacksor', Mo. while on Oct. 19 at Rutledge, Ga. another witness was burned on her face by the heat given off by an approaching UFO. Over 170 cases of eyewitnesses being burned, blinded, paralyzed and injured by UFOs in close encounters have been documented since 1945, so that witnesses of UFOs are urged not to touch or approach UFOs on the ground un- til more can be determined about their origin and nature. Consistent features of UFOs are being repor- ted independently by witnesses thousands of miles apart. In 1973 two important books were published, both of which tell it as it really is Dr.. J. Allen Hynek's book THE UFO EXPERIENCE (a Scientific Inquiry) and Major Donald E. Keyhoe's book \"ALIENS FROM SPACE.\" For many in 1973 UFOs became part of .their experiences and alien appeared to be the correct adjective used to describe- the growing number of worldwide UFO sightings that were being reported. CHARIOTS OF THE GODS? FILM REVIEWED \"Chariots of the Gods?,\" the film version of Erich von Daniken's controversial bestseller, has been given a good review by the Atlanta Ga., Journal. In a Jan. 2 column by Barbara Thomas, the film is described as adding credibility to von Daniken's theory. A \"well-chosen musical score\" and \"imaginative photographic techniques\" are said to \"add a feeling of suspense and eeriness to what could easily have been a dull viewing of artifacts.\" Ms. Thomas notes that \"there are parts of the film where detail is conspiculously lacking, and we wish the narra- tor would give us more time to absorb what he has shown us before hurrying on to the next dis- covery.\" The Latrobe, Pa., bulletin reports that or. or about October 19, 1963 a Paul Brown of Athens Ga., saw two four-foot tall creatures emerge from a UFO which landed on the highway. Brown reportedly shot twice at the occupants, who were dressed in what appeared to be silver uniforms. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Around the Network UFO STUDY GROUP OF GREATER ST.

McKay, who has investigated hundreds of Canadian sightings over the past eight years, says his most interesting were probably a succession of burn marks. The first involved a farmer who, in 1969, was sur- prised by a bright light given off by a dome- like object in his- field. The next day a burn mark, 30 feet in diameter, was discovered where the object had landed. Soil samples showed there had been a sudden, inexplicable change in the soil's composition.

Klinn, who teams with David Branch to write UFO stories for the Santa Ana, Calif., Register, was able to get a story first hand about 2:30 a. m. Dec. 20. 1973, at Pacific Pal- isades, where he lives. Arriving home from viewing a UFO motion pic- ture film taken by a physicist, Klinn was paged by an excited'neighbor, Michael Wagner, who had been watching a large, yellowish-white, glowing blob moving very slowly over the .horizon off the Santa Monica-Pacific Palisades beach. A heli- copter -with its flashing lights was to the left. Klinn got a 16-power spyglass, and observed a vertical column of very bright, round, yellow- white .lights bisecting a horizontal line of similar' lights. Additional columns of light paralleling the vertical column would systema- tically appear, disappear, and reappear. Then the 1 whole complex of lights took on the shape of a triangle when two additional lines of lights appeared,, joining the top of the first vertical column with the left and right ends of the hori- zontal line of lights. After about 45 minutes, Klinn readjusted the telescope-and .was able to clearly see the edges of a huge, cigar-shaped machine illuminated by four or five huge, pulsating, flashing, round lights along the length of the object. The lights were much brighter than those observed earlier, and they covered most of the width of the object. The lights were flashing rapidly, but also appeared to be inter-relating with each other, seemingly smashing into each other from the right part of the cigar to the left, as if the lights traveled through each other. When the lights smashed together there was a tremendous flare-up of intensity of the light which was hit. Then the smashing activity would reverse direction. At the top of the cigar and seemingly at- tached to it was an appendage angled at about 45 degrees forward and pointed at the end. The ap- pendage had three huge lights running its length but these were not flashing as rapidly as those on the cigar. The cigar also had a \"tail\" to the right, angled downward about 30 degrees. Suddenly the top appendage began moving back and forth the entire length of the object. The ap- pendage then became vertical in respect to the cigar. Then the entire object quit moving, and appeared as a pointed dome topped disc (the ap- pendage appeared to have widened to become the pointed dome with no lights on it except for a red light at the apex of the dome). The large flashing main lights on the cigar were still visible. Then all the lights flickered for a few seconds, and then all went off. Wagner had first seen the object at 2:15 and the lights went out at 3:37.   . Klinn was told that a Santa Monica police Officer had observed the light, and estimated it .to be about one mile off the coast, but the of- ficer later denied having seen it. (From an article by Klinn in the Dec. 26, 1973, Santa Ana Register.) Missouri Sightings By Ted Phillips On Nov. 26, 1973, two coon hunters entered a wooded area north of Lincoln and encountered a large reddish-orange sphere. The hunters had just turned their dogs loose when they noticed the light across a field at low level. As they tried to approach the object they saw a herd of cattle. Suddenly they saw the dogs passing the cattle. The dogs jumped into the truck and refused to leave it. The hunters foined the dogs and drove toward highway 65. The reddish sphere paced the truck along a nar- row gravel road. As they reached highway 65 they noted another reddish sphere hovering near the highway to the south. The second object was joined by the first and they moved away at high speed. The objects were also seen by the father of the two young men at ar distance of about '2 mile. The objects were flying very near a high voltage line and parallel to it. On Dec. 2, 1973, Mr. and Mrs. Jay R. Hodges observed another reddish-orange object at about 2315. Mrs. Hodges related their experience: \"I saw this orange glow out the window toward Centerview and told Jay there must be a fire. Then I went to put on my glasses.\" Hodges him- self described the phenomena as \"a 300-foot long red-orange shape floating above the tree level.\" Hodges, who once was an aircraft me- chanic, added, \"We had about seven or eight min- utes to study the thing and I tried to think through every possible aeronautical principle for an explanation. Long before it disappeared I had decided it made no earthly sense.\" The object was shaped like a bowl. The object fi- nally moved away from the witnesses and disa- peared. The latest Missouri report took place on Jan 9, 1974 about 3 miles south of Sedalia. At 0820 the three witnesses, ages 50, 48 &27, were dri- ving west on Rte V when they saw an object be- neath the clouds-descending slowly. The object was ringed with multi-colored lights. It was seen only a short time and disappeared behind a ridge and was not seen again. The report is un- der investigation and as the object may have landed, a search of the area will be made. There is a heavy snow cover and burns or marks could be visible. Any additional information will be published as soon as available. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"In Others' Words BY LUCIUS PARISH NATIONAL ENQUIRER continues to feature con- siderable UFO material. The Jan. 6 issue con- tained two articles: one dealt with Senator Goldwater's belief in UFO's; the other told of a low-level sighting . in Chattanooga, Ten., during the October flap. The Jan. 13 issue reported on sightings in Indiana. In the Jan. 20 issue, actor William Shatner of \"Star Trek\" fame told of his experience involving a UFO and ESP in'the California desert, which he credited with saving his life. NATIONAL NEWS EXTRA also reported the Gold- water UFO remarks in their Dec. 23 issue. The Jan. 6 issue carried an article on the Goffstowh N.H., close-approach case which was featured in the January issue of SKYLOOK. The December issue of ESQUIRE contained an interesting article on Erich von Daniken and the controversy which still revolves around him. In the December issue of CHANGES, the opinion of R6'd Serling, Isaac Asiraov, von Daniken, Dr. Carl. Sagan, Dr. J. 'Allen Hynek, former astro- naut Edgar Mitchell, and' others are detailed. An interesting collection of thoughts on the UFO subject. Scottish astronomer Duncan Lunan's \"alien space probe' theories are put forth again in the January issue of ANALOG. Lunan's book, MAN AND THE STARS, is due to be published by Bantam Books within the next few months. The February issue of FATE has a report on the Pascagoula, Miss, case, but unfortunately, this was written before all the facts were made public and some of the information is incorrect. Excerpts from Major Donald Keyhoe's book, ALIENS FROM SPACE, are featured in the February issue of SAGA. SAGA's UFO Specials will be pub- lished on a quarterly basis in '74 and are now available via subscription; $3.00 for 4 issues. An anonymous Air Force sergeant is supposedly the author of an article in the February issue of MALE. It tells of various alleged sightings near Air Force bases in various parts of the country. It may be true, but considering some of the nonsense published by MALE and similar magazines in the past, I have my doubts. OTHER DIMENSIONS '74 is the first in a series of yearly annuals devoted to all aspects of the psychic, occult and paranormal. Although UFOs may not fit into either category, the magazine does contain an article on the subject, mention- ing MUFON and other UFO organizations. This is available on newsstands for $1.00. The latest two booklets from Gene Duplantier are now available for $1.25 each. These are titled SUBTERRANEAN WORLDS OF PLANET EARTH and SPACEDUST. The former is a collection of mater- ial concerning supposed cavern worlds, the hol- low .EARTH, etc. : Contributors include Richard Shaver,'Mary & Tom LeVesque (of HOLLOW HASSLE), and others. SPACEDUST is a-.collection of mater- ial very similar to Gene's OUTERMOST publica- tion of a few years ago. -It includes contactee stories, theories on lost planets and histori- cal UFOs, as well as a variety of other topics. Very.nicely put together. < SKYLOOK reader Richard Heiden has suggested that I mention a book now available in a-Spanish edition and which, hopefully, will be translated into English at some future date. It is entitled TEORIA DE PROCESOS DE LOS OVNI (THEORY OF UFO PROCESSES), written by Miguel Guasp. Sr. Guasp says it is possible to predict the site of a UFO -observation, given the local time and the latitude. For those who read Spanish arid who might want a copy of the book, it can be ordered from the author at: C/Dr. ; Vila Barbera, : 8-10a- Valencia-7, Spain. The price is $4.00. Brad Steiger's .latest paperback, ATLANTIS RISING, contains quite a bit of material relat- ing to UFOs, space visitors of old, etc. The book was written about-4 years ago, so it is not another attempt to cash in on von\" Daniken's popularity. The publisher can be blamed' for the long delay in making the book'available. Frank- ly, there isn't much here that you haven't read elsewhere, but it is still an interesting syn- thesis of ideas.

The object regis- tered on the radar screen at Turin airport, and was clearly visible to the naked eye. ' . It seemed to rest motionless in the air for several minutes and rotated on 'its axis. As police reached a spot more or less under the ob- ject it suddenly shot upwards at great speed and disappeared. Two days earlier a private pilot said he chased a UFO over Turin airport, and he esti-' mated its speed at 3,500 miles per hour.

TALLAHASSEE TO ATLANTA PLANE OBSERVES UFO AFTER TOWER ALERT Capt. R. C. Cook, preparing to charter 730 from Tallahassee to Atlanta on Nov. 12, 1973, was advised by Tallahassee FAA that the tower had seen a UFO pass over the city doing about 2,000 p.mh. at 3,000 feet, and that it was in visual contact southwest of the field and low over the trees. After taking off and completing a left turn, Capt. Cook and his crew sighted a round, glowing object low on the horizon \" and climbing away from us.\" The light, which was spherical, was pulsating from very bright to quite dim, but was always visible. The color would drift from bright red to white, and occasionally the crew would see some light yellow or green. The plane was an estimated 15 miles from the object throughout the sighting. Tyndall Ap- proch confirmed visual sighting of the object, and Panama City said it saw the object, plus two others which Cook could not see. Capt. Cook reported that the objectis movements seemed \"evasive,\" and he did not consider it prudent to attempt to close on it. After requesting clearance to Atlanta, Cook noted that the object had \"reversed its course with us,\" and now following the plane northbound At this point Cook began his descent, ending the observation.

NEBRASKA DIRECTOR KRAAL REPORTS NUMEROUS UFO's IN PAST FEW MONTHS Elmer Kraal, Nebraska State Director for MUFON, has sent us a number of reports received during the past few months, including two which turned out to be weather balloons and the re- entry of a Russian rocket. Included among the reported are: Sept. 23, 11:15 p. m. Grand Island: a green light changing to white reported 20 degrees above the horizon for 15 minutes by two witnes- ses. Oct. 7, 10 p.m., Grand Island: a gold, spin- ning object shaped like Apollo spacecraft with red lights on each side and one white light on top was reported hovering at 20 degrees for 1 hour. It then gradually moved straight east and upward to 75 degrees before disappearing, ac- cording to witnesses. Oct. 17, 8:30 p. m., Big Springs: up to six saucer-shaped objects partly hidden in haze were reported by several witnesses. The objects var- iously hovered and traveled from west to north- east. Immediately after, web-like material was observed falling to the ground (a sample is under study). Later the same evening an Inter- state 80 traveler from the west reported seeing 6 meteors or stars falling to the east. Oct. 18, 12:42 p. m., Fullerton: two duck hunters reported seeing with the naked eye and with binoculars six capsule-shaped objects, white in color with the middle third all black, flying overhead in a tight, shallow V formation from NW to SE. Sighting was for 2 minutes in clear sky with unlimited visibility. TWO WOMEN OBSERVE LIGHT HOVERING IN CHICAGO AREA The following account was taken from a flUFOM report by Laurence P. Rybak, field investigator: Two women, who have asked that their names be kept confidential, were driving in Berwyn, 111., at 5:15 p. m. on Jan. 4, 1974, when they saw a hovering object with two bright lights in front shining straight ahead, and smaller lights a round the sides. As the object began to move, the witnesses followed it for one-eighth to one-quarter mile. When moving, the two bright lights were turned off, and red tower on object was seen. The object was seen about 75 feet above the ground and about 300 feet from the witnesses as it hovered over a high school athletic field when the witnesses parked near Riverside Ave. and Home Ave. The object then disappeared from view north behind the school building at a rate of speed of a small aircraft. The large bright lights were turned off as it left. Please check the subscription expiration date on your address label to see if this is your last month for your current subscription.

Ralph has been in great demand by the news media and civic organizations as a speaker in his locality as a consequence of our recent UFO \"flap\" in the southeastern states. George D. Fawcett, State Director, has appointed Richard C. Austin, 5595 Murray Road, Winston-Salem, Worth Carolina 27106, telephone AC 919 924-8419, as the State-Section Director for these North Carolina counties: Forsyth, Guilfiord, Surry, Stokes, Rockingham, Yadkin, Da'vie, Davidson, and Randolph.

Fields F. Freeman, 1IUFON Corporate Treasurer, would like to remind members that '74 membership dues are now being received. Anyone who joined MUFON and paid their $2.00 dues during the 4th quarter of 1973 has already been credited with their 1974 dues and received their new MUFOH UFO network identification card. The cards will be issued as 1974 dues are received by your direc- tor. The world-wide coverage of UFO sighting re- ports by the entire news media during the recent flap has revitalized the interest of the scien- tific community and the general public. Scien- POLICE OFFICERS CHASE LIGHTS III ST. CHARLS John Schuessler filed the MUFON report from which the following account was taken: Reuben' Abbington and. • Alvin ' Regot, St. Charles, Mo., police officers were riding in Car 5 at 4:25 a.m. on Jan. 5, 1974, when .Lt. Regot first noticed a stationary ' light at. about 300 feet above the ground. Both officers observed the object, which they discerned as two bright oblong (retangular) white lights. Then the white lights dimmed, and a red light rotated around the center of the object. The object moved slowly west, then 'stopped and moved di- rectly toward the observers. Having stopped the patrol car and gotten outside, the officers stood their ground and Lt. Regot shined a spot- light toward the object in an effort to make out a shape (he had previously shined the light at the object when it had been stationary). The object stopped several hundred feet from the road, and barely cleared Mamelles Hills, the high point in the area. As it accelerated it made a sound like escaping steam. When the ob- ject accelerated, the officers raced after it in the patrol car-, but could not catch it. The red light and both oblong lights could be seen when the object was coming and going. CONSTABLE CHASES AERIAL OBJECT: GETS CLOSE AND AUTO-GOES DEAD . The following is based on a report by James J. LaChute, MUFON field investigator, and a story in the New Orleans State-Item: On Oct. 7, 1973, Constable Charles Delk was called to a Petal, Miss., address to investigate a reported sighting of a UFO. Nothing was seen until Delk was driving back, when he spotted an object over Petal High School. He described it as \"like an old-tiney top\" with a short antenna on top. The wide portion was upward, and was surrounded by a yellow band of light. Its estimated diameter was 30 feet. Delk says the object hummed. The object was followed for approximately 30 miles, and Delk says four lights were flashing. The object went toward the Tallahalla Swamp, but when Delk got \"pretty close to it\" his motor \"killed.\" The motor remained dead for about 15 minutes, during which time the motor would not grind and his radio did not work. When his car again started, \"like nothing was wring,\" he again followed the object through the town of Ovett and past a swamp. Then the object reportedly did a \"double flip\" and dissapeared tists were quietly stepping forward to volunteer their services in an effort to help resolve the greatest scientific problem of our time. The sensationalists and \"kook fringe groups\" are being phased out of the UFO picture. They are being replaced with the educated and exper- ienced scientists and engineers who are bringing Eheir expertise to bear upon this enigma. 16"}]
