Schuessler MUFON UFO Symposium July 22-24 If you are ready for a series of new evidence-based papers aimed at resolv- ing the UFO mystery, then you won't want to miss the 36 th annual MUFON International UFO Sympo- sium in Denver, CO, this July. It is being held at the Marriott Tech Center Hotel on July 22-24. Room rates are only $65 per night at this John Schuessler world-class ho- tel situated in a wooded campus set- ting. The location is about one mile south of the site of the 2004 MUFON symposium. You will be able to meet, hear, and talk with the speakers about the results of their work. Unconventional Flying Objects are real, unusual, and consis- tent in their behavior. These research- ers will present the facts about what is going on and more. Phyllis Budinger will present the results of her laboratory analysis work on evidence from several UFO inci- dents. Richard Dolan, author of UFOs and the National Security State, has researched nearly every aspect of the UFO mystery, from flying triangles to the government cover-up, and will bring you another powerful segment in his continuing research. Elaine Douglass has been research- ing the reports of solid UFOs turning invisible as they fly. You will be sur- prised at what she has found. Frank Feschino, Jr. will chronicle his ten-year study of a UFO crash in West Virginia (the Flatwoods \"Mon- ster\" case) and the many UFO incidents surrounding these events. Nuclear physicist Stanton T. Fried- man, holding the record for presenting the largest number of papers at the an- nual MUFON meetings, will present an all-new paper on Government UFO Lies.

BB Absolutely not. This sort of substance you wouldn't want to ingest. As a matter of fact, in some cases it's been radioactive, so I certainly wouldn't want to eat it. LTP What are the characteristics of angels hair? BB It's generally snow white, fi- brous, superficially resembles spider web-and even serious ufologists and researchers have written off angel hair cases as nothing more than ballooning spider web. Spiders use silk to migrate on convective air currents, so for years and years that's been the explanation fork. LTP Now, how did you get involved with it, apart from your sighting in 1989? BB Well, quite frankly I just got bored with reports of nocturnal lights in the sky, you know, anecdotal reports, and there's nothing you can really do with them, and I wanted physical evi- dence, tangible evidence. Actually, an- gel hair is a CE 2-close encounter of the second kind; it's a trace left by a UFO, and it's tangible evidence. LTP Okay, we're going to have a look at the picture as you're talking more about that, Brian. BB This is an interesting fall. This happened in Horsehead, NY, in 1954, and it was actually radioactive. There was some conjecture that it had drifted over from the nuclear test out in Ne- vada, but it wound up in New York in February, and it was kind of odd to be that far away-and also the fact that it fell in February is not indicative of mi- grating ballooning spiders, because they don't migrate in February; that's win- (Continued on page 4) FEBRUARY 2005 Video clip from the Trade Austin-Peters' interview with Brian Boldman. The MUFON UFO Journal and Let's Talk...Paranormal are cooperat- ing in making some of the interviews from the show hosted by Tracie Aus- tin-Peters available to Journal readers. Let's TalkParanormal was created in late 2002, and to date has produced 35 shows. Tracie decided to produce and host the show because of her own in- terest and experiences with the subject since 1987 (see December, 2003, MUFON UFO Journal). The show can be seen in Santa Clarita Valley, CA, on Mondays at 10 PM on channel 20, and there is a re- peated show on Wednesdays at 5 PM. Lets Talk...Paranormal is also net- worked in Tucson AZ, Saturdays and Sundays (see www.accesstucson.org for details), and is simulcast on the world wide web at that time (AZ time). It's also broadcast in Iowa five nights a week, and most recently is broadcast as a radio show on Quality Beats Ra- dio, www.qualitybeatsradio.com.

He became inter- ested in aviation at a young age, which led to a pilot's license and a career with a major airline as an FAA airframe and powerplant me- chanic. After witnessing two UFOs over Charlotte, NC, in 1989, he began a study of the phenomenon, which led to angel hair research. He has com- piled a data base of over 250 cases. He has been published in vari- ous newsletters, including the In- ternational UFO Reporter, and has self-published \"Angel Hair Newsclippings, 1947-2002,\" a col- lection of 60+ newspaper articles. He has appeared on the Bob Heironomus radio program, Hilly Rose Sirius Radio, and OVNI Televista, as well as at the National UFO Conference and MUFON NC.

LTP Right; just getting back to the picture that we just saw, Brian, how did that gentleman discover the angel hair. BB He was actually a chemistry professor at Almira college in New York, and was called in to investigate, and they had a geiger counter that picked it up as radioactive. And that's not the only case. We've had cases where it's had tritium, which is man made. It's made in nuclear reactors, which is very odd for a spider web. You can imagine the spiders that would produce that. Another property which is indicative of it not being spi- der web is that it sublimates-it changes state from a solid to a gas, like dry ice would. As an ice cube does, it goes from a solid, to a liquid, to a gas. Angel hair has been known to vanish upon han- dling. I guess the light and heat of a hand would make it just simply disap- pear. So temperature may do it, and it typi- cally falls on clear days when there's a low humidity, and that may have a bear- ing on how this stuff is produced by our little friends. I did a study on angel hair. I went to the Library of Congress and different archives, and found all the articles or the data I could find on angel hair from 1947 to 2000. Then I did an analysis of the data, and what I found in 215 cases during that time period is that 57% of the time UFOs are involved with the fall of this material, and in 40% of the cases the material sublimates to nothing-to a gas. A substance fell in Vicelli, Italy, on Nov. 8,1999, and we have another case coming up later which I believe was collected by Tom Brewer from Sacra- mento. Well that actually fell over here in California, on the eleventh, three days after the Vicelli fall in Italy, and that sample we've now had analysed, which we'11 get to. We've done comparisons with spi- der web, and the fibers in this angel hair are much finer. The data shows it is much thinner than spider web, and it doesn't contain the glue drops that spi- der web would have on it. LTP Yes, because you know, if you look at a spider's web, it is very strong, but there's no way it looks that white and as thick; there's no way. BB That's correct. It superficially does, and that's what's thrown people off who have researched it. But the devil is in the details. You have to really look at all the data-spider web is a polypep- tide protein, and a spider's web is five times as strong. LTP ...Polypeptide protein? What does that mean, Brian. BB Well, it's an organic substance that's produced by the spiders with dif- ferent glands, and different proteins coming together to form a web. But angel hair on the other hand su- perficially looks like it, but when you look at the data, and you look at the fact that in 40% of the cases, people un- known to each other separated both by geography and time, have reported the same properties of sublimination, and 57% report UFOs over head... LTP .. .And it's all over the world. This is a wide phenomenon, except for... BB All over the world, except for, I think, Antarctica. I don't know, but it's probably just a population density situation. LTP This goes back how far in time? BB When you go back it is kind of hard to pin it down exactly as to all the information, because you don't have any current witnesses, but the earliest case, I think, was 50 B.C. in Marseilles. It was reported there and recorded by historians of the time. LTP Well, we'll go into this a little further later on. As we saw in one of your slides, there was a craft traveling across the sky, and there was a trail left behind it. BB Absolutely. LTP Now, are there certain UFO types that emit this? BB Absolutely. It's mainly a day- time phenomenon. Actually, afternoon, and what's mostly associated with it are the cigar shape and the disc. LTP Yes, because I did some re- search into your research, and basically you were suggesting that discs and sau- cer-shaped crafts were 32 cases at 44%, globes and sphere-shaped UFOs were 21 cases at 29%, cigar shapes were 10 cases at 14%, and \"others\" were 9 cases at 12%, so the highest is the disc and saucer shape. Why do you think that is? BB Well, if these are our little friends from who knows where, it could be like having a Ford or a Chevy. You have different makes of vehicles, and these particular makes, these particu- lar producers, are the ships that pro- duce the angel hair filament. I have a suspicion that it has to do with acceleration or propulsion, be- cause there have been several dozen cases where the witnesses have re- ported that when the UFO departs, the angel hair falls immediately. LTP Okay, and the weather condi- tions have to be... BB Clear, and that's why it's mainly in the fall of the year.. .actually, to get right down to it, I think the humidity in the atmosphere is what's really impor- tant to produce this stuff, and it could very well be that these ships during the summer time when there's a lot of hu- midity in the atmosphere, they don't produce it for that reason; there's many fewer cases in the summer time. LTP We saw a slide of angel hair in.a fresco. What do we have here, Brian? BB This is a fresco of a pope in Rome who supposedly had a dream where he had seen a white substance fall from the sky, and was instructed that this would be a miracle, and that they would construct a Basilica on the spot. Low and behold, the following day on 354 AD on a hill in Rome, this sub- stance fell, and then they built the Ba- silica on the spot, the Basilica of St Mary Major in Rome, to commemo- rate this event. They have a feast of St Mary Major, or St Mary of the snows, MUFON UFO Journal FEBRUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"on Aug. 5 every year, where they drop flower petals from the balcony of the Basilica. LTP So they're celebrating this as some kind of sacred thing, BB I think so. I think when you get right down to the frescos, I think that's what it was. They took what would be to our mind a UFO, a CE 2, and turned it into a religious type of event. LTP That's interesting stuff. I just want to mention, Brian, that in some of your research, you actually wrote about the times when angel hair falls. You wrote that the average time is 1:30 to 1:45 PM. BB That correct. It's an afternoon phenomenon, and that is what has led people to jump to the conclusion that it's ballooning spiders. Okay, what hap- pens is they migrate during the morn- ing, and then they align in the afternoon, but when you look at the details, when you look at the fact that 57% of these cases from 1947 to 2000 involved UFOs, well we have a problem. LTP Well the thing is with balloon- ing spiders that I can't quite get my head around, Brian, is that wouldn't this bal- looning spider have to be native to most countries on the globe. BB Absolutely, and it's been blamed here in the US on a species called \"Linifide,\" and that one species is not indigenous to a lot of areas where this stuff has fallen. There's another very important point about all of this.. .spiders also migrate in the spring, and we don't have a big spike in the spring. Also, October is generally a dry month; you have very low humidity when these falls happen. A classic ex- ample would be a clear blue sky on a fall day, and a UFO seen, a silver ci- gar, globe, or a disc, either shooting off or doing maneuvers. LTP Right. Isn't it the anniversary of the first sighting today? BB That's absolutely correct. Whitsett was 1955-it's a little town just east of Greensboro, NC. This is an in- teresting case because not only did a whole class see this-they were all out early on recess-but the principal and all the school teachers had also. I've since located two of them and spoken with them. LTP Oh, you have? BB One of the children I found, an insurance agent in Greensboro, still remembers it, and the principal was named H.D. Lambeth. He had been in the Second World War, had his wings, and had flown combat missions over Burma. He asked the children to bring him a chair, got his binoculars out of his car, sat down, and watched what he called eight ball bearings, \"steel-looking ball bearings\" to quote him exactly, and these things cavorted overhead, then disappeared over the horizon. Then this stuff just fell all over the school yard. There were about 60 students, and they were so excited by what they had found that the principal said, \"Oh well, school's over with.\" Another interesting thing about that is he had taken a sample, put it in a piece of construction paper, wrapped it up, put it in his wallet, then locked it in a filing cabinet in the school-and only he and one other person had the key to that. Well, the sample vanished, and he doesn't know what happened to it, or where it went. LTP So the sample in the paper, the whole thing was gone? BB The whole thing. The construc- tion paper and the sample inside the locked filing cabinet vanished. LTP My goodness. Okay. We have some kind of a report here Brian. BB Yes we do. This is a Project Blue Book record card. Project Blue book was the Air force's Investigation into UFOs, and this case happened in Marysville, OH, and in Union City, IN. It was spread out over a wide area, and even though a principal had wit- nessed a UFO, Project Blue Book blew it off as spider gossamer, or ballooning spider web, and here we had a UFO that shot off, leaving a trail of angel hair over three miles. LTP Three miles. Is this quite a stretchy substance? BB It is, and as a matter of fact, it seems to be contradictory, because it seems to be strong and tough to break, followed by it's complete sublimation to nothing. Now that's a very strange property. It points to me that it's defi- nitely not a spider's web type of mate- rial. LTP I'd say not, and you know what, I have a friend in the UK, and as a small boy, he found some of this an- gel hair after a UFO sighting, managed to find a little match box, placed it in- side, closed it, hurried off home to show his parents, and when he got home and opened the box it had totally disap- peared. BB Classic. That's a classic ex- ample of sublimation. This is what has been reported time and time again. These witnesses are separated by con- tinents and time. These witnesses don't know each other, and report the same things. LTP I 'd like to mention a few \"head scratchers,\" Brian, written in the UFO Reporter. The results of analysis by several different professional people are strangely contradictory. \"It is a significant fact that none of the scientists identified the material as the web of a ballooning spider.\" \"Six scientists of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Indus- trial Organization have studied the threads, as the threads have a melting quality. They are further puzzled.\" \"A fiber technician with Burlington Industries tested a sample of the angel hair and said it was not cotton, wool, or any commercial synthetic yarn. He suggested it might be spider webs, or a similar animal material. But a Greens- boro biologist examined a sample of the angel hair under a microscope, and said that it was unlikely a spider's web.\" BB Absolutely. We get this time and time again in the data. You have a game of animal, vegetable, or mineral. You have the animal people saying, \"Well it's got to be a plant material,\" and the plant people saying, \"It's got to be an animal product.\" So they don't know what to do with it, and you can imagine what happens when someone sends them an example for analysis, and when it gets to the lab there's nothing in the container.- LTP You know, if anybody finds any of this angel hair, Brian, what would you suggest they do? BB Number one, document as much information as you can. If you have a camera, take pictures. I would suggest using a clean air-tight con- tainer-this is important-and a clean FEBRUARY 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"utensil if possible. It's a good idea if you can get something like a drinking straw with the wrapper; collect it with that, because we need clean samples that are not contaminated. LTP So don't touch it under any circumstance. BB Don't touch it. And another thing-to stop sublimation you can ei- ther increase the vapor pressure inside the vessel that contains it, or you can cool it. So I would suggest to people to get this stuff inside a vial. Stop at a conve- nience store and get a bag of ice and put the vial right in the middle of it to preserve it. LTP So you would give it that kind of temperature? BB I would, and ideally we would want to store it cryogenically at a very, very low temperature to avoid the sub- limation. It's important if people get a sample in a sealed container to not open the lid, because that is just going to let the gas out. If they keep the gas in, we can do gas chromatography on it, and get analysis that way. LTP Are you the only researcher, Brian, doing this? BB No, there's a few in Australia doing it. There's one in the UK, I think, and there's one in Italy, but none of them have done the extensive research that I've done on it, as far as I know. LTP So in most of the cases where people have had the UFO sighting, they have seen a craft and then they discov- ered the substance. Has there ever been a situation where a craft hasn't been witnessed and the material's been placed there. An analysis Boldman notes that \"We now tra indicate there are. have a contemporary analysis that can shed light on the molecular com- position of angel hair. Phyllis Budinger of Frontier Analysis Ltd., a very skilled analytical scientist with the capability to do Fourier Trans- form Infrared Spectrometry (FT-IR) with a Nicolet Avatar 360 spectrom- eter, and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), completed this work. Here are her results from a sample recovered in Sacramento, CA,onNov. 11, 1999:\" The \"angel hair\" consists of fi- brous material with protein amide type linkages showing it is from an animal/biological source. The data (FT-IR) compare closest to refer- ences of silk It is definitely not from cobwebs. [emphasis added] The fibers also have small amounts of an ester type material and other components on the sur- face. There are also volatiles associ- ated with the angel hair. So far light branched hydrocarbons have been identified (GC/MS). Another test is being done (FT-IR over time) to determine if there are other volatiles. Some current spec- They consisted of: 2-methyl pro- pane; 2-methyl-l-propene; 2-methyl-1-butene; 2-methyl pen- tane; 3-methyl pentane; hexane; dimethyl-pentane; 2 C 6 H (molecu- lar weight=84) hydrocarbon struc- tures (specific isomers unidentified); one C g H, 6 hydrocarbon (molecular weight=112) (specific isomer uni- dentified). Also indicated are carbo- nyl sulfide (COS) and carbon disul- fide (CS 2 ). There are possibly heavier hydro- carbons present, such as two C 20 H 42 components and a C 23 H 43 compo- nent. \"This sample compares with FT-IR spectra in other samples that Budinger has examined,\" adds Boldman, \"and there is no question of the composition. It is positively identified as containing secondary amide linkages similar to protein, and compares closely to silk. \"This would seem to add ammu- nition to the spider web theory, but the seemingly biological origin by no means proves this. Also, the addi- tion of volatiles seems to contradict the spider theory, and may explain sublimation. Moreover, Budinger believes this is not web material.\" BB It has, it has. We do have cases where it's just found on the ground, and I have a feeling there that probably UFOs are actually unreported, because most people don't look at the sky. LTP No, they don't. BB It could very well have passed overhead and discharged it, and they find it on the ground or off branches and wires, that sort of thing, so I prob- ably think UFOs are unreported. LTP How would you take this a step further? BB Well, actually we've already done that. We've had samples recov- ered and returned to us, and we' ve done all kinds of analysis now on it. We've had the gas chromatography done on it, and infrared analysis has been done on it, so we basically know what it is, and it is not spider web. LTP It doesn't even look any where close to spider web; it's too thick, too white. BB Well, absolutely, and for in- stance a couple of chemicals have been found in it. (See box on this page.) LTP Well, I know that Brian would like you folks at home to do some in- vestigation of angel hair, and you can actually email Brian if you have any angel hair discoveries, and if you'd like more information. email: ufoah@earthlink.net Web: angelhair.info Ph/fax: 336.595.3660 Object reported by NC couple On June 22, 2004, a 47-year-old college graduate and his 40-year-old wife were on the deck of their home in Mecklenburg, NC, at 6:10 PM when he noticed a flying object which ap- peared to be at a \"very high altitude.\" He watched it until it stopped, then went inside and got his binoculars, which he shared with his wife.

Moreover, it has also been suggested that the Indian government has been in contact with these entities, and may make an announcement to this effect. Joe Trainor of UFO Roundup is re- portedly working with three stringers- two in India and one in China-as well as with an Indian UFO organization, in an effort to determine what is occur- ring. The English language newspa- pers in India have also been covering the events. At this point, there is more specula- don than hard evidence, with too many unnamed sources (i.e. who specifically among the military and government have allegedly made statements?). There has also been too much specu- lation regarding military movements which may have mundane explanations. In addition, we do not know how reli- able some of the reporters or newspa- pers are. The reports, in fact, seem to contra- dict each other, as we are told by one source that UFOs are suspected of shooting down planes, while another source tells us they are peaceful. The following reports are being pro- vided so that Journal readers can be up to date, whether or not there is any- thing to the speculation.

They have been a reliable fighter plane since we began ordering them (in 1985- J.T.),' the official said, speaking on con- ditions of anonymity. \"The following day, India's newspa- pers reported that the pilot had not sur- vived the crash.

Neehar Gururani last night, the IAF has lost its second pilot in a Mirage 2000 jet crash,' the newspaper reported. \"Gururani's aircraft hit the ground about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from IAF Gwalior. With this crash, the IAF has lost six Mirage 2000 jets so far- three of them during the past two months alone. (J.T.'s Note: To say nothing of the IAF MiG-21 that went down in the western desert near Bikaner on Nov. 1, 2004. See UFO Roundup, Vol. 9, No. 46 for Nov. 17, 2004, \"A shootdown in India?) \"IAF Vice-Chief Air Marshal S.K. Malik said on Nov. 10 (2004) that pre- liminary evidence shows the pilot may have been 'disoriented' due to the dark- ness, so there was no reason to suspect technical or engine failure. Initial re- ports had said the pilot was safe, but then the rescue teams reached the site and found Gururani's body. (J.T.'s Comment.- So India's Top Gun became \"disoriented,\" eh? Riiiiight! And if you believe that, you probably think it happens to Chuck Yeager, too.) \"The IAF sent its Director-General of Flight Inspection and Safety, Air Marshal P.S. Ahluwalia, to probe the reason behind the recent series of Mi- rage crashes. '\"The crashes have been surprising indeed. The Mirage continues to be our finest fighter,' Malik said. \"A spokesman for Dassault, the French firm that built the aircraft, said, 'We are waiting for a final report from the IAF on the crash. From the infor- mation that we have received, it seems possible that the pilot was disoriented; which is why he may not have pushed the panic button.' Gururani was part of a two-plane formation that took off from IAF Gwalior. His wingman sounded an alert when Gururani did not respond to ra- dio inquiries and disappeared from the radar screen. \"When the second pilot failed to con- tact Gururani, he retraced his flight path to find a ball of fire on the ground. The dead pilot is the son of IAF Air Mar- shal S. Gururani, who retired in 1997 as the commander of IAF Maintenance Command. \"Malik said, 'We have seen his fit- ness reports. He was a good pilot and an enthusiastic boy. It is rather unnerv- ing that this has happened.' \"The IAF has ordered ten more Mi- rages to make up for the crash losses, and an additional squadron is expected to arrive by year's end.

The pieces are now at the National Metalurgical Laboratory in Jamshedpur for tests. After this, they will be sent to the Dassault factory in France for ex- amination. Indian ufologists are questioning why Gururani's Mirage descended to 900 meters (3,000 feet) before disap- pearing from military radar. Ufologist Daniel Wilson is now com- paring UFO reports from India and Pakistan with news accounts of jet crashes in the subcontinent, to see if there's any correlation. \"Until Daniel brought it up, we had not considered the possibility of a clan- destine air war. But India has lost six Mirages and one MiG-21,\" said Krishnari Bai Dharapurnanda, UFO Roundup correspondent in India. \"A Mirage was lost on Sept. 23 (2004). This was at the same time many UFOs were seen over Himachal Pradesh (the Himalayas-J.T.), and there were reports of aliens building a base in the mountains overlooking the upper Sutlej River valley. Gwalior is in India's Madhya Pradesh state approximately 300 kilo- meters (180 miles) south-southeast of New Delhi.

U.S. participates in Cope India Some observers have suggested that the fact that the U.S. has been training with the Indian Air Force shows that there is some tie-in with reported UFOs and UFO bases. If so, the evidence is elusive. The latest round of joint exercises in India, known as Cope India, was Oct. 21-25,2004, at Agra Air Base, India. Pacific Air Forces sent C-130 air- craft and 150 personnel from Yokota Air Base, Japan; Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, and Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The two militaries have participated in training exercises and visits since 1962, when the first U.S.-India mili- tary exercises were held after the Sino- Indian border war, but not to the de- gree in these recent exchanges. The Air Force exercises-the latest Cope India was the third in six months- are a continuation of President Bush's policy toward India. After Sept. 11, when India was one of the first nations to offer the United States help, Bush lifted U.S. sanctions and called for a more open relationship. During Cope India in October, the U.S. Air Force and Indian air force exchanged information on airlifts, plus loading and unloading operations and procedures. Previously the air forces from the United States and India participated in the second Cope India exercise Feb. 15- 27,2004. That exercise at Gwalior Air Force Station, India, provided training for aircrew and maintenance personnel. Both forces conducted their first bi- lateral dissimilar air combat. U.S. Air Force assets participating included F- 15 aircraft and approximately 140 per- sonnel fromElmendorf AFB, Alaska. A variety of Indian Air Force aircraft participated, including Mirage 2000, MIG-21, MIG-27, SU-30 and Jaguar. During this exercise the U.S. air- crews were surprised at the capabili- ties of the Indian Air Force, consistently losing in simulated air-to-air combat exercises. The reasons for this were explained as (1) the restrictions on equipment used, and (2) the skill and tactics of the Indian pilots. None of the six F-15Cs used by the U.S. was equipped with the newest long-range, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars. At India's request, the U.S. agreed to mock combat at 3-to-l odds, and without the use of simulated long- range, radar-guided AIM-120 Amraams that even the odds with be- yond-visual-range kills. U.S. participants say the Indian pi- lots also showed unexpected skill, in- novation, and flexibility in their tactics. This suggests that the Indian pilots are indeed first-rate professionals, making the recent rash of crashes even more unexplainable. News of Alien presence startles India UFO ROUNDUP, Vol. 9 No. 52. Posted on behalf of Joseph Trainor. Dec. 29, 2004 \"India was startled by four reports last week which appeared to confirm the rumors of a large underground base staffed by extraterrestrials in the Ladakh region of the Himalayas. \"In New Delhi, India's capital, a se- nior officer of the Indian Army told freelance journalist Subha Jain that aliens were indeed in the Himalayas. \"In Leh, a city in the Ladakh region, a local official confirmed that the In- dian Army had moved armored bri- gades into the area and was limiting ac- cess to civilian residents and tourists. \"According to Subha Jain, she bumped into a very senior military of- ficial in a nightclub in New Delhi. Ac- cording to him, the extraterrestrials have been visiting India and the rest of the world for thousands of years. '\"In recent years, most of the super- powers have been visited. India is no exception. They always make contact through the ground radar stations run by the military,' she says. '\"The Himalayas and Ladakh is where they have made their most re- cent contact. They want to let Indians know the rules and regulations of the multidimensional universe. '\"India is planning an unmanned moon expedition, and later an advanced unmanned Mars expedition. India's Space Research Organisation (SRO) has been given the galactic do's and don't's.' \"Last week, a flight commodore of the Indian Air Force (IAF), who re- cently retired, was asked to provide a little talk to his youngest son's class at a school in Bangalore. \"Guess what he picked as a topic?

Residents live at altitudes ranging from 2,750 meters (9,000 feet) at Kargil to 7,672 meters (25,170 feet) at Saser Kangri in the Karakorams. \"In summer, temperatures rarely exceed 27 degrees Celsius, while in winter they plummet to minus 20 de- grees Celsius, even in Leh. \"In Leh, Ladakh (region), according to Tsering Spalzang, a senior official, paranormal activities are happening with regard to the buildup of the Indian Army in the region. \"These are zones that the Indian Army and Indian Air Force block for security reasons. The Ladakh valley has been heavily secured by the Indian gov- ernment. \"It is a 'sensitive area,' and no one is allowed to enter from either the In- dian side or the Chinese side. \"According to some in New Delhi, UFOs have made contact with high- ranking officials of the Indian govern- ment. \"The government was initially baffled, not knowing how to react. Later, things became quiet, and it seems that everyone understands that the ex- traterrestrials are friendly.\" Will India be first nation to acknowledge UFOs? India Daily Jan. 6, 2005 \"New Delhi is in the middle of a big secret internal debate. On one side the largest democracy of the world is ea- ger to explain to its citizens and to the world about the ongoing contacts with the UFOs and extraterrestrials. \"On the other hand there are invis- ible untold international protocols that prohibit doing anything that may cause worldwide fear and panic. \"It is well accepted among the UFO and extraterrestrial experts that all the five nuclear powers are in contact with the beings from other stars for quite some time. \"Recently India has seen enormous news on UFO contacts and secret UFO bases in the Himalayas near the Chi- nese bases. \"In Ladak, for example, the locals clearly point out the everyday phenom- enon of large triangular spacecrafts coming out below the ground, and In- dian security forces protecting them. \"Military officials and politicians have confessed the fact that India has been contacted. India has been told the rules of the Universe. \"The current debate is on whether to keep it secret like other countries are doing, or in tradition of a total trans- parent society come out and tell the truth. India is so open and democratic; it is very difficult to keep a secret for long. \"If the information comes out through unofficial channels first, and then the authorities are pressed against the wall to confess, two bad things can happen. \"First, it can really cause a panic in the country, as well as the world. Sec- ond, the way the Indian politics is run, the ruling party will be thrown out of power in no time if it is ever found that the Government withheld such infor- mation from the public. \"The recent rush of world leaders to India is remarkable. Russian President Putin to major Senators from America have visited or are planning to visit In- dia. European Union is in deep discus- sion with India on cooperation. \"All sanctions against India's nuclear programs and Indian Space Research Organization are in the process of be- ing lifted. India is cooperating with Eu- ropeans and the Americans in space ex- plorations and technology research pro- grams. \"India is also part of the World Trade Organization. India is receiving major outsourcing contracts in IT and call- center service work from America and Europe. \"India's Forex reserve is at a level never imagined before because of in- ternational direct investments from Western nations, Japan, Korea, and oth- ers. \"Interestingly, China, the arch rival of India, changed its posture in the last few years to make India's friendship and trade a priority. \"India is slowly getting to the point where it is accepted as a permanent member of the Security Council. All of the five Security Council members, China, America, Russia, France, and the UK, support India's inclusion. \"When all these factors are added to- gether and analyzed, it seems like In- dia is being told by the world to abide by the hidden protocols, and in ex- change be recognized as a major emerging superpower. \"The debate the country is facing in- ternally is whether to abide by the laws of the world and the Universe to be rec- ognized as a superpower or be truthful to its citizens and the world. \"According to sources close to the Government, the UFO contact is known by quite a few politicians in the oppo- sition, and of course by those who are in power. The military has legitimate concern of not letting the secrets out either. \"Recently, India's foreign affairs minister, Mr. Natwar Singh, came out and said that for India it was not neces- sary to become a nuclear power. He is a strong supporter of Mrs. Indira Gandhi, India's former Prime Minister who initiated the nuclear program in the mid sixties. \"India first exploded a nuclear de- vice in Pokhran in the early seventies. The whole country, including people from his own party, questioned Mr. Singh for such an irresponsible state- ment. \"But on analyzing his statements, it is evident, that based on what he knows now, being a nuclear power really does not matter much, because the technolo- gies controlled by the extraterrestrials are so advanced that all our technolo- gies mean really nothing. \"But importantly, he may be irritated with this controversial ongoing secret debate, and what he really meant was that if India was not a nuclear power, the debate on UFO and extra-terrestri- als will never be there in India.\" Case reports Investigators.

She is a homemaker and is currently pregnant with her llth child. She called him after her sighting, and he passed the investigation on to me. John Buder and I met with Carolyn (42) and three of her four daughters who wit- nessed the event. There were two ad- ditional children present at the interview who were not witnesses. The children who were witnesses who were present for the interview were: Emily (20), Virginia (16), and Irene (13). Irene has a twin, Katherine, who was also a witness to the event, but was not present for the interview. The initial interview took place on Aug. 28 at the local library, and a sub- sequent on-site interview (at their home) took place on 8/31/04. Virginia was the only one present for the second interview, and she rode in my car, in the passenger seat (the same seat she had when she witnessed the event), and took me through the series of events as I drove the route the fam- ily had driven the night of the encoun- ter. In addition to narrating their story, the family also drew pictures of what they had seen, and pictures of the area where the incident occurred. Those pic- tures are included in this report. The encounter On Monday evening, 8/16/04, at approximately 10:50 PM, Carolyn Joyce and four of her daughters were driving in their 15-passenger van to their home at 1830 N. 101\" St. in Omaha, ME. It was a clear evening.

Virginia Joyce, 16, who was riding in the front passenger seat, was the first one to see something in the south/south- western sky that she thought was an extremely low-flying airplane, which seemed to be directly over their house. She called attention to the \"plane,\" and the other witnesses in the car also sighted the object. Virginia's first view of the object, approximately 75 degrees above the horizon, was unobstructed. The object seemed to be hovering over their house. The longer the group watched the object, the more the group realized that the object was not a plane. They de- scribed a dull, gray, disc-shaped object with a dome-shaped top that had a bright white light at one side of the disc, and multicolored lights (red, green, blue and yellow) at the other side of the ob- ject. There was a yellowish light that ran in a band around the center of the disc. There appeared to be a \"beam of light\" that was \"shooting down\" from the bot- tom of the disc that one of the witnesses described as a \"dimmer, see-through light.\" The object was low enough that it was obscured by the neighbors' trees as the van continued toward the wit- MUFON UFO Journal nesses' driveway. The group became very excited as they realized that this was not an airplane hovering over their house. It apparently did not make a sound. (Carolyn reported that she may have heard a \"type of wind sound,\" but that the house is not too far from two busy streets, and she couldn't be sure. None of the other witnesses reported any sound associated with the object or event. The witnesses said this is what convinced them it wasn't a plane. As they moved toward the driveway, the object began to move toward the north/northeast. When the van arrived at the driveway, it was directly under- neath the object. The object was de- scribed as being treetop level, which was later estimated to be 75-100 feet high. At this point, the object appeared to change shape and looked similar to an airplane, but it was \"more triangular-shaped.\" The white light at the end of the object became brighter at this time. The witnesses thought the colored lights were also still evident. The van stopped in the driveway; and the passengers \"jumped out\" to get a better view. The object was estimated to be approximately half the size of a football field-larger than their house. At this point the object seemed to be disc-shaped again, and \"shot straight up into the air and disappeared.\" Right FEBRUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"before the object disappeared, the white light appeared to get brighter. The wit- nesses reported feeling excitement mixed with disbelief, turning to appre- hension and fear. They were also angry that it had left. One of the daughters, Katherine, 13, who was not present at the interview, reported that she had a headache, and Irene, her twin, reported smelling a \"burning hair smell.\" The family owns horses that are kept behind the house. The horses didn't ap- pear to be affected in any way, although one of the daughters mentioned later seeing a \"large clump of [horse] hair on the ground.\" No time loss was noticed, nor any other physical effects/symptoms. At some point during the sighting, another relative, Aunt Katherine, also drove into the driveway to drop off some other children. She did not see anything, nor did any of the children she was with, but the witnesses noted that she was busy unloading children from her car. The witnesses drew sketches of the object in both disc shape and triangular-plane shape. They also drew a sketch of the disc in relation to the treetops, and a sketch of the area of the sighting. These are included in the full report. The entire event lasted less than a minute. There are power lines around the house and there is a large electric power station not far from their house on 108th and Blondo St. Additional notes Even though Virginia saw the object first, and had the best view of the ob- ject, Emily gave the most comprehen- sive description of the event. She was seated in the next seat back in the van. She was described by her mother as having a \"sixth sense,\" and has had \"strange\" experiences before, though not necessarily related to UFOs. One experience involved Emily al- most hitting a man standing in the road while she was driving during the day. Instead of hitting him, she \"drove right through him.\" She thinks she may have had other UFO sightings, but nothing like what she witnessed the night of 8/16. She has friends who live in Columbus, ME, and FEBRUARY 2005 while driving the highway to visit them, has seen \"an object hovering off in the distance.\" She reports, \"One time [an object] shot in angles and left;\" and \"one time an object was moving across the sky, then suddenly changed directions.\" These all happened at night. The mother thinks that after the night of 8/16 she saw a \"bright light in the sky,\" but couldn't be sure. And, a 22-year old son, who no longer lives at home, once saw something outside the house when he was 13 years old. He was playing basketball, and ran into the house saying that he saw what the family described as a UFO-type object, and \"he saw windows and ev- erything.\" I have asked the family if the son might want to tell his story, and they said they would ask him. Nebraska State Director & Central U.S. Director Dr. Jack Kasher's Comments This is Kathy Wheeldon's first in- vestigation since passing the Field In- vestigator test earlier this year. She has done an outstanding job of reporting what I consider to be a genuine sight- ing of a saucer by four witnesses-a mother and three of her daughters. The mother, Carolyn Joyce, was a physics student of mine about twenty years ago, and I have kept in touch with her over the years because of her strong interest in UFOs. I consider her an ex- tremely reliable and grounded person. She told me that she actually played devil's advocate with her three daugh- ters in order to be as objective as pos- sible about the sighting. She called and woke me out of a sound sleep a few minutes after 11:00, shortly after the sighting ended. I wasn't too alert, but at least remembered to tell her to write down everything she could recall, and that I would assign someone to the case. I then assigned Kathy, and she did an excellent pair of interviews and wrote the fine report included here. I think this is a very credible case with four reliable witnesses. I didn't realize until I read Kathy's report that the family lives only two blocks from me here in Omaha, and that the saucer actually moved toward my house before it shot up into the sky. MUFON UFO JOURNAL Part 2 Four experts explain why scientists should study UFOs (Continued from January issue.) Reprinted, with permission, from the cur- rent edition of the Journal of the British In- terplanetary Society (BIS). * By Dr. James Deardorff, Dr. Bernard Haisch, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, & Dr. H. E. Puthoff Sightings since Condon Report The self-inconsistency of the Condon Report, along with the strengthening of Fermi's paradox through recent devel- opments in cosmology, physics, as- tronomy, and astrobiology, are but two reasons to reevaluate the UFO phenom- enon. Another reason is that remarkable sightings did not cease with the publi- cation of the Condon Report in 1969. Many detailed sightings since then have become available for examination. Scientists should not feel reluctant to study these, inasmuch as the Report's executive summary stated that \"any scientist with adequate training and cre- dentials who does come up with a clearly defined, specific proposal for study [of UFO reports] should be sup- ported.\" One example of sightings worth studying are those that occurred on Dec. 31, 1978, off the northeast coast of South Island, New Zealand. These involved several channels of informa- tion recorded on tape and film during the sightings, correlated visual air and ground radar detections, and light phe- nomena recorded on color movie film, as well as reports by the eight witnesses who were involved. Analysis of the recorded data and of the witness testimony indicates that unknown objects emitting bright light were detected on radar, filmed, and ap- parently moved in response to the mo- tions of the airplane carrying the wit- nesses. The sightings have defied all mundane explanations [31-32]. Some investigations of unexplain- able sightings have been sponsored by 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"governments outside the U.S. Since 1977 the French Space Agency has carried out an official investigation of UFO reports with its project GEPAN, later called SEPRA. In the Belgium sighting wave of 1989-90, civilian and military officials cooperated in sharing eyewitness, ra- dar, and video-image data of triangu- lar-shaped craft. Withheld information available The Condon investigators did not have full access to the information and analysis compiled previously by the U.S. Air Force Office of Intelligence (AFOIN) or to all the information col- lected by Project Blue Book. Much of'thi's information has been disclosed in the years since 1968. The information release has come about on five fronts. ~ \"\" First, the U.S. Air Force released the complete files of Project Blue Book in 1975. This release included the previ- ously unavailable files of the Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI). Second, the U.S. Freedom of Infor- mation Act, which went into effect in the mid 1970s, resulted in the release of relevant information from other agencies (Federal Bureau of Investiga- tion (FBI) in 1977, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1978, etc.), though often in a censored form [23-24]. A third new source of information is the collection of previously withheld reports and analyses carried out by the AFOIN in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This information has been re- leased in the last 20 years as a result of standard declassification requirements for old documents. It shows that Air Force intelligence privately concluded that as many as 5% of the sightings were - unexplainable, even though \"they\" were apparently ac- J curate reports made by credible observ- ers, thus contradicting the public state-- ments of the Air Force that all sightings could be explained. The documents provide an explana- tion as to why Air Force intelligence told the FBI in August and again in October, 1952, that some top Air Force officials were seriously considering the \"interplanetary\" explanation [33]. Fourth, governments of countries other than the United States have, over the last 25 years, released relevant in- formation collected by their armed ser- vices and police. Not only has the French government through GEPAN and SEPRA, released sighting documents, but also England's Ministry of Defense recently released a number of documents. The govern- ments of Spain and Canada also re- leased documents in the 1970s and 1980s. Moreover, some governments be- sides that of France have official inves- tigative groups on this topic. In 1997, in response to civilian and military sightings over the previous years, the Chilean Air Force formed the Commit-,, tee for the Study of Anomalous Phe- nomena (acronym, CEFAA in Span- ish), directed by a former Air Force general and headquartered in the Tech- nical School of Aeronautics in Santiago. One of us (Maccabee) was invited to Chile in 1999 to lecture at a sympo- sium sponsored by the CEFAA, and to discuss the sightings. The Peruvian Air Force set up a similar group in 2001. Brazil and Uru- guay also have comparable investiga- tive groups. A fifth new source of information not available or utilized by the Condon group consists of the many witnesses to events in the 1940-1960 decades who had worked for the government or the military, and after reaching retire- ment age have come forward to divulge their first-hand knowledge [34]. They have felt it was more impor- tant for the citizens to know what has been taking place than to continue to obey instructions to maintain silence about it. A reluctance to report UFO events arose because of a curtain of ridicule which, since the 1950s, had settled over the subject. It was induced in part by the CIA's 1953. Robertson panel that recommended a debunking program against the reality of the phenomenon [20,22-23]. The debunking is most often imple- mented by an authority figure assert- ing, at his own volition and without in- terviewing the witnesses, that whatever was observed and reported as extraor- dinary was instead the misidentification of something mundane. This is demean- ing to sincere, credible witnesses. The major news media quickly picked up on sarcastic phrases like \"little green men\" and \"UFO buffs,\" then gradually weaned themselves away from the topic-reporters, editors, and corporate owners fear ridicule, whether just or unjust, as much as do scientists and politicians. The refusal of the U.S. Air Force in the 1950s and 1960s to release sight- ing data it had collected only added to the problem, since evidence collected by the government was not available to support the witnesses [33]. The first director of the CIA assessed . the situation in 1960 as follows: \"Be- hind the scenes, highranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about - UFOs. But, through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to be- lieve the unknown flying objects are nonsense... to hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel\" [35]. The Condon Report also added to the problem, since it demonstrated that men of science could simply allege that witnesses are mistaken or dishonest and they would be believed by most of their colleagues, even though they had no evidence to back up their allegations. This in rum led to greater reluctance on the part of witnesses to come for- ward. As a result, \"the most credible UFO witnesses are often those most re- luctant to come forward with a report of the event they have witnessed\" [27]. This ridicule factor has prevented many serious investigators from even attempting to report their findings within the journals preferred by most scientists. Therefore, one of the recommenda- tions made by the moderator of a 1997 panel of scientists is that journal edi- tors should change their policy of re- fusing to even seriously consider pub- lishing articles related to the UFO phe- nomenon, so that this difficulty may be alleviated [3]. Inferring an ET Strategy If one allows that at least some un- explainable sightings may be manifes- tations of extraterrestrial intelligence, then there is yet another reason for re- evaluation: a growing recognition over the past two decades that a large part 12 MUFON UFO Journal FEBRUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"of the behavior manifested can be viewed as being quite rational. The topic of ET behavior has re- ceived considerable discussion in con- nection with SETI in the past three de- cades. SETI has proceeded on the as- sumption that Fermi's paradox is to be solved through continued and enhanced searching of the sky for electromagnetic signals indicative of ET communica- tions [37]. Several possible reasons for lack of success to date have been proposed [1,37-38]. Since the 1970s, advocates of a covert ET presence in our vicinity have also been advancing their hypoth- eses or scenarios. They reject as improbable the as- sumption that space-faring ETs must be dominated by the most evil and aggres- sive of their kind, an assumption whose consequence would be that we should not be existing as a freely developing civilization within a fully colonized and/ or explored galaxy. Contact optimists instead presume that many advanced ET groups are at least as ethical as we are, while still at- tending to their own safety and secu- rity. The ET motivation for space travel could be to increase their knowledge through exploration of space, rather than to colonize and seek domination [39]. Thus hypotheses have been set forth regarding why such ETs would be aware of our presence, but not yet have contacted us overtly. Among these are the zoo, nursery, and quarantine or em- bargo hypotheses [1,38,40-42]. Most of these posit that the ETs in- volved have frequently scouted us out semi-covertly and have concluded that we are either not yet mature enough for open contact, or not prepared for it, since any abrupt, overt contact could cause societal chaos and governmental downfalls. Also postulated is that ET interfer- ence with our society would prema- turely bring an end to our civilization's continued development if it occurred before our knowledge has progressed to the point that we could understand where the aliens could have originated and how great their head start over us could be [39]. A serious inconsistency in this rea- soning, however, is that maintenance of total ET covertness towards Earth and the solar system would still lead to so- cietal chaos whenever the covertness or embargo was eventually lifted, un- less the ETs carried out a program of gradual disclosure-a \"leaky\" embargo [1,43]. Although the zoo or embargo hy- pothesis may be unverifiable, the leaky embargo hypothesis may be verifiable if the UFO evidence is taken into ac- count. Much of this evidence appears to constitute just such a leak in the embargo: a grass-roots educational pro- gram in the form of the phenomenon which has been in operation since 1947, if not before. Many sightings have been of a na- ture to attract attention to their craft and let isolated groups of witnesses know that its occupants are aware of us [24,44]. A key category of such cases in- volves reports wherein persons within a traveling vehicle frantically witness an object pacing them, even though their automobile or aircraft makes turns that rule out the sighting of an astro- nomical or other ordinary object as an explanation. Similarly, in a number of the aircraft cases the unknown object, which was either pacing the aircraft or presenting itself to it, was detected on radar as well as visually [23-25,27]. The object's extraordinary appear- ance, maneuverability, and oft-times coincidental interference with the vehicle's electrical system additionally rule out mundane explanations [23-25). Although individual, localized, and usually brief sightings may have pro- vided sufficient evidence to be convinc- ing to the observers and sighting ana- lysts, the fact is that, since the widely-reported sightings began in 1947, no event has persisted in a promi- nent place a sufficient number of hours at a time, or demonstrated its abilities to enough witnesses at a time, for the news media to congregate and publi- cize it to the world. Nor have they left quite enough evi- dence behind to be totally convincing to very many scientists [25]. We sus- pect that this chary behavior may be no accident. To put it another way, from the viewpoint of investigators studying such phenomena, individual close-encounter and other sightings can be very intrusive and overt. However, from the viewpoint of the scientific community, and society as a whole, this is not the case because of the relative rarity in time and space of convincing sightings, and because of the limited numbers of witnesses in most instances. The inference is that, by not provid- ing sufficient evidence to make their re- ality totally obvious to scientists and so- ciety in general, the ETs are following a strategy or program that avoids in- flicting catastrophic shock to society as a whole, which any overt contact could cause, while preparing us for eventual open contact. This could say something about their level of ethics. Proposing a certain level of ET eth- ics is not new; it was suggested in 1981 that advanced ETs may abide by a Co- dex Galactica that would require them to treat emerging civilizations delicately [1,45]. Such a standard of behavior is con- sistent with reality of the UFO phenom- enon and the fact that not in the past 56 years, nor in past millennia, have we been colonized, conquered, or extermi- nated, nor has society been traumatized by any ETs or by their sometimes pos- tulated robotic probes [1,41]. It is also consistent with the failure of investigative panels to find that UFOs constitute any direct threat to na- tional security. On the other hand, it appears all too evident that ETs have not intervened in world affairs in any benevolent manner that would have forestalled human warfare, famine, and disease. In fact, ample cases exist wherein the witnesses, when too close, were in- jured or harmed. Other cases exist, however, in which a witness was healed of some injury or medical condition [46]. All this suggests that ET interac- tions with humans are based on a neu- trally benevolent ethical level overall. Conclusions Despite the UFO phenomenon hav- ing continued now for over two gen- erations, the huge technological head start of the presumed ETs would still come as a great shock to many scien- FEBRUARY 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"tists as well as citizenry, as the Brookings Report indicated [47]. It could be so great as to seriously chal- lenge our consensual reality, a not in- significant danger. The implication that we would be powerless relative to their presumed capabilities and evolutionary advantage may be most unwelcome, with it being no surprise that science would have dif- ficulty coming to terms with the situa- tion [48]. Nevertheless, the reality of the phe- nomenon and of our having long since been discovered by advanced ETs now may be more probable than that Fermi's paradox is to be resolved through ei- ther the non-existence of advanced ETs or their inability to explore or colonize the galaxy. Hence open scientific research on the subject is needed, with special atten- tion paid to high quality UFO reports exhibiting apparent indications that ET intelligence and strategy are involved.

Truck driver gets close look at strange object Occurred: 8/19/2003 05:15 Location: Council Bluffs, IA Shape: Unknown Investigated (telephone interview only) by Beverly Trout, MUFON State Director for Iowa. She reports, \"In my telephone inter- view with this gentleman, Kenneth Beougher, 53, it is quite evident that he is as verbally articulate as he writes. \"This is one very intelligent indi- vidual, with a thinking, observant mind, and who for 3-4 minutes had a rare and unique opportunity-which he took ad- vantage of by observing as closely as possible this UFO's close (and linger- ing) position right next to his truck.\" Ms. Trout forwarded the following write-up which the witness did for the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), directed by Peter Daven- port, and she indicates that this matches what the witness told her: While driving the company's 18 wheeler on 1-29 just north of Council Bluffs, IA., I saw something through the top right of the windshield that looked like an airliner (but too many lights), banking, then dropping down (about 1 mile out). When I looked back to the road briefly, I almost couldn't find it again, but saw it hug the ground and cross to the interstate beyond the next overpass. When I drove around a mild curve and went under the overpass, it was ahead of me about 1/4 mile over the ditch moving northbound as I was. I left my truck in cruise at 60 MPH. It only took a few seconds to catch up to it. It slowly picked up speed as I got nearer and when I was just up to the rear lights, it was traveling about 2 MPH slower than my 60 MPH, so I studied the craft the best I could. The bottom of the craft was only about 20'-25' above the road surface to my right, and the leftmost white light (1 of 3) was just to the right of the truck cab. What I could see clearly were three brilliant white circular disc-shaped 14 MUFON UFO Journal FEBRUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"lights, about 4' in diameter, forming an equilateral triangle about 4'-6' apart, 2 leading and 1 trailing center. A single bright red circular disc of lights approximately 3' in diameter was located in the center of the 3 white lights. When approaching from the rear, I leaned forward to look up behind the lights, but couldn't see anything but black and a faint smoky or black misty wake like a boat would leave in water. It looked like it could have been fol- lowing the underside of the craft, but I really couldn't tell. The white lights were brilliant, and looked like a hundred-plus bulbs in a disc, but were too bright to see the light source, but they did not blind the eye when looking right at them. The light they gave off had a flood-like appear- ance and lit the ground and the truck cab very well (about like halogen). The red disc of light was bright red, but did not glare as much, and I could see what appeared to be maybe 30 or more bulbs. The actual count could be higher. This craft appeared as though it was waiting to be inspected, but was so close I couldn't see it all. The craft continued to fall behind at the 2 MPH rate until it was well be- hind the trailer, then slowed consider- ably as I continued at 60 MPH. When a mild hill and then another overpass came, I could still see the bril- liant white light glowing upward in my mirror, even though I was possibly a mile or so away and over the hill. That was Tuesday, and I wasn't routed that way all the rest of that week. The following Sunday I drove down there to investigate the area during day- light. The ditch in that area extends ap- proximately 50' over to a row of utility poles that are about 35'-40' in height all along the area where this occurred. Since all during the event I could not see the size or shape of the craft, this may help in some way. Also, I didn't get the precise loca- tions of these. However, I noticed there are a few lines coming from the utility poles and crossing 1-29 at various points and appear to be elevated only about 21 3 the way up these poles. FEBRUARY 2005 Maybe that explains why the craft backed off when it did. I think it might have had to stay below radar or some- thing. When I first saw it bank and drop, it went over to 1-29 almost hugging the ground, and I think it may have dropped where Loess Hills protrudes upwards just east of the interstate. Also, I forgot to mention the craft moved along like it was on rails, not even a wobble or bump, nor did it have an angle of attack. It was perfectly level. I couldn't roll down the right win- dow (it isn't powered and it isn't safe to reach that far), but I had on an empty trailer and was on fairly flat ground, and the motor wasn't real noisy, and I did not hear any noise from the craft over the moderate motor and tire noise of the truck. (NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded exceptionally credible to us. PD) Two witnesses to same object Date of incident: 29 Aug 2003 Time of incident: 10:30 to 10:40 PM, Pacific Daylight Time Atmospheric conditions: clear sky, moderate temperature, near 60° F Investigator: Tom Bowden, MUFON Oregon State Director Summary: A large black triangular object with lights near the comers was seen flying slowly over a residential neighborhood. Two known independent witnesses ap- pear to have observed the same object. Additional witnesses were seen by the first witness, but these witnesses were never located. Witness #1 and #2 are not known to one another, and have never met. I have not provided either witness with any specific information about the identity of the other witness. Both witnesses seem credible, and I could find no rea- son to suspect a hoax or collusion be- tween them. Narrative - Witness #1 This narrative is based on the wit- ness' original account, with corrections and clarifications based on subsequent interviews with the investigator. Witness #1 was driving west on Di- vision St. in Gresham, OR, when he noticed what he first thought were bright landing lights on an aircraft, in- cluding one white light and one red light. By the time he approached the corner of N. Main St. and Division St., he noticed that the lighted object did not appear to behave like a conventional aircraft, because it appeared to be sta- tionary in the air. As the witness continued driving west on Division St., he continued try- ing to observe the lighted object to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL left of his direction of travel. He could not maintain continuous visual obser- vation due to watching his driving, and due to tall trees in the area. As he reached the proximity of NW Wallula Ave. he could see that the ob- ject was nearly directly to his left and partially hidden by the tops of the tall fir trees in the residential neighborhood along the south side of Division St. Knowing he had a digital camera in the car with him, he decided to try to get closer to the object in a place where he could stop and photograph it. He turned left (south) on NW Angeline Ave., where he turned off his radio and fan, and rolled down all the car windows to see if he could hear any sound. He could hear no sound from the object at this point. He proceeded to SW 5th St and turned left (east), where he had a very clear view of the object directly ahead through his windshield, unobstructed by the tall fir trees in the area. This street runs due east. In this quiet residential block, he slowed down to take a good look. He saw a triangular shape with bright white lights on the bottom side at the three corners. When asked about the red light initially observed, the witness said he could not explain why the red light was no longer visible from this vantage point. (Note: This detail does not agree with his original statement.) Between the lights, the witness could discern a dark gray or black object with straight edges forming the sides of the triangle shape. The witness noticed that the body of the object seemed solid, because it 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"eclipsed stars that were behind it. The object hovered completely silently and very steadily, with no wobbling or drift- ing motion. The witness tried to compare the object with a known type of airplane or helicopter, but found that it did not look or behave anything like any known con- ventional aircraft. At this time he noticed other people who also appeared to be looking at the object. Two men on NW 5th Street had stopped what they were doing and were looking up at the object. Two girls were running down the street, yelling and pointing toward the object, and a man driving in the direc- tion of the object was sticking his head out the open window of his car, look- ing up at the object. None of these other potential witnesses have been located. From this location the witness ob- served the object hovering for 10 to 15 seconds. He stated that he had a clock on the dashboard of his car to help him judge the elapsed time. Based on the reference of NW 5th Street, which runs due east, the witness states that the object was almost exactly east of his position, or just slightly to the left (north) of due east. The witness was about to reach for his camera and get out of his car to take a photograph when the object began to execute a slight lateral rotation without banking or wobbling, then began accel- erating off toward the northwest. He then decided to follow it. He pro- ceeded to NW Towle Ave., and turned left. He had to slow down for several speed bumps on that street, and by the time he reached Division St. again the object was receding in the distance to- ward the northwest. He turned left on Division St., drove a block or two west to a place where he had a clear view to the north and northwest. From this location, he ob- served two white lights at the tail of the object as it glided rapidly off toward the northwestern horizon and disap- peared in the distance within a few sec- onds. (Note: In his original narrative, the witness incorrectly stated this direction as northeast. He realized that mistake afterward, and made the correction.) After losing sight of the object, the Computer drawing by Witness #1 witness drove home and wrote notes about the incident. He later contacted the National UFO Reporting Center. Narrative - Witness #2 Witness #2 contacted me in response to flyers I posted in the vicinity. These flyers depicted a wire-frame style draw- ing of the object made by witness #1, and gave the time/date of the sighting. The witness claims she and her sis- ter (also a witness, but declined inter- view) had an immediate strong reac- tion to the picture because it looked just like what they had seen. Although they were initially not sure about the date, I questioned her about what she was doing the night of the sighting, thus establishing associations with other events in the time frame from which they were able to verify the date. Witness #2 was sitting in the front yard of her duplex apartment talking to her sister when she noticed a bright light above her illuminating some objects around her. She looked up and saw a large ob- ject with three brilliant white lights ar- ranged in a triangular pattern moving from behind the branches of a large Douglas Fir tree. She noticed that the apparent body of the object was dark and apparently non-reflective, and that it eclipsed stars as it moved across the sky. The wit- ness reported that no sound was heard. The object glided smoothly toward the north for about 3 seconds, then Drawing by Witness #2 stopped and hovered for about 2 to 4 seconds in a position toward the north- east, above a medium size tree. During this time the witness, who wears a pacemaker, states that she felt a disturbance in her chest similar to the effect of a magnetometer (metal detec- tor) on her pacemaker. Next the object executed a slight lat- eral rotation without banking or wob- bling, and quickly moved out of sight behind the treetops toward the north. She is really not certain if the object moved away quickly, or if it simply van- ished, but she thinks it just moved quickly out of sight behind the trees. When asked what time the sighting occurred, the witness said that she spent about five more minutes outdoors, watching the sky, and that when she went indoors it was 10:45 PM. During further questioning about the presence of conventional aircraft in the area, this witness stated that between one and five minutes after the depar- ture of the triangular object, she saw and heard a large airliner fly over her location on a general heading toward the north, probably on approach to Port- land International Air-port (PDX). The witness easily and accurately de- scribed the characteristic lighting con- figuration of the airliner, and pointed out that the triangular object's lights were nothing like the airliner's lights. Analysis I interviewed witness #1 at his home 16 MUFON UFO Journal FEBRUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"on Sept. 9, collecting background in- formation, and reviewing and clarify- ing his original statements. On Sept. 16 I conducted a walk-through of the sight- ing with him, visiting the locations where the observations were made. While the witness raised his arm to indicate the angular elevation of the sighting, I measured the estimated angles using a tiltmeter. Compass directions were provided separately by the witness, based on a compass in his car. I added the correc- tion of 17 degrees for the local mag- netic deviation from true north. The due east-west orientation of NW 5th St. was verified. I interviewed witness #2 on Sept. 28 at her home and measured angular ob- servations from her front yard, where the sighting occurred. She identified two trees and a utility pole as landmarks to help her remember where she ob- served the object. Observational data from Witness #1: Total duration of sighting was about 8 minutes from beginning to end of the narrative. The estimated angular size of the object as seen by witness #1 from NW 5th St. was about 2 inches at 16 inches from the eyes. Observational data from Witness #2: The object was observed from a few feet outside the front door of her apart- ment, approximately 975 feet from the location of witness #1 at point B. The total duration of the sighting was esti- mated at about 8 seconds. The moment when the object seemed to hover lasted an estimated 2 to 4 seconds. The ap- parent angular size was 3.5 to 4 inches at 18 inches from eyes. Air traffic in the vicinity: Eric Byler of Oregon UFO Research obtained an air traffic map from Jerry Gerspach of the Port of Portland Air- port Noise Abatement department. The map shows commercial aircraft equipped with air traffic control tran- sponders, and gives altitude, airspeed, and aircraft type information for all known flights. It also displays a date and time stamp. The following aircraft are marked on the report: DH8D (De Havilland-8 turboprop) has departed PDX and is turning north- east over Vancouver, WA, at airspeed 231, and altitude 5,666. This aircraft is out of the observational area and can safely be excluded as a cause for the sighting. B734 (a Boeing 737-400) is on final approach to PDX, at 1,486 feet and a speed of 163. This aircraft would have been far to the north and traveling on a west-northwesterly approach path, with the landing lights aimed toward the west. Also, it would have landed by the time of the sighting. This aircraft can also be safely excluded as a cause for the sighting. MD80 (an MD-80) is approaching from 10 miles to the south at 4,961 feet and at a speed of 274. The path of this aircraft would have taken it over the sighting location during the time in question. It would have covered the 10-mile distance in about 2 to 3 min- utes. This aircraft must be considered as a possible cause for the sighting. The chart shows its path passing nearly di- rectly over the vicinity of the sighting. B763 (a Boeing 767-300) is ap- proaching from 14 miles to the west at 6,998 feet and at a speed of 231. The path of this aircraft would have taken it over the sighting location during the time in question. It would have covered the 14-mile distance in roughly 3 to 4 minutes. The chart shows its path pass- ing about one mile east of the sighting location. This aircraft must also be con- sidered as a possible cause for the sight- ing. Conclusion: Both witnesses claim to have seen and heard many aircraft in the Gresham area at various times of any given day or night. The Gresham area is a busy air corridor with a lot of traffic to and from Portland International Airport and Troutdale Airport. Both witnesses were able to easily describe typical aircraft lighting con- figurations, and both witnesses stated that when they first saw the object, they compared it to a conventional aircraft in an attempt to rationalize what they saw, but then concluded that it was not a normal aircraft. Witness #2 remembered seeing a commercial jetliner heading north about one to five minutes after the sighting of the triangular object. There is not enough information to definitively say which aircraft she saw, but she de- scribed the aircraft lighting configura- tion as clearly different from the un- known object, and also stated that she could hear the aircraft, and that it was quite loud. Although witness #2 stated that the hovering UFO seemed to cause a flut- tering feeling in her chest, it is not pos- sible to determine whether this was in fact a physical effect upon her pace- maker. It is also possible that she expe- rienced a startled feeling upon realiz- ing that the object was performing a maneuver not possible for any conven- tional aircraft she knew about. At the time of the closest observa- tion by witness #1, he describes ma- neuvers and an estimated altitude on the part of the object that would be totally inconsistent with any known commer- cial aircraft. He estimated the altitude at 500 to 800 feet, which would have been well below the altitude permitted for a com- mercial aircraft over the area in ques- tion. At this time, I maintain the opinion that both witnesses saw the same uni- dentified flying object. Both witnesses reported the same structural details and the same time frame (around 10:30 PM), although they disagree about the length of time the object hovered steadily. Both witnesses agree that, after hov- ering, the object executed a slight lat- eral rotation just before moving sud- denly to the north and then disappear. Additional calculations are included in the full report. Acknowledgments Peter Davenport, director of the Na- tional UFO Reporting Center, initially received and posted this report and some of the follow-up communications on the NUFORC website. Eric Byler of Oregon UFO Research initially referred this case to me. Eric also investigated the possibility of the misidentification of a commercial air- liner, and has concluded that the sight- ing of witness #1 can be attributed to a misidentification of one of the aircraft.

At the time the area was a real hot spot for UFOs. I did a lot of hunting for rabbits and other varmints while we owned the property. \"I was going along a river bed look- ing for something to shoot with my .22 auto rifle when I heard a noise. Look- ing in the direction of the sound, I saw a disc in the Manzanita brush just hov- ering about a foot off the ground. \"It scared the hell out of me at first, and I shot at it with my 22 rifle (prob- ably not the thing to do). There was no effect, and I fell on my butt trying to get back away from it. \"When I fell, I was only three feet from the disk, so I know what I was looking at. I saw no aliens, and within a few seconds it rose up to about 20 feet and shot away quickly. \"It was only about 8 feet across and 3.5 feet high, kind of small. It was the color of those Ruger guns that they call target gray. I did not see any insignia on the craft. I took off back to the cabin and told my parents what had hap- pened. \"The only reason that they believed my story, I was shaking like a leaf in a wind storm. Later my stepfather and I went back to the spot and found some small prints about 4 inches in length, and a Manzanita branch that was burned on one end. \"I never went back to that spot again, and did not report it to anybody else. I did not want to sound like some of the locals that reported men from Mars. I was 13 at the time and remember it like it was yesterday.\" 18 George Filer New Hampshire UFO video Paul Spera writes, \"On Dec. 17 my girlfriend and I were sky watching through our glass sliding doors. We had several sightings over the weekend and were just getting restless when I noticed a large cluster of lights flying over our back yard. It was traveling southwest, and was at an al- titude of approxi- mately 1,000 to 2,000 feet. \"I had filmed the same object the night before, but this time it was closer. It ap- peared to have one large light surrounded by smaller lights which were all bright white, forming the shape of a ramp. \"It had no strobes, and was com- pletely silent. I had my camera, so I went on the deck and taped the object as it slowly flew between the gap of trees in my back yard. \"It continued west, and can clearly be seen flying behind the trees in the video. Frame by frame analysis shows that the lights independently changed from white to several different colors quite rapidly. More images can be seen at my website.\" Paul Spera New Hampshire UFO Hunter Website Australia disc URANIA, S.A. - The witness re- ports, \"One night in April, 1975, a friend of mine called me and asked if I wanted to go spotlighting for foxes. I said yes, and traveled to his farm 10 miles south of Maitland, arriving there about 9 PM. \"After going inside and chatting for a while with my friend Brad, his mother Pam, and another friend Michael, I said that I was going outside to get things MUFON UFO Journal ready to go spotlighting. As I walked out the back door (facing east) I noticed what I initially thought was a large shooting star coming down from the east and to the south east. \"But the shooting star stopped dead at about 20 degrees above the horizon and began traveling across the sky to- wards the east and flashing blue red and white lights at 9:15PM. \"I yelled to the others, 'Come Out Here NOW! Look At This!' They came running out, and we all stood in the back yard watching as the UFO traversed the horizon. I got my rifle out of my car and began watching it through the tele- scopic sight, and was amazed to see it was about 40 meters across and about 20 meters high. \"It was disc-shaped with windows around the edge of the disc and a flash- ing dome on top. It had a polished alu- minum top, and it looked so close that I had to move the scope to see all of it. \"Brad went to get his binoculars while Pam, Michael, and I took turns watching through the rifle scope. After about 5 minutes Brad came back. He had been watching it through the bin- oculars, and I could see from the porch light that he was as white as a ghost. \"The UFO was now around 1,000 meters away and traveling towards us. I got scared and was going to have a shot at it, but was told off by Pam, so I lowered the rifle. As I did, the UFO started to retreat and slowly move off to the north towards Maitland. \"We kept watching as it became just a red flashing light until it was over the eastern side of Maitland, where it hov- ered. Four other little red lights seemed to enter the (mother ship) UFO, and then the UFO took off in a slight arc to the east and disappeared in less than a second. Pam, Brad's mom, said, 'Oh I've seen them before. They'll be back!'\" Thanks to Brian Vike and AUFORN (Australian UFO Network).

Half of Mexican hill disappears HERMOSILLO, Sonora - Luis Gonzalez reports, \"More than half of a hill located on the Hermosillo coast apparently 'vanished' after a UFO was spotted. The event was classified by Sonoran scientists as 'strange and sur- prising' \"According to a series of images taken by EL IMPARCIAL which were classified as 'historically significant,' a hill belonging to the Sierra de Cirios range near Puerto Libertad ceased to exist in a matter of hours. \"At 8:54 AM on Jan. 10,2005, a re- porter and photographer from this newsroom saw what they took to be a UFO as they drove along Route 36 north along the coastline. After this sighting there occurred a strange phe- nomenon in which rocky formations changed composition. \"At 2:08 PM. as shown by photo- graphs taken at the site, a considerable part of the hill had disappeared.\" Translation (c) 2004 by Scott Corrales, Institute of Hispanic Ufology (IHU).

I watched their movement as they generally floated or hovered in the cor- ner. FEBRUARY 2005 \"A third red plasma like disk entered the room and flew towards the bed and hovered over my husband. The red ball with red lights shining down stayed over him for about a minute and then flew outside through the wall. (See drawing at right.) The disk was about one foot in diameter.\" On Jan. 6, 2005, two red plasma- like basketballs again appeared about 2 AM, and Jane was wide awake. \"Then a miniature disc-shaped UFO appeared from the left wall and slowly flew across the room to above my husband's head,\" she reports. \"The disc hovered and eventually flew through the wall. \"The disc was gray and white, and appeared to have windows around its center and a second set circling the bot- tom of the craft. It was two feet in di- ameter and one foot high, and was per- fect in detail. \"Once the craft left, the other red balls departed with it. My husband's health remains good except for a cold.\" Thanks to Jane for her drawings. Note: We have many similar reports of miniature UFOs. Some reports in- dicate the UFOs haver an ability to en- large and miniaturize when needed. Round ball in room in Ohio STRONGSVILLE - Diane writes, \"We spoke a few months ago about the sightings in Olmsted Falls in Septem- ber. I get the feeling that something or someone does not like my telling you anything about this. I have now really seen a UFO several different times, the last one being Dec. 21, 2004, as I was leaving the post office in Strongsville. \"Driving home I saw the lights in the sky, which were very much like our pic- tures that were taken in Olmsted Falls by the police. \"A few days before that, I was sit- ting at my computer and heard a static kind of sound and turned around to see a round ball. It was about the size of a large grapefruit or small melon that looked like the sun-yellow and orangey bright, about 10 inches or so above the floor. \"It moved along the wall across from me in a straight line, doubled back to about the middle of the wall, then dis- appeared-gone just like that.

Oregon object shoots sparks DALLAS - At 7 PM on Jan. 5, 2005, four witnesses saw an object that was shooting sparks from the bottom as it hovered and moved one way then the other. The first witness saw a bright light that would beam up to the sky, and sparks and balls of light that were com- ing from the bottom of the craft! It was moving south, then just shot away fast. Witness 2 saw an orange sphere/cigar standing up, then side- ways, going back and forth, very bright and shooting sparks from the bottom.

Mississippi boomerang UFO BILOXI - The witness was stand- ing outside watching the meteor shower on Dec. 14, 2004, at midnight when a boomerang of lights seemed to appear out of nowhere. It was close to the ground, but made no sound. It turned in different directions rap- idly, then just disappeared. The witness says, \"I live close to Keesler Air Force Base and figured it was probably just a plane, but I could see no outline of a plane, even though it was close to the ground, and I could hear no engines.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Friedman... (Continued from Page 21) USAF General Carroll Bolender's statement (October, 1969) that \"reports of UFOs which could affect National Security are made in accordance with JANAP 146 or Air Force Manual 55- 11 and ARE NOT PART OF THE BLUE BOOK SYSTEM.\" (My em- phasis.) If not Blue Book, then who was do- ing the investigation? Nobody has picked up on the heavily whited out and blacked out NSA and CIA UFO docu- ments. There is a Cosmic Watergate being treated like Alice's Tea Party. The tabloids benefit because they know the public is very interested, and the \"Respectable Media\" shed little light on the UFO topic. They can get away with nonsense, as can a number of specialty TV channels. The History Channel has had several rotten pro- grams on UFOs, and only a few good ones. The SETI Cultists benefit from hav- ing the press lap up their nonsense to the effect that they are doing \"impor- tant\" science, as opposed to the UFO junk. This helps in fund raising. Their \"scientific respectability\" means con- tributions are tax deductible as well. How much support would they be getting if, as is the case, it turned out that aliens are indeed visiting, and that there is no scientific basis for SETI as presently practiced? It would spoil a lot of careers of people who probably dream of passing the torch for the un- scientific search to the next generation. As an aside, research groups con- nected with nuclear fusion for power production have for 50 years been say- ing that we will have fusion power plants in 40 years. The goal never seems to get any closer. But the bud- gets keep on. The ancient academics and fossilized physicists, who often make negative UFO pronouncements, don't need to be bothered with developing a college level course on UFOs or sponsoring theses, though some very few brave souls have done so. No point in wast- ing time on the evidence or admitting they have been wrong, wrong, wrong. The military can keep others in so- ciety from knowing what is going on, or duplicating technology benefits, and keep their budgets going by not having to admit they can't prevent alien over- flights, and that their weapon systems can't compare. They can sponsor highly-classified research using the best detection and communications tools with no com- plaints from the public, which, because of the compliant press, has no idea what they have been doing. As long as the press and the public believe that there is nothing to UFOs, then the intelligence agencies such as the NSA, CIA, NRO, DIA, ONI, OSI etc don't need to expose their UFO activities to criticism from the public or each other. I have found that most people have no idea how large the Intelligence bud- gets are, and that the agencies are rarely accountable even to Congress. The first three have multibillion-dollar highly classified annual budgets. The NRO was around for decades before the pub- lic even became aware of it. A CIA historian published an article about the history of the CIA and UFOs that got wide distribution for the totally wrong notion that most sightings, after the U-2 and SR 71 began flying, were caused by observations of these secret platforms. The data show this is non- sense; there was no increase. Certain fundamentalist religious leaders such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson would be up a religious creek without a paddle if the truth about flying saucers came out, since they in- sist there are no intelligent beings other than on Earth. UFOs represent the work of the devil, they claim. They have cer- tainly had support from people in high places. Sci-Fi stalwarts have persistently attacked UFOs, despite their clear un- willingness to look at the evidence. Obviously, they, for reasons unknown, consider themselves (Asimov, Bova, Clark, etc) experts on alien and Earth- ling behavior, and have labored long and hard to make space travel respect- able. They don't want to be tarred with the kook brush, or admit how they have ignored the evidence. After all, if there were any, they would have known about it. Far out contactees-liars and charla- tans about their supposed UFO expe- riences-also benefit from public ridi- cule, since, if the subject were taken seriously by the media and academia, they would be denied their often prof- itable platforms. The debunkers benefit from lectures and books attacking \"This nonsense.\" Prometheus, a publisher specializing in debunkery, has already published three anti-Roswell books. CSICOP has raised a lot of money to continue their debunkery, with a new facility, income, and prestige from the Skeptical Inquirer. Their income and status would certainly be hurt if they had to admit they had been totally wrong. I am still an optimist. Max Planck, a great physicist, once said that new ideas come to be accepted, not because their opponents come to believe in them, but because their opponents die and a new generation grows up that is accustomed to them. It will happen. Stan Friedman fsphys@rogers.com www.stanfriedman.com 20 MUFON UFO Journal FEBRUARY 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"By Stanton T. Friedman Why still the ridicule? A contributor to an internet discus- sion group was wondering why there is still so much fear of ridicule associated with reporting a UFO sighting, or just dis- cussing the subject. He noted that there is a load of evi- dence from all over the world describ- ing people seeing UFOs from the ground, on the sea, and from the air. The opinion polls seem to show a significant fraction of the public believes that aliens are vis- iting. So why the ridicule, or at least fear of ridicule? He could understand back a half century ago before the space age. I think back to a survey I took in a college classroom after asking the roughly 100 students to vote with their hands, but with their eyes shut so they wouldn't be influenced by the other members of the class. Their instructor and I would tally the results. Turns out that about 80% of the stu- dents thought that most people didn't believe in UFOs, but that 80% of the stu- dents did. My observation would be that as long as most people believe that most others do NOT accept flying saucer re- ality, they will be less likely to report a sighting or discuss it. I have had several instances where a person hadn't even told his or her spouse about a sighting because of fear of ridi- cule. On a more sophisticated level, if the news media and the scientific commu- nity share this notion that most people don't believe in UFOs, they will be less likely to sponsor a thesis about UFOs, less likely to assign reporters to do a se- rious article, less likely to demand that their congressman or news media treat the subject fairly, and less likely to teach a course about UFOs. I think there are a number of reasons why the fear of ridicule is legitimate. There are plenty ready to ridicule. As with crimes, one must ask who benefits? As it happens there are a number of groups which benefit from keeping the FEBRUARY 2005 Stan Friedman' laughter curtain in place. I believe that all the groups I will deal with here honestly believe that if, indeed, some UFOs are alien spacecraft, that would be a very big story, perhaps the biggest of the millenium. However, since they take great pride in their knowl- edge (whether journalistic, sci- entific, or reli- gious) of im- portant stories, they have no reason to ac- cept the idea of alien visits. If the story were true, they would know about it. They don't know anything that would lead them to such a belief, so there is no reason to waste time studying this silly subject. A kind of Catch 22 with ignorance being bliss. The mass media have a great influ- ence on public beliefs, which are highly dependent on the manner of presenta- tion. After all, there was a time in the re- cent past where I am sure most Ameri- cans believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, was directly connected with the 9/11 events, and was a clear and present danger to the rest of the world in general, and the US in particu- lar. I am sure that some few people still believe these notions despite the absence of evidence. They have been brain- washed. When it comes to UFOs, the major news media have been derelict in their responsibility to the public. They don't make any effort to have reporters be- come knowledgeable, or to find people who are knowledgeable. They will blindly accept the \"explanations\" pro- vided by the rent-a-debunker groups or the ignorant astronomy department MUFON UFO JOURNAL spokesmen. It took a lot of people work- ing with Woodward and Bernstein to blow the lid off the political Watergate, but neither the NY Times nor Washing- ton Post has spent a reasonable effort to get at the truth about UFOs, despite the facts and the importance. William Broad is a Pulitzer Prize-win- ning writer for the NY Times. Yet he es- sentially bought the USAF nonsense about Project Mogul explaining Roswell. He had written an important article on nuclear explosions which had not been publicly announced, so he knows there are cover-ups, but blindly accepted the baloney about Project Mogul with- out even bothering to talk to any people connected with Roswell, despite their ready availability through the Interna- tional UFO Museum and Research Cen- ter in Roswell. His 60-column-inch article started in the upper left hand quadrant of the front page of the Sunday Times, one of the best possible locations for news or pro- paganda, and was carried by other pa- pers. Are there benefits from maintaining the laughter curtain? Surprisingly, there are a number of groups that benefit. The press benefits by not having to spend any effort to become knowledge- able, by not having to admit they missed such a big story of far out technology and government cover-up, and by not having to admit they had ridiculed \"be- lievers\" and witnesses. TIME Magazine, a supposed bastion of respectability, published a cover story on Roswell which became their biggest seller that year (1997, Roswell SOthAnniversary) until Princess Di died. They were certainly not concerned about accuracy. I have noted cover stories by Popu- lar Mechanics and Sceptic that were very short on accuracy and very long on sensationalism. I don't know of any, for example, that have followed up on (Continued on Page 20) 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Director's Message CALENDAR worked with a Frontier Airlines pilot to investigate the experiences of Viet- nam era Air Force veteran Charles James Hall when he was working at a highly classified area in Nevada.
