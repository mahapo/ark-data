John Keel, internationally known UFO writer, who has also contributed articlas to SKY LOOK. Mr. Keel is a former script writer for radio and TV prograns, but is now devoting the majority of his tim 'to the study and research of the UFO phenomena. This exte~isive study and the inform~~tion he has bekn abie to fere-t out through intense ef ~ort is the ingredients for ;lis ~agazine articles, newspaper colu~~s and books. Ee has ai~p~ared on mcmg TV and radio interview programs in the past, but has now ckt thcsc to a minimum due to insufficient time to develop a clcar understanding of the subject for the listeners in the allotcd program time. He has been a regular contributor to magazines such as SAGA, TRUE, MALE and FATE professionally, while a-t the same time creating further exposure in UP0 publications such as FLYIliG SAUCER KEVIEW and SliYLOOK. Plr. Keel has just conpletcd wrltmg a new book that is now at the publishers and which deals with the \"abominable snowman\" type of crea- tures with long hclir and unplezsai~t odor that are said to hve frequent- ed all parts of the United St3.tes dad some forclgn countries.

He has dcveloped his own personal Data Reduction System that he hopes will be adopted universally in cataloging UFO rei)orts. Mr. Keel has b(;en a writer on a profcsslonal basis all his life, and is capable of writing z book in eight d2.y~. He is a spr2cd reader and can read four books a day when clonducting research. His person- ality and deep interest in people enables him to win their confidence during UFO investigation. Through his interviewing technique, he has been able to solicit significant details from the obscrver that most people would miss. While many of the readers of SKYLOOK have been studying UFO's from the scientific point of view, and could possibly have accepted the extra-terrestrial hypothesis as the most likoly explanation of the origin of UFO's, PIr.

Hertell, Field Investigator, AYRO Following are a few comments I would like to express in regard to the Major Richmond sighting which was reported in detail in the pre- , vious issue of SKYLOOK. As reported, the story of'the sighting is not MY story, but I%jor Richmond's. Therefor, the \"'different view\" expressed is not IU view but Major R ichmond ' , . A good ,investigator. sticks to the \"facts\" and arrives at his con- clusions based upon those facts which his investig~tion discloses. The point is that the c ~nclusions drawn in this case are the only log- ical conclusions thdt cdn be reached based upon the facts as given to the investigator by the witness, Now, there are three basic reasons why this sighting report may seem to be in conflict with other reports of the 'Lsame\" phenomena on the same date: - 1. The witness could be lying. 2. The witness could be in error. 3 The witness could have seen a different object than that reported by the other observers, There is no reason whatsoever to be-lieve number one; number two could be partially true; number three could very well be true. I would like all your readers also to consider two truths that I have learned after 4,200 hours flying Wne as a pilot and many years as an investigator: 1. Objects may appear quite different when observed from the ground at great distances as compared to when observed while in the air from close proximity, 2. It is exceedingly difficult to accurately estimte the actual size or speed of an object either whiie stand-ing on the ground looking ug many miles away or in the air at very high altitude, (Slgned ) dobert J. Eertell Pield Investigator BPKO P,S, The speed of the object was 692 to 807 miles pr hour, not 200 to 700, .as reported in SULOOK.
