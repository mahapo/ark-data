The physics of crop formations By John A. Burke Editor's Note: Last month Nancy Talbott discussed some of the specific analyses of physical trace cases conducted by the BLT research team of John Burke, W. C. Levengood, and Talbott, as well as possible links between crop circles, UFOs, and animal mutilation cases. This month Burke dis- cusses the force he feels may be involved in creat- ing the crop circles. In 1989 the appearance of two books on crop circles, combined with some media coverage, alerted most Americans for the first time to the appearance of a previously unrecognized phenomena which had no precedent: large, geometric-shaped areas of crop which had been flattened overnight. Writing a letter to author Pat Delgado to ask for details on the biological studies, career biophysi- cist Dr. W. C. Levengood was shocked to find that no biological studies were being conducted. He asked for and received plant samples taken in line with his in- structions in what was to become a steady stream of plants across the Atlantic. As formations were reported in the U.S. and other countries, samples were obtained from them as well-always with control samples taken from unaffected parts of the same field for compari- son. Today, after meticulously analyzing tissue samples from five countries and more than 300 formations in- volving many types of crops, some clear patterns have emerged. Whatever the force which makes crop forma- tions, it physically alters the tissue of the flattened plants in a number of ways. Over time an hypothesis has emerged suggesting plasma as the active force. None of the following effects has occurred when formations have been made (by us and others) using all the tech- niques claimed by those who have \"confessed\" to hoax- ing the crop formations: OStalks which are very often bent up to ninety degrees without being broken, particularly at the nodes, which are like the joints of wheat stems. Something softened the plant tissue at the moment of flattening. This is particularly dramatic in canola (rapeseed), which otherwise is as stiff as celery at this stage of develop- ment. ©Stalks which are usually enlarged, stretched from the inside out by something which seems to heat the nodes from the inside. Sometimes this effect is so powerful, the node literally explodes from the inside out, blowing holes in the node walls and spewing sap outside the stalk. This has been measured in thousands of samples to a degree of 95% to 99% probability (\"sig- This formation was discovered near Wiltshire, England, in a wheat field in July of 1997. It fea- tures a border of 126 small circles and a width of 350 feet. (Photo by Steve Alexander © 1997.) nificant\" to \"highly significant,\" in the language of sci- ence). Dr. Levengood has duplicated this effect using microwaves. ©Stalks which are left with surface electric charge. We have measured this in two formations which were only a few hours old. The degree to which the stalks were bent over was proportional to the degree of electric charge on the stalk, strongly suggesting the force which pushed it over was electrical. OThe thin bract tissue surrounding wheat seed which has had its electrical conductivity increased, con- sistent with exposure to an electrical charge. Natural causes? As scientists we had to next ask if there is any- thing in nature which shares these characteristics. The answer is yes-plasma. Plasma here is simply electri- fied air. It carries electric charge, and when it travels through a magnetic field (like the geomagnetic field which exists everywhere on the planet) it does two things: 1.) It moves in a spiral, the most common pat- tern in which crop is flattened. 2.) When it spirals thus it emits microwaves. This is the same principle used in your micro- wave oven, where electrons are spun around a magnet in the roof and emit the microwaves which penetrate the tissue and heat from the inside by interacting with the water in the food. The nodes, the most affected part of crop formation samples, are the site with most of the plant's water. Plasma was first hypothesized as the cause of crop formations by English meteorologist Terence Meaden. He suggested the plasma was in the form of a vortex produced meteorologically. Unfortunately crop"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 October 1998 MUFON UFO Journal formations did not seem overly dependent on any set of weather conditions, and the model did not explain non-circular formations. We asked ourselves, was there any other pos- sible source for plasma? Lightning is an example of a very powerful, very high energy plasma. It is caused by plasma (electrically charged air) far above ground in thunderheads up to eight miles high being attracted to opposite charges in the ground. But lightning is a much higher energy plasma than that which makes crop circles (where no charring occurs). Low energy plasma The ionosphere, on the other hand, is a region of low energy plasma 40-80 miles up in our atmosphere, where most of the air is electrified by solar wind and cosmic rays. The only time that some of this plasma gets energetic enough to glow is when we see the North- ern Lights. It was long believed that the ionosphere and the earth's surface were completely separate, and that never the twain would meet. In recent years, de- cades of airline pilot sightings were confirmed with scientists' photos of electrical flashes in the air between thunderheads (8 miles high) and the ionosphere (up to 100 miles high). The several types of these have been dubbed \"sprites.\" These are apparently very common events. So there are frequent exchanges of electric cargo between the ionosphere and a storm 90 percent of the way to the earth's surface. We believe that sometimes the exchange may cover the other 10 percent of the distance as well and actually reach the ground. Something similar is known to happen every night everywhere when plasma pen- etrates part way down (causing perturbations in the geomagnetic field). Normally these attempted penetra- tions are bounced back the way they came by the re- flective layers of the ionosphere. These are the same reflective layers which AM radio waves bounce off to communicate over the horizon. At night these layers weaken and rise (which is why you can get AM radio reception much further away late at night). They are weakest in the predawn hours, when most crop formations occur. The ability of plasma to penetrate these reflective layers is directly proportional to its \"vorticity\"; i.e. the tighter and faster spinning the plasma cloud, the further it can penetrate toward the ground. The \"magnetic pinch\" effect insures that as such a plasmoid descends toward the surface, it shrinks in size and spins faster (much like spinning figure skat- ers accelerate by pulling in their arms). An increase in \"ammunition\" The amount of \"ammunition\" in the ionosphere, in the form of free electrons, increases up to 100 times between sunspbt maximum and sunspot minimum. Crop formation frequency, at least in England, has roughly paralleled sunspot numbers. The huge out- breaks of 1988-1989 coincided with the most power- ful sunspot maximum in their 170 years of recorded history, and have declined accordingly since. This roughly eleven-year cycle should peak again near the millennium. The meteoritic connection The strongest evidence for the ionosphere as the origin of crop formation plasma comes from mi- croscopic particles of meteoritic dust found in 2/3 of the 32 formations where we have been able to obtain soil samples. The heaviest concentration ever was found in 1993 in an English formation which appeared on the night of the largest meteor shower to hit Europe in 30 years. This example became the basis of the sec- ond paper we have have managed to publish on crop circles in a peer-reviewed paper (Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 9, pp. 191-199, 1995). Sub-millimeter-sized bubbles of pure iron ox- ide (magnetite) coated both the ground and the crop in that formation. To summarize a detailed and technical investigation, the material was identical to the debris which erodes from meteors as they burn up in the at- mosphere, and which takes 7-10 days to settle to the ground. It can be picked up with a magnet (as could some of the wheat in which it had become imbedded). It has since appeared in the majority of formations from 13 states and 5 countries where soil samples were ob- tained. Inside formations, it appears in 20 to 100 times the normal concentration for soil. As plasma spirals around geomagnetic field lines it creates its own magnetic field. This would tend to attract and carry along any magnetite dust particles encountered as it descended from the ionosphere. The ubiquitous presence of this material has essentially ruled out a low altitude source for the plasma. Established scientific facts These are extremely well-established and long-established scientific facts. Nothing said so far is remotely controversial, except for the idea of plasma reaching the ground from the ionosphere. Plasma loves to organize itself into spirals. Most aurora are actually arrays of tight tubes of plasma vortices seen from the side as they spin around the geomagnetic field lines. One third of all aurora organize themselves into gross spirals as well. One candidate-the small curl-seems a likely candidate for crop circle formation. It is often as small as 400 meters across where it starts in the iono- sphere, but shrinks as it descends. Plasma might, we reasoned, be reaching the wheat fields of England from the ionosphere, but why did so many occur in one small area of England-and how did they form some of those incredible patterns? These are two very distinct issues. In a search for why"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1998 PageS This \"sine/co-sine\" formation was discovered at Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England, in June of 1996. It features 89 circles and a length of 648 feet. (Photo by Steve Alexander © 1997) any plasma might be particularly attracted to one tiny area 30 miles or so across, we eventually looked at hydro-geological maps of England and found some- thing remarkable. Crop formations in England overwhelmingly appear over shallowly-buried parts of a giant chalk aquifer. England has the world's deepest chalk aqui- fer. (The white cliffs of Dover are a view of one side of it.) They also have some of the world's greatest sea- sonal fluctuations of water levels-up to 100 feet. Was there anything about this which might attract plasma? As it turned out, there was. Water percolating through porous rock-any kind of porous rock-creates electric charge. This occurs by a process called \"adsorption,\" where electrons are stripped off water droplets as they move through rock pores, leaving a net negative elec- tric charge behind on the rock and a net positive charge on the water which drains through. Chemical reinforcement With calcium carbonate (the mineral which makes up chalk) there is a chemical process when the water dissolves some of the mineral, which further re- inforces this same charge separation. Wherever charge separation occurs in a body which can conduct elec- tricity, electric current flows and generates its own magnetic fields. We measured these ground currents and their changing magnetic fields in 1993 at Silbury Hill, long the center of the most intense crop formation activity in the world. Relationship with aquifer Crop formations in southern England over- whelmingly occur where this electrically-charged rock is closest to the surface. The largest formations and most frequent formations happen late in the summer when the aquifer is most run down, and the most water has therefore run through the most rock. The begin- ning of the modern phenomenon of large, spectacular formations begins in the late seventies and early eight- ies, a time when over-pumping for public water sup- plies began to lower the water table noticeably. Droughts have coincided with banner years for crop formations. In England, our team has measured the kind of magnetic fields one would expect to accompany such electric ground currents in one field that has nearly annual formations. Four days later a major formation occurred there. Follow-up fluxgate magnetometer mea- surements four days after this sixty-foot dumbbell for- mation appeared showed that the magnetic readings and the currents which produced them had vanished. This is not unlike the discharge with that more power- ful plasma-lightning. In that case ground current at-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 October 1998 MUFON UFO Journal tracts the airborne plasma, and when the plasma (the bolt) hits the surface it neutralizes the ground current. Limestone is the chemical twin of chalk. It too is calcium carbonate, but much less porous than chalk. It too has the ability to generate ground currents from interaction with water, but not nearly so much as chalk. Thus it is fascinating to note that limestone aquifers are the major exception to crop formations occurring over chalk substrata. Formations in England do hap- pen a minority of the time on the large limestone aqui- fers there. In the U.S. we have no substantial chalk de- posits, but huge stretches of limestone aquifers: in Florida, on the Eastern Coastal Plain, throughout much of the Midwest, and virtually all of the Great Plains, extending into Canada. Finally a thin stretch runs down the West Coast. These locations are where crop for- mations occur. As in England, the most active sites seem to frequently be where an edge of the aquifer occurs or where a river valley has cut through the aqui- fer to produce an edge. Proximity to water to also typi- cal (no surprise considering the current generated be- tween water and the rock it ran through). Shape most difficult to explain This leaves us with the question of shape-the most difficult aspect to explain with a natural model of crop formations. The most common patterns in the crops are the most common patterns seen in plasma in the laboratory. It is important to remember that plasma is scale invariant; anything which happens on a scale of inches can and will happen on a scale of miles, etc. So it is worth noting that plasma in the lab most com- monly organizes itself into a spiral-the most common pattern of flattened crop. Next most common in plasma is the swirled disc surrounded by concentric rings (the \"bulls-eye\" or \"target\" pattern). This is also the next most common in the fields. Furthermore, in both medi- ums the concentric rings tend to alternately swirl clock- wise and counterclockwise as you move out from the center (or in from the edge). Other patterns Other patterns seen in plasma and crops in- clude floral patterns, nested crescents, dumbbells, and others. The hardest to understand using the plasma model, are straight lines and right angle shapes. It is counterintuitive to think that air can form such pat- terns. However, as electrified air, plasma behaves more like an electromagnetic fluid (and so the physics of plasma motion is \"magnetohydrodynamics\") While it is also contrary to common sense that liquids form such shapes, in fact they do-when excited. American physi- cists exciting liquids with sound waves have produced surface ripple patterns that include squares, triangles, hexagons, and others. We must remember that a crop formation is the two-dimensional record of the passing of a likely three dimensional shape. The ground (2D) is likely to record only a 2D slice of a 3D plasmoid. So even 2D patterns in the plasma could got recorded on the ground. Deterministic chaos Deterministic chaos is a new branch of science which has repeatedly shown that systems which are excited or turbulent can assume surprisingly geomet- ric patterns. Ilya Prigogine received the Nobel Prize for showing that 2D geometric patterns often form of their own accord in 3D pools of liquid chemical re- agents. A ball of plasma being drawn groundward by an electromagnetic hot spot is likely a turbulent sys- tem. As such we can expect that patterns will sponta- neously arise, however briefly. If that is the moment at which the plasma impacts the ground, that is the pat- tern we can expect to appear in the crop. However, with plasma there is a positive feedback loop which might tend to refine certain patterns until they are of the picture-perfect sort we so often encounter. Certain shapes called waveguides will attract plasma likes bees to honey. A rectangle is one such shape and is a primary reason why ball lightning (a high energy plasma) loves to enter nouses through the chimney. Chimneys are rectangular tunnels. Another commonly-used waveguide in industry is the dumb- bell shape (which happens frequently in the fields.) Still another is the \"key\" or \"F\" shape we often see attached to circles (called the Millman Waveguide). Plasmas create their own magnetic field lines. If, by random chance, the magnetic field in a turbulent plasma takes on a waveguide shape, it could create a positive feedback loop. More plasma will be attracted to that part of the plasma ball, vortex, or cloud which has assumed that shape. The plasma will spiral along those magnetic field lines as it moves. When plasma spirals around a magnetic field line it strengthens that field line, which can now in turn attract more plasma, etc. Thus this shape might tend to get \"locked in\" and even refined until close to its ideal shape. At the mo- ment this is a highly speculative but stimulating hy- pothesis. It still strains the imagination to think how some of the more elaborate patterns might arise from sheer plasma physics. Not always perfect One aspect of all this that has long bothered us was that if this is a natural phenomenon, then it should frequently not come out geometric at all. Nature does not always get everything perfect. As it turns out, we now believe that most plasma impacts result in non geometric flattening of the crop. Of course, crops around the world are constantly being flattened by"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1998 Page? non-plasma events like wind. However, sometimes close inspection of such ragged downed areas reveals the same bent nodes as in formations. Sometimes a large field which gets flattened in a non-descript pat- tern will have within it small areas of spiraled lay and other lay patterns (with 180 degree opposition) impos- sible if wind was the cause. Same tissue changes Sampling and lab analysis of many such sites has shown a great number to have the same tissue changes as in formations. In fact the most dramatic node changes ever recorded have been in such ragged downed areas-including nodes which were blown apart from the internal pressure. This is in keeping with plasma physics. Plasma will spontaneously organize itself into a vortex shape-if the energy level of the plasma does not get too high. When the energy level exceeds a certain threshold, the plasma's ability to maintain the vortex pattern breaks down. Examination of photos of crop formations very often shows such ragged areas of downed crop all around the formation. Our pattern-seeking minds, however, ignore this, and we go straight to the geometric formation, considering this to be the only \"genuine\" event in the field. We believe that plasma, in whatever shape, is probably impacting the ground far more often than we realize. We have analyzed rings in grass which have undergone physical changes consistent with plasma contact. If plasma were to hit streets or buildings it would leave no visible record. A series of concentric rings found in sand on a beach showed very high lev- els of ionization. A circle in dirt in a Colorado field had some of the highest concentrations of meteoritic dust we have ever seen-only in the top three inches of ground and only inside the circle. Like sprites? We believe that the plasma we are studying may turn out to be like sprites. Their existence, re- ported for decades by airline pilots, was ignored by science until a professional scientist took photographs of them. Now that scientists are looking, they are dis- covering sprites to be incredibly common wherever there are thunderstorms. We have one daytime photo which looks like a small plasma vortex, and the rare eyewitness accounts of circle formation are consistent with our model. Likely one day everyone will know of such events. In the meantime we have those amazing patterns to admire and puzzle over. (The author can be contacted at 20 Cyrus Pt. La., Bayville, NY 11709. Tel: 516-628-3291 FAX: 516-628-0447) What about those 'creatures' reported around the world? By Cynthia Luce Editor's Note: The author and Bob Pratt re- ported on the Varginha, Brazil, ET case in the Au- gust and September issues. This article grew out of that investigtion. Readers may also recall the \"crea- ture\" involvement in an Iowa case re- ported by Beverly Trout in the Au- gust Journal. Has anyone seen an animal or \"creature\" that isn't \"ours\"-that is, on the edge of reality? It can be a huge strangely intelligent predatory bird, or an out-sized black, furry dog-like crea- ture, or a \"mammal\" -a human-animal combo-or an even more bizarre mix- ture of human, reptile, animal, fish etc. I ask this question because there is an almost ignored process going on. The creatures seen in Varginha may not be as unusual as they seem. The events clustered around Jan. 20, 1996, in Varginha jolted me into taking a closer look at some of my own data as well as other half-forgotten references to anoma- lous creatures that have been recorded since the dawn of history. And recently researchers have noted a link between UFOs and the appearance of these beasts. In the fever to get at the facts surrounding the discovery and handling of the strange ETs in Varginha, the appearance of several other odd creatures has been more or less brushed aside. This may be a mistake. Maybe the time span of what we've designated as a cluster of events should be expanded. What I'm arguing for here is a closer look by UFO witnesses at the possibility that an anomalous creature could make an appearance and be linked to the perception of the UFO phenomenon, either before, during, or after the UFO sighting. And researchers should not only pay more attention to the possibilities of links between UFOs and anomalous phenomena, but look for links in wider time spans. In Varginha, besides the famous lumpy-headed"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS October 1998 MUFON UFO Journal \"ETs\" that sent ripples around the world, there were encounters with other strange creatures and UFO sightings both before and after Jan. 20, 1996. Besides the already noted supposed UFO crash observed by Carlos de Souza on Jan. 13, a man named Antonio Morais saw a bipedal, big-headed, furry creature in Alfenas, 37 miles west of Varginha: This was largely ignored by the researchers at the time, possibly be- cause it didn't seem to be related to the captured Varginha ETs. Zoo restaurant encounter We've already mentionedTeresinha Clepf's en- counter with a being on April 21 at the zoo restaurant, plus a biology student's May 15 sighting of a creature starting to cross a highway near where Oralina and Eurico saw the UFO in January. But for some reason people cut off at that point and forget about Luciano Olimpio do Reis being the victim of an attack at the end of May. Luciano was walking home late one night on a road in Passes, 115 miles west of Varginha, when a hairy, bipedal creature allegedly emerged from trees beside the road and attacked him. Luciano, then 19, is well built and about 6 foot 3. He said the creature was about 5 foot 5. \"It jumped on top of me, making a sort of growl that I've never heard from any animal, and I can't imi- tate,\" Luciano told investigators. \"First it ripped my jacket and shirt with claws, sharp like a cat's. I fell backwards on the ground. But falling I gave (the crea- ture) a kick in the chest, which unbalanced him, and he fell back. I got up and ran, with the creature after me, and he knocked me down again. He jumped on top of me. I kicked him again, in the groin, and, while he was gasping (on the ground), I got up and ran.\" Three similar cases When Ubirajara and Pacaccini investigated, they found three other cases of similar attacks by what Luciano insists was a \"werewolf.\" There are many such incidents of strange creatures seen in areas of UFO sightings, both in Brazil and elsewhere in the world. I want to cite several cases I know personally. In my own backyard in 1972, my neighbor Joao Carvalho, his wife Marcia, and daughter Aparecida, then 8, experienced two events within a month. First Joao and his daughter were in the yard of their moun- tain-top home where a \"ball of light\" (which I also have seen) regularly passes close to the ground. But on this moonlit summer night, they suddenly saw a sil- very UFO pass by quite close to them. It was about 5 feet in diameter and shaped like two soup plates. On another moonlit evening a month later, Joao and his wife and daughter were strolling along an old bullock cart road high above the valley. They looked down into a rocky stream bed and saw a most peculiar animal. At first they thought it was a big dog, but it was just too big and too odd. In this area we have many wild ani- mals but they're all small-armadillo, sloths, loboquara (a wild dog like a fox), and a cat, plus coatis and spot- ted cavies and a variety of capybara-nothing like what the Carvalhos were seeing, which was a black, fuzzy dog-like animal the size of a pony! In 1997, Chupacabras, first reported in Puerto Rico and later throughout much of the western hemi- sphere, appeared in many parts of Brazil, sometimes during periods of UFO sightings, sometimes not. Chupacabra attacks on domestic animals-chickens, ducks and geese, sheep, cattle, dogs and cats and more- were reported in Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Petropolis, and elsewhere. There were so many that Chupacabras became the subject matter of popular songs and dirty jokes. A classic pattern Some of these attacks occurred almost in my back yard, in Petropolis, a city of more than a million inhabitants 60 miles away. Between July 11 and July 15, 11 of the 14 geese of one small businessman were killed in the classic pattern of animal mutilations: small holes (in this case a 2-cm hole on the neck) through which all the blood and/or organs were extracted. In the first attack, two geese were killed, in the second, nine. All were found dead inside a wire pen with the gate closed. UFOs were seen during this period. On the night of July 13, a Petropolis family I've known for a long time-Genaro Faraco, his wife Lloyd, and daughter Joanna-were in their apartment when they saw a UFO quite low in the sky and huge. Petropolis is a place of frequent sightings and this was not the first time the Faraco family had seen UFOs. I have many unpublished cases from this region and two friends, both with military connections, have told me that CINDACTA (the nation's air traffic control sys- tem) regularly picks up UFOs on their radar screens. A link to UFOs? To many, these attempts to link UFOs and strange phenomena might seem tenuous in the extreme until one examines cases where people have actually witnessed the two together, as mentioned in Jerome Clark's book Creatures of the Goblin World. Clark cites various cases with a UFO-creature link. Below are several. A family in Ohio (1969) saw a UFO and occu- pant one morning and also reported seeing a huge cat-like creature which came close and sat in their drive- way. The three-inch paw prints were far too big to be- long to any animal in that area, and the panther, cou- gar, and mountain lion had long been gone from the area. This family also saw another large erect creature in the nearby woods, standing and watching their house."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1998 Page 9 On Sept. 9, 1973, in Savannah, GA, \"several youths reported seeing 10 big, black, hairy dogs\" come out of a UFO and run through the cemetery and disap- pear. And in another \"Manimal-UFO case (1973-- J. Clark, pg. 56), a man fishing had an encounter with a sandy-colored anthropoidal creature. After actually touching him, the manimal ran away with amazing speed. Its disappearance was followed by a \"glowing bronze object\" shooting out of the trees and fading rap- idly into the sky. The witness, Jeff Martin, searched the next day and found nothing. He returned that night with his fiancee and her father plus two friends. All the way there they were trailed by a \"white, glowing star-like light.\" The light disappeared near a bridge where Martin had seen the manimal, and when they reached that point, there was the creature! It was eight to nine feet tall and was standing in tall weeds, giving off a \"musty\" odor. Other accounts Other more recent accounts of odd animals and UFOs are noted in Virgilio Sanchez-Ocejo's book Mi- ami Chupacabras. This book discusses various cases both in Miami and Puerto Rico. Virgilio describes a range of incidents involving animal mutilations, and in one case in Miami a Mrs. Teide Carballo, whose goats and hens were killed in two events, actually saw a manimal. She described it as being like a monkey, but walking upright, though hunched over with a gorilla-like gait. At the same time (March 1996), in another part of the city, a Mr. Felix Outra's chickens were killed. The footprints in both places were similar. On two oc- casions-the time closest to the attack being one week before-several people who live in the same house saw an intermittent orange light and heard a thunderous noise above the house, as if the house had collapsed or something was trying to land on top of it. The incidence of UFOs and strange creatures being seen in areas of animal mutilation in Puerto Rico are many, and space does not allow for discussing them. But this subject, with so much data in so many places and over such a long time, needs further research and discussion. Conclusion At this point, it is difficult to present a case that stands up under scientific scrutiny, not only be- cause of the usual scientific overkill where anomalous phenomena are concerned, but also because it seems obvious that the researchers themselves should look at larger time spans, both for odd creature phenomena that appear in areas of UFO sightings, and conversely, for UFO sightings in any region where off-world crea- tures have been seen or inferred. We have to broaden our focus. Jeff Sainio Three indications of a hoax Analysis of Mexico City video By Jeff Sainio MUFON staff video analyst A video of a wobbling disk hovering over Mexico City on Aug. 6,1997, has generated much con- troversy and flooded the Internet with shots of the sau- cer. Opinions of the UFO's validity have ranged from \"best evidence of alien pres- ence\" to \"falling down laugh- ing fake,\" but little hard analysis has supported these conclusions. I am a firm be- liever in Lord Kelvin's com- ment that \"when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge of it is of a mea- gre and unsatisfactory kind.\" Using machine-recognition measurement techniques in- volving no human bias, I found three indications that the video is a fake requiring thousands of measure- ments by the faker to create, but still not satisfying Kelvin enough to avoid detection. These indications are: shakiness of the camera causes smearing of the image-except the UFO, which is always clear and sharp; rotation of the camera causes the view to spin-except the UFO, which remains level (the wobble of the UFO makes this difficult to notice); and the \"hove-ing\" of the UFO isn't quite perfect. Instead, the UFO altitude varies, depending on the bouncing of the camera. Imagine taping a 747 on takeoff and crashing it by shaking the camcorder. Absurd? This video shows the same effect. Original quite bouncy The original video is quite bouncy, typical of a hand-held shot. This makes analysis difficult, unless one is able to measure the bounciness and compensate for it. My custom software \"freezes\" the terrain, so the resultant video appears to be from a tripod-mounted camera. Subtle features are then easier to spot. The illustration shows both stable and bouncy contrast-enhanced images (l/20th second apart in time). Note that in the lower bouncy image, the windows, terraces, and building edges are poorly defined due to the skakiness of the camera. In the upper stable image, all these features are more clearly focused. But in both images the UFO is equally sharp in focus. The gradi- ent lines show that the bouncy buildings' edges require 4 video lines to traverse from light to dark; only 2 lines"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 October 1998 MUFON UFO Journal are needed to make the transition in the stable image. This problem is seen through the entire video; the UFO image is always sharp regardless of the camera bounce. This indicates the UFO wasn't in the video when the camera was shaking, but was added later. Altitude changes The illustration also shows that the UFO alti- tude changes as the camera bounces. The effect is not large; at most, it is about hajf the thickness of the UFO. The \"hovering\" UFO is seen to bounce slightly. Note that in the lower image the UFO is slightly higher above the reference line over to the building ledge. After a few false starts, I finally determined that the UFO bounce matches, with 72% reliability, the velocity of the camera shakiness. (The remaining 28% appears to be inaccurate measurement by the faker who pasted the UFO into the scene.) If the camera shake makes the scene move downward, the UFO altitude increases, and vice versa. The faster the camera is moving up- ward, the lower the UFO altitude. One could think this might be due to chance, and such a possibility can never be eliminated. But the possibility of this occurring ran- domly is about one in ten trillion trillion trillion tril- lion. Yes, worse than winning the PowerBall lottery four weeks in a row. This problem is what would be expected if the UFO were pasted into the video, but I/ 150 second late. The camera not only bounces, but also rotates slightly. Rotation is most obvious when the UFO passes over the second windsock atop the buildings. The ro- tation is not large, only 1.6 degrees at maximum. Since the UFO wobbles about seven degrees, the camera ro- tation has no obvious effect on the UFO wobble. But by removing the periodic component of the UFO wobble, the UFO can be seen to NOT rotate with the rest of the scene. Also at this point, the UFO will be seen to \"dip\" in altitude, getting closer to the windsock below it. Both problems expected Both of these problems are expected if the faker used the first windsock to measure the camera bounce. Since switching reference windsocks involves some"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1998 Page 11 tedious calculations, a reference point is often used as long as possible until it leaves the field of view. So these problems are expected for a lazy faker. A chance wobble? Did, by chance, the UFO happen to wobble at the same time the camera did, to create this effect by coincidence? The chances of this are about seven in a million. Better than PowerBall, but still poor odds. Given the noise inherent in video, what is the chance that this video is real, and that the problems are due to the imperfect nature of video? Imagine the whole So- lar System packed solid with valid videotapes in every direction, a million times further than the orbit of Pluto. You would have to analyze all these videos to find one having these problems by coincidence. These charac- teristics show that the video is the result of an other- wise-real video shot as seen, but with the UFO added later. A \"paste on lighter\" command is used to add the UFO, so it is added to the lighter skies but disappears \"behind\" the darker buildings. Using this command, I easily put a whole armada of UFOs \"behind\" build- ings. Why did a fake contain these errors? Smearing the UFO image takes some work, and since the smear- ing is barely obvious, the faker apparently decided not to do the extra work (or simply didn't know of the problem). Perhaps the faker's software doesn't sup- port this detail, or perhaps the UFO's small size and relatively poor contrast were designed to masquerade the problem. Incredibly tedious To add the UFO image to the video, the faker had to measure the position of some reference point, 60 times in every second of the video. (About a thou- sand pairs of measurements total.) This is incredibly tedious unless one has software to automatically rec- ognize image position and rotation. (I wrote custom software to make these measurements; it is not pub- licly available.) To correct for rotation, one must mea- sure TWO points, not one. For such slight rotation, the faker probably didn't think the error would be noticed. Perhaps the UFO wobble was added to disguise the fact that the UFO didn't rotate with the rest of the im- age. The UFO altitude problem is what is expected if the tedious camera-bounce measurements were smoothed or averaged in a non-symmetrical way. (Ask your statistician if you don't understand this; expect a long-winded reply.) This video gives a good example of rules that good investigators should follow: 1. Be suspicious of anonymous reports. 2. Note oddities in the case; here, a daylight sight- ing of a huge craft in one of the most crowded cities in the world, but no witnesses until after televising the video. 3. \"Expert's\" opinions are meaningless unless they can give repeatable, measurable procedures by which they reached their opinions.

Looking up, a husband, wife, their three-year old child, and the grandmother spotted \"a slow, hovering, metallic, shiny sphere about seven feet above a cherry tree.\" As the UFO hovered and hummed, the man ran indoors to get his camcorder. He switched it on and \"shot two minutes of videotape, showing the departure of the object.\" The family then telephoned the French police. The officers took the videotape, con- tacted SEPRA, the French government agency devoted to UFO research, and reportedly advised the witnesses \"not to speak to any ufologists about the incident.\" Two investigators from the SEPRA office in Toulouse spent two days investigating the encounter. They took burned branches from the cherry tree for lab analysis. In a brief statement, SEPRA said the videotape was \"very interesting\" and \"useable\" in terms of further UFO research. Jean-Jacques Velasco of CNES said the UFO \"looks as if it is floating and then moves away in a curious way.\" He described the object as a round disc, about 5 meters (16.5 feet) across with a few pro- tuberances and a red ring around its bottom.\" Thanks (Continued on Page 19)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 October 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Lasers and the 'Phoenix Lights' By David Rapp It has been over a year since the March 13, 1997 sightings by Arizona residents of a mysterious V-shaped formation of lights that traveled across their state. The origin of these luminous objects, nicknamed the \"Phoenix Lights,\" has undergone endless debate, largely to no conclusion. As a field investigator of UFOs and a person interested in the technical aspects of such events, I naturally followed some of the forthcoming explanations. The subject of this writing is not intended to necessarily lend support to what these lights were, but rather what they were not. I would now like to share with you the results of a personal investigation I conducted regarding one of the so-called causes of the \"Phoenix Lights.\" Like many UFO researchers, I frequently lis- ten to Art Bell, who hosts the syndicated radio talk show programs \"Coast to Coast\" and \"Dreamland.\" On Sept. 18, 1997, Art's guest was Ed Dames, who addressed the topic of the \"Phoenix Lights.\" Dames comes from a military background where he served the Army as an intelligence officer, analyzing Soviet weapons projects. Later, at his request, Dames was assigned to the remote viewing unit at Fort Meade as a remote viewing monitor and analyst, training under Ingo Swann. He retired a major and went on to form his own remote viewing company, Psi-Tech. A hoax using lasers? During the interview, Dames stated that he and others at Psi-Tech had determined through remote view- ing that these lights were the result of a hoax, created artificially through the use of lasers. I was outraged at his incorrect and misleading explanations, especially since Dames claims that his company provides near 100% accuracy in its work. Anyone making such claims, if proven wrong once, could be wrong again-a significant point considering he has provided many of these \"100% correct answers\" regarding past, present, and future UFO events. I set out to make my voice heard by sending emails and faxes to both Ed Dames and Art Bell. There was no response from either person. While the circu- lation of this article may not have an audience the size of \"Coast to Coast\" listeners, at least some of Ed Dames' followers will be enlightened. Lets begin by reviewing some of the key ob- servations of the light formations that were seen to fly over Arizona that night in March 1997. It is generally recognized there were two distinct sets of events. The first sightings occurred between 8:15 p.m. and 8:45 p.m.; the second after 10:00 p.m. A V-shaped forma- tion was sighted over Paulden at about 8:15 p.m. It About the author Rapp's interest in lasers began at an early age, less than a decade after their invention in 1960. As a teenager, he constructed a gas laser for a science fair project. He later received a B.S. in Physics and has pursued an engineering career for the past 21 years. Much of this time was spent in the aerospace industry. Seven years were devoted exclusively to working R&D contracts with the military, analyzing and testing the effects of lasers on sensors. Specifically, he worked in an area known as \"laser hardening.\" It was his job to analyze the path of a laser from its source to the target, calculating atmospheric losses and determining the ir- radiance on a sensor. The sensor could be located in a space platform, missile, or night vision device. Having knowledge of the optical system and internal compo- nents of the sensor, he would determine its vulnerabil- ity to the laser exposure. Using available laser harden- ing (protection) technologies, these sensors were modi- fied and re-tested. Rapp gathered data in the labora- tory or field, performed theoretical analyses, and pre- pared presentations and final reports on the results. was then sighted over Phoenix at about 8:30 p.m.. The formation continued to move SE to Tucson where it turned and headed NW. It was last sighted over Kingman at 8:45 p.m.. Hundreds of people observed these lights; however, only a single person video taped this event. The formation was seen as 5 to 6 amber lights that appeared to change orientation, although some Phoenix residents observed a direct fly-over, claiming to see structure between the lights. Some estimated it at 10,000-15,000 feet trav- eling at 300-400 knots, gliding silently. Others reported it as very low; so low they thought it was going to crash. The second set of sightings occurred at 10 p.m. in a direction SW of Phoenix. As many as 9 amber lights, estimated at over a mile in length, were seen as a slowly descending arc. These lights appeared in a sequence, and were seen to disappear in much the same manner. There were several individuals who video taped this event. No one reported a fly-over. Technical but necessary This background information will be helpful in understanding some of the comments that follow. I have transcribed portions of the Ed Dames' interview, which are pertinent. Following his statements are my re- sponses, much of which are very technical, but neces- sary for a complete and correct understanding of what lasers can and cannot do. Ed Dames begins by telling Art that this event was created using lasers, and de- scribes the specifics of how it was accomplished. In general, he discusses how two or more ultraviolet la- sers from different locations could have their beams"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1998 Page 13 Raw video by Mike Krzyston from the top of Mt. Ridge. intersect to create visible interference patterns in the sky. Dames'explanation requires the use of ultraviolet lasers; otherwise, the beams projecting from the ground would be visible and expose an obvious hoax. Ed Dames: \"At the point where the two lasers intersect there would be interference, constructive and destruc- tive interference. There would be standing wave pat- terns. This is all Physics 101.\" My Response: Well, not in the physics class where I was taught. Lasers have two distinct properties not exhib- ited by white light sources. They are monochromatic and coherent. Monochromatic means that it is light of a single wavelength or color. Coherence means that all the light emanating from the source is in phase (i.e. crest to crest and valley to valley). Another laser off the assembly line would have these same properties except there is nothing that ensures both lasers are in phase with respect to each other. This is the basis of interference; light from the same source is split and made to interfere with itself where the two beams have ir.neled over different optical paths. This path length di I kience accounts for a slight variation in phase, caus- ing j stable standing wave interference pattern. This phenomenon cannot happen unless both intersecting beams are initially in phase. There is a property exhibited by monochro- matic light sources called temporal coherence. This is the interval over which the lightwave resembles a si- nusoid, The average time interval during which the lightwave oscillates in a predictable way is the coher- ence time. Observed from a fixed point in space, the passing lightwave appears fairly sinusoidal for some number of oscillations between abrupt changes in phase. The coherence time of interfering beams from two different lasers can be appreciable (milliseconds) and can be detected electronically, but not by the hu- man eye. Thus it is unlikely that two or more lasers can be made to produce any type of standing wave interference pattern as described. ^11 intersecting la- ser beams must be split from one source to produce multiple interference patterns. This is impractical to implement, as I will describe later. Ed Dames: \"This interference would produce reflections and a glow from the dust that is scattered in the atmo- sphere. And that glow would appear to move straight ahead very fast. All they were, were glowing fuzzy interference patterns.... There are a couple of technolo- gies called Laser Doppler Anemometry or Laser Dop- pler (inaudible). And what these technologies do is to use lasers, a split beam laser, of the same color, to focus on a point in a gas or a liquid. And that point glows. And the feedback from that glowing point can be utilized as a tool to measure the speed and the size of the particles that are flowing across that point.... Now apply that same type of technology to the atmo- sphere, the same way that the LIDAR Light Direction and Ranging are used in weather. Most of your listen- ers might be familiar. Sometimes you can see a big"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 October 1998 MUFON UFO Journal green or red light over the city. And that's a weather station taking remote sensing ... reading of the mois- ture content and other th i ng s i n the atmosphere for your particular city. Now if ihut big laser beam that shines across the city were ultraviolet instead of visible, you would not see it. But if another laser beam, an ultra- violet beam, intersected it, at that point of intersection there would be an elongated or roundish fuzzy glow. A glow in the visible light range.\" My Response: Ed Dames appears to be confusing two dis- tinct phenomenons: interference and backscatter (which he refers to as glow). Interference, as a result of two beams initially in phase and re-converging, produces a series of alternating light and dark lines 01 ring^ de- pending on the aperture shape. This pattern dibpluys intensity variations at the same wavelength. A^ the two beams come together over different optical paths, their phases shift slightly with respect to each other. Thus, there is constructive and destructive interference as he indicated; however, there is no substantial change or shift in the frequency (color). If an ultraviolet (UV) laser were split into two beams and re-converged to create an interference pattern, that pattern would exist at the same UV wavelength as the source and would remain invisible to the human eye. Dames also mentions reflections and a glow from dust scattered in the atmosphere. This is exactly what happens when a visible laser shines into the at- mosphere containing aerosols (e.g. water droplets, ice, dust, org.imc material). Backscatter of that same vis- ible lighr bouncing off these aerosols produces a dif- fuse glow. Depending on the wavelength and the size of the scattering agent (aerosol or molecule) two kinds of backscatter may be produced (Rayleigh or Mie). There is no loss of energy, only directional redistribu- tion of the same wavelength scattered back to the source. LIDARs are suggested as an example to prove his point. The reason >ou ^ee a green or red glow over the city is because that is the original color of the laser source. You are simply observing visible backscattered light. LIDARs may operat.e using any number of wave- lengths: infrared, visible, or ultraviolet depending on the molecular absorption band of interest. There are three general types of LIDARs: range finders, DIAL, and Doppler LIDARs. The first type is used to measure the distance to a solid target. The second, Differential Absorption LIDAR, is used to measure chemical concentrations in the atmosphere. A DIAL LIDAR uses two different wavelengths, each selected so that one wavelength is absorbed by the molecule of interest while the other is not. The difference in intensity of the two return sig- nals can be used to deduce the concentration of the molecule being investigated. The Doppler LIDAR is used to measure the velocity of a target (solid or atmo- spheric). When the light hits a target moving towards or away from the LIDAR, the wavelength of the light is shifted to a slightly longer or shorter wavelength. This is known as a Doppler shift, hence the name. I am not aware of any interference that occurs using LIDARs, although multiple laser beams are involved in their operation. Back in the 1980's as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), the U.S. developed artificial guide stars as a method of improving the optical reso- lution of earthbased telescopes. This method, since de- classified, used a special dual beam high-powered la- ser to produce a visible wavelength output of 589 na- nometers. This wavelength was chosen since it is the atomic resonance line of sodium. The laser, when trained on the mesosphere 90 km high, created a glow due to resonance fluorescence. I see few options available for producing vis- ible spots in the sky using UV lasers. Perhaps a very powerful laser focused to a small spot in the atmo- sphere could be used to produce a visible glow caused by fluorescence or air breakdown. I cannot quote a specific laser power without performing careful calcu- lations. However, this method would be very difficult to perform and would require expensive, sophisticated equipment. Even if this were the mechanism used, it would be unlikely that a group of persons would be able to slave a series of lasers focused at the same altitude, to produce moving visible spots and project them over long distances. Besides, if lasers were the cause of the lights over Phoenix, what produced the lights seen over Paulden, Tucson, and Kingman? Ed Dames: \"It can all be done from one place within 50 to 100 feet along a straight line, lined up within 50 to 100 feet. It could actually be done with three lasers but it was probably done with five. Our results show five lasers. You could use one in the center and split the beam and you could nicely, you could project out to several miles a really nice delta-wing consisting of five dots UFO. But if you try to make that UFO move across the horizon then you'd run into some problems technically. But five lasers would do the trick. This is just like a fireworks company. This is the same kind of business as fireworks. In fact laser light shows are sometimes combined with fireworks displays. What we have is an on-demand phenomenon that's produced by the laser light show commonly called lumia. Now lumia is not really popular because all it is is just a glowing fuzzy display that moves across the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1998 Page 15 spectator's field of view. It's not really pretty particu- larly if its just sitting there or standing there in the air as a standing wave form....It's not really difficult to do....We wire-diagramed this at work with some really good experts and way less than 2 watts of power per laser will do it for you as some of your engineers out there know.\" My Response: Responding to the second half of his statement first-! was not familiar with lumia, so I contacted a company which is in the business of producing indoor and outdoor laser light shows. They described lumia as \"a swirling cloud-like effect usually projected on a surface.\" Also, they said the effect is created by the result of interference of light waves produced by \"shin- ing a laser through various irregularly-shaped objects.\" Their use of the word \"surface\" implies an indoor dis- play; however, it does not preclude the use of smoke (after a fireworks display) as a screen for projecting lumia. I suspect that because of the distance involved and the irregularity of the smoke, it is less effective. Again, this phenomenon is produced using vis- ible lasers. The glow produced is nothing more than backscatter of that same wavelength off of the aerosol particles. The addition of the interference \"effect\" just adds a little pizzazz to an otherwise not-so-interesting display. Interference has nothing to do with the cause of the glow itself. The company did not answer my question regarding the use of UV lasers to produce visible lumia. Complex setup required For the sake of argument, assume that cross- ing UV laser beams produces a visible glow in the at- mosphere. I cannot imagine the complexity that would be required to produce a reasonably symmetrical V-shaped pattern whereby the shape is maintained over the distances observed by Phoenix residents. Obviously, several lasers would have to be involved, operating from separate locations, to be able to produce the 5 to 9 observed glowing spots. This means that multiple motorized platforms carrying lasers were somehow synchronized perfectly for the duration of the event. You don't just throw a switch and produce the effect on the first try without lots of experiments and adjustments. Near perfect synchronicity in angular displacement of the beams would be required to produce a moving V-shaped pat- tern. Another problem is that if multiple beams are crossed to produce multiple visible spots, then these beams would most likely intersect at other altitudes causing more spots outside the horizontal plane of the formation. Except for the 10 p.m. sighting which ap- peared arc-shaped, Arizona residents observed a rea- sonably \"planar\" movement of lights. Last fall, the Discovery Channel aired an hour-long investigative report on the \"Phoenix Lights\" incident. It showed fairly convincing evidence that the 10 p.m. event occurred SW of Phoenix, beyond the Estrella Mountain range. An independent analysis con- ducted by Cognitech, Inc., an image processing firm, analyzed the video of the second event taken by Mike Krzyston. They superimposed his nighttime video with a daylight video from the same location and determined that each light disappeared exactly when it came in contact with the edge of the mountain range. This seemed to confirm why the lights were mysteriously extinguishing in sequence. It also coincided in time and direction with Operation Snowbird, a night maneuver conducted by the Maryland Air National Guard. That night they claimed to have dropped a series of illumi- nation flares at the NorthTAC Range, located 30 miles SW of Phoenix. \"Phoenix lights\" not explained Their analysis certainly does not explain the \"Phoenix Lights\" as illumination flares, as many would have you believe. In fact, it does not necessarily even preclude that the lights seen during the 10 p.m. event were separate objects. There are still too many un- knowns. Speculation suggests that the second event was indeed a military operation used to confuse the public regarding a real (unknown) sighting of a forma- tion of lights earlier in the evening. Real or not, the second event appears to have occurred beyond the Estrella Mountains. Also during this event, no one reported any lights directly over- head, contrary to the 8:30 p.m. sightings. This would have to place the lasers and operating crew described by Ed Dames at this location and time. If lasers were used to produce the \"Phoenix Lights\" and were set up beyond the mountain range at 10 p.m., it would have been impossible to project them at the altitudes seen by residents in the 8:30 p.m. sighting. They had two setups you say? Well, they would need much more equipment than that to have produced the lights seen earlier between Paulden, Tucson, and Kingman. Extremely difficult The issues I have stated above describe the dif- ficulties in creating the \"Phoenix Lights\" using lasers. Ed Dames presented an eloquent explanation, making it appear as a simple prank perpetuated by a laser light show company. He claims it is easy to do. I say it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, under these cir- cumstances. (This article originally appeared in the Sep- tember issue of The UFO Enigma.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly One of the more interesting and puzzling cases involving a UFO is the Cash-Landrum incident which took place east of New Caney, TX, in 1980. The chief investigator of this case and author of this excellent book is John Schuessler, MUFON's Deputy Director and a UFO researcher since 1965. He also adminis- ters the MUFON Medical Committee, is a member of the UFO Research Coalition Board of Directors, was a founding member and past president of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, was a founding member of the Houston-based Vehicle Internal Systems Investi- gative Team (VISIT), and is a member of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). His background includes engineering work in the U.S. manned space program, where he served from 1962 until his recent retirement. This book not only recounts in detail the inci- dent and the resulting injuries to the ihree individuals involved, but also describes efforts 10 got the govern- ment to acknowledge the encounter and lo compen- sate the victims, since U.S. helicopters Deemed to be involved, and the object itself may have been govern- ment-owned. Schuessler's description of the work required in handling this case makes an excellent supplement to the manual for field investigators. The incident itself, as many readers already know, involved Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and seven-year-old Colby Landrum. As they were driving through the \"Piney Woods\" area, they spotted a bright light which came closer and closer to their auto, fi- nally hovering in front of them over the highway. The object seemed to be diamond-shaped, gray-metallic, and as large as a water tower, but so bright that details were obscured. Though frightened, Betty stopped the car and got outside for a better look. There was such intense heat that she had to use the tail of her leather coat to grab the hot door handle of the car to get back inside. Colby was nearly hysterical with fear, and all three said they felt they might die. Suddenly flames shot from the object and it rose into the air. It was then that the three victims observed helicopters \"chasing\" the object. They were eventually able to count 23 helicopters, most with two large rotors. Betty later noted that she had left the en- gine running when she got out of the car, but that it had quit during the encounter. The radio had also gone dead. A later examination by Schuessler revealed a large burned area on the highway. Although the incident was over, troubles were just beginning for the three victims, all of whom had been relatively healthy prior to the incident. All quickly showed physical effects, such as headaches, burning eyes, vomiting, and diarrhea. Betty, the only one out- side the auto, had to be hospitalized. Her appearance had changed so much that her daughter hardly recog- nized her. She was treated for blisters on her body, but would not tell the doctors what had happened. Two days after she was hospitalized, her hair began to fall out. Thus began a series of physical ailments which nearly killed her. and which continue to this day. Vickie suffered many of the same effects, including loss of hair, but to a lesser degree than Betty. Colby suffered fewer physical effects, but endured significant psycho- logical effects, all of which are documented in the book. Schuessler considers this case so significant that he used it in briefing the recent Scientific Review Panel organized by Peter Sturrock. The panel con- cluded that some sightings are accompanied by physi- cal evidence that deserves scientific study. Efforts by lawyers to get some sort of assis- tance from the government for the victims was unsuc- cessful, due mainly to the fact that the identity of the helicopters could not be established, despite extensive work by Schuessler and others, and the question of whether the UFO was extraterrestrial or government- owned could not be determined. (The plaintiffs were forced to argue both ways in trying to establish negli- gence, while the government denied ownership, sug- gesting it was a true unknown and not the government's responsibility). A recommendation We're all drowning in garbage these days, so it's easy to overlook a genuinely worthwhile book amid all the worthless ones out there.

Dear Mr. Connelly: After years of study concerning the subjects of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) origination, eti- ology (disease cause), pathogenesis (disease develop- ment), epidemiology (infection spread) and other prop- erties, I have devised a concept which I believe logi- cally explains all the known facts. To my knowledge there is no contradictory reliable evidence in the litera- ture on HIVsorUFOs. According to this concept, HIVs which cause the fatal disease AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) in otherwise healthy persons are the pur- poseful products of UFO-related alien intelligence. I call this concept the AIDS-ET Connection. I believe it is the only way all known facts can be logically ex- plained; therefore I present it as the truth. The AIDS-ET Connection is a unifying, unor- thodox concept. Unifying because it provides answers for HIV and UFO interrelated questions. Unorthodox by requiring that UFO-related phenomena are real. The AIDS-ET Connection is based on six lines of evidence. Very briefly: 1. HIV-l's origin is otherwise unknown. It defi- nitely did not come from SIV's or human research. 2. The HIV pandemics began with at least two different selectively infectious strains on two differ- ent continents at the same time. The probability of this occurring by chance can be disregarded. 3. HIV-1 has numerous properties of an ideal Biological Warfare agent. The success of its introduc- tion and course is evident in AmFAR's estimate of 110 million infected by 2000 AD. 4. Cattle mutilation phenomena become logi- cally understandable in that biological materials re- moved are possibly related to HIV replication (blood) and study of HIV sexual transmission. 5. UFO extensive activities of abducting and implanting people for study and follow up sampling are logically explained as being related to development, spread, and monitoring of HIVs. 6. Abductees under hypnosis have repeated in- formation from aliens that the purpose of AIDS is de- struction of human civilization, followed by coloniza- tion. Abductees report existence of alien/human hy- brids for colonization. Laurie Garrett makes numerous relevant state- ments. From her The Coining Plague, Penguin 1994: \"In light of this duality in occurrence many people sought iatrogenic or conspiratorial explanations for the appearance of HIV-1.\" (pg. 380) \"Though it had been the focus of attention of the greatest minds in contem- porary biomedical science on at least four continents, nobody by 1994 had yet pinpointed a time, place, or key event responsible for the emergence of HIV-1.\" (pg. 389) Mirko D. Grmek makes numerous relevant statements. From his The History Of AIDS, Princeton UP, 1990: \"The discovery of HIV-2, however, com- pels us to admit a double and even simultaneous out- break of the AIDS agents. Such a coincidence is ex- tremely improbable, even impossible, if held to be the result of chance biological mutations.\" (pg. 153) And in the immortal words of Sherlock Holmes, \"When all other possibilities have been eliminated, the one remaining is the truth, no matter how unlikely it may seem.\" If you have any relevant information, ques- tions, or comments, and to receive a detailed write-up with references, please contact me.

I am continually amazed at what people presume to \"know\" about alier genetic make-up and scientific limitations. No doubt Mr. Smith is well educated and e'x- r perienced in Earth science, but does this really extend to other planets and inhabitants? There doesn't seem to be any doubt in Journal readers' minds that interstellar travel is possible and that \"they\" are here. Likewise, there are countless reports from experiencers that hybrid-appearing beings exist, so there is reason to believe that race-mixing is possible too.

Intriguing mysteries of this sort cry out for care- ful scientific study, rather than New Age pablum. We should also keep firmly in mind that any connection between crop circles and UFOs at this point is only speculative. No strong or persuasive evidence exists to link the two. The Varginha case Bob Pratt is a respected reporter, and I am pleased to see his article (along with Cynthia Luce) on the Varginha, Brazil, creature encounter case. Nevertheless, extreme caution is justified. Some apocryphal elements internally raise suspicions, including the allegation that NORAD no- tified Brazilian authorities about the UFOs, NORAD being the North American Air Defense Command. Such a notification to Brazil by U.S. authorities, if it hap- pened at all, more likely would have come from the National Military Command Center, or the Pentagon, in Washington, D.C. Sensational cases with profound implications require meticulous investigation and documentation, and cannot simply be accepted at face value no matter how initially credible they may appear to be. (\"Extraor- dinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\") Ques- tionable aspects must be explained or accounted for in some manner. Suspended judgment and careful study is the proper course, as it usually is in complex and controversial cases of this sort. I argued similarly about the Gulf Breeze, FL, photographs. The abduction exchange As an interested bystander with substantial credits of my own when it comes to abduction research, I found the MUFON Forum exchange between Chris Styles and Ted Davis interesting. Davis says that Styles resembles the \"skeptics\" (better, debunkers) \"...by cri- tiquing something he has not investigated.\" Without taking sides (again, we do need to be very critical minded, especially about the nature and meaning of abduction reports), I was reminded of the following A commentary Journal Editor Dwight Connelly has invited me to contribute a regular column that would be \"a review of articles in the previous issue, as well as general comments about what is going on.\" Since my \"veteran\" status gives me a long-term perspective on facts and issues, I am able to provide information and insights that might not otherwise be available to MUFON members and Journal readers. What I propose to do is not so much second-guess what contributors to the Journal say, but instead to point out factual errors, mis- conceptions, additional data, and the like. Thus, what I say will-I hope-refine and supplement the reporting in the Journal and benefit all se- rious seekers after truth. My remarks no doubt will also include opinions, but they will be la- beled as such. What I report will be based on 40 years of research and investigation, including data from my update of The UFO Evidence which is scheduled for publication by Barnes & Noble in the first half of 1999. \"Volume II\" picks up where the original volume left off in 1964, and reports UFO case summaries, tables, and other information through the mid-1990s, some 30 years and 500 pages worth. I can also draw on the large and growing Donald E. Keyhoe Ar- chives, which I have established for historians and scholarly researchers. retort by Don Ecker of UFO Magazine in a debate with a skeptical scientist on television: \"Scientists should investigate the unexplained, not explain the uninvestigated.\" Wish I'd said that! The hybrids issue Although comments like those of zoologist Malcolm Smith about the \"impossibility\" of alien-hu- man hybrids should be welcome and encouraged, and part of the debate, it gives me pause when anyone says \"impossible.\" All too many scientists over the past 50 years have invoked the alleged impossibility of objects mak- ing right-angle turns without falling apart, flying si-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 1998 Page 19 lently at high speed through the atmosphere, etc. As Dr. J. Allen Hynek observed long ago, our science prob- ably is not the pinnacle of achievement in the universe. Someone may well have a superior science and tech- nology that presently is beyond our full understanding. The EVIDENCE of UFOs if carefully studied could yield important clues for improving our scientific THEORIES. The question of youth Thomas Lyon's letter about MUFON youth memberships brought to mind the NICAP Youth Coun- cil of 35 years ago, which I established for the very reasons that he cites. We encouraged intelligent young members to pursue scientific studies, think critically, and exchange information and ideas. It was a mutually rewarding program, and had some lasting benefits. Religion and UFOs The philosophical notion of an \"ideological separation between religion and UFOs,\" discussed by Dr. Barry Downing, who says we don't need one, can be debated. But his remarks are thoughtful and worth- while, as always. UFOs almost certainly have profound implications for both science and religion. I happen to agree that \"waiting for the UFO reality to choose to reveal its nature more clearly to us\" may be in the cards, whether that reality is sacred or profane. A troubling feature of \"ufology\" that contin- ues to plague us is the modern-day lack of carefully investigated UFO sightings, especially of the \"Daylight Disc,\" CE-I, and CE-II variety. A fair number of sightings obviously are being made in recent years, but they tend to remain unchecked, uninvestigated, and purely anecdotal. Follow-up reports after investigation are badly needed in most cases. My ideas and opinions are, of course, subject to challenge and dispute. Letters to the Editor are in- vited. The dialogue represented in MUFON Forum is an important element of rational debate and discussion. Science involves a give-and-take process that gradu- ally refines and delineates more carefully what we think we know. Thought for the month: What \"ufology\" needs is fewer (people claiming to have) answers and more (people asking good) questions.

Vermont sightings Thomas McFarland, Vermont State Director, re- ports: \"Things have started off with a bang with UFO sightings and development of the MUFON Vermont web site. A couple in their late twenties on Aug. 3,1998, saw a bright \"shinmering\" light 'in the north sky and again the next night about the same time. The object was thirty degrees off the horizon, moving very slowly, \"almost hovering.\" They watched it through a high powered rifle scope until it traveled out of sight. The object had three bright evenly spaced lights in a hori- zontal line. On the outside of these lights was another white light, but much dimmer. The object appeared round and had both red and green flashing lights. Georgia sighting On Aug. 10, 1998, a former college football player reported, he had seen a UFO in east LaGrange at approximately 12:30 a.m. Getting up from bed, he said he noticed as he passed his window that it was totally dark. As a street light is only 70 feet from his two-story high bedroom window, and is always spill- ing light into his apartment, he knew something was amiss. Looking north he saw nothing except gray dark- ness-no light, no sky, no trees, no stars; nothing but dark gray. While trying to locate his familiar street light, he saw that \"something\" was beginning to slowly move away. Non-blinking red and yellow lights soon ap- peared. Then he saw an intensely bright bluish-green florescent light. When the unknown object was at 100 yards away, its entire perimeter cou'd be seen in the confines of his 36-inch wide window. The dark gray object looked like a \"loaf of bread\" seen from one end, and had yellow and red lights around its edges. The bottom of the UFO was squared off and its straight perpendicular sides led to a more rounded and sym- metrical top. Somewhere from the middle or on the squared off bottom edge of the UFO the bluish green light shined brilliantly. He watched the object ascend at a 20 degree angle until it leveled after 20 seconds. Suddenly, it streaked off at a speed many times faster than a jet plane. Its green light left a trail. The UFO was considerably larger than a house, was less than 70 feet away, and made no sound. After it left, the view outside returned to normal. The street lamp was on and nearby houses and trees were lighted from the glare of the lamp. Weather conditions were 85 degrees F, partly cloudy with southerly winds of 5 mph. It was hovering at less than twenty feet high for thirty seconds before departing northward. A check with 911 revealed no other UFO reports.

The \"Leonid watch\" gets into high gear this year and in 1999 as Earth prepares for a possible \"meteor storm\" on Nov. 17. Every 33 years the Leonid shower increases spectacularly from its normally small num- bers to a flurry of thousands per hour as our planet passes through the densest swarm of particles orbiting the Sun close behind the parent comet (named Tempel-Tuttle). So many Leonids fell in 1833 that people were awakened by light flashes spilling through bedroom windows. One watcher estimated their fre- quency at half the rate of falling snowflakes in an av- erage snowstorm! The western U.S. in 1966 may have experienced the greatest Leonid show of all, with rates estimated up to 150,000 or more per hour over a 20-minute span. Although this year's peak is predicted to fall during the daylight hours for North America (thus favoring Asia), there is enough uncertainty that it is worthwhile for American observers to watch the sky that morning from about 2 or 3 a.m. to dawn. The ex- tremely rapid bluish meteors appear from the direc- tion of Leo the Lion's Sickle in the SE. Many of them are bright, and half leave behind persistent wakes called \"trains.\" Moon Phases: Full moon—Nov. 4 (Nearest Moon of the year) Last quarter-Nov. 10 (J New moon-Nov. 18 First quarter—Nov. 26 The Stars: During mid-evening hours Pegasus and its Great Square still dominate the southern heavens.

Don Berliner chairman of FUFOR Despite changes, the Fund for UFO Research con- tinues to operate as it has since its inception in 1979; raising money to support scientific research and edu- cational projects aimed at shedding light on the UFO mystery. Richard H. Hall retired as Fund Chairman at the end of 1997, and was soon replaced by Board Member Don Berliner. Don has been affiliated with the Fund since its for- mation, and has been a member of the Board for 10 years. He has been a delegate to the UFO Research Coalition since it was formed with MUFON and CUFOS in 1994. It is his goal to build upon the marvelous founda- tion created by his predecessors, Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee and Richard Hall, and thus to move us closer to a true understanding of the greatest mystery of the 20th century, using the tools of science. Me Camp bell's work now on diskettes The articles and papers of former MUFON Direc- tor for Research James M. McCampbell have been scanned into a computer for distribution on diskettes. The first one will include most of the technical articles that appeared after his early book UFOlogy, New In- sights from Science and Common Sense (1973) (1976), plus a major essay on \"Effects Upon Society if UFOs are Real.\" Mr. McCampbell was not only MUFON's first Di- rector for Research, but was a symposium speaker in 1975, 1977, 1979, and 1983.

Innuendos on the Internet During the past few weeks, several people have placed messages on the Internet or via e-mail spread- ing rumors and untruths about MUFON. No sooner has one of these critical statements been filed than someone else adds their off-handed opinion. These are people who may or may not identify themselves. Many people spend hours and hours at their com- puters entertaining themselves. If they have a casual interest in UFOs, they seek out one of the numerous UFO websites. Only sex websites exceed UFO sites in number, and MUFON's extensive international and state websites are readily accessible. Based upon the wild comments and statements being made, it is evi- dent that these individuals are not members of MUFON nor are they knowledgeable about MUFON. It would be nearly impossible for our webmaster or our e-mail operators to monitor all of these sources and reply to each one of them as they appear. We do not intend to reply. Our e-mail operators are down-loading and printing the ones they do observe. Since this material is so far from the truth, we are very concerned that it will give uninitiated people an unfa- vorable impression of MUFON. New people on the nets may have only a limited knowledge of UFOs or MUFON and tend to believe everything they read. We are also extremely concerned that some MUFON members may read this material and believe it without questioning either MUFON or the source. On the other hand, a former State Director from Indi- ana suggested positive ideas that can prove beneficial to MUFON, and I have discussed these ideas with him on the telephone. MUFON will not attempt to reply to these charac- ters who have nothing better to do than try to find some- thing to complain about or find fault. Since the Mutual UFO Network is not only the leading UFO organiza- tion in the world, but the largest, we automatically be- come a target for sniping and criticism. We probably should feel flattered by this attention; however, con- sidering the sources (and they know who they are), quite the opposite is true. The dissenters who are taking potshots at MUFON on the internet or via e-mail is a clue to the sad state of affairs that could threaten the scientific study of ufology. Instead of working with reputable UFO orga- nizations by providing positive help, these insidious folks are spreading false information about MUFON, which could be detrimental to MUFON and ufology. They seem to think that they are being cute and derive some form of disturbed enjoyment by attempting to undermine MUFON's 29 years of work. We invite letters to the editor if our members would like to respond to this travesty. May I take this oppor- tunity to thank the loyal members who have supported MUFON for up to as many as 29 years. You are now reading the 366th monthly edition of SKYLOOK/ MUFON UFO Journal. No other UFO publication has even approached this accomplishment. We hope that our members are proud to be associated with MUFON as we enter our 30th year."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 October 1998 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE Walter Aridrus Tt^.\"'''*-C* 'O .
