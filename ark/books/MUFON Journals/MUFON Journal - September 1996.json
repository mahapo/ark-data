It's sort of a show-biz type question, I know, but please bring us up to date on some of the ups and downs of that time in terms of your research if you will. Hopkins: A long, complex question. Well, the first thing I should say is that I never felt from the beginning that I was just going to write books on UFOs for an occupation. My basic rea- son for writing each of the three books was that I had discovered aspects of the phenomenon that I felt absolutely needed to be made public. And when I finished and published \"Missing Time,\" I had discovered at that point certain issues, such as the idea that abductions were extremely widespread, because people didn't necessarily remember all of it, which was a very different view than we had, say, after the Hill and the Pascagoula and the Travis Walton cases, where the person remembered a great deal without hypnosis. But when I found that many people remembered virtually nothing, I realized that it was presumably a very widespread phenomenon. I also discovered and wrote about screen memo- ries, which until that time 1 don't think had been known or dis- covered or written about. I discovered the issue of physical marks after abductions, the scars. And, very importantly, the fact that this was a repeat experience, that it didn't necessarily just happen once. All those things were so important, those patterns which I had noticed in a number of different cases, that I felt that they required a book. And then I did nothing about it and felt I wasn't going to do anything more, until or if there was some other major discovery. And of course what I wrote about in \"Intruders\" is the whole gy- necological, genetic focus, the reproductive focus of the UFO phenomenon, which is of course of extraordinary importance. So that required the second book. Still, I had no intention to write a third — only if something else came up of equal importance. And in \"Witnessed\" I had not only the issue of a witnessed ab- duction, but the idea that it suggested alien—at least tentative"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL I feel like the guy in the old story who was being ridden out of town on a rail after being tarred and feathered, who said \"If it wasn't for the honor of the thing, I'd be very upset.\" September 1996 Number 341 Page 4 alien—involvement in trying to shape or af- fect human politics. Plus the other longr term alien involvement in human lives, what I call the Mickey and Baby Ann phe- nomenon. And so therefore that demanded a book. But I am not going to write a fourth book unless something else turns up in my research that requires further exploration, further publication. Q: I think I'm still trying to grapple with the issue of your relative fame in the field and the acknowledged fact that you're the granddaddy of them all. Hopkins: Well, of course, that's the issue of how you're regarded by your contempo- raries, and it may be better for them to talk about [it] than me. Q: Okay. Hopkins: Certainly, one becomes a target. And the one thing I will say is that one is as distinguished by one's enemies as by one's friends, and the fact that I was the target of the \"Nova\" program, I suppose that's the fi- nal sign of recognition in a strange, perverse way. Q: That you're so important that they chose you as a target? Hopkins: I feel like the guy in the old story who was being ridden out of town on a rail after being tarred and feathered, who said \"If it wasn't for the honor of the thing, I'd be very upset.\" Q: That's a familiar joke that occurs to me sometimes, too. But to the new book. Over and over, one is forced to consider the ex- tremely complicated way the events in \"Witnessed\" are constructed and fit together into a narrative that eludes any easy defini- tion. Can you sum it up for us? Can you re- state the story in simple terms and point out the ultimate significance of the major events to an audience unfamiliar with the book and its many players? Hopkins: Well, I would say it does elude any kind of short analysis. I have never dealt with as complicated a series of events. Neither of the books that I've written had nearly as many individuals and witnesses involved in the same case. The inter-locking pieces of this case are infinitely more com- plex and numerous than they were in either of the earlier books. I just say simply at the outset that one of the most important as- pects of this book is the fact that in this one case at least, it would seem that the UFO occupants are deliberately showing off by abducting someone in full view of an im- portant political figure, perhaps several im- portant political figures, and other wit- nesses, peripheral witnesses. They were tak- ing the most overt step that they have yet taken, so far as I know, in terms of affecting the way the abduction and the UFO phe- nomenon is viewed by the world. Just as the public side of this event, the November 30, 1989. witnessed abduction, just as that is of extraordinary importance, just as important are all the, let's say, interpersonal and much more subtle involvements of alien intelli- gence in human lives over a long-term pe- riod that this case also revealed. These pat- terns aren't solid yet because of the small number of cases involved, but one is the alien \"co-option\" that I go into, and the other is the long term involvement in pair- ing off abductees from childhood on and observing their behavior. Linda Cortile by Dennis Stacy"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Q: I'm going to get to that later. I have some questions. Hopkins: But those things all of course are extremely important and basic to Linda's credibility and all of these other issues. It's very hard to sum this book up, as people will discover when they try to read it. Q: That's probably why I asked that ques- tion, to try to make explaining it easier. Hopkins: Well, it's not easy to do, as you well know. Q: What are your hopes and expectations for the new book? You talk a great deal about anticipating the inevitable rejection by the debunkers. Hopkins: Oh, yeah. Well, that's already happened. You see, the book doesn't have to exist — the debunkers will not read it, most likely, and they will not do anything more than they've already done, which is simply to say, \"This didn't happen because it can't have happened.\" That's the basic skeptical line. I just hope that, well, if we assume that a very, very large number of Americans and people around the world accept the reality of the UFO phenomenon, there's another enormous group that is extremely intrigued by it. And of course there's a smaller group that would never accept it even if it hap- pened to them. But the large middle group that's intrigued but not persuaded that this is going on, may find this book shoving them into the \"persuaded\" category. I think that's one of the hopes I have for it. I majorly hope that this will persuade some of the other witnesses who were there that night to come forward—and some of the people whom I've dealt with in the book who still have withheld their names and public state- ments—that it will move them to come for- ward, too. That's a basic, basic hope. Q: We've touched on this before, and I know you don't want to be put in the posi- tion of flattering yourself, but I did want to ask how you think the book will be viewed by your fellow researchers and the UFO community in general? Hopkins: It's hard to guess in advance how it will be received. I must say that several of my colleagues, who I name in the book, David Jacobs, Jerry Clark, Richard Hall, for example, have read large sections of the manuscript very approvingly with sugges- tions. I think the book will still come as a major surprise to most everybody in the field. Because people are going to find out that whatever they had heard in bits and pieces about this case, that what they thought they knew, was actually only a tiny percentage of what was actually going on. So, I assume surprise, I certainly hope so, will be a major reaction. Q: That was something I was happy to see when I was reading, how much more was there than we had been told through your little intentional leaks. Hopkins: Exactly. I think that's basic. Peter Robbins, who is my assistant, read the manuscript and said that he felt like he knew only ten percent of the actual case material prior to finishing it. Q: At one point you told me it was very dif- ficult to finish \"Witnessed\" because the story you were telling never slowed down long enough to complete the writing process. Hopkins: Well, it always went to some ex- tent in fits and starts, but there would be a number of incidents happening quickly and falling on one another, and there would be sort of a lull, but there have been incidents since the manuscript and book was com- pleted and a number of incidents which had occurred in the year and a half or so before I ended the essential chronology of the book, but it just has to stop someplace. And I found a convenient place to stop and that was it. So, there will be more going on, though. Q: That's the second part of my question. Have any new and significant events hap- pened since completing the book? Hopkins: I'm not prepared to go into any new material for the reason that I've learned not to bring up any material, no matter how important, unless I'm prepared to bring it up very fully and completely. In other words, unless I'm ready to sit down and write on particular incidents, let's say a 30 or 40- page article, I'm just going to have to be quiet about it until such a time as I do have the energy to bring things more up to date. In this one case at least, it would seem that the UFO occu- pants are de- liberately showing off by abducting someone in full view of an important political fig- ure, perhaps several im- portant politi- cal figures.

And a tremendous sense of helplessness that a person was taken over, but this is extremely widespread and I think we're going to hear more and more [about it]. September 1996 Number 341 Page6 Q: Well, you may want to dodge this ques- tion, too. Since the book's completion, have you had any further contact with \"the third man\"? And is there any hope remaining that he will come forward and verify his in- volvement? Hopkins: Well, the answer to the first ques- tion briefly is \"No.\" There's been no con- tact. And the answer to the second is hope. I profoundly hope that he will come forward. That's where it stands. The ball is in his court. Q: So you don't think he's'just said a defi- nite \"No\" and that's the end of the discus- sion? Hopkins: Well, after all, I do not know him in any kind of an intimate way. The extent of my knowledge of him on a first-hand ba- sis is all in the book for people to judge, and they can guess how well I know him based on what they read there. We have had the one meeting and it's very hard for me to read another's mind and their intentions, but I would say anyone who advances very far in the world of politics and diplomacy learns how to play their cards very, very close. And I would say this man is such a man. Q: One impression I have from reading \"Witnessed\" is that a very high stakes game was being played that required a great deal of courage and perseverance on your part, as well as on the part of the Cortile family. Did you ever feel that things were danger- ously out of control, like you had stepped into some kind of suspense movie and there was no way out? Hopkins: Well, I myself didn't. I definitely think that Linda and her family absolutely did. I mean, I saw the change physically in Linda and her husband, and the edginess, the worry and so forth. Because Linda was really bearing the brunt of it. I was aware, I suppose, that I could have been potentially at risk, but so long as I maintained as cor- dial a relationship as I did with Richard and Dan, I felt safe. I did not put in the book transcripts of the number of long, taped recordings that I sent to them. But I did my best to keep them calm, cool and collected under the circumstances because these men were going through the tortures of the damned themselves. I think that one of the interesting points to remember is that with any intelligence area, all intelligence oper- ates on a need-to-know basis. And here were two men, highly placed in their intelli- gence/security roles, but who had previ- ously been told nothing about the UFO phe- nomenon at all. It was as new to them as it was to the officers at Roswell when the thing crashed in their midst. They had to improvise from the beginning and they had no information to go by, so they were in the same boat as the rest of us were. Actually worse off in certain senses. Q: When I read over and over how you had to drop these tape recordings off at what was called a \"drop\"—that definitely was fa- miliar from gangster and spy movies . .. Hopkins: Yeah. But it was the only way to do it. I mean, they refused to do a post of- fice box, and if I wanted to get something to them and if they were refusing a post of- fice box and I had no address, then a drop is the only other way out. Q: Do you still have the ring that you were given? Hopkins: Yes."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Q: I'd like to learn more about the Mickey/Baby Ann syndrome. You said in the book that after discovering this aspect of abduction in the Cortile case, it turned up repeatedly in a few other cases as well. Is it possible that you and other researchers are making these discoveries on a planned, timed-release basis that is partially under the aliens' control? Once a phenomenon turns up, then there seems to be an orga- nized pattern where it recurs. Hopkins: Well, that's certainly a very good point. And it's certainly a possibility. It's a very, very hard thing to learn. You see, this is the problem about this: At every step of the way, UFO researchers have been infi- nitely more conservative than daring or wide-ranging in their approach to the sub- ject. Mainly because we didn't want to seem \"wild-eyed,\" leading and so forth. So, there have probably been over the years many hints of this phenomenon which, when we heard about them, we simply went right on by them. I know that after \"Missing Time\" came out in 1981, and I was besieged with cases, that often people described a sexual aspect of their experience. I'd first began to notice these cases in the 70s. I mean, a man might have said \"I think they were doing something to my penis.\" But when those things would come up, I would simply pass them by. I asked no further questions, I ex- plored it no further. It was unpleasant, and I'd just assume, \"Well, they're just explor- ing the whole human anatomy.\" And of course, once I learned the reproductive as- pect of this phenomenon, then whenever these remarks or hints came up, I was smart enough, or at least quick enough on the up- take, to ask some follow-up questions. And I think exactly the same thing is happening with this as with many other aspects of this phenomenon once we hear something even suggested in passing, now that we know that it does relate to a certain pattern, we're smart enough at least to ask a few follow-up questions and to try and find out a little bit more about it. It could be a'matter of our own previous dimness, then, as one of the aliens parceling stuff out on a timed basis. Either one could be a contributing factor. Q: You talked about the emotionally trau- matic repercussions that sometimes result from this controlled pairing of people. For instance, in the book there's all the drama and indecision over who fathered the little boy. But have you discovered any beneficial effects as a result of this phenomenon? Hopkins: Well, I will say right now that, believe it or not, one couple who met in this bizarre way have recently gotten married and seem happily married. This happened very, very recently. So, we do have one pos- itive outcome. We have other cases where there's an enormous degree of ongoing sad- ness, however. So, I guess it depends a lot on the person's age and situation and mari- tal status when they finally discover one an- other in the real world. I suspect this is much more widespread than we thought. And see, again, the most interesting a'spect of this in terms of the credibility of the case is that the very first example of it was Linda Cortile. Q: So do you have a theory as to why the aliens need this particular kind of psycho- logical testing? How it serves them to pair people off and put them through all that testing and preparation? Hopkins: Well, I can make guesses. Obviously, when you speculate as to alien motives and what they need and so forth, you're always on shaky ground. But, as I say, in knowing what we know about the re- productive patterns here, what may be ge- netic engineering of some sort, and certainly the production of hybrids, the thing always to be remembered is that human beings are not fruit flies. And it takes generations for changes to take place and perhaps this is a way of speeding up the process, who knows? It's certainly a way in which they could leam by observation how human be- ings interact from the earliest time of their becoming acquainted with one another. Q: The co-opting scene, the scene on the beach, the \"Lady of the Sands\" thing, I don't know what specifically'to ask, it's al- most like a science-fiction cliche: \"the aliens took over my body.\" Hopkins: Exactly, exactly. No doubt about it. And it sounds that way. And of course it's a kind of a basic component of paranoia for a lot of people. You know, the gods made me do it, or Satan made me do it, or whatever it is. The voices made me do it. But the strange thing is that there's this tremendous remorse afterwards. And a tremendous sense of helplessness that a per- It's very hard for me to read an- other's mind and their in- tentions, but I would say anyone who advances very far in the world of poli- tics and diplomacy learns how to play their cards very, very close.

Let me just say this, that I feel extremely grateful for the support that I've had in the UFO com- munity, the research community, through all of the attacks that have been launched on me and on all of the various witnesses in this case. I feel a great deal of gratitude that people have waited to read the whole story before making up their minds.

Bob Guccione's Penthouse Alien T hey're billed on the cover of the September 1996 issue of Penthouse as the first authentic photos of an alien, accord- ing to editor and publisher Bob Guccione. \"[They] may well be the most important pictures in the history of photography,\" writes Keith Ferrell. former OMNI edtior, adding that only a photograph of Jesus Christ would be comparable. \"Had the government—and particularly military intelligence—known of [its] exis- tence ... before publication it would never have seen print.\" The picture is attributed to the daughter of a German scientist who escaped to America at the outset of World War II. \"How we got in touch with each other is our business,\" Guccione says but, \"I have ab- solutely no doubt that these pictures are genuine.\" To continue repeating statements from this fictional article is a travesty to the September  readers of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL 1 QQfi Number 341 What else can one expect from such a mag- Page 8  azine as Penthouse ? There is nothing fantastic about \"Bob Guccione's alien.\" Anyone who visits the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico, can photo- graph the same \"alien\" as I did last summer. It is on public display as a featured attrac- tion complete with a mannequin in surgical clothing, while the \"alien\" lies on a hospital gurney. This is actually the model used by the producers of the HBO film \"Roswell,\" directed by Paul J.

So I was quite pleased to see such an analysis by Dan Wright in the June 1996 MUFON UFO Journal. 2 1 strongly agree with Wright's recognition of this issue as one of central importance, and I applaud his effort in this direction. However, the inferences Wright draws from his tabulations require additional ex- amination. Specifically, he sees \"myriad correlations\" that no reasonable person could dismiss as merely \"massive coinci- dence.\" Consequently, without determining the statistical probabilities associated with these tabulations, he asserts that \"whatever the precise odds of such a high number of correlations occurring by chance alone, they are certainly astronomical.\" But in the ab- sence of actually knowing the odds, by what standard is \"chance\" to be determined? Wright's certainty notwithstanding, the yardstick for \"chance\" can never be subjec- tive impression, a measure that is often grossly inaccurate. Conflicts Between Subjective and Statistical Measures of Chance There are many aspects of statistical in- ference that underlie conflicts between sub- jective and statistical assessments of \"chance.\" I will discuss just three of the most common. The first stems from the fact that when dealing with human behavior, a priori probability cannot always be deter- mined from the number of response options alone. For example, if subjects are asked to \"pick a number between 1 and 10,\" contrary to \"common sense\" there is not an equal a priori probability of selection for each of the 10 possible answers. This is because re- sponse biases in the general population fa- vor picking the number \"three.\"Consider also a well publicized study from psychol- ogy. In this research, the backgrounds of identical twins — separated at birth and completely unaware of each other's exis- tence — were examined for \"commonal- ties.\" The analysis revealed numerous com- monalties that seem well beyond most indi- viduals' intuitive sense of \"chance.\" Yet other research found similar commonalties in a small sample of randomly paired col- lege students, suggesting no deviation from chance in the statistical sense, and hence no need for a special explanation for the twin findings. These examples illustrate that whether the response set is known in advance (as with a set of numbers) or unknown (as with abduction narrative content), normative hu- man behavior must be assessed to determine the theoretical expected response frequen- cies. A second aspect of conflict between sub- jective and statistical measures of \"chance\" has to do with cumulative probability. Consider the frequently cited \"birthday problem.\" 3 How likely does it seem that in a group of just 23 people, two will have the same birthday? Intuitively, this seems very unlikely (perhaps even \"certainly astronom- ical\"), but the odds turn out to be 50/50 (.5). And in a room of just 35 people, the proba- bility is .85. This is because of cumulative probability. The odds for any two people picked at random having the same birthday is only about 1 in 365 (very unlikely). But that is true for every pair of people, so the odds of some birthday occurring twice for some pair of individuals in the group is re- lated to the cumulative probability for every possible pair of individuals. Cumulative probability is something that intuition rarely takes into account. A third source of conflict between intu- itive and statistical inference relates to the issue of replicability, and stems from the fact that random processes will sometimes produce apparently non-random (beyond- chance) outcomes. A \"fluke\" outcome, which may look impressive in isolation, will be revealed as a fluke only through repeated testing.

September 1996 Number 341 Page 10 But there is another aspect of this prob- lem. Let's say we find an impressive set of commonalties among one group of abduc- tion reports. Then, in examining a second set of abduction reports we find a com- pletely different set of commonalties. Does this add to or detract from the argument that narrative consistency demonstrates nar- rative veridicality? An unsophisticated (in- tuitive) approach to these data might sug- gest that the collective result strengthens the argument of veridicality, because addi- tional commonalties were found. However, if abduction reports accurately describe similar events, the same commonalties should be reported across different sets of abduction reports. The collective result in this example is actually more consistent with a random process at work, reflecting only the a priori probabilities for finding some (as opposed to any particular) com- monalties. Without control experiments and replica- tion it is easy to misinterpret any single out- come, non-chance or otherwise. This is why control and replication are foundations of the scientific method, and why, in their ab- sence, scientists reserve acceptance of novel findings (even in the most mundane areas of research). DETERMINING \"CHANCE\" FOR ABDUCTION REPORT CONTENT As Martin Gardner 3 has noted, \"Estimating the probability that a hidden law is at work behind a series of apparent coincidences is a difficult task, and statisti- cians have developed sophisticated tech- niques for doing so\" (p. 110). As discussed, these techniques must address the issues of a priori probability, cumulative probability, and replication. In the case of abduction narrative consistency, this process must start with a control experiment in which abduc- tion narratives are \"made up\" by a popula- tion of subjects screened for the absence of abduction experience histories, but other- wise selected at random. Because a properly conducted experiment of this kind has not yet been carried out, an evaluation of the data Wright describes remains a matter of subjective impression, not statistical infer- ence. Nevertheless, a post hoc analysis of Wright's findings may be a useful exercise in examining the validity of subjective im- pression. This can be done making no as- sumptions whatever, and with virtually no mathematical sophistication. The database for Wright's analysis con- sists of approximately 2000 \"case factors\" reported across 216 cases. Of these, Wright identified 68 case factors he regards as \"ob- scure\" and which appear in at least 4 differ- ent cases (i.e., were selected by Wright as evidence of \"consistency\"). Accordingly, we can ask: what a priori probability of oc- currence must exist for a case factor to ap- pear in 4 out of 216 cases purely by chance? The answer is 1/54. That is, an abduction report \"factor\" mentioned by only 1 in every 54 control subjects would be expected to be mentioned by 4 out of every 216 sub- jects purely by chance. But how likely is it to find as many as 68 such factors among 2000? The calculation of this is actually fairly involved, and can- not be described in a way that is easily re- lated to \"intuition.\" Instead, I suggest the reader consider that only 1 out of every 30 (68/2000) or so case factors (29.4 to be ex- act) need meet Wright's criterion of \"com- monalty\" to account for the finding he ob- tained. I leave it to the reader to decide if this outcome seems \"astronomically\" be- yond chance. • |k|the same way, we can examine the 11 almost extreme commonalties Wright reports. He identifies 9 items of content that occurred \"in as many as 20 cases.\" The a priori probability needed for a factor to oc- cur in 20 out of 216 cases purely by chance is 1 in 10.8 (on average, such an item would have to be mentioned by one in every 10 or 11 control subjects). Unlike the previous sit- uation, this may seem a rather high a priori probability of occurrence for factors catego- rized as \"obscure.\" However, Wright appar- ently defined \"obscure\" in terms of a fac- tor's mention in the media (\"books, maga- zines, or TV programs\"), not by its intrinsic properties. Thus, a repeated mention of gloves, gurneys, fingernails, examining- table restraining straps, flashlight-like de- vices, and other not-so-improbable objects are pointed to as examples of highly im- probable commonalties. In any case, even with this finding (Wright's most extreme example) only one such factor need exist for every 222 in the MUFON database to ac- count for the 9 factors Wright reports. As mentioned before, these numbers are not based on assumptions, intuition, or subjective impression. They derive entirely"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL from the reported outcomes themselves. In the absence of actually determining the a priori probabilities associated with these outcomes, the reader, like Wright, will have to decide their significance in terms of subjective impression. But strictly in nu- merical terms, it is at least an exaggeration to characterize them as \"certainly astro- nomical.\" INTERPRETING DEPARTURES FROM \"CHANCE\" In making statistical inferences, there is another problem lurking behind that of ac- curately determining \"chance.\" Even if a set of data cannot be attributed to chance, what they can be attributed to may still be un- clear. That is, a non-chance outcome only precludes a random event. It does not, in it- self, identify the cause of the event. Commendably, Wright mentions some al- ternative explanations for beyond-chance consistencies in abduction experiences (e.g., psychological and sleep disorders), if only to dismiss them as inconsistent with the phenomenology of the abduction experi- ence. However, there remain methodologi- cal issues which could account for the con- sistencies he reports. For example, the 216 case studies were obtained from 17 investigators, an average of about 13 cases per investigator. Therefore, considerable opportunity existed for each investigator to influence content within the block of abduction narratives he or she obtained. Similarly, interactions be- tween investigators create opportunities for shared information which, in turn, could af- • feet consistency across investigators. Interactions among the experiencers them- selves create additional opportunities for ab- duction report content to be shared. Finally, the use of transcripts from repeated hypno- sis sessions on the same experiencers (Wright notes that the 216 cases generated 766 tapes, so repeated sessions were appar- ently quite common) exacerbates the poten- tial for shared information to find its way into abduction narratives over time. Because each of these situations may al- low factors unfamiliar to the media to be- come familiar to abduction researchers and experiencers, Wright's fundamental premise of factor \"obscurity\" is potentially compro- mised. There are other issues that impact the in- terpretation of the data, but I do not wish to belabor the point. It is not my intent to- demonstrate that the obtained commonalties are indeed an artifact of investigator influ- ence, just that they could be. And in the ab- sence of evidence (not simply argument) to the contrary, interpreting the results of the database as proof of alien visitation is by no means necessary even if the results were un- questionably beyond chance. SCIENCE AND UFOLOGY Lest my remarks be misinterpreted, I want to emphasize that they are not an at- tack on the \"alien\" explanation per se. They address only the data presented in Wright's article, not all data and all arguments which bear on this explanation of abduction expe- riences. I also want to repeat that Wright's contributions to the MUFON abduction transcription project are to be commended and appreciated. This is hard work, and nei- ther the methodological problems inherent to the database nor the limitations in inter- pretability due to the absence of control ex- periments can be attributed to Wright. These are problems to be addressed by others in the field. N evertheless, on some of the most funda- mental grounds of statistical inference and scientific procedure, the tabulations Wright presents do not, as he would have it, lead inexorably to the \"reasonable ... very simple conclusion [that these] experiences were real, were accurately reported, and in- volved the same group of entities.\" Although this explanation may ultimately be shown to account for the consistencies Wright reports, such a conclusion is hardly the straight-forward automatic supposition he describes. And to interpret scientists' caution in accepting this conclusion as evi- dence of their \"herd mentality\" or their be- ing \"plainly afraid to contemplate... intelli- gences higher than their own\" is unfair and uninformed, amounting to no more than the skeptics' characterization of ufologists as just a bunch of gullible fools. It is also strategically unwise. Ufologists who are serious about establishing a rap- prochement with the scientific community (I realize that many are not) must under- stand that research findings will be accepted as true anomalies only if they have been ob- tained, analyzed, and presented according to the rules of science. This means running controlled experiments where possible, car- Even if a set of data can- not be attrib- uted to chance, what they can be attributed to may still be unclear. That is, a non- chance out- come only precludes a random event. It does not, in itself, identify the cause of the event.

While it may be reasonable to criticize sci- entists for demanding more from ufology than they do from other areas of inquiry, it is unreasonable to criticize them for refus- ing to settle for less. Accordingly, concerned ufologists should stop demanding acceptance from the scien- tific community (or carping about not hav- ing it) and start earning it. The data Dan Wright is tabulating may be a step in that di- rection. But it is far from the complete jour- ney, and sidetrips down avenues of exclam- atory rhetoric and ad hominem criticism will only extend that journey further. Dan Wright Replies Dan Wright is the Manager of MUFON's Abduction Transcription Project. He has con- tributed numerous articles to the MUFON UFO Journal over the years. September 1996 Number 341 Page 12 T he opportunity to respond to Stuart Appelle's critique of my article, \"Sorting Entities,\" in the June 1996 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal is appreciated. Dr. Appelle's remarks concerning the poten- tial for statistical significance in the find- ings I presented are well taken. In turn, some clarifications are in order and hope- fully will place his criticisms in proper con- text. A full accounting has revealed that, for the 216 abduction-related cases used in the article, there were 2,174 separate recorded factors, an average of 10.1 descriptive fac- tors introduced for each case. [In actuality, of course, some cases revealed many new factors, others few or none.] The mean average mentions of those 2,174 factors in all 216 cases would be ar- duous to compile. However, it may be in- structive to cite the frequency of some of the more well known: Levitation of the sub- ject was recalled in 104 cases; a grey- skinned entity in 76; oversized entity eyes in 96; laying on an examining table in 108; a being's reassurance (e.g., \"We will not hurt you.\") in 85; and use of a needled in- strument in 53 cases. It was in the knowledge of commonali- ties such as these that I chose 68 \"odd\" fac- tors (i.e., rarely if ever mentioned in print or electronic media). A hundred more could have been selected had time permitted. Some thoughts on these obscurities that were not part of Dr. Appelle's observations: First, likening mentions of the odd fac- tors to finding duplicate birthdates in a crowd is to mix different fruits in the bas- ket. There are, after all, only 366 possible birthdates, so with each one selected the odds against a \"hit\" do decrease. In contrast, every person under hypnosis is free to men- tion anything. The potential universe is not just 2,174 factors; in fact it is infinite. That several subjects recalled specifics such as a railing or raised platform within a room on- board, therefore, might indeed be signifi- cant. Dr. Appelle's second serious oversight is to ignore the very foundation of my paper. For at no point does he ever address the cor- relations of odd factors, instead preferring to brush aside individual characteristics. For example, randomness does suggest that in- valid cases might occasionally and coinci- dentally share mention of a \"flashlight\" (i.e., rod-like instrument with a glowing tip) or an examining table raised and lowered. But as I posed in the paper, what would be the chance of multiple cases among the 216 sharing several of those obscure details? In that an odd factor appears on average in only one case out of nineteen (11.6 out of 216), the odds against random chance quickly escalate when more are added. Even if we ignore the infinite range of possible characteristics, the chance that any two fac- tors are shared by two separate cases is, for • simplicity, 19 x 19/215, or 1.68 to 1. For three factors shared by two cases, the sim- plified formula is 19 x 19 x 197 215, or about 32 to 1. As a fourth, fifth, six, seventh and even eighth factor is added to the mix, the chance of just two cases having such commonalities randomly is very high in- deed. That said, I was not comparing merely two cases at most points in the paper. Perhaps Dr. Appelle missed my statement, \"... nine pairs of cases (10 cases in total) each have seven of the odd factors in com- mon.\" And shortly thereafter, \"... eight pairs of cases in the study have eight of the 68 obscure characteristics in common.\" One does not need an advanced mathematics de- gree to realize that the odds against random-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ness in that context are certainly astronomi- cal. The third major oversight in Dr. Appelle's critique is to ignore my compari- son of odd-factor correlations with the find- ings earlier in the paper of four primary characteristics: entity height, skin tone, gar- ment type and garment color. Once again, multiple cases with numerous shared odd factors were also tied together in detailed terms of entities' physical descriptions. The sum of these separate sets of findings even further lengthens the odds against chance testimony. I have been reserving a full-blown statis- tical analysis for a point when we have closer to 500 cases in the database. However, if my esteemed colleague has a competent statistician in mind willing to work with the available data, an arrange- ment can surely be reached. As sidebars, Dr. Appelle remarked that individual CE-4 subjects might trade ac- counts and thereby influence one another and that abduction researchers might also share what to look for. In that abductee sup- port groups are now commonplace, experi- encer contamination is possible to some ex- tent. But since the subjects are coast-to- • coast, and because most insist on anonymity, one may not presume fairly that, on anything approaching a wide scale, the details of abduction events are traded and then bleed through into consciousness under hypnosis. That would discount both the strictures for discussion in many support groups and the tenets of regressive hypno- sis. Moreover, a majority of the abduction re- searchers in the Project are not even famil- iar with one another. If it were not clear to Dr. Appelle or others, there is a very strong commitment to confidentiality held by all the hypnosis practitioners. Without prior ap- proval of their clients, they simply do not share details of the accounts. Finally, I wish to address Dr. Appelle's concern over my so-called \"ad hominem\" challenge to the larger science establish- ment. While I applaud his editorship of the Journal of UFO Studies and its overture to the broader community of entrenched physi- cal scientists, I would point out that they have had half a century to climb aboard. To ignore a UFO reality at this point is to turn a deaf ear to the many thousands of multiple- witness reports, documented physical ef- fects, and government documents uncov- ered. Frankly, MUFON has enough profes- sional scientists to do the work in store. To the rest I can only say the train has already left the station; catch up if you choose. We no longer wring our hands when an astronomer justifies the account of a struc- tured vehicle at close range as Venus. And we are way beyond the need to prove to them that alien abductions occur on a regu- lar basis. It is our good fortune that MU- FON adds a dose of common sense to its in- vestigative practices, an element many sci- entists could surely use. From my intimate knowledge of its data- base, short of a watershed case the Abduction Transcription Project will never provide undeniable proof. Instead, we have a firm base of correlated testimony. Hence, we are now ready to go beyond the square- one IF question (i.e., \"if abductions occur\") to determining what these multiple groups of entities are up to. Adhering to a strict sci- entific method of organizing control groups to fabricate abduction stories, replicating<al- ready solid findings and so forth must be balanced with the need to move on. I might be impressed by Dr. Appelle's lecture on probabilities were he to address the sum of the parts I originally presented. The correlations in my article constituted an intellectually honest effort. I am at a loss to explain a response which flails at isolated factors, then questions my conclusions as if they were based on individual pieces rather than the whole.

I also thought that MUFON was still essentially an American organization, and that American investigators must be well ahead of the rest of the world in knowing about UFO data and knowing how to investigate properly. This smug nationalistic attitude has been common among many Americans who have never really talked to investigators from other countries and learned what a wealth of fascinating information exists without any publicity or fanfare. These case files in other countries also extend back to the 1940s as well. Yet, Americans might natu- rally assume (as I had initially) that they were probably poorly investigated and therefore unreliable or probably influenced by rumor and hysteria. Another aspect which sadly obscures or diminishes the in- ternational knowledge base is that some of the speakers are not dynamic and labor un- der the constraints of language barriers as well, thereby presenting an unpolished or questionable image to American audiences. But as 1, too, learned to give my presenta- tions through simultaneous, on-stage trans- lators, 1 found that the shine, polish, and oc- casional humor in my presentations also disappeared because the focus had shifted to simply getting the most serious and basic information translated. Therefore, Americans have been content to basically travel about the United States, collecting American accounts from American re- searchers and feeling that they are \"up to date\" on all UFO research. This was the same naive attitude that blinded me to the quality, depth, and dedica- tion of other researchers and \"in-the- trenches\" investigators in other countries. In fact, many American investigators could learn some valuable perspectives, ap- .proaches, and innovative ideas from foreign researchers. Unknown to nearly all Americans is the fact that Brazil, South America, has 181 UFO groups in over 102 different cities! Some of these dedicated in- vestigators have been in the field for 30-40 years. Irene Granchi, author of UFOs and Abductions in Brazil, is a legend in her own country, having performed research for about 50 years. Psychologist Gilda Moura has worked with approximately 50 ab- ductees and has been studying brain scans to correlate any findings possibly related to abduction trauma. Most of her important work is unknown to the world. I was fortunate to have witnessed a top level, national meeting of Brazilian re- searchers while in Curitiba. I was so im- pressed with their dedication, sincerity, en- thusiasm, and concern for UFO research be- ing conducted properly. They are not inter- ested in all the hysterical conspiracy theo- ries running rampant in the United States. The reports of captured beings in Varginha is a most serious case under careful investi- gation. I was impressed by these events.and report on them in my new research video re- garding this case. Just 10 days later I was speaking again in South America on the other coast at the First International UFO Conference in Santiago, Chile. Again I was impressed by not only the years of experience of some of the Chilean investigators, but also the wealth of case material that is practically unknown to Americans. Did you know that a UFO crashed in the desert of North Chile in 1993 — and that bodies and debris were recovered? Did you know that the United States had been involved? Did you know that Japan supposedly bought pieces of the wreckage for study? The source is a high- ranking military man that the investigators are carefully courting. The conference itself was held at a university and attended by doctors, psychologists, professors, journal- ists, and other professionals. The tone was serious, skeptical, scientific, and mature. Commercialism and fanaticism were both noticeably absent. Italy boasts a strong tradition in UFO re- search led by the vivacious dedication of Roberto Pinotti, a veteran of UFO science for at least 30 years who knew J. Allen Hynek well. Pinotti organizes conferences in Italy and edits two polished publications, UFO and Alieni. To not know Roberto is to not know a strong slice of UFO history. Also publishing a top-notch, slick publica- tion from England, entitled UFO Magazine, is Graham Birdsall, a straight-forward, fact- seeking gentleman who searches for the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL lastest UFO data worldwide with youthful enthusiasm and professional dedication. He has been giving England an ongoing series of respectable conferences with quality speakers such as Stanton Friedman and Graham Hancock (Fingerprints of the Gods). Birdsall recently reported that huge triangular-shaped crafts were seen rising from the waters surrounding England by fishermen. I had the honor of working with Mr. Birdsall and Stanton Friedman in Brazil when we three interviewed chief investiga- tor Vitorio Pacaccini concerning the Varginha case (included in my video). In the Netherlands, therapist Hilda Musch has been collecting important data on abductions as evidenced by several re- ports shared with me. One subject described an implant being inserted up the nose after a staring procedure at close range into the eyes. Another case described the presenta- tion of a hybrid child in some kind of labo- ratory setting. These people had had practi- cally no exposure to any abduction litera- ture at all according to Hilda. • |U| Australia, experienced investigator I 111 Keith Basterfield told me about a case in which an Australian woman described an abduction with many classic details, includ- ing being asked to hold a strange-looking baby in a nursery setting — and describing a hybrid creation in the same detailed way that Americans have for several years. Basterfield stated that this woman had had no exposure to any abduction material — and that not many UFO books make it eas- ily to Australia anyway. Also in Brisbane, Australia is hypnotherapist Glennys Mackay, organizer of the upcoming interna- tional UFO conference in Brisbane, October 11-13. She has worked with abductees care- fully over several years now and relates the following encounter: \"A married couple, both university grad- uates who run their own business in New South Wales, were traveling with their two children when they encountered a blinding flash of light and 45 minutes of missing time. Under hypnosis, they described the abductors as being two meters tall in a hov- ering spaceship. They were placed on a table, samples of blood and skin were taken from their bodies as they lay unable to move. They claimed there were four differ- ent types of aliens present, including a lizard-like humanoid. The aliens communi- cated telepathically, telling them that their lives were not in danger. She experienced severe stomach pains; he developed a golf ball-size blister on his right toe. Both had red dots on the back of their necks. \"Under hypnosis, husband reports, 'Our car is stopped by the side of the road and I am slumped over the steering wheel. We are surrounded by a group of aliens. Two are carrying my wife off into the field, they are extremely tall with no visible coloring; their faces look like giant-size ants and moths. They are talking to me, but no words are coming out. They tell me not to be afraid. They want samples. I look up and see a large spacecraft hovering over my head. Now I am lying on a table inside the craft. I am screaming and crying and pleading with them to let me go. A large thick piece of plastic is wrapped around my waist. Later, a large steel rod is drilled into my right eye — but it's a strange sensation with no pain. My body is raised off the table, and I am sus- pended in mid-air. A piece of wire is placed inside me. I can feel it touching and scrap- ing my spinal cord. I'm overcome with a feeling of warmth.' \"His wife reports, 'I am on a table. There are a lot of strange faces looking at me. They look like they're wearing ice-hockey masks. There is a dome ceiling and lots of windows. I feel cold but no discomfort. The last thing I remember is being carried to the car.'\" I hope to interview a number of ab- ductees in Australia when I speak for their conference. I will present these findings in a later column. There is much going on in the world that we do not really hear about eas- ily. Dr. John Mack is also helping to gather such international data as he is making a documentary regarding the conscious, day- light sighting of a UFO and two beings by 62 sincere and credible schoolchildren in Africa. We must stop to realize there is a gold mine of quality information out there in the world. We should pay our respects to the quiet but dedicated efforts of our international colleagues, who hold vital pieces of this UFO mystery. In the future, they shall try to be heard over the noisy clatter of American ufology. We should be looking more fre- quently beyond our own boundaries if we are to effectively understand this endless enigma. \"Our car is stopped by the side of the road and I am slumped over the steering wheel.

Pflock F asnvalker might have been an entertain- ing novel. It might even have been an in- teresting work of \"ufological\" nonfiction. But the author seems never to have been able to decide what it was to be, and the publisher appears to have been equally torn, labeling it \"F1CTION/UFOLOGY.\" When I pick up what purports to be a novel (says so, right here on the cover), I expect an entertaining read, a story which compels me to suspend my disbelief at least for the duration, which drags me in by the lapels on the first page and sweeps me along right through the last paragraph. If I get anything else from it—enlightenment, knowledge, food for thought—that's a bonus which must flow naturally from the story, characterizations, and action. To bor- row a line from my old and dear friend, the late and very great science fictioneer Robert Heinlein, a fiction writer's first duty is to entertain—the rest, if any, is gravy. Jacques Vallee is not the first nor, alas, will he be the last author to violate this car- dinal rule of word-carpentry. Ayn Rand and, yes, even Robert Heinlein, come immedi- ately to mind. But Fasnvalker is the most recent unfortunate example of such to land on my desk. A rework of Vallee's French-language Alintel. published in France in 1986, the Americanization and action of Fast\\\\>alker seem almost entirely to be attributable to borrowings from Tracy Torme\" s screenplay, on which Vallee notes he leaned heavily.

Also along for the ride, now and again, is Doctor Helmut Borodine, televangelist, grand po- tentate of the Brotherhood of Galactic Science—a flying-saucer religious cult— and, as it turns out, still another victim of amoral aliens (?Vamoral agents of the Secret Government (?)/both (?)—not to mention he's the most interesting and fully realized character in the book (even if he and his scam [?] owe more than a little to the Church of All Worlds in Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Lund). With the assistance (?) of various and sundry spear carriers—most of whom clearly were plucked from the Home for Retired Saturday Matinee Extras—the intre- pid trio try to penetrate the UFO mystery, to learn the truth behind the flying saucers. This takes place against an occasionally glimpsed background of a World in Crisis: the entire population of Mexico is threaten- ing to cross the border en masse but refuse to pick field crops when they get here, Russia is about to go to war with Ukraine, militiamen are on the march, the Energizer Bunny is on strike, etc. (All this, by the way, is merely by the way—a flicker in and out backdrop—and we never learn—or care—if anyone anywhere gets raped, pil- laged, or incinerated.)

With me so far? It turns out (surprise) truth closely resembles Vallee's messen- gers-of-deception take on UFOs and possi- bly related manifestations. Here Vallee seems to be attempting to stuff absolutely everything anyone ever claimed or wanted to believe about such things into this \"it ain't what it seems\" framework. It's all here: abductions, CEs of every imaginable kind, underground bases, Area 51 (more convenient to the Las Vegas strip than any- one other than Bob Lazar could have guessed), contactees, angels (?), demons (?), crop circles, benign (?) Intelligences from somewhere/-when, power-mad generals and insiders and outsiders of all sorts (I must confess, it is fun figuring and trying to fig- ure out which Famous Ufologists/Spooks/ef al certain characters are standing in for). Name it, it's here. And in an attempt to make sure the reader grasps how all this fits into the overarching \"ufological\" context, Vallee follows the example of Jules Verne, setting up various awkward expository scenes through which the reader must suffer as the book's characters babble on to and at each other about things which (mostly) they would have to know already or likely wouldn't give a hoot about if they didn't. Yawn. In the end ... well, I don't want to spoil things for those with the fortitude to stick this one out to the end. Vallee is one of the most important fig- ures in UFO research. He has made many significant contributions to the field and doubtless will continue to do so. While 1 have considerable difficulty with most of his key current interpretations of the data, he is a thoughtful and provocative re- searcher whose ideas are always stimulating and worth considering. But if you're looking for entertainment with a UFO angle, Fasnvalker the book is not the place to look. Wait for the movie. Jf, as seems likely, it is produced from a Tracy Torme script, it is bound to be rip-roaring good fun. Bottom line: Buy Fasnvalker only if you're a completist and you must have it for your UFO-book collection and/or you can't resist the fun of guessing which character stands for whom in the \"ufological\" pan- theon.

The pe- riod covered was an extraordinary time for ufology, beginning with the famous Levelland, Texas, case and ending with the closing of Project Blue Book, a week after the last entry. As might be expected from a diary, Vallee's view here of UFOs, the Air Force, and certain prominent ufologists, is a personal and intimate one. It's also interna- tional in scope, as Vallee's UFO research and personal life take him from France to Austin, Chicago. Moscow, and points be- tween.

Forbidden Science is almost a nostalgic walk down memory lane, as well as a timely warning that those who ignore history are almost certainly consigned to repeat it. If you're new to the field, or merely in need of a re- fresher course, read this book and try to re- member why you became interested in UFOs in the first place. t the arguable opposite end of the UFO spectrum is the second collaboration by author Kim Carlsberg and artist Darryl Anka from Bear & Co. Publishing out of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The first was Beyond My Wildest Dreams: Diary of a UFO Abductee, in which Carlsberg, then still photographer for the popular TV series Baywatch, recounted her own UFO experi- ences. That volume had the virtue of being handsomely illustrated by Darryl Anka, whose art is literally out of this world. September 1996 Number 341 Page 18 I'd like to be as charitable about Contact Cards: An Extraterrestrial Divination System, but I honestly can't. Anka's art is still mostly to be admired — as art — but it's hard to put much stock in this set's card- board cover blurb that \"Anka is also ac- claimed internationally as the channel of Bashar, an extraterrestrial being, known for his practical teachings on moving beyond limitations.\" Not on my block he's not. The set consists of 60 three-and-a-half- inch square cards divided into five cate- gories of 12 cards each: Aliens (with red borders). Ships (purple), Stars (yellow), Planets (blue), and Circles (green). The kind of symbols we're dealing with here can be gleamed from the two accompanying exam- ples. Each card has a specific meaning and interpretation attached to it which appear in the accompanying 275-page hardback in- struction manual authored by Carlsberg, leaving one to wonder if Bashar, who would presumably be more informed, were on summer sabbatical. The cards are suppos- edly employed in a manner similar to the tarot and other divination systems. Whatever. Curiously, given the vast variety and complexity of crop circle art displayed over the last few years, the symbols adorning the Circles set here are wan by comparison, the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL least imaginative and impressive of all the cards. And the prose doesn't fare much bet- ter. Here, for example, is an excerpt from one of the Circle cards, the \"Sun God\": \"Resplendent and glorious am I, the Sun God, who casts beneficent rays of light and life and dispels the shadows of the night. \"I inspire new growth and am the driving engine for the changing seasons. I assert my aureate presence through every window that is opened to greet the dawn. \"Rise and shine! Action is the order of the day. I am Helios, whose fiery chariot leads the way. My incandescence illumi- nates the farthest horizons and reveals each rise, fall and bend of the journey's path.\" The Egyptians and Zoroastrians were writing better Sun hymns several thousand years ago. You'd think with all that experi- ence under his belt that Bashar could have come up with something a little more pol- ished, poetic and profound. A |JL| ^%speaking of poetry and profun- f\\t il l^dity, there's New Lands by Charles Fort, the second in an ambitious pa- perback series by Fortean Times of England to revise and reprint the collected works consisting of four far-ranging books of Charles Fort, sometimes referred to as the father of modern ufology and most every- thing else weird and the least bit unusual. (He was born in 1874 and died in 1932.) Let me get my minor cavils and com- plaints out of the way early. First, the print is too damn small for someone of my gener- ation with aged eyes, rendering the pages crowded and somewhat hard to read. In turn, this leads to a significant discrepancy in page numbering from Fort's collected books as first published by Henry Holt (1941) and later reprinted by Dover (1974). No longer can one simply reference, say, Fort, page 767. The good news is that this is the first cor- rected version of New Lands to appear in the 73 years since its original publication in 1923, same being supplied by Mr. X of Canada. Also new is the Introduction by Jerome Clark and the excellent index by Steve Moore of Fortean Times (which is in even smaller type). The title, as Clark points out, comes from Ralph Waldo Emerson's 1838 essay on Nature: \"There are new lands, new men, new thoughts.\" But even here Fort isn't oth- erwise completely original or unique; shortly before the turn of the century H.G. Wells had already authored his classic tale of Martian invasion, War of the Worlds. What Fort would emphasize is that a whole host of \"New Lands\" lies out there just be- yond our ken and current knowledge, the tacit implication being that this would al- ways be the case. Put another way: Fort was fundamentally opposed to \"end solutions,\" especially when they prohibited by procla- mation both alternative theories and the in- troduction of new data. It was Fort's con- tention that data, any data, which didn't conform to existing paradigms was simply excluded, or \"damned,\" out of hand, hence the title of his first book. The Book of the Damned (1919). How prescient was Fort? Consider this off-hand remark (Chapter 9, p. 129, this edi- tion) which first appeared in print some three-quarters of a century ago: \"That all lu- minous objects that are seen in the sky when the planet Venus is nearest may not be Venus; may not be fire-balloons.\" This is one of the classics of the field before there was such a field. At $24 it's not cheaply priced, but then neither is the above item. On the other hand, if I had a choice between channeling Bashar or Fort. I'd choose Fort every time. Peace.

CROP CIRCLES REPORT In the summer of 1992, Project Argus investigated one of the most remarkable mysteries of the century, the sudden and baffling appearance of hundreds of huge, magnificent shapes—dubbed \"crop circles\"—in the fields of England each summer. Made of grain flattened methodically to the ground in intricate patterns, they were a form of landscape art which quickly attracted worldwide attention. But the \"artist\" was unknown. Where did they come from? What agent or force rou- tinely generated them overnight? Could they be products of something other than human activity? It seemed ap- propriate to seek to answer such questions with the in- struments and methods of science. Everyone interested in the study of the crop circle phenomenon should have a copy of the Report on the Results of Project Argus: An Instrumented Study of the Physical Materials of Crop Circles, edited by Michael Chorost, in 1993.

Webb October 1996 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter (-2.1), in Sagittarius, can be seen in the S at dusk then advancing westward until it sets in the WSW soon after 10 PM daylight time in mid-October. Find it below the Moon on the 18th. Saturn (0.6), in Pisces, stands in the E at dusk and moves westward during the night. The gas giant is below the Moon on October 23. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mercury's best morning appearance of the year occurs during early October. Despite this, the nearest planet to the Sun still is difficult to pick out. Use binoculars. It is low in the E at twi- light about 24° to the lower left of Venus. Venus (-4.1) rises in the E about 3:30 AM. The blazing planet approaches and passes the star Regulus during the 1st week of October. Venus can be seen one-half degree above the star on the 3rd and one-half degree below it on the 4th. Then the cres- cent Moon approaches and passes the pair from the 7th to the 9th. Mars (1.3). moving from Cancer to Leo, rises in the ENE af- ter 1:30 AM, ascending to the SE by dawn. The reddish world approaches and passes Regulus during the last week of the month, being only 1.2° apart on October 29. Saturn sets in the W as morning twilight begins. Partial Solar Eclipse: On October 12 extreme northern Maine is the only place in the U.S. to experience a small partial eclipse of the Sun. Around 8:30 AM the Moon appears to \"nick\" the solar disc and even- tually covers a maximum of less than 5% of the Sun's diam- eter. It is all over about 3/4 of an hour after it begins. Farther N and E in Canada somewhat more of the Sun will be hidden. For safe viewing, project the solar image through a binocular or telescope eyepiece (or a pinhole in a card) onto a white sur- face. Do not look through these instruments (or the pinhole) at the Sun! Meteor Shower: Radiating from the warrior Orion's upraised club in the south- ern sky, the Orionid meteors peak on the morning of the 21st at about 20 or so per hour. The absence of moonlight after 1 AM will aid in observing these mostly faint swift objects. But keep your eyes peeled for occasional bright fireballs as well. Moon Phases: Last quarter—October 4 New moon—October 12 First quarter—October 19 Full moon—October 26 September 1996 Number 341 Page 22 C o The Stars: Though it is increasingly hard to avoid light-polluted skies, October is a good month to try to find a sky dark enough to examine the dim silken ribbon of the Milky Way. This month it stretches from SW to NE. passing directly overhead in northern latitudes in the evening. The celestial river is the combined light of billions of stars too remote to be resolved with the unaided eye. Within its boundaries we find, from SW to NE, the constellations of Auriga the Chariot Driver, Perseus the Champion, Cassiopeia the Queen, Cepheus the King. Cygnus the Swan. Aquila the Eagle, and Sagittarius the Archer. Also there are many deep-sky objects of interest in the Milky Way which are accessible to telescope observers. UFO investigators should be aware of several IFO candi- dates near the horizon in the midevening October sky. The re- fracting or bending of light through turbulent layers of air and haze near the horizon may cause celestial objects to appear to move and change color, brightness, and shape. The low-alti- tude objects to look out for this month are Capella (NE). Aldebaran (ENE), Fomalhaut (SSE), Jupiter (SW). and Arcturus(WNW).

DAVID WEBB RESIGNS AS EASTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR David F. Webb was elected Eastern Regional Director on February I, 1994. On June 24, 1996, he asked to be relieved of this responsibility, since his job required a large amount of traveling and he was unable to process the UFO reports from the eastern region in a timely manner, creating a proverbial bottleneck. The Board of Directors understood the situation and reluctantly ac- cepted Mr. Webb's resignation. As David pointed out, the job responsibilities of the position are far more time- consuming than they were 20 years ago when he served in the same post. Until such time as a replacement is secured, all east- ern region State Directors should send their processed UFO sighting reports directly to the Deputy Director of Investigation, T. David Spencer, 6700 Woodcrest, Austin, TX 78759. MUFON is now seeking candidates to fill the unex- pired two-year term of Mr. Webb. Obviously, the inter- ested individuals must live in the eastern region of states to qualify. This is an opportunity for a State Director, Assistant State Director or State Section Director to as- sume greater responsibilities on the MUFON Board of Directors, since this is an elective office. People inter- ested should send a short letter to Walt Andrus enu- merating their education and experience to fill this im- portant post until the regular election in 1998. MEMBERSHIP AND FUND RAISING DIRECTORS As a result of the State/Provincial Director's Meeting and action taken by the MUFON Board of Director's Meeting in Greensboro, NC, two new vital positions were created on the Board in order to expand MU- FON's membership base and to seek out sources of fi- nancial help to promote additional research projects. For MUFON to continue its leading position in the field, it is imperative that these two important goals must receive priority attention. Financial contributions of this nature to a nonprofit corporation are tax exempt un- der the Internal Revenue Code. A person uniquely qualified in promotion, advertis- ing, group motivation and organizational team partici- pation is being solicited to become the Membership Director. An individual having proven fundraising tal- ents and experience with nonprofit organizations would make an ideal candidate for the position of Fund Raising Director. Interested people should submit a resume of their qualifications, education, and experience to Walt Andrus for the Board's consideration and evaluation. Every member of MUFON should be inviting prospective new members, however we need an orga- nized and formal program to achieve our membership goals. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAMS Anyone who has purchased and studied the 4th edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eligible to take the exam via mail when they feel they are ready. The 100-question test may be secured from MUFON headquarters in Seguin and returned to this office for grading. In localities where field investigator training classes are being conducted, the instructor may order sufficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the completion of the training classes. For current members, the new manual may be purchased for $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling from MUFON in Seguin.   '• Due to a vacancy on the MUFON Board of Directors for the position of Director for Field Investigator Training, we are seeking interested candidates. Please state your qualifications in a short letter and mail to Walt Andrus. MUFON NATIONAL UFO HOTLINE MUFON has been introducing its National UFO Hotline 1-800-UFO-2166 or 1-800-836-2166 to the public. Designed to obtain UFO sighting reports from police agencies nationwide, we are now prepared to expand its coverage. The majority of our calls, to-date, have been from people who called the 800 directory and asked for \"UFO\" to report sightings or to seek UFO informa- tion. To send letters to every police department and sher- iff's office throughout the U.S.A. would obviously be both expensive and time-consuming. We would like for every State Director, State Section Director, Field Investigator, and Field Investigator Trainee to notify your local sheriff, police chief, and state highway patrol office of MUFON's 800 number via a postcard that they may post on their bulletin boards or at the dis- patcher's desk. Presently, we are attempting to answer all calls \"live.\" An answering box records the calls received late at night or early mornings. These sighting reports will be mailed or telephoned to the nearest State Section Director, State Director, or Field Investigator for a per- sonal interview. Brief replies to these cases under in- vestigation may be made to MUFON on the 800 num- ber. (The answering box is limited to three minutes.) However, this number is not to be used for other MU- FON communications. The MUFON business office number is (210) 379-9216.
