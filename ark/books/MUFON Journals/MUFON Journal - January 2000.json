Hart MUFON Field Investigators, Missouri On a large cattle farm in Southern Missouri a small (9 ft. diameter) crop circle was formed in late July. Access to the property was gained in Septem- ber 1999, about seven weeks after the formation was discovered. At that time the circle was still entirely intact, being protected from cattle by an enclosure , and almost no rain had fallen since the formation. Unfortunately, sampling of the circle was delayed until mid-October, as these investigators were erro- neously informed that sampling had been performed by another investigator. As a result the downed veg- etation, mostly fescue, was not usable for sampling. However, successful sampling was done on green plants and soil samples within the circle and for a distance of more than 300 feet outside the circle. These samples continue to undergo laboratory test- ing. Preliminary laboratory reports told us that mag- netic particles were present in the soil samples, the quantity diminishing outward from the circle. When the laboratory gave us this information (personal com- munication by phone) another sampling was done. This time soil samples were taken for the sole pur- pose of recovering magnetic particles. Magnetic particles are frequently found in crop formations, but this circle varied somewhat from av- erage in that the magnetic particles were much larger than those commonly recovered. Usually the particles are from micron size (about 50 microns) to as large as 1mm. In the case of the Southern Missouri circle the particles were much larger. Some recovered par- ticles were of micron sizes, but more were very large, being as much as 2 mm in size (see cover photo). In October 1999 the circle was still intact except for slight damage done during the first sampling of soil and vegetation. There had been no rain run-off. To collect magnetic particles on the surface a very strong magnet covered by a plastic bag was used. The magnet was applied to the soil surface in measured areas, the particles collected from the surface being combined into a single sample. To recover embed- ded particles soil samples were removed from mea- sured areas to a depth of 1/4 inch and combined into a single sample. A control sample was taken approxi- mately 1000 feet from the circle. The surface particles were washed repeatedly with Crop circle where magnetic particles were found. distilled water, then dried under methanol, followed by absolute ethanol. The embedded particles were collected from the soil samples, combined, and washed in the same manner. Surface particles were weighed, and embed- ded particles weighed separately, then all were com- bined. There is no apparent difference between surface and subsurface material recovered. Some of the particles apparently simply hit with enough force to cause them to be embedded. The particles recovered are irregularly shaped, rounded globules that appear rusty to the naked eye. Under magnification by a microscope the particles ap- pear very much like slag, as would be found in the spray from a dirty cut made by an acetylene torch. Magnified, the particles are rusty, somewhat glazed, with the glazed areas being dark brown to black. They are quite smooth and appear to have melted, then cooled as a heavy spray. A rough calculation was made to reach an approxi- mate figure representing the quantity of magnetic mate- rial present in the circle to a depth of one-fourth inch. The result was a surprisingly large amount of material present. The surface of the circle is estimated to bear 53.1 gm (1.87 oz) of magnetic particles, while the em- bedded amount is estimated to be 212.36 gm (7.48 oz), with the total of surface and embedded material being an astounding 265 gm (over 9 oz). The control sample taken 1000 feet from the circle did not yield any magnetic particles at all. Addendum: It later came to our attention that five more circles had been formed in the area at about the same time, all five on a single farm within three-fourths mile of the circle sampled, Unfortunately they had been totally destroyed by a very large herd of cattle. The owner knew the approximate location of the circles, but no trace could be found."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 January 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Observation of UFOs by family continues By Eugene H. Prison Nova Scotia Provincial Director Editor's Note: This is a follow-up to Mr. Friden's account last month concerning his mother's 1970 close-up sighting of a UFO just outside their home (as well as his own sighting of the same object over a neighbor's house). The locale for these reports is the small village of Reserve Mines in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada. No more than a year after the sighting previ- ously described, I was standing in my mother's yard next to the small apple tree by the side of the house. It would have been about 7 or 8 p.m. with a twilight sky in the west. I observed a brilliant orange globe hovering approximately thirty degrees up from the horizon and about one-half mile away. It appeared to be BB size held at arm's length. After a minute or so, it started to move toward the north very slowly. It would stop and hover, then move again, repeating this maneuver several times. Then, during a period of hovering, there was a bril- liant orange flash from the object like it had violently exploded, but with absolutely no sound. The flash was dazzling, but completely silent. The object had vanished from where it was paused in the west, but instantly I noticed something out of the comer of my eye in the northern section of the sky (at the same elevation). I turned to discover what appeared to be the same object, only now it was a darkened reddish- purple color. It remained there a few minutes before gradually winking out. I don't know if it was receding into the distance or shrinking in brightness as it was paused, but it was soon gone. The whole episode lasted between fifteen to twenty minutes. I was utterly fascinated because it had apparently crossed almost half of the sky in an instant, and a person couldn't see it move. In the summer of 1976,1 witnessed a third display of unusual aerial activity. I was alongside the same tree, but this time prone on the ground with my head and chest area protruding from a small pup tent. I was staring up into the sky, and it was between 10 and 10:30 p.m. with not a single cloud. Without any sound, a huge golden cigar-shaped object shot over me traveling from north to south. It was perfectly symmetrical and had sharp, clearly defined edges, but also a thin mist around it. A banana straightened out and held at arm's length would be its appearance against the sky. Within five minutes, it zoomed overhead again at about the same speed and also in the direction of north to south. It seemed like it was moving along the exact same path it took on its first pass. I hadn't moved an inch. Staying flat on the ground, I waited to see if it would make a third pass, and within another five minutes it did so. However, this time it was moving south to north and seemed to be moving just a little slower. It also was not directly overhead as it was on the first two passes, being now more to my western side. On this third pass, it had changed color to a bright white and appeared to have a purplish glow (like a ball) at the trailing edge. I had been standing outside my mother's house for awhile prior to getting into the tent, but I had not seen anything until I was flat on the ground, so I'don't know if it had made any earlier passes. I kept watching for another hour or so, but witnessed nothing more. With the object being viewed against only the over- head night sky and thus no points of reference, and with it moving so swiftly, it is somewhat difficult to offer an estimate of how high above me it was. It was under a thousand feet, of that I'm pretty sure, but I would be more inclined to put it at just a few hundred feet. My mother's house is approximately two miles from Sydney airport and we grew up with numerous types of aircraft passing over our home many times each day. After years of this (sixteen), I had developed quite a feel for deter- mining how far away various aircraft were during the different phases of the landing and takeoff processes in progress continually around our home. What I have related so far represents my personal experience with UFOs. Other members of my family have had interesting encounters as well. Those of two younger brothers are especially interesting. Shane Prison, my youngest brother, was awakened by my mother between 3 and 3:30 a.m. one morning in the summer of 1982. Joan Prison had been watching something in the sky for awhile before she went to wake up Shane. This was a brightly lit object that moved and stopped repeatedly over much the same houses that the UFO in 1970 did, but wasn't circling. Instead, it was moving roughly southwest to east. She told Shane to come and take a look at something. He then observed a large white light paused above a neighbor's house. I will use his description of it. He says, \"Picture that you are standing directly under a street light. Well, as big as you see the bulb and casing of the light, that's the size of this light above the house.\" This statement was in response to my asking him to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2000 PageS Home of author's mother, where some of the sightings occurred. describe how big it would have appeared if he was holding it at arm's length. So even from where he stood it would have been covered by a light the size of a street light viewed from directly below. Shane says he watched it paused there for more than five minutes. Then, with no sound or warning, it streaked away. He could barely see it move and was conscious only of a streak of light viewed a tiny fraction of a second. It had simply just blistered away and there was no fur- ther trace of it. Shane says that it was not far away or very high up. It was only two or three utility pole lengths above the roof of the house and about four or five such lengths away from where he stood next to the house. Alfred Prison, Jr. had perhaps the most harrowing experience of all with a UFO in this same town that same summer. Alfred was walking home from his girlfriend's place around 11 p.m. and had just walked a short distance into the large field adjacent to her house. This field was a prelude to a wooded area through which he would also have to walk before get- ting to the main street that would take him home. Both the field and the wooded area were so dark you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, but there was a wide walking path winding through the entire area which he had walked numerous times, so he was not afraid of cutting through there so late. Very shortly after entering the field, he had a feel- ing to look up and did so to discover a glowing circu- lar object, rimmed with lights, in the sky above his head. It appeared to be about the size of a dinner plate (held at arm's length) outlined against the sky and glow- ing a dull white, almost grey. Alfred said he cannot say how high up it was, but it wasn't up very high at all, perhaps less than a few hundred feet. The scary thing about this encounter was that the object paced itself to my brother's walking speed all through the field (a very large one) and also through the wooded area (an even larger region). It stayed with my brother, directly above his head, for the entire walk (which my brother said was the longest walk of his life). It stayed directly above him at all times and moved only as fast as he was walking, maintaining this rela- tionship for the entire walk through the deserted empty field and the adjacent wooded area-both of which were immersed in pitch blackness. The walk through this section of Reserve Mines is about twenty minutes long, as I too have walked it many times. Alfred says he can't remember the color of the lights that rimmed the object because his attention was hooked on the unique glow of the \"plate.\" Another peculiar aspect of his experience is that he says he can remember coming to the edge of the wooded area, that is the path's end, but he has no memory of the object leaving. I personally wouldn't forget a single second of an experience like that, and would especially re- count its leaving, due to the deep sense of relief that would accompany the object's departure after such an unnerving walk alone. I guess my brother is of a dif- ferent nature than me, having an \"out of sight, out of mind\" attitude. Alfred soon married a girl he met later in life and moved to Glace Bay, a small town about a mile or two outside of Reserve Mines. Only about six or seven years ago, he was up late at night and noticed through his very large picture window an unusual light moving through the sky above the telephone poles in the park- ing lot in front of his apartment building. He looked closer, whereupon it streaked away from him at in- credible speed. He was absolutely sure he wasn't look- ing at a reflection in the window glass, as he was close enough to the glass to determine this was outside and moving above the poles. These six unusual episodes witnessed by some of my family and me are the basis of my fascination with the UFO phenomenon. I was not researching them at the point in our lives when they occurred, so nobody thought to make note of the exact date of each event. Other than this, the other details are very accurate as I have been over everything countless times with my family and checked into things very closely. I hope I won't be criticized for the few subjective impres- sions offered earlier, underscoring that such impres- sions are unscientific. There have been five other anomolous events that have happened within my family's experience which may or may not involve the UFO phenomenon, as no UFO was observed. How- ever, they were truly out of the ordinary and most dis- turbing. If not for there being multiple witnesses to them, I would dismiss them as either dreams or hallu- cinations."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 January 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Post Abduction Syndrome (PAS) includes cluster of symptoms Proposed by Rose Hargrove, R.N Field Investigator This paper was written to define the condition that many abductees experience following a lifetime of abductions-or especially traumatic abductions. This set of symptoms closely parallels the DSM-IV condi- tion known as post-traumatic stress disorder. It mani- fests in much the same manner, with some significant differences, as often abductions continue over a person's lifetime to an advanced age. As cited in the notes and bibliography, others have touched on this in other writings; however, I bring a more comprehensive and definitive treatment of this subject in my description of Post Abduction Syndrome (PAS) as an entity and a state of emotional and psy- chological condition. I do not write this to prove the existence of alien abduction, but merely to define the condition more fully in those individuals who present this symtomatology. Hopefully this will serve as a guide to researchers and therapists who encounter this condition to improve the lives of those affected. This proposal of a new and emerging syndrome will attempt to define the cluster of symptoms and behav- iors that develop in some individuals in response to the alien abduction phenomenon. PAS (Westrum, 1986) is an anxiety disorder that is closely related to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (APA, 1994). It is characterized by the reexperiencing of ab- duction related memories, fragments, or distortions of those memories, and is accompanied by symptoms of increased anxiety and by avoidance of stimuli related to abduction memories or abduction related events. The affected person may experience levels of anxiety that interfere with functioning in personal, occupational, or social areas. Diagnostic Features The requisite feature of Post Abduction Syndrome is the development of distinctive symptomatology in relation to the experience of the alien abduction phe- nomenon which is often ongoing, in contrast to Post- traumatic Stress Disorder or Acute Stress Disorder (APA, 1994) where the stressor is usually a discrete and time limited occurrence that is not repeated in the individual's lifetime. PAS in most instances is the re- sult of the sense or memory of being taken away by force or without consent by extraterrestrial or inter- dimensional entities,and the associated physically in- trusive or invasive procedure by these alleged entities. The abductee will have a perceived fear of actual or threatened death, serious injury (APA, 1994), and threat to their physical integrity. They may witness the ab- duction of another person, or may learn about or have close association with the abduction experiences of a family member or other closely associated person. The person's response to the events must involve intense fear, helplessness, or horror (APA, 1994). In a child or adult with underdeveloped personality structure, the response may manifest as disorganized or agitated be- haviors. Characteristic Symptoms Persistent reexperiencing of the traumatic event characterized by flashbacks. (APA, 1994) Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma. (APA, 1994) Denial of the event. Labeling the event something else: blackout, being lost, etc. Phobic avoidance of areas or situations where con- tact occurred. Refraining from sleep at the time contact occurred- sleeping in the daytime. Emotional reaction to literature, pictures, or videos about alien entities e.g. turning over books with a pic- ture of an alien or UFO, which may include avoiding them. (Bryant, 1991) Numbing of emotions and responsiveness charac- terized by inability to feel intimacy, pleasure, or to express emotions-emotional anesthesia. (APA, 1994, Bryant, 1991) Diminished interest or less participation in previ- ously enjoyed activities. (APA, 1994) May have a sense of foreshortened future-no ex- pectation of normal life events or normal life span. (APA, 1994) May fear abduction with no return or lengthy ab- duction. Anxiety symptoms that persist-hypervigilance, ex- aggerated startle response, irritability, and panic at- tacks. (APA, 1994) Note: PAS differs from Posttraumatic Stress Disor- der in that, as the abductions may have occurred since early childhood, it is difficult to determine precisely when the trauma began, whereas in PTSD there is a discrete and identifiable traumatic event. Anxiety symptoms include, but are not limited to: (APA, 1994) Sleep disturbances-difficulty falling or staying asleep. Hypervigilance. Exaggerated startle response. Sleepwalking. Vivid nightmares. Panic attacks. Alien phobia. Restlessness. Worry and rumination. Difficulty"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2000 Page? concentrating. Duration of the symptoms is longer than one month. Specifiers The specifiers may be used to specify the onset and duration (APA, 1994). Acute: This specifier should be used when the symp- toms are present for less than three months. Chronic: This specifier should be used when the symptoms last three months or longer. Delayed Onset: This specifier would indicate that at least six months have passed between the traumatic event and the dnset of remembered symptoms. Associated Features and Disorders In contrast to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, where survivor guilt may be present, there may be guilt at being different, or of contributing to the factors that cause the abductions to occur either to the subject or to family members. The following manifestations of PAS may be present: Reluctance to enter into relationships. Phobic avoidance of situations that remind the per- son of abduction such as: elevators, escalators, doctor's offices, physician's procedures (many women avoid gynecological exams or become extremely anxious when gynecological procedures are performed), dentist's chairs and procedures. (Jacobs, 1992) Persons with PAS may engage in avoidance of medi- cal care to the detriment of their health. Avoidance of pictures and or books about UFOs and aliens. Marital or relationship problems, such as guilt at the possible involvement of their partner, feelings of anger and resentment by partner regarding the sexual/ gynecological aspects of abduction, and/or feelings of guilt by partner related to inability to protect the abductee. (Jacobs, 1992) Parents may experience guilt and anger at the pos- sible involvement of their children or grandchildren. Occupational difficulties may cause loss of job due to constant obsession with remembered abductions activity and level of PAS symptomatology, (conversa- tion, Jacobs, 1999) Self destructive and impulsive behaviors. Social withdrawal. Personality changes. Panic disorders. Ago- raphobia. Obsessive-compulsive Disorder or repetitive behaviors or rituals. Depression. Somatization Disor- der. Substance Abuse/Dependence in an effort to self medicate to reduce anxiety or sleep, which may start at an early age. Constant searching for answers to ques- tions they may not be able to voice (conversation, Jacobs, 1999) Abductees may feel some part of their psyche is alienated from itself due to inaccessibility of memory of abduction experiences or partial or distorted memory of abduction. Some remedies attempted by abductees Joining fundamentalist religious groups (Bryant, 1991). New Age spiritual groups. Self-help programs. Altered states therapies. Repeatedly returning to areas where abductions occurred (Bryant, 1991). The person may develop an obsessive interest in aliens and UFOs. (Bryant, 1991) The person may seek help from the psy- chotherapeutic community only to be labeled as men- tally ill. (Jacobs, 1992). Evaluation of PAS Suggested laboratory tests (APA, 1994): Serum glucose, calcium, phosphate levels, thyroid studies and electrocardiogram. Urinary catecholamine levels may help exclude other disorders. Urine drug screen may be useful. Examination Findings Insomnia, trembling, muscle aches and soreness, muscle twitches, clammy hands, dry mouth, general- ized tachycardia and subjective sense of palpitations, dizziness, hyperventilation or difficulty breathing, uri- nary frequency, dysphagia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, possible hypertension, in females gynecological prob- lems, possible positive pregnancy tests with unexplain- able missing fetuses, unexplainable appearance of strange lesions, scars, bruises, or burns (especially geni- tal) (conversation, Jacobs, 1999), abdominal tender- ness, abdominal adhesions, malposition of ovaries, joint or back pain without memory of physical injury, sinus problems, and possible eye irritations. Specific Culture and Age Features Young children may vividly recall monsters who come into their bedroom at night. Children, adoles- cents, and adults may develop fear of going to bed at night and fear sleeping in their own bedroom, (con- versation, Jacobs, 1999). Children might express their abduction experiences in their art work or style of play. (Bryant, 1991). Children also might express the fear that they might be taken away from their parents by the aliens. There exists also the real possibility the children could be taken from their parents by social service agencies if parents openly divulge their own abduction experiences. Often children report that they have been told by the aliens that the aliens are their real parents. This has been frequently reported by children and adults reexperiencing childhood memories, and in fact may be a ploy to gain the child's cooperation, as children of a young age are more difficult for the aliens to con- trol, (conversation, Jacobs, 1999). Children might har-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS January 2000 MUFON UFO Journal bor the belief that they will not grow up to be adults. Children might also be exposed to witnessing the ab- duction of their vparent, generating feelings of shock, intense fear, and anger that their parents are unable to protect them. They may also harbor the belief that they in some way caused their parents or siblings to be ab- ducted. Children may grow up with a strong sense that they do not belong there, and that the earth is not their \"real\" home, or that one or both of their parents are not biologically related to them, (conversation, Jacobs, 1999). It would be difficult to assess cultural variables, as this phenomenon has not been studied in mainstream psychology, and in the Western World persons who report their abduction activity are usually regarded as having psychopathology (Jacobs, 1992). For indigenous peoples, abduction reports are regarded as a sign of contact with the spirit world or magical phenomena. Course PAS may occur at any age, and the length of the disorder may vary from three to six months to several years. The frequency of abductions and the variable of conscious memory of abductions may influence sever- ity and resolution. The disorder can develop-and often does-in the absence of other psychopathology. Treatment Reduction of anxiety and treatment of depression are primary considerations. In those individuals for whom denial is not essential for the maintenance of a functional lifestyle, restoration of memory may lead to normalization of their lifestyle. Hypnotic regression must be approached with great caution, utilizing ap- propriate screening and with an attempt to minimize confabulation (Jacobs, 1992). Currently, hypnotic re- gression with a competent hypnotist/therapist/re- searcher is the method of choice (conversation, Jacobs, 1999). A support system is an essential factor in the resolu- tion of PAS. Individuals with frequent and intense abduction ac- tivity may approach normalization; however, when activity is intense, symptoms of PAS may increase (Jacobs, 1992). An important factor is sleep. Sleep disorders are a common occurrence in the abductee population, caused by sleep phobia and very active abduction activity. Sleep deprivation, when prolonged, can result in de- creased serotonin levels, predisposing the person to clinical depression and compromise of the immune system (conversation, Jacobs, 1999). Prevalence Most abductees are unaware of their abductions, and those with partial awareness regard their experi- ences as spiritual or occult phenomena. In the popula- tion of abductees that are aware of or suspect that ab- ductions are occurring, some will regard their experi- ences as spiritual events, and others will view their experiences as traumatic-and a portion of those will develop clinical symptoms of PAS.

Canadian UFO research organization, CUFORN Bulletin cease to exist After 22 years of existence as an organization, and 19 years of publishing its journal, the CUFORN Bul- letin, the Canadian UFO research organization known as CUFORN, Inc. has ceased to exist, according to Lawrence (Larry) J, Fenwick, co-founder of CUFORN. \"The reasons for the demise of the organization are two-fold,\" says Fenwick, who has served as editor of the CUFORN Bulletin. \"First, due to the fact that the three directors now live in different cities and none have computers, two of them who have the keys to the group's post office box must make a trip to the box and meet me to get the mail to me. \"Secondly,\" he notes, \"the Internet provides so much news about ufology that many members, and many former members, who have computers get all the news they want from it. They cannot afford to join or rejoin when it already costs them the Internet fee. Since Canada is in a declining economic situation, with double the U.S. rate of unemployment, money is scarce for most people.

Briefly, the DNA testing completed thus far indicates that the Starchild skull, reportedly found in a cave or mineshaft in Mexico, is male and human. According to Pye, author of Everything You Know is Wrong, the tests mean that \"there is a certain detect- able amount of human DNA present. It does not guar- antee there is only human DNA present, nor does it indicate there is anything other than human DNA present.\" Carbon 14 dating, also recently completed, indicates that the Starchild skull is between 850 and 950 years old. The purpose of the tests was to provide information regarding the possibility that the Starchild was an alien- human hybrid. This possibility was being explored by Pye because of the unusual structure of the Starchild skull, as well as the alleged tradition in the area where the skulls were reportedly found that space beings mated with earth females, producing hybrid offspring that were raised in the local villages for a period of time before the space beings returned for the children. The DNA tests were conducted by Dr. David Sweet, director of the Bureau of Legal Dentistry (BOLD) at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Dr. Sweet is an odontologist (dental expert), and he was assisted by his research associate, Dr. Dean Hildebrand, a molecular biologist. \"BOLD is one of the world's best forensic laborato- ries for the analysis and study of DNA from calcified tissues, usually dealing with forensic cases less than 50 years old,\" says Pye. \"The academic credentials of both men are extensive and impressive, and their pro- fessional reputations are impeccable.\" Five genomic (nuclear) DNA tests were conducted: one on the adult skull found with the Starchild skull, one on the piece of detached maxilla alleged to be an integral part of the Starchild skull, one on a piece of bone from the Starchild skull known as an occipital condyle (a piece of the foramen magnum, or neck hold opening), one on the Starchild's right mastoid bone (behind the ear), and one rectangular \"window\" cut from the right-side parietal bone (the right side of the skull above the ear). Dr. Sweet reported that it was very difficult to ob- tain sufficient uncontaminated DNA for testing.

The Starchild Project's funding affiliation will remain with the Truth Seeker Foundation in San Di- ego. Pye, explaining why he is turning the project over to Deetken, says, \"I am now $50,000 in debt, due largely to lost book income and out-of-pocket expenses, which simply has to stop. In nine months of pleading for money [to finance testing], the total collected has been less than $20,000, the largest chunk by far, $5,000, coming from an old football buddy from college days who is not even active in our field.

The sighting occurred during the fourth week of Octo- ber 1999, but the witnesses came forward only re- cently, and prefer not to have their names released. The sighting took place at about 5:30 pm as three family members were driving down a rural two lane road near Pleasant Unity. Dusk was approaching, but the driver had not yet turned on his headlights. His wife, sitting in the front passenger seat, noticed the large figure first. About 40 feet ahead of them, cross- ing from the right side of the road, was a hair-covered, manlike creature, with arms extending below the knees. The wife stated that she had never seen anything move this quickly. The creature was stooped over, and its arms were swinging back and forth very quickly, she said. It crossed the road in three giant strides and entered a wooded area. The creature never looked to- ward the approaching vehicle, seemed intent on con^ tinuing its path, and was only observed from the side. No facial features could be determined. In. its stooped position, the witnesses estimated that the creature was about 6 feet tall, but would have been much taller if it had stood erect. The hair, which appeared to cover the entire body, was smooth and dark reddish brown in color. There appeared to be an area of longer bushy hair around the ankles and down toward the feet. The creature appeared to be as much as three feet wide across the shoulders. The most outstanding physical feature was the head, described as very large and seeming to slope back into a cone shape. It was about 18 inches from the jaw to the peak of the head. The witnesses indicated that a neck was not apparent. There was no odor nor sound detected during this observation. The husband stated, \"It seemed to be in a hurry. It looked human, but it wasn't. What struck me was how very fast it was and how it crossed the road and didn't hesitate to go into the woods on the other side. A hu- man would probably hesitate and go looking for foot- ing and watching their step, but this thing didn't.\" Gordon has been investigating anomalous phenom- ena in the Pennsylvania area since 1959. During that time, he has investigated numerous reports of encoun- ters with hairy man-like beings. According to Gordon, the earliest first-hand account of a Pennsylvania Bigfoot sighting that he knows of occurred in 1931 in Fayette County. From 1972 through the late 1980's, Gordon received reports of alleged Bigfoot sightings in the state almost every year. Since then, such sightings have been sporadic and much less frequent. The eyewitness de- scription given by the Pleasant Unity witnesses is simi- lar to a large number of other sightings of apparent hominoid-type creatures reported throughout the United States and many other parts of the world, al- though there are variations between the various Bigfoot or Sasquatch-like creatures. A 1973 case near Uniontown, PA, investigated by Gordon is one of the few in which a Bigfoot sighting is directly tied to a UFO event, although there have been indirect ties, such as an increase in Bigfoot sightings at a time when there is an increase in UFO reports in an area. (See December 1973 Skylook and February 1974 Skylook.) Most sightings of Bigfoot-like creatures have oc- curred at night. No creature has been captured, though they have allegedly been photographed, and castings have been made of what appear to be their footprints. At least three have been shot at. The typical Bigfoot has been described as eight to nine feet high tall, covered with hair (usually dark, but in at least one instance white), arms hanging below the knees, large orange-red eyes that faintly glow, a sound like a baby crying, a 50 to 57-inch stride, and an odor like rotten eggs or spoiled meat. Dogon, Sirius specialist Dieterlen dies French anthropologist Germaine Dieterlen, 96, died Nov. 13, 1999. A specialist in the Dogon of Mali, she was a director of studies at the School of the High Stud- ies in Sorbonne, founding member of the laboratory of CNRS \"Systems of thought in Black Africa,\" and presi- dent of the Committee of Ethnographic Film. After having lived more than 20 years among the Dogon, Dieterlen and Marcel Griaule revealed that these people had astonishing knowledge of the system of Sirius, in particular the existence of dwarf white Sirius B, invisible with the naked eye. This story was popularized by Robert K.G. Temple in 1976 with his book The Sirius Mystery. He claimed that the knowl- edge of the Dogon came from visits by inhabitants of the system Sirius at least 5000 years ago. Griaule and Dieterlen were severly criticized by their peers. According to the Belgian anthropologist W.E.A. van Beek, who spent 7 years among the Dogon, the source of this claim was only one advisor, perhaps informed by a Jesuit who had remained in the tribe before them. He said that no Dogon apart from the circle of friends of the advisor knew about Sirius B. -Thanks to Bruno Mancusi for this report."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2000 Page 11 Ufology Profile MUFON's Schuessler looks to the future By Dave Baker, Yorkshire UFO Society (First published in the YUFOS Project Red Book Vol. 3, #5, November 1999) Dave Baker: John, you became interested in ufology by a very unusual route...tell us a little about it. John Schuessler: I began a career in aero- space in 1962. Working for McDonnell Douglas, I did a brief stint on the Mercury spacecraft pro- gram before being as- signed to work on the Gemini spacecraft life support system. This work involved the speci- John Schuessler fication, design, test, and operation of the Gemini life support system. My initial UFO eye opener came with the first flight of Gemini - GT-2, an unmanned orbital structural test article. Right after launch, the engineering work area was buzzing with the discussion of two objects seen on radar that followed the spacecraft for one orbit and then flew away. Naturally, the Gemini structural en- gineers were at first concerned that the objects repre- sented a structural failure. Fortunately, that was not the case and the program continued as planned. On later flights with two astronauts on-board, I moni- tored the operation of the life support system. During a couple of flights, I heard discussions between the flight crews and ground control about seeing some- thing out the little windows on the Gemini. Coupling that bit of information with what I had heard on GT-2, I was impressed that something else could be up there and decided to look into the whole UFO mystery. Actually, I thought that since we had built and suc- cessfully flown spacecraft, it would be easy to use gen- eral engineering skills to resolve the unknown nature ofUFOs. That started my lifelong quest for answers. When I look back on the Gemini sightings now, I realize they were rather mundane. The crews did not see flying saucers. They only briefly saw an object fly past the little window in the door of the spacecraft. Neverthe- less, it became my inspiration. Baker: It has been revealed that Walt Andrus is re- tiring as head of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), and you will be taking over his role. Schuessler: That is true. Walt Andrus will com- plete a thirty-year terrn as International Director of MUFON and will retire from that position in the year 2000. It is not his intention to abandon his interest in the subject, but he will leave the heavy workload of the leadership position. At the annual meeting of the MUFON Board of Di- rectors in July 1999,1 was requested to accept the job of replacing Walt. Those are big shoes to fill. Walt has led the organization since soon after it was formed in 1969, always recognizing the grassroots nature of MUFON. At times UFO activity was very high and the membership grew rapidly. MUFON grew out of a nucleus of Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) members living in the Midwest. After the Condon Report release in 1968, activity dropped drastically because of the negative nature of the report. It wasn't a case of UFOs not being seen. Instead, the difficulty was in getting people to treat the UFO mystery with openness. After all, Condon had used strong words to recommend against any further investigation of UFOs. As you can see, MUFON be- gan in tough times. Nevertheless, UFO investigations survived and grew in intensity. MUFON is now rep- resented by volunteers all over the United States and in most other countries of the world. It is filling a need that has failed to be taken care of by governments, academia, or industry. Baker: What do you hope to achieve in the role? Schuessler: Going into the new position, I realize that some people will expect a lot of change, others will be concerned about losing Walt Andrus from the leadership position, and the majority of MUFON mem- bers will just want stability in the organization and a continued flow of good UFO information. Having worked in aerospace management for most of my ca- reer, I realize how difficult it is to satisfy the needs of large and diverse organizations such as MUFON. However, that experience leads me to believe that change, while upsetting to some people, is what keeps organizations vital and able to cope with the tough is- sues of the day. I look forward to the challenge. I guess that if I had to list my top priorities at this point in time, they would be as follows: ^To listen to the membership and do my best to guide MUFON in the directions the members want to go- ^To continue the strong positive values of MUFON, while bringing change in the areas that are seen as a problem by some of the members."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 January 2000 MUFON UFO Journal establish stronger ties with the general science and engineering community as a whole. ^To use the technology available today to make more UFO information available to the membership and also share it with the media. This is a difficult goal for a volunteer organization, but a very necessary one. +To stimulate cooperation between organizations. I would like to see a loose federation of most of the UFO organizations in the world. I look at it as the United Nations of ufology. The power of a federation of this nature has outstanding possibilities for every- one involved. Working alone is often satisfying for individuals, but the chances of success in exposing the nature of the UFO mystery is slim to none in this mode of op- eration. On the other hand, a strong front shared by all groups would be very difficult to ignore. And when the time comes that governments can no longer cover up the UFO activity going on in the skies around us, this federation could be the base of social stability in the world, rather than total chaos. Baker: MUFON has, in some quarters, attracted criticism about some of the articles and the general tone of the Journal. Do you think these are justified. Schuessler: I feel that criticism, if it is construc- tive, is healthy. No journal should remain the same year after year. As a result of the criticism, changes were made to the Journal, and I am sure more changes will be made in the future. However, some of the criticism appears to be a little obtuse. A couple of years ago the membership of MUFON was polled to get their opinions on MUFON and the Journal. Most people were happy with the changes that have been made. Some wanted more con- servative articles, while others wanted more liberal articles. To satisfy both camps, the Journal editor tries to provide a balance in what is published. The one thing the membership was clear about was they wanted no bickering and sniping between indi- viduals to be published in the Journal. And I whole- heartedly support that feeling. Bickering is destruc- tive and is usually done only for the purpose of boost- ing some individual's ego. What we need is coopera- tion and hard work. I propose to leave the bickering to the debunkers, since that is what they do best. Baker: You are perhaps best known to ufologists as the principal investigator of the infamous Cash- Landrum UFO case. Schuessler: I just happened to be at the right place at the right time when the Cash-Landrum UFO inci- dent happened. A personal friend, a medical doctor, told me about this lady that was being treated for very unusual burns in a hospital in Houston. Medical eth- ics didn't allow him to tell me her name or give me access to her, but we did discuss the injuries and treat- ment almost daily. Later, when that lady, Betty Cash, left the hospital she called the NASA Johnson Space Center request- ing information and help. Clearly, NASA had no in- terest in the case, but did refer her to me since I had registered with the NASA Public Affairs office to re- ceive UFO reports called in to NASA. The next day I visited Betty at her brother's home and found her to be a very ill and traumatized person. Her mother was caring for her and was very wor- ried about Betty's condition. Betty still showed the aftereffects of the radiation burns to her skin and the great loss of hair. I was impressed with the evidence and her openness. I told her that if she was completely honest with me and would make all her medical and family information available, I would stick with the case until we gained a resolution. Unfortunately, after 18 years, Betty died on the anniversary of her encoun- ter-without a satisfactory resolution. Baker: Have you ever reached any personal con- clusions as to what it was that Betty, Vickie and Colby encountered? Schuessler: As soon as the word got around that I was looking for information about the UFO in this case, I started getting inputs from the UFO community about what it was. Each person was adamant that he or she had the answer. Suggestions ranged from holographic images to midgetman missiles. Included in the listing was a number of alleged government-related projects that might account for the incident. I treated all inputs with respect and spent hundreds of hours tracking down the possibilities. Not one suggestion ever panned out. What I did find, however, was a fairly significant number of worldwide reports of diamond-shaped UFOs. The latest report of this nature was from Canada on March 5, 1999, as reported by UFO*BC, a Vancouver-based UFO organization. That leaves me with a database of information suggesting that a large diamond-shaped device is operating in our skies, and that device was not manufactured by any government on Earth. Baker: What do you think we can make of the deci- sion of the U.S. District Court to throw out the case? Evidence of some kind of cover-up? Schuessler: Betty and Vickie were very disap- pointed that they would never get a chance to present their case, along with the evidence, in a court of law. As long-time patriots and good citizens they had faith that they would be treated fairly. It was devastating to them when they were treated poorly. I was not sur- prised at the outcome. I did not expect the U.S. Dis- trict Court to allow this incident to end up in the offi- cial records of the court. I expected the underhanded treatment that was given to Betty and Vickie, and was"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2000 Page 13 surprised the case got as far as it did. The original claim for damages filed by Betty, Vickie and Colby was done at the suggestion of the U.S. Air Force law- yer at Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, TX. The trio had gone there at the suggestion of the Texas sena- tors with a promise of receiving help. They did not get help, but they were given the papers necessary to file a claim. When the claim was denied, I expected the legal route to be closed to us. Strangely, it was not. The denial of the claim came along with permission to sue the U.S. Government, and that is what we tried to do. The discovery process, a way for the lawyers on both sides to gain facts in the case, followed the filing of the lawsuit. This is the point where we found that we were not on a level playing field. Betty and Vickie made every bit of information they had accumulated available to the government lawyers in answer to the questions they received. The govern- ment lawyers were not quite as forthright with us. They refused to answer any of the questions that could have significant impact to their position, and even gave false answers to some of the questions. Nevertheless, the court looked only at the number of documents filed, not their content, so it appeared to be an open and shut case. No data was ever reviewed by the court. The case was killed by the judge's refusal to set a docket date to hear the case. Some called this a cover-up, while others labeled it \"dirty tricks.\" Baker: Do you ever hear from Vickie and Colby? What does Colby remember, if anything? Schuessler: I have stayed in touch with each of the victims on a regular basis since the investigation be- gan. I believe that all UFO investigators should do this. I deplore the technique of getting a story and running with it while never caring about the welfare of the victims. We all have a duty to put the victim's needs first and make getting the report a secondary priority. By the way, this event was so traumatic to Colby that he remembers it very well. You never for- get living through sheer terror. Baker: I know that you still speak with Betty's fam- ily. What do they think about the government's deci- sion to remain quiet and close the investigation? Schuessler: You are right. I am in regular contact with Betty's family. They are thoroughly disgusted with the treatment Betty received and have a very low opinion of the government officials involved. They watched Betty suffer year after year. They watched her struggle for justice and it never came. How else could they feel? Baker: This case certainly seems to add credence to the existence of the mysterious black helicopters much loved by conspiracy theorists. Did you ever track down the source of these craft? Schuessler: As noted in the book, we found three possible sources, but the government denied access to any records that would verify any of the sources. Since the 1980 event, many other examples of mystery heli- copter operations have been recorded. Baker: Is the case \"closed\" now, or do you still keep digging to find out more? Schuessler: As far as I am concerned, the case will never be closed until justice is served. And I am still finding more information to add to the database. In the past month or so I have testimony from a carload of people who watched a large number of helicopters return to Fort Hood in Texas that night. In addition, a directory assistance telephone operator, one of five on duty that night, has reported on the number of calls they received about the incident as it was going on. Some of the operators even went outside the telephone company building and watched as the UFO flew past their location, followed by helicopters. Baker: Thankfully, cases as shocking as the Cash- Landrum encounter are few and far between. Tell us a little about other cases you have investigated. Schuessler: While seeking information to support the Cash-Landrum investigation, I discovered more than 400 other UFO incidents that resulted in the wit- nesses noting physiological effects as a result of their encounters. I documented the results in a catalog of medical injury cases. Baker: I know that you worked for a time as Project Manager for Space Shuttle Flight Operations at McDonnell Douglas Corporation. What sort of work did this involve? Schuessler: My career was spent in the human space flight program. I began as a systems design engineer, and progressed to various management positions in- cluding Project Manager for Space Shuttle Flight Op- erations, Director of Engineering, and other positions. In each case I worked with the latest in space technol- ogy available. The Space Shuttle position was to pro- vide leadership to the contractor team that supple- mented NASA's workforce at the Johnson Space Cen- ter to train astronauts and prepare the documentation that guided their flight operations. Baker: As someone with working, inside knowl- edge of NASA, do you feel that they could possibly be involved in the sort of cover-ups which conspiracy theorists accuse them of? Did we, for example, really go to the Moon? Schuessler: One should always acknowledge there is something behind most conspiracy theories. The problem usually is to figure out what really had hap- pened or is going on. Of course NASA is capable of cover-up, as are most government' agencies. Did we go to the moon? I have no doubt we did. The evi- dence is overwhelming. I personally know the people"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 January 2000 MUFON UFO Journal that designed the machines, wrote the flight plans, and made the journeys. There are plenty of real conspira- cies out there, so it is not necessary to make up stories saying we never went to the moon. Such nonsense is akin to believing the earth is flat. If NASA is guilty of anything, it is a sin of omission-failing to do anything about the UFO mystery. Baker: Do you think it is possible that some UFOs could be secret military or even NASA craft? Schuessler: I am kept up to date on aerospace tech- nology, because I work as an aerospace consultant on a part-time basis, and my university Master's Degree is in Technology Forecasting. I imagine some UFOs are a part of classified military operations. In addi- tion, some UFOs are misidentified natural phenom- ena, aircraft, and even hoaxes. Essentially, all these things are identified flying objects (IFOs). The best way to evaluate this situation is to con- sider that we are not flying disc-shaped aircraft. The only ones ever built didn't exceed 200 mph. We do not fly cigar-shaped vehicles, other than rockets and missiles. We do not fly half-mile wide triangular craft that can hover and then shoot away at light-speed. We do not fly spherical aircraft, other than balloons that can move only with the wind, not against it. What I am saying is that humans have been watch- ing incredible flying objects in the skies around the world-flying objects that outperform the best human technology in whatever age they are seen. These ob- jects are the UFOs that serious researchers are investi- gating. They are presently unidentifiable. Baker: Okay, time for some sound-bytes. What is your opinion on \"Alien abductions?\" Schuessler: Alien abductions are an extremely cu- rious part of the mystery. Some UFO researchers are dedicating all their energies trying to uncover what is behind the abduction phenomena, why it is going on, how to intervene in abductions, how to measure ab- duction related effects, and how to recover artifacts such as implants. Unfortunately, we have too many abduction events and too few qualified abduction re- searchers, working with too little financial support. Baker: \"The Phoenix lights?\" Schuessler: The March 1997 Phoenix, AZ, events have evoked strong emotions among UFO research- ers. The field is divided, with some people believing the lights were nothing more than aircraft flares, while others consider this to be a ridiculous explanation. The argument tends to overshadow the reports of the huge triangular or wing shaped object that crossed the state of Arizona flying from north to south and going over Phoenix. I know a number of the excellent UFO in- vestigators that have taken positions on both sides of the argument. Unfortunately, many have become so polarized in their positions that they have little or no respect for the other's point of view. Baker: What do you think about the claim that Ken- neth Arnold saw pelicans? Schuessler: This situation is typical of what is go- ing on. In many of the classic UFO cases people arise to postulate a new theory, usually years after the wit- nesses have died. They make a lot of noise and get a lot of internet traffic going to discuss their concept. It is good for their egos, just as it is for those individuals that slam them for daring to think out of the box. A lot of people in the UFO field seem to need this form of mental masturbation in order to have an identity. My suggestion is to remember the phrase \"caveat emptor,\" or \"buyer beware.\" As far as saying Kenneth Arnold saw pelicans and not UFOs, one might as well claim he saw Santa Claus and his eight reindeer (9 all total). Baker: What do you think about CSICOP? Schuessler: It is an organization with a lot of pay- ing members, many of them with excellent scientific backgrounds. What I don't understand is how they could be satisfied with the lame excuses about UFO sightings that have been stated as fact by a handful of their mind-shapers for many years. They have con- tributed very little to the solution of the mystery, and in fact may be contributing to keeping it a mystery. Scientists, by nature, generally question everything they read or see, except in this case they follow like sheep. Baker: A recent explanation for Lonnie Zamora's classic 1964 CE3 at Socorro is that he encountered some sort of Top-Secret balloon test, which has not- surprisingly divided ufologists. Where do you stand on this? Schuessler: That is another off the wall explana- tion. It flies in the face of the evidence in the case. I trust the work done at the time of the sighting by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Ray Stanford, and others, and none of the evidence they found points to a balloon as the an- swer. Baker: Is the ETH a viable hypothesis? Schuessler: The ETH is as good of an explanation for some UFOs as any other. I fully understand the problems of distance, speed, mass, etc., as we know them. I am currently involved in advanced propulsion concepts that could mimic a lot of technology we see evidenced in UFO reports. Nevertheless, to say the ETH is wrong because we cannot yet duplicate the type of travel necessary to get here from there is short- sighted. The key thing to remember about the ETH is the last letter-the H stands for hypothesis. Until we resolve the UFO mystery, every claimed answer is just another hypothesis. Baker: What about the Majestic Twelve papers? They still keep coming, don't they?"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2000 Page 15 Schuessler: MJ-12 has become the title ascribed to a broad range of U.S. Government documentation re- lating to the UFO cover-up. I have no doubt that some of the material has been faked and fed to researchers as disinformation. Stanton Friedman did a good job of digging into the original MJ-12 material. Now we have Dr. Robert M. Wood and Ryan Wood digging into a host of new documents. I worked with Dr. Wood for a number of years and know him to be an outstand- ing and careful researcher. This research couldn't be in better hands. I have seen some of the new docu- mentation that is original paperwork, and it is outstand- ing material. It is time for other capable researchers to stop finding reasons why they \"believe\" this material is not real and start looking at the vast accumulation of documentation of data that indicates otherwise.

We agreed to do this by MUFON having a three-hour program on the first Thursday of each month. Since the Jeff Rense Show airs from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Pacific time, I tried to schedule the MUFON participants as conveniently as possible, allowing the eastern region folks the first hour of air time, progress- ing across the country with the west coast folks taking the last hour. It has been working well. The program began in September 1999, with Walter Andrus, John Schuessler and Dan Wright, each taking one hour of air time. The October program featured George Filer, Beverly Trout and Jerry Rolwes. The November program featured John Carpenter, Bruce Widaman and Michael Curta. The December program featured Scott Voight, Rob- ert Sylvester and John Schuessler. We will begin the new century on Thursday, Janu- ary 6,2000 with Tom Sheets, Dan Wright and Dr. Bob Wood. I believe this has been a very successful venture. Jeff Rense is very supportive of MUFON and gives us lots of plugs. The MUFON participants have done a good job of representing MUFON and have demon- strated the serious nature of the mystery that we are chartered to investigate. I hope you will all support this program in the fu- ture and urge your state directors to put their work on display by talking about it on behalf of MUFON.

I think you get the point. Darwinian evolution is far from fact chiseled in gran- ite. With all the reports of human-looking aliens, so called Nordics, etc., it would seem that the recent dis- covery of the large planet beyond Pluto is all the more reason to give Sitchin's work some consideration. Does Mr. Hall know how we got here? Is that why he feels justified in making vile remarks about others who speculate on this age old question? I have never seen anything of the magnitude of Sitchin's work with the name Richard Hall on it. I'm also sick of his overkill in the use of the term \"new age,\" but that's another story. —William J. Loika Kinetic energy formula I want to suggest a correction to one bit of misinfor- mation. Let me mention as background that-although I'm currently a visual artist and writer, and my de- grees are in psychology -1 completed two undergradu- ate years as a physics major. As a result I'm sensitive to errors in that field. Dr. Richard F. Haines' article, \"Spotting space de- bris and finding UFOs,\" made excellent points which I appreciated. Ufologist Jacques Vallee pointed out long ago-as Dr. Haines mentioned-that radars may be filtered to exclude what they're not looking for (be- sides which any UFOs detected tend to be dismissed as anomalies or discounted altogether). A number of his other points were also well taken. However, Dr. Haines' statement that \"KE (his acro- nym for kinetic energy) is simply velocity times mass\" is simply not right. (Actually that's momentum.) Ki- netic energy (to use his nonmathematical acronym) is defined by KE = 0.5 mv 2 (where m = mass and v = velocity. The form is like Einstein's famous E = me 2 , which relates this to conversion of matter to energy as a limiting case at the speed of light). An important point is that KE isn't proportional to velocity, but to its square. A nut or bolt orbiting at 17,000 mph has 10,000 (not just 100) times the KE of one going a more familiar 170 mph. A tiny object could explode a spacecraft at such velocities. The same prin- ciple is why a car crash is so much more devastating at higher than lower speeds. —Robert G. Brust, Verona, PA Lubbock lights response In response to Bob Young's letter (December 1999 Forum) stating, without justification, that with regard to the possible honeycomb structure shown by my Lubbock Lights enhancements \"it is likely what we are seeing at such great magnifications are simply ar- tifacts of the imaging systems,\" I would like to com- ment that the poster-size print of the image in ques- tion, on exhibit at the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, shows no suggestion what- ever of \"sided\" patterns outside the UFO image, no suggestion of magnification of a \"printer's dot\" pat- tern (wrong scale .altogether for that), or any of the other explanations Mr. Young has expressed. In any case, I have never claimed, nor does the Museum claim in its exhibition of the image, anything more than the suggestion of cellular structure on the underbellies of these objects. Absolute truth is hard to come by in this business; everyone knows that. However, it strikes me that one thing wrong with the field of UFO studies in general is that people seem to be afraid to speculate. Mr. Young says that specula- tion about the Lubbock image is \"simply a waste of time.\" Quite the contrary-reasonable speculation is central to the heart and spirit of scientific inquiry. Without it, nothing would ever be learned. Specula- tion produces hypotheses to be tested— are they con- sistent with known facts, do they have predictive value, do they need to be modified to account for observa- tions? Some people in UFOlogy act as if one must ei- ther arrive instantly at absolute truths or just back off and decline to say or think anything at all. That isn't the way the process of scientific discovery works. —Donald R.

On Nov. 21, 1999, at 14:45Z hours our satellites caught an amaz- ing photo of a UFO at an estimated hundred miles above the Earth off the coast of the state of Washington. Russel Kirchner phoned to in- form me that he had obtained the satellite photos and was sending them for all to see. The University of Colorado also keeps these pho- tos on file for reference. One of the satellites is designed to pick up water vapor or clouds from space. When Russel caught sight of the UFO in the display he zoomed in George Filer and could see the steam coming off a UFO. It was the type we identify as a large Mother Ship. We discussed the possibility of the object image being caused by a computer error. Similar photos taken on June 8, 1995, over South America have also been widely distributed. Philip Imbrogno studied this case, and NOAA explained the image was a \"moon shadow UFO.\" This excuse will not hold in the latest photos. This UFO was present for only a few minutes and is not seen in images taken prior or afterwards. The UFO has structure, windows, and radiates heat in the infra- red spectrum.

V-shaped UFO seen in West Virginia LEWISBURG-Nov. 14,1999, Michele W. and her children were driving on Interstate Highway 1-64, and, just before reaching Lewisburg, she spotted an unusual object in the sky. \"While traveling on 1-64 eastbound, I saw a quickly moving V-shaped craft fly soundlessly over the road and disappear over the mountain,\" Michele reported. \"I saw it approaching from the right side of the southbound lane. And by the time I yelled to the kids, 'Do you see what I see?' it had disappeared over the mountains. The lights were red and steady, not blinking,\" she added, \"It seemed like it was flying low, but it was completely soundless.

Vinsant writes, \"At about 4:25 a.m. on Dec. 5, 1999,1 woke up to see that a bright white light had lit up my entire back yard. I woke my wife and she also witnessed the light. The light then slowly climbed up my windows at a very slow pace, as if it were rising from the ground. We then watched the darkness of our house light up for approximately ten to fifteen seconds. \"Just as the light climbed up the window the dark- ness climbed up it also. Two minutes later, I heard an explosion that rocked most of Birmingham and was passed off as a meteor. I live south of Birmingham on a five-hundred acre farm. However, my concern is not the light or the sonic boom. My concern is the UFO that I witnessed with my wife and her parents. \"After I heard the sound I then walked outside and saw an oval/circular shape covered with lights that was hovering over the mountain. The lights would rotate around the dish and would flash bright like a light house when they shone in our direction. We watched for an hour and a half. The UFO flew around and hovered without making any sound. It would sometimes ap- pear to be one bright light and sometimes it appeared to be a complete circular saucer.\" Thanks to Mark Vinsant Wisconsin Air Guard chases UFO? BLANCHARDVILLE — Bill McNeff, MUFON Minnesota State Director, reports that on Sept. 13, 1999, a fighter aircraft thought to be from the 128th Fighter Wing (ANG) had crashed chasing a UFO at 2:15 a.m. This was in the paper one day and then it was not mentioned again: Wisconsin State Journal 09/ 07/99 afternoon edition. The ANG was making unannounced low level flybys and it (they) seemed to be chasing 6 little balls of light. This is not the first time either. Four previous nights they have been awakening folks in the middle of the night. However, the Control Tower at Truax Field de- nies any flight activity. Well today the proof is not in their hands-one of their F-16's did in-fact go down south of Mt. Horeb for no apparent reason. The Guard unit blames the crash on mechanical failure. Witnesses describe a shootout between the jets and the objects. One of the lights turned a different color and emitted a ray type of glow and took out the F-16 #WNG46-5607 piloted by Col. Ralph Emmit, the Wing Commander.

Texas light comes and goes HOUSTON-On Dec. 10,1999, at 8:00 - My daugh- ter was looking at the sky and asked me, \"What is that?\" and I replied it's the Moon. She said, \"The moon is to the right!\" I looked again and saw this bright light with what looked like lots of stars or fire, maybe, behind it. I was amazed. We watched it for about 20 seconds and went to get my wife and she came out, but it was gone. We stood there a couple more minutes and saw it again going the other direction. First, we saw it com- ing down. The second time it was shooting up. I can only explain it as a strange feeling. It looked more like a rocket landing or missile. We thought Russia sent one at us, but the second time we saw it going the other way. Well, we were amazed. Thanks to the World Wide UFO Reporting Center UFOs circle jumbo jet in Ohio SANDUSKI-The UFO Reporting Center reports that on Nov. 17,1999, their witness saw about 20 sil- ver spheres in formation circle a jumbo jet at 3 a.m. They were extremely fast and formed into a V shape at one point. They were headed north and the plane they were circling was headed north/northwest. At first, they flew in a group of about twelve cir- cling the airplane. Then they came in groups of four. They appeared to be silver spheres, and they were very quick. They had no lights or flashing and made no noise. They were seen at close range, and the jumbo jet seemed to be flying lower than usual.

Indiana flying triangle TERRE HAUTE-A university student and his friend had a sighting on Nov. 16,1999, when they saw a large glowing green meteor-like object traveling extremely slow horizontally across the sky at 7:30 p.m. Being intrigued by this sighting the two roommates went to the observatory on top of the Indiana State University Science Building. They were standing there with a bunch of other people at 7:55 p.m. when a lady said, \"Oh my God! What is that!?\" They looked up to see a large dark triangle shaped craft flying silently overhead. The sight- ing lasted for only 6 seconds. The lady said she saw faint lights on the side of it, and they agreed it wasn't like anything they had ever seen. Thanks to Ben Field and BUFOD. Five newly-discovered planets may support life SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Astronomers scan- ning distant stars have detected six more massive plan- ets, five of which orbit their suns at just the right dis- tance to support liquid water and-theoretically-life. The discoveries brought to 28 the total number of so-called \"extrasolar\" planets found over the past five years as astronomers survey hundreds of stars similar to Earth's sun for signs they may have planets in tow. Five out of the six are in what astronomers call the \"habitable zone\" which could allow the existence of liquid water, a prerequisite for life. This makes them different from most of the extrasolar planets found before this, which have been either too hot or too cold. \"That five out of six of these things are in the hab- itable zones of their stars shows it is not an accident,\" Astronomer Vogt said, noting that planetary tempera- tures could range from -38 degrees to 112 degrees Fahr- enheit. Hopes for life in these star systems would fo- cus on possible moons of the giant gas planets, he said. Until now confirmation of the existence of extrasolar planets have been inferred by the wobble of the parent star. Now astronomers have witnessed for the first time a distant planet passing in front of its star, providing direct and independent evidence that extrasolar plan- ets exist. Flying triangle in New Jersey SEWELL-MUFON's Evelyn Galson turned in her investigation of a triangle-shaped UFO observed by Chris Augustin, a web designer. On July 17, 1999, Chris looked up while throwing something in his trashcan. The lighting configuration on a low flying object was very strange. The triangle had three white lights, one in each corner, and a center red light. It flew from west to east towards the Atlantic Ocean very slowly. The craft was much lower than normal traffic at an estimated 500 feet altitude and was three times the size of the full Moon. It appeared solid with sharp edges and making a low humming noise.

Fighters respond to UFO on radar PERRIN FIELD — Chandler Yergin, Navarrone Technologies, writes: \"In 1953 I was a radar tech at Perrin Field, north of Dallas. I was performing rou- tine maintenance on a PPI scope (Plan Position Indi-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2000 Page 19 cator) when I spotted a huge blip in the New York area. I called an Officer, who was the Operator, and we watched as the Blip split into nine smaller ones, flying in formation. The bogies did not respond to IFF interrogation. Radio contact from the radar hut was made to Denver and Salt Lake bases, and they con- firmed the sighting. \"Perrin Field was a long-range early warning base; we could measure distance and azimuth, but not alti- tude. F-86 Fighters from Perrin Field and other fight- ers from Denver and Salt Lake were ordered to inter- cept and destroy. They were staggered at altitudes of 500 feet, to try and get a visual sighting. The forma- tion of UFO's was heading directly towards Dallas. \"We watched as the fighters were heading to inter- cept; the UFO's had crossed the border of Oklahoma and entered Texas by this point. When the fighters got to about 20 miles of interception, the UFO's stopped dead in the air, made a right angle turn, and took off towards the Northwest. We calculated their speed at about 8000 miles per hour. \"There were eight officer radar operators and three radar techs in our hut during this episode. Within ten minutes after the final sighting a group of about 8 men in civilian suits, and 14 uniformed armed guards came into the hut, separated us, and took us at gunpoint to a hangar on the other side of the field. \"We were each interrogated for about 4 hours, and during that time had to draw diagrams of what we saw, and write a written narrative of everything that took place during this \"encounter.\" After having the fear of God put into us about NEVER talking about this incident to anyone, we had to sign a document that threatened us with a $10,000 fine and 10 years impris- onment for violating the Official Secrets Act. \"These objects, whatever they were, violated the laws of physics, as we know it. I don't think there is any doubt that they were not of this Earth. Thank you for your efforts in trying to end the secrecy. God Bless.\" Video of UFO in Mexico MEXICO CITY-Dec. 8,1999, executive Jose Gerstl awoke at 7:20 a.m., and saw for the first time in his life an OVNI (UFO) in the sky on a clear morning and only a very short distance away. At first the object looked like a small balloon. But in a few seconds, it began moving forward and back- wards slowly. Jose ran for his video camera, thinking that this could be his chance to tape one of those strange objects. The object seemed to have gotten closer. It was a clear morning with a bright sun at 7:45 a.m., so he reports that he had a good view, \"and with my camera's zoom lens I made some close-ups of the OVNI. It had an oval shape and the sunlight reflected on the left side of the object. About 4 minutes passed when suddenly it emitted some kind of beam of bright light from the center, and then the light turned from yellowish to reddish in sequence, and then returned to white again.\" The sighting lasted almost 8 minutes.

Mariojouls, Skywatch China Direc- tor in Macau, reports that a strange UFO was seen all over the eastern area between Shanghai and Beijing on Dec. 10,1999. Clear pictures of it have been aired on a Hong Kong TV channel. Until now, the UFO had been described as a very strange ball leaving a trail of smoke behind and flying up (at least on the pictures). The Beijing Youth Daily published an article on other sightings, with a photo of two airborne oblong lumi- nous objects above the district of Changping, north of Beijing. In another article, with a similar photo taken above the capital, the newspaper carried witnesses ac- counts of UFO sightings on Nov. 14 and Dec. 11. Shanghai's press reported, with a photo, on two lo- cal UFO sightings on the same date. \"It was oblong, yellow, with a shiny pointed top and a white tail,\" said Mrs. Yang for the Liberation Daily. An aviation ex- pert who saw video footage of one of the sightings was quoted as saying the object was neither an airplane nor a meteorological phenomenon.\" Virginia flying triangle and sphere SPRINGFIELD-Chuck and Cathie Warren provided the following sighting report from a 23-year-old Vir- ginia college student and three other witnesses. On Nov. 17,1999, he pulled into his driveway at 7:15 p.m. and looked to see if the Leonid's meteors were visible, but instead saw a Flying Triangle. As he watched he could see it was circling a big area. At its farthest point away it was a just a red light, but when it circled over the house he could see it was an equilateral triangle making, a low humming sound. He shot some video of it where the light can be seen circling above looking like a triangle. It kept flying the same circular route for more than 4 hours until 10:45 p.m.! The size of it at closest rendezvous was about half a thumbnail at arms length.

Hall The final issue of the Century contains a large amount of good, solid, potentially important informa- tion, especially the newly uncovered Indiana missile base case. The authors (whose photo captions got reversed in an amusing gender switch worthy of Y2K) are to be com- mended for digging out the facts on this case. With a few more like it, we could raise the roof. That spring of 1966 already was noteworthy for the exten- sive midwest and northeast sighting wave, including the infamous \"swamp gas\" sightings in Michigan and the Exeter, NH, sighting publi- cized by John Fuller. Back in those \"good old days,\" on March 28, na- tionally-syndicated columnist Roscoe Drummond said: \"The time has come for either the President or Con- gress to name an objective and respected panel to in- vestigate, appraise and report on all present and future evidence about what is going on.\" That same day, Rep. Gerald Ford of Michigan issued a call for Congressional hearings on UFOs. And finally Project Blue Book was called on the carpet. The following spring UFOs were making their pres- ence felt at ICBM missile sites in North Dakota and Montana, terrorizing security guards. Many of the de- tails of these incidents leaked out only recently after the retirement of the missile officers. Then later, of course, we had the Strategic Air Command base sightings, Bentwaters, and others indicating an atomic weapons interest on the part of the nonexistent aliens. Some of this story is reported in the new edition of The UFO Evidence, which should be published in 2000. The Nova Scotia mystery of the UFO that hovered near the house is a fine piece of reporting, and a most intriguing case. One gets the impression in cases like this of \"show and tell\"; the suspicion that the presumed intelligence behind the technology didn't just \"happen to be there,\" but was \"revealing itself (in a manner of speaking) to Mrs. Prison, and possibly the others. It would be interesting to know what effect, if any, it had on her life or outlook. Clearly it had an impact on her son. The reports of diamond- or square-shaped UFOs are well done and thorough. Although the descriptions are faintly suggestive of a B-l bomber, the details would seem to make that explanation unlikely. How- ever, the \"estimated 1,000 feet elevation\" is not justi- fied by anything in the report; it could have been larger than assumed and further away, in which case the lack of sound would be meaningless. The actual distance of an unknown object cannot be determined without either knowing the size of the object or having some reference point, such as a land- mark that it flies in front of, or clouds that it passes beneath. One witness assumed it was about the size of a 4-engine jet without any apparent basis for doing so. Still, the reports have no obvious explanation and the MUFON personnel have done a commendable job. Kudos to Jeff Sainio for his empirical investigation and critical analysis of the \"photo events.\" Far more of this type of research is needed. Ample good evi- dence exists; there is no need to contaminate the data base with bad information. What is the saying about \"When pigs fly...?\" Well, maybe with a little assistance. And I guess when they fly on their own is when the news media will wake up and pay attention to UFOs. As Barry Downing says in his thoughtful article about UFOs and religion, \"I find the American news media treatment of UFOs more mysterious than the American government treatment of UFOs.\" Amen to that! Have the news media become overly trusting of government officials, overly homogenized, or simply overly lazy to continue turning a blind eye to what certainly is the biggest story of the Century and possi- bly of the Millennium? Dr. Downing has posed the hypotheses that are most important of all in regard to the ultimate meaning of the ET contact. Stay tuned. UFO Database on CD-ROM T.

Mercury is at its farthest E of the Sun (greatest east- ern elongation) on the 14th and is therefore visible low in the WNW at dusk until about the third week of the month. Use binoculars to locate the dim orange planet. Look for it near the thin lunar crescent on February 6. Next in line above Mercury is Mars (magnitude 1.3), in Pisces. The red planet stays low in the WSW during the early evening, setting shortly after 8 p.m. It can be found near the crescent Moon on the 8th. The twilight planet parade continues in the SSW with the two largest worlds, first Jupiter then Saturn above it. Jupiter (-2.2), moving from Pisces into Ar- ies, dominates the evening sky. The giant gradually is closing in on its big ringed neighbor, fainter Saturn (0.3), in Aries. Look for the Moon to pass both plan- ets, first Jupiter on February 10 and then Saturn on the 11th. Both planets set in the W about an hour apart in mid-month, about 10:30 and 11:30 p.m., respectively. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) rises in the SE as dawn begins, shortly after 5 a.m., and remains an imposing sight in the morn- ing sky. The Millennium Issue: Contrary to popular belief, both the 21 st century and the 3rd Millennium have not yet begun! While the year 2000 certainly is a milestone for many of us, it still represents only the last year of the 20th century, not the 1st year of the next century. A century consists of 100 calendar years. Since there was no year zero on our most commonly accepted worldwide calendar, the 1st century began in the year one and concluded at the end of the year 100. Simi- larly, the 20th century began in 1901 and ends in De- cember 2000. So in fact the 21st century begins Janu- ary 1, 2001. (That's why Kubrick called his movie 2001.) Now we all can party a second time at the end of this year! Moon Phases: New moon—February 5 First quarter—February 12 Full moon—February 19 Last quarter—February 26 O 3 The Stars: Sirius the Dog Star lies due S during the midevening. It is the brightest nighttime star in the entire sky be- cause it is both a hot A-type star and also one of our nearest stellar neighbors (8.6 light years distant). The Dog Star has a tiny telescopic companion called Sirius B or \"the Pup,\" a white dwarf star only twice the size of the Earth yet containing the mass of our Sun. A teaspoonful of the Pup's matter would weigh as much as a car if placed on our planet! A white dwarf is a collapsed star near the end of its life-the eventual fate of our own Sun. Orion has moved into its highest position in the S. Of all the constellations we see in our latitude, this is the only one with two bright zero or Ist-magnitude stars. Betelgeuse, an M-type red supergiant star, marks the right shoulder of the Hunter. Rigel, a B-type blue supergiant, marks the left knee.

Dwight Connelly, Editor and Walt Andrus, Edi- tor in Chief, are bringing you the finest UFO monthly organization magazine in the world. Personally invite your friends and relatives to subscribe to the MUFON UFO Journal, or give them a gift subscription. New MUFON Field Investigator's Exam Dan Wright, Deputy Director, Investigations, has composed a new 100-question Field Investigator's Exam designed around the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual (Fourth Edition). It was intro- duced Jan, 1,2000. Kathleen Marden will continue to accept the cur- rent examination indefinitely. However, we encour- age those who have not submitted their exam answer sheets to do so in the near future. Both Kathleen and I screened the new test and made appropriate revisions for clarification purposes. The format still consists of multiple choice, true-false, and \"fill in the blanks.\" Funds Needed for MUFON UFO Museum In 1994, when the Bigelow Foundation was provid- ing financial help to all three members of the UFO Research Coalition, MUFON obligated itself to ini- tiate specific new programs that we could not have fi- nanced otherwise. One of these was the MUFON UFO INFORMATION CENTER AND MUSEUM located in an office complex on the main north-south highway Bypass 123 through Seguin, TX. This is a separate fa- cility only a few blocks from MUFON's business of- fice at 103 Oldtowne Road. The fundamental purpose of the \"UFO Information Center\" was public education for the general public and media, as well as UFO enthusiasts. It is the only UFO museum in the United States east of Roswell, NM. MUFON members from coast to coast and bor- der to border have visited the museum, including visi- tors from eight different countries. We do not charge admission, but solicit donations only. Obviously, the donations do not cover the monthly rent of $350 for the 500-square-foot facility. After the museum was assembled in 1994, Bob Bigelow abruptly withdrew his financial support in July 1995, leaving MUFON with an additional expenditure that exceeds our annual budget. Over the years MUFON has received donations that are I.R.S. tax deductible for the donor in their annual income tax report. These gifts are very much appreci- ated; however, they are far from adequate to cover the annual rent of $4200 for the museum. This is the sec- ond time that we have solicited funds for this project, because the need still exists. Since income tax time is approaching, this is an opportune time to secure a tax deduction on your 1999 return. We thank those who were so thoughtful last year. Those of you who have visited our museum recog- nize its importance and the unique displays. We have had photographs in the MUFON UFO Journal for those of you who haven't had the privilege of seeing this one-of-a-kind display. The MUFON office acknowl- edges all donations or gifts of any size with a letter that you can attach to your income tax statement. If you want to see our UFO Information Center and Museum continue to share its displays, exhibits, and photographs with people interested in learning more about the UFO phenomenon, this is your opportunity to step forward and make a generous gift consistent with your financial status. May we thank you in ad- vance for your consideration? UFO Sighting Reports After the State and Provincial Directors evaluate the UFO sighting reports received in their respective states or provinces, the original with pertinent attachments should be mailed directly to Dan Wright, Deputy Di- rector, Investigations, at 3628 Aragon Drive, Lansing, MI 48906. A copy should be retained by the State/ Provincial Director for his/her file, and a copy sent to the Regional Director. This procedure has been more effective in getting reports into the MUFON database more promptly. Since our members are anxious to read about cur- rent UFO sighting reports that have been investigated by MUFON Field Investigators, please mail a narra- tive report in article format to Walter Andrus for pub- lication in the MUFON UFO Journal. This also ap- plies to older cases of a significant nature that were recently investigated."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 January 2000 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK New Officers Michigan State Director Richard M. McVannel (Boyne City) promoted two individuals to become State Section Directors. They are Rick A. Reed (Grayling) and William J. Konkolesky, B.S. (Royal Oak).

Desmet, Ph.D. (Gent, Belgium) was appointed a Consultant in Chemistry. Larry Gore (Fort Myers, FL) passed the Field Investigator's Exam and received a MUFON lapel pin for his accomplishment. UFO Sighting Reports MUFON-Arizona must be commended for submit- ting two narrative reports of their UFO investigations to the Journal, appearing in the December 1999 and February 2000 editions. Since our members are eager to read about current UFO sighting reports that have been investigated and documented, please mail a nar- rative report in article format to me for publication in the MUFON UFO Journal. This also applies to older cases of significant nature that were recently investi- gated. St. Louis UFO Symposium Bruce A.

Reduced prices for Symposium Proceedings If you have been trying to add a majority of the past years symposium proceedings to your library, here is the opportunity you have been waiting for. Due to the fact that we are moving the MUFON headquarters to the Denver, CO, area, we have elected to sell the most recent proceedings at a five dollar discount to reduce the cost of shipping the stock to Denver. Symposium proceedings from the years 1991 through 1994 will now sell for $15, and those from 1995 through 1999 will be $20. The shipping and han- dling charges will remain the same as on the MUFON Publication List: the first book in the U.S.A. is $1.75, and each additional book is one dollar. For foreign or- ders the first book is $2.75, and each additional book is $2.00. This special price will expire on Feb. 29,2000. Order now while it is fresh in your mind. MUFON Journal an Unprecedented Value MUFON is very concerned about the gradual decrease in the number of Journals mailed each month. We are fully cognizant that the web sites and e-mail communications are our most serious competition. People will say, \"We can get our UFO information for free\" via these sources. They seem to forget their monthly charges for these services. Each MUFON member/subscriber is paying $2.50 per month for their monthly magazine. How does this compare to your monthly fee for your e-mail and website services? In addition, there is much material in the Journal that is not found on the Internet. Subscriptions dropped 3% from July 1998 to De- cember 1998; 5% from January 1999 to June 1999; and 5% from July 1999 to December 1999. We took a (Continued on Page 23)"}]
