This model kit was drafted and designed by Testor's chief designer John Andrews from my four years of interviews and research, culminating in the evolution of my illustrated forensic composites of the spacecraft, its interior, and the flight crew. I used the exact same methods that police sketch artists use when compositing a murder suspect from multiple witnesses to a slaying. Additional meth- ods were employed similar to that which sketch artists do when reconstructing a new species of animal or fish from a frozen or washed up carcass. Introduction to witnesses Independently, both Capt. Kevin D. Randle, USAF (Ret.) and his former partner, Donald R. Schmitt, both of whom co-authored 1991's UFO Crash at Roswell and 1994's The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell, provided me with introductions to their wit- nesses and to their individual records and data bases so that I could begin the project with the Testor Cor- poration. Both consulted with me throughout the project. During this project, Randle and Schmitt sev- ered their partnership as researchers, Kent Jeffreys re- versed his position as a researcher on this case, one of our witnesses whose identity we had been protecting chose to go public on his own, and Col. Philip J. Corso came forward with his book, \"The Day After Roswell. I chose not to take sides or involve myself in any of the disagreements, but to simply carry on with my work. Originally I came to investigate the Roswell case because Bo Carson, a Hollywood producer, and Don Ecker, from UFO Magazine, were attempting to • make a docudrama of the crash. I was supposed to design the spacecraft and cadavers. When that project fell through, I published an article of sketches in UFO Magazine that captured Randle's attention. Later that year, in 1993, we met in Phoenix, AZ, at a UFO lec- ture, and he referred me to film producer Paul Davids. Mr. Davids subsequently hired me to design the spaceships and to sketch aliens for the SHOWTIME/VIACOM telefilm \"Roswell,\" which starred Martin Sheen, Kim Griest, and Kyle About the author William Louis McDonald is a private investigator and a forensic artist home-based in southern California. As a former Marine, he served as a radar and avionics tech- nician with the famous F/A-18 Black Knights squadron at their old home at MCAS, El Toro, CA. His current work includes sketch art for several law enforcement agencies on homicide cases. His UFO il- lustrations have been seen on eight different TV series, in- cluding \"Sightings\" and \"Strange Universe.\" He acted as concept designer on all the spacecraft in the Showtime/ Viacom film \"Roswell.\" Maclauclan. My spaceships made it into that docudrama and I became obsessed with reconstruct- ing the real spacecraft from descriptions of retired mili- tary officers and others that Randle and Schmitt had cultivated quietly since 1989. In 1994, while suffering from the final stages of lung cancer, longtime researcher Leonard H. Stringfield transferred his anatomical data on the alien flight crew to me over the telephone. The testimony of his three military physicians became my baseline on the five cadavers. If I could not apply simple basic detective stan- dards to my portion of investigating the Roswell case, then I wanted no part of it. I had done the movie space- ships based on the director's vision, combined with old rumored \"Bootheel\" disc forms. I wanted to re- construct the real spacecraft and bodies, working the case from the inside, out. Stan Friedman, Randle, Jeffreys, Schmitt, and Clifford Stone were conducting numerous ongoing in- vestigations. They were all working the case from the outside in, using historical documents, old military cor- respondence, archive materials from the State of New Mexico, and the \"feds,\" cross referencing the old pub- lic records to the testimonies of civilian and military witnesses and their children. A test is devised Not desiring to retread old ground, I devised a test that would allow for me to work with military and retired intelligence claimants: If they were all telling the truth, then they would all essentially describe a similar craft and flight crew. To work the case from the inside out and obtain a complete image of the space- craft and a complete description of the bodies, I would have to set up these guidelines: 1. The same methods and interview techniques would be used that are expected from forensic artists in homicide and other criminal cases to reconstruct ei- ther a perpetrator or a victim. 2. Counter Intelligence Corps MSgt. Louis (Bill) Rickett had told Randle that the spacecraft was"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 February 1998 MUFON UFO Journal \"Bootheel\" and \"Batwinged\" in shape. I would apply this image as my baseline for the spacecraft. 3. In the week of Dec. 13-18, 1994, immedi- ately prior to his death from lung cancer, Stringfield had relayed to me a complete and detailed description of the aliens from three military doctors who had par- ticipated in a preliminary autopsy of one of the alien cadavers. His incredibly detailed descriptions of the Roswell alien anatomy became my baseline to match to Frank Kaufman's (Counter Intelligence Corps) state- ments of his observations at the crash site. (They matched incredibly well.) 4. Any statements or claims that broke this pattern would be suspect. Thus greater effort would be committed to reconciling the veracity of that wit- ness. (For example, Witness Number Three's descrip- tion of a bell-dome shape was reconciled when the ship is viewed nose-on with the wings still under Kaufmann's tarp. It was still on the flatbed truck and the tarp had slipped as it was pulling inside Hanger 84 at Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF). 5.1 would maintain the attitude, as an investi- gator, that the UFO was a hoax or an experimental rocket plane or winged \"Von Braun\" missile design until proven otherwise. I would look for patterns sug- gesting old Axis (German/Japanese) secret technology. (The United States Army Air Corps A-9 version of the German V-2 Rocket was already ruled out.) 6. Proving the case a hoax or a military experi- mental device would be as satisfying as proving an alien reconnaissance spacecraft. My work on the movie was a privilege, and it brought me business with eight other TV series and specials. Only one goal However, my motivation and obsession was for only one goal: reconstructing the spacecraft and the flight crew, or the authentic and actual historic ob- jects and equipment that sparked the legend. Since I did not have any other motive or agenda, that is why I thought of the Testor Corporation as a possible spon- sor. A Testor model kit would get as much coverage in its distribution and advertising as another movie or TV special—maybe more. The truth would be exposed. Initially, a corporate officer at Testor turned down my proposal. Six months later, senior designer John Andrews and Vice-President of Marketing Ernie Petit pushed my proposal through, and Testor then com- mitted its full corporate resources to the project in July of 1995. We had a delay of a year-and-a-half. How- ever, by pushing the tooling to the limit, we were able to debut the finished composite on the fiftieth anniver- sary of the crash: July 4, 1997. After having secured the names and addresses of both our Wright-Patterson witness and pseudonym Steve MacKensie, who was Frank Kaufmann, Randle took me out to meet the Wright-Patterson intelligence officer, and Schmitt set up my first meeting with Kaufmann. Both men assessed my character and de- meanor and then provided me with detailed descrip- tions of the spacecraft, which they had both touched physically with their own hands. Standard investigative techniques The prescribed techniques for a noninvasive witness interview were used in accordance with stan- dard techniques taught in all accredited police and fed- eral investigative academies. I used the techniques that I had been taught on the job with Phalanx Investiga- tions of Marina Del Rey, C A, and with W. E. Holland and Associates/The Emerald Group for over 13 years. The Wright-Patterson witness chose to remain anonymous from the public. Randle checked his back- ground thoroughly. This witness, whom we shall call \"Witness Number One,\" had been a young graduating officer from Air Force flight school who, because of his lack of immediate family and his photographic memory, was tapped on the shoulder and whisked away to the underground nuclear storage pit on the Patterson side of Wright Field, where he was employed as a docu- ments officer. He had been personally selected by a \"histori- cally well-known general of great significance to U.S. military history.\" For three months he was allowed di- rect contact with the wreckage until they packed it up for shipment to Cheyenne Mountain, CO, Level 23. NORAD. He even crawled through the interior sev- eral times. \"Witness Number Two\" is Kaufmann, retired from the United States Army Counter Intelligence Corps from 1945 through 1947, when they were dis- banded by the new United States Department of De- fense. According to my research, Randle's research, and supportive tetimony from other WW II era retir- ees, the United States Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) were nine hand-selected intelligence officers, veterans of the Second World War, who were quietly mustered out of their regular army service contracts. Rehired as civilians They were rehired as consulting civilians and paid via the chains-of-command at army bases local to the atomic bomb assembly facilities and proving grounds at White Sands Trinity Site. Their actual de- ployment base was Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) with the 509th Atomic Bomb Wing. As civilians, the U.S. Government authorized each of them to use the uniform and ID of an army master sergeant and a specific officer's uniform and ID at the same time. The CIC worked in liaison with the commanding officers and their intelligence staff at"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1998 PageS FIG?UR£ 5. of- SKETCH '**<< «•"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 February 1998 MUFON UFO Journal each base in New Mexico, primarily at Alamagordo, White Sands, and Roswell Army Air Field. They were paid by the Army and reported directly to the Penta- gon and to Generals Martin F. Scanlon, Clements MacMullin, and Nathan Twining as needed. Kaufmann admits to being one of those CIC men, as well as Capt. Sheridan Cavitt and MSgt. Louis (Bill) Rickett, and to being one of the men who pro- tected the atomic bomb. Kaufmann once admitted to me that he also wore a colonel's uniform. Witness Number Three Witness Number Three appeared in 1995 via reliable personal contact and confirmed a number of Kaufmann's claims to include a nose-on description of the ship and the \"musical uniforms\" routine that the CIC used in the course of their daily business. Witness Number Three currently resides, in great pain, in Anaheim, CA, where he is being aggres- sively treated for skin and bone cancer. He has not seen any of his colleagues since the months following the Roswell crash retrieval incident in July of 1947. He flew as a pilot and wore a warrant officer's uni- form as he saw fit. He stated that \"Pappy\" Henderson knew him as \"Dutch,\" the way Kaufmann was known as \"Pancho.\" Like Kaufmann and several others, he claims to have souvenirs of the crash in his possession which will be made available upon his death to a certain fe- male Orange County (CA) UFO investigator that he fancies. Please note: Witness Number One is suffer- ing from a long-term battle with leukemia. Two additional witnesses stepped forward via friends of my former Marine Corps squadron mates. These two confirmed further aspects of my designs that I had recovered from the military and intelligence re- tirees. These witnesses are both retirees from the \"Skunk Works,\" where they worked on the F-19 and HAVE BLUE/F-117 Stealth fighter/attack aircraft. Access to the data They reported that Jack Northrop and Kelly Johnson, the founders of Northrop and Lockheed Martin's \"Skunk Works,\" had direct access to the data and configurational measurements of the Roswell spacecraft. This information had been applied to de- signing stealth wing form aerospace planes for the past thirty years. The data was supplied by the \"Work- ing Group\" at Wright-Patterson AFB from 1947 to 1952. They confirmed that the X-33 and X-38 aero- space shuttle planes, including the VentureStar and el- ements of the TR-3 Black Manta and the HAVE RE- GION program, were inspired and adapted from tech- nologies reverse-engineered by that very same \"Work- ing Group.\" They stated that \"Skunk Works\" CEO and design chief Ben Rich was also completely informed prior to his death from cancer in 1995. Within the Testor Corporation, a corporate of- ficer had formed a verbal relationship with Rich and had fed the information to Andrews, Tester's chief kit designer and MUFON member in San Diego, CA. Tester's successful spy plane series was the result. Rich gave them the declassified specs on the SR-71 Black- bird, the modernized U2 TR-1 variant, and the F-117 Nighthawk. Then he casually devised a verbal version,\"Scrabble,\" with his contacts at Testor in which the F-19, the SR-75 Blackbird replacement, the TR-7 Mini Aurora, and the Russian stealth MIG were de- signed and sold as model kits. These kits were so realistic that both the FBI and the NSA spent investigative dollars assigning spe- cial agents to conduct \"friendly\" interviews with Andrews and his co-workers and to nose around the San Diego Testor office, where they found no classi- fied materials. Two types of UFOs Before he died, Rich wrote in a personal cor- respondence that the,U.S. Government knew of two types of UFOs: the ones we built, here on earth, and the ones that they built, meaning the beings from out beyond our world. Off the record, in conversations, he told the Testor informant that several truths needed to be told: 1. That \"an item,\" as opposed to \"the item,\" was recovered from near the atomic bomb base in southeast New Mexico in 1947. ( \"The item\" refers to the original U2 spy plane prototypes being tested at Groom Lake in the early fifties.) 2. Rich's predecessor, Kelly Johnson, was given the security clearance and all of the data col- lected from the aerospace vehicle by the retrieval and analysis team at Wright-Patterson AFB. 3. Elements of the spacecraft's design found their way into many spy plane concept prototypes go- ing as far back as the YF-12A/SR-71 Blackbird \"biomorphic\" (Rich's term) designs. Witness observes copies Another witness contacted me in 1995. He stated his name was Hal Nord Jr. of West Palm Beach, FL, with relatives residing in my own neighborhood of Monarch Beach, CA. He had observed color Xerox laser copies of my spacecraft composite drawings that I was printing for the Testor Corporation at a public printing business. He mistook my drawings for a classified con- cept design from the \"Skunk Works,\" and he was con- cerned. In a subsequent interview, he identified him- self as the owner of a corporate aviation consulting firm out of Tucson, AZ. He stated that he had been closely acquainted with Kelly Johnson in the early to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1998 Page 7 late 1950s. While visiting with Kelly in his private office in 1954, he observed a detailed drafting of an aero- space wing form, slightly delta, with a canopy shaped structure at the extreme forward portion of the fuse- lage and shark-like fins canted inward at the rear or trailing wing edges. It had no engines intakes or cowl- ings whatsoever. He was told not to look at the drawing since it was something experimental for the next century. Nord swore that he never saw anything even close to that configuration on Kelly Johnson's drafting table until he saw my laser copies in the summer of 1995. He was emotionally bothered by the similarity, and his initial distress at our first meeting seemed genuine. Col. Corso appears Then Col. Philip J. Corso came along with his book. In several subsequent interviews, I found him describing elements of the ship's interior that I had only heard from the Wright-Patterson witness in any kind of detail. Corso confirmed Kaufmann's early field ob- servations as well. To conclude: the Wright-Patterson witness backs up Kaufmann's claims in nearly every detail. Corso's claims overlap the claims of the Wright- Patterson witness. The Testor Corporation's access to ''Skunk Works\" personnel seems to support all of our military and intelligence retirees' claims. Hal Nord Jr.'s story comes out of left field and matches statements made by my two \"Skunk Works\" retirees and our Testor informant's innumerable conversations with Rich. More confirmations Counter Intelligence Corps witness Number Three, who is dying, confirms Kaufmann. He confirms what Rich told the Testor informant. To him it's old news. The Wright-Patterson witness is in decline from his leukemia. Randle and Schmitt's interviews with CIC MSgt. Louis (Bill) Rickett confirms Kaufmann and witness Number Three. Rickett died soon thereafter. My father's membership in the JASON Com- mittee seems to have encouraged many of my addi- tional aerospace community informants to converse with me. A pattern is coalescing, and it is solidifying fast."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS February 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Katharina Wilson The role of animals in abduction cases By Katharina Wilson Copyright 1997-1998 The use of animals and images of animals have a larger role in the phenomenon of abductions than people might realize. This paper will look at the use of animals in abductions and the possible reasons for their presence. A review of the litera- ture shows that there are at least four categories into which ani- mals in abductions can be cat- egorized: (1) Abductees' love for animals; (2) Extraterrestri- als caring for and preserving animals; (3) The aliens' use of animal images for the purpose of camouflage and screen im- ages; and (4) The use of animals in alien experiments. Love for animals The index of my book The Alien Jigsaw shows thirty-seven references to animals. The \"Researcher's Supplement\" breaks this figure down to three catego- ries. The first category includes experiences during which I saw animals that I believed were aliens using the technique of camouflage. (I use the term \"camou- flage\" to represent the times that an alien beings change or distort their physical appearance during an abduc- tion.) This category totaled 13%. Real animals During my experiences, I also saw real animals. The second category contains the number of real Earth animals I saw during the time frame of The Alien Jig- saw. This category totaled 7%. Most interesting were the times I saw animals that were not from this planet, or at least not from the geological time-frame in which modern humans are existing. I saw these \"real animals not from Earth\" in 3% of my (total) abduction experi- ences. [1] If you have read my book you know that I have a deep love for all animals. You also know that I be- lieve they are sentient beings, just like we are sentient beings, and that they deserve the right to exist and evolve on this planet the same as humans. Many people reading this may say, \"So what?\" or \"Who cares—what does any of this have to do with abductions?\" You may be surprised to learn that it might have quite a lot to do with abductions. It may be the reason some aliens choose to interact with certain hu- Katharina Wilson has written about her abduction experiences in The Alien Jigsaw, The Alien Jigsaw Researcher's Supplement, and numerous articles. The Portland, OR, researcher can be reached on the internet at http://www.alienjigsaw.com. mans. In his book Abduction: Human Encounters With Aliens, Dr. John Mack writes about the deep love for and closeness to animals that some abductees have. One subject's name is Carlos. I have met Carlos and found him to be an extraordinarily gifted and sensi- tive individual. He is also a successful artist and edu- cator. Dr. Mack writes: \"Carlos believes that identifying with other spe- cies in his abduction experiences also helps create and develop ecological values...he has always had a strong connection with animals.\" [2] Carlos sums up this state- ment succinctly by stating, \"I think I'm really good with animals. I feel we communicate.\" [3] Dr. Mack has written about another man named Arthur. He describes Arthur as \"...a kind of contem- porary St. Francis,\" and says \"...he would communi- cate with animals, including porcupines, skunks, wood- chucks, rabbits, and birds.\" [4] \"Arthur and his former wife would train the rabbits on their farm to be affectionate by lying down on the ground '...with your chin on the floor;' at that height the rabbits would not be afraid of a human be- ing. Then they would be 'incredibly quiet,' and the rabbits would become curious, come closer, and 'let you scratch their heads.'\" [5] Like myself, Carlos, and many other abductees, Arthur has great respect for animals, which is evident when he states: \"Rabbits and other animals think in as profound a way as we think...You know it is beautiful in its own sense because it is so trusting, and there is a tremendous amount of love and trust and affection. It is just basic. There is a life energy there.\" [6] Arthur's description of the bonds he has cre- ated with his interaction with animals is too lengthy for this paper, but it demonstrates the ability on the part of the abductee to reach out to, and communicate with, beings who are different from themselves. Ability to connect a factor? Is it this ability to connect with beings other than ourselves that some of the aliens find interesting about us? Is this care and concern for the animals and the environment of our World something that draws certain aliens to specific human beings? These are important questions. Unfortunately, clear-cut answers are difficult to come by. For example, there are abductees who have lived their lives not car- ing about the environment and not connecting with nature and animals. However, \"after\" they became"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1998 Page 9 aware of their alien experiences, they changed their thinking and behavior and incorporated these other ways of thinking into their lives. The question that begs to be asked is, were these people changed by their interaction with certain aliens? A near-death experience Dr. Kenneth Ring mentions an interesting case in his book The Omega Project: Near-Death Experi- ences, UFO Encounters, and Mind at Large.. Dr. Ring includes a female subject who had a near-death expe- rience as well as a UFO sighting. (I found it interesting that the woman was not an abductee, but merely had a UFO sighting.) The woman describes how her experi- ences—an NDE and a UFO sighting—made her feel: \"These experiences made me cherish all life as never before. I really began to be aware of every- thing in my experience on a deeper level. I even be- gan to 'salute' animals I would meet, recognizing their individual worth, and, of course, my recognition of human individual worth began to grow.\" [7] Finally, we need to keep in mind that there are abductees who did not begin life as animal and nature lovers and have not changed their thinking or behav- ior along these lines, even though they have had many alien experiences. Please do not interpret this discussion to mean that I am suggesting there is a \"right\" and \"wrong\" way for abductees to think and behave. The purpose of this section of my discussion is to look at abductees' love for other animals and to try to determine if this behavior is attracting the attention of certain alien be- ings. In my personal case, I strongly believe it was my ability to feel love and nurturing feelings for ani- mals (and the possibility that some empathic abilities I had might carry over to an alien species) that drew the attention of some of the beings who have interacted with me. ET's care and preservation of animals The first abduction case I recall coming across that involved animals, beside my own, was the case of Betty Andreasson-Luca. I heard her speak at a confer- ence in Pascagoula, MS, during the late 1980s. Betty told the story of how, when she was a child, she used to set traps in the woods for wild ani- mals. One day—either while in the woods or during an abduction experience—the aliens related to Betty that her behavior was wrong. They were sad by what she was doing. They instructed Betty not to trap and hurt anymore animals. Fortunately for the animals, Betty complied. While Betty told her story that day to the conference attendees, I felt she was truly sorry for the pain she had caused these animals. I was deeply touched when I heard Betty speak and I felt a true connection with the message the aliens relayed to her as a young girl. In my heart, I felt the aliens who interacted with Betty did a wonderful thing by helping her to understand the pain she was caus- ing. Betty's case was investigated by Raymond Fowler and published in a series of books. The third book in this series is titled The Watchers: The Secret Design Behind UFO Abduction. During a hypnosis session about an abduction that occurred in 1973, \"Betty took advantage of [a] rare opportunity to com- municate with the aliens\" and asked them some ques- tions: \"Betty: 'Who are they?' I asked. I was trying to ask him. [sigh] He says that [sigh] they are the care- takers of nature and natural forms—The Watchers. They love mankind. They love the planet Earth [sigh], and they have been caring for it and Man since Man's beginning. They watch the spirit in all things...\" [8] A special environment While inside an alien craft, Betty enters an ar- tificially created environment called a \"vivarium—an enclosure for keeping or raising plants or animals in- doors.\" [9] She then comes upon a pond that, to her surprise, empties itself through an opening in the bot- tom of it. As the water rushes out, Betty can see many fish flipping around. When she sees the fish flipping and struggling, she becomes very concerned for them. Her anxiety is eased when she realizes the fish are fall- ing through the hole into some water \"way, way down,\" perhaps into a pond or a lake. Betty states, \"It's like the fish are being put into another place or something.\" When Betty asked what was going on and what the aliens were doing, she says, \"They said they are just replenishing, just replenishing.\" [10] Were the aliens replenishing a lake or pond on Earth with fish and fresh water? Or were they taking samples from our planet and placing them in a holding tank for transport to another World? In Secret Vows: Our Lives With Extraterres- trials, abductees Bert and Denise Twiggs share their perspective about the aliens' interest in Earth animals: \"We were shown to a room that I recognized immediately from my own memories. This room is a veterinary clinic. Animals that they have 'collected' from Earth are taken to this room before being brought into their society. If they locate an animal that has been injured to the point that it will not live and there are no humans in the area, they may take the animal with them and try to save it....If the animal lives, it is worked with and taught to communicate, and if it is a natural animal of the wild, it is put in the reserve, free to roam. [Aliens] and humans walk freely among these animals. The domestic animals are given to families.\" [11] One of my experiences I documented in The"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 February 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Alien Jigsaw has some similarities to the two previ- ously mentioned cases. There were several experiences in the past where I would find myself on board one of the aliens' very large crafts and I would be allowed to walk about freely to explore certain areas of the craft. One of the areas was an extremely large dimly lit area filled with glass rooms. It was like being inside a coli- seum, but instead of chairs and different levels for seat- ing, it was one level and filled with large glass rooms. Two gorilla-type beings While I was in this area I remember looking into two large glass enclosures. One had two gorilla- type beings inside with a large cat. The two hairy be- ings were sleeping. The cat appeared to be a domestic breed, but it was very large, weighing at least 50 pounds. I sensed that the cat was their pet, or that the three of them all got along with one another. Another animal was described as follows: \"The animal in this [glass enclosure] appears to be half lion and half reptile. It is lying on its back, and its mouth has fallen open because it is sleeping. I'm looking at its mouth and I can see rows and rows of teeth. I know what this animal is because I'm telling the people standing next to me. I sense the animal has been saved from extinction. Someone next to me whis- pers, That is something no one on Earth has ever seen before.' I'm nodding in agreement. I am amazed at what I am looking at. These animals are incredible.\" [12] It is interesting that during this time in my life I was rescuing and relocating many animals such as turtles, snakes, dogs, and cats that I would find either lost or abandoned on local highways. Speaking again from my own experiences, I have been touched in posi- tive ways by the aliens and this is one example. I think I had the ability to empathize with other species of animals besides humans prior to becoming consciously aware of the aliens' presence in my life. The aliens' interaction in my life perhaps strengthened this emotion and this drive within me. I feel certain it is the same with many other abductees. Not all, of course, but many. Unfortunately, in the last section of this dis- cussion, you will see that some of the aliens used my love of animals as a manipulation tool, the conse- quences of which have had a negative effect on me. The aliens' use of camouflage One of my favorite examples of the aliens us- ing camouflage occurred on Oct. 4, 1989. An excerpt from that experience follows: \"There are large cats inside and outside our house. There.is a lion in a cage next to our refrigerator and a bluish-gray bobcat. It stands upright and it is also 'in charge.' There was another cat, but now she appears to be a female humanoid with dark curly hair. She is outside with a Bengal tiger who is walking around the house trying to figure out how to get in- side.\" [13] It is obvious that a lot of camouflage was be- ing used by the aliens. In this case I believe it was to frighten me into behaving in a subservient manner. I do not believe they were trying to instill the \"fear of death\" in me as much as they were using these im- ages to gain my respect. After all, a human has to re- spect the size and potentially harmful results from being in the same room with a lion or a Bengal tiger. However, I hope that by now the aliens realize how deadly these wild cats are to humans and are not go- ing around scaring abductees half to death anymore! Ridiculous but believable The last portion of this experience shows the dramatic ease with which the aliens can make an abductee believe what they are seeing, no matter how ridiculous the image they are looking at really is: \" 'What is that?' I ask, as I stare into the eyes of the blue-gray bobcat. I'm very close to his face. Telepathically, I am told, 'A bobcat.' Oh...That is why I believe it is a bobcat, and that is why I believe every- thing else—because they told me.\" [14] It is important to understand that if an abductee has a lot of conscious memory like myself after re- peated exposure to alien camouflage, the abductee will be able to see through their tricks. They will eventu- ally lose the edge they have over the abductee, which I personally find very interesting. In other words, there is hope for abductees who are able to remain conscious and in mental control of their situation. If you are having these types of camou- flage experiences, try to focus on the logic of the situ- ation and what you are seeing, rather than on the emo- tions or fear the situation is creating. Other reasons the aliens use the technique of camouflage is to create a calming effect. To present an image of the abductee's sweet old grandmother or a small owl or innocent deer, is much less traumatic for some people than to see the face of a non-human be- ing. All of this is a form of manipulation, but some- what of a benign form of it. Unfortunately, the aliens also use camouflage for other purposes. A form of child abuse? Consider a child being examined by the aliens. Because the child is fighting or frightened, the aliens decide to use the image of the child's mother or father in order to get the child to \"obey.\" What if the child was being examined in a way inappropriate for the parent, but not for a doctor? The child may then carry with them throughout his or her life a negative feeling about one of the parents, or that the parent was present and did nothing to ease the pain."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1998 Page 11 Worse still, when considering some of the more sexually oriented abduction experiences, the child may actually believe the parent sexually or physi- cally abused them when they did not. This last ex- ample is a tragic result of alien camouflage. One thing I am certain of (when it comes to the aliens' use of camouflage, and especially the more encompassing screen memory) is this: It is the aliens' \"choice\" to deceive us, and I feel they know enough about humans by now to have a good idea what the psychological effects of this type of deception will be. To continue to use camouflage on their human sub- jects leads me to suspect one of two things: (1) what- ever they are doing here must be important enough for them to take these kinds of risks with our mental health, or (2) they do not care much about the effects their deception has on us. The use of animals in experiments While the aliens studied and learned from my love and empathic responses toward animals, some of the aliens also used animals as psychological tools to get what they wanted from me. The effects of these kinds of alien experiments—whether intentional or not—have been devastating on me. The resulting stress in my life is enormous, and it is something I have to face each and every day. There are many examples in my book of how the aliens used animals during my experiences. Some of the alien \"experiments\" I can vividly recall include: (1) Putting animals in danger so I would have to save them, sometimes at the expense of saving myself; (2) Making me choose between the lives of animals and members of my family; (3) Making me watch animals die and not allowing me to help them; (4) Cutting the eye out of a live animal—for reasons I still do not understand to this day; (5) They have even abducted my own animals (who I consider to be members of my family), or at least the aliens have made me \"believe\" they took them. An excerpt from a book by (the late) Dr. Karla Turner demonstrates how the abductors experiment on both the human subject and the animal subject si- multaneously. From Dr. Turner's book Into The Fringe: A True Story of Alien Abduction: A man named \"Fred\" is under regressive hypnosis with Barbara Bartholic, Karla Turner's close friend and mentor. Fred is talk- ing: \"I feel like they are doing something to me with the animal...they are doing something with me, my blood, my sperm, and my genes. They are injecting my fluids into this animal. I think it's stupid. I don't like it. Why are they doing this? \"I think I was lying down, and they were do- ing something to the animal...taking something from me and putting it into the animal. Then I remember seeing another type of animal running around. I can't remember what the animal looked like, but it was bi- zarre. Seems like the animal is part human, part ani- mal. Like a small child around two years old. The one animal that appears to be part human seems to be real hairy.\" [15] Animal levitated Fred continues by telling Barbara that the \"men\" are grays [greys]. The aliens levitated the ani- mal while she (the animal) \"was spread-eagle on her back.\" Fred also said the animal had hooves, like a cow. They took some fluid (what Fred believed was his semen) from him with a needle device. After this, they removed some fluid from the animal. Later during the regression, Fred says that some of his fluid was placed into the vaginal area of the animal, and the animal was then removed from the room. The other part of the fluid they took from Fred was taken to a computer. [16] It appears that during this unusual medical pro- cedure, bodily fluids from a human being were placed into an animal. With our ability to clone animals, we have to consider the possibility that these aliens are at least as advanced as we are. Could this have been some sort of genetic manipulation? When Barbara asked Fred for his opinion about what he remembered, he said, \"They are regenerating from animal to human, from human to animal....Regenerating DNA.\" [17] An underground base For those who do not like to depend solely on information retrieved with the use of hypnosis, I can offer one of my conscious memories relating to this subject. (I have not undergone regressive hypnosis since 1988.) In July of 1993, I found myself standing out- side at night near the entrance to an underground base that was situated inside a mountain. I saw official-look- ing people and some military personnel. A \"Blonde\" being with dark brown eyes said to me: \"Your Government is performing human clon- ing experiments. Men and women are being cloned and experimented on. When the experiments are over the clones are used for prostitution by the scientists, the government people, and the military personnel. After they are 'through' with them or no longer want them, the clones are killed.\" [18] After learning this, I was very sad for I had recently had another encounter dur- ing which I saw two clones of myself. The Blonde con- tinued: \"Our technology was taken from us. Your Gov- ernment manipulated us into believing they would use our technology to help your species, but instead, they used it for their own purposes. It is out of control. It is"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 February 1998 MUFON UFO Journal beyond our ability to stop your Government without your help.\" \"I felt a sickness in the pit of ray stomach and I wondered what on Earth I, or any other abductee, could do to stop these abuses. After all, cloning is sup- posed to be impossible, and besides, no one believes in aliens. I felt completely helpless.\" [19] Today, we now know that cloning mammals is possible and I believe all of this, including these types of experiences, are going to be validated one day. I want to make it clear that by making this statement, I do not fault all of the members of our Government or our military. I believe most of these people are out of the information loop, so to speak. They have no knowl- edge because they do not have a \"need to know.\" I also doubt very seriously that the United States Gov- ernment is the only government involved in this. SUMMARY I hope the previous examples from my case, as well as other published cases, demonstrates that there are indeed at least four categories into which animals in abductions can be categorized Abductees' love for animals and extraterres- trials caring for and preserving animals shows us the positive side of their interaction with animals. The aliens' use of animal images for the purpose of camou- flage and screen memories, and the use of animals in alien experiments, shows us a much darker side of the aliens' actions. We can try to look at the positive side and hope that there really are different types of aliens, each with different agendas. We can also be more pragmatic and realize the aliens are most likely much more techno- logically advanced than humans. We know they are manipulating our perceptions of them, but that does not mean we have to give up the fight for the truth. I urge those of you who are experiencing this phenomenon to keep writing in your journals; draw pictures when you can; go to your doctors for physical check-ups if something occurs that affects your health; and share your information with truthful researchers. Please continue to document everything you can about what is occurring to you and try to get your informa- tion out to others. I have no doubt that we will eventually find the truth. The truth is ours, it belongs to us. NOTES: [1] Katharina Wilson, The Alien Jigsaw Researcher's Supplement (Portland, Oregon: Puzzle Publishing, 1993)30-31. [2] John E.

Mutilated steer provides more questions than answers (From the 1114197 Herald & News, Klamath Falls, OR; courtesy of Lou Parish's UFO Newsclipping Service) Tests run on grass samples next to a mutilated steer indicate eight normal samples and one which showed \"evidence of complete reversal of the respira- tion process,\" according to Nancy Talbott, director of the Michigan lab which tested the samples. \"The grass in this sample thought it was spring and has initiated its annual growth cycle,\" she added. The steer, lying on its right side, had its left ear removed and its rectum had been cored out in an oval cut. There was reportedly no sign of a struggle, and no blood on the ground or on the steer. Clark and Nancy Gardner, who found the steer, are longtime ranchers. They checked for tire and ani- mal tracks on the muddy ground, but found none. \"We know there are coyotes and other preda- tors around.\" says Mrs. Gardner, \"and we were sur- prised they had not touched the carcass. The lack of a struggle and the smooth cuts sure indicated that some- thing other than a bullet or coyote did this.\" Similar cases have been reported in the area."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1998 Page 13 John Schuessler Physiological effects from abductions By John Schuessler Editor's Note: This is the final segment of John Schuessler's series on physiological effects from UFOs. Schuessler is MUFON Deputy Direc- tor for Administration, and chair of MUFON's Medical Committee. Physiological effects related to the abduction ex- perience appear to fall into one of two categories. In the first category the witness has a close encounter with a UFO and is then abducted. In the second, the witness is abducted without first hav- ing seen the UFO. Close Encounters Followed by an Abduction Event On Oct. 16, 1957, a farmer was plowing at night in his field near Sao Francisco de Sales. Brazil, when he spotted a red light in the sky. As it neared, he could see that it was an egg-shaped object. The object landed nearby, and five beings forced him into the craft where they took his clothes. They washed his body with a strange fluid, took a blood sample from his chin, and left him alone and shivering. He became ill and vomited. Then he was forced to have sex with a female being. Following the event, he suffered a loss of appetite, burning eyes, and loss of sleep. After three days his ability to eat and sleep returned, but his eye problems persisted over a long period of time. The famous Hill encounter On Sept. 20,1961, Betty and Barney Hill spot- ted a bright light as they drove through the White Moun- tains of New Hampshire. As the light came closer to their car, they could see it was a large vehicle. They heard a beeping sound and were taken into the vehicle by several beings where they were given extensive medical-type examinations. Some of the procedures were painful. Following the event they discovered a signifi- cant loss of time, had terrible nightmares, and continu- ally suffered from sleep disturbance. Huge warts grew on Barney's genital area. Nurse examined On May 3, 1968, a nurse's aide in Westmoreland, NY, saw a UFO and remembered noth- ing else until she awoke in bed. During the aftermath of the event she suffered from nightmares and mi- graines, stopped menstruating, and had red rings on her abdomen. Later she found she had been taken aboard the object, placed on an examination table, and worked on by small beings. She claimed that during one of the processes a long needle was used to remove ova samples from her body. Woman abducted On Oct. 20,1973, a woman was abducted from a spot near her car and taken aboard a craft where be- ings conducted medical tests on her, including blood tests, skin scrapings and a rectal exam. They pressed needles into her arms and abdomen. Following the event she suffered from depression, weight loss and sleep loss. Blood taken in Sweden On March 23, 1974, a man was pulled from his car near Lindholmen, Sweden, by a light beam from a UFO hovering overhead. Inside he met four beings that caused pain in his cheek by taking blood. He suf- fered a loss of time. After the event his wife cleaned the blood from his face and found a hole in the skin just below his temple. Argentina abduction On Jan. 5,1975, a man was walking home from work in White, Argentina, when a beam of light from the sky struck him. He was immediately paralyzed. Then a rush of air seemed to move him upward and he became unconscious. He awoke inside a spherical-shaped object where three beings came in and started touching him. He lost consciousness again and awoke in a strange field 200 miles from his home. He was taken to Buenos Aires, where he spent three days in a hospi- tal. He was unable to eat for more than 24 hours and couldn't sleep for two days. Airman taken aboard On Aug. 13, 1975 a USAF sergeant was in the desert near Alamogordo, NM, watching for meteors when a glowing gray disk-shaped object came down near his car. The object made a high pitched sound as it engulfed the car in a glow of light. During this time he was unable to start the car to escape. As beings pulled him inside the craft he lost consciousness. When he came to, he was inside the craft, but still paralyzed. He could smell a sickeningly sweet odor in the air. Following the event he found a puncture wound at the base of his spine. He broke out in little red blotches from his chest to his knees, lost some hair,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 February 1998 MUFON UFO Journal had frequent headaches, and became very short tem- pered. Two suffer injuries in Maine On Oct. 27, 1975, two people encountered an object near their car in Oxford, ME. As the car was bathed in light they both lost consciousness. Later they found they had been abducted. Following the event they suffered from swol- len feet and ankles, eye discoloration, visual distor- tion, redness of the face and neck, sore teeth, head- aches, and had difficulty swallowing. Three women examined On Jan. 6, 1976, three women watched a large metallic gray disk-shaped object follow their car near Liberty, KY. The driver lost control of the car as they were abducted. During the abduction event they were placed on examination tables and subjected to painful examinations. The inside of the object was a \"dark, hot place,\" where small beings worked on them. Following the event all three had red burn marks on their necks, their eyes were irritated, and one suffered from bad chest pains. Whenever water touched their skin, the skin burned profusely. English girl taken On Jan. 23, 1976, a 17-year-old girl in north- ern England was abducted at a bus stop near her home when an object the size of a house landed beside her. She felt a pressure in her head and shoulders, an \"off' taste in her mouth, and her teeth seemed to vibrate. She suffered from a period of lost time. Following the event a purple rash covered her neck, chest, shoulders, and upper back. Her eyes hurt and her joints ached. The upper fillings fell out of her teeth, and the lower fillings crumbled into dust. Family examined In December, 1976, a man, woman and their four-month-old son were abducted from their car near Goodland, KS, and were taken aboard a large disk-shaped craft. Beings with large eyes gave them a medical exam. Following the event the couple found puncture marks and discoloration on various parts of their bodies. Two abducted in Brazil On Oct. 15, 1979, two people (one is a well-known concert pianist) encountered a huge craft near Ponta Negra, Brazil, and their car stopped. Small beings took them into the craft and gave them medical exams. They experienced a two-hour time loss. Following the event they suffered with burn- ing eyes, a burning sensation inside the body, and had trouble urinating. Abduction Events without a UFO sighting In June, 1950, a girl was playing on her grandfather's farm when she found she had a half-inch long cut on her leg, but no pain. The cut was bleeding. There was no cut or tear in her jeans. Under hypnosis she remembered being on an operating table in a large domed room with a strange being beside her. She was told they wanted to take a little piece of her home with them—hence the cut. Missing two days On Dec. 8, 1954, a 57-year-old peasant was abducted by two beings. He felt like he was flying and weightless. He was missing for two days and was found dry when he returned, although it had been raining the whole time he was gone. Following the event, he lived in a wild, confused state and in great fear. Nebraska girl taken On Oct. 7,1955, a girl was abducted by a small being from her bedroom in Nebraska. She was placed on a table of silver metal where the beings took hair and blood samples. It was a painful event. Pregnant woman abducted On Jan. 17, 1970, a pregnant woman was ab- ducted from her home in Westbury, Long Island, NY. She was returned with a mark on her abdomen like that from an amniocentesis test, marked with a spot of blood on her gown. The spot on her abdomen was very cold to the touch. She recalled the smell of ozone. Georgia medical exam On Dec. 15,1971, a woman was abducted from her home in Forsyth County, GA, and given a medical exam. She heard the rushing sound of air and felt the coolness of the floor. Following the event, she had blis- ters on the skin, backaches, burns, insomnia, night- mares, and her eyes were sensitive to light. Idaho abduction On June 20,1977, a woman awoke in her bed- room in Coeur D' Alene, ID, feeling paralyzed and un- able to speak or move. She saw a being in the room. Suddenly, she was able to move and rushed into the front room to find two hours had lapsed. She had a severe headache for the next two days. Under hypnosis she found she had been ab- ducted, had a warm light placed on her back, was given an examination, and had observed a wheel-like device with medical instruments on it. South Carolina man taken On March 18,1978, a man was abducted from his back yard in Summerville, SC, and deposited back"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1998 Page 15 on the ground 15 miles from his home. He was first struck by a blue beam and paralyzed. He lost nearly three hours time during the event, during which time he was given a medical examination. Following the event, he had migraine headaches and sleeplessness. Brazil man bruised On June 28, 1979, a man was abducted as he left work in Mirassol, Brazil and was taken into a large craft. Beings communicated with him via telepathy as they disrobed him, injected him with a hypodermic device, smeared him with a bad smelling oil, and forced him to have sex with a female being. He was returned minus his shorts. He had bruises on his body that lasted for months. His dog was affected by the event also. Conclusion UFO researchers and investigators have been accumulating information about UFO events for more than 50 years. Much of the data has been used to prove that UFOs exist or do not exist. During the years, a sub-set of information about physiological effects on humans has slowly developed. Unfortunately, the physiological effect cases have been poorly investigated and poorly studied. The victims have usually suffered alone. When they have spoken out, they have been subjected to doubt and ridicule, a situation not conducive to getting further cooperation from serious investigators. Lacking a well-defined protocol for investigat- ing these cases, UFO investigators have usually col- lected nothing more than anecdotal data from the events. Follow-up examinations each year for several years after the events has been virtually non-existent. The Mutual UFO Network has tried to improve the situation by organizing a Medical Committee con- sisting of health care professionals as consultants to MUFON. In addition, MUFON published a section in the MUFON Field Investigators Manual on investigat- ing medical injuries. Still, the historical perspective on this problem is poorly understood. A thorough study of the physi- ological effects resulting from UFO close encounters and abduction events is potentially the most effective way possible to help the victims of these events. At the same time it might contribute to the full resolution of the UFO mystery. Next month in the Journal The promise of nano-technology Mexico City UFO video Roswell debris testimony (conclusion) What American documents hide/reveal, Part 2 Book review Regular columns Other features as space permits Robert J. Durant Part 2: The I beam The Roswell debris testimony of Dr. Jesse Marcel, Jr. By Robert J. Durant Editor's Note: This is the second installment of an article which responds to \"Anatomy of a Myth,\" by Kent Jeffrey, which ap- peared in the July, 1997, is- sue of the MUFON UFO Journal. Dr. Jesse Marcel, Jr. is the son of the late Maj. Jesse Marcel. Maj. Marcel returned from the alleged site of a 1947 UFO crash near Roswell, N.M., with a box of debris which he excitedly showed to his wife and son. The Air Force claimed he had found a weather balloon and radar target. The \"I Beam\" In the box of debris was a single rod which [the then young] Dr. Marcel examined with great care. In order to view the rod under the best circumstances, he moved in the kitchen to a place where the ceiling light played over his shoulder directly on the rod. The rod was about 12 to 18 inches long, about three-eighths of an inch on edge, with smooth, undam- aged ends, and had a well defined cross-section shaped like an \"I beam.\" The rod was very light and did not flex, al- though he can't recall trying to bend it. The sense I got from the testimony is that the rod was not obviously supple, but that its strength was not tested. Dr. Marcel insists that the rod seemed to be composed of metal, not wood. Strange \"hieroglyphics\" On the inner surface of one side, running along the entire length of the rod, he saw a series of mark- ings or figures that for want of a better description he called \"hieroglyphics.\" These markings were of uni- form density and color. He was puzzled about how they were fixed to the rod, and concluded that they appeared to be printed or embossed. The string of \"hieroglyphics\" was contained on the flat surface within the lips of the \"I.\" There were no other markings on the rod. (Some time ago Dr. Marcel, Mr. Jeffrey, and engineer Miller Johnson co- operated on the production of plastic models of this"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 February 1998 MUFON UFO Journal \"rod,\" which were then advertised for sale. The de- scription of this \"rod\" under hypnosis is consistent in every detail with the plastic model.) According to C. B. Moore, who was chief en- gineer of Project Mogul, the framework for the radar reflectors consisted of balsa wood sticks coated with \"Elmer's Glue\" for waterproofing and strengthening. The edges of the paper-foil were glued to the balsa members, and cellophane (acetate film) adhesive \"Scotch\" tape was used to strengthen the bond between the paper-foil and the framework on some of the tar- gets. About 48 linear feet of balsa sticks were used in the construction, which consisted of seven right angle triangles, each having sides two feet long with a hy- potenuse member two feet and ten inches long. The entire assembly weighed only 3 l/2ounces! Metal, not balsa wood Mr. Jeffrey believes that Dr. Marcel thought he was handling metal instead of balsa wood because of the glue that covered the surface of the sticks. I have tested the effect of three coats of Elmer's Glue on a balsa stick, letting each coat dry before applying the next. The result was a stick undeniably of balsa wood, but with a somewhat smooth surface. (Nor did the cross section change in shape from square to \"I beam.\") Moore remembers that some of the radar re- flectors in the Project Mogul arrays used cellophane tape about three-quarters of an inch wide. A fact that has caused great confusion is the recollection of Moore and his colleagues that the cellophane tape had a re- peating pattern of flowers embossed on its surface. The flowered pattern had no special meaning or function. Apparently the manufacturer of the tar- gets, a small company in Manhattan that has long since gone out of business, simply used whatever tape they had on hand. Quite naturally, it has been assumed that Dr. Marcel saw the tape and mistook it for the \"hiero- glyphics.\" One of the few areas in which the witness was questioned aggressively and repeatedly is the issue of the tape. His response was consistent and detailed, as noted earlier. Dr. Marcel saw no tape on the rod, and he recalls no tape of any sort in the material his father brought home. In an attempt to obtain a sample of the flowered tape, I contacted the Fashion Institute of Tech- nology in Manhattan, whose archivists referred me to the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design, who in turn contacted the Smithsonian Institution. Searches were in vain All of these searches were in vain, so I ap- proached the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, the firm that makes \"Scotch\" and other cello- phane adhesive tapes. I hoped to find at least an adver- tising brochure or engineering specifications for the flowered tape, but MMM had nothing in their files. Brig. Gen. Ramey with what he claimed is the debris found by Maj. Marcell near Roswell. This is an area which the skeptics, and particularly the U.S. Air Force with its immense resources, should have pursued and can still pursue. But if we are to take Dr. Marcel's testimony seriously, it is a dead issue. What- ever his \"hieroglyphics\" were, it is now, clear that they were not the flowered tape of which Moore speaks. Referring again to the photograph of the de- bris on General Ramey's floor, we see a number of the balsa wood sticks, some covered by the paper-foil, others nearly bare. The irregularly spaced daubs of black glue used to adhere the paper-foil to the sticks are plainly visible. Although various sticks are shown, and arranged at varying angles to the light source, there is no evidence of the shadows that would be caused by an \"I\" beam shape. Nor is there anything like flowers or other markings evident on the sticks. And where is the flowered tape? In front of General Ramey's right foot lies a pile of rubble that is the remains of the balloon that lifted the radar target. Its condition is consistent with the quick deterioration of these balloons in sunlight. All sides in this debate have long since stipulated that the balloons were not part of what excited Maj. Marcel,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1998 Page 17 or what his son saw. But did Major Marcel bring home the balloon as well as the other debris? And if not, why not? Why is the balloon on the General's floor? The \"Bakelite\" The \"bakelite\" was thin like the \"metal foil,\" and very smooth. Dr. Marcel handled small pieces, all of them obviously broken from larger segments. He remembers the jagged edges, and concluded that they resulted from the process of breaking. The pieces were all flat and he recalls no lips or other structural devia- tions from flatness. I do not believe he was asked di- rectly if there were any markings on these pieces, but the inference is that there were none. Compared to the amount of \"metal foil,\" there was very little of the \"bakelite.\" Bakelite was a primitive form of plastic used in the 1940s, and was found in kitchen cabinets, knife handles, enclosures for small radios, and the like. Be- cause it had excellent electrical insulating properties and was easily formed by drilling and sawing, bakelite became a favorite material of radio hobbyists. An excellent judge Dr. Marcel made it clear that he used the term \"bakelite\" only as his closest approximation to the material, and definitely not as a positive identification. He was in an excellent position to judge whether it was bakelite because he had sawed bakelite and men- tioned the unusual smell produced by bakelite when it is sawed. When Dr. Marcel mentioned this smell, Dr. Hibler asked if any of the material in the kitchen had an odor. Dr. Marcel remembers none. A likely candidate for the source of the \"bakelite\" would be the plastic containers of kerosene ballast carried by the array. However, these were egg-shaped with no straight surfaces, and were made of clear plexiglass. Dr. Marcel's \"bakelite\" was flat, opaque, and coal black. Jeffrey concludes that the \"bakelite\" was the covering of an instrument package. The instrument package was in the upper portion of the Mogul array, which even the skeptics agree was not part of what Mac Brazel found. The package consisted of a sonobuoy microphone and its transmitter. The trans- mitter was enclosed in a box only three by five by five inches, which was probably constructed of sheet metal to minimize weight. In any event, if what Dr. Marcel handled were the shards of the bakelite cabinet of an instrument package, one would expect to find square ends, straight sides and other signs of workmanship such as drilled holes. Warrant Officer Irving Newton Warrant Officer Irving Newton was a meteo- rologist assigned to General Ramey's staff, and was mentioned in newspaper reports of Ramey's press con- ference. Thus he was sought out and interviewed by William Moore, co-author of the first book on the Roswell Event. According to Newton, he received a call from the General asking him to come to his office at once. When he arrived, he was shown the debris on the floor and asked to identify it for the General and the as- sembled reporters. He was able to tell them without hesitation that the material consisted of a weather bal- loon and its radar target. Easy identification Here is the relevant portion of Moore's text that is in quotation marks, and presumably Newton's exact words: \"It was cut and dried. I had sent up thousands of them and there is no doubt that what I was given was parts of a balloon. I was later told that a major from Roswell had identified the stuff as a flying sau- cer, but the General had been suspicious of this iden- tification from the beginning, and that's why I had been called.\" Text: But wouldn't the people at Roswell have been able to identify a balloon on their own? Newton: \"They certainly should have. It was a regular Rawin- sonde. They must have seen hundreds of them. \" Text: What happened after your identification of the object? Newton: \"When I had identified it as a balloon, I was dismissed.\" Ten years later, Kevin Randle interviewed Newton at length. The basic story as it appears in the Moore-Berlitz book did not change. Note that in the 1979 version, Newton arrives abruptly, does his job, and departs: \"I was dismissed.\" Randle asked Newton if he had met Major Marcel. This was asked and an- swered twice during the taped interview, and on both occasions Newton denied ever having met Marcel. This should be enough, and it is entirely consistent with what he told Moore: \"I was later told that a major from Roswell...\" Story changes Five years after the Randle interview, in corre- spondence with Robert Todd and C. B. Moore, New- ton changed his story in a remarkable way. Now he clearly recalled meeting Maj. Marcel in the General's office. Moreover, the major had pestered Newton, in- sisting that the weather balloon and radar target on the office floor were actually parts of a spacecraft. Also, that Maj. Marcel had insisted that markings on the balsa wood sticks were alien hieroglyphics. Maj. Marcel told interviewers that he was or- dered not to talk to anyone at the press conference. Why would he violate that order and engage in un- seemly dispute with a man five military grades junior to him? In any event, we have already established be- yond reasonable doubt that the debris he brought home from the Foster Ranch was not the debris in Gen."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 February 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Ramey's office. Thus the topic that Newton claims was urged on him by Marcel is unlikely to have been raised, even if they had conversed. Still another addition And finally, in recent conversation with Jef- frey, Newton has produced still another striking addi- tion to his story. Rather than paraphrase it, I will re- produce Mr. Jeffrey's account: In one of my conversations with Newton, quite by chance, a new and important revelation came to light. He was describing the color of the symbols on one of the balsa sticks and mentioned how it was faint and had somewhat of a mottled appearance because of \"the way that the dye had bled through onto the surface of the stick. \" This was a very important piece of information. The symbols that Newton saw on the debris in Ramey 's office were on the surface of the stick, not on tape! The tape had apparently peeled away, probably because of several weeks' exposure to sunlight while it lay out in the desert. This serendipitous revelation immediately cleared up one of the biggest questions in my mind about the Roswell case — how could Jesse Marcel, Sr., or Jesse Marcel, Jr., for that matter, not have recog- nized flower patterns on tape? The answer is now crys- tal clear. The symbols they saw were not on tape. What they saw were images of the original symbols from the dye that had bled through before the tape had peeled away. Jesse, Jr.'s testimony about the symbols definitely not being on tape was absolutely correct. A remarkable resemblance? Under the heading \"A Remarkable Resem- blance,\" Mr. Jeffrey introduces the drawing made by the same artist who did the Dr. Marcel drawings, and juxtaposes it with the only one of the three interroga- tion drawings he chooses to share with the reader. Mr. Jeffrey does not tell us why, if he went to the trouble of arranging this professional meeting with the artist, he failed to take the logical next step and include a ses- sion with the FBI hypnotist, Dr. Hibler. If nothing else, the forensic psychologist might have been able to elu- cidate what appears from the record to be an ever- changing story about what Newton saw, whom he met, and so on. Refer once again to the photograph of the de- bris on the office floor, and keep in mind that this is precisely the debris about which Irving Newton is speaking. There is tape clearly visible on the edges of the paper-foil. It is particularly obvious on the portions of the paper-foil on the left side of the photograph, appearing as a strip of light color perhaps one inch wide strongly contrasting with the duller metallic foil. The strips extend the entire length of the sides of the paper-foil segments. That is consonant with their function in adding strength to the bond between the paper-foil and the balsa sticks. Examine that tape with care. Are there any symbols on it? (In a previous sec- tion I discussed the absence of symbols on the many balsa sticks that appear in the photograph.) Plainly, an examination of all the J. Bond Johnson photographs under maximum possible mag- nification should be accomplished. This idea is not original with me. I got it from Mr. Jeffrey several years ago, apparently before he had decided such research is irrelevant. I have been told, but can't confirm, that the Johnson photographs were studied by the National Security Agency's photographic laboratory in connec- tion with the Air Force Roswell investigation. Report- edly, no \"flowers\" or \"hieroglyphics\" were found. Regular military tape By all accounts the tape used in these radar reflectors was a cellophane adhesive tape. In fact, the military specifications are available, and that is exactly what they call for. Cellophane tape is impermeable. That's one of the reasons customers buy it today, and the reason it was specified for the radar targets, which were expected to endure flight through heavy moisture and to be stored in damp places. How can a printed or embossed pattern on the outer (non-sticky) surface of such tape \"bleed through\" to the other side? It would then have to \"bleed through\" the adhesive, as well, before imprinting itself, with remarkably intact outlines, if we are to credit Irving Newton's rendition. And upon what surface would this faithful re- production of the tape images be painted? Not a po- rous wood surface, which might conceivably hold such an image, but if we believe Mr. Jeffrey, a surface so hardened by impregnated glue that it is indistinguish- able from metal. And if this dye is so unstable that it can bleed through, why did it not simply bleed off first and long before? That question applies both to the origi- nal tape and then to the wood sticks. Finally, C. B. Moore and the others who unarguably did handle and examine reflectors with flowered tape remember the decoration as flowered, not as Newton's series of abstract figures, which ap- pear recently contrived to look like Dr. Marcel's. An- other hint that the Newton depiction is contrived is the way his figures are slightly offset from the center of the stick, as if to make his \"bleed through\" version more believable. But recall that Dr. Marcel's \"hiero- glyphics\" were exactly centered in the indented area within the lips of the \"I beam.\" If the same standards were applied to Irving Newton's testimony that have been applied to other Roswell \"witnesses\" such as Frank Kauffman, Glenn Dennis and Jim Ragsdale, we would consider his word of little worth. Next month: The conclusion."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1998 Page 19 American documents: The Twining letter By Gildas Bourdais Editor's Note: This is Part Two of an address by Mr. Bourdais at the Primero Forum Mundiai de Ufologia in Brazil, Dec. 7-14,1997, on \"Ameri- can Documents: What Do They Reveal? What Do They Hide?\" Mr. Bourdais is from France. Probably the best known declassified military document affirming the reality of UFOs is the letter of Gen. Nathan Twining of 23 Sept. 1947, secret at the time (Doc 5). General Twining was then the chief of Air Materiel Command (AMC) in Dayton, OH, and he was giving the opinion of AMC to Gen. Schulgen, at the headquarters of Army Air Forces in Washington, on the first big UFO wave of history, of the summer of • 1947. Let's quote it again \"2. It is the opinion that: a. The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious. b. There are objects probably approximating the shape of a disc, of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft.\" This very clear statement was followed by a pre- cise description of the UFOs and of their movements, which I summarize here: • metallic or light reflecting surface, circular or elliptical in shape, flat on bottom and domed on top; • speeds normally above 300 knots (about 500 km/h), extreme rate of climb, evasive action when sighted or contacted by friendly aircraft and radar, ab- sence of trail, normally no associated sound • several reports of well kept formation flights varying from three to nine objects. Confirmation of previous AF report This description of Gen. Twining was confirm- ing a previous Air Force report dated 30 July 1947, which has been released among the FBI documents and which describes UFOs in very similar words, based on eighteen reported sightings: \"Whatever the objects are, this much can be said of their physical appearance: \"The surface of these objects is metallic, indi- cating a metallic skin, at least. \"As to the shape, all observations state that the object is circular or at least elliptical, flat on the bottom and slightly domed on the top. The size esti- mates place it somewhere near the size of a C-54 or a Constellation\" (four-engine planes). \"Flights have been reported, from three to nine of them, flying good formation on each other, with speeds always above 300 knots. \"The discs oscillate laterally while flying along, which could be snaking.\" The letter of Gen. Twining is quite clear on the reality of UFOs, but it leaves open the question of their nature. In a second part of the letter, Twining suggests that they might be some \"high security project\" of do- mestic origin, or a very advanced foreign project. Let's put aside these suppositions for the moment. We will come back to them later when we study the question of deeper secrets. Right now, we can already stress a very simple and important point: we know today without question that the mysterious crafts described by Gen. Twining in 1947 were not man-made crafts, which means that the Twining letter confirms today the presence of non- human crafts in the air space of the United States at that time. It is ironic that this Twining letter was pub- lished as an Appendix of the famous \"Condon Report\" in 1969 (7), at a time when it was already obvious it could not have described man-made crafts. In other words, the Condon report contained, with that letter, a very convincing proof of the reality of UFOs! But here is another document which provides the same kind of proof: The Air Intelligence Report of December 1948 There is another perfectly authentic document of those early years which presents a series of very convincing observations of UFOs. It is the Air Intelli- gence Report No. 100-203-79 called \"Analysis of Fly- ing Object Incidents in the U.S,\" dated 10 Dec. 1948, signed by both the USAF Directorate of Intelligence and the Office of Naval Intelligence (8) (Doc 6). It was classified top secret at the time, and was declassi- fied in 1985. This is a document that nobody will challenge, which presents briefly a selection of more than 20 con- vincing reports as to the reality of UFOs. Here are just a few excerpts from it: [Editor's Note: The July 1985 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 207, contains the complete report.] \"During April 1947, two employees of the Weather Bureau Station at Richmond, Virginia, re- ported seeing a strange metallic disk on three occa- sions through the theodolite while making PIBAL ob- servations. One observation was at 15,000 feet when a"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 20 February 1998 MUFON UFO Journal disk was followed for 15 seconds. The disk appeared metallic, shaped something like an ellipse with a flat bottom and a round top. It appeared below the balloon and was much larger in size.\" Five or six circular objects \"While Hying at 10,000 feet on a course of 300 degrees, 30 miles northwest of Lake Meade, Nevada, an Air Force lieutenant reported seeing five or six white circular objects in close formation and traveling at an estimated speed of 285 miles per hour. This sighting occurred on 28 June 1947.\" \"The following day, a party of three, two of them scientists, were motoring along Highway 17 towards White Sands. New Mexico, V-2 firing grounds and reported seeing a large disk or sphere moving horizon- tally at a high speed and an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. It was of uniform shape and had no protruding surfaces such as wings. The object was in sight for about 60 seconds before it disappeared to the north- east. The three observers agreed on the details of the sighting except that one thought he had seen vapor trails.\" \"On 1 July 1948, twelve disks were reported over Rapid City Air Base, by Major Hammer. These disks were oval-shaped, about 100 feet long, flying at a speed estimated to be in excess of 500 mph. De- scending from 10,000 feet, these disks made a 30-de- gree to 40-degree climbing turn accelerating very rap- idly until out of sight.\" \"On 17 July 1948, a report from Kirtland Air Force base describes a sighting in the vicinity of San Acacia, New Mexico, of seven unidentified objects fly- ing in a \"J\" formation at an estimated height of 20,000 feet above the terrain. The formation varied from \"J\" to \"L\" to circle after passing the zenith. Flashes from the objects were observed after passing 30 degrees be- yond the zenith, but there was no smoke or vapor trail. If the reported altitude is correct the speed was esti- mated at 1,500 miles per hour (2,400 km/h), according to the report.\" How many reports like these did they have at the time, and, how many of them could they explain? They answer: \"Investigations conducted by Headquarters, Air Materiel Command, have definitely established the identification of 18 of approximately 210 so-called fly- ing saucers which have been reported.\" 91% unexplained This means that about 91 % of these sightings could not be explained! The Air Intelligence report gives a general description of the flying disks very close to the one in the Twining letter; \"a. Most of the objects are thin-disk, round on top, and flat on the bottom. The front half of the disk is often circular, sweeping back to a square tail across the full width. \"b. A high rate of climb as well as the apparent ability to remain motionless or hover for a consider- able length of time is indicated. \"c. Reported sizes have varied from that of a 25 cent piece to 250 feet diameter, and from the size of a pursuit plane to the bulk of six B-29 airplanes. \"d. Speeds have been estimated throughout the entire range from very slow or hovering to supersonic. \"e. Sounds and visual trails are not normally as- sociated with the sightings.\" A peculiar detail? There is a peculiar detail here, the observation of very small objects (25-cent piece) which may seem to lower the credibility of the report, but one of the cases cited is the famous dogfight of pilot George Gorman with a very small light, about six to eight inches in diameter according to this reliable witness. There are other cases, notably in the FBI files, of encounters with very small luminous objects, so that they have to be included in the general picture. They also remind us of the mysterious '\"foo-fighters\" of World War II. An interesting aspect of these testimonies should be stressed: many of the UFOs seem to make a delib- erate show of themselves, as if they were at an air pa- rade. In fact this is one of the main characteristics of ufology, since half a century now: a peculiar mix of deliberate showing and of camouflage, as if the goal were to make themselves known progressively, but al- ways leaving room for doubt. Another obvious fact is that the governments of the world have done little to remove these doubts. In fact, the American documents prove that a policy of systematic debunking of UFOs was implemented after the recommendations of the Robertson panel in 1953.

Webb ° ~ 0 ° o First quarter — March 5 C March 1998 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mercury has its best evening appearance of the year from mid to late March when it shows up low in the W after sunset. Though the Sun's closest planet never strays very far from the solar glare, it reaches its farthest point E of the Sun on the 19th (magnitude 0.2). Use binoculars to find the tiny orange object at dusk. Saturn is about 5 degrees to Mercury's left. Mars (magnitude 1.2), in Pisces, fades in the W at dusk, setting about an hour after the Sun in mid- March. Saturn (0.5), in Pisces, lies low in the W at twi- light and by late in the month sets only about an hour after the Sun. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-4.4) rises in the ESE about 3:45 in mid- March, achieving its farthest point W of the Sun on the 27th. But it is rather low in the sky. The radiant planet lies near the crescent Moon on March 24. Jupiter (-2.0), in Aquarius, emerges in the east- ern twilight sky for southern observers late in the month. Moon Eclipse: On the night of March 12-13, for observers throughout the U.S., the full moon slides through the Earth's faint outer penumbral shadow from 9:14 p.m. to 1:26 a.m. (EST). A slight darkening of the Moon's lower section will be noticed, especially during mid- eclipse at 11:20 p.m. <J Full moon—March 12 LJ Last quarter—March 21 New moon—March 27 The Stars: Orion and the Winter Circle remain prominent in the SW midevening sky. Meanwhile, springtime con- stellations continue to appear on the heavenly stage in the E—Leo the Lion (with its brightest star Regulus), kite-shaped Bootes the Herdsman (with star Arcturus), Y-shaped Virgo the Maiden (with Spica), and inconspicuous Hydra the Sea Serpent, which sprawls across the SE heavens beneath Leo and Virgo. In the eastern half of the U.S. after sunset on March 4, the quarter Moon occults the Ist-magnitude star Aldebaran (in Taurus the Bull) between about 7 and 8:30 p.m. (EST). The exact times and durations the star remains hidden depend upon one's location. Central time zone durations vary from around 6 to 7 p.m. at Chicago to about 5:30 to 7 p.m. in Texas. The event, however, begins before sunset in Texas and points W. Be sure to find Aldebaran (best done with binoculars) in advance so the star can be followed near the Moon's bright side.

UFO SIGHTING REPORTS DISTRIBUTION In order to publish more current UFO sighting re- ports in the Journal, the Board of Directors recog- nized that there are too many people handling and approving reports, creating delays before they reach T. David Spencer, the Deputy Director, Investigation. David is the gentleman responsible for entering the re- ports into our database. It is imperative that the reports have been properly investigated at the source by the Field Investigator and the pertinent information se- cured from the witness. Since the State Director is closer to the Field Investigator than the Regional Directors, we want all State Directors to send their screened and approved sighting reports directly to T. David Spencer, 6700 Woodcrest, Austin, TX 78759. This revision is an ex- periment to speedup our approval system of reports. If we find that it is successful, the Field Investigator's Manual will be revised accordingly. MUFON MERCHANDISE MUFON has been selling speciality merchandise at our UFO INFORMATION CENTER in Seguin, TX, each depicting the MUFON logo. These same items are listed on our Web site. Now we want to make them available to everyone via the Reader's Classified in the Journal. The list is confined to T-shirts from S through XL, coffee mugs, ball caps (2 colors), battery operated wall clocks, and alien jewelry. The T-shirts are white cotton with the MUFON logo printed on the front in royal blue. Please see the Reader's Classifieds for ordering details. SUCCESSION TO INTERNATIONAL DIRECTOR Several members have inquired concerning the MU- FON Bylaws provision for the replacement of the International Director should a vacancy occur. (1) The International Director may be replaced at any time by a two-thirds vote of the entire Board of Directors. (2) If a vacancy is created due to the death of the International Director, the Deputy Director of Administration (presently John F. Schuessler) auto- matically assumes this responsibility until the next annual Board of Director's Meeting. (3) The Board of Directors are delegated the responsibility to elect a new International Director, preferably from the current board members. (4) If the International Director should resign for any reason steps 2 and 3 would be imple- mented. Concurrent with this election, the logistics of mov- ing the MUFON headquarters to another city will con- stitute a difficult, but not an insurmountable task.
