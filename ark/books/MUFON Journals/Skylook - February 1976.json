Short Editor-Publisher Emeritus Leu Stringf ield Commentary Editor's Column Part two of the saga of Travis Walton is included in this issue. It is interesting to read the reports of APRO, NICAP, and GSW (Ground Saucer Watch), but it is also frustra- ting. APRO indicates the case involves a valid sighting and abduction, while NICAP and GSW feel the abduction portion of the story, at least, is a hoax or \"a psychological phenomena.\" On the surface it appears that APRO, while not first on the scene, ultimately produced the best-qualified consultants to aid in the investigation. Perhaps they also entered the case with less initial skepti- cism, which, whatever its pos- sible demerits, made APRO more acceptable to the Waltons. NICAP apparently questions the sighting itself, saying that the polygraph tests of the witnesses were not conclusive. GSW seems to accept the sight- ing portion, but not the abduc- tion story. It is interesting that GSW and NICAP question the back- ground of the Waltons, empha- sizing what GSW indicates is an obsession with UFOs, while APRO contends the Waltons had only a minor interest in UFOs prior to the sighting. What are the sources for these varying re- ports on the witnesses? Obviously, this sort of var- iation between the findings of established UFO groups does little to encourage confidence in cooperative ventures involv- ing investigations, since one group would naturally question the approach and competence of another. Likewise, the general public is likely to wonder why major groups investigating the same case have come up with op- posite findings. Whatever the results, all groups involved deserve a vote of thanks for releasing at least the main details of their investigations, rather than saving them for a future book or \"technical report,\" or de- laying release on the pretext that the case has not been com- pleted.

Texan says truck buffeted, lights went out Two occupants in craft Date of sighting: May 3,1975. Location of sighting: San Antonio, Texas. Investigated by: Gary Graber. By Gary Graber On the evening of May 3, 1975, Mr. Alois Olenick, 48, was westbound on Mogford Road south of San Antonio at approx- imately -9:15 p.m. when his ve- hicle, a 1959 Chevy pickup, was approached, spotlighted, and nearly buffeted off the road by an unidentified craft carrying two occupants, he said. Mr. Olenick states that he was driving to a nearby store when he noticed a strange amber colored object \"rise rapidly upward\" from a grove of trees about 900 yards into the pas- ture adjoining the road. This object then approached the Ole- nick vehicle \"at a terrific rate of speed, losing altitude\" as it closed on the pickup. During this rapid approach, the primary light on the front of the vehicle changed from amber to a \"bright, cherry red,\" becoming most intense during the close encounter. Says Olenick, \"When the craft got directly over the top of my pickup my lights went complete- ly out and my engine was dead. And as I was trying to get out of the pickup, I thought it was a chopper passing on top of me, at first, it happened so quick. Then when they hovered over the top of me and I got a good look at it, I knew it was no chop- per. I thought to myself, \"That's got to be a UFO.\" Globular shape As the object hung in place above the pickup, Monk Olenick saw a craft globular in shape with two roughly conical pro- trusions, that may have consti- tuted a shelf-like projection encircling the transparent upper section. The bottom of the vehicle was \"highly polish- ed metal\" that cast a reddish glow, possibly as a result of reflection from the primary red light. (Possibly due to air glow)? Olenick told this investi- gator that the hovering phase of the encounter, during which- he clearly observed two occu- pants, was on the order of only 10-20 seconds. During this time, however, the vehicle was tipped at an estimated 37-40 degree slant and oriented so that one of the occupants was directly in Ole- nick \"s line of sight. The transparent upper portion through which they were seen also seemed to be backlit with a diffuse reddish light, making details of the occupants' fea- tures quite plain. \"They appeared to be just as interested in me as I was in them,\" Olenick says. \"One of the occupants, the one farthest away from me, appeared to be the pilot and had his hands on what looked like controls. He was looking up and away from me. The other occupant looked directly at me, a side view right at my windshield, and ap-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"peared to be observing me. Got a good look \"I got a good look at both of them. They weren't human beings like we see here.\" When asked to describe their physi- cal appearance, Monk stated that \"they couldn't have been big men, probably not over 5 feet tall. They were bald, with long prominent ears, and a long nose. Their eyes did not appear very plainly, they just looked like slits.\" (INVESTI- GATOR'S NOTE: there is a pos- sibility here that more promi- nent eyes were covered by lids or protective membranes, a- gainst the glare, giving only the appearance of slits.) Olenick added that their skin was \"not like our skin; it appeared to me to look sort of like sharkskin, sort of a grey color.\" He also noted that the skin was tight and firm, with- out wrinkles. The two occu- pants had a wiry, firm build, but he could see only a 1 portion of the arms and upper torso. .Olenick never got a \"look at the hands of either occupant. They appeared to be resting on controls below a dash-like panel, above which he could see several apparently T-shaped handles. The witness also seemed certain that neither of the oc- cupants was wearing a headset or other such apparatus. The only possible article of cloth- ing might have been a shirt- like garment on the torso, made of material like leather. He is not sure about this point, however. \"It was over so fast that I have to think carefully about the details.\" No motor noise Olenick says that he watched the object depart. \"There was no motor noise during the time it was over my truck, just a whirring (shriek) of wind. It was very loud; it sounded to me like a cyclone, and I've been in a lot of storms. I did not hear any engines whatsoever, no Sketch drown from witness descrip- tion and verified by witness as a close resemblance. whir as from engines.\" He says he saw the bottom of the craft as it \"took off straight up. There was a ter- rible thrust that buffeted my pickup and then it vanished al- most instantly.\" When asked if he felt the .object actually vanished or merely turned off its lights while leaving very fast, Olenick had no real opin- ion. \"It was just like turning off a light bulb. It happened instantly.\" Several additional details are worth noting. Olenick no- ticed a \"very (strong) severe odor, like burning copper or electrical wiring\" as the craft hovered over his truck. He states that this odor persisted in his truck for a long period after the incident. The witness also suffered eye strain (and possible slight damage) from the intense red light present on the craft. At the time of .the interview, on Aug. 22, the witness (who works on an outside sheet metal job) was still wearing dark glasses to protect his eyes and prevent headaches. He experienced no physiolog- ical effects during the en- counter, such as paralysis. Other than emotional stress and prolonged nervousness, which may or may not have had a phys- ical cause, Olenick has proba- bly had no other lasting ef- fects from the encounter. \"I feel like they got a look at me, and maybe got my picture or something, and then turned their lights off and vanished.\" be points years answered, seem for instance, Questions remain There are a number of ques- tions regarding this case and other sightings in the area stretching back several that remain to Some positive clear, however. The police, did log a report from the Ole- nicks at 9:30 p.m. on May 3, and responded within 20 min- utes. This was probably due to both the agitation of the Olenicks and the fact that the police were interested in any possible connections with the rash of mutilations in their territory (as they told the Olenicks). Despite several previous un- explainable sightings, this is the first report made by the Olenicks or their neighbors. Like other citizens of San An- tonio, which has at least three major Air Force bases, the Ole- nicks are familiar with the types of aircraft they often see. The likelihood that Alois Olenick could have misidenti- fied a helicopter seems extrem- ely slim even if we disregard the reported electrical effects and descriptions of the occu- pants. A helicopter, even at night, would have shown many details of superstructure, the characteristic air chop of the blades, and a distinct motor whineâ€”none of which was re- ported even at close range. It is this investigator's opinion that the majority of events happened as related and that Mr. Olenick has sincerely done his best to accurately describe the sequence of events that occurred. His account on Aug. 22 was nearly identical to that printed in THE SAN ANTONIO LIGHT on May.5, two days after the event. Further field investigation is needed to verify air traffic patterns on the night of this sighting and to expand the list of other possible witnesses to sightings in the area in the recent past."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Travis Walton case continues APRO, NICAP, GSW reports disagree The APRO BULLETIN for Novem- ber, which was received Feb. 4, has what is apparently the lat- est and probably the most de- tailed information on the Travis Walton case. (See Decem- ber SKYLOOK for the basic story.) Additional details of the case as reported in the APRO BULLETIN include the fol- i lowing: The object allegedly seen by the seven-man forestry crew south of Heber, AZ, on Nov. 5, 1975, at approximately 6:15 p. m. glowed like \"a Coleman lan- tern just being lit.\" The glow of the object was interrupted by dark, opaque dividers or a framework. (See sketch on page 6 of December SKYLOOKV) Walton had jumped from the truck carrying the workers, not waiting for the truck to come to a halt, and walked quickly toward the object, which was hovering over a pile of brush. As Walton approached the ob- ject, other workers in the- truck heard a \"beeping\" noise which sounded like a warning buzzer in the passenger section of a commercial airliner. Then, as Walton stood looking up at the hovering object, there was a sound described as like a generator starting, and addi- .tional rumbling noises. At this point the object be- &i gan oscillating or wobbling a- bout its vertical axis. Sud- denly a bright narrow ray of ( greenish-blue light came from the object, striking Walton. He was raised about 12 inches into the air, knocked backward, his arms were thrown outward, and his head was knocked back. The crew, terrified, hurried- ly left. One witness said he saw Walton fall back to the ground. Approximately one- fourth of a mile away, the crew stopped, looked back, and saw a light rise and streak to the northeast. They decided to re- turn to the scene, arriving a- bout 15 minutes later. Neither Walton nor the object could be seen. The frightened crew then rushed into 'Heber, 15 miles north, and reported the experi- ence to Deputy Chuck Allison a- bout 7:35 p.m. Allison said the men were very upset, and that one was weeping. He is quoted as saying that if the witnesses were lying \"they were damned good actors.\" Despite extensive searches by the authorities, Walton could not be found, and he was listed as a missing person Nov. 7. (Three of the witnesses had returned to'the scene with the authorities, while three re- fused.) The witnesses submitted to a polygraph (lie detector) test administered on Nov. 10 by polygraph expert Cy Gilson of the Arizona Department of Pub- lic Safety. Five of the wit- nesses \"passed\" the test, while the sixth (Allen Dalis, 21) was judged \"inconclusive.\" Gilson reportedly considers it impos- sible for that many persons to lie without being detected by the polygraph procedure. He indicated that perhaps Dalis had not seen the entire inci- dent. According to Deputy Allison, tests by the Sheriff's Depart- ment showed no unusual radia- tion at the scene pf the sight- ing. Bill Spaulding of Ground Saucer Watch, one of the first researchers on the scene, said he detected \"high residual mag- netism\" at the site. Walton .returns In the early hours of Nov. 11, Walton, missing for more than five days, reportedly called his sister's house from a phone booth at a service station in Heber. Slowly, Wal- ton's story of being aboard a UFO came out: After being'knocked uncon- scious by the light beam from the UFO, he said he regained consciousness and found himself lying on his back on a table. The lighted ceiling seemed very close to him. There was some sort of apparatus lying on his chest, and he felt pain in his head and body. The air seemed moist and heavy, and it was difficult to breathe. Three entities were present. He described them as being a- bout five feet tall, with large eyes, no hair, small noses, small mouths, and small ears. Walton said they reminded him of human fetuses. All were dressed in what appeared to be loose-fitting brown coveralls. Frightened, Walton said he jumped up, knocking the appara- tus from his chest; he said the apparatus rocked back and forth on the floor. He struck out at the creatures, who seemed not to be disturbed. However, they did leave the room. Walton says he also left the room, went through a corridor, and found another room. In this room was a chair with push but- tons on the arms and what ap- peared to be a transparent wall (what seemed to be stars were visible). He sat in the chair, pushed some of the buttons, and the \"stars\" seemed to move, so he quit pushing buttons. A humanoid appears Soon a man wearing blue clothing and a transparent hel- met entered the room, gesturing to Walton to come with him. Smiling, but refusing to re- spond to Walton's questions, the man took Walton out of the craft, through an \"airlock,\" and down a ramp. The lighting was now brighter, the air fresh, and breathing was easi- er. Walton now found himself in a large enclosure containing several disc-shaped objects. The man took Walton to an-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"other craft, where he saw three more humanoidsâ€”a woman and two menâ€”who closely resembled one another. They also wore blue clothing, like his guide, but had no helmets. The guide left the craft, without removing his helmet. At this point something sim- ilar to an oxygen mask was placed on Walton's face and he again lost consciousness. When he regained consciousness the second time he was lying on his back on the cold surface of a road. He felt heat from a disc- shaped object which he saw ris- ing into the sky; doors on the bottom of the object were clos- ing. Walton recognized the road as being the one leading to Heber, so he walked into town and called his sister's home. He had been in the UFO just over five days, according to his account. After Bill Spaulding left this case, following difficul- ties with Travis Walton and his brother Duane, APRO took over the investigation. The NATIONAL ENQUIRER agreed to pay expenses involved in keeping Walton in a Phoenix hotel sequestered from the press until he could regain his composure. The APRO investigation Dr. James Harder, APRO direc- tor of research and one of -two key investigators handling the Pascagoula case in 1973, ar- rived on Nov. 13. Harder re- portedly used hypnotic tech- niques to relieve some of Wal- ton's tension. An analysis of a urine spec- imen (Spaulding had requested that the first urine sample taken after Walton's return be saved) and a blood sample tak- en Nov. 13 from Walton showed \"absolutely no evidence of drug use.\" (One individual involved in the case early had suggested the possibility that Walton had been hallucinating as a result of drugs.) APRO says Walton did not take the polygraph test as scheduled because \"the press had literal- 6 From CONSERVATION NEWS, National Wildlife Federation (sent by Paul Cerny) ly laid seige to Duane 1 s home and were camped at the building where the test was to be admin- istered and Duane did not feel his brother was ready to face the press.\" APRO says that Duane's judg- ment \"was vindicated later by three psychiatrists...who said that a polygraph test at that time would be meaningless. The polygraph measures stressâ€”not lies--and Travis Walton was in a very distressed state during the two weeks following his or- deal.\" The Rorschach (inkblot) test has been administered to Walton by Dr. Harold A. Cahn, a physi- ologist and APRO's consultant on parapsychology. The test reportedly indicates that Wal- ton \"is not highly suggestible, and has good, normal basic per- sonality structure.\" The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory test was conducted on Walton by Lament McConnell on Dec. 16. This test indicated that Walton was nor- mal and showed no deviations pointing to phychosis. Jim Lorenzen, international director of APRO, says there"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"has been no change in any de- tail of Walton's story to date. APRO also says that, despite reports to the contrary, Walton and his mother, Mrs. Mary Kel- let, are not UFO buffs. Walton \"had a mild interest in the subject,\" according to APRO. Also characterized as inaccur- ate was a report that Mrs. Kellet had said upon learning of Walton's disappearance that she did not expect to see him again. NICAP's investigation NICAP has apparently taken a somewhat different view of the case, according to the January issue of the UFO INVESTIGATOR. The NICAP article begins as follows: \"As with all contactee cases, the alleged abduction of a 22- year-old forestry service crew member has created undue ex- citement and interest through- oug the country.\" NICAP says that its investi- gator, Dr. William S. Bickel, questions the lie dectector (polygraph) test which was ad- ministered to Walton's five companions. According to Bick- el, the test was given in three parts: (1) Was any witness involved with foul play or angry at Travis Walton? (The polygraph test was given at the time Wal- ton was still missing.) (2) Did any witness know if anyone else was involved with foul play? (3) What did each witness see? Bickel says that correct an- swers to parts one and two of the test constitutes \"passing the lie detector test,\" even though part three is failed completely. He considers part three to be the only relevant question, however, so far as the abduction is concerned. NICAP also reports that Sheriff Marlin Gillespie said that Walton had called the MC of a radio talk show before the abduction and volunteered to appear on the show. The MC reportedly called Walton a \"kpok.\" Following the. alleged abduction, Walton reportedly again called the MC and asked, \"Who's a kook now?\" (It should be noted that this information may or may not be correct.) Based on these reports, NICAP concludes: \"These.facts natur- ally throw the case under great suspicion, and it would seem that either a hoax has been committed or that a psychologi- cal phenomena is involved.\" GSW conclusions On Feb, 6 SKYLOOK received a final report from Ground Saucer Watch, Inc. (GSW) which also concluded the abduction was a hoax. This GSW report included the following comments: 'The six witnesses were given lie detector (polygraph) tests, with five of the tests indicat- ing they were telling the truth about what they saw. The sixth test was' inconclusive. Some of the questions asked included, \"Did you kill Travis Walton,\" and \"Did you see Travis taken aboard a spacecraft?\" They all answered \"No.\" Inconclusive data. Walton was scheduled to take a lie detector test on Nov. 14 at the Arizona : Department of Public Safety (DPS) headquar- ters in Phoenix, but failed to show up. He'has never taken a polygraph test! Sheriff Gil- lespie issued a statement say- ing no further attempts will be made by his office or by the DPS to administer a lie detec- tor test to Walton.' Gillespie said earlier that he had doubts about Walton's' story based upon an interview with Walton on Nov. 11. William Spaulding, director of GSW, said he also had in- formation that led him to doubt Walton's story. Spaulding ter- minated the investigation by his group 'due to Walton's re- fusal to submit to scientific testing, including an interview with Dr. J. Allen Hynek. Dr. Lester Steward, a con- sultant for GSW and MUFON, in- terviewed Duane and Travis Wal- ton and said their behavior made him suspicious of their story..They refused profession- al testing and evaluations. An on-site investigation of where the UFO was reportedly seen was conducted by experi- enced GSW field investigators, and high residual magnetism measurements were recorded. No indications of any radiation phenomena were observed or mea- sured -, nor were there any ground markings, including heat affected areas. GSW Evaluation: After a time-consuming in- vestigation, the,Travis Walton case is considered a hoax based on the following: 1) Walton never boarded the UFO. This fact is supported by the six witnesses and the poly- graph test results. 2) The entire Walton family has had a continual UFO his- tory. The Walton boys have re- ported observing' 10 to 15 sepa- rate UFO sightings (very high). 3) When Duane was questioned about his brother's disappear- ance, he stated that \"Travis will be found,\" that \"UFO's are friendly.\" GSW countered, \"How do you know Travis will be found?\" Duane said, \"I have a' feeling, a strong feeling.\" GSW asked, \"If the UFO 'captors' are going to return Travis, will you have a camera to re- cord this great occurrence?\" Duane, \"No, if I have a camera 'they' will not return.\" 4) The Waitons' mother showed no outward emotion over the 'loss 1 of Travis. She said that UFO's will not harm her son; he will be returned and that UFO's have been seen by her family many times. 5) The Waltons refused any outside scientific 1 help or any- one who logically doubted the abduction portion of the story. 6) The media and GSW were fair to the witnesses. However, when the story started to \"fall apart\" the Waltons would talk only to people who did not doubt the abduction story. 7) The Waltons \"sold\" their story to the NATIONAL ENQUIRER and the story was completely twisted'from the truth."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"California report The mystery helicopters By Ann Druffel Gradually, over a period of two or three years, there have been hints of helicopters of unknown source connected with UFO and possible UFO-related incidents. Are these cases merely coincidence or misident- ifications, or is there, in- deed, mysterious .helicopter surveillance of UFOs? A startling example occurred on September 3, 1975, in Tunun- ga, California, a mountain com- munity about fifteen miles northeast of Los Angeles civic Center. Nestled in the foot- hills of the Angeles Crest mountains are numerous homes and cabins built on steep, winding roads. . The home of Mr., and Mrs. C. 1 boasts an east to west view of the mountains. About eight o'- clock p.m. Mrs. C; heard a hel- icopter over a nearby canyon. Since the sound-of a helicopter is , often the first sign of jeopardy from brush fires, Mrs. C. stayed out in the yard to watch, accompanied-by Mrs. C. B., her sister, who was visit- ing in the home. .Mrs. C., particularly, is familiar with helicopters at varying heights, since the area is patrolled regularly in this fashion. She was struck by the extreme height at which this copter was flyingâ€”in her esti- mation about 2500 feet. As she watched, she noticed a round, brightly lighted object above the helicopter, an estimated 1200 feet higher up. Intrigued by this hovering â€¢ light, Mrs. C. got binoculars, and she and Mrs. B. took turns looking at the curious object. In the field of the binoculars the object was magnified to about one-half degree angular diameter, or about the size of the full moon. A vari-colored light pattern was clearly, visible. The top 8 was a vibrant blue-green, the middle portion white and the bottom a distinct glowing red. The light pattern encompassed the entire disk, and the whole object was \"very brilliant.\" Helicopter circles below The object remained station- ary in the southeast sky while the helicopter circled below it in a tight surveillance pat- tern, as though studying it. As the two women continued to watch they were amazed to see the object \"changing shape from round, to diamond, to chevron, and into a classic saucer.\" It then started to zigzag over a six-degree area of sky. Mr. C. joined the women in watching the object at this point. This \"snake dance in the sky\" was not caused by eye-jiggle, magnified by the binoculars. She firmly anchored the glasses on a stationary stand to check this. Even without the binocu- lars, the shape changes and the color pattern, plus the frantic gyrations, were visible to the naked eye. After a few minutes of sur- veillance, the helicopter sped off; presently two helicopters returned, flying in tandem. It seemed they were trying to fol- low the object in its wild mo- tions, keeping always a certain distance from it, as though cautious. The gyrations of the object and the movements of the choppers were such that the witnesses were forced to watch from different areas of the yard to keep them in sight. Mrs. C., with the aid of the binoculars, could see into the cabin of the helicopters and noticed a faint red \"flash\" within from time to time. She had seen this same phenomenon at close range during a drug raid in the neighborhood, sev- eral years previous. On that occasion a police helicopter pink flashes from within the cabin. Mrs. C. had been told by a neighbor that the police were taking \"infrared photos\" of the action on the ground. She assumed, therefore, that the flashes noticed during the UFO sighting indicated that the chopper was obtaining photos of the UFO. Eyes start hurting After the first twenty min- utes of the sighting, Mrs. C's eyes began to hurt, and she put on colored glasses, which are designed to show true color. But the entire incident lasted about three hours. The wit- nesses did not watch all that time; Mrs. C. watched more than the others. At about 10:30 she M saw the lights go on at the Nike missile base,\" in the mountains near her home. This was an extremely rare occur- rence, and she wondered if it had something to do with the UFO's being in the area. At about 11:00 the object disap- peared from view in the west, still followed by a chopper. All three witnesses reported that their eyes hurt after the incident. Mrs. C. suffered blurred vision. All three wit- nesses' eyes were streaked with red that night and felt as though sunburned. The next morning they were still flecked with red and felt \"grainy.\" By that afternoon, Sept. 4, their eyes had returned to normal. Mrs. C. stated that all three witnesses seemed \"hypnotized\" by the object. She personally felt \"the object was .focused in on her.\" Although the street on which the Cs live is not isolated, it did not cross their minds to seek additional witnesses. Mrs. C. thought once that the police should be called, but Mr. C. abruptly de- cided it was not necessary. He judged that the authorities"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"were aware of what was going on, because of the helicopters' surveillance. Mrs. C. followed his advice!' -' Looking back on this, Mrs. C. regarded her failure to con- tact the authorities as unusu- al. The next morning she de- termined; to track down a source to which she could report it. She made several' phone calls to public service agencies, and finally was referred to SKYNET by the Griffith Observatory. Use of helicopters denied Checking out the possibility that photos of the UFO might be obtainable, the writer called every known facility involving official and private helicop- ters within .a 300 square-mile radius of Tuj unga. Absolutely no source would admit to sight- ing the UFO, or to having heli- copters in that area at that time. Most of these agencies indicated that only rarely do their choppers fly in tandem, since doing so creates danger- ous air currents. The only helicopter which admitted to being in the area at all was a Los Angeles Police Department craft. The pilot stated that he took off from the LAPD Heli- port at 8:00 p.m. in constant communication with Burbank Air- port. He had no infrared pho- tographic equipment aboard. He remembers traveling up a wash near the scene of the sighting, but it was a straight flight which encompassed only a few minutes. He did not see any other helicopters or any unusu- al object in the sky. However, surveillance helicopter pilots generally look down at the ground, not up at the sky. Regarding the report by Mrs. C. that \"the lights went on at the Nike missile base\" nearby, it was learned from an Air Force Public Information Office that Nike missile bases are no longer operative, having been phased out over the past year. The base in question had been turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers. Why the lights went on at the base during the UFO sighting remains a military secret. *' No infra-red used? During the search for the helicopters' source, inquiries were made at the various offic- ial agencies regarding the use of \"infra-red\" photography, possibly involving faint red flashes. All sources denied that/any type of equipment like this was in .use. In consulting with Adrian Vance, former MUFON photo con- sultant, it was learned that in the 1950's infra-red cameras with red filters over flash bulbs were being used, and that people viewing this camera in operation straight on would see a faint red flash. However, infra-red cameras now in use do not involve any light source visible to an onlooker. This case is strange; equally strange are other mentions of \"mystery helicopter\" in UFO literature. For instance a re- cent NICAP case 2 concerned an oval-shaped object hovering low over a field, seen in Enfield, Connecticut, at 9:30 p.m. on March 4th, 1975. The lights it emitted were blue, green, and red, strangely reminiscent of the Tujunga case. It was moving slowing in an easterly direc- tion and was in full view of two witnesses over a period of forty-five minutes. During the observation the witnesses saw a helicopter flying very close to the object. The NICAP investi- gator and the Enfield Police Department, tried to find out the identity of the copter. All military and private installa- tions were checked; all inquir- ies proved negative. Animal mutilation cases Reports of mystery helicop- ters have been linked with the animal mutilation cases of re- cent months. Whether or not some of these weird events are UFO-linked is still in ques- tion. Although articles have been printed in popular maga- zines 3 claiming proof that the mutilations are performed by satanic cults, the mystery is far from solved in some re- searchers' opinion. Equally as strange as the way some of the animals are drained of blood and mutilated without any traces left in the area are the numerous reports from citi- zens in Kansas, Colorado and other states who have seen hel- icopters hovering over cattle pens and other areas where mut- ilated cattle have been dis- covered. The mystery helicop- ters in the cattle mutilation cases often are described as Army Bell helicopters. They often fly without lights and extremely close to the ground, and in some incidents where they have appeared close to witnesses, no numbers were vis- ible on the craft. What is the ' answer to these seemingly related mysteries.? In the Tujunga case, were there truly two helicopters of un- known origin, flying equipped with 25-year-old cameras? Which can we believeâ€”the rational witnesses or the denials by of- ficial sources? Is it possible that the aerial displays in Tu- junga, California, and Enfield, Connecticut, were from a source inaccessible to civilian re- searchers? Were they from the military complex of the United States? Is there a pattern here? Do other researchers have cases in their files regarding similar incidents? Perhaps it would make an area of specialization for a researcher so inclined. Footnotes report, investigated by Ann Druffel. Contains full identifying information on all witnesses.

The re- ports are titled \"Landing at Aische-en-Refail\" (6 pages) and \"Easter UFO: A SOBEPS Inquiry\" (9 pages). Electro-magnetic effects The landing, in central Bel- gium January 24, involved elec- tro-magnetic effects on a car motor and radio. A few minutes after 4 p.m. on a clear day, Mrs. N.D. was rapidly approaching a hill, driving her Volkswagen 1300 model, when she noticed a red object about 150 m away on the ground to the left of the road. Suddenly her motor began to slow down, and she thought she was running out of gas or had a carburetor problem. Her car continued to slow, the radio went dead (except that its light remained on), and the car coasted to a stop as the motor failed, with the shift still in 4th gear. She was now only about 10 m away from the object, which was about. 1 m in diameter and ^ m high, and had a red flattened dome on top and two rows of \"spots\" around the circumfer- ence (see cover sketch). The surface appeared like unpol- ished metal, non reflective. After 4-5 seconds the UFO began to move, rising about 50 cm, then dropping back to the ground. This action was re- peated a second time. The third time it rose slowly and steadi- ly to 3 or 4 m above the ground and moved above the car, re- vealing a flat, gray, feature- 10 Jose Moniet, above, (and, earlier, his wife) observed a moving object which was white on top and cherry red on the bottom.

It seemed to hover over the car for a few seconds, then re- appeared to the left side and moved away on a curved trajec- tory, but without zig-zags or oscillations, making no sound. Motor restarts itself It was then that the most startling event happened. The car motor restarted by itself without Mrs. N.D. touching the starter and, still in 4th gear, the car began moving forward. The UFO could be seen disap- pearing to the ENE. SOBEPS had investigators on the spot within 48 hours, checking for physical evidence. However, no traces were visible on the hard clay ground and no radioactivity was detected. The SOBEPS investigation included six hours of questioning, and reconstruction of the incident. The car had recently been through a check-up and was in good working order. The witness had nightmares for several days and suffered from \"abnormal lassitude.\" Otherwise, she was unaffected. She was not a UFO believer. Later that spring the car started having problems with the motor misfiring, and was finally taken in for a garage check in July. It then had a faulty distributor which had to be replaced. The Easter UFO On Sunday, April 14, mostly in the same area of central Belgium southeast of Bruxelles, there were widespread and inde- pendent sightings of a UFO be- tween 8 p.m. and midnight.

Two cars of witnesses driv- ing in Hoeilaart saw a large, cylindrical, apparently metal- lic object \"like a dull-gray torpedo\" hovering at tree-top level above the road. Eight to ten lights were visible on the undersurface. Both cars drove directly beneath the UFO with- out incident. The final sighting in the series was about midnight at Les Bulles, where a round, dull gray-brown metallic looking ob- ject moved slowly across the sky from NE to SW. At its front was a blinking red light, and at its rear a steady yellow- white light. The UFO passed low over a nearby farm, illuminat- ing a farm building with a red- dish glow.

This year- end review of local UFO reports was presented by Mr. Leo Wick- linski and Mr. William Chris- tian, two of the group's most active field investigators. In addition, details of a close encounter UFO experience that occurred in November, 1975, were discussed by the principal witness in the event. For some years now, Chris- tian's residence in south St. Louis County has served as a reporting center for persons wishing to report UFO sightings or to request information about the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis. Christian reported that in 1975, a total of 156 telephone calls were received from per- sons reporting UFO observa- tions. These 156 calls were evaluated as follows: Astronomical Phenomena (stars, planets, meteors)....92 Aircraft (advertising air- craft, helicopters, planes,).24 Balloons (all types) 19 Satellites 6 Insufficient Information 5 Unknown (no apparent conven- tional explanation 10 Total: 156 Christian reported that the figure of 10 \"unknowns\" for 1975 was consistent with the percentage of unknowns in pre- vious years, when anywhere from six to ten percent of all calls received remained unexplained. Details of a close encounter UFO experience that occurred on the night of Nov. 15, 1975, were related by the principal witness, Mrs. Betty Prichard. Mrs. Prichard was driving with three companions near Pa- cific, MO, when the incident took place. Shortly after 8 p. m. she and her companions spot- ted a luminous red object hov- ering in the eastern sky. They kept this object in view for several moments and reported seeing a smaller white light emerge from the original ob- ject. Mrs. Prichard estimated that the original object appeared to her to be about as large as a basketball . held at arm's length. (It is felt that this is most likely an exaggeration. Subsequent questioning, of Mrs. Prichard suggested that the ob- ject's apparent (angular) size was probably on the order of 1.5 to 2.0 moon diametersâ€” i.e., about 1 arc-degree. How- ever, this exaggeration by Mrs. Prichard is not considered to diminish the value or credibil- ity of her report, for most persons have a tendency to overestimate angular sizes of objects .in the sky.) Mrs. Prichard reported ex- periencing an unusual impulse to get out of her car and ap- proach the UFO (which remained airborne throughout the experi- ence) , although she did not do so. It was also reported that interference on her car radio . was noted at the time of the UFO experience. Following the incident, Mrs. Prichard contacted the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis. The next afternoon, Mrs. Prichard was interviewed at the site of her UFO experience the night before. A search for physical traces revealed noth- ing out of the ordinary. How- ever, a magnetometer held in the vicinity of Mrs. Prichard's auto (and several other cars, for comparison) indicated an unusual amount of magnetism was present in the car. This incident was investi- gated by Leo Wicklinski, Wil- liam Christian, Erwin Enders, and Thomas Mulligan. A complete report on this case will be submitted at a future date. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In Others' Words By Lucius Parish The Jan. 6 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER featured an article on the Air Force's Project Blue Book files.

Strange reports from Pennsylvania By Stan Gordon Pennsylvania Center for UFO Research Even though most of the re- ports of flying objects that fall into the unexplained cate- gory normally are in excess of ten feet in diameter, there are a number of reports 1 from all corners of the world that des- cribe small, aerial devices ranging in size from about five inches to one foot in diameter. Some of these objects appear solid, while others appear more transparent. These mini UFO's have reportedly been observed during daylight on heavily crowded streets, inside of homes, and even gliding around inside parked cars. it is speculated that,these devices.are remotely controlled and act somewhat like a two-way audio-video transceiver which would be used by the UFO occu- pants of a larger craft to ob- tain various types of informa- tion on the area which they might be studying at that time. Two reports . There have been two reports of these devices in Pennsyl- vania in recent months. The first sighting occurred on Sept. 20, near. Punxatawney. A married couple was cleaning their mobile home about 9 p.m. when the wife pointed out to her husband a strange-looking \"spider web\" that was about eight inches in diameter and shaped like a disc, about two feet outside their back door. They watched it for a few seconds, then realized that it was not a spider web, as it turned on^ it's side and flew from about six feet from the ground, where first observed, to about ten feet into the air. After a few seconds it re- turned to the ground and re- peated the movements and hover- ed over the top of the witness- es' trailer. They noticed no sound. At this point, the wife became disturbed by .this un- wanted guest and took a nearby broom and hit the object, breaking it into two identical smaller devices, and each flew off in a different direction'. Power failure About five minutes after she hit the device, there was re- portedly a complete power fail- ure in the trailer as well as the neighbor's trailer next door that lasted for only a few seconds, and unusual TV inter- ference prior to the power out- age. The second monitor device was reportedly observed by a young housewife in a rural area out- side of Greensburg. At approx- imately 4:30 p.m. oh Oct. 2, the woman began to take down some curtains in her bedroom when she was .shocked to find a metallic, spherical object a- bout a foot in diameter hover- ing just outside her window. The object was described as be- ing a brownish-green color and having spikes sticking out of it on all sides. A low beeping sound emitted from the object. She looked at the object eye to eye for sev- eral seconds when suddenly the device spun slowly around, and with.what looked like an open- ing, pointed at the woman. The object then ascended straight up into the sky and vanished. Virginians report exploding object Several persons in the Emory, VA, area reportedly observed on Sunday, Jan. 18, 1976, a mysterious ball of light that moved across the countryside before exploding. One witness, Mrs. Roy Bar- ret, said the object, \"about as bright as a car's bright lights,\" drifted slowly across the clear sky, passed in front of the moon, moved between two hills, landed, \"glowed for a- while,\" then exploded. \"When it passed in front of the moon,\" said Mrs. Barrett, \"you could see something like gases coming out of it.\" The object was observed about 8 p. m. Dan Ryan, assistant chief of the Meadowview Volunteer\" Fire Department, said reports from witnesses in three separate residences indicated that the object appeared to explode somewhere in a triangular area having sides of about two miles and a base of one-half mile. An intensive search of a small grazing area near Meadow- view Sunday night and Monday afternoon failed to uncover anything unusual. However, a number of low-flying military jets were observed in the area on Monday, an unusual occur- rence. The Air Force denied having planes in the area. An FAA official speculated that the planes may have been con- ducting training exercises in connection with a military fa- cility 15 miles west of Emory.

Additional details are expected in time for the next.issue of Skylook from Ray Standord, who has taken some of the Project Starlight International detection equipment from Austin to the Clovis area. According to police dispat- cher Diana Kenemore, \"nearly everyone\" in Clovis called in UFO reports on Friday, Jan. 23. \"That many people can't be wrong,\" said Miss Kenemore. \"They all saw them at the same time. Plus our officers saw them. Every citizen that called was real willing to give his name, address, and phone num- ber.\" Police said that more than 30 silent, mysterious objects with pulsating lights were re- ported between nightfall and midnight. According to Miss Kenemore, several callers re- ported a group of 20 objects hovering over the Sandia Ele- mentary School in the north part of the city. Miss Kenemore said three frightened young boys reported seeing several flying objects land in a pasture near their home in the south part of Clo- vis. In Texico, a community of 1,000 persons on the Texas bor- der, Town Marshall Willie Ron- quillo said he followed up on a report and spotted a silent lighted object hovering about 900 feet above the town. He said it had green, yellow, and blue lights and made no sound. He said he notified state po- lice and gave chase when the object began moving northward. Several state police officers later reported seeing what was believed to be the same object. They said it was last seen mov- ing at a high rate of speed to- ward Tucumcari, NM.

Taken through a telescope with a 35mm camera on a tripod, the photo reportedly does not show all that was visible through the telescope. Says Price, \"Two black circular areas that appear vivid through the telescope don't show up in the photo due to the focusing problem.\" Whether this photo is of a UFO or a celestial body was not known as SKYLOOK went to press. (Submitted by Joe Brill) This photo, somewhat similar to the one taken in Clovis, NM, was shot near Elsthorpe, New Zealand, on Jan. 14, 1969, by Michael Bennett. Both Bennett and his wife watched the object, described as \"a point of light but brighter than a star,\" make \"random patternsâ€”shifting its position, stopping for five or ten seconds, then moving into another spot.\" Mrs. Bennett, who watched the object while her husband looked for film, said two smaller objects followed the larger object. This photo, one of several, was taken with a 120 camera with a 180mm telephoto lens set at f/4.5 and a shutter speed of 1/4 second. The film had a speed of 100 ASA, and the camera was on a tripod.

The full text of his letter to MUFON Director Walt Andrus follows: Dear Walt, Thank you for the invitation to meet with you and Jim Mc- Campbell on 8 Feb. at your home. I am sure that it will be a vital and interesting meet- ing; , however I have chosen to decline your invitation. In considering the total situa- tion I have decided to withdraw from the UFO scene in general and this seems to be as natural a breaking point as I will find. Please accept my resignation from all present positions held within MUFON, effective as soon as you .find suitable replace- ments, hopefully within sixty days. Until that time please accept this letter as my proxy in . all matters requiring my vote. If you see fit, I re- quest to be added to the list of MUFON field investigators for the Houston area, so I may provide local data to the or- â€¢ganization should the occasion arise. I have chosen to make this an open letter so that critics of the UFO organizations cannot generate rumors or fables about my resignation. In the follow- ing paragraphs I will list (briefly) .some of the things that helped to formulate my de- cision. The order of the items listed is unimportant and ir- relevant. At this point I want the world of Ufology to know, Walt and Jeanne, that there is. no breakdown in our friendship. I feel a warm glow of kinship since we have worked the UFO field together since the mid- 1960s. I am proud of the fine organization you have generated in MUFON and even more proud to have been permited to serve as deputy director. These past times I will cherish through the rest of my career, where ever it leads. As anyone can plainly see, MUFON is loaded with all types of good talent, both profes- sional and non-professional. Critics may take pot \"shots at various individuals from time to time; but these are just good people trying to do the best job they can. I know MUFON is here to stay, since it has taken the lead from the old leaders. The mixture of fresh talent and seasoned Ufologist makes an unbeatable team. I hope the result will be real progress. Now for some of the items that grouped together cause me to withdraw from 'the active UFO scene. 1. First of all I am under no pressure to get out. It is no government plot, MUFON pres- sure, employment pressure, nor family pressure. The first -three groups could care less whether I am in or out and my family would just as soon see me stay in.- 2. No individual has caused me to bail out. I have met some of the finest people I could ever hope to know, all within the various UFO organizations. These people are generally nice, friendly, generous, open minded, and talented. 3. The accumulation of things leading to my decision was cul- minated by the forthcoming CUFOS sympsoium in April. .When I received the invitation to attend I was quite thrilled. I thought it would be an oppor- tunity once and for all to really get an interchange of technical information flowing. As you know I have longed for such an interchange for years. I have been disheartened by the total lack of anything worth- while coming out of GUFOS (and .many share -that view), so I thought maybe something was fi- nally going to come out. And Walt I thought you had influ- enced the addition of my name to the invitation list, since you have been very close to Dr. Hynek for the past couple of years. When you called, ob- viously dismayed because you weren't aware many MUFON people had been invited, I felt as if I had shirked a duty by not making sure you were informed. 4. When I received the Dec- ember SKYLOOK a few days ago I was surprised to find out that Dr. Hynek is the featured speaker for the June MUFON sym- posium. Needless to say I found that to be a curious turn know- ing of your dismay with the \"secret\" CUFOS meeting and the CUFOS opinion that UFO symposi- ums are \"unprofessional.\" 5. I have been frustrated by the lack of useful, factual, technical information available to the individual investigator and researcher. I do know that such information exists, beyond the shadow of a doubt. How- ever, it is carefully protected by everyone so that it doesn't get diluted or used. This is not a MUFON criticism, but a general criticism. The \"it is for me to know and for you to find out\" attitude prevails all over the world. It is like UFOs are supposed to be someone's property. The only way the UFO problem will be solved is through teamwork, not through division. 6. I am tired of hearing how many IFO's have been found. It seems to be a form of apology for Ufologists (in every organ- ization) to dwell on the IFOs they have come across. It is like saying \"I am really OK be- cause I told someone they saw a star in. an unusual condition,\" not \"I am OK because I worked 700 hours on a case and it IS a UFO - and -remains unidentifi- able.\" The organization names are CUFOS not CIFOS, MUFON not MIFON., etc. People should quit apologizing for their involve- ment. It IS an honorable ef- 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"fort. 7. I have seen numerous cases put down through poor field analysis and/or arm-chair analysis. Again it seems to stem from the desire on the part of the \"expert\" to give an answer, and a well meaning de- sire at that. The T. Blann news release of the Clovis, N.M., sightings last week is a prime example. Sure the twinkles in the sky had a natural explana- tion, but what about the bank president's sighting of the brown cigar shaped object? Was it the result of a temperature inversion? Hardly!!!! 8. The other extreme is just as bad. When landmark cases are reported they should be opened up and investigated and dis- cussed without excuse or prej- udice. Protect the witness-- yes. But cover up the data-- no! I have been looking back over my notes of the years and have found more than a hundred cases, any one of which could have provided useful informa- tion had it been released. These involve airplane crashes, daylight disc sightings, mili- tary installation sightings, etc. After a while it makes one feel foolish trying to ex- pose future technology using only the lights in the sky cases, while hard data exists, but is \"not available.\" 9. The recent Arkansas event exhibited a certain infatuation for P. Klass by many of the hierarchy present. I found that hard to believe. Of course a devil's advocate is good for TV debates and game shows. It might even be good for science if it is responsible. P. Klass's effort cannot be con- strued as responsible, when it ignores facts, selects only data that fits a personal theory, and results in shouting down the opponent or at best dropping to the level of char- acter assassination. He says that when he gets two different stories on a case he throws out everthing related. Well, he wrote two books that conflict in explanations-so by his own criteria all his effort should be ignored.

This sighting was one of several in the Northern California area of Gilroy, San Jose, and Stockton. More recent sightings are currently under investigation. Maj.

However, I do not want to go on being teased by the drabs of information that flows from a- round the core of hard data that does exist. The total volume of information in Blue Book, the various intelligence organizations, and the private groups is staggering. If one could use it now we could ex- pect a quantum jump in the state of technology. Unfortun- ately, it is unavailable. In conclusion, my interest will remain.

Says Long: \"Through field glasses I could make out a definite form. The object appeared disc-shaped, like a flying saucer, and its body was radiating an intense orange glow.\" As Maj. Riddle maneuvered his aircraft to keep the object in sight, it drifted over the airport for perhaps five min- utes. \"I wasn't really inter- ested in getting too close,\" said Riddle. \"It scared me.\" He said the object suddenly turned bright red \"and blasted off. I can't estimate its speed. It was faster than any- thing I've ever seen. I've ob- served enough rocket launchings to know we have nothing that can compare to the speed of this thing.\" Maj. Riddle said that \"sec- onds before it shot out of sight, a gray mist formed a- round it. This was followed by a blast of green exhaust which penetrated the cloud like you'd put your finger through a smoke ring.\" Another air controller, John- Paul Ammirata, said he watched through binoculars as the ob- ject departed. \"In five or six seconds the UFO went up to 60,000 feet and completely fad- ed from view.\""},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Six Australian groups hold diversified UFO conference By Richard Hall International Coordinator A wide-ranging UFO Confer- ence, with 22 participants and representation by six ; UFO groups, was held Oct. 4-5, 1975, .at Terrigal, N.S.W. A copy of the Proceedings has been received from Keith Bas- terfield, Adelaide, S. Austral- ia. In many respects, the con- ference paralleled the October UFO Conference in Ft. Smith, AR, demonstrating a new mood in UFOlogy in recognizing the need for closer cooperation among UFO groups and a concerted ef- fort to study UFOs scientific- ally. Conference Chairman Keith Basterfield noted that, in the past, personality clashes and sheer distance have prevented closer cooperation among AUST tralian groups. He invited a representative of the Depart- ment of Defense to participate in the conference, .but the in- vitation was declined. Participants reviewed the activities of their groups (whose memberships range from about 14 to about 300) and focused on specific areas of needed research.

The Australian Co-Ordination Section (ACOS) for the U.S. Center for UFO Studies was rep- resented by Harry Griesberg, who stressed that it was not ACOS' intention to try to form a \"super group\" for all Aus- tralia. ACOS was formed in November, 1974, at the-request of Dr. J.A. Hynek, and serves as liaison between the Austral- ian groups and Dr. Hynek's Center. Dr. Geoff Stevens discussed analysis of physical samples associated with UFO sightings, and Dr. Herbison Evans talked about the use of diffraction gratings' and polaroid materials to obtain spectra of light from UFOs. Techniques of research, data gathering, UFO detectors, and the attitudes of scientists were other topics of discus- sion. The uses of computers and problems of information ex- changes also were explored. The possibilities of estab- lishing one high quality UFO magazine for Australia and a common report form for all groups were discussed, and will be the subj ect of continuing examination. It was unanimous- ly decided that a UFOCON (UFO Conference) 2 would be held in 1976 at Mt. Gambier, South Aus- tralia. The Conference Proceedings note, in summary: \"It was thought that we should continue to present the subject as a serious one which demands the attention of science. We should not make bold statements as to such things as the nature, or- igin or purpose of UFOs, merely to state that a phenomenon ex- ists which cannot at this stage be explained.\" BUFORA conducts UFO conference By Richard Hall International Coordinator A scientific UFO conference preceding those held in Ft. Smith, AR, and New South Wales, Australia, during October, 1975, is reported by the BUFORA Journal, July-August 1975 (Bri- tish UFO Research Association). On May 10 and 11, 1975, BUFORA held a National Research and Investigations Conference at Hanley. As in the other con- ferences, discussion focused on methodology and investigation techniques. Speakers were Professor John Taylor of King's College, .Uni- versity of London, noted for his researches into Uri Gel- ler's claims; Leonard Cramp, aeronautical enginner and a BU- FORA vice-president; Dr. Joa- chim P. Kuettner, chairman of the AIAA UFO Subcommittee, now associated with the World Meteorology Organization in Geneva; C.A.E. 0'Brian, geolo- gist and Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society; and Trevor Whitaker, opthalmologist and founder member of BUFORA's Yorkshire Branch.

By Mark R. Herbstritt Aspectâ€”position of a planet relative to another planet. As seen from the Earth. Celestial body--a body ex- ternal to the Earth which can be detected without visual aids, in the sky. Example: The sun, moon, and planets, stars, etc. Celestial sphereâ€”the sphere which is above the horizon and on which the visible sky ap- pears. Conjunctionâ€”the alignment of two bodies at their least distance of separation in the sky. Example: Mercury one de- gree from the Sun. Constellation--large groups of stars that have an imagin- ary resemblance to objects and animals on Earth. Magnitude--the visual bright- ness of a celestial body or star. Example: Venus magni- tude at greatest brilliancy is -4.4. The star Sirius has a magnitude of -1.4; therefore, Venus is 3 magnitudes or about 16 times more brilliant than Sirius, the brightest star. Meridian--a great circle passing through the north and south poles.. When a planet is on the Meridian at midnight it is in opposition to the sun or 180 degrees from the sun. Transitâ€”when a celestial body crosses the meridian. Opposition--particular posi- tion of two celestial bodies when they are diametrically op- posed to each other. A planet is in opposition when it is 180 degrees from the sun. It then rises at sunset and sets at sunrise and is on the merid- ian at midnight. Elongation--the inferior planets Mercury and Venus are never more than a certain angu- lar distance from the sun. The value is about 30 degrees for Mercury and 45 degrees for Venus. When an inferior planet such as Venus is in eastern elongation it is east of the Sun and sets after sunset. At western elongation it is west of the Sun and rises before sunrise. Some meteorological and as- tronomical phenomena may be mistaken for UFOs: Meteor Shower--the result of a shower of shooting stars (meteors) produced by those meteors of the swarm that enter the atmosphere. These showers occur at certain times of the year when the Earth encounters large numbers of meteors all moving together along the same orbit. Example: Perseid meteor shower--maximum August 12. An observer might see about 50 meteors per hour on this date after midnight. Radiantâ€”the constellation Perseus. Fireballâ€”a meteor brighter than the brightest planets: Venus, Jupiter etc. Meteorâ€”bodies composed most- ly of iron and nickel which are brought to incandescence by disintegrating when entering the Earth's atmosphere. Meteors are usually visible for only 2 or 3 seconds. Meteoriteâ€”a meteor that reaches the surface of the Earth. Ball lightningâ€”is a ball- shaped luminous electrical dis- charge which occurs during or near the end of a thunderstorm. Lightning balls vary in size from tiny beads to globes sev- eral feet in diameter. The commonest color is red or red- dish orange sometimes surround- ed by a blue haze. A hissing or humming sound generally ac- companies lightning balls. The smell is often described as \"sulphurous\" and is presumably due to ozone. They are usually visible from 3 to 5 seconds but have been seen up to 15 minutes stronomy Notes By Mark R. Herbstritt March sky Mercury--is too close to the Sun for observation this month. Venus--It rises about an hour before the Sun and is only 9 degrees above the south-eastern horizon at sunrise. Marsâ€”moving from Taurus into Gemini it is near the mer- idian at sunset and sets about 3 a.m. Jupiter--moving from Pisces into Aries, it is in the west at sunset and sets within 3 hours. Saturnâ€”near the boundary between Cancer and Gemini, it is high in the eastern sky at sunset. duration. I recommend the following books and magazines for more information on astronomy: (1) THE TAMING OF THE THUN- DERBOLTS --by C. Maxwell Cade. This book gives details of ball lightning reports and describes the differences between UFO's and ball lightning. (2) SPACE NOMADS--By Lincoln La Paz. This book tells of meteorite falls, craters caused by meteor impact, the nature of meteors, meteor showers, etc. (3) ASTRONOMY MAGAZINE--Mil- waukee, Wisconsin. This maga- zine is one of the best in the field of astronomy. Gives de- tails every month of positions of the planets, star maps, beautiful color photographs of nebula, galaxies, clusters, etc. News clips appreciated While we do not always ac- knowledge newspaper clips sent in, we do appreciate them and find them very helpful.

Investigations of the Novem- ber, 1975, Arizona abduction case appear to be shaping up as a prime example of how NOT to go about UFO investigation, and of how a lack of coordination confuses the issue, pitting one UFO group against another. In the process, potentially im- portant cases such as this are beclouded instead of clarified. It would seem that character information about Travis Walton and his co-workers, developed by trained investigators and/or behavioral scientists, is the only way to unravel this story. 1975 MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS (111 pages) \"An Expanded Vision of UFO Re- search\" by Dr. David M.

It is probably wishful think- ing, but wouldn't it be nice if in major landing, physical ef- fect, and occupant cases the major UFO groups would compare notes by telephone and decide on one of two courses of action to coordinate the investiga- tion: (1) If only one of the groups had an appropriately trained investigator or team within 50 miles of the site, the others would bow out, and the investigating group would share all of its findings with the cooperating groups; (2) If more than one group had appropriately trained in- vestigators close to the scene, each group would appoint one or two representatives to a joint team of investigators who would then pool all resources and in- formation. Cooperation on sky object The problem seems to lie in field investigations, primar- ily. The intergroup coopera- tion in analyzing the January, 1975, metal artifact is laud- able. In that case, personnel associated with NICAP, MUFON, and CUFQS participated in var- ious aspects of the investiga- tion and analysis work. Similar cooperation is great- ly to be desired in such addi- tional areas as photo-analysis and physical trace cases, An intergroup liaison committee of physical scientists and other analysts, those who have the necessary skills and the access to laboratory equipment, might be a workable solution. A UFO Physical Evidence Anal- ysis Group, to which all major UFO groups would agree to en- trust such cases, could be a strong unifying force. It also could command the respect of the news media and other opin- ion makers. Canadian family reports object Ken Sheppard and his family of North Battleford in western Saskatchewan, Canada, report- edly observed, through binocu- lars, a strange object about 5:30 a.m. on Nov. 18, 1975. He said the object was about 40 feet wide and had a large beam of light shining from tire cen- ter and three or four beamS coming from the sides. He said the object appeared flat and circular, and moved in a south- erly direction. (SOURCE: Sas- katoon STAR-PHOENIX, Nov. 19, 1975; submitted by Monka Swan- son.)
