In conjunction with the awareness theme, MUFON will host its 36 th annual International UFO Symposium in Den- ver, CO, on July 22-24. John Schuessler 2005 MUFON UFO Symposium It is time to start the registration pro- cess for attending the annual symposium at the Marriott Tech Center Hotel in Den- ver. A handy pull-out registration form is included in this issue of the Journal. To simplify the process, there will be two pre- registration packages this year. The \"Evidence Package\" will be for those attendees interested only in the speakers programs. The pre-registration price is $110. This is equivalent to $10 per speaker presentation. The \"New Technology Package\" in- cludes all of the speakers' presentations, plus two special events—a Friday night din- ner and program and a Saturday lunch and program. The pre-registration price is $155 and includes the meal costs. In addition, we are offering a bargain price of $65 per night, plus tax, on the rooms at the Marriott Tech Center. That is a savings of $35 per night as compared with room prices offered by other hotels in the area.

Sannazzaro Provided by A. J. Gevaerd MUFON National Director Brazil In August, 2004, a long interview by researcher Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues with Dr. Cesario L. Furtado was revealed. Dr. Furtado is one of the physicians who had attempted, without success, to heal the young policeman Marco Eli Chereze, who died less than a month af- ter having been in contact with one of the mysterious beings captured in Varginha in January, 1996. This interview was published in A.J. Gevaerd's magazine UFO Brazil of (No. 102), and on its web site http:// www.ufo.com.br. Since that interview was very long and contains repetitions, Gildas Bourdais pre- sents here a shorter version. It is preceded by a presentation of the Varginha case by A.J. Gevaerd. This new testimony comes in addition to that presented already in the French version of the book by Dr. Roger Leir, published in France in January, 2005, (be- fore the American edition) under the title Extraterrestrials Captured in Varginha, Brazil. The New Roswell. One of the most remarkable testimo- nies in that book, also quite new, is that of a doctor who had been commended by the military to perform an urgent sur- gery on one of the captured beings. (See August, 2004, MUFON UFO Journal) A most intriguing aspect, which renews the picture of the Varginha case, is that this surgeon reveals he had an intense tele- pathic communication with that being at the end of the surgery. He has also provided a precise descrip- tion of the being, whose extraterrestrial nature seems beyond doubt. I: Presentation by A.J. Gevaerd, One of the most serious facts of the \"Varginha case\" —and one of the most appafling—was the death on Feb. 15,1996, of Corporal Marco Eli Chereze, who was then aged 23. As we know, he was part of the secret service of the Military Police (P2) which participated in the capture of the second creature on the night of Jan. 20, 1996. Cpl. Marco Eli Chereze The news of his death spread very fast during the first months of the investiga- tions, which revealed that a policeman had died because of .a generalized infection after having been in contact with the ET. Faced with the gravity of the situation, the subject was treated with extreme cau- tion by the investigators concerned with the case, as the lawyer and consultant to the UFO review, Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues, discovered as he searched for information. Rodrigues checked with the City Hall and determined that a policeman had died shortly after the capture of the creatures. The ufologist even obtained a copy of the death record, by which he was able to locate the family of the boy. The same witness who alerted the in- vestigators about the death of Chereze also declared that the creature, at the moment of capture, had attempted a light resistence, obliging the policeman to touch the creature's left arm without his gloves. Some of his colleagues believed he would have been contaminated one way or another. The family of Marco Eli Chereze man- aged to have an inquiry opened by the local police precinct in order to establish eventual medical responsibilities for his death. At that time, searches seemed to be doomed to failure, but they continued in an effort to find the truth. The parents wanted to know how the young man died, because a few days after Jan. 20 a small tumor, similar to a furuncle, had appeared under one of the armpits of Chereze. Brief background A complete discussion of this case was presented by Bob Pratt and Cynthia Luce in the August and September, 1998, issues of the MUFON UFO Jour- nal. Additional information was in- cluded in the August, 2004, Journal. Briefly, the \"Varginha case\" in Bra- zil, involving the alleged capture of ETs, first came to light after three young women (then 14, 16, and 22 years of age) saw a strange creature as they were taking a shortcut through a vacant lot at about 3:30 PM on Jan. 20, 1996. Frightened, they reported the inci- dent, and ufologists initiated an inves- tigation. Later, as the investigation unfolded, it was reported that military police (the equivalent of state police in the U.S.) of Varginha case had captured a creature earlier in the day in woods three blocks away from the vacant lot. Then a witness told of seeing armed soldiers searching the same woods early that afternoon, hearing three shots be- ing fired, and then seeing two body bags (one squirming, one still) being loaded onto an army truck. There were additional reports of more creatures, unexplained carnage at the Varginha zoo, and the involvement of hospitals and firemen. There were rumors of an autopsy being performed on a creature. Then, late in 1996, a new witness came forward saying he had seen a UFO crash near Varginha early in Janu- ary. MARCH 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That tumor, according to what was learned at the time, would have been rap- idly extracted by the doctor in charge, at the very premises where he was serving. We know today that this did not hap- pen. But what most drew the attention of the boy's family was the lack of infor- mation about his health condition and, later, about his tragic death. Even months after his burial, nobody knew exactly the cause of his death. Autopsy closed The police superintendant himself, who led the inquiry, was not able to be present at the autopsy of the policeman, in spite of his insistance in the face of the police corps in which Chereze served. The retention and dissimulation of information regarding that subject were purely and simply an affront to the fam- ily of Chereze and to the laws of the na- tion. Even worse, such an affront was commited by the Military Police itself. It was one year after the event of Varginha, on Jan. 20, 1997, that things began to move, after the dissimulation of the facts had been denounced by ufologists and all the press. Among the most disquieting facts put forward by the investigators was the ab- sence of information regarding the death of Chereze, the most important piece of the headache named the Varginha Case. Thus, in the middle of a press meet- ing at the first anniversary of the event, investigators denounced the silence and obtained for the family, the police superintendant, and the press access to the autopsy file. From its contents, sol- dier Chereze died from a generalized in- fection. The policeman arrived home a certain night after the capture of the creature, suffering from a strong pain in the back. After the ablation of the tumor, he showed a gradual process of paralysis and fever which, becoming more serious, obliged him to go to the hospital Bom Pastor. He remained confined and practically isolated from his family during several days. Close relatives of the policeman, es- pecially his sister, Marta Antonia Tavares, the one who went most frequently to the hospital, could not have contact with him, and had great difficulty meeting the doc- tor responsible for the treatment. It was even more difficult for the fam- ily to discover what the illness was. Shortly after his entry at the hospital Bom Pas- tor, the policeman was transferred to the hospital Regional Do Sul de Minas, also located in Varginha. This is the same hospital where he would have brought, on the night of Jan. 20, the creature he had captured. Chereze was led directly to the center for inten- sive care and taken in charge by the very physician who reveals today publicly what he knows. This is where Chereze passed away at exactly 11-AM on Feb. 15, 26 days after his implication with the extraterrestrial. (Note by G. Bourdais: the following interview-of the doctor gives a slightly different story.) \"Although all the tests and'exams pos- sible were applied in the search of a diag- nosis, he could not be saved in time\" stated the superintendant in charge of the inquiry, in the course of his deposition before the judge of the \"COMARCA.\" It was just discovered that the physi- cians who took care of Chereze at the time did not have the faintest idea of how to fight the illness which was striking him down. After the death of the boy had been unveiled before the press, the commander of the Military Police of the state of Minas Merais denied the facts immedi- ately, including the presence of Chereze during that night of Jan. 20. But in order to protect such an absurd story, they invented an even more crude one. The family of Marco Eli Chereze con- firmed that he was indeed on duty that night. Furthermore, he was not the only one to die because of his professional activities involving contact with an alien, but the creature he had captured also died after that contact, and much faster than Chereze. \"It seems clear that the death of the policeman has become the less control- lable and the most dangerous piece of the process of dissimulation imposed by the military of ESA and the Brazilian Army,\" says Marco Petit, co-editor of the magazine UFO, who participated actively in the inquiry. A.J. Gevaerd then presents the inter- view of Dr. Cesario Lincoln Furtado by Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues, stressing the considerable research of Ubirajara on Varginha, and the \"extreme importance\" of this document. Here is now the inter- view. Dr Cesario LJnco/n Furtado II - What was the cause of the death of policeman marco Eli Chereze ? Interview of Dr Cesario Lincoln Furtado by Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues (summary by Gildas Bourdais). Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues (Ubirajara hereafter) asks Dr Cesario Lincoln Furtado (Dr Furtado hereafter) what his role was in the treatment of policeman Chereze in the hospitals of Varginha in 1996. The following is the summary of his answers to several questions, con- densed in chronological order: Dr. Furtado - Marco Eli Chereze was first admitted in the Department \"Prontomed\" (emergency ward) of the hospital Regional by my colleague, Armando Martins Pinto (cardiologist), on Feb. 12, 1996. He entered there because of an intense pain in the lumbar area. Dr. Armando directed him to the hospital Bom Pastor, where he was rapidly taken in charge by Dr. Rene, who was cardiolo- gist, general practitioner, and head of the Department of cardiology, and who or- dered some exams. I was then involved, being at the time the supervisor (sort of coordinator) of cardiology at Bom Pas- tor. Questioned by Ubirajara, Dr. Furtado explains that he worked in both hospi- tals. However, during that month of Janu- ary, he did not work at the hospital Re- gional. He went every morning to Bom Pastor. The reason why Chereze was sent to Bom Pastor is not clear to him: per- haps because of lack of room at the Re- MUFON UFO Journal MARCH 2005"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"gional, or rather because Chereze would have military medical coverage there. Dr. Furtado - The next day, at the hospital Bom Pastor, we asked for new exams because Chereze was still suffer- ing in the lumbar area. We asked for urine analyses, radios of the column, of the lumbar and sacrum areas, in addition to an examination by an orthopedist because the pain was intense and we suspected the presence of a herniated disc. Dr Rogerio Lemos, in charge of orthopedy, examined him and said that there was no alteration, and that the prob- lem did not come from there. He told us to continue our search of the cause of the pain, as fever began to appear. The blood analyses, which arrived in the afternoon, showed a hemogram with a leucocytosis, a deviation to the left and toxic granulations in the neutrophils. This was the sign of an important infection, highly capable of provoking a poisoning (toxemia)-because there were those toxic granulations. We then administered two antibiotics: penicillin and gentamicin, because we thought that there could be a pneumo- nia, owing to the localization of the pain, or a urinary infection. His case was evaluated again on Feb. 13: same condition. The next day, still at the hospital Bom Pastor, he spent the day with fever and pains, but at an \"accept- able level.\" Until the morning of the 15, where he woke-up very tired and in a state of torpor, with signs of cyanosis. These symptoms seemed to confirm a general poisoning vehiculated by the blood, with a possible outcome in septi- cemia. He was then immediately trans- ferred to the CTI (Intensive Care) of the hospital Regional, where he was put un- der medication. At the CTI of the hospital Regional, one of the first exams was for HFV, with a negative result. His state of health de- teriorated rapidly, and he died in a few hours, although he had been given anti- biotics soon after his admission. This intrigued everybody, and an au- topsy was performed. It did not confirm a urinary infection, but that was later con- firmed by the urine culture which had been ordered at the Bom Pastor. He also had a mild pneumonia. Said Dr. Furtado: \"In my opinion, die urinary infection was the cause of septi- cemia, because the pulmonary infection was so minimal that it could not have been responsible for such a state.\" The close relatives of Chereze, mainly his sister Antonia, says Dr. Furtadoo sus- pected that the abcess Chereze had in the left armpit, after the military operation, had not been properly treated, which may have caused infections. But Dr. Furtado denies that, because, when Chereze was admitted at the hospi- tal, the abcess was practically cured. Fur- thermore, the abcess was due to another bacteria, a staphylococcus, which is nor- mal for any small infection on the skin. The main point, insists Dr Furtado, is that the cause of his death—the causa mortis—has not been clarified. A few days before, the boy was in very good health, and at the beginning the infection looked relatively simple. He never had in the past any difficult treatment which could have caused an im- munodeficiency. And it could not be con- genital either, because if such had been the case, he would not have reached the age of 23 years in good health. This is why we can affirm that his im- munodeficiency was \"acquired,\" but we don't know how. His death was not caused by a pneumonia, neither by an urinary in- fection, nor by the abcess. Dr Furtado also says, \"At the begin- ning, the diagnosis of an urinary or kid- ney infection prevailed because of the presence of enterobacteria. But, in less that 20 days, three bacterias attacked the policeman. THREE ! This is a very rare thing in the world. 'When Marco had a pulmonary infec- tion, he already no longer had any im- mune defense. In that case, any bacteria can take control of a person.\" At the request of Ubirajara, Dr. Furtado gives more medical details. Ubirajara asks: \"In the hemogram sent by the laboratory of Bom Pastor, it is said: 'Presence of cytoplasmic vacuoles. Pres- ence of 8% of thin toxic granules in the neutrophils. Discret polikilocytosis.' How can you, as a physician, interpret the pres- ence of 8% of those small toxic granula- tions in the neutrophils?\" Dr. Furtado - They appear in the neu- trophils of a person who is victim of the agression of a very virulent bacteria. This provokes a \"battlefield,\" if we may say, which could reach 50% or 60%. The file mentions.8% because it refers to the first blood analysis. And that already demon- strates that there is an infection, which led to the prescription of antibiotics. Their presence denotes an important and seri- ous infection. It is not frequent, except in serious cases. Ubirajara - in ufological circles, when some researchers will read this statement in the results of the hemogram, they are going to interpret that those 8% of toxic granulations were \"unknown things,\" the presence of a new substance, or yet some- thing else. Dr. Furtado - No, nothing like that, absolutely nothing. As I said already, they don't appear in other infections, but are frequent in serious infections. Ubirajara - During the time that you took care of the policeman, did you no- tice, at the Bom Pastor as well as the Re- gional, the presence of any unknown phy- sician, from outside ? Dr. Furtado - No, I did not notice any. I did not see either the superiors of Marco Eli Chereze, whether of the police or the army. They did not look for me, not even to collect the least information regarding the boy, during the two or three days. Ubirajara - There is, in the medical inquiry following Marco's death, die depo- sition of a dermatologist. He mentions a blood infection, in which red cells would have been attacked by white cells. Accord- ing to this dermatologist, those 8% in the blood examination could have denoted a contagion by the skin of an eventual toxic substance which would have attacked the red cells. What do you think of that? Dr. Furtado - This has nothing to do with it. There is no connection between these elements.The report also says that a few days could have passed before the process materialized, but it is not so. If there were such a contagion by the skin, its effect would be blazing. We would be decimated every day that way. Ubirajara - Could you see the body? Dr. Furtado - No, I could not. It is not usual. After the death, the body is taken for the autopsy, and there is no other recourse. After a person is deceased, you inform the family-and in the case in ques- tion, I was not even the person who did that, because when they took him to the CTI, I transferred my responsabilities to the other doctor at the CTI. Ubirajara - Did the family think of asking for an exhumation of the body? Dr. Furtado - Not that I know of. In fact, an exhumation would not have brought any proof of what really caused the death. As for the death certificate, the cause of the death was not mentioned because there was not the faintest element permitting to guarantee anything. Ubirajara - You mentioned that a MARCH 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"member of his family had affirmed that he wanted to know what dris illness was about, because the policeman had partici- pated in the capture of something strange. Was this told to you before, or after, his death ? Dr. Furtado - A few days later, when his death was still recent. I don't remem- ber very well, but his sister was in great shock, and she came to talk with me. Ubirajara - Let's stick to the facts re- garding this interview. But, did you no- tice any other movement at the time, in one of these hospitals ? Dr. Furtado -1 heard of many things, but I did not witness any particular move- ment. However, rumors were thriving at the maternity ward of the hospital Re- gional, but I never worked there, being not an obstetrician. Furthermore, the maternity was somewhat separate, the entrance and the rest of it. As for the hospital Humanitas, where I also worked at the time, I did not notice anything. Not even comments between doctors, nurses, and office personnels. (Ubirajara asks further if there could be isolated areas in those hospitals. Dr. Furtado explains that, at the Regional, there was also a reserved aisle, used for contagious patients. At the Humanitas, there were few movements, and there were many rooms without activity. But, in 1996, there were no longer isolation premises, except in hospitals specializing in conta- gious illnesses.) Ubirajara - Do you see other interest- ing aspects to mention about that episode? Dr. Furtado - Listen, there is that story reported by the family (regarding the cap- ture of the being), about which I don't know anything. But we don't find any ra- tional explanation for the death of this boy. Because it was terribly fast, you un- derstand? Ubirajara - Could it be caused by a totally unknown bacteria, however im- probable ? Dr. Furtado - Yes. Well, if we talk of something completely unknown, it is ob- vious that we could not risk any conjec- tures. There is no answer possible. Now, could something have penetrated inside his organism, something equally un- known, which would have deprived him of his immunity system? This is another question without answer. Ubirajara - Could you tell what type of thing would be susceptible to provoke that, for instance? Dr. Furtado - I don't know. That might be an injectable \"poison,\" an in- fection of injured skin, at the face or foot. It might be an injury caused by a nail, which would provoke tetanus, etc. But we know tetanus. A multitude of things, I might say, and this is just to enumerate some examples of what might have con- taminated that boy and deprived him of immune resistance. I repeat that I say that it \"COULD BE.\" Ubirajara -Are you telling me that the death of Marco Eli Chereze was a strange death? Dr. Furtado - A strange death, with- out rational explanation. In the course of my professional life, I have seen already two persons, aged about 25, die of an infection, but we knew that both had im- mune deficiency. Both of them, if I recall well, had had removal of the spleen (splenectomy) fol- lowing a past accident. After a certain delay, that causes immunodeficiency. In that situation, the person may decease rapidly if he finds himself in the condi- tion of a septicemia. But, once again, it was not the case. —Thanks to translator C.

NC couple report high-flying UFO On June 22, 2004, a 47-year-old col- lege graduate and his 40-year-old wife were on the deck of their home in Mecklenburg, NC, at 6:10 PM when he noticed a flying object which appeared to be at a \"very high altitude.\" He watched it until it stopped, then went inside and got his binoculars, which he shared with his wife. Through the binoculars the object ap- peared to be moving \"in a tight geometri- cal pattern,\" and had a distinct shape. It appeared to be dull gray in color. After about five minutes the object dis- appeared behind thunder clouds moving in from the west. —Investigated by George E. Lund III, SD NC.

As the technology develops, we have the chance to put this reality on scientific foundations, such as photographs, video footage, computer analysis and other data received from case studies. Just like the rest of the world, UFO sightings, ET encounters, and abductions take place in Tur- key. However, be- ing a young \"re- public,\" the his- Esen Sekerkarar tory of the sightings and the UFO investigations dif- fer from the ones in the US. UFO Organizations in Turkey Actually, the major difference is not mainly about the organizations, but with the history of the UFO subject in our countries. I would like to remind here that even though my country has a 700-year his- tory as the Ottoman Empire, the history of the new, modern Republic of Turkey is quite young, as it was established in 1923. When our leader Atatiirk ended the empire, he also made various reforms, one of which was the changing of the alpha- bet. Until the establishment of the Turk- ish Republic in 1923, the Arabic alpha- bet was being used. But with a reform in 1928, a new Turkish alphabet was ac- cepted nationally, with new letters, mostly taken from the Latin alphabet. Today, we can't read or write in old Turkish, and would not understand it even if it was written with the new letters. We are completely alien to it, and it is almost impossible to access UFO reports or any related documents that were recorded dur- ing the Ottoman period. Therefore, the history of the UFO sub- ject in Turkey is only as old as the repub- lic-which is 81 years. The first centre for collecting and re- MARCH 2005 searching ufological data throughout Tur- key, Sirius, is the place where I served as vice-president, and it was founded only in 1998. Before then, UFOs and aliens were (and still are) mainly the subject of paranormal and/or new age groups. In the US, I observe that there is mostly a strict separation between UFO organi- zations and new age organizations. Most of the UFO groups in your country re- ject new age subjects, and some new age groups do not think there are such things like UFOs. In my country, most of the people who are aware of the UFO fact are familiar with new age subjects—and vice versa. Even Turkey's first UFO Research Cen- tre Sirius has gradually become more new age oriented as they started to run a new age magazine including UFO subjects. They still conduct research on UFO cases, though. Another difference is that there aren't as many researchers in Turkey as you have in the US. When there is no variety, there is no versatility; for example, scientists do not become a member of such organiza- tions here (the number of these organi- zations here is only two, and one of them concentrates only on debunking every single UFO incident). Publications are also poor, because there isn't much-awareness and interest. Therefore, the difference between our countries is huge. I also regret to say that public interest in the phenomenon is go- ing down—and down rapidly. People seem to have lost their faith in the truthfulness of some researchers. They are also more engaged with making their livings under unstable economic cir- cumstances, which makes them see the ET phenomenon as a \"light\" issue. Most striking incidents Here I would like to present the most striking incidents that have taken place in Turkey. I have chosen the cases that also made the papers, which is not something you can see here every day. Prime Minister's observation On Jan. 26, 1983, Turgut Ozal, Turkey's 19 th prime minister, who then be- came the 8 th President of the country in 1989, made a UFO observation himself MUFON UFO JOURNAL together with his wife and other officials. He was in Ankara, at the Esenboga Air- port, and his destination was Istanbul. According to the general director of the airport, one luminous object appeared in the sky at about 6 PM. The governor's assistant stated that the object was first noticed and reported to the tower by a British Airways pilot. Then all planes landing and taking off reported the same object to the control tower and asked what it was. This object emitted colorful lights, and was observed by the prime minister with great aston- ishment as it could be seen in a picture taken by a journalist. He then joked to the reporters, saying, \"Lucky you. Now you have a good head- line!\" He didn't comment further. Later, two air force jets took off to examine the object, but the luminous ob- ject went so far that the jets weren't able to come near it. UFOs over the capital's airport The prime minister's observation was not the only UFO case at our airports. On Feb. 2, 1989, at about 10 PM local time, 10 flying objects were observed over Ankara, Esenboga airport. These objects were emitting yellow, red, and green lights. They could be observed with the naked eye and were also detected by the airport radars. One of the objects came down so low on the #2 runway of the airport that people thought it was going to land. An F-16 and a fleet of F-4 Phantoms chased the objects. Mustafa Ozatamer, general director of the state airfields, was sent to the airport by order of the minister of communica- tions, and stayed there to watch until the morning. While the control official watched the objects, he is said to shout, \"I see them... I see the UFOs. There, they're moving.\" Businessmen's sighting Now a very interesting case. What makes it interesting is not only the size of the alleged UFO, which was said to had been kilometers in diameter; but also that all witnesses are Turkey's well-known businessmen! On Sept. 17, 1985, a group of busi- nessmen were sailing in their yachts on"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the Bosphorus in Istanbul. According to the witnesses' testimony, at 3:30 AM they saw a huge set of lights approaching them. It hovered over them, and everywhere was like daylight (see drawing at right). They said that the object was emitting a great deal of heat. The yachtsmen tried to talk to each other on the radio, but even though they tried 16 different channels, the radios just wouldn't work. The whole incident lasted about five minutes, then the object flew away. They said that even after it went away, the heat remained for awhile. The observers were all shocked and frightened. When their radios started to work again they contacted the coast guard radio, and learned that the coast guard also saw the same thing. But it could never be identi- fied. Summer of 1999 There have always been UFO incidents in Turkey, but there has been a sudden and a tremendous increase in the sightings since the huge earthquake we had in Au- gust, 1999, when 17 thousand people died. Before the earthquake, we were receiv- ing 15-20 calls every day at our Centre—at that time I was working at Sirius UFO Space Sciences. That was a very high num- ber of calls to receive in a day. What was more surprising was that they were com- ing from the same areas. Then the quake hit, and what we saw was that the places where the calls came from were die places where the quake hit the worst! UFOs were seen by masses of people even after the quake, and were re- corded and broadcast on many national TV channels. As you might know, sometimes UFO sightings increase before and after natu- ral disasters. What could be the reason for that? There is not a certain answer, but what I believe is this: If you were to examine a planet and gain more information about it and its nature, wouldn't you pay more attention to it when it was at its extreme points, such as volcano eruptions, earth- quakes, and other natural disasters? So such an increase in UFO sightings before and after these kinds of events might be that ETs monitor us intensely during such occasions to collect more in- formation. Most of those sightings took place at night time. And many people said they were not UFOs, but earthquake lights. UFO over yachts. However, earthquake lights last a few sec- onds. They don't hover in the sky, emit colorful lights, and move in different di- rections for minutes. Even the head of the National Earthquake Committee, Prof. Ahmet Mete Isikara, made a state- ment about this on a national TV chan- nel, and said these objects were not earth- quake lights. He said he had no answer to what they were! Esme alien encounter This is a unique case that took place in June, 2001, in the Esme village of the town Usak. This is the Aegean region of Turkey, which is the western part of the country. Three villagers, Fevzi Can, his wife Selma Can, and their friend Ayse Topaloglu, left in the morning to hoe their tobacco field. They got on Mr.Can's trac- tor, heading for their farm. But on the way, at about 7 AM, they saw a strange being which was about 15 meters away in a field. When Mr. Can saw it moving towards them, he stopped the tractor. Right at that time, the being started to go the opposite way. As the two women stayed on the tractor, Mr.Can got off to chase this thing. He could approach it as close as 2 meters. The creature started to rise in the air, ascending as high as a tree. Then it stopped and hovered at that height. After staring at it for 3-4 seconds, Mr. Can thought of dropping the creature down with a stone, because he wanted to exam- ine this thing closer to understand what it was. Mr. Can says as soon as he had this thought of throwing a stone at this thing, the creature started to rise higher in the air. It was like it could understand what he was thinking. The man threw about 4- 5 stones, but all missed. Then the crea- ture headed the opposite direction, flying away from the villagers, but still facing them. The witnesses say that the creature was not a tall one. It was about 60-70 cm. in height. It seemed to be wearing what the villagers describe as a \"gelatin-like\" thin suit. They could recognize the creases on it. The wife of Mr. Can, who is one of the witnesses, says that it looked as if the suit the creature was wearing hadn't been ironed! On the top of his head, the being had a red light. Its eyes were black in color and oval-shaped. The witnesses say that its eyes looked as if they were \"attached on the suit\" or \"drawn on the suit.\" So, they were not real eyes. The being had no arms, and the legs looked as if they were stuck together. Its feet appeared to be rectangular in shape, and red in color. Also an orange-red color was shining from its abdomen. Witnesses don't know if there was any- thing at the back part of the creature, because it never turned its back. Not even when it was flying away. But it made no sound. It was completely silent. It didn't MUFON UFO Journal MARCH 2005"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"look like a living thing, but a kind of a robot. The governor, Ayhan Cevik, and the town councilor, Mehmet Yildirim, say that they know the witnesses very well, and they are reliable and honest people who wouldn't make up such a story. I also met these people myself, and found them very sincere and reliable. Actually they were extremely disturbed and uncomfortable about the attention they received for weeks from the media. Some of the TV channels brought them to Istanbul and had them as guests on their programs. Mr. Can was complaining that he could not get down to his work on his farm because of the intense attention. He was also deeply sorry and regretful to have thrown stones at the creature. All of the witnesses thought that this encounter was kind of a gift, a favor from Allah to them. Even though we had no doubts of the truthfulness of the witnesses, we asked them if they would take a lie detector test, and they immediately accepted it. We asked the Security Headquarters in Istanbul to provide us with a lie-detector. They said we should write a petition to the Ministry of Defence. We did that, and this time the MoD said we should contact the Ministry of Interior Affairs. We talked to them on the phone, and they said they had a lie detector, but an offi- cial petition should be sent to them. We sent the petition, but our request was rejected, saying they had no lie de- tectors, which is not true! Obviously they were disturbed by this idea because the villagers would pass the test. I believe the being was some sort of a remote controlled robotic-type creature. I have no clues as to the purpose it had there, but one interesting thing is that Esme has large gold and uranium re- serves. So, could it be for the gold, or the uranium, or both? I don't know. A day after this incident, the same be- ing was seen by two guards of a factory in Foca, which is not very far from Esme. The guards were so frightened that they ran inside and told their manager about the strange thing outside. When they all went out, the being had already left. Head of the Department of Religious Affairs speaks As this news was all over papers and TV channels every day for about two- weeks time, the head of the Department of Religious Affairs at the time, Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, had to make a press release saying: \"There are creatures not only in this world, but also in the space and the worlds beyond space. According to Islamic be- liefs, there are more than 18 thousand 'alems.' There are genies, angels, and other creatures other than humans. UFOs [aliens] are in this category.\" Well, it is very curious that the Kuran says that in the universe there are more than 18 thousand 'alems,' which means \"class of beings, realm.\" For example, one type of alem is hu- mans. The other is animals. Others —from the Islamic point of view-are plants, ge- nies, spirits and angels, which makes six alems so far. Let's also add ETs to that. Wonder what the rest would be! Next month, Part 2. Pennsylvania had busy 2004 By Stan Gordon paufo@westol.com Pennsylvania has historically been an active area of the United States where UFO sightings are constantly reported. Residents of the Keystone State have also reported many encounters with strange creatures, with hundreds of Bigfoot encoun- ters reported from many loca- tions in the state. The Chestnut Ridge, which runs from Preston County, W. VA. through Stan Gordon Westmoreland, Fayette, and Indiana coun- ties in Pennsylvania, has been an area where frequent observations of giant hair- covered man-like creatures have been re- ported. Among the other strange creatures re- ported in the Pennsylvania woods and countryside have been sightings of moun- tain lions (which have been declared offi- cially extinct in this part of the country for many years), black panthers, and Thunderbirds (giant birds with huge wing- spans.) When I began to take calls from the public in 1969 concerning UFO sightings, little did I realize how many other strange things were reportedly going on as well. Those people calling in were reporting ev- erything from supposed haunted houses to close-range UFO observations. It was in 1970, that I founded and di- rected the first of three volunteer research groups that investigated these matters over many years. Since 1993,1 have con- tinued to document current reports and investigate cases as time permits as an independent researcher. Yearly sighting reports from across the state continue to be reported on my PA UFO Hotline, or via e-mail. I also main- tain contact with many researchers and organizations who also are interested in these reports. The National UFO Report- ing Center (NUFORC) in Seattle, WA, also receives some Pennsylvania UFO re- ports as well. It's been 45 years since I began to keep track of such oddities, and I still haven't seen a UFO, nor have I had a first hand Bigfoot observation. Over the years I have been involved in the investigation of thousands of strange incidents reported from throughout Penn- sylvania. From the time that I began to conduct firsthand investigations into these matters, I soon realized that many of the strange incidents reported could indeed be explained. Many UFO sightings, some creature sightings, and various other anomalous occurrences commonly had a natural or man-made origin. Some, cases however, are not so easily explained away. Pennsylvania residents from 48 coun- ties in the commonwealth reported many unusual incidents during 2004. UFO sightings, Bigfoot encounters and other creature reports, strange footprints, mys- terious booms, and odd ground markings were some of the anomalies reported. Some of the UFO sightings were de- termined to be misidentifications of the Planet Venus, bright meteors, and re-en- try of space debris. Some examples of the incidents re- ported from Pennsylvania during 2004 include: Bigfoot sightings I received reports of some possible Bigfoot sightings from several locations in Westmoreland County. The Pennsyl- vania Bigfoot Society (PBS), which also investigates PA Bigfoot activity, received MARCH 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"reports of Bigfoot activity from various areas of the state including Armstrong, Beaver, Carbon, and Fayette County. In January, 2004, in a mountainous area of Somerset County, a frightened motor- ist reported seeing a tall dark hair-cov- ered man-like creature walk up from a creek bed, then move over an embank- ment. The PBS investigated some Bigfoot reports which reportedly occurred from August through October in Beaver County, located north of Pittsburgh. One sighting involved a man who said he saw a hair-covered man-like creature running through the woods near his home. Another incident involved a lady who claimed that she saw three such creatures moving through a field. Researcher Joe Nemanich provided me details of a Bigfoot sighting he investi- gated which occurred in Tioga County on July 20, 2004. This sighting, which oc- curred in daylight, was observed by a man working at a construction site. The witness observed a dark, hair-cov- ered man-like creature which he estimated to be 7 to 8 feet tall standing near a road in this very rural area. The man watched in amazement as the creature took three long steps and crossed the road. The creature continued to venture into a swamp area. The ground cover along the path which the creature had traveled was found to have been smashed down. For more information on PA Bigfoot sightings, go to my web site: www.stangordon.com or the PBS web site: www.pabigfootsociety.com . Unidentified objects In March, in a rural area of Westmoreland'County, passengers in a vehicle came around a bend and the ve- hicle headlights struck an object that was sitting on the roadway ahead. The object appeared to be a small metallic cigar- shaped device. As the people watched, the object rose straight up from the ground while illumi- nated by the headlights, then moved to- wards the right and continued off in the distance. Researcher Jim Brown investigated a UFO sighting which occurred on April 4, 2004, near California, PA. A man ob- served a large triangular object in the sky above a nearby home. The object, which appeared to glow, also had a blue light at each corner. While the witness continued to watch the triangular object, another strange ob- 10 ject also appeared in the sky which looked like a glass rod. While both objects were in the sky, a strange sparkling material began to fall from the sky towards the ground. The first object moved off quickly to- wards the north. The other object had also left the area. Near Punxsutawney, PA, in early June, a woman was gazing out her window dur- ing the evening when she observed a square-shaped object that looked as if it was made up of multitudes of light bubbles. When it was first seen, the object was about 30 feet above the ground, and only about 50 feet away from the window. The witness observed the object for awhile, and watched as it began to rise slowly up- wards into the sky. As the object gained in altitude, it soon looked just like a light off in the distance. On the night of June 26, 2004, at ap- proximately 10:50 PM, there were reports from witnesses in the Pittsburgh area, as well as around Greensburg, reporting the sighting of a bright orangish-red object with a long fiery trail moving rapidly across the sky. The NUFORC also received many re- ports from Lancaster to Tionesta in Penn- sylvania. The NUFORC also received nu- merous reports from other states of what was probably the same object. What was observed was a re-entry of Russian space debris. To report a UFO or Bigfoot sighting, or other strange occurrences in Pennsyl- vania, contact Stan Gordon.

Man enveloped in beam of light Event: light beam Date: 10 PM, July 12, 2004 Location: Circleville, OH Investigator: Pete Hartinger, Director, Roundtown UFO Society On Monday, July 12, 2004,1 received the call from the witness, and got to his home within 20 minutes, about 30 min- utes after the sighting. The witness, who was still excited, showed me the area where the sighting occurred. He had been grilling in his backyard after returning late from a little league baseball game. It was dark in his back- yard, and the only light he had was from his grill before the sighting. Although the witness said we could use his name (on file with MUFON), I think we should withhold it for now. On the MUFON sighting form the witness wrote: \"I was grilling in my backyard at or around 10 PM EST, and was on the phone with my mother. I saw a light before me, and it was focused on myself and the grill. I turned to yell at my son because I thought he had a flashlight on me, but there was no one there. \"Out of the corner of my eye at about 300-500 feet above me was an oval- shaped craft with a blue and white col- ored light fixed on myself. I thought it was a UFO. \"I told my mother what I was looking at. I thought I was in a dream, but when I started to explain to my mother what it MUFON UFO Journal was doing, the light went out, and it moved at an upward angle and was out of sight in a second or two.\" On the form, he described the object as being grayish colored. There was no sound or smell to it. He did not experi- ence any physical disturbances. He thought that it was three times the size of a full moon, and stated that it left a trail when it departed very fast. The sight- ing lasted about 30 seconds. He also did a crude sketch of the object hovering over him. The witness' wife, who was in the house at the time, stated that.the televi- sion flickered during that time period. Later in talking to him he brought up the idea of taking a lie detector test. I thought that was a positive. The next day, July 13, I checked with the Circleville Police Department and the local Pickaway County Sheriff's Office. Neither had any reported UFO sightings. I also checked in the local neighbor- hood with no results. I also phoned and talked to the witness' mother, asking her if she heard any unusual sound in the background while on the phone with her son. She had not. In checking with Peter Davenport's website I did notice that Portsmouth, OH, had a sighting that included 4 beams of lights coming down to the ground. This was just five nights later on July 17. Ports- mouth is just 64 miles south of Circleville. MARCH 2005"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Analysis indicates unknown object Woman photographs UFO from front porch Reported by: William I.

Explanatory Phenomenon Check: In viewing the photos the witness has provided, I think it is logical to rule out the misidentification of a conventional craft, a weather anomaly, such as a me- teor, which doesn't behave in the manner described, or a misinterpretation of a planet such as Venus. The nature of the witness' description indicates a solid ob- ject. Sighting Evaluation: CE1—unex- plained. MARCH 2005 Investigator's Analysis: The UFO photograph is shown at upper right. I asked the witness to take a couple of reference photos from the same position she photographed the UFO so that I could estimate angular image size and dis- tance. One of the pic- tures was taken in the regular (un- zoomed) mode, and showed the hill over which the UFO was photographed in the background, and a car in the foreground. The other photo was intended to show the same area in daylight where she had photographed the object at night with the 4x digital zoom. The witness provided the following additional information: \"It is our estimation that the object or light was 30 feet long in the vertical posi- tion. The distance from the porch [to the car] is 46 feet. \"The camera is an HP320. The Hewlett-Packard 320 has 2 IMP with 4x digital zoom. The photos were processed through the Polaroid Photo Max SE pro- gram. My computer is HP XT963.\" Photo Analysis: By measurements of the photos with a ruler it was verified that objects in the 4x zoom mode were twice the height or width of the same objects in the regular mode. To roughly calibrate the distance to the top of the hill over which the object was photographed, it was estimated that the trees on top of the hill were about 30 feet tall. Trigonometry gives a distance to the top of the hill of about 900 feet. The estimate that the UFO was 30 feet long in the vertical position, approxi- mately the same dimension as the esti- mated height of the trees, makes it rea- sonable that it was also about 900 feet MUFON UFO JOURNAL Above photo was taken by witness about 6 PM.

Examination of the picture indicates diat the ground beneath the trees was being illuminated by the UFO or was re- flecting light from the UFO. It also appears that a beam of light from the UFO slanting down toward the viewer's left was illuminating part of the trees. Overall, the impression is that the UFO was perhaps somewhat farther away than the trees, and the distance may have been 1,000 to 1,500 feet.

He writes: \"There is no detail within the object. The absence of detail indicates the CCD was saturated, as shown by blooming patterns around the light. (This means that it was a very bright light as the witness stated. This raises the question of whether the object emitted a reddish glow as the witness stated, or if she noted this later on the photograph.- WIM] \"It is possible to overlay the daylight shots with the night shots, as seen in the attached. [The photographer's] position was off perhaps 5 degrees between the • night shot and day shot, but the distance matches. With that, it's clear that the night shot shows no indication of horizontal mo- tion effects. \"If there was any vertical motion it would have shown as a bluffing of the horizon, which is not apparent in the vari- able layers shown below. This is consis- tent with a continuous light source mov- ing towards the photographer or moving in an upward direction.\" The witness noted that the \"air was surreal and it was quiet.\" This condition has been noted by witnesses in other cases and is part of the complex known as the \"Oz\" factor. The sudden vanishing of an object is also unusual, but not atypical of UFO sightings. These items are further indica- tions of a genuine anomaly. The reference photos allow calculation of angular diameters. The angular diam- eter of the UFO at the narrowest part is 0.32 degrees. Since the full moon is approx. 0.5 degrees, the object could not be the moon. The witness stated that the moon was rising to the southeast of the object, and that it went into eclipse later, which is true. The witness' estimate that the object was 30 feet in the vertical dimension is reasonable, based on the measurements and calculations. The witness states the picture was taken on a digital camera. Since an ordi- nary digital camera cannot take multiple exposures, the statement by another UFO researcher that this was probably a mul- tiple exposure is incorrect. My conclusion is that the object is un- usual and unidentified. -William I. McNeff \\-w&?,i\\ — * '^;;->.*& -•f 4,^1 ^ ;j '5:^f^;r Iff/'-*; -^5^v; Figure 1. Maccabee analyzes 2004 Mexican flight radar & flir By Bruce Maccabee MUFON Photo Analyst Introduction During a Mexican Department of Defense (DOD) surveillance flight over the Yucatan peninsula on March 5, 2004, the flight crew encountered a strange ra- dar target and subsequently recorded on videotape what appeared to be a small fleet of unidentified infra-red (ir) radia- tion sources traveling along with the plane. The crew and passengers believed that at one time the plane was surrounded by unknown objects detected by radar and by a forward looking ir (flir) imaging sys- tem. They could visually see none of these objects, yet they were clearly evi- dent on the flir viewing screen and ap- peared to be only a few miles away. According to the DOD, an investiga- tion of the event was carried out by the Mexican Air Force and no solution was found. Then, about a month and a half after the sighting, the DOD offered the videotape which had been made during the sighting by the flir viewing system to news reporter Jaime Maussan. Maussan, who is well known for in- vestigating UFO sightings in Mexico, interviewed the witnesses, viewed the flir videotape, and then made a public an- nouncement about the event during a TV show on May 9. Two days later he held a press confer- ence at which he presented the result of his investigation and invited other inter- ested researchers to carry out their own investigations of the flir videotape. The report of these sightings created images a great amount of immediate worldwide interest, with portions of the flir video shown on major news network presenta- tions. People who are interested in the UFO phenomena complimented the Mexican DOD for its \"open door\" policy of releasing the information related to this UFO sighting. Some called these the most important sightings ever because they were officially endorsed by the Mexican Air Force, even though the Air Force did not say the lights and radar targets were UFOs. However, in a reaction similar to the worldwide response to the announcement of .the (then) famous New Zealand ra- dar/visual/movie sightings about 25 years earlier (Dec. 31, 1978), numerous skeptics proposed explanations without carrying out their own investigations. In retrospect (now that an investiga- tion has been done) it is clear that no one, at the time of the press announcement, knew what had actually happened. A careful reconstruction of the events has shown that the original story of the sightings, as publicized in early news re- leases, was quite incorrect. This was ap- parently because the flight crew members, while recounting the events from memory, were somewhat confused as to the se- quential order of events. Fortunately it was possible to reduce this confusion by careful analysis of the flir videotape, which contains images of ir sources of varying brightness (herein called \"flir lights\")-and ground and air scenery, reports by the radar operator, and comments by the crew. After all the available data are consid- 12 MUFON UFO Journal MARCH 2005"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ered it appears that the initial radar target remains as a True UFO (TRUFO) for reasons outlined below. The sources of the flir lights, which were the basis for the public interest, are less certain. Although one light may have been re- lated to the first radar target, it appears that most, or all, of the other lights were (hot) ground sources that were quite dis- tant from the plane (over 50 miles), or bright sunlight reflections from cloud tops. Because their identification is still not certain, the flir lights are not the subject of this paper. A detailed analysis of the FLIR lights and a transcript of the flir tape is available on the internet at http:// brumac.8k.com/ MexicanDoD5mar04.doc (download the WORD document and scroll down to the section on the FLIR lights). Although the analysis of these lights is not presented here, they are discussed below as part of the sighting history. Summary of sighting events These sightings occurred during the afternoon of March 5, 2004, as a C-26 surveillance airplane operated by the Mexican DOD was flying over the Yucatan peninsula along the track illus- trated in Figure 1. (The location of the plane at any time is determined by. the latitude and longitude presented by the infra-red viewing system described below.) Initially the plane was headed north- west and was flying near Candelaria when the first radar target was detected. The plane made a turn to the left and followed the target as it traveled toward Ciudad del Carmen. Figure 1 shows the track after this ini- tial left turn that occurred at about 16:43:15 (4:43 PM and 15 seconds). (Times are given in 24-hour notation. For example, 13:00:00 is 1 PM, 14:05:10 is 5 minutes and ten seconds after 2 PM, etc.) However the plane was running out of fuel, so at about 16:51:30 the pilot began a right turn to travel eastward toward the air base. This turn was completed at about 16:53, and the plane traveled directly east- ward for several minutes before turning onto a heading of about 82°. (Azimuth angles relative to the ground are based on clockwise rotation from true north. North is 0° , due east is 90°, due south is 180°, due west is 270°, etc. Nega- tive azimuth numbers are rotations to the left: -90° is due west, the same as a rota- tion to the right of 270°). At about 4:42 PM the plane was at an MARCH 2005 altitude of about 2 miles (statute miles are used in this report unless otherwise noted). It was flying at about 230 mph (statute miles per hour), heading approxi- mately northwest, and was near the city of Candelaria. It was nice flying weather with a some- what hazy atmosphere, a 6 mph tailwind from the southeast, and scattered cumu- lus clouds, many with tops at the altitude of the airplane. The radar, which was tilted about 30° down and continually rotating about a vertical axis (thus sweeping out a conical volume beneath the plane), suddenly de- tected an unexpected target about 5 miles ahead. It was moving approximately northwestward, but more slowly than the C-26 surveillance aircraft. This target was about 30 degrees to the left of straight ahead of the C-26. The immediate assumption by the crew was that they had detected a small airplane that had just taken off, probably from an air- field near Candelaria, so the C-26 turned to follow it. Over the next couple of minutes the C-26 approached to a radar-determined distance of about 2.4 miles as the object increased speed in a somewhat erratic way. The C-26 followed the object for about 10 minutes, never getting any closer. The crew noted four unusual charac- teristics of this radar target: (a) its sud- den appearance at a short distance, (b) somewhat erratic speed changes, accord- ing to the radar, (c) \"invisibility\" (it could not be seen visually despite the short dis- tance) and (d) lack of a thermal signa- ture, as it was not detected by the \"for- ward looking infrared\" (flir) viewing equipment on the airplane. The operator of the flir device (which can look in all directions, not just forward) began a search for the radar object (\"tar- get\") as soon as it was reported by the radar operator. The flir output was recorded on a vid- eotape that recorded flir imagery (and occasional, brief normal TV images) as well as recordings of the conversations by the air crew. This flir videotape is the primary source of information about the sighting events. The flir device can detect not only the hot engines, but also the body of the air- craft itself, making an image which can be recognized as that of an airplane. The flir operator used the variable elevation and azimuth of the flir optical system to search the sky and ground in the general MUFON UFO JOURNAL direction of the radar target. Numerous ground level objects, which were either sunlight reflectors or sources of heat, were observed, but no flir light seemed to definitely correlate with the radar target. However, just before the plane turned to fly eastward , a bright flir light was de- tected which might have been in the same direction as the radar target. Then, be- cause of low fuel, the C-26 had to make a right turn eastward toward the air base. The radar target continued on its west- northwest track, thus moving away from the C-26. It was followed by radar until it arrived in the vicinity of Ciudad del Carmen on the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, more than 40 miles behind the plane. By that time its speed had increased to over 380 mph, according to the radar system, and it then faded from the radar. The consistency of appearance on the radar scope, the continuous motion with acceleration, and the short distance to the radar target during most of the time seem to remove this from the general class of spurious targets known generally as \"ra- dar angels.\" Questions raised The radar data raise two important questions: (1) what object that is large enough to be detected by the (3 cm) ra- dar radiation at a distance of up to 40 miles would, in spite of its size, be invis- ible to the human eye and to a flir system when it was only about 2 miles away, and, (2) what type of object can travel at hun- dreds of miles an hour without generat- ing a heat signature of some sort? Just before the plane began its right turn to the east, the flir operator picked up a very bright light (a heat source or a reflector of sunlight) about 12° to the right of straight ahead and at an angular elevation of about -4° (four degree angle downward). The sudden appearance raises the fol- lowing question: if this light was on the ground, as suggested by the downward elevation,- why wasn't it detected earlier (by this time the plane had been flying in the direction of this light for many min- utes)? The air crew apparently thought that this light was the radar target. Unfortu- nately it was recorded on the video tape for only a few seconds, not enough time to prove that it was (or wasn't) the radar target. Although numerous other anomalous 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"flir lights were observed later on, this is the only one which was detected ahead of the aircraft. All the others were 90° or more to the left of straight ahead. The flir videotape has a \"time jump\" of 61 seconds (recording turned off) while the plane turned about 148 degrees to the right. When the video recording resumed, the plane was leveling out on the new track, flying due east. The video at this time shows various views of the side and top of a cloud. As the flir operator searched for the previ- ous light, a much dimmer version of it or what was, more probably, a completely different light suddenly appeared from behind the right side of a cloud. It seemed to move to the right past the clouds. It appeared to be at the distance of the clouds or beyond the clouds. To its right was a much brighter light that the flir operator apparently did not no- tice because it was at the right edge of the field of view for only a few frames of the video. The flir operator tracked the dimmer light (not the very bright one). It seemed to be at the level (altitude) of the aircraft, and seemed to be traveling along with the plane. (Note: the appearance of \"travel- ing along with the airplane\" can be an illusion caused by watching very distant light as the plane passes by relatively nearby clouds.) During this time the radar target con- tinued toward Ciudad del Carmen, finally disappearing at the limit of the range of the radar, somewhat more than 40 miles. At that time the flir light which was first seen after the right turn was at about -135 azimuth (135° to the left of straight ahead) and the radar target, as stated by the radar operator, was at about the 7 o'clock direction (-150°). (In \"clock\" notation, hours become angles relative to the forward direction of the plane. Thus, 12:00 is straight ahead, 9:00 is 90° to the left, 3:00 is 90° to the right and 6:00 is directly behind. The individual \"hours\" are 30° apart, and each \"hour\" represents an angular width of +/- 15° centered on the hour or half hour. Thus a target at 7:00 could be anywhere from -135° azimuth to -165° azimuth.) If the radar target was exactly at 7:00 then it was about 15° to the left of the flir light. If, however, the radar target was at the \"upper limit\" of 7:00, i.e., at 7:30, then the two could have been in the same direction. However, the radar target traveled al- most directly away from the plane. Had the flir light traveled away from the plane it would have gotten dimmer during the observations. Instead, the flir light seemed to main- tain its brightness level, suggesting that it did not get farther away. Hence the flir light that was seen and tracked after the turn was not the radar target. This light was occasionally blocked by small clouds, but then it disappeared be- hind a larger cloud. The flir operator searched again as the plane flew along. Suddenly, instead of a single light he found a group of lights that formed a line. The twins The most notable of these are a pair of lights (herein called \"the twins\") that were so bright that they saturated the dy- namic range of the flir electronics, mak- ing large round overexposed images. A few minutes later, as they passed behind a cloud, one could count as many as 15 lights accompanying the \"twins.\" These were lost behind a large cloud. Later, new lights (or the same ones) were detected in a different roughly lin- ear arrangement that include two bright \"triplet arrays\" (herein called \"the trip- lets\") instead of \"twins.\" One light in the \"triplets\" split into two parts. It was at this time that the flir operator reported to the crew that he saw 11 lights. (This event was featured in the initial press release of the video.) These lights passed behind clouds that were estimated by par- allax and triangulation to be more than 20 miles from the aircraft. Triangulation of the lights themselves, using the airplane track as the baseline, indicates that they were more than 50, and probably as far as 100, miles away (see the above web address for further details). During this flir sighting the radar op- erator detected nothing. He thought this was because of a \"dead space\" in the ra- dar coverage (radar blocked by some por- tion of the airplane) that happened to be approximately in the direction of these lights, which were, again, about 135° to the left. However, the triangulation analysis suggest that another possible reason for failure to detect them on radar: they were far beyond the 40-mile limit of the radar. After a couple of minutes the \"trip- lets\" were lost behind a cloud. The flir tape recorder was turned off for about 4 minutes. When it was turned on again it re- corded a very bright light and two not-as- bright lights against a dim, featureless background (no clouds as before). The lights were at the left side of the aircraft at the 9:00 o'clock position (90o to the left). Several minutes later only a single bright light appeared. It was viewed through the rotating propeller and went behind a cloud top that was estimated at about 14 miles away. There was also a new radar target, this time ahead of the aircraft. The new ra- dar target was traveling at a \"ground speed\" of about 60 mph and the plane was catching up with it. At 5:19 PM the flir operator turned the flir forward and obtained images of the rising moon when it was only about a degree above the horizontal. These im- ages provided useful data for calibration of die pointing accuracy of the flir sys- tem. Over the next several minutes the flir operator searched the sky, but found only a few small, bright cloud tops (reflecting the setting sun). Then the flir operator found a very bright light that appeared against a featureless background. This light was detected almost directly behind the aircraft. Its brightness decreased as the plane traveled along. In the meantime the. radar target had disappeared at the right side after the airplane caught up with it. (It may have been a moving radar reflector on the ground, such as a truck.) The videotape ends, while showing a dim light almost direcdy behind the plane, at 5:28 PM. It has been proposed that the groups of flir lights (\"twins\" and \"triplets\", etc.) were actually fires burning waste gas from oil wells in the Cantarell oil field which, as shown in Figure 1, was in the same area as the groups of flir lights after the right turn. In principle it should be possible to match up each flir light with a gas fire. However, it has not been possible to do this simple test. The oil field explanation could be proven or disproven by reflying the flight during similar weather. However, despite numerous requests, the Mexican DOD has not (to my knowl- edge) done this experiment. For analysis of the proposed oil field explanation see the above web site and also www.alcione.org/FAM/ FLIR CONCLUSION.html. 14 MUFON UFO Journal MARCH 2005"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Saving humanity The Allies of Humanity, Book Two, Hu- man Unity, Freedom & The Hidden Reality of Contact by Marshall Vian Summers, 2005, New Knowledge Library, nkl@greatercommunity.org, 303-938- 8401, 202 pages, 6x9, soft cover, $14:95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This second book in the series is es- sentially a repeti- tion of the first (see review by Virgil Staff in the May, 2001, MUFON UFO Journal), so if you missed that one you may be inter- ested in this latest version. The content is based on \"contact\" by Summers with a small group of extra- terrestrials who supposedly want to help humans resist the influence of other ex- traterrestrials who are using humans for their own purposes. These good ETs are called the Allies of Humanity. The Allies reportedly come from some secret place in space, have observed Earth from nearby, want to help humans remain free as we encounter the Greater Com- munity (space/universe), have lost four of their nine members as they tried to physically contact Summers on Earth, and have now left our vicinity to protect them- selves from those other ETs invading the Earth. This contact by the Allies with Sum- mers has supposedly been sanctioned by the Creator (God), and Summers was al- legedly chosen as the one person on Earth to receive the briefings from the Allies. \"He is a man who has been sent with a Divine mission,\" states the Allies through the author, \"to help prepare hu- manity for its encounters with the Greater Community and to represent The Greater Community Teaching in the world, a teaching in the Greater Community Way of Knowledge.\" According to the introduction by The New Knowledge Library, Summers had, prior to the briefings by the Allies, been working for more than 20 years with \"an Angelic Presence that he had increasingly grown to trust,\" and \"what began as an inner voice experience over time grew to be a potent relationship\" which \"prepared him for the magnitude of The Teaching in Greater Community Spirituality that he was destined to receive and to represent. During these years he wrote some 20 volumes, all in a state of revelation.\" This reportedly set the stage for his relationship with the Allies of Humanity, \"who were also students of these Teach- ers of the Greater Community.\" It is explained that Summers is the only person contacted because of the concern that more than one contactee might re- sult in confusing the message: \"When Jesus came, were there a hundred Jesuses, all competing with each other?\" Yet the message itself seems relatively simple-in concept, if not in execution: 1. We are being visited by extraterres- trial races that want to use our physical and biological resources for their own pur- poses, and who will take away our indi- vidual freedoms, says Summers. They are not evil, but have needs that Earth can fill. 2. These ETs are attempting to con- quer us by offering technology, using sub- terfuge, and carrying out breeding pro- grams. They are not permitted by the Greater Community to use force. 3. They can do these things only with the permission or silence of humans, ac- cording to the laws of the Greater Com- munity. 4. Humans throughout the world must unite in understanding the threat and in repulsing it. Those individuals looking for hard evidence that any of this is true will be disappointed. Instead, we are told to look inside ourselves to find that this is indeed something that we just know to be true— an intuition, a \"gut feeling.\" In looking at Summers' (or the Allies') description of what is occurring on Earth, there appears to be some agreement with at least one leading abduction researcher. Dr. David Jacobs, in his book The Threat, suggests that a breeding program is underway with the ultimate goal of a takeover by the aliens. This idea of a breeding program and hybrids has also been suggested by other researchers, such as Budd Hopkins, while still others seem to find a less threatening scenario con- nected with the ET phenomenon. If this attempted takeover by ETs is indeed occurring, then what does Sum- mers (the Allies) want us to do about it? The following suggestions are made: 1. Develop your own awareness by reading the Allies Briefings. 2. Share the message with others. 3. Support human unity and sover- eignty in our world, speaking out against national, cultural, and religious conflict in any form. 4. Support the work of Summers by making financial contributions. The author provides no techniques to aid abductees (Experiencers) in resisting these bad ETs—usually described as hav- ing considerable powers. Do abductees Just Say No, do they call upon religious figures for assistance, or what? Veteran ufolbgist Ann Druffel has at least come up with some specific tech- niques, which are described in her book Hoiv to Defend Yourself Against Alien Ab- ductions (1998). With the Allies now gone from the vi- cinity of Earth, will there be future rev- elations, or is this it? What do you think?

Ms. Emery is also writing a juvenile novel featuring crop circles. The book tells the story of a rabbit, a porcupine, and a crop circle. Miss Penelope, the porcupine, has a very curly coat of hair, thanks to a crop circle being formed around her as she looked for food. The rabbit also .wants a curly coat, so they go to the crop circle and wait for whatever formed the formation to return- which it does—and the rabbit also gets a desirable makeover in the form of twisted ears: \"We've had such fun in these fields,\" said Mrs. Bunny. This may be a book that is better read to children, as some of the words (in- credulously, craving, superb, etc.) might be beyond the vocabulary of the targeted age group. There are also some French expressions (merci beaucoup, bon appetit, voila, etc.) that may not be familiar to all children. The text is fun to read, and the illustrations are quite appealing. As for what children might learn about crop circles from this book, the answer seems to be that crop circles are fun and relatively harmless, which a great many crop circle researchers would question. I also have to wonder about the final page of the book, which provides an epi- logue describing what happened to a real porcupine that was caught in a crop circle. Its quills \"were swirled in the same direc- tion as the crop circle-like formation,\" but the real porcupine was \"rather squashed.\" Not exacdy a happy ending for the model for the book's star, which one would presume the young reader was somewhat fond of. Of course if the book is being read to a child, .this part could be. omitted. And with children of her own, Ms. Emery should be a good judge of what kids can handle.       • But I think this book points out some real problems in writing children's books about ufology, including books about their little entity \"friends.\" Ufology is a complicated, sometimes frightening, poorly understood subject, even for adults, and unless a youngster has had a personal experience with the phenomenon, perhaps it is a topic best left for older readers. Hopefully the talented writing and il- lustrations found in Crop Circle Quill-Do's can be utilized in a future book dealing with a topic more suitable for children.

Illinois MUFON presents school lectures By David Marler Illinois MUFON State Director In the spirit of MUFON being an edu- cational organization, the members of Illinois MUFON have attempted to present UFO lectures to both adult orga- nizations and school groups over the past few years. Most recently, representatives from Il- linois MUFON comprised of Mike Driscoll, State Section Director, and my- self were invited to two public junior high schools in Moline, IL. These schools are using a textbook in their critical reading classes entitled: Aliens & UFOs (published by Jamestown Publishers a division of NTC/Cohtemporary Publishing Group). They have been using this textbook for almost three years'now. According to the teachers, the kids love the subject of UFOs and it is this very reason that they chose to use this book. They needed to capture the attention of the children with a subject they would be willing to read about. As a result, the children are learning about a variety of cases, such as the Roswell crash, Lubbock lights, Lonnie Zamora sighting, Incident at Exeter, Kecksburg crash, Delphos landing traces, Allagash abductions, men-in-black, Cash- Landrum case, and many others. At the same time they are developing critical reading skills. It is truly a diverse learning experience for them, as well as the teachers. Mike Driscoll's grandson was a student in last year's class at Wilson Junior High School, and happened to mention to the teacher, Ms. Kested, that his grandfather investigated UFOs for an organization called MUFON:Tt was this passing com- ment in class that eventually launched a series of lectures in Moline. Immediately, Ms. Kested invited Mike to lecture to the children that year, which was well received by all the students. Then another teacher, Mrs. Kelly, from John Deere Junior High School, heard about the lectures Mike had done. She requested that he come and lecture to her critical reading classes the following se- mester, since they too were using the same textbook. Mike agreed to do so, but with one caveat—he needed some assistance. Mike contacted me and requested that I travel to Moline to assist him with the future lectures. I was most willing to do so. On Jan. Ill traveled to Moline, and on the 12th we lectured at Wilson Junior High School throughout the day to a to- tal of five classes, each comprised of ap- proximately 15 to 20 kids. The following day, we lectured at John Deere Junior High School to five classes, each of comparable size. The kids were an excellent audience. They asked articulate and intelligent ques- tions, and Mike and I were most im- pressed by their interest, knowledge, and courtesy. It should be mentioned that we also had in the audiences a number of teach- ers and even the principal of one of the schools. The adults were equally interested in the UFO subject as well as MUFON. After returning home I was surprised to receive at least 100 articulate and com- plimentary thank you letters from the kids. I was also gratified by a letter from one of the teachers. 16 MUFON UFO Journal MARCH 2005"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"FIL£R' Director, MUFON Eastern Region Note: These reports.are presented in or- der to keep readers informed of some of the vast number of sightings being reported.

New Jersey sphere SICKLERVILLE - Ernest, working on a Blueberry Farm, reported seeing a UFO that looked similar to a pale day- time full moon on Jan. 4, 2005, at 9:50 AM. It was maybe 10,000 feet up, and a finger wide. Sometimes the light was seen through die clouds, other times not. The object was spherical, with rough edges like on a round faceted diamond, and was spinning rapidly counterclock- wise. It traveled in excess of 100 mph S/ SW towards Vineland, NJ. It was four human hand widths up from the horizon. The object appeared back in its origi- nal location, but a litde higher in view, for 10-12 minutes, but was only in view for about 1 minute at its second appear- ance. It grew larger to what appeared to be more than 100 feet across as it ap- proached before going behind clouds. He called his friend to check on any astronomical or meteorological events going on that could explain die moon- like object, and nothing showed up in the space or weather calendar. As they were talking the object again came into view. Ernest got really excited and stated that it was getting a little larger and that he could see it rotating counter- clockwise very rapidly. There were edges on the object \"like a Susan B. Anthony coin.\" This is a hot bed for sightings in the past 50 years, and Ernest says he has seen other UFOs over the Mullica River in Southern NJ since he was a child. Odier members of the community and his fam- ily also have stories, including one night when an entire local bar stood outside watching some maneuvers. At 10:13 AM, the object was back in sight, but it disappeared behind die cloud cover a minute or so later, and he hasn't seen it again. He did say there was a mo- George Filer mentary glow through die clouds when it disappeared, which he said wasn't the Sun or a sundog. It was rotating as it flew away. Just before die second call ended the Sun had come out, and die object was in die same area of the sky, but lower and much more solid. Ernie has lived in die Pine Barrens of New Jersey all of his life and is very knowledgeable about his natural environment, since he works outside the major- ity of the time. He is also a, trained EMT, so is good with details and observation. He was definitely excited about something he saw, and he says the idea of a UFO did not enter his mind until it started to move.

British Defense allows for life forms LONDON, (AFP) - Officials at the British defence ministry are refusing to rule out die existence of alien life forms visiting Earth, the Financial Times reported Feb. 3. It quoted from a hidierto confi- dential letter by an official acknowledg- ing that the ministry recorded accounts of people claiming to have seen alien life in Britain. According to die letter, obtained un- der recent legislation on freedom of in- formation, such reports are collected \"solely to establish whedier what was seen might have some defence significance.\" While admitting that \"only a handful of reports in recent years have warranted furdier investigation and none revealed an evidence of a direat,\" it went on say die ministry was \"totally open-minded\" about the hypothesis of alien life. Two weeks ago an anonymous caller reported \"strange lights\" above Kent in soudieast England, while anodier claimed to have seen a flying saucer sailing above Stoke in central England.

A few seconds later, what seemed to be the same formation appeared in the opposite quadrant of the sky, remained lit for about 45 seconds, and again dimmed.

But I saw three tiny green lights in a slim triangular shape as if it wasn't quite perfectly horizontal. \"I could see slight illumination of the three green lights at the points of the tri- angle, and could easily make out the edges of the object connecting the green lights as a triangle. Then, it turned on a super bright beaming spot Light towards me so that all I could see was a large white ball again. \"Back on the highway, I saw numer- ous red objects, and about 200 yards down the road the trees ended and everything opened up to a vast farm field. I could still see many objects out there, so I pulled over again. And again, the sky went nuts with activity. At one point I could easily count up to six red light objects flying in different directions. \"I'm convinced they weren't airplanes, blimps, or helicopters.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. UFO shines light in Finland HELSINKI - The witness reports, \"My friend and I were walking our dogs at 5 PM on Jan. 17,2005, in an open field, and suddenly strange lights appeared and the dogs started to bark. The lights were coming from the sky, and all we could see was this bright light upon us. \"It was like some kind of spotlight, and it lasted for about ten seconds, and then something happened and the light went off. We could see the whole craft. \"The dogs stopped barking and the craft went away with great speed and flames that were blue.\" Thanks to www.UFOCenter.com. New Zealand wing-shaped object AUCKLAND - The witness reports, \"I saw a huge wing-shaped, boomerang- shaped) object at 10:35 PM on Jan. 15, 2005.1 couldn't really tell how high it was traveling, as it was white in color, but very translucent. \"This made it difficult to tell how high up and how wide it was, but if I had to guess I would say about 2,000 ft up, and about 200-300 ft wide. The object was traveling very fast with no sound.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Note: During December many UFO reports occurred over Northern New Zealand. Large saucer over Florida base TAMPA -A saucer-shaped object about the size of two football fields was reportedly seen traveling at high speed over MacDill Air Force Base at 5:30 PM on Jan. 1,2005. The witness reports, \"My brother and I were with my wife at Picnic Island Park having a New Year's cookout, and I no- ticed above the tree line a fast-moving disc-shaped object that was about the size of two football fields. \"The craft had a row of lights around its outer leading edge. The object ap- peared to be in the outer atmosphere over the base, moving at a high rate of speed.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, www.ufo.center.com. Three objects over Chicago CHICAGO - Three objects were re- ported moving south over the near-north side of Chicago at 1:45 AM on Jan. 1, 2005. They flew over the downtown area and out of sight. All three objects were the same color and did not appear to be emitting any light of their own, according to the witness, but possibly reflecting the lights of the city. The color of the objects was a muted pinkish hue, about the same color as the haze on the horizon glowing from the city lights. \"At first I thought the objects were clouds or smoke from New Year's Eve fireworks,\" says the witness, \"but then I realized that the sky was perfectly clear, and two of the objects were changing shape in what appeared to be a controlled movement. \"One object was flying significantly higher, but its shape was unlike any air- craft. They all followed the same slow path, but the lower objects were amor- phous, tubular, and long. \"They kept twisting and contorting themselves, moving towards each other and back away, at times meeting with each other to form new shapes.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, www.Ufo.Center.Corn Indiana object near power station ROCKVILLE - A married couple saw a red glowing craft hovering over the high power wires that travel across the Wabash River east of the power station at the Public Service generator on US 41 on Dec. 18, 2004, at 7PM. According to the witnesses, it was about 35 feet in diameter, glowing red all over, and was extra bright on the bottom. It was hovering about 150 feet high and had fast strobing lights on the top and bottom that were white. \"We kept driving,\" says the witness, \"because it was a terrifying event! It was not an aircraft; it WAS a UFO!\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, www.ufo.center.com Rhode Island circle PAWTUCKET - At 8 PM on Jan. 2, 2005, a sphere hummed overhead while flashing red and blue, then slowly de- parted to the east into South Attleboro over Route 95. \"We saw it for five minutes,\" 'says the witness.

MARCH 2005 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PERCEFT10NI By Stanton T. Friedman Speed of light and UFOs As MUFON UFO Journal readers know from the recently reprinted outstanding British Interplanetary Science Journal article by Deardorff, Haisch, Maccabee, and Puthoff, it is no longer necessary to claim that the laws of physics prevent interstel- lar travel. The article looks at advanced theoreti- cal concepts such as string theory to pro- vide truly exotic travel mechanisms, or parallel universes. However, it hasn't re- ally been necessary to exclude not-so-ex- otic techniques for many years. The fusion propulsion systems I worked on 40 years ago can eject charged particles having 10 million times as much energy per particle as they can get in a dumb old chemical rocket. I bring this up because I keep running across proclamations about interstellar travel claiming that it would take thou- sands of years and huge amounts of en- ergy to go to even nearby stars. Usually no basis is given, other than things can't go faster than the speed of light, and it is many light years to the near- est star ad nauseum. Here is a quote from a soon to be pub- lished book, Is ET Here?, by Robert Trundle, PhD, referring to negative aca- demics: \"aliens from another solar sys- tem would have to travel many tens of thousands of years from even the nearest star system.\" This is balderdash. After all, even at half the speed of light it would take only about 10 years to get to the nearest star. But how about the time to accelerate to the speed of light (listed as c)? The problem here is that most noisy negativists have no idea how to relate ac- celeration to the real world, nor how to relate to the speed of light. On many occasions when speaking on a college campus I have had the opportu- nity to do classroom visits and sometimes physics or astronomy seminars or collo- quia. Typically I talk about \"Flying Sau- cers and Physics.\" Often I am quietly warned by the stu- dent I am dealing with that the professor is quite negative about UFOs. In these cases I make sure to cover topics I have found most academics know nothing about, such as fission and fusion nuclear rockets, nuclear aircraft, and the electro- magnetic submarine. I put dia- grams on the board and ex- plain, and then I ask if every- one is familiar with these sys- tems. Almost never is any- body familiar. Then I ask two easy ques- tions: 1. What is the value of G, the acceleration Stan Friedman of gravity at the surface of the Earth? and 2. What is the speed of light in a vacuum? All the students immediately answer 9.8 meters per second squared to the first, and 186,000 miles (or 300,000 km) per second to the second. These are correct, but meaningless, as they realize when I ask how does 1G re- late to a Corvette? I get only blank stares. We physicists are terrible when it comes to using measurement units that mean anything in our real world. Nobody measures anything in terms of meters per second squared or miles per second. A much simpler way to understand is that 1G is about 21 miles per hour (mph) per second. So if one accelerates at a constant rate to 60 miles per hour in 6 seconds, that would be an acceleration of 10 mph per second or about 0.5 Gs. I point out that how many Gs pilots or astronauts or anybody else can handle without damage depends on many fac- tors, such as the duration, direction, mag- nitude, restraints, etc. A trained pilot can perform a tracking task while being accelerated at 14 Gs for 2 minutes. That is about 300 mph per second. This leads to 36,000 mph at the end of the 2-minute period. Astronauts have to withstand several Gs for many minutes at the beginning and end of each orbital flight. Then I get somewhat sneaky and ask a multiple choice question: How long does it take at 1 G to reach c? 1,000, 100, 10, or 1 year? Many vote for 100 or 1,000 years. The correct answer is 1 year. I also point out that c is about 670,000,000 miles per hour. This is con- venient because planetary distances in the solar system tend to run in the hundreds of millions of miles. Radio signals from the Cassini space- craft in orbit around Saturn take about 1.4 hours to reach earth. Even Pluto is only a few light hours away. Rarely do the naysayers bring up the fact that time slows down for things mov- ing close to the speed of light. How much time dilation occurs is dependent on how close to c one gets. At 99.9% of the speed of light, one can travel 37 light years in 20 months pi- lot time. At 99.99% of the speed of light one can travel 37 light years in 6 months pilot time. But horrors, say the negativists, the people left behind would age 74 years during the round trip. So? Sounds like the gift of immortality to me. One might want to take one's family along in the huge mother ships that have been seen. The skeptics haven't finished, of course. They point out that just as time slows down at speeds close to diat of light, the mass increases, and it would take a truly enormous amount of energy to accelerate. There are two important kickers here. One is that in a fusion system fusing deu- terium and helium-3, the very energetic charged particles are born with a huge amount of energy and do not need to be accelerated to high exhaust velocity. The second point is that one would un- doubtedly take advantage of cosmic free- loading, such as using the gravitational energy of large bodies along the way, just as Cassini got free boosts from Venus, the Earth, and Jupiter on its way to Sat- 20 MUFON UFO Journal MARCH 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"urn. No need to replenish the gravitational field of the planets: They won't miss the energy. Another objection is that \"Look, we don't know anything about traveling at close to c. We would be splattered by deep space radiation.\" We were working on electromagnetic shielding in the 1960s. Fact is we make particles in large accelerators that travel better than 99.9% c. Mother nature also produces cosmic rays, some of which move at very close to c. We study their characteristics when they produce new energetic particles when interacting with molecules of the atmosphere. There are, of course, other objections that are equally false, such as man can't stand such high speeds. This reminds me that in the early 19th century it was thought that it would be impossible to breathe on trains that were moving as rap- idly as 50 mph! As a matter of fact, people on the earth's surface are moving at 1,000 mph just in the rotation of the earth near the Equator. That is why we try to launch spacecraft as close to the equator as pos- sible. In our passage around the Sun, the Earth covers a distance of almost 600 million miles in a year. So that speed is about 65,000 mph. The whole solar sys- tem is moving at about 12 miles per sec- ond or more than 40,000 miles per hour around the center of the galaxy. The speed isn't the problem. Sudden changes in speed (acceleration or decel- eration) can be a major problem. Don't forget that one scientist (Colonel Stapp) took 43 Gs when his rocket sled stopped very quickly from 620 miles per hour to 0, and lived to tell the tale. Many other schemes have been put forth for interstellar travel, such as anti- gravity, laser propulsion, warping space and time, etc. One involves the use of a possibly real particle, the Tachyon. This comes from the Greek Tachus, meaning swift. It has the very strange property of always mov- ing faster than the speed of light, if it is real. Thoughts of its possible existence come out of certain theoretical physics equations which don't prohibit its exist- ence. In the past, this has often meant that such particles (anti-particles) actually do exist. To date, experimental detection of ta- chyons has eluded researchers looking at cosmic ray interactions. If real, they would also violate causality, and might mean that one gets somewhere before leaving—rather a neat trick. I am not trying to minimize the diffi- culty or cost of interstellar travel for a primitive society such as ours, whose major activity is tribal warfare and has only had advanced technology for roughly a hundred years. But my first computer less than 20 years ago had a \"huge\" hard disk storage capability of 20 megabytes. New ones are running around 200 gigabytes, or 10,000 times as much, and operate at least 40 times faster than my old one. Surely we can't rule out alien visitations on the basis of pronouncements from degreed professionals who know nothing about interstellar travel. fsphys@rogers.com enterprises.com/sfhome.html. www.v-i- Sighting results in vehicle & phone failure, and possible missing time Investigator: Roger Sugden, MUFON ASD Indiana Location: Near Ft. Wayne, IN Event date & time: 1/25/05 at approximately 9:43 PM to 10 PM. Witness: female driver, plus prob- able occupant(s) of another auto, cur- rendy unidentified. The witness told me on 1/26/05 that the previous evening at 9:43 PM she was driving her car home from a friend's house when she noticed the driver of the car in front of her turned the corner and nearly lost control. She called a friend on her cell phone, since she was concerned for her safety as she drove behind this erratic driver on a rural road . She told me that her cell phone lost its signal and her car lost all power as she saw to her left what looked like a shooting star come down. The car in front also lost its lights and came to a stop approximately 100 yards in front of her. She said a large green and white glow, the size of a football field, came over the road from the opposite side and lit up the area and both cars, and then a white column of light came down over the car in front of her. The next thing she remembers is that all the lights were gone and the car in front of her was gone. She said her car was extremely cold, and she was ex- tremely cold. After restarting her car and turning on the heater, she noticed that a small plastic bottle of lotion she had with her had expanded considerably. She then drove home. She did not get much sleep that night, and it both- ered her about the disappearing car. She mentioned numerous times diat she has a nagging feeling of lost time. I met with the witness, and we went to the site on Jan. 30, 2005, with Field Investigator Robert Taylor. She seemed to be bothered by the incident, and said that she had had two previous encounters nearby. Also of interest was a neighbor and his son who live next to the field who heard a loud noise the same night, and the father lost his satellite dish signal. The son said he has lived there all his life and has seen silver balls of light in the field.

Tsunami quake slowed rotation of Earth NASA scientists studying the Indone- sian earthquake of Dec. 26, 2005, calcu- lated that it slighdy changed our planet's shape, shaved almost 3 microseconds from the length of the day, and shifted the North Pole by several centimeters. R. Benjamin Fong Chao, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, and Dr. Richard Gross, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said all earthquakes have some effect on Earth's rotation. It's just that the effects are, usually, barely noticeable. This one was not usual, registering nine on the modified Richter scale, making it the fourth largest quake in one hundred years.

I no- ticed airplanes all over the sky, and the reflection of the Sun would make them appear as a little speck, and some had a small trail behind them. \"This craft was large compared to the airplanes, and it also had a trail. There were also two smaller crafts side by side in front of the large craft. The larger craft was at least 50 times bigger in size. \"The smaller crafts were also leaving trails of light, so I could tell they were moving. The smaller crafts were 100 times larger than the airplane specks. But see- ing as how they appeared to hover in the sky, maybe this is why they appeared to be much larger. \"The large craft was somewhat of a triangular shape, but the outlines were not well-defined. It was almost a little blob- like. The two (smaller) crafts in front looked more round. This was rush hour in southern California on a busy freeway. \"After traveling on another freeway, I couldn't see them, as I was facing east, and they were now southwest of my car. \"I was telling a co-worker about it, and she was about 45 minutes northeast of where I was at the time, and she saw it at around the same time. \"But she didn't see the two lights leadr ing the larger craft.
