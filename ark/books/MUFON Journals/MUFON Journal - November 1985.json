According < to the report which appeared in The Herald newspaper on August 2nd, Commander of the Zimbabwe Air Force, Air Marshall Azim Daudpota said, \"This was no ordinary unidentified flying object. Even the two fighter pilots had visual contact with it over Bulawayo.\" The object, orange in colour in some reports, was sighted first over Beit Bridge (the border post between South Africa and Zimbabwe) then in Gwanda, West Nicholson and Plumtree, all within Zimbabwe. It was last seen from the Bulawayo Airport Control Tower. Unfortunately, the radar at the Met. office in Bulawayo had been dismantled for servicing and was not working, although according to Group Capt. Sykes of the Zimbabwe Air Force, it was the fact that the object was picked up on radar that convinced the Air Force of its reality. NO BALLOON? \"This immediately rules out that it could have been a balloon,\" said the Group Capt. \"Besides which,\" he added, \"checks were made with the Met office who confirmed that no weather balloons had been launched at that time.\" Subsequently, I spoke to Air Commodore Dave Thorne, also of the ZAF and he felt this was a genuine \"unidentified flying object.\" The Air Commodore told me that the two jets were scrambled at 17:45 and were directed to the object which was hovering over Bulawayo at about 7,000 ft. But as the aircraft approached, the object shot up at a great rate of knots (approx. 2,300 kph) to approx. 70,000 ft. Air traffic at Bulawayo Airport was delayed for several hours while the jets were investigating. One of my investigators in South Africa, Giep Barnard, spoke to Mr. van der Riet of CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) and he said, \"Supposing a stationary object is in a position of say, 10 km altitude, the view to an observer in an aircraft approaching at a height of approx. 2 km, would be that of an ascending object. Depending of course, on the actual altitudes of both object and observer, speed of observer, distances between observer and object, this theory could hold true and as such an illusion of a rapidly rising object would be created to the viewer.\" TWO PILOTS The two pilots involved were C. Cordy-Hedge and T.R. Van Rooyen. Both men were 25 years of age. Cordy- Hedge had 1800 flight hours to his credit and T.R. Van Rooyen, 1500 hours. Cordy-Hedge wrote: The object was sighted on the 22nd July, 1985, at an altitude of 4,500 ft. The weather was \"dusk-cavok.\" It seemed to be approx. 15 miles S.E. of Bulawayo. The aircraft was in a steady climb. I could see the object through the cockpit window and had very good visibility. The object appeared to maintain its distance, but had very fast acceleration at a high altitude before disappearing. It was a bright orange in colour and appeared star-like in shape but was \"too far away to determine exactly. It moved off in an easterly direction at a very high speed.' Cordy-Hedge estimated that the object had moved from 15,000 ft to 80-10,000 ft. T.R. Van Rooyen gave a similar report: he too saw the object through his cockpit canopy and the visibility was good. He, together with Cordy-Hedge, said the observation lasted for 50 minutes. The object appeared as a bright star, initially orange, but of an indefinable shape. It disappeared in an easterly direction at a high speed. He estimated the altitude of the object to go from 15,000 ft. to 100,000 ft. ACTION TAKEN I flew down to Bulawayo, which is some 530 km from Harare, and spoke to N.I. Bull who was the Met officer on duty at the time of the incident. He had written to me in replay to my queries regarding the UFO and I report some of the significant portions of his letter. He said that the previous day, i.e. 21st July, he had picked up several reports of the object being seen over Beit Bridge, Plumtree, etc. No-one seems to know what it was but he took the precaution of alerting the Zimbabwe Air Force at Thornhill. He also heard that the South African Air Force had sent up two of their fighters to investigate but they through the object was a high altitude research balloon and way above the ceiling of the aircraft. On the 22nd July, Bull had seen the object almost due south of the airfield at an elevation of 30°. Through binoculars (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Gweru ^o'Bulawayo da cholfeon Blbemfontein o AFRICAN, Continued it appeared spherical and was quite bright and could have been a balloon coated with some sort of metallic reflecting material. Referring to various reports he was able to calculate that the object was between 70,000 and 140,000 ft. up. : He heard the Hawk jets pass overhead and a few minutes later the object seemed to disappear from view. All this happened at dusk and Zimbabwe being close to the equator, there is hardly any.twilight. It is possible that the sun illuminated the object and when it sank below the horizon, the object could no longer be seen. There was no radar working at Bulawayo at the time as the Met office radar was being serviced. The Met office balloons are lost between 45,000 and 60,000 ft. and there were none up at the time. But the wind patterns at high levels up to this height were not descriptive of the motion of the object. WINE GLASS At this, juncture, I had taken a UFO-INTERNATIONAL WEEK Stand at the .Harare Show and was approached by two young men from Falcon College (just outside Bulawayo). They had seen the object through a telescope and the one described it to me as disc-like at the top with a trailing object beneath. He thought it might be a weather balloon. At the same time, Maria Sullivan, one of my .UFO group in Harare, told me that Mike Williams of Plumtree School had said that two of their teachers had spotted the object and described it as being \"like an inverted wine-glass.\" This description immediately rang a bell in my mind. On October 31st, 1983, there had been a UFO over Rio de Janiero in Brazil, with hundreds of witnesses. The. Brazilian government eventually issued a statement saying that the UFO had been a South African weather balloon. Irene Granchi, a leading UFO investigator in Brazil, had asked me to look into the matter. I was friendly with a South African Opposition Member of Parliament who was sympathetic to the UFO phenomenon and had, in fact, asked questions in the South African Parliament about the matter. I contacted him to find out if indeed this could be true. He came back shortly afterwards to tell me that the CSIR were involved with a French Space Agency — Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales — who were based just (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Figure 1. Copy of a drawing niade by Petrus Erasmus of the object 'hovering' above Bloem- fontein on 15th July,1985. AFRICAN, Continued outside Pretoria in South Africa. I managed to obtain a comprehensive description of this balloon. The balloons are of the infra-red hot-air type. They can reach 30 km altitude during the the daytime and can drop as low as 18 km at night. They drift in whatever currents are in the upper atmosphere and stratosphere. Flight duration is up to 50 days and a complete circumference of the southern hemisphere has been achieved. The size of these balloons is 36,000 cu. meters, about 40 meters in diameter, and the hull consists to a large extent of aluminized plastic material. There are generally 2 gondolas with scientific equipment attached to them. Radio signals are emitted both to ground stations and to the NOAA satellite. THE REPORTS At this time, I received several cuttings on UFO sightings. On Tuesday 9th July, Mr. & Mrs. E.A. Lubbe of Steyn Street, Middelburg (Transvaal) saw a light in the sky at approx. 21:45. The light was very bright, stationary and silent. The area was illuminated for a few seconds and then the light began to fade, all in less than a minute. On the same night, Andre Allen of Kempton Park, near Johannesburg, also saw a strange light in the sky, between 18:30 and 19:00 hours.. The Johannesburg Planetarium, while reluctant to commit themselves without more detailed reports, felt the object was a meteorite! By this time, the object had been seen in Reddersburg, Bethulie and the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam area. On the 15th July, farmers in the Underberg district (Natal) saw a \"mysterious shining object\" moving towards Lesotho. Mr. Peter Ferraz, former editor of The Friend newspaper in Bloemfontein, said \"It was extremely bright and moving slowly in a westerly direction. It shone like metal in the sun.\" There were other witnesses: Ken and 1 Merril Macloed, who run the Underberg Met office; Jose Campos, who is head of the viewing section of the S.A. Astronomical Society in Natal, said that • the object was not a conventional astronomical object. On the 28th July, The Natal Mercury (Natal) stated that a bright \"star\" hovering above Natal had mystified many people. But a weather office spokesman ' at Louis Botha Airport (Durban) had said it was a French \"weather\" balloon sending signals to a satellite. It was also seen on this date from Durban North, Hammarsdale and Margate. On the 15th July, the object was identified as a test balloon launched by the French from a site near Pretoria. Mr. Petrus Erasmus of Wilgehof made a sketch of the object which hovered over Bloemfontein. He observed the object through a powerful telescope at his home. (Fig. 1) (continued on page 19)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"FLORIDA FLURRY By Donald M. Ware On 20 August 1985, Norman E. Hill, a 43-year old resident of Pensacola, FL, called to tell me about a 1977 UFO sighting. He got my phone number from an article about MUFON in the 19 August Pensacola News Journal. He reported a small salmon-pink light that rose from the woods and transformed, through a transparent stage, into a metallic-gold, Saturn-shaped object with red, blue and green lights around the perimeter. The object appeared to increase in size as it ascended. Also reported were E/M effects, sound distortion, mental communication, chest, and head tightness, skin vibrations, and a deep cold feeling. Our first meeting was an interview in his home on 3 Sep 85, when Forms 1, 3, and 5 were completed. His parents were present and seem convinced he is reporting accurately, although they were skeptical for about two weeks in 1977. Then on 18 October, he drove to Ft. Walton Beach and accompanied me to the sighting area. His story follows. COMPULSION Late on 9 January 1977, Norman Hill was driving from Pensacola to St. Petersburg where he had an appointment with a realtor the next afternoon. As he passed through Bristol, on highway 20, he saw a sign for Ora's restaurant, and he felt a compulsion to go there even though he was not hungry and it was off the highway. About two miles past the turnoff he turned around, went there, and for some unknown reason asked the owners if any UFOs had been seen in the area. The couple that owned the restaurant looked at each other, astonished, and said yes. Although it was nearly 11:00 PM and closing time, they brought a neighbor in, Mr. Charlie M., who had told of two UFO sightings recently. Norman spent the night in Bristol, and the next morning Charlie M. took him to the sighting area deep into St. Joe Paper Company property. Then Norman continued to Bristol. ENGINE STALLS On 12 January, while enroute back to Pensacola, he detoured 7 miles north on FL 267, turned east on Sudberry road and continued on the sand road into the paper company woods Charlie M. had shown him. After about a mile his 1972 VW stalled. It would not restart, although the starter and lights operated normally. It was. 8:00 PM, almost two hours after sunset. He saw spires of soft white light come from behind the trees to the south. He got out of the car, and when the door shut, it sounded unusually loud, \"like a shotgun blast.\" He spoke, and his voice \"reverberated\" and was very loud. He heard footsteps come through the woods from the direction of the light spires, but could see no one. The footsteps moved behind him through the car lights, but he could still see no one. Soon a bright pinkish-orange ball of light rose slowly from behind the trees where the white light was. There was a stuffy, tight feeling in his head and chest, and a deep cold sensation in his body. As the light rose up, its brightness went down and a transparent Saturn- shaped object (larger on top) started forming around the bright center. When fully formed, the central light was gone, and the object looked solid metallic-gold with red, blue and green lights around the perimeter. The cold sensation continued, and \"vibrations\" played over his body and caused a slight euphoria. He said, \"I asked the question where this object was from, and received a very mechanical sensation in the head and a knowing that it originated in another galaxy.\" He felt he was communicating with a computer. He said the object appeared larger, rather than smaller, as it rose up until it looked about seven times larger than the moon. Within five minutes it rose to the base of thin moonlit cirrus and departed to the east. He thinks the closest he saw it was about 1500 feet. However, there is little basis to determine actual size or distance. After it departed he drove around and sat in the woods for over two hours and saw nothing else. TEACHER Norman has a BS in Biology and Physical Science from Florida State University, and, through a National Science Foundation grant, became qualified to teach high school Physics and Chemistry. He taught in St. Petersburg until March 1976, and is now employed by an industrial security firm. Following this sighting, he reported it to Tyndal AFB. Various officers showed little interest, and a Colonel gave him Dr. Hynek's CUFOS address. He wrote Dr. Hynek a letter on 23 Jan 77, but got no reply. During the next four months, he returned to the site five times and claims to have seen a UFO three times. One was a high fly-by one month later. Two months later he was alone and said he saw the reverse of his original sighting. A Saturn-shaped object with lights around the perimeter transformed to a bright ball while descending toward the woods and finally disappeared behind the trees. Then on 1 May he and a friend saw an unidentified night light there. He blinked the car lights three times and it also blinked three times. Norman claims to have more than his share of ESP, and before his divorce in 1972 experienced psychic communication with his wife. He said his psychic ability sometimes fluctuates but has not changed noticeably since (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"FLORIDA, Continued his UFO sightings. He claims to have experienced several other UFO or psychic events: PSYCHIC a.) In Nov 67, he saw a very high oval object fly over with lights around the perimeter. b.) In Dec 72, while grading physics papers, he somehow received a description of soft white-skinned people and some information about a formula concerning the force of gravity. c.) In June 74, he was on his bed in Pensacola when he had a vision of a 14- year old girl in his class in St. Petersburg. She reached down, and as he took her hand it felt life-like. As they \"went for a walk\" he could see his body on his bed. When he next saw her he did not mention it, but she asked if anything particularly strange happened to him that summer. When he said, \"Yes,\" she described how she went for a walk with him in an out-of-body experience. d.) In Oct 76, he saw the upper half of two different looking entities appear near the ceiling, a white-skinned female and a grey-skinned male. He got the impression one was the guardian angel of his mother and the other of his father. They were trying to determine which was responsible for him. e.) In Apr 83, again while resting on his bed, he saw a black silhouette of a large-headed man appear from the wall and stand in the doorway. No light came through the shape. Then a green arm \"came out of the lamp shade\" and he heard voices talking about the green snake. He said, \"Its not a snake, its an arm,\" and a mental voice, sounding surprised, said, \"If you can hear this raise your left hand.\" When he did, the silhouettes and \"voices\" vanished. f.) Finally, in Apr 84, he went into his back yard about 1:30 AM and saw a one-foot diameter brilliant white light flash momentarily about four feet above the ground. When he went back out a little later, the same thing occurred, and he got a mental message asking if he knew anyone who was ill. SUMMARY These unusual occurances involving Norman Hill are certainly strange. He does not seem either disturbed or obsessed by them. His latest hobby is growing carnivorous plants. His interest in UFOs seems to be based on a general curosity about the science they seem to represent. Nor does he seem overly interested in psychic phenomena, but he and his parents seem convinced his ability to receive psychic messages is much stronger than most. It has not been tested. I consider his 12 Jan 77, UFO sighting an ordinary unknown because, although the report was highly strange, it was a night light without supporting witnesses. Arrangements have started for our investigator in Gadsden County to interview Mr. Charlie M. concerning his UFO sightings in the same area. CASE 2 One 26 June 85, Charles M. White heard my lecture on UFOs at his Methodist church and told me of his 1974 sighting. He reported a glowing, convex- sided, disc-shaped object that blinked on and off repeatedly as it flew over his home in a clear afternoon sky. During an interview in his home on 15 Oct 85, he reported the following information. CONVEX He was mowing his front lawn one August afternoon in 1974, facing west, when he glanced up and saw a strange object moving to the east across a clear sky. His first reaction was to yell to his wife in the house to get the binoculars and come outside (she confirmed this). When she got out about 40 seconds later, the object was going out of view behind the trees. The object appeared circular when first seen and when last seen. However, as it moved through its closest point, about 60 degrees above the southern horizon, he could see the clear-outlined shape of a convex disk standing on edge. The strangest thing is that it continually blinked on and off about every three seconds. The on-time equaled the off-time, about 1.5 seconds. When on, it looked like a large, white flourescent light. When off, he could see nothing unusual. He thinks it was 3000 to 4000 feet up and moving about 300 mph. Unfortunately, there were no other witnesses to help determine size. It appeared twice the size of a full moon. RETIRED NAVY Mr. White is a 66 year old retired aviation metalsmith for the U.S. Navy, and was also an active reservist. He was a crewmember on antisubmarine aircraft, and still enjoys excellent health. He told us he also had two night UFO sightings, one before and one after this 1974 sighting. In the summer of 1959 he was driving from New Orleans to Pensacola about 9:30 PM with his commanding officer, a Navy Captain. After crossing the Mobile causeway, they turned south on a two lane road. They rounded a turn about one-half mile south and saw a large round light \"like a moon\" hovering over the road perhaps a mile away. They stopped the car and got out. It was like a white flourscent light that lit up the road. \"You could read a newspaper by it.\" Its diameter was 60 feet to 100 feet, at least three times the road width. They heard no sound. They both said, \"I see it, but I don't believe it.\", and they made a pact not to tell anyone \"because they will tell us we are crazy.\" For five minutes it didn't move. It suddenly went straight up and abruptly stopped. Then it went straight west and abruptly stopped. It hovered for a few moments, and blinked out as it got back over the road. In 1978 Charles was looking out of the rear viewing window of a P-3, Orion, at 22,000 feet. Heading northeast near Atlanta, Georgia, he saw a round, white, flourescent-like light that appeared to be 2000 to 3000 feet above the ground. It was moving in the same general direction they were until it abruptly stopped and hovered. Then it headed about 90 degrees away, stopped, then made an arc and blinked out. He said it was identical in appearance and maneuverability to the one he saw in 1959. He did not tell anyone, because he thought they would (continued on page 17)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MASSACHUSETTS FORUM By Walter N. Webb Massachusetts MUFON's second annual UFO Forum was held at the Beverly Golf and Tennis Club on the , weekend of August 17 and 18,1985. By all measures, the one-and-a-half day affair was a huge success. The year's attendance doubled last year's figure; the 300 persons hailed from 17 states and Canada, coming from as far away as Hawaii, California, and Florida. Eleven state directors were represented. Even the weather cooperated, with both days delightfully cool and sunny. MEDIA ATTENTION The event attracted much local media coverage. Boston's WBZ-TV and Natick's cable TV station 'videotaped and interviewed speakers at the Forum (a WBZ segment was aired on \"Evening Magazine\" September 16; further spinoffs are planned by the station). Busy speakers appeared on five radio talk shows, . and area newspapers, including the Boston Herald (two stories), carried feature articles. HYNEK AWARD • Massachusetts MUFON Director and Forum organizer Marge Christensen delivered her opening remarks at 2 PM on the first day. She then presented Dr. Allen Hynek with a special edition of the Computer Catalog of UFO Resources. The document's supplement listed all catalog references to the astronomer's name and was offered to him in recognition of his outstanding work in the UFO field. FRENCH CONNECTION Returning this year in a different role as moderator of the Forum, UFO historian Dr. David Jacobs of Temple University introduced Dr. Hynek, who 8 JOHN F. SCHUESSLER — Dennis Sfacy was to talk on \"The French Connection\" — an account of his recent trip to France at the invitation of the French space agency. The CUFOS Director, however, wasn't feeling well and so Dave did a superb job in reading Dr. Hynek's notes. As guests of the French National Space Center and GEPAN, the official UFO agency, Drs. Hynek, Niemtzow, and Vallee not only attended a two-day UFO conference in Paris and Toulouse but also presented papers that were well received (See August 1985 issue). Hynek's paper centered on the activities of CUFOS; Niemtzow's, on UFO-related medical injuries; and Vallee's, on the computerized screening of UFO reports. Jean Jacques Velasco, Chief of GEPAN, asked the three to serve as a \"scientific liaison\" between GEPAN and U.S. ufologists. With both France and the Soviet Union now conducting official UFO investigations, Allen Hynek's paper concluded by posing the question: \"What will it take to get NASA and our government to make a similar move?\" CASH-LANDRUM John Schuessler, MUFON's Administrative Deputy Director, was next with his oft-told-but-always- riveting account of \"The Cash- Landrum Case.\" John's well documented investigation of this famed medical injury episode has been on- going since it happened five years ago (it has been disucssed frequently in the pages of the Journal). The three victims still suffer from a variety of radiationlike effects; the list of physiological (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PETER GERSTEN AT SAINT LOUIS —Dennis. Stacy FORUM, Continued symptoms in this single incident seems almost unending. To this day, no agency admits to sending up the'two dozen helicopters that surrounded the UFO that night, and no Federal agency has paid for the countless treatments and hospital visits endured by the witnesses. Although New York attorney Peter Gersten has filed suit in Federal Court in behalf of the victims, John commented tha't prospects for a ruling in favor of the Texas witnesses were not particularly bright. UNICAT Final speaker on day one was Florida . physicist and CUFOS researcher Dr. Willy Smith, speaking on \"UNICAT: A Scientific Approach.\" He and Dr. Hynek have developed a new computer file of high quality UFO sightings called UNICAT (for \"Universal or Unique Catalog\"). The idea is to come up with a collection of case data that \"will withstand the most severe scrutiny of the scientific community,\" according to Dr. Smith. The cases selected for UNICAT must first survive three basic criteria: They must have two or more witnesses (very good single-witness episodes won't be excluded), have been written up in a detailed report by qualified investigators, and contain at least the basic parameters sufficient for inclusion in the catalog. Dr. Smith outlined ten groups of 219 possible parameters; physical description, luminous description (lighting), dynamics (flight behavior), observers, UFO intelligence (explicitly or implicitly indicated), UFO- observer interaction, UFO- environment interaction, entities, probatory elements (photos and physical evidence), and miscellaneous. Initially, 400 cases were selected for UNICAT Phase One from CUFOS files. Fifty-one percent consisted of close encounters, and 74 percent were multiple-witness incidents. Smith illustrated his talk with slide graphs demonstrating some of Phase One's preliminary findings. A private dinner attended by 60 persons rounded out . the day's activities. TOUGH TALK Opening .the second day's program at 9:30 AM, Dan Wright, Michigan State Director and author of the Field Investigator's Exam, delivered a hard-hitting presentation titled simply \"Tough Talk for Investigators.\" Many considered it the highlight of the Forum. Good UFO investigators, .Dan pointed out, are well prepared. \"There is no room for bias, sloppiness, and incompetency,\" he remarked. It is up to us to have a thorough understanding of IFOs, to carefully study such guidebooks as the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, to establish and maintain contacts with such local agencies as police departments and airport control towers, and to rely upon a checklist to insure that no essential piece of equipment is left out on witness interview trips. Conducting a proper interview is crucial. Dan admonished investigators on such matters as being objective and unbiased during the interview, allowing the witness to recount the whole incident first without interruption, listening effectively, controlling body language, and avoiding questions that might lead the witness. QUESTIONS (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"DRS. HYNEK AND WILLY SMITH IN SAN ANTONIO —Dennis Stacy FORUM, Continued The speaker asked state directors if they were filling their roles, that is, recruiting a qualified investigative team along with drumming up a MUFON membership. Do they hold regular meetings, have local MUFON consultants and other professionals address the group, make available : audio-visual resources to members, and administer the new Field Investigator's Exam to trainees? Dan then exhorted: \"If not, why not?\" \"I'm just as tired as you are of the cheap shots by debunkers,\" concluded the speaker. \"I'm tired of newspaper reporters getting away with calling us 'UFO buffs'....Let's stop making it so easy for them. Let's get our own house in order and silence skeptics once and for all.\" ABDUCTION MOTIVES Coming back from last year's Forum to update us on his latest findings, Missing Time author Budd Hopkins talked on \"The UFO Abduction Phenomenon: A Spec- ulation on Motives.\" He began by 10 showing slides of scooplike and linear childhood scars of undetermined origin in the flesh of various abductees, including both the mother and daughter of the Kitley Woods, Indiana, series of events. Could such scars represent tissue-sampling by alien captors? Budd then referred to cases of implants allegedly inserted into the nostrils, eye sockets, and ears of abductees. He inferred that such implants might be used as locating devices, for introducing information into the brain, or for removing information. For the first time this fall, the speaker said, two or three wit nesses will undergo C AT-scans in an attempt to unmask these alleged devices. UFO SEX? The remainder of the New York artist's talk centered on \"the most disturbing part of this whole disturbing business,\" and he was frank to admit that the inferences that he would make were \"highly speculative.\" A number of cases still under investigation implied that male and female abductees were subjected to such procedures as artificial insemination, sperm \" collection, acts of intercourse, and, at least in one instance a follow-up abduction where the fetus was removed. These shocking tales of implants and genetic tampering provide further evidence to Budd Hopkins that individual humans are not only being monitored by UFO entities but also may be guinea pigs or hybridization experiments. SECRECY UPDATE Also returning from the '84 Forum, Clear Intent co-author Barry Greenwood completed the weekend program by speaking on \"Clear Intent Plus One.\" He reported that 7,000 pages of UFO-related documents originating from at least a dozen governmental agencies have now been released through the Freedom of Information Act. But he also said a large amount of material is still being withheld. Barry urged that anyone shown a secret UFO report should remember the title, precise date, author, and/or ID number of the report rather than the text itself; \"identifiers\" are far more useful in tracking down the document through the FOIA. Barry, who is Research Director for CAUS (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy), djscussed some of the results of recent FOIA requests. According to one FAA document released in 1984, a NORAD phone number was given out (perhaps inadvertently) to a citizen reporting a UFO sighting. The number was stated to be the Air Force unit investigating UFOs. NORAD now denies the existence of such a unit and in fact has changed the phone number! The speaker described two anomalous reports based partly on files obtained from the FAA and the Coast Guard. The former detailed an account of the strange rising cloud formation witnessed by six airline crews off Japan on April 9, 1984-still unexplained. And the other sighting concerned the Pugent Sound fireball of July 27, 1984, which splashed into the water. Local divers claimed that they spotted a strange disclike object buried in the (continued on page 17)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE MEIER CASE By James W. Deardorff In making a trip last June to Schmidruti, Switzerland, where Eduard Meier and family lives, I had hoped to interview some of the secondary witnesses to the case. However, Frank Stuckert, the English-speaking friend of Meier and his small group of message disseminators, who often act as interpreter, was still recovering from an operation at the time, and the secretary of the group who also speaks English quite fluently, B. Zimmerman, unexpectedly had to be in Munich the same week to undergo medical tests. Thus, outside of merely meeting Meier, his wife and their two sons there, and Eva Bieri, the latter four being secondary witnesses, I could do no interviewing at Schmidruti since my German is even worse than their English. I did look through Meier's four big photograph albums of colored S 1 /^\" by 5\" prints and order copes of any at 5 SwF each (about $2 at that time). About 700 of them, taken mostly at 15 different places during 1975-76 and at two other locations in 1981, show the posing UFOs, and another 300 or so show landing traces and other evidence related to the reported contacts. A 61- page listing (in German but being translated into English) describes the times and locations, and associated information. Representative photos from, this collection, enlarged, have appeared in the Elders' Vols. I and II. INTERVIEW In Munich I interviewed B. Zimmerman for a day, concerning various questions arising in trying to interpret Meier's voluminous set of contact notes. However, she started working for their group only about 5 years ago and is not one of the two dozen or so secondary witnesses ' named in Wendelle Stevens' Investigative Report. Over the telephone she helped me briefly interview one of the secondary witnesses, Guido Mossbrugger, a science teacher, on the credibility of one point out of the hundreds of mind stretching questions raised by the contact notes. Later, by telephone, I interviewed another secondary witness and schoolteacher, Elsi Moser of Zurich, who speaks English fluently. She affirmed that she was a witness to nighttime UFO lights associated with one of Meier's contacts. MESSAGE Thus, what little I could observe on the trip merely confirmed what one would expect of a true contactee and genuine secondary witnesses. They seem dedicated to letting sincerely interested people learn the spiritual message to which they have been exposed, but also dedicated to not turning the affair into a cult with a guru. They are upset to hear that anyone can still feel the affair could be a hoax, and are actually much more interested now in the spiritual message from the contact notes than in affirming over and over the reality of the photographs and movie footage. The spiritual message seems to be the main point of it all, although the contact notes also contain much in the nature of general science. About 7 of the secondary witnesses live on the premises of the Meier • residence. Another several dozen of his supporters, including other secondary witnesses, live nearby in the Zurich area. To my own satisfaction I have determined that in at least one instance, and in perhaps many more, what was passed off to Meier as science was instead an absurdity purposely inserted into the contact conversations and notes. Few scientists therefore would wish to defend the reality of the purported science in these notes. However in most instances one is unable to distinguish for sure between what seems to be an absurdity and what '•' might merely be an indication of advanced alien technology which would r seem occult. The reason behind the purposeful absurdities in the contact notes is apparently to keep scientists disinterested, and therefore governments also. Then this UFO case, like all others, will not be the cause of any sudden worldwide realization and panic that UFOs are real and that extraterrestrials are around. This reason turns out to be consistent with general explanations within the contact notes themselves. PREVIEW Before inquiring from Walt Andrus about the availability of Wendelle Stevens' Investigation Report on the Meier case, or of other detailed information on the case, the interested reader should ask the following questions. 1) Would my religious views, if any, be incompatible with a universal spiritual message from aliens whose civilization dates back hundreds of thousands of years? Would I refuse to question the basis of my own religious' faith? 2) Do I believe that our present day science is near the pinnacle of what science of the future could ever achieve, and that no alien race tens of thousands of years in advance of us could perform acts which to us would seem like magic or put science fiction to shame? 3) Would I allow what I read in the contact notes to influence my judgement on the degree of-validity of the physical evidence involved in the case? If your answer to any of these is yes, there is no point in your inquiring further into the Meier case, or spending money on the materials.

Unfortunately, my copy of this issue must have vanished .into the Bermuda Triangle in transit (as it never arrived) — and it has taken me some time to see a copy of the article, thanks to Ray Boeche. I was expecting the worst, and planning an even more vigorous response than the one already submitted to Lucius Parish's rash statements. However, I received a surprise. Whilst the Parish letter does deeply concern me, since it asserts a number of things I know to be untrue, I found the Ziedman piece fair and reasonable. There is little in it I would quibble over. RUMORS , As Brenda Butler and Dot Street's \"mentor\" on the case, according to Ziedman (although, in fact, I have interviewed witnesses and visited both the site and the base several times), I was myself acutely aware of .the lack of 'direct eye-witness testimony. It was one of the perennial problems of this bothersome case. Much of what I had to work with for the book, by late 1983, was second-hand. But almost none of it was the third-hand material alleged by Ziedman (except whenever supportative anecdotes are quoted). There was some first-hand material (see, for example, the verbatim quotes from' \"Art Wallace\"/Larry .Warren in the chapter. \"The Wallace Tapes.\" Yet her principal point is a valid one. The book is not a scientific discussion of the case and was never intended to be. It was produced in the one and only way such a book could be written in 1983, presenting the mish- mash of rumors, accounts and counter rumors (as confusing and contradictory as they inevitably were). 12 In fact, had we waited six months to write the book it might have been very different. Probably not. The material on the case of a first hand nature which Ray Boeche collated for MUFON, which we also collated in England, and which is demonstrated on the \"Halt\" tape recording, largely came as a result of our book. We deliberately aimed to tell what we had so as to stimulate other researchers into digging for paydirt. Sadly, this is a policy which is not being followed by certain other investigators, who are protecting their first hand material for their own reasons — and behaving (in my view) contrary to both, the free flow of information arid the good of ufology. This is something, at least, we cannot be accused of. TIME FACTOR You must see our rush into print in the light of two things in late 1983. The British media stories forced our hand. We had to counteract the sensationalist rubbish that was emerging with the facts. And we had to do it fast. Also we were induced by the apathy and ridicule heaped onto us from all quarters in our two years of work before 1983. Yes, in a sense, the book was, premature. And we paid for it in sales, because it is not easy to comprehend. But I would do exactly the same again, for we wanted to catalyse others into action in places where some good could be done. We achieved that. So we did all that we expected. HALT'S ROLE Colonel Halt's role certainly is crucial, as Jennie Ziedman says. Why did he set himself up as a scapegoat (or allow himself to be set up)? Why was the carefully contrived \"memo\" and then the \"tape\" released when it was? Both these questions are fundamental because they emphasize the importance of the second night (29-30 December 1980), when Halt himself alleges involvement. Since, in my view, it is the first night (27 December 1980) which reflects the main event, this shift of emphasis smells fishy to me. There is also nothing on the Halt memo or tape which is inexplicable. Much of it is perfectly, consistent with the Ian Ridpath lighthouse theory. Now I do not believe that Ridpath, is right, and the lighthouse is the sole (or even principal) stimulus for this case. However, we do have to assess the truth, and the documented evidence which has been \"fed\" to us seems to support his view. Which may, of course, be precisely the point! Halt refuses the lighthouse solution. Yet, despite the fact that others have gone public (including Colonel Ted. Conrad — who did not suffer for his pains and was promoted to General), plus Halt's claim that he has not had any pressure to prevent him from talking, he has failed to react. You would expect a witness whose observational faculties have been called into such question to reply vehemently. Halt declines to do so. This is one of many questions still outstanding on this case. Jennie Ziedman does make one point I take issue over. She claims that I state that no people remained on base in 1983 who had been there in 1980.1 have not said this. Halt, as a prime example, refutes it immediately! I have always known that there were one or two there who had been since 1980, but none who were involved in the events. They were all moved off. That is a different kettle of fish altogether. QUESTIONS REMAIN I know this case is confusing and would not quarrel with Jennie Ziedman's term \"convoluted\" for our book. But it is entirely honest. By failing (continued on page 17)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"NEWS'NVIEWS In 1980 Dr. Leo Sprinkle, then Director of Counseling and Testing at the University of Wyoming, invited to Laramie about twenty UFO \"contactees\" whom he had hypnotically regressed to their UFO encounters. His purpose in bringing them together was to give them an opportunity to share and compare their experiences, to search for .patterns, and to consider whether they should \"go public\" with their stories. A real bond of friendship was established among the fifteen who were able to be there. Since then the annual meeting has been open not only to those who have had personal experiences, but also to UFO investigators and to the interested public. Although Dr. Sprinkle has lowered his profile in UFO research for personal and professional reasons, his presence and personality still sustain the conferences sponsored by a 1 small enthusiastic Laramie group, PRO-UFO (Paranormal Research Organization for UFO Studies). . Often a person who has been at the MUFON annual Symposium will see familiar faces in Laramie. Last year two speakers, Paul Norman and Hilary Evans, spoke at both conferences. This year Ken McLean, Wyoming State Director for MUFON, who spoke at a special meeting in St. Louis on public relations, was master of ceremonies. The emphasis in Laramie is still on the personal aspects of the UFO experience. One morning was spent in group discussion, and one afternoon was a closed session, no press or tape recorders, so that speakers could tell their stories to a sympathetic audience in confidence. This brought out some tales that lapped upon the wilder shores of ufology. In a more down to earth vein, Jerry Clark, Associate Editor of Fate magazine and new editor of the CUFOS International UFO Reporter, discused with Dr. Hynek's secretary, Ann Eller, the new CUFOS Center in Phoenix and plans for UFO research there. The keynote speaker at the banquet Saturday night was Dr. Aphrodite Clamar, the psychologist who has worked with Budd Hopkins. She has done most of the regressions in his encounter cases. Interestingly, the whole battery of tests administered by Dr. Clamar, but graded and assessed by other psychologists, show that people who believe that they have been abducted by a UFO are a pretty average lot; the only personality traits they seem to have in common are those that might be accounted for by the abduction itself. —By Mildred Biesele Clear Intent The clear intent of the book Clear Intent is tb.prove that 1) there are a lot of unexplained \"objects\" in our skies, and 2) there is an extensive \"government coverup\" of this information. Authors Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood deserve credit for forcing the government to release hundreds of pages of documents on UFO sightings. But they admit right at the start (page 7) that their material is \"not earthshaking\" and does not prove that the reported UFOs were \"absolutely real.\" What, then, can we conclude from this massive compilation of UFO reports? If you, like many people in the UFO movement, believe that UFOs are extraterrestrial space ships and that the government knows this and tries to keep it secret, then this book will help you to believe what you want to believe. If you, like me, note that there is no proof of even a single extraterrestrial visitor, and suspect that a \"govern- ment coverup\" is more a matter of chance and ineptitude rather than complicity to withhold information, you will find nothing solid here to support . either' the extraterrestrial or the secrecy theories. Fawcett and Greenwood's technique in most cases is to quote extensively from the newly-released material, then pretty much leave it at that. Occasionally they toss in an intriguing although unsubstantiated question, such as \"Perhaps even more interesting...is the story of what we haven't been told by the authorities\" (p.40). Perhaps, but they give us no material to back up that speculation. They seem to expect the reader to be impressed by the sheer, bulk of unexplained cases. But many of the cases they report are up to almost 40 years old; do we learn anything from trotting out these old and tired cases? Some of the cases happened in other countries; is it legitimate to blame the U.S. government for secrecy if officials at the foreign UFO site did not announce the UFO at the time? Most importantly: Fawcett and Greenwood do not provide us with much of any information other than the actual 1 report. They seldom suggest the possibility of alternate explanations. They do admit (rather grudgingly, I thought) the possibility that some UFOs may be temperature inversions (p.6), satellite debris (p. 10), meteors and fireballs (p.167), or atmospheric disturbance (p.176). They make no attempt to develop the possibility of such explanations. They make no mention whatsoever of recent Persinger/ Brady/Devereaux studies which indicate that unexplained luminosities often form along earthquake faults and areas of stress! They extensively report such situations as sightings at a military base many years ago, without telling us whether alternative explanations might be possible; surely the least they could (continued on page 16) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"UFO SECRECY BY LARRY BRYANT MUFON sponsors an annual symposium on UFO research and investigation, typically held in major metropolitan areas each year.

SUBJECT INDEX When he joined Citizens Against UFO Secrecy a few years ago, Rodney Towers Beaton, then of Westport, Conn., could have been expected to curtail his work as a C AUS research analyst upon resuming his academic studies. On the contrary, since beginning his sophomore year at the University of New Mexico, Beaton has chosen to align his studies with his activism -- and in so doing has achieved a \"first\" in UFO research. Now founding director of the first organized CAUS presence on a univeristy campus -- Students Against UFO Secrecy (SAUS) - Beaton has recruited about a dozen other UFO- oriented students, has begun plans for a newsletter, and has secured the services of a faculty advisor, thus accrediting his group as an official student organization. UNHIDDEN AGENDA Besides continuing his research into official UFO documentation, Beaton seeks to have his group sponsor UFO-related lectures at the university, to gather local community support for funding of special projects, and to serve as an example of how students can support the growing call for greater freedom of UFO information. No stranger to controversy, Beaton already has engendered a bit of resistance to the SAUS effort. \"One student told me,\" Beaton revealed recently, \"that he would have nothing to do with a group that uses a negative term in its title -- in this case the term being Against.\" To which Beaton might have responded: \"But when you're dealing with a government policy that undermines a fundamental principle of self-government — i.e., the public's right-to-know — then you have no choice but to be against the policy, in (continued next page) ABDUCTION CASES: \"Haunting of Kitley Woods: An Ongoing UFO Saga\" (Hopkins) 84:168-184 \"Missing Time: A Psychologist Examines the UFO Evidence\" (Clamar) 81:76- 78 \"UFO Abductions: The Invisible Epidemic\" (Hopkins) 81:44-58 \"UFO Contactees: Captive Collaborators or Cosmic Citizens?\" (Sprinkle) 80:54-75 AFRICA, UFO SIGHTINGS, 81:80-91; 84:65-77 AIRBORNE SIGHTINGS, 80:151-177; 83:14-44; 83:174; 84:24-43 ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AND UFOs: \"Animal Mutilations: A Decade of Mystery\" (Adams) 84:45-63 \"Cattle Mutilations and the Imagined Culprits: A Psychological Perspective\" (Jordan) 83:102-111 \"Cattle Mutilations That Defy Conventional Explanations\" (Andrus) 83:112- 117 ASTRONAUT UFO SIGHTINGS, 80:122 AUSTRALIA, UFO SIGHTINGS, 84:24 43 CE-II (See also Electromagnetic Effects; Medical/Physiological Effects): Africa, 81:80-91: 84:65-77 Bentwaters/Rendlesham Forest, England, 84:100-107 Delphos, Kans., 81:105 \"Close Encounters of the Second Kind: Physical Traces\" (Phillips), 81:93-129 Indianapolis, Ind., 84:168-184 Physical traces, UFOCAT study, 80:31-52 Sound/radiated energy, 83:128-168 UFO light beams/effects, 84:121-138, 178 White Acres, Australia, 84:37-38 CE-III (See also Abduction Cases): Africa, 81:80-91; 84:65-77 Bentwaters/Rendlesham Forest, England, 84:100-107 \"Entity Enigma\" (Evans), 84:79-90 Project VISIT humanoids study, 80:14 Spencer, Ind., 84:178-179 Tyler, Tex., 80:132 \"UFO Contactees: Captive Collaborators or Cosmic Citizens?\" (Sprinkle): 80:54-75 UFOCAT humanoids study, 80:31 CRASH/RETRIEVAL CASES, Roswell, N.

UFOs are a real, material, physical phenomenon, completely unidentifiable in conventional terms.\" (This would be more accurate if the word \"completely\" were removed, and the words \"at this time\" were added.) \"2.

If our members are seriously interested in resolving the UFO phenomenon, they will not allow this fate to strike down MUFON. * * * The Center for UFO Studies discontinued their eight page bi- monthly publication, the CUFOS Associate Newsletter, with the June- July 1985 issue Volume 6, Number 3, that was edited by John P. Timmerman in Lima, Ohio. It will be combined with their bi-monthly International UFO Reporter by adding four pages to the IUR and increasing the price for six issues per year to $25.00 in the U.S.A. Since the International UFO Reporter and the MUFON UFO Journal are the only two UFO organizational magazines still being published in the United States, it is imperative that both revise their financial positions for the future. As an example: If the annual membership/ subscription price for the MUFON UFO JOURNAL was increased to $25.00 for twelve monthly issues (20 pages), the subscribers would be receiving a publication comparatively 18 twice the value of IUR. If the Journal is to retain a professional editor, it will be essential that he/she receive a monthly stipend for their editorial services. A decision and announcement by the MUFON Board of Directors will be forthcoming in the December 1985 issue of the Journal in this regard. * * * The Staff of the MUFON UFO Journal is formally inviting members, readers, and former contributors of articles to the Journal, to submit material for publication in future issues. Narrative accounts for investigated UFO sighting reports, photographs and drawings are especially solicited. Consultants and Research Specialists are encouraged to share their UFO expertise by preparing articles for the Journal that are applicable and pertinent to their areas of research. Letters to the Editor are also welcome contributions, provided they are of a constructive nature. The subscribers to the Journal deserve and expect to receive the finest UFO publication in the world. Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., author of the book Observing UFOs; An Investigative Handbook, Nelson-Hall, Chicago (1980) has been writing a.new book devoted exclusively to the Frederick Valentich disappearance of October 21,1978 over Bass Straight in Australia. Paul B. Norman, State Director for Victoria, has shared his personal investigation of this-case with Dr. Haines as reported in the MUFON UFO Journal and the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium Proceedings. Since this case has never been resolved, Dr. Haines has explored hypothetical solutions in the concluding chapters. The book will be a 300-page trade paperback, 4\" x 6%\", with photographs. Negotiations are now being conducted with a publishing firm so the price will be announced later in the Journal. MEIER, Continued No individual trek by any of us to Switzerland now, 5 or 10 years after Meier's main contacts, is likely to reveal nearly as much as what the 20 or so trips made by each of those on the main investigative team of the Meier case has already revealed, as disclosed through the forementioned book and photo volume. There is now also available a 1 and } / 2 hour video tape on the Meier case which includes most of the \"beamship\" movie footage. Editor's Note: Dr. Deardorff has provided a list of sources of available material on the Meier case that will be mailed by MUFON to people having further interest in this case.

Walt Andrus gently reprimanded me for not reporting back to MUFON about this incident more rapidly than I did, but one has to be a little more patient in dealing with Third World countries than with speedy Americans. It all takes time, and in Africa, a little more so."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"AFRICAN, Continued Although I was now pretty sure that this is what the Zimbabwean pilots had pursued, I was still not 100% certain. But the matter was further resolved when I received a letter from my contact in Johannesburg, Giep Barnard, whom I had asked to check the matter out with the CSIR. He said, \"I have not been able to speak to the person in charge as he is presently on leave. However, I was fortunate to contact his Deputy, Mr. van der Riet.\" And yes, they had been releasing these high altitude balloons from early in July (probably the 8/9th), the 16th July and on the 22nd July. CONCLUSIONS There is no doubt in my mind that the majority of the spate of sightings referred to the space balloon, including those chased by the two Zimbabwean pilots. Nevertheless, there are several imponderables which must be taken into account. Mr. N.I. Bull, the Met Officer from Bulawayo, did mention that although he accepts that it was the balloon from Pretoria, he could not understand the drift to the NE from Bulawayo (it was seen over Thornhill AFB) later in the evening, as the winds were in a SE direction. Also, there seems no logical explanation for the 'hovering' in one position for such a long time. I had other individual reports (not mentioned here) which also reported this long, hovering stage. There was also very rapid movement from the Northern Part of South Africa (see Fig. 2) to its movement to Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. And what happened to it after the last sighting at Thornhill? Why was it not seen or reported again? And the reporting on the 28th July: what could that have been? There were no more balloons released after the 22nd July - certainly not in that month, so what did the witnesses in Durban North, Hammarsdale and Margate see? I am still trying to trace or waiting for replies from some of the witnesses, but I can't see that there is much else I (continued on page 18) THE NIGHT SKY DECEMBER 1985 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): The giant planet Jupiter (In Capricornus) gleams in the SW at dusk, setting about 8:15 PM in midmonth. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars, passing from Virgo into Libra, is visible in the SE predawn sky. It lies very near the crescent moon on the 8th and in fact, for the SE part of the country, rises behind the moon that morning, emerging from occultation at the dark limb shortly after 4 AM. Saturn, in Scorpius, reappears in the morning sky but remains very low in the ESE at dawn. Venus, passing 1° below Saturn on the 5th, can be glimpsed with difficulty low in the SE early in the month. By mid-December it rises only about half an hour before the sun. Meteor Showers: The Geminid shower, lasting from about Dec. 7-15, peaks on the morning of the 14th. A fine display should be seen without a moon to interfere. The rate is about 50 per hour. Many of the meteors are bright, white, and slow with short paths. A gibbous moon will bother observers until 3 AM at the peak of the Ursids on the 22nd (15 per hour). Halley's Comet: Having passed the earth on its sunward journyey, Comet Halley continues to brighten and by the latter half of the month should be visible to the naked eye for the first time in three-quarters of a century. However, moonlight will interfere then. Binoculars will reveal the object during the first half of December in dark moonless skies. As it moves westward across Pisces, the comet arcs below the Great Square of Pegasus, through the Circlet of Pisces between the 12th and 16th, and passes east of the Water Jar in Aquarius between the 26th and 31st. At midmonth look for Halley beginning at 6PM when it is 50° up in the SSW. It sets 5/2 hours later. On the 15th the comet's position is at R.A. 23 h llm, Dec. +3°6' (1950). Moon Phases: Last quarter-Dec. 5 New moon--Dec. 11 First quarter-Dec. 18 Full moon--Dec. 27 C The Stars: O By now in midevening the summer stars have almost disappeared in the NW; the autumn stars are past the celetial meridian in the west; and the winter constellations occupy the eastern sky. The cold seasons' sky symbol, Orion the Hunter, is well up in the SE at 9 PM. Below Orion's trio of belt stars, observe a fuzzy spot in the warrior's sword. It is the Great Nebula of Orion, a glowing cloud of gas and dust--a cosmic nursery for newborn stars. Beware of that UFO culprit Sirius, which rises in the ESE at 8 PM in midmonth. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus Everyone in Ufology has been vitally concerned about the health of Dr. J. Allen Hynek after his two recent surgical operations. A prostatectomy was performed in St. Louis, Missouri shortly after he attended the Massachusetts MUFON UFO Forum in Beverly, Mass, and brain surgery was conducted at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco, Calif, during October. Your Director visited by telephone with both Dr. Hynek and Mimi at their home in Scottsdale, Ariz, where he is recuperating. I am happy to report that he is regaining his strength and sounded very good on the telephone. I invite our members to personally send greetings and get-well cards to Dr. Hynek at his home address: 7239 East Vista Drive, Scottsdale, AZ 85253. It is also a pleasure to advise that Donald Schmitt, State Director for Wisconsin, has recuperated from a stomach injury that created a two month confinement. * * * The theme for the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium to be held June 27, 28, and 29 at the Kellogg Center for Continuing Education, Michigan State University in Lansing has been appropriately titled \"UFOs: Beyond the Mainstream of Science\" to reflect the speakers' presentations and the academic environment. Copies of the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings, bearing the theme \"UFOs: The Burden of Proof\" (180 pages), are still available from MUFON in Seguin, Texas for $10.00 plus $1.50 for postage and handling in U.S. Funds. All foreign orders should be by International Postal Money Order or a check made payable against a United States Bank. * * * Michael D. Hart, in Duvall, Wash., has become so involved in the work of the Compufon Network that he found it necessary to resign from the DR. J. ALLEN HYNEK MUFON staff as head of Computer Science. We invite anyone trained in the computer field to volunteer their services to fill this important position by contacting your International Director. * * * Michael Brcin, State Director for Hawaii, is proud to announce the appointment of Kalani Hanohano, of Honolulu, to the position of Assistant State Director. He is a former State Director for Washington State (1973). Dr. Brein also selected John T. Dressier at Hickam AFB to become the State Section Director for Oahu. Douglas K. Dains, living in Port Grain, New York, has been the State Section Director for Broome, Chenango, Cortland and Delaware since 1980, however we failed to publicly acknowledge his selection in the Journal. * * * Even though we are still looking for an interested and competent person to become the State Director for North Dakota, I want to take this opportunity to announce that Ralph Ehlers of Pingree, No. Dak. has become the State Section Director for Stutsman County. As I pointed out in the September 1985 issue of the Journal, we are searching for people who would be interested in filling State Director vacancies in the states of Alaska, Montana, North and South Dakota, and Puerto Rico. Several existing State Directors have realized that they do not have adequate time, have health problems, or new job responsibilities, preventing them from fulfilling their assigned duties adequately and have asked your Director to seek replacements for them. We need people to volunteer to become State Directors in Colorado, Kansas, Oregon, Nevada and West Virginia. Please write to MUFON in Seguin, Texas, indicating your sincere interest and qualifications. Many of our State Directors have not selected an Assistant State Director to share their administrative duties, which we encourage and recommend. We are in the process of revising our TELUFONET, so it is imperative that we have enthusiastic state leadership in every state. * •*• * A letter and ballot was mailed to all members of the MUFON Board of Directors on October 7, 1985 to solicit their ideas, recommendations and suggestions on improving the format, contents, style and professional caliber of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. It was also emphasized that in spite of increased publishing and mailing costs due to inflation over the past 5 years, the annual membership/subscription dues to the Mutual UFO Network have not been increased since July 1980. Preliminary ballot returns stress the necessity for revising the dues structure upward to that MUFON may continue to be a visible UFO research organization financially. We have watched organizations such as NICAP, APRO, and SBI fade from the UFO (continued on page 18)"}]
