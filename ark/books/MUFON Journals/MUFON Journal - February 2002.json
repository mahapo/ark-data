Another look at the Roswell debris photos By Neil Morris Manchester, UK In the MUFON UFO Journal of December, 2001, Karl Pflock says in a letter to the editor: \"...you say the photos taken in Brig. Gen. Ramey's Ft. Worth office do not show ariy tape on the broken radar targets displayed there. Look again. It's there, plain as day, along the edges of the target panels, folded over the struts and secured to the panels. True, the sym- bols aren't visible, but then consider the testimony of both former NYU/Mogul team members and witnesses who saw the debris discovered by rancher Mack Brazel: these purplish-pink markings were rather faint. Clearly, the glare of the photographers' flashbulbs washed them Image 1 out, leaving the tape looking bright white.\" As one who has studied the.Fort Worth photographs in close detail I would like to comment on this statement and demonstrate with a few examples that \"it ain't necessarily so.\" : , From a cursory glance at the FW photographs it's easy to jump to the conclusion that the debris seen in Gen. Ramey's office is that of a simple paper, stick, and foil ML307 radar target. But if the time and trouble is taken to examine the images closely, as I have done, a great num- ber of irreconcilable anomalies raise their heads and plainly say that this conclusion might just be seriously in error. The case of Karl's \"edge tape\" is just one of these, and, like many of the other anomalies, you need good large- scale prints to observe these for your- self. I suggest the 11x14 prints avail- able for purchase from the Library of the University of Texas at Arling- ton, which holds the original negatives James Bond Johnson took that after- noon of July 8,1947. -. In the photographs we do see foil panels with what appears to be dis- tinct lighter edging, but is this the tape as described by Prof. Charles Moore and used by the NYU \"MOGUL\" team with their ML307's launched from Alamogordo AAF in mid 1947? We are told this was a simple \"Scotch\" type tape, but it did have a distinct abstract \"flower\" pattern re- peated along its length, and, though no records or samples of this tape have ever been found. Professor Moore has provided drawings of what he recalls the pattern looked like. Can we therefore relate what we see in the photographs with that in- formation we have from Prof. Moore and the Army Signal Corp engineer- ing drawings from 1944 through to the late 1950's of their ML307 radar target? In a number of instances the answer is a distinct no, but let's just go through some of the more obvi- ous specifics. First, lets get an overview of what we're looking at here. Imagel shows a composite, in- cluding a photograph of an actual MOGUL pre-flight assembly scene at Alamogordo, and, though I believe February 2002 MUFON UFO Journal, Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Image 2 this is from the 1948 series of launches, the ML307's seen in the foreground should be comparable with those used in the 1947 flights. A useful point of this image is that we can see quite clearly both sides of the ML307's foil panels which show they are, as the drawings indicate, nothing more than foil-backed paper attached to simple wooden stiffeners. And this is important: there are NO OTHER ITEMS other than the fastening twine on the ML307's. Just foil, backing-paper, and sticks. Now let's see what we can locate in one of the FW images, the RameyDubose. This is the larger right hand inset image in the composite, as this image gives us a very good and reasonably clear overview of the foil pan- els laid out on Ramey's office floor. I've put markers to smaller enlarged insets of just a few of the more obvious anomalies in this image. Inset A. Shows a point on the panels where 3 of the white taped sections come together at a \"joint.\" Compare a similar joint in the MOGUL image.

Following on from the Inset A(2) fixing is this totally non ML307 feature. Located diagonally across one of the FW foil sheets can be seen the feature which has been named the \"Glyph Panel,\" as it appears to show a series of raised artificial markings laid between two dis- tinct parallel edges. The damaged lower end of this \"panel\" shows indications that an item-possibly a beam-was as- sociated with this panel and mounted to the rear of the foil sheet.  ' Note that no such attachments are part of the ML307 specification, and as can be seen in the MOGUL image there is no indication of this feature on any of the assembled targets in view or on the engineering drawings. Image 1. Inserts C and D. We have to remember the ML307 maintained it's shape through the use of simple wooden struts, and these can be seen in the MOGUL sec- tion of Image 1. The problem when viewing the FW im- ages and looking at some of the visible \"struts\" seen there is the fact that they appear \"hollow\" and not solid wood at all. Insert C shows a section of the long strut in the fore- ground of the RameyDubose image, where some of the surface of the strut has been damaged to reveal what seems to a void inside. Insert D shows the top end of this same strut where a section (1) is pointing \"out\" of the picture, showing that it is indeed a hollow structure. No hollow sections were used on the ML307. Insert E. Though not directly relevant to this argument. it does show further markings on a piece of foil in the form of what I believe is a decorative or symbolic marking which has become know as the \"Emblem.\" Image 2 (top) An image that again does not fit the ML307 explanation. Look closely at the item marked A. This is a piece of foil with a flattened \"I\" beam attached to it's rear surface, totally non ML307, but in addition to this, on close inspection the beam has a collection of dark colored cables attached!. Our humble ML307 was a completely PASSIVE un-powered device. It had no cables or wires. It was just foil, paper, and wooden struts with its attaching twine. So how come the debris we see in Ramey's office has a bunch of cables? Image 2 (bottom) A further piece of evidence in sup- port of the theory that at least \"some\" of the e'dgertapes^seeh in the FW images are NOT tapes. This image shows a very badly damaged section of \"edge-tape,\" but as can be seen, it appears to be hol- low and contains what might be taken as a \"wire-frame,\" the ends of which can be seen in the circled section. Image 3 This provides a comparison of the symbols seen by witnesses to the Roswell debris, together with some ex- amples of markings seen in the Fort Worth photographs and Charles Moore's drawings of the \"Flower Pattern Tape.\" There are other anomalies which I could go into, and of great interest is a recent finding of a \"buckle\" type fastener associated with some of this light \"edge-tape\" (see Image 4). Of course nothing of this type was ever used on an ML307 radar target. Finally, I would like to put forward some image evi- dence that might call into doubt one witness to the \"pink flowered tape\" theory; that is Irving Newton. And though he did not specifically note the \"tape,\" he did comment that he recalled seeing pinkish-purple markings on the edge of a small beam. These markings have been taken to indicate he saw the \"flower\" pattern on some of the edge tape. Many years later, with the assistance of an artist, a drawing of these markings Newton claims to have seen was made. This drawing is included as part of Image 5. In image 5 we have the only image of Irving Newton with the debris. Note that Newton only came on shift at FWAAF at 6 PM, so this picture we assume was taken some time after 6 PM, and possibly some 2 hours after the photographs taken by James Bond Johnson. It's interesting to note that the debris seen in the Newton image IS the same as that seen in the earlier images, BUT a number of significant \"non-radar target-looking\" February 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Image 4 pieces of debris have been removed from the scene-but not all. In Image 5 you will see a small flat beam circled at Newton's feet. This beam is shown in the enlargement. If you study this enlargement, some dark markings, appar- ently raised on what is a metallic surface (as their edges reflect the flash), can be seen. I have been struck by the similarity of these markings to those Newton described and had drawn some 40 years later. Note the two mark- ings next to each other in the drawing and on the beam in the photograph. As this is written, Canadian RPIT team member An- drew Lavoie, an engineering technologist, has been able, with the use of state of the art 3D modeling software, to give us some firm sizes for some of the debris we see in the images. On one of the targeted struts he has mea- sured, some of its dimensions differ by an excess of 125% from the sizes given to us by Prof. Charles Moore, who forwarded measurements of the ML307C target he still has in his possession. Very few of the sizes so far measured in the images seem to fit the dimensions of the ML307, but a few, clus- tered to certain pieces of debris, do seem close. This there- fore leaves open the possibility that what we are actually looking at could very well be a \"mix\" of debris. Some could be from a damaged ML307 target, whether this was intro- duced as camoflage into the debris as we know a coverup was ordered, or whether it was part of the original debris as collected, we may never determine. But as I've tried to highlight in my earlier illustrated points, this still leaves a good proportion of the debris in view within the photo- graphs that is very distinctly NOT within the specifica- tions of an ML307 radar target. I hope you find this interesting, and possibly thought provoking, in showing that what you think you see on first impressions in the FW images, may not be the case. NASA approves search of stars for other Earth-like planets NASA has given the green light to the Kepler mis- sion, which will study 100,000 stars in a search for other potentially habitable planets. The space agency also ap- proved the Dawn mission, which will orbit the two larg- est asteroids in our solar system. Kepler will be the first spacecraft devoted to the search for Earth-sized planets around other stars, and is an im- portant step toward finding life elsewhere in our galaxy, if it exists. Both missions are part of NASA's Discovery program. The decisions mean the missions will now be funded, and planning and construction can begin. Each is slated for launch in 2006. The Kepler satellite will orbit the sun and study some 100,000 stars for four years, looking for planets that are similar in size to Earth and in similar orbits around their stars.

Image 5 February 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Probability Theory and the UFO Reality By Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. It has been said, at times, that chances are very slim, perhaps even nonexistent, that humankind has ever been visited by extraterrestrial life forms, or ever will will be. Nothing could be further from the truth. The theory of probability, in fact, strongly supports the reality of UFOs. Advanced statistical techniques have been brought to bear on the question, but we will restrict ourselves here to some relatively straightforward observations. It is an elementary principle of probability theory that if one knows the probability (call it P 1) of one event and also the probability (call it P2) of another (independent) event, then the probability that both events will occur is P 1 times P2.   ; Thus, for example, if one witness reports an unusual aerial event and another witness independently reports another such event, and if the probability in each case is 0.95 (i.e. 95%) that the event is mundanely explainable, then the probability that both events are mundanely ex- plainable is (0.95)(0.95) = 0.9025. The likelihood, then, that at least one of the two events is not explainable is 1 - 0.9025 = 0.0975, or not quite 10%; less than impressive. But suppose there were 20,000 sightings, not just two. There have in reality been many more than that over the years. There were possibly that many on the single night of Aug. 2-3,1965, when multiple anomalous objects were reported from the Dakotas down through the central United States and into northern Mexico. Let's consider that very busy August night in 1965, and let us make a strongly pessimistic assumption. Let's as- sume that the probability, in each case, that an event was mundanely explainable would be 0.9999. This is indeed a pessimistic assumption, since the objects reported were highly erratic in their movements, and thus were not typi- cal of conventional aircraft or familiar physical phenom- ena. Now by the multiplication principle already mentioned, the probability that all 20,000 events were mundanely ex- plainable is 0.9999 raised to the power 20,000, which is only about 0.13 5 3 2. That is, the probability that at least some of the sightings were not explainable is 1 - 0.13532 = 0.86468, or almost 86.5 %, a pretty high likelihood that not a//the August 1965 sightings were meteors, airplanes, balloons, or, as the Air Force so oddly suggested, the stars in the constellation of Orion. (That constellation, by the way, doesn't rise in August at mid-U.S. latitudes until about 4:00 in the morning; the reported sightings, however, were around 11:00 PM to shortly after midnight.) Let's apply the same simple probabilistic principle to some larger numbers, with reference to the cosmos itself and the existence of life. And again, for the sake of argu- ment and to give plentiful benefit of the doubt, let's be very pessimistic in the assignment of basic probability values. Suppose there are only 100,000,000 galaxies in the uni- verse. (There are in fact far more than that.) And sup- \"It follows that the probability that at least some UFOs are extraterrestrial, given the Roerich sighting, is very high-indeed virtu- ally certain.\" pose there are only 100,000,000 stars in a typical galaxy. (This, too, is a low estimate, as there are at least 1,000 times that many in our own Milky Way Galaxy.) The total number of stars, then, works out as 10 to the power 16. Suppose, further, that, on average, only one star in 10,000,000 has planets-another extremely low estimate, as recent astronomical discoveries have suggested that planetary systems are in fact not very uncommon in the scheme of things. Then, under these pessimistic/low-key assumptions, there should be 10 to the power 16 divided by 10 to the power 7 stars with planets, or 10 to the power 9 such stars: 1,000,000,000.  . Suppose, further, that in any given case the probability that a planet is permanently lifeless is 0.99999999. (And given the billions of years that the universe has had in which to brew \"primordial soup,\" this is again an exceed- ingly pessimistic assumption.) Then the probability that all the planets are lifeless is 0.99999999 raised to the power 1,000,000,000, which is only about 0.0000454. That is, the probability that at least some planets are life-bearing is 1 - 0.0000454 = 0.9999546, or virtually 100%, even under all these assumptions that tend to downplay the likelihood of life. A skeptic might argue, nevertheless, that even in a universe probably teeming with life, the likelihood of our having actually been visited by life forms from other worlds is low, for a couple of reasons: (1) the vast dis- tances involved, and (2) the \"timeline\" problem, i.e. the possibility that a given intelligent life form may have de- veloped, flourished, and died out before our own appear- ance on the scene, or after. But these objections (made at times even by scientists who should know better) assume, without any basis for doing so, the premise that our own grasp of physics is the last word in scientific knowledge. In reality, we may be (indeed probably are) only wide-eyed children, on the first day of school, when it comes to understanding the uni- verse. To older and more advanced forms of intelligent life, the traversing of interstellar or even intergalactic dis- tances, as well as the problem of transcending the con- straints of time itself, may well be elementary, via \"worm- holes\" in space-time or via principles of which we as yet have no concept. But the real probabilistic evidence resides in what one calls conditional probability: the probability that one would assign to an event given that certain facts are known, or given that certain events are known to have occurred. And here of course we may bring to bear the effects of witness-generated evidence. If all such known evi- PageS MUFON UFO Journal February 2002"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"dence were amassed, from credible witnesses, it would run to hundreds of thousands of pages. But let's look at only one significant account-one that goes a long way toward settling the question at hand. In 1926, the Russian explorer Nicholas Roerich and his entire party in the Himalayas observed a high-altitude, fast-moving, reflectively metallic disk-shaped object cross- ing the sky in plain view, an object seen under ideal day- time viewing conditions-and with the aid of binoculars. The witnesses were competent, trained observers. Look again at the year: 1926, only twenty-three years after Kitty Hawk. Clearly, this immensely important sighting occurred much too early for the highly advanced UFO to have been the product of any human engineering anywhere on this planet. And it follows that the probability that at least some UFOs are extraterrestrial, given the Roerich sighting, is very high-indeed virtually certain-unless one proposes a workable alternative hypothesis. And here is what that alternative hypothesis would have to be: that since the object in the Himalayas was in fact seen in 1926, and since it was obviously of a design far in advance of anything fitting into the known history of tech- nology on this planet for that timeframe, then the entire history of human technology, as commonly understood, is wrong. That is, human flight did not really start in 1903 at Kitty Hawk. Rather, by 1926 a sophisticated array of se- cret aeronautical developments .somewhere on earth had been going on for many decades, maybe for centuries, and, in short, the entire accepted history of science from at least the nineteenth century forward has always been a grossly false construction-a fabrication designed by some deep enclave of secret-keepers, for some mysteri- ous reason, to deceive the world. So one has a choice, but a guided choice, in terms of probability. The question is, which do we judge more likely: that Nicholas Roerich and his party observed an extrater- restrial craft, or that the whole history of human techno- logical development is an elaborate, carefully scripted lie, perhaps going back for centuries? Here, as precise probabilistic computations are not fea- sible, one has to revert to \"subjective\" probability. But obviously, in any reasonable assignment of probability val- ues, the extraterrestrial hypothesis is much more plau- sible than the notion that some spectacularly advanced human-engineered aircraft or spacecraft existed in 1926, and that large chunks of human history are a total lie-a lie that has never been exposed after all this time. It is especially easy to choose the \"real Roerich UFO\" hypothesis when one considers the probabilistic arguments already noted, to the effect that probability is high for many aerial phenomena not to be readily explainable in any mundane terms. Total UFO skeptics will always have an uphill job maintaining their position when the theory of probability abundantly supports the notion that the uni- verse is replete with life, and that we are being visited by flying objects that are in many cases unaccountable ex- cept in terms of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Some UFOs are from the Great Outside, and you can bet on that. February 2002 New York SCI-FI video a fake according to Sainio analysis The SCI-FI Channel in New York City has repeatedly run an advertisement that shows a woman riding in a he- licopter on July 24, 2000, near the World Trade Center Towers. She points to a UFO behind one of the towers that suddenly accelerates and flies past the helicopter. As it climbs up out of sight the UFO leaves a contrail. The advertisement says, \"Get the Whole Story@ SCIFI.com/happens,\" then \"SCIFI Happens in NY.\" MUFON's Jeff Sainio has analyzed the 30-second video, and has made the following findings: \"Since careful analysis of the video shows the ex- pected westward motion of the helicopter, and even cars moving through an intersection, the background video appears real, with presumably the UFO pasted in. The violent motion of the helicopter appears difficult to ex- plain in this scenario, with the chopper below the tops of, and only a few hundred feet away from, nearby skyscrap- ers. Such aerobatics seem like a risk to life or a pilot's license. \"I improved my image-analysis software, allowing me to stabilize the image of the UFO contrail. Previously, with only cloudy reference images, the field-by-field mo- tion of the UFO couldn't be reliably measured. With sta- bilization, the UFO motion is shown; toward the end of visibility, the UFO only moves every other field (i.e. ev- ery frame, not every field). This is conclusive evidence that the UFO was edited into the video by a lazy faker who didn't bother working on every field as required for a real video. I re-checked the helicopter motion and merely got better images, veri- fying my previous conclusions that the helicopter did some violent motion, and the blades bounced around quite a bit.\" UFO sightings in Malaysia double in past year Sightings of UFOs in Malaysia have doubled in the past year, and one man claims he was abducted for eleven days after meeting a square-headed alien. The Centre for Malaysian UFO Studies says six sightings were re- ported last year as opposed to three in 2000. Ufologist Ahmad Jamaludin, from the centre, says three of the sightings were reported in Sabah, two in Kedah and the other in Penang. Of the abduction in February, he told The Star. \"This could be the first reported UFO abduction in Malaysia. Although the eleven-day period was a little odd, as most UFO abduction victims usually go missing for two to three hours or up to five days only, the fact that there were some UFO activities around Kota Kinabalu at that time could lend some credence to the claim.\" Ahmad, who has studied UFOs since 1978, says his research on the phenomenon shows there is a link be- tween the UFO sightings and Earth's seismic activity.

Early sighting of boomerang-shaped object noted By Walter H. Andrus Jr. Past MUFON International Director This significant sighting report goes back to April 8, 1969, prior to the founding of the Mutual UFO Network on May 31,1969, and does not appear in the MUFON file for that year. The author, along with a few other founding MUFON members, was part of the existing Tri-State UFO Study Group, affiliated with the Aerial Phenomena Research Organiza- tion (APRO) of Tucson, AZ. The three known witnesses were my wife, Genevieve (Jeanne) P. Andrus; my daughter-in-law, Mary Lynn Andrus (Mrs. Donald L.); and my wife's best friend, Mrs. Lawrence (Betty) Smith. They had just stepped out of Jeanne Andrus the front door of our new home at 40 Christopher Court, Quincy, IL, when the unknown object was sighted. After a full day of shopping in Springfield, my wife and daughter-in-law were preparing to drive Betty Smith to her home at 1620 Vermont Street. This report is considered significant because it marked one of the first reports of boomerang-shaped objects that were not publicized and reported until 1983 along the Hudson River, in the New York counties of Westchester and Putnam and the Connecticut county of Fairfield. The 1983 sightings were described in the book Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings (Ballentine Books, 1987) by Bob Pratt, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, and Philip J. Imbrogno. None of the three ladies remembered the exact time of the sighting, but the sun had already set and the west- ern sky was slightly illuminated (dusk). As they stepped out onto the small front porch, facing west, they were immediately attracted to a long boomerang-shaped object with many variously colored lights (red, green, blue, or- ange, white) lengthwise from tip-to-tip. There were entirely too many lights to count during the few minutes of the observation. The object when first seen was flying very low west to east over the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Don Strickland, who lived directly across the street from our home. The object may have been one block west over 30th Street, which was parallel to Chris- topher Court, when first sighted. (The power line poles along 30th Street were 30 feet tall.) The object was the length of the rooftop of the Strickland residence (60 ft) when it passed slowly over their home. My wife said the craft was flying with an undulating mo- tion up and down, and the colored lights would alternately flash on and off simultaneously as it proceeded across the street. By the time the ladies had taken the three steps down to our front walk and then down six more steps to the driveway level where our 1969 Ford automobile was parked, the craft had flown from over the Strickland home, crossing the street, to directly over our home. It was so low that it passed out of their sight over our roof line. (Our home was two stories high when viewed from the garage level built under the bedrooms portion of our home.) The total observation time was approximately three minutes. None of the three witnesses could remember if the length of the boomerang was longer or shorter than the length of our home, since they were so mesmerized by the various colored lights. They heard no sound as the object slowly flew over their heads.

The animal was lying on its right side. The left eye and eyelid were missing, the hide from the left jaw was missing, and parts of the tongue were gone. The vagina and rectum were also missing. A thorough examination of the area by law enforce- ment failed to reveal any tracks, markings, or signs of struggle from the animal. When the hide under the left jaw was cut away, investigators noticed a greenish-col- ored tissue mass just under the jaw. The green color mark- edly contrasted with the pink of the surrounding tissue.

(Continued from previous page) in Franklin Park, IL, a few days later, my wife related their experience to me. Since boomerang-shaped craft were not part of the UFO itinerary in 1969,1 was flabber- gasted after hearing this report by three adult witnesses. When I tried to analyze the flashing lights from their de- scriptions to explain why the craft appeared to move in an undulating flight path (slightly up and down), I came to the following conclusion: It probably had two rows of col- ored lights the length of the craft, which alternately flashed on and off-the top row and then the bottom row-giving the illusion that the flight level was slightly up and down. I can only record the description of the witnesses, since I was not personally privy to this sighting. No one else in Quincy reported the sighting to me, al- though we weren't as well known then in the community, even though I had given numerous UFO talks to civic organizations. The object was flying straight east when it passed over our residence, which would have taken it over the Quincy Municipal Airport (Baldwin Field) if it had continued straight east for an additional ten miles. (It was not re- ported over the airport by anyone at the F.A.A. office or the weather bureau.) Philip I. Imbrbgno, a featured speaker at the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium in San Antonio, TX, presented a paper titled \"The Boomerang Mystery.\" When he pro- jected a slide of a color drawing of a boomerang-shaped craft on the screen, my wife \"Jeanne,\" who was sitting next to Dennis Stacy, former editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, said to Dennis, \"That's exactly what I saw.\" Previously, she had difficulty explaining some of the details when she reported it to me. Not being an artist, Jeanne's drawing was somewhat crude, but roughly boomerang-shaped when viewed from the bottom. shipped to NIDS in Las Vegas and stored at -85°G to prevent further decomposition. NIDS then consulted with a forensic expert, whose analysis of the eyes and jaw showed no blood in the tis- sue, indicating that the heart had stopped beating upon removal of the tissues. If the animal was mutilated, the mutilation occurred after death. In addition to the gross pathology, samples of eye fluid from the animal's right eye and tissue from the neck area were collected. A comprehensive set of organic extrac- tion procedures followed by infrared spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) analy- sis were conducted to determine the molecular compo- nents in the eye fluid and tissues. Preliminary chemical analysis was also conducted on maggot mass from the animal. A second animal was obtained from a slaughterhouse and left to decompose for four days as a sham or control animal. Tissue and eye fluid from the control animal was subjected to identical extraction and analytical procedures. A compound called oxindole was found in both tissue and eye fluid from the mutilated animal, but not in the control animal, suggesting oxindole was not a decomposi- tion product. The clinical and pharmacological properties of oxindole in animals cause profound sedation, decrease in blood pressure, decrease in muscular tone, and loss of consciousness (Orcutt et al. (1964) Arch. Int. Pharmacodynam. 152,121-131). Failure to find oxindole in the control animal leads NIDS to the working hypothesis that oxindole may have been used to sedate the animal prior to its death and mutilation. Similar analyses of different mutilated animals in the fu- ture will either substantiate or negate this working hy- pothesis. For example, the pharmacokinetic data on ad- ministration of oxindole to large animals is scanty, as are the data on the extent of rumen-saliva recycling of tryp- tophan metabolites. A second hypothesis is that a traumatic event triggered the swift accumulation of oxindole in the tissues of the mutilated animal, but not in the control animal. Since the summer of 2001, NIDS has received over eight reports of animal mutilations from Montana, the majority of which were too old to seriously investigate. Nevertheless, this number of reports in a few months constitutes by far the largest report frequency received in the history of NIDS investigations of the animal mutilation phenomenon. Therefore, the present case should be seen not as an isolated incident, but in the context of a wave of mutila- tion reports in 2001 from Montana. It should also be noted that during the period 1974-1977, the Great Falls area of Montana was the focus of an intense wave of animal mutilations.

New Year's Eve in Washington State KENNEWICK —At 10:00 PM on Dec. 31, 2001, K. Colman, along with three adults and three children, re- portedly observed three unexplainable lights. He reports, \"They put us in nothing short of complete amazement! I first saw one beautiful light that was travel- ing in a somewhat upward yet hori- zontal direction. It first came into my view when it rose above the peak of our shop in our backyard. \"I quickly went into my home and alerted my family and friends. We all gathered on the deck of my home and saw in the sky three beautiful golden colored lights that reminded me of big gold Christmas bulbs. Each object seemed to be gold in color, circular shaped, about the size of a quarter held at arm's length, with a white light on each one. All three unidentified objects looked to be identical. \"As we watched in amazement they rose to a position almost straight above us. They moved in a very smooth way, at a very moderate speed, then hovered overhead for seven to ten minutes before the first light suddenly went straight up and disappeared, just that fast. \"Then the next light moved to what looked like the exact place in the sky, and did the same thing. This light faded away, then reappeared and then quickly disappeared in a straight upward direction. Then, the third light also moved to the same place in the sky, and it too disappeared into the sky in a straight upward direction. \"It was simply mystifying, and totally captivating! I have never seen anything like this in my life it was so exciting. I simply cannot put it into words how completely awesome this sighting really was! The kids thought it was cool. However, the four adults that witnessed these things are just blown away!\" Thanks to K. Coleman Kt0424@aol.com UFOs reportedly filmed in Scotland EDINBURGH — Andrew Hennessey reports that world shattering footage was shot on a Digicom at night by Steve X, an associate of Russell Penman, on Sunday, Dec. 23, 2001. The footage clearly shows three massive mother ships over the estuary beside the city of Edinburgh, :Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal the capital of Scotland. The ships, one half to one mile long (best guess at this time), are elliptical, clearly curved at the front, with the front terminating in three giant head- lights. The two hours of substantial Digicom footage clearly show one multi-windowed and multi-layered mother ship issuing forth bright shiny pod-shaped ships or beings glow- ing white. Over the course of the two hours these ships are disgorged by the mother ship in clear focus as they fly off in twos, or in formation, or singularly over Edinburgh and its suburbs. There are two other ships of similar configuration fur- ther off in the distance. We could not clearly see the other two ships doing the same, as the light capsules were tiny in proportion. The other two ships were decloaked simultaneously in the drop zone of the Lothian's. This wonderful footage is of earth shattering signifi- cance, but also comes by way of several other amazing photographs and other stills by the Penman \"group,\" on top of other fabulous daytime footage by Brian MacPhee, also of Stirling, near Edinburgh. Central Scotland is again confirmed as one of the hottest hotspots on the planet. - Over the piece, I watched hundreds and hundreds of little lights fly out of the mother ship at all levels of the structure, sometimes hanging back so the others could catch up. They flew and scattered in all directions over the sleepy Capital of Scotland-a city which anciently was once thought of as a Jerusalem with its seven hills and its Masonic connections and secrets.

Possible UFO experienced in Cuba MANZANILLO — Nick Balaskas writes that he just got back from Cuba and reports \"what may turn out to be a UFO encountered by the pilots of a Canadian charter airplane I was a passenger on. \"Our Airbus 320 Skyservice plane (flight S V524) was making a nighttime approach on Dec. 14, 2001, to the airport near Cayo Coco, Cuba. We were startled when we heard the engines get louder and felt pushed down into our seats. This was shortly followed by a near weight- lessness sensation. The captain announced that his in- struments detected a false signal of another aircraft in the area, and in the interest of safety he took evasive actions. This was the reason for the sensations we felt. \"My final destination was the next airport near Manzanillo, Cuba, but all the passengers were asked to disembark at Cayo Coco so the aircraft could be cleaned for new passengers. \"I spoke with a few of these passengers, who said they saw our plane \"go around\" after seeing a single red light fly low over the airport as we were coming to land. They thought it may have been a small plane, but could not explain why only a red light was observed. Apart from our plane, there were no others on the ground at that airport that night. \"Getting back in the plane, I told the flight attendant standing by the door next to the cockpit about the red light seen by passengers at the airport (in a loud enough voice February 2002"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"so the pilots could hear too, who turned their heads in my direction). She suggested it may. have been a UFO, and said she would find out for me. I never heard back from her. I later told the passengers seated next me, who ex- perienced what I did, and they thought they would be more comfortable with the explanation of a near collision with a UFO than the thought of flying in an airplane with faulty instruments. Is there any way of finding out what really happened during that aborted night landing?\" Thanks to Nick Balaskas Lights over Long Island, NY NEW HYDE PARK — The witness reports coming home sober at 5:00 AM on Jan. 1, 2002, from a New Year's Eve party and seeing a strange light in the sky. It was strange only because it was ^ascending in the sky next to another aircraft, which was obviously an airplane. The strange gliding light was ascending higher and was brighter then the airplane. In addition, this object appeared to be made of light and did not blink. When it stopped ascending, it changed its color from a white light to a brighter yellow light. It was in the west- ern sky, which could mean it was flying right over NYC no more then 25 miles away. It flew at the same altitude for a few minutes, then did a small, barely noticeable zig- zag movement, and then changed back to a white light color. A minute later it disappeared in the very clear night sky. LONG ISLAND CITY — On Dec. 30, 2001, about midnight, eight friends left a restaurant and stopped to look at the moon and stars. One witness reports, \"What we were looking at started to dart and shoot all over the sky. There were so many! Some lined up in order, and then just went off in their own direction, just to zip back and forth. Others looked like they were playing a game of cat and mouse. They were darting all over the sky for the longest time. The witnesses ran back into the restaurant and called the people to go out to see it. Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, NUFORC, www.ufocenter.com Fiery red light in New Jersey VERNON — A witness phoned to report seeing a huge fiery red light just above the trees over a field on Jan. 16,2002. She was driving south of Route 94 at 6:40 AM about five miles from the New York border when she saw the brilliant red light. It dimmed, then moved to another spot in the sky where it became quite large again. She was very frightened and said she drove twenty miles over the speed limit to get away from the light. This area is part of the Appalachian Mountains, and Earth Lights could be the cause of the fiery red light. The Vernon police were notified, and they mentioned they had received numerous reports of a light near the top of a mountain. Both the police and park rangers were investi- gating. The witness was very upset by the incident. Spider-shaped objects reported in Pennsylvania WHITEHALL — The witness and his mother saw two objects flying above Circuit City on Jan. 2,2002. The sun had just set at 5:00 PM when the witness' mother asked, \"What are those?\" At first they looked like dark planes flying parallel to each other with no lights. The witness says, \"I noticed the odd shape of the crafts. They were shaped like spiders, with a solid body in the middle and extensions from that in all directions. There were 4 or 5 extensions, and no sound was heard. There were no lights on the crafts, and they were very dark in color. The unusual shape scared us both, and I became fearful of terrorism by another country, and my mother ran into the store to get my dad. By the time they came out it was too far away to see.\" Thanks to NUFORC www.ufocenter.com. A Christmas Eve triangle in Ohio COLUMBUS — The witness was driving east on I- 70 late on Dec. 24,2001, when he saw a bright light hov- ering over the highway at 11:00 PM. As he drove closer, there were two lights 1500 to 2000 feet up, just sitting still. The witness states, \"While going past it, I lowered my window and heard no sound, but I could barely see the shape of a triangle.\" In the front, two lights were notice- able, one at one corner, and one at another. A third light was observed at the back (apex) that was much dimmer. The witness explains, \"It was not a helicopter, as I am an EMT. I had my CB radio on and didn't hear anyone else saying they saw it. Visibility was good and the sky was clear. It was about the size of my thumbnail.\" Lights in Wisconsin MARSHFffiLD/PITTSVILLE —A UFOWisconsin witness reports, \"My friend and his son were coming home from Marshfield on Jan. 9, 2002, and when they arrived they had told me that they had seen a lot of unidentifiable flashing lights in the sky and to go out on the roof and look.\" Two adults and two teenagers witnessed these lights from 7 to 7:45 PM. There were many small lights in the sky; each object seemed to have three colors red, yellow, green. There was no pattern to their travel, according to the witness. \"Some were moving very fast and then would stop and change direction rapidly. Others would be moving fast and then stop and the lights would dim very low. They were flying much too close to be aircraft flying at differ- ent heights and speeds.\" Thanks to UFOWisconsin.com http://www.ufowisconsin.com/county/reports/ r2002_0109_wood.html Flying triangle in Michigan WILLIAMSBURG — On Dec. 27, 2001, at 10:40 PM, the witness had been snow plowing and noticed \"an object in the sky with bright white lights and maybe 1 or 2 small red ones.\" When the witness got a 100 yards out, he stopped his vehicle to get a better look. The object was hovering and probably the size of a basketball court. The witness says, \"In no more than 5 seconds it went from a dead stand still to an abrupt fast sprint forward, February 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"and after a few seconds began to slow. I threw my truck in reverse and drove backwards somewhat parallel to the object.

Thanks to Peter Davenport, NUFORC UFO in Ohio photo? SALEM — My sister was taking photos of a new pond that was constructed on my brother's property on Dec. 28, 2001, located 1.5 miles out of the Salem city limits. She didn't see anything at the time, but when she got the pictures back from being developed, a saucer shaped object could be seen in one of the photos. Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC Oklahoma object mistaken for fire MERRITT — Jim Hickman reports that on January 8, 2002, a UFO was seen by two teenagers, a brother and sister, who were returning home at 8:40 PM. They were traveling down Merritt Road south of the town when they noticed what appeared to be a barn fire ahead of them. As they approached within 1/2 mile they observed that it was actually an object behind the barn. It was bigger than the barn and was emitting a \"real bright\" white/yellow/orange flashing light, which appeared to move upwards from behind the barn. The object then turned sideways with blue and red flashing lights in three rows around the outer edge of the object. The UFO was under 1000 feet in altitude when if flew upward to a point near overhead and then dimmed before disappearing. No noise was heard, and the object was in sight for several minutes. No electrical interference was noted, and no missing time reported. The skies were clear. The witnesses then noticed more red and blue lights in the road ahead, exactly where the object had just been. This turned out to be an Oklahoma Highway Patrol car that had stopped a speeder. The officer didn't appear to have noticed the aerial object, which should have been in plain sight of the officer. A neighbor lady reports seeing the same object the night before.

There was a very bright moon visible in the clear sky when he saw a falling star. A few minutes later in the north sky about 30 degrees above horizon he saw a cigar-shaped object moving very slow, then stopping. The witness reports, \"Then it moved very fast across the sky, going up then down very fast and stopping again like it was looking for something. I used my gun scope to look at the craft. It was a very long way from me, but very long and bright silver.\" Thanks to NUFORC www.ufocenter.com An aerial display in Texas PASADENA — On New Year's Eve the witness was driving west when he saw an elaborate fireworks display. He reports, \"What I saw was a huge rectangular shaped object at least 300 yards long and 50 yards wide. It was vertical with several bright white lights inside a red rectangular outer rim. \"It was 350 feet in the air and probably over the city of Pearland, TX, which is about 10 miles from where I saw the object. It was incredibly beautiful in the cloudy sky, and I wish I could have observed it longer. I believe it was either a craft or a holograph. Even though it was New Year's Eve I had not been imbibing and was com- pletely sober. Although after witnessing the event I could have used a good stiff drink.\" Airline passenger sees object DALLAS — The witness was on an American Air- lines Flight 1566 on Dec. 31,2001, from Dallas to Wash- ington, DC. They took off at 2:15 PM and climbed above the clouds to 33,000 feet. To the northeast, the witness noticed a solid white round object flying several thousand feet lower, and thought it might be a bird or balloon. It seemed to hover or float. The witness stated, \"Eventually, it was directly in line with my window, but at the same distance away. I sur- mise that at 500 mph, we have caught up with it, and it has not moved. I didn't see it move at that point. The white object then flew west, was still for a moment, and then shot out in a diagonal on a northwesterly route and disappeared in seconds into the horizon.\" Thanks to Pe- ter Davenport, NUFORC, www.ufocenter.com Erratic lights in Texas PASADENA — On Jan. 7, 2002, the witness' wife and son were leaving a restaurant and noticed a group of lights in the sky. As they headed east on Spencer high- way towards La Porte, they watched three lights, and the highest \"faded\" a little and headed north rapidly, until they could not see it. The one on the south dropped lower and then \"shot\" south very fast and was gone at 7:15 PM. The middle one just hung there, moving only slightly to the left and right and up and down. It got brighter and then dimmer; it was yellowish in color with a hint of a red and blue shimmer. The wife suggested that it might be a helicopter with a searchlight. The witness reports there were 13 or more aircraft converging towards the light near La Porte field, which only caters to personal aircraft.

I thought it was especially nice to see articles from two different people represent- ing two ends of the spectrum of opinion about how UFO studies should be pursued—Barry Downing and Jenny Randies. I find myself highly sympathetic to Randies' position, though at one time I was not nearly as interested in the \"nuts and bolts\" end of things. It was only when I went back to learn the history of the modern UFO debate that the importance of the nuts and bolts approach impressed itself upon me.  .  . However, since my degree is in religious studies, I also have a great deal of sympathy for Barry Downing's posi- tion-with qualifications. I thought his point about ufology not being able to compete with the government on the issue of the physical nature of UFOs-if the government has such artifacts-and that the field could instead make valuable contributions to the more non-material aspects of UFO events was well put. (Of course, the \"if clause in that sentence is a mighty big \"if.\") It is clear, however, that Downing is thinking from within a very Christian framework when he offers his God Hypothesis of UFO phenomena. He offers only two choices: (1) that UFOs are true manifestations of the di- vine or (2) that UFOs are merely playing God and hence, in essence, demonic. Downing opts for the first choice, suggesting that to understand the alien mind is to in some way understand the mind of God, and that, conversely, to understand the mind of God is in some way to understand what the aliens are up to-as in his \"Rock of Ages\" principle. I would suggest that there is at least one more possibil- ity. Perhaps the aliens are other life forms that have evolved (or existed) concurrently with the human species on this planet more or less from the beginning. They are not any more or less a manifestation of the divine than is the human species. Perhaps our less technologically advanced forebears, when they chanced to encounter these life forms, attrib- uted to them divine or quasi-divine attributes, which we see reflected in the religious stories and teachings of many world traditions-including the Judeo-Christian tradition. To read Moses' encounter with Yahweh on Mt. Sinai (Downing's Rock of Ages event) as an encounter with anything other than one of these very un-divine life forms may be quite mistaken. Perhaps to know the mind of God it is not so much necessary to know the alien mind or to understand the Bible, as it is necessary to be able to find and appreciate the solid core of the divine revealing itself in the world's religious wisdom and in the world-indeed, the universe itself. That aliens would be a part of such a universe should go without saying. That they should have an extra special February 2002 relationship to the divine, which Downing implies, and that we should approach any encounters with them with that presupposition in mind, is to commit the same logical er- ror that I suggest our ancestors may have made. It is the same way of thinking that may have given rise to many of our religious traditions in the first place. So why do the many religious traditions indicate that these life forms have claimed to be God, if they are not God? Doesn't that make them God-imposters and thus more or less demonic, as Downing suggests? Not neces- sarily. My cousin lost his mother when he was three years old. When he was five or six, he came to live with us for awhile, and he fell into calling my mother \"Mom\" while he was with us. She didn't correct him all the time, but simply let it be. Similarly, that's one reason these life forms might have identified themselves as \"God\"—because it was the identity our ancestors gave them, even if errone- ously. They became \"god\" to us-only understandable to us as gods because of our own level of development at the time. In addition, it could be that these life forms individually exhibit character traits and degrees of what we would call moral rectitude that are not that different from what human beings exhibit. (Zoologists are certainly finding that animals are more human-like in many of their traits than we have often given them credit for. If it's that way for species that are \"below\" us on the evolutionary ladder, why should it not be more or less the same for species \"above\" us?) If there were the occasional \"bad egg\" among them who gleefully took on the role of \"god\" with a willful in- tent to deceive, that would not mean that the entire race is therefore demonic in nature, as Downing suggests in one version of his God Hypothesis. They may in fact be neither particular manifestations of the divine nor demonic, but simply creatures more or less like ourselves. Finally, I would like to point out that my alternative theory of the relationship of possible alien races to the divine (the true, ultimate Divine) allows for the idea that there is not necessarily just one alien \"mind\" that human beings might need to come to understand. If the reports of experiencers are to be believed, there are a myriad of species or races of non-human beings showing an inter- est in us. Their rationales and methods might be very diverse. There may be no single \"alien mind\" to understand. Nei- ther version of Downing's God Hypothesis seems to al- low for this possibility. The beauty of Downing's approach is that it attempts to make the UFO phenomenon make sense within a main- stream Christian context, and it short-circuits the conser- vative Christian tendency to see encounters with non-human, non-physical intelligences as run-ins with the demonic. The problem with his approach is that it simply takes the exact opposite point of view-that encounters are manifestations of the divine in a very special way. I think this is probably a bit facile. As for me, if an alien shows up in my bedroom one night, I will try to approach it as I would when meeting a MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"new neighbor for the first time. I won't necessarily think he's a fiend, nor will I burden him with my expectations that he be a friend. He is simply a neighbor. Only- when we have gotten to know each other better will I be able to figure out the nature of our relationship. Perhaps\" we will only have a nodding relationship. Per- haps we -will become closer. I may find guidance on how to conduct myself in getting to know him if I apply the lessons and wisdom from my religious tradition. I may find the divine reflected in his life story or his actions or his own wisdom. But for these things he would deserve my respect, my admiration, my affection even. He would not deserve my adoration as a modern-day in- carnation (or expression) of the divine-at least not any more so than Rev. Downing himself, or you, Mr. Connelly, or any of the other members of MUFON. -Brenda Denzler, Ph.D. \"Divine\" has different meanings In Barry Downing's \"Wormholes, Heaven and the God Hypothesis, Part II,\" I believe he has come quite a way towards a plausible view.of UFO aliens. He set forth two alternatives: (1) the \"God Hypothesis,\", which Joe Lewels has also written about, and (2) \"ETs playing God.\" Downing's interpretation of (1) is that UFOs are a di- vine manifestation, and that their occupants perhaps even created the universe. However, \"divine\" can have differ- ent meanings and interpretations, and deserves some dis- cussion. For one, \"divine\" can imply that the aliens are gods or are godly. But those entities who long ago became known as gods and goddesses no doubt were aliens or extrater- restrials, for whom a special name was needed due to their very special, miraculous seeming, capabilities- \"gods\" in the English language. So this interpretation just brings us around in a circle. If \"divine\" is instead interpreted as pertaining to God, well, the Judeo-Christian God is Yahweh, who could fly around in his sky chariot; appear within a burning bush that didn't bum; walk along with Abraham, accompanied at first by two other men who were later identified as angels; appear as a man to Jacob and wrestle with him; send numerous messages, probably telepathically, to the prophets, telling them what to do; encourage and lead Joshua and his army to victory over many foes, etc. This entity, then, also was but a god, not God, though an important god who didn't want any other gods before him. He has merely become interpreted religiously as being God, as monotheism gradually displaced paganism and henotheism. Consider another god, the god of the Moabites, whose land was just east of the Dead Sea. For them this god was God, whom they called Kemosh or Chemosh, who, like Yahweh, was also actively involved in the affairs of his people. Again and again Kemosh sent the king of Moab and his army out to do battle, as did Yahweh of the Isra- elites (e.g., see Biblical Archaeological Review, Jan./ Feb. 2002, p. 45). Like, Yahweh, Kemosh had feelings that seemedao range at various times from gladness to displeasure for his people. The Israelites referred to Kemosh as the \"abomination of Moab\" (1 Kings 11:7, 2 Kings 23:13), though Solomon paid him some respect. Eventually the Israeli god/God became dominant in that region, and was later incorporated into Christianity. So the \"Godly\" inter- pretation of \"divine\" still leads to circular reasoning. Further,-why would the God of the universe spend so much time with humans in one comer of the Earth, when there are billions of other galaxies he or she is supposed to be attending to, each with hundreds of billions of stars, many of which have their own planets? Downing's second alternative (ETs playing God) cer- tainly seems to have been the case for the Israelites, Moabites, and others. However, we need not assume this always to have been the case with every ET or group of ETs that have contacted humans. All an ET needs to do is utilize his/her existing advanced technology in front of humans and he/she stands a good chance of being called a \"god,\" whether or not deliberately trying to amaze us. There are many instances on record where ET/UFO encounters have produced healings of people's ailments, and these could also give cause to call them gods. There are at least as many instances in which they have caused injury, and certainly trauma in the case of abductions, and these could give cause to call them demons. Together, the mixture might be cluing us not to refer to them as either. The alternative I miss from Downing's article is that aliens, many thousands, if not millions, of years advanced over us in physics- technology, psychic ability, and areas of inquiry we don't even yet know about, would indeed be able to utilize mental telepathy, make use of other di- mensions, and interact with humans even while the latter are \"out of their bodies.\" Presumably these aliens were once at a level of evolu- tion comparable to us now. This possibility was rejected by Lewels in his book, The God Hypothesis, but not con- vincingly in my opinion. Instead, the human mind seems incapable of imagining the advances in technology that a millennium of continued evolutionary progress could bring, •let alone hundreds of millennia. -Jim Deardorff Keeping an open mind is important Hurrah for Jenny Randies for writing one of the most logical and valid articles I have read in the Journal for quite some time. (View from Britain, MUFON UFO Journal, November, 2001). Her appreciation of the sci- entific method is apparent in her approach to understand- ing a phenomenon that is not yet understood at all. In a letter that I wrote almost a year ago, and which for some reason was not published, I suggested that MUFON follow its own stated mission of \"learning the origin and nature of the UFO phenomenon.\" I suggested that the scientific method, which we supposedly adhere to, dictates that as an organization we keep an open mind 1 Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal February 2002"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"regarding the nature of the problem until all of the facts are in. Arriving at a conclusion before that time is certainly antiscientific. I further suggested that this attitude of sci- entific open-mindedness should be reflected in the state- ments and writing of the officers and directors of the or- ganization. Although I believe that the ET theory fit's the reported facts best at the present time, it does not fit all of the facts, and I strongly agree with Ms. Randies' statement that \"... you did not have to assume that aliens were coming in order to accept the reality of unexplained UFO sightings.\" She goes on to state that the acceptance of this single hypothesis \"... has acted as a roadblock to progress.\" I feel that this, too, is all too true. In closing, I reiterate my plea for strict adherence to scientific principles, to open-mindedness, and to objective research until a final proof finally is reached. In closing I would like to thank the officers and direc- tors of MUFON for a job well done in behalf of the mem- bership. I recognize the severe problems they face in run- ning an organization like ours and want them to know that their work is appreciated and that this letter is meant to be constructive. -Saul H.

Applause to Stan Friedman for his \"maiden voyage\" as a Journal columnist! -Karl Pflock Pflock's account disputed Karl Pflock has it all wrong (Review of his book, Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe, in the October Journal, and his reply to the review in the December, 2001, MUFON Forum). First, he claims that the tape with \"flowered\" or \"hi- eroglyphic\" symbols is shown in the Ramey office photo- graphs. Pflock is the first among myriad students of these photographs to make such a claim. All others see only the white paper backing of the foil-laminate. This is folded over and glued, exactly per the radar target engineering drawings and construction specifica- tions. The result is a solid white seam about one-inch wide. The exceptionally well-focused photos show these seams unambiguously. At no point in the photos do the seams glare or change albedo-as they would were they the cellophane tape claimed by Pflock. Irregularly-shaped pieces of the same white paper can be seen throughout the debris, not only on the edges. Where the paper is torn, so is the \"tape,\" which is not the way \"Scotch\" tape deforms when torn. Skeptic Kent Jeffrey, after studying the photographs and relying on interviews with Army meteorologist Irving Newton, who identified the debris for the press in Ramey's office, concluded that the tape had withered in the desert heat and blown away before the target had been found. Second, Pflock wants us to believe that more than one radar target is on the floor. This is necessary in order to make the Ramey debris conform to the Mogul debris, which would consist of three targets. Sorry, the photo- graphs tell us otherwise. The Air Force Roswell report (Weaver Appendix 33) shows meticulously precise measurements of the debris furnished by a Department of Defense photo analyst. Although there should be no less than 37.5 feet of balsa stiffener rods, only 15.4 feet were found in the photo- graph. The surface area of a single reflector is 18 square feet. Only about one-half to two-thirds that amount appears in the photos. Indeed, someone has gone to great trouble to make that single reflector, or the fragments of one, seem as large as possible. It has been deliberately flattened and deformed. Dragging over the desert floor, as would a Mogul radar target in a. natural setting, would never produce the thoroughly flattened effect shown in the pho- tographs. Moreover, General Ramey spoke of a single target/ reflector. And Irving Newton still calls it a single reflec- tor. It is amazing that Pflock continues to fly in the face of the unarguable photographic and documentary evi- dence. Similarly absent is any evidence for Colonel Blanchard being a \"loose cannon.\" In his book Pflock presents only two quotes attributed to Blanchard regarding Roswell. Blanchard's wife: \"[he at first] thought it might be Rus- sian because of the strange symbols on it. Later on, he realized it wasn't Russian, either.\" And Blanchard's close friend Arthur McQuiddy quotes him as follows: \"The stuff I saw, I've never seen anyplace else in my life.\" Does this sound like a bellicose \"loose cannon\"? Rather, these are sober, carefully framed statements made by a thoughtful and deeply puzzled man to his most inti- mate associates. (Blanchard went on to become a four-star general, second in command of the U.S. Air Force. He died of a sudden heart attack in his Pentagon office, leaving no further hint of what so confused and unnerved him at Roswell in July 1947.) -Robert Durant February 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Different Child © 2001 by Sandy Nichols, Print, P.O. Box 1862, Merrimack, NH 03054, 209 Pages, $16.00 + s/h. Reviewed by Katharina Wilson \"He wondered if he were 'crazy,' he wondered if he was just making it all up, he wondered if his fascination with UFOs had influenced his thinking, and he wondered if he would ever find peace,\" writes Patricia McCormack Kerr, M.A., a licensed professional counselor iq the Foreword for Different Child. Pat McCormack worked with Sandy Nichols in order to help him try to make sense of the strange memories and recurring dreams he was dealing with. She states, \"Because we are still working to- ward his healing, and at the same time continuing to uncover information, I am continuing to keep most thoughts to myself. What I am willing to share at this time is that his experience appears to be genuine in regard to effect and consistency.\" As I read Different Child, I found Sandy Nichols to be a sensitive, sincere and apparently honest individual who deeply wants to understand what has happened to himself. And, because he also wanted to help others. Sandy started Alien Research Group (ARG) in 1998 and, with a close network of friends, helps people who believe they have had abduction experiences find counseling and sup- port groups. One of the many interesting things about this book that I immediately noticed was its beautiful cover. The art- work and the title tie in together with the abduction phe- nomenon in a way that touched me deeply, and I believe it will have the same effect on others. Sandy keeps a journal, and, like many abductees, he states that by periodically reading his journal, he is able to remember small, but important details that he originally thought were inconsequential when he wrote the events in his journal. After reviewing his journal from time to time, some of the details now appear to hold a deeper meaning than before. He views his abductions as some- thing that occurs against his free will, and, for the present, he does not feel that abductions are for the good of the abductee. Each chapter in Different Child has a quote beneath the name that gives the reader a hint as to what the chap- ter will be about. There is also poetry in this book written by Sandy and other abductees, like Michelle Guerin. Inci- dentally, Sandy has actually had several of his poems pur- chased by publishers, which attests to his writing abilities. While fighting the idea that abductions were really oc- curring to him, he also tried to prove to himself that he was not \"doing this to himself as debunkers incorrectly believe. He wore gloves to bed at night to prevent the cuts, scrapes and scratches from occurring. He hung Christmas bells on his door to awaken himself in case he was sleepwalking. He set his alarm clock at one-hour intervals to prevent strange dreams from invading his sleep. but nothing seemed to change things. He still found him- self in strange places, he still awakened with cuts and bruises, and he still had the strange memories. Sandy then asked his doctor to conduct a physical ex- amination to determine if he had weak blood vessels in his nose to account for nosebleeds, and to examine his skin to determine if he bruised more easily than most people did. Nothing seemed to explain his memories or cuts and bruises except for the fact that unusual things were in- deed happening to him and the possibility of abduction by unknown beings became a distinct possibility. Another thing that touched me early on in this book was reading something that my mother said to me a long time ago and finding out that Sandy's mother said the same thing to him: '\"You have always been my different child,' shaking her head as [my mother] slowly turned around and walked down the hallway toward the other end of the house. I could read her thoughts as easily as I had heard her words, and they sent a chill cascading through my entire body. For the first time in my life, my mother had verified the way that I had felt for a long time. With the challenge that parents face in shaping and molding their children for life's journey, I was a piece of the puzzle that did not quite fit.\" Sandy shares his feelings that deal with the difficulty of low self-esteem, which many abductees experience because of their abduction encounters. There are the fa- miliar feelings of failure and the difficulty of living in two separate, but coexisting, worlds: one is the \"status quo\" world, and the other is a \"secret\" world that is not sup- posed to exist. One of the consistencies about all abductees, no mat- ter how they view their experiences, is the fact that they all appear to go through an Awakening. Sandy's Awak- ening revolved around having three different dreams on the same exact days of the month for four-and-a-half years with all three dreams involving strange dancing lights. Sandy navigates his way through his Awakening and finds support from his wife and two couples he met at Shoreline Park near Gulf Breeze, FL. He finally breaks his silence and shares his \"terrible secret\" with the Morrisons and the Pollocks of the Gulf Breeze Research Team, four people who listened when no one else would or could. Sandy describes meeting them, \"It was like reuniting with lost family members or long forgotten friends who had my best interest at heart. The kindness they showed me was unlike anything else I had ever felt from strang- ers.\" Speaking from experience, I know that the Morrisons, Pollocks, and other members of GBRT have been listen- Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal February 2002"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ing to and trying to help abductees for many, many years, and I commend them for their kindness and effort. Different Child also contains a list of 58 possible \"in- dicators\" to help an individual determine if he or she might be an abductee. To his credit. Sandy does state that ev- eryone has at one time or another experienced some of the indicators on his list, and they do not necessarily prove you are an abductee. The indicators are really only guide- lines that may indicate the \"possibility\" of being an abductee. I also found Sandy's description of his interaction with the beings excellently articulated when he states \"...the beings actually merge with my conscious and unconscious thoughts. With this merging it is almost as if they can read my thoughts before I even think them.\" It would not be a fair and unbiased review if I did not mention the fact that this book has several editing mis- takes, but Sandy is a good writer, and they can be easily overlooked because of his interesting case, good descrip- tions, clarity, and sincerity. Different Child is packed with information, including a substantial listing of helpful Web sites and a list of Sandy's favorite books. I also came across new abduction-related information I had not read about before which I hope everyone will find as interesting as I found it to be. After Sandy's persona! story ends, he shares with us several submissions from other abductees, and these expose the reader to additional fascinating and very touching encoun- ters with extraterrestrial and interdimensional beings. These submissions are exceptionally interesting and are left unedited so you feel the nuances from each individual personality sharing their encounter. Sandy Nichols boldly shares his abduction experiences with us for the first time, and I believe his story and the submissions from several other abductees he has faith in are honest and sincere representations of what is occur- ring to many people on our planet. There are similarities to other cases, but Sandy is a unique individual, and as with all abductions and abductees, each case and each person is special and has something new to teach us. Dif- ferent Child will teach you something new, and I believe you will find Sandy Nichols' journey a very interesting one!

Methanogens may be key to life on other planets Meet the methanogen, a tiny organism living in com- plete darkness 660 feet (200 meters) underneath the sur- face of Idaho. Researchers report the discovery of a com- munity of various organisms dominated and supported by these methanogens, creatures they say could represent just the sort of life to look for when turning over rocks on Mars. The work, along with an- other recent report of life found in extreme conditions in Antarctica, adds to mount- ing evidence for life's tenac- ity and creativity, fueling in- creased speculation about the prospects for life on other Derefc Lovk worlds. Unlike other organisms at the bottom of the food chain, methanogens need little of the traditional sustenance that biologists associate with life. They get by without oxygen and no help from sunlight, said the U.S. Geological Survey's Francis H. Chapelle, who led the study along with Derek Lovley of the University of Massachusetts. Methanogens simply feed off hydrogen in the rocks around an underground hot spring. No one knew if life could live in such conditions. So the Idaho site was cho- sen for its lack of organic matter, stuff that is originally produced by sunlight-powered organisms and is known to support other subsurface ecosystems. \"This kind of microbial community has never been found on Earth,\" Chapelle told SPACE.com, adding that it \"may be representative of the kinds of life that initially evolved on the early Earth, and which may presently occur on Mars or Europa.\" Methanogens belong to an ancient group related to bacteria, called the archaea. All archaea are outfitted for survival in extreme environments. They are thought to have dominated primitive Earth, when oxygen was rare. Places considered most likely to harbor extraterres- trial life-pockets of underground water on Mars or an ocean under the frozen crust of Jupiter's moon Europa- are only presumed to exist, and since they exist below the surface and get no sunlight, any life there would have to have an alternative means of fuel. The new finding shows that the recipe for life is sim- pler than previously thought, that sunlight is not needed. That improves the prospects for finding ET, researchers said. \"Hydrogen may well be an important requirement for extraterrestrial life,\" Chapelle said. And hydrogen is ev- erywhere. It's the most abundant element in the universe. Importantly, preliminary data recently sent back by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft suggests there may be a wealth of hydrogen within 3 feet (1 meter) of the surface of Mars.

And the consequences of the latest developments must cause us to consider the role that all government departments adopt when it comes to UFO investigation. Why do the powers that be investigate UFOs? Be- cause they think an alien presence is monitoring us?, I doubt it (although in the early days that probably was viewed as a real possibility). Because they-see a threat to. the nation from these encoun- ters? Probably not in the sense that you expect. Because they want to find the answers to a baffling mys- tery out of altruism or a spirit of adventure? An altruistic defence agency is a contradic- tion in terms. No, in truth, it has always been hard to de- fine just why defence agencies still find UFOs so irresistible. However, insights are com- ing, as in the summer of 2001 the MoD began to make good . on its long stated promise to release its records. This came as a prelude to an inevitable \"Freedom of Information Act\" in the UK, but still (as of early 2002) not in clear sight. Not only did this involve a liberalisation of the se- crecy restrictions once in force, but practical demonstra- tions of the new-found willingness for \"Open Govern- ment,\" as Tony Blair calls it. In the past, government records on UFO study were released to the Public Record Office (PRO) in Kew, Lon- don, where they could be studied at leisure-but only after 30 years had elapsed since the last action was taken on them. So UFOlogists got used to an annual jamboree come New Year's Day and looking at the latest \"time capsule\" as files from a long forgotten age were released to scru- tiny. Indeed, the media often feature stories in and around this period reflecting on the latest revelations from cabi- net minutes that are also released to the PRO from an- other age in this same ritualistic manner. The change in emphasis as 2001 progressed saw not only the decision to release lots of older documents, but also some more recent ones for which the 30 years were far from concluded. The most dramatic example of the former was the release of an early study into UFOs car- ried out by Air Ministry advisers, and which formed the basis of a briefing to then Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1952. This was in the summer of both the Washington, DC, \"wave\" and the Operation Mainbrace incidents when a NATO exercise in Britain was invaded by several high profile UFO sightings. We have long known that Churchill demanded answers from his air minister for this aerial activity (the memo proving this was released about 12 years ago), but had not seen the report that he was presumably given. The MoD decision to release this (to UFOlogists David Clarke and Andy Roberts, who had been on its trail for some time) was a sign of the big changes. As was the stunning release of the 150-page case file depicting the MoD's attempts to investigate the famous Rendlesham Forest case. As these incidents, well known as one of Britain's biggest cases, happened in late 1980, and the last actions on the MoD file are several years after that, by all normal procedures we should be waiting for release of the Rendlesham file until well into the next decade. Position statement: So times have c runged but what have these dramatic revelations told us aboul Bntish government UFO inves- tigation? They reflect the position statement that they have trot- ted out year in, year out, since I have been an active UFOlogist. Write to the department charged with respon- sibility (an Air Staff division run by civil service clerical officers-of which the most famous is Nick Pope, who was at this office between 1991 and 1994), and they would have a reply ready to send out that has been barely al- tered for decades. If you asked why the MoD investigated UFOs they would tell you that they did so in order to establish whether these sightings had any defence implications. Although they could not presume that no case ever would, they were satisfied that there were prosaic explanations'for the vast majority of the reports, and no case that they had seen had offered defence implications. How you reacted to this claim probably depended upon your own views about UFOs. On the one hand it sounds very reasonable. After all, we do know that 95% of all UFO sightings are really IFOs, and so no conceivable defence threat. Equally, even with the puzzling cases, evidence of any overt hostility or defence implication in a \"war of the worlds\" sense is virtually nil. Real UFOs could be many different things that we haven't fully understood yet, but there is no real grounds to suggest that they are an alien invasion force. If they were, likely by now the earth would be a pile of rubble drifting through space. Defence implications: On the other hand, if you think more deeply about this comment, things start to look more curious. That term \"defence implications\" surely has a broader meaning than exposing an alien threat. For instance, what if some UFOs are a type of atmospheric energy that can interfere with sophisticated computer controls and potentially cause air- craft to malfunction. There is at least a possibility of this. Page 20 MUFON UFO Journal February 2002"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Would it not be regarded as a matter of defence signifi- cance to find out the causes, and try to eliminate them, especially if multi million pound aircraft that might be used to defend the country were experiencing such difficulties when confronting these UFOs? Equally, what if there were things that you could learn from studying UFO data that offered you militaristic ad- vantages? For instance, if some UFOs (as I believe) are really extreme forms of ball lightning, then understanding these cases could provide advances in plasma physics and new propulsion methods. These would inevitably be subject to covert research, since you would be interested in getting an advantage over your enemies-and the best way to do that would not be to openly admit what you think some UFOs might be. But defence implications behind a few UFO cases would, in that respect, clearly exist. The suspicion has to be that the MoD (and, of course, by inference government agencies all over the planet) have not maintained UFO monitor departments for no reason. If there really never has been a single case over 50 years that has defence implications, then the point of expending finance to keep that UFO monitor in business seems hard to grasp. One assumes that it was maintained because there was a realistic chance that new things were being discovered. Otherwise why bother? End Game: Interestingly, in November 2001 (although many me- dia sources did not pick up on this until early 2002) the MoD tried to answer this question. The Blair government was faced with crumbling public services. Hospital pa- tients were being shipped off to France and Germany to relieve massive waiting lists on the cash strapped Na- tional Health Service. Schools were crying out for more money. And the rail system in a country that had invented this mode of transport was proven to be the slowest, least funded and most expensive in modern Europe, needing billions of pounds to revive its fortunes. Now that the MoD had released its records, appar- ently showing that they knew 50 years ago that most UFO sightings were explicable, claiming no evidence that any were alien, and adamant that none had ever had any de- fence implications-the contradiction brought about by maintaining a UFO monitor was suddenly apparent. UFOlogists, of course, had been saying this for years, but they don't matter in the scheme of things. Now that these facts were available to all-including the opposition party and investigative journalists-the dangers were all too evident. Someone would sooner or later point out the political folly of chasing apparently unimportant lights in the sky at the taxpayers' expense whilst schools, hospi- tals, and trains fell to pieces for lack of money. The result was predictable. The MoD announced that they had decided to shut up shop and close their UFO department altogether. In a move only 32 years behind the USA and its Project Blue Book, the MoD explained that it was now felt unneccesary, as nothing of defence implications had emerged. Life after death: Of course, as in the US, reports of the death of British government interest in UFOs have been exagerrated. The civil service unit of the Air Staff always was a bit of a public show to reassure folk that something was being done-although that rarely extended beyond taking a few phone calls, shuffling a few papers, and writing the odd letter. It certainly was not in the same league as Captain Ruppelt jetting off to a landing site and spending three days interviewing eyewitnesses. It was a public relations exercise, never an active UFO investigation department. The stunning ineptitude with which the Air Staff handled the Rendlesham Forest landings in early 1981 is proof of this. After all, if you receive a report from a senior USAF officer, endorsed by the British squadron leader whom you have sent to watch over the base, and that report claims that a UFO flattened a hole in some trees, left marks on the ground, and radiation levels considered un- usual-all in aparkused by picknickers and local villagers to walk their dogs-what do you do? Do you close off the forest under some pretext right away, and rapidly establish whether there is any threat from this radiation before reopening it, and then carefully establish what was or was not witnessed? If you are se- riously investigating UFOs or concerned about potential defence implications, of course you do. But the MoD did no such thing. They had no idea what had happened (and months later admit as much in this report). They also waited weeks, then wrote a memo to ask if any other intelligence agency was interested in fol- lowing up these claims of excess radiation. They admit- ted that the radiation levels looked a bit high, but did not establish how high with any haste. And two months later (by which point half of East Anglia could have had radiation poisoning!) did they even wake up. In this case such lethargy was justified. The radiation levels were probably not dangerous. But the lackadaisical manner in which any follow up proceeded indicates that the Air Staff lost any right to be considered serious about UFOs long before they shut up shop. They could have been wrong with terrible consequences. Of course, as in the US, other departments will be maintaining a watching brief. There have always been shady associations from defence intelligence units and scientific and technical analysts. The MoD data reveals this, but rarely the nature of their deliberations, and as yet their files are not open to the new liberal policies. Who knows if they ever will be opened up, and my bet is that they are where the more interesting research, in- vestigation, analysis, and commentary did go on, and still goes on. Closing down the Air Ministry UFO staff gets the media off their back and makes the British govern- ment seem to be moving with the times into a new era where it must account for all expenditure and not waste precious funds on things that they publicly insist are of no consequence. But this is really just another MoD spin that will likely (Continued on page 23) February 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"••___ ^,.-:--~ :^N \\ Perceptions -'-.-.  By Stanton T. Friedman Stanton T. Friedman Academia and UFOs I have had an unusually good opportunity to observe the reaction of the academic community to UFOs, having lectured on the topic \"Flying Saucers ARE Real\" at more than 600 colleges and over 100 professional groups, such as management clubs, in all 50 states and 9 Provinces. Not only has there always been a question and answer session after each lecture,' but there have been classroom visits and seminars. Sometimes I was lold to be sure to leave time at the end of a colloquium for commentary. Clearly, they thought they could show that this UFO'stuff was all nonsense. I made sure that in those sessions, often en- titled \"Flying saucers and Phys- ics,\" that I touched on a number of technical topics about which I thought they would be ignorant: \"You are all familiar with the fu- sion and fission nuclear rockets, or electromagnetic submarines, or ' data on maximum acceptable ac- celeration, etc.? Are any of you aware of these?\" Usu- ally none were. The point was that the students'could see that their profs really weren't with it. The best one prof could come up with was, \"How come you haven't published in any physics journals or given a paper at a meeting of the Ameri- can Physical Society?\" \"Didn't you see my letter in Physics Today! Besides, why give a lecture to 50 people at an APS meeting when I can talk to hundreds or thousands and get press cover- age to tens of thousands with my lectures?\" I was some- what relieved when that evening there was a packed house with people even sitting on the stage. 1 have generally found that while there have been a number of courageous academics such as Dr. David Jacobs, Dr. Alvin Lawson, and Dr. Ed Zeller, who have taught classes on UFOs, the general approach of the sci- ence profs has been negative. It seems to be based on a number of basic facts: ' -  • T. Arrogance: \"If these things were real, it would be important. If it was important, I would know about them. I don't, so they must not be real. Besides any so-called physicist without a PhD and working, God Forbid , in in- dustry, isn't worth listening to anyway.\" Before Dr. J. Allen Hynek would see me, back in the 1960s, he had an associate listen to my lecture at a col- lege in Chicago. Only if I passed muster would we go to Hynek. One of Allen's first questions was, \"Why didn't you get a Ph.D.?\" I told him I was tired of working my way through university as a union waiter, and wanted to get out in the real world. 2. Ignorance of the data. At tbe beginning of my lecture the focus is on five large-scale scientific studies of UFOs. After a brief review of each, I ask, \"How many have read a copy of this study?\" Typically it is less than 2%. If they were going to challenge me, I wanted the audience to know that they hadn't looked at the data. One physics prof started the question-answer session with a whole bunch of \"You said....\" Every one was a gross distortion of what I had said-for example, claiming I had said Betty and Barney Hill were taken to Zeta Reticuli and back in 2 hours!!! Somebody shouted, \"How about taking some sensible questions?\" The sceptic walked out. \"Who was that?\" A professor of physics. Obviously he hadn't heard what I said, as opposed to his notions of what a foolish believer would say. Rather surprising to many people, I have had fewer than 12 hecklers in over 700 lectures. Two were drunk. 3. Appeal to authority. Often academics have read maybe one sceptical book, such as by Donald Menzel of Harvard or heard the late Carl Sagan on TV or in Cos- mos, or have heard or read comments by writers such as Phil Klass. \"These people have shown there is nothing to flying saucers, so I need only echo then- views.\" Cer- tainly they don't feel they need to validate the explana- tions. 4. Irrational notions of what science is all about. Carl Sagan, during a meeting at his home, stressed repro- ducibility as the key. I wrote a long response pointing out that there are at least four kinds of science: A. The experiments in which everything is under the control of the experimenter, and in which the experiment can be repeated by the scientist and anybody else who reads his papers. B. Those measurements made in circumstances in which the scientist cannot control all the variables, but can predict certain crucial ones, such as the timing and location of eclipses. One cannot create eclipses on de- mand, and one cannot guarantee good weather at the lo- cation, but one can be well prepared to make scientific measurements when they occur. • C* Those situations in which one can neither control nor predict, but can be prepared when something of inter- est has happened. Earthquakes and solar storms are two examples. Seismographs are located in many places. Par- ticle detectors can signal that a solar storm has occurred. And finally, D. Those events or activities involving in- telligence. These might include murder, rape, aircraft or automobile accidents, or observations of flying saucers. It is the approach to data gathering and evaluation which must be scientific. One measures skid marks and blood alcohol levels, and listens to voice recorders. I can guarantee that more than 30,000 people will be killed in automobile accidents in the USA over the next 12 months, but I can't predict just when or where or who (Continued on next page, lower left) Page 22 MUFON UFO Journal February 2002"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"March 2002 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars (magnitude 1.4), in Aries, lies in the W at twi- light and then sets about 9:45 PM.

I quite agree that there may be nothing earth changing behind UFOs, and I support the MoD line that they are not a threat in any overt sense. They never were really the province of a department whose primary goal is the defence of the realm. UFOs are properly a scientific mystery that is best handled by people equipped to probe and analyse, not track and shoot down. So 1, for one, do not mourn the MoD announcement. I welcome it. But not for one minute do I believe that the Ministry are unaware of certain possible UFO ramifications for their own work, and I suspect the security cleared scientists and RAF intelligence opera- tives are as active as ever in keeping track of new data. They are also probably delighted to be doing so in an age where, as the MoD will no doubt now not tire of telling us, there is no official UFO investigation because the MoD closed this down in 2001 after it led nowhere. That is the line you will be seeing from the media in the months and years to come. But it would be wise not to simply take them at their word.
