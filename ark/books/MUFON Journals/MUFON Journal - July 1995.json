This question still remains central to the UFO debate. The dreamlike effects, ap- paritional features, and occult-like overtones of many UFOs are well-known in the literature. Some UFOs behave more like energy-forms or ghosts, producing unusual electromagnetic effects, seem- ingly entering and exiting our reality, and leaving only tantalizing traces without definitive concrete ev- idence of artificial, albeit advanced, construction. My book, Examining the Earthlight Theory (pub- lished by CUFOS). chronicles decades of UFO sightings on the Yakima Indian Reservation in Washington state. During my research for that book I came across a fam- ily who had a large number of unusual experiences to re- late. Frankly, I avoided including their experiences in the book because I wasn't certain whether they were entirely related to UFOs. And yet, as you will see, the family did observe UFOs during the time of their experiences and during the height of major UFO activity on the reserva- tion. The family's experiences raise the question again: Are UFOs something more complex, more puzzling, than spaceships from other planets? Are UFOs part of a much more intricate phenomenon, linked more to the hu- man mind than to simple concepts of extraterrestrial visitation? Here are the family's accounts and my at- tempt to explain them. Some of the accounts come from Bill Vogel's logs. Vogel was the resident reservation UFO investigator. Other accounts come from my six interviews with the Smith family (a pseudonym). I n the summer of 1972, while Bill Smith was talking long distance with his sister, Susan .(his wife) called his attention to a bright, round, white light about a quar- ter of a mile from the house to the east. Susan and the two children went outside to investi- gate, and Bill stood in the open doorway and watched the light, all the while describing what he saw into the phone. Suspended above the cornfields, the light was very large, and suddenly very blinding as it \"came on brilliant ... brighter than the sun ... startling...\" Bill squinted. The light remained brilliant for about 15 to 20 seconds, then dimmed back to its original brightness, and moved vertically upwards about 200 to 300 feet and stopped, glowed intensely brilliant, dimmed back to normal, and then turned sideways. As it did, the light re- vealed the object to which it was attached — a football- shaped or Zeppelin-like \"craft\" with blunt.ends. The two ends of- the craft appeared to be made of opaque glass. The end on the right glowed. The object was between 100 and 150 feet, or \"three boxcar lengths,\" long. Light from the setting sun re- vealed horizontal ''ribs\" and flat areas of \"cloth,\" as in old-fashioned airplanes, stretched from rib to rib. Bill could even see what he thought were several \"rivets\" on the cloth-like material. The three-dimensional craft was the color of oxidized lead, a dull gray, and reminded Bill of \"an old battleship... in the construction of it.\" Six to eight portholes giving off orange light ran along its length. The portholes were about 8 feet in diameter, and the widest portion of the craft was 30 feet. Bill could see that the soundless object had no aerodynamics to it—no fins, rudders, or undercarriage. During the sighting, Mary, Bill's daughter, became agitated. Standing in the open doorway, Bill knew he had a loaded Polaroid camera and a rifle. He thought that he could easily shoot the object, but then instantly had the mental sensation \"that we were under the sights\" of the UFO and that it would be very foolish to take hostile ac- tion. \"I got the distinct impression that there was intel- ligence aboard the thing,\" Bill said, taking no photos and never touching the rifle. Then the light on the right end came on—so brilliant that Bill could not look at it—and, slowly, at about 30 to 35 miles per hour, the object traveled to the northeast, over the cornfields, and vanished from sight. \"Whatever this thing was, it was there,\" Bill emphasized. January 17, 1975. Smith called Bill Vogel (8:30 p.m.) and reported that he was observing a large, bright light, much larger than an aircraft landing light, red-orange in the middle, yellow toward the edges, and whitish around the perimeter. The light was 15 to 18 miles north of Smith's location and below the top of a ridge. The light remained stationary for three to four minutes, then moved eastward for four or five miles, stopped, reversed direction, and then departed fairly rapidly toward the northwest. JULY 1995 NUMBER 327 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL On the morning of May 9, Bill noticed \"strange markings\" in the dust on the hoods and fenders of two passenger cars parked side by side near his house. Each marking was perfectly round and com- posed of a series of concentric circles. Vogel wrote: \"The first thought a person got upon looking at the tracks was that someone had walked around on the vehi- cles with a pair of crutches.\" About April 29, 1975. Bill and his family sighted (about 9:15 p.m.) a bright light coming from the north- east. The center of the light was red, the outside bound- ary yellow. The light was below the tops of the hills. Before the light reached Toppenish, it stopped, then turned due north a short distance, and then slanted off to the northwest and climbed until it disappeared in the clouds. As it climbed away, Bill observed the light through binoculars and saw two lights separated by darkness. He described the object to Vogel as oblong and huge. The front light on the object was fluorescent yel- low, the rear light a \"hard\" red glow like the light in the preceding case. The object was below the hills and de- parted toward the northwest. Night of May 8-9, 1976. On the morning of May 9, Bill noticed \"strange markings\" in the dust on the hoods and fenders of two passenger cars parked side by side near his house. Each marking was perfectly round and composed of a series of concentric circles. Vogel wrote: \"The first thought a person got upon looking at the tracks was that someone had walked around on the ve- hicles with a pair of crutches.\" The markings were scattered across the hood and windshield of one. vehicle; and up the side of the right fender, on the hood, the windshield, and the left fender of the second vehicle, including the left \"roof lip\" above the driver's door. One marking appeared on a large soft drink bottle on the ground next to the car closest to Smith's house. The markings measured from 3 and 1/2 inches to slightly larger than the eraser of a pencil. On many of the markings were several strands of what appeared to be dog hair. Tethered near the vehicles on the night of May 8-9 were Bill's two German shepherds, two excellent watch dogs who would always respond instantly to any intruder, animal or human. These dogs did not bark that night. Vogel speculates in his report that the strands of hair could have been from the dogs. The previous evening. May 8, Bill's daughter was awakened by what seemed to be a \"thud\" against the side of the house outside her bedroom, which was on the PAGE 4 east side of the house near the cars. A few seconds later she heard the sound of \"breaking glass, as if a large terrarium had been dropped on a side-walk...\" No broken glass or other out-of-place object was found the next morning. Vogel noted that on July 22, 1976 (over two months later), Bill heard someone walking on his front porch. Looking out the window in the door, he saw no one; the dogs in front of the porch were sleeping peacefully. Also, Vogel noted that \"last night\" (date unknown) Bill heard something \"bumping and moving around just out- side his'bedroom window.\" Checking, Bill saw nothing; again, the dogs were peacefully sleeping. Bill related to me an incident in which he heard foot- steps on the porch, and looked up in time to see the shadow of someone passing by on the porch (the shadow was observed through the closed louvers of the door window). He characterized the footsteps as those of a \"heavyset man.\"      '\" October 18, 1976. At 7:56 p.m., Bill and a ranch hand observed a round light, yellow inside and orange- red around the rim, moving southeasterly to northwest- erly at a distance of 1/2 mile near a ranch (south of Toppenish) where the two men were standing. The light, low in altitude, moved slowly and didn't flash, and dis- appeared behind a butte once it cleared the rim of a canyon. November 27, 1976. Bill discovered on a car in his driveway circular markings of the kind observed May 9, 1976, this time the size of a nickel, and scattered across the right front fender and half way across the hood of the vehicle. Strands of hair were clinging to a number of the markings. Vogel noted in his report that on the evening of November 27, 1976, he received reports of a strange \"beeping\" noise coming from the general area of the Smith residence. (This \"beeping\" noise was also re- ported September 1974 and February and April 1975.) In a report dated December 15, 1976, Vogel described a series of incidents that occurred weeks or months ear- lier. In these incidents, a No. 15 socket from a metric socket set vanished moments after Bill returned it to its set after he used it to adjust his motorcycle, Several days later Smith found it in the set although No. 22 was now missing. Sometime around mid-December 1976, the entire metric set disappeared. February 10, 1977. About 8:00 p.m., Bill and his family .observed a light south of Toppenish, moving east to west. The light was about 15 miles away and had a reddish-orange center surrounded by white light. The upper portion was emitting \"spike-like rays of white light.\" Across the bottom portion was a number of red lights. The light disappeared behind Toppenish Ridge.

RAINIER TO YAKIMA WHITE SWAN PUMP HOUSE ROAD it MILL CREEK GUARD STATION GRAYBACK MOUNTAIN LOOKOUT MABTON >»K TO PROSSER r SOPELIA TOGOLDENDALEl LOOKOUT 5 MILES B efore we continue, let us note the large number of lights that were observed by the Smiths — ten sightings in all. Four of the lights were reddish-orange in color. Additionally, the Smiths told me that they saw from their residence during late summer and fall in the early '70s, numerous reddish-orange lights along Toppenish Ridge. Through binoculars, the lights ap- peared as nothing but light (no object was ever seen), \"more red than orange.\" These lights appeared so often and so long that the Smiths were able to carry on their evening work, come in the house to eat, and then go out- side to watch the lights again. But what is more interesting are the other experi- ences reported by the Smiths. Were these other experi- ences, \"paranormal\" in nature, somehow related to the lights? The Smiths moved onto their property in 1966. The first paranormal experience occurred in September 1969. During the day, Susan heard the barking of two family dogs. Children passing by the house on bicycles would often taunt the dogs, so their barking was not unusual. However, the dogs seemed to be \"throwing a fit\" and had run to the end of the fence. Susan saw a boy with blue jeans, a royal blue shirt, and black hair and dark skin walking along the road (west to east). The boy appeared clean-cut and could have been Hispanic or an Indian. She watched the boy walk out of view as he passed be- hind the tree that bordered the road and grew on the perimeter of the yard. However, the boy did not pass be- yond the tree as he should have in order to continue down the road. The dogs began whining. After waiting awhile, Susan became concerned that the boy may have had a seizure and had fallen, and she ran out onto the road. The boy was gone. No obstructions existed near the tree (nor do they today) on the other side of the road, which the boy could have used for cover. That evening she reported the incident to her husband. The experience upset her enough that she ordered the tree cut down when the local electric company notified her that its branches required trimming. To this date, a stump re- mains where the tree had been. In 1970, the Smiths' son and daughter were 13 and 11, respectively. Bill's father died in March 1970, and this date, firmly etched in Susan's memory, served as a benchmark for her recollection of the first event. Following the \"disappearing boy\" incident of September 1969, it seemed that one strange occurrence followed an- other in an unending series. Incident 1. In February 1970, while Bill was at work in Toppenish and Susan was inside the house, a male friend, who had been digging up a septic line behind the house, came inside, acting \"funny.\" He said he had seen JULY 1995 NUMBER 327 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Bill was adjusting the points on his motor- cycle, which was positioned on the porch.

Suddenly, something tugged his collar sev- eral times in rapid succession. It was no dog, and Bill went directly into the house, somewhat shaken. a shadow approach him while he was digging in the ditch. According to Bill, \"He saw the shadow walk up. He could see the legs... an outline of legs standing... He could see the shadow of a body—of a man.\" The shadow approached the ditch several times during the day. \"Spooked,\" the friend quit the next day, leaving Bill to finish the job. A few days later, Bill was preparing to resume the in- terrupted project. While walking by the side of the house, he heard voices. Stopping at the comer, he listened to two male voices who were speaking extremely fast behind the house in an unknown \"guttural\" language that sounded German, Slavic or Indian. It was no language Bill recog- nized. The two distinct voices were apparently \"com- municating.\" Bill listened for a minute. The moment he stepped around the corner to discover who was there, the voices ceased; he saw no one. Later, when he went inside for coffee, he asked Susan if she had been playing the radio. She hadn't and as- sumed he had been talking to someone behind the house. Puzzled, both pinpointed the exact location of the voices based on where each had heard them. Incident 2. One evening Susan finished reading in bed, turned out the light, and closed her eyes. She then heard footsteps in the hallway and the sound of the front door opening and closing. She thought one .of her children had gone outside to retrieve a toy, but ten minutes passed, and no one returned. Thinking one of the children may have been sleepwalking, she looked in the bedroom. The children were asleep. Checking the front door, she found it locked. She opened the door and saw no one outside. Interesting was that the footsteps originated near the chil- dren's bedroom and had a light tread. Incident 3. Bill was adjusting the points on his motor- cycle, which was positioned on the porch. While bent over, something hit the collar of his wool jacket. Thinking it was the tail of his dog; he ignored the interruption, ad- justed his jacket, and continued his task. Suddenly, some- thing tugged his collar several times in rapid succession. It was no dog, and Bill went directly into the house, somewhat shaken. Incidents 4, 5 and 6. A can opener hanging on a hook on the kitchen wall fell off of its own accord. A knife jumped out of a frying pan and landed on the floor. One morning Bill came upon a red rosebud lying in the hall- way. The short-stemmed bud was just beginning to open. Although the Smiths had rose bushes, they had only yel- low and pink buds. Incident 7. At dusk. Bill and Susan came home after eating out, and as Bill opened the front door, he heard ''lit- tle girls' voices\" coming from down the hallway in Mary's room. The voices, normal and unalien in all re- spects, were \"laughing and giggling\" as in play. When he stepped over the threshold, the laughing voices instantly ceased. Incident 8. After arriving home from school, Mary was walking the dogs near the trees in the back yard. The dogs, for no apparent reason, suddenly began \"raising Cain.\" Out of nowhere, a woman's voice spoke: \"Shuush. Be quiet.\" Frightened, the girl immediately retreated with the dogs to the house where she remained until her parents arrived home. Incident 9. Early November 1979. Susan awoke in the middle of the night. The window was opened slightly to let in fresh air. She heard a young woman's voice from outside call her husband's name. The family dogs, teth- ered outside, and who served as excellent guards, never barked. Significantly, the voice used her husband's formal name, which few people outside the family knew. Incident 10. Bill was a very deep sleeper, unlike Susan, who slept lightly. That anything should wake Bill at all was unusual in itself. He awoke late one night and heard Remaining tree stump. (See page 5. > Photo by Greg Long. PAGE 6 NUMBER 327 JULY 1995"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL a male voice outside the window to his left, situated next to Susan's side of the bed. The voice was \"fantastically clear,\" Bill told me, \"with the most beautiful enunciation I have ever heard.\" The voice was describing the location of the sleeping inhabi- tants in the house: '\"There is a woman and a man (Susan and Bill). There's a hallway, a bathroom. Down the hallway is a small bedroom. There are two small boys in it (Todd Smith and a friend staying overnight). There's a living room. And there's a small girl (Mary) in the far end.'\" The \"man\" had perfect modulation and tone. What was most peculiar was that he described the sleeping bodies as if he were inside the house looking down. Bill woke up Susan. \"Did you hear that voice?\" he asked. The voice then ceased. Bill went to the bathroom, returned to bed, turned over on his side, and faced the hall- way. Just as he was about to fall asleep, the voice began anew, this time next to a side door of the house. \"He is continuing to describe the house in the same beautiful male voice—perfect modulation, perfect enunciation... This time, Susan heard it.\" However, the moment Bill got out of bed to investigate, the voice stopped. Bill cranked open the louvers in the door. Moonlight illuminated the yard; the dogs were sleeping. Bill recalled that the voice was of someone in his 30s, and he seemed to be reporting his observations \"over a ra- dio... like he was reporting from this location to someone else.\" Interestingly, the voice did not describe the kitchen but jumped to the far bedroom where the little girl slept. Bill stated: \"To me, it was not a man. There was no person there, or those dogs would have been raising nine kinds of hell.\" I studied the location of the windows of the home from the outside. It would not have been impossible for a person to have looked through the windows. However, why stand outside a window and awaken the inhabitants? If to create a hoax, the hoaxer was risking his life since Bill would have readily used a gun to protect his family. Also, the dogs made no sound. This lack of reaction from the dogs is a strange, continuing pattern. Incident 11. While sitting on the porch with Todd's best friend, Bill and the boy heard whistling coming from a distance toward some shrubs beyond the driveway. When they focused their attention on the whistling, the whistling stopped. Resuming their conversation, the whistling began again. The boy asked: \"Who is that?\" Bill directed the boy to go see. Checking the shrubs and road, the boy found no one. Bill remembered the whistle as having three notes with different tones. Incident 12. At 5:30 one morning, Susan stepped out- side to pick up the paper. Snow was on the ground. Normally, the dog would come out from under the truck, which served as shelter, to greet her. This time he didn't. She whistled for him. Immediately she heard a \"long, high-pitched\" whistle several seconds in duration come from the direction of a bridge that runs over a north- south irrigation ditch not far from the house. The dog be- gan whining. Susan ran into the house and woke up Bill. The bridge is on the other side of the house from where she stood, and no one would have been visible to her. Susan said the whistle sounded human. Incident 13. Bill, Susan and Mary were sitting to- gether on the sofa watching television one evening when Bill heard a \"beeping\" sound having the electronic musi- cal tone characteristic of digital-dial telephones. The beeping was within 3 feet of him, situated near the wall to his left. This wall separates the living room from the environ- ment outside. The beeping faded away. Wondering if he had heard the telephone, Bill lifted the receiver but heard nothing unusual. He asked Susan and Mary if they had heard the sound; they had not, but they soon did when the beeping began again but then ceased within a few sec- onds. (Vogel told me that the family cat, which had been behind the TV, retreated, fur raised, under a bed and re- fused to come out for two days.) Incident 14. A few nights later, Bill was lying in bed by himself reading when the same beeping began from a point near the southwest corner of the bedroom and ceil- ing. Bill was facing the west. He lifted the book up in front of his face and acted as if he were reading. The in- tensity of the sound increased as it approached him. When the beeping was within about 3 to 5 feet, Bill dropped the book and looked. The beeping slowly re- treated, the sound appearing to lessen in intensity as the distance between it and Bill increased. The beeping dwin- dled to nothing and appeared to pass through the wall and into the outside environment. Incident 15. Bill liked to tinker, and he had two engines in his yard—both on palettes that served as workbenches. One palette was positioned on cinder-block legs and ele- vated off the ground. The other (supporting a com binder engine) rested on the ground and was a few feet away. As was his habit, Bill checked on the engines one morning. He discovered the elevated palette leaning pre- cariously on the cinder blocks and the engine dangerously poised and about to fall off. The cinder blocks of one leg had been jarred out of alignment. The engine on the sec- ond palette had been turned 45 degrees, and three shards of iron the size of a thumbnail were lying on the palette. (To Bill's knowledge, these fragments were not from the engine.) I personally attempted to lift the com binder en- gine but failed. JULY 1995 NUMBER 327 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Even during wintertime, the hammering continued. Investigations turned up no tracks in the snow. The hammering would last for a few days, or up to a week during the evening, stop fora few days, a week, or a month — and then begin again. Before this incident, Bill had discovered that someone or something had knocked the lid off a 5-gallon can of carburetor cleaner sitting on the porch. Rain had fallen into the can, ruining its contents. Additionally, a fence tightener had been dropped into the can. As Bill confronted his engines, he became enraged. Tampering with the carburetor cleaner was bad enough, but an attack on one of his fondest joys was inexcus- able. He threw his.>head back and screamed to the heav- ens: \"You sons-a-bitches had better leave me alone! You don't ruin my old engines!\" After that, harassment of that kind ceased. Incident 16. Bill described a sound that would begin in early evening and sometimes go on through the night. The sound originated near the irrigation ditch behind the house and seemed to come from above ground. Bill likened the sound to that of a steel post driver hammering a post over and over into the ground. The hammering would last about 15 or 20 minutes, stop for awhile, and then begin again. The moment Bill or a family member would walk around the house to investigate the source of the hammering, it would instantly cease. When the person had returned to the house, the sound would begin again. \"How many trips have you got to make with nothing there before you give up?\" Bill asked me. Even during wintertime, the hammering continued. Investigations turned up no tracks in the snow. The ham- mering would last for a few days, or up to a week during the evening, stop for a few days, a week, or a-month—and then begin again. Relatives visiting the Smiths also heard the hammering. In the morning after a night of the hammering, the rela- tives appeared tired. Bill told them: \"Don't pay it any mind. There's nothing out there.\" One of the Smiths' dog was terrified after a night of the hammering; the an- imal was down on its belly with its tail between its legs. In August 1980 the hammering ceased. The exact date the hammering began is unknown, although it apparently began in 1979. Incident 17. Bill took a day off to tinker on the old en- gine on the elevated palette workbench. (With Susan's help, Bill had re-righted the palette and realigned the cinder blocks after the occurrence of \"Incident 15.\") His back toward some weeds a few feet behind him, Bill heard the sound of a \"cricket.\" Yet this was a \"funny- sounding cricket,\" and the odd chirping was slowly ap- proaching him from behind. When the sound was within six to eight feet of him. Bill turned around. The chirping ceased; he saw nothing. As he returned to his work, the chirping began again. Curious, Bill put down his tools and walked toward the di- rection of the sound. The chirping stopped. \"I thought, 'Well, I scared the bug, or whatever it is.'\" As Bill stood there trying to see a cricket or a grasshop- per in the weeds, the sound started again, four to five feet away. Taking a step toward it, the sound stopped. \"1 thought to myself, 'What the hell, you're wasting time.' So I go back to the table, and I continue to work on the old engine. And the chirping starts again! So I say, 'What the hell, it's just some animal, that when I move I scare it.' \"I'm standing there with my back towards the sound, and suddenly there starts a whirling sound—like a string with pieces of plastic, or tin or something on it that would make—swissh! —a whirling sound. And this whirling sound gets faster and faster and faster. By this time I'm startled. I turn around. 1 can hear the swishing sound, this rotating, whirling sound. It moves from me down to- wards the trees (to his right). The limbs start whipping back and forth. This (invisible) thing goes faster and faster and faster, and it shoots up right here behind the house, up through the trees, and as it shoots off, the limbs wiggle and shake, and it's gone!\" Incident 18. One day Bill discovered that something had apparently \"landed\" on the lawn. The grass was crushed down in a rectangular shape measuring about five feet long and two feet wide. One end of the object had buried into the earth about an inch, \"scrunching\" up the dirt. The grass was matted in \"irregular designs.\" After two or three mowings, the grass finally stood up. Incident 19. In the spring of 1978 Bill awoke late at night. Recall that Bill was a heavy sleeper: \"For an unknown reason, I wake up. I come awake and there is right overhead toward the trees outside—not too high over the house—there is this sound of a huge, heavy engine turning real slow... idling. But the engine is out of sync. The sounds are not in synchronization like a V-8 idling. It would rumble—chuchu-boom, chuchu-boom— out of sync with itself. When I wake up I hear the noise. Then coining through every window around the bed- room, there's flashing red light. Just like on a police car, except it's not as fast.\" For about two minutes, Bill lay in bed, listening and watching, wondering if a wreck had occurred outside. But -he heard no siren, no voices, no barking from his dogs, no sounds but that of the engine—\"a heavy engine like on a Caterpillar, or a huge earth mover... a big engine... not revved up but in a slow idle.\" PAGES NUMBER 327 JULY 1995"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Bill roused his wife. She heard the sound and saw the flashing red light. The sound was of something in trouble, like it \"had a rod loose... like it was falling apart, like it was going to crash... about to fall on top of us.\" Bill told Susan to open the curtain and investigate. On one elbow, she pulled the curtain back. The moment she did, the lights flashed out. and \"this heavy engine idling overhead speeds up, and it slowly disappears out of sound.\" Incident 20. In early summer 1982, Bill awoke one late evening. Recall again that it was very unusual for any noise to wake Bill up. It seemed also unusual that he was suddenly wide awake and positioned on his back; he usually sleeps on his right or left side. As he lay there, he heard the sound of an electric motor—an \"electric motor with a dry bearing\" making a \"clicking\" sound. He used the bathroom and sat down in the living room and. lit a cigar. As he listened to the sound, he glanced at the window to his right and noticed that it was light out- side: he could clearly see the pickup and the trees. He went to the door, cranked open the louvers, and looked outside. Details were evident: the hay, his tools, the cars. The source of the light seemed to be coming from above the house. Then the light went out, and the sound receded. Bill stressed that he has never in his life awakened in the middle of the night to smoke a cigar in his living room. Incident 21. Shortly after Incident 20, Bill was outside working when he heard a tremendous \"whoosh\" pass over his house above the trees. The dog reacted by whin- ing. The sound traveled from the northeast to the south- west. 'T'wo clear-cut categories of experiences are evident A amid the collection of puzzling incidents presented here: the so-called \"paranormal\" or \"paraphysical\"—and Unidentified Flying Objects (lights and structured ob- jects). Faced with these many strange events, I constructed a number of questions in an attempt to find an answer. Are the Smiths \"attuned\" in some special way to both kinds of experiences, or have they been the unfortunate recipi- ents of the mischievous activities of these phenomena that either singled them out for harassment, or merely came upon the family by accident (the Smiths were \"neu- tral victims\") and decided to have \"run\" at the family's ex- pense? Is this force part of the total unknown phenomenon that inhabits the Yakima Indian Reservation and makes it- self known in the form of reddish-orange balls of light, Zeppelin-like \"craft,\" mysterious circular markings on automobile hoods and footsteps? Or are the nocturnal lights a separate entity in themselves, distinct and self-in- tegrated, the product of some rare natural force presently unknown to science? Are paraphysical phenomena the re- The cornbinding machine atop <i wooden palette, the supporting cinder blocks of which were rearranged (see Incident 15). and where si range chirping sounds were heard (Incident 19).

Were the Smiths visited by a poltergeist generated by themselves, or did the supernatural come to visit? Bill Smith was a down-to-earth, pragmatic man. He didn't believe in \"haints.or spooks,\" and found it impos- sible to conceive that the voices, footsteps and other lo- calized invisible activity around and in his house were from the dead come back to haunt the living. \"You don't fear dead men,\" he told me more than once. \"You keep your eye on live men.\" C onsider the following. Recall the voice outside the Smiths' window: to Susan the voice was that of a man \"casing out the place.\" Note also that the Smiths told me that their house was broken into at one time. Note that the apparent UFOs over the house (never actually seen) both have the sounds of engines that are in need of repair. Bill is a mechanic, and a good one, who spends many hours of his free time keeping his personal machines in sound working order. Why did these UFOs sound as if they were nearly falling apart? Did they take on a char- acteristic of something personal and singular in Bill's life? Was there something in Bill Smith that sought to channel itself out into the external environment, unleash- ing activity that taunted the seemingly unwilling viewer? Were his own emotions somehow reflected back at him through \"invisible beings\" who appear at first glance to be visitors from another world or dimension, but who in re- ality are somehow connected to himself? I wondered, following this line of reasoning, if some- thing going on in the family was the key. Interestingly, Todd Smith was 13 in 1970, when the paranormal events began occurring almost regularly. Todd showed evidence JULY 1995 NUMBER 327 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL of alienation from the family and turned to rebellious behavior, use of drugs, and waywardness. Were his frus- trations and emotions focused outward as \"noisy ghosts\" (the poltergeist theory)? But, according to Bill and Susan, Todd was rarely around when most of the incidents oc- curred (although present when a knife jumped out of a pan). Also, Mary was, according to Bill and Susan, a level-headed girl who was busy with extracurricular ac- tivities at school and never got in trouble. (Recall, how- ever, that she heard a woman's voice at the back of the house one day and was present with her parents during the first \"beeping\" episode.) If we can exclude Todd and Mary as the source of the phenomena, must we return to Bill as the culprit? Note that when Bill left the house for business trips (up to days at a time), the dogs, who normally reacted all night long to traffic on the road, other barking dogs, and noc- turnal sounds, were unusually quiet. Susan felt safe dur- ing these times. Why do the dogs generally remain quiet during these events? (The dogs did bark or whine during the \"vanish- ing-boy\" episode, the night of the \"circular markings\" in- cident, and the \"whistle-near-the-bridge\" incident.) If the dogs know that the occurrences stem from Bill, could they remain silent for that reason? Or is Susan the other \"cul- prit\"? Recall that Bill does not dream; at least, he never re- members dreaming when he awakes. On the other hand, Susan does and has had apparent precognitive dreams: At age 16 she dreamed that a friend of her father came to the door of the house and warned her father of ap- proaching \"revenooers.\" (Her father was making \"moon- shine.\") She thought of telling her father of the dream but didn't. The next day her father was arrested by govern- ment officials. (Coincidence?) In another dream she witnessed a car wreck. The car was a black Chevrolet with fins. Her brother was later in- jured in the exact same car. (She had never seen the car be- fore.) Other seemingly \"psychic\" experiences have happened to her. While in Neah Bay, Washington (before moving to the Reservation), Susan received a letter from her mother. Without opening it, she knew immediately that her mother was very ill (nothing in the letter indicated her mother's condition). Later, Susan learned that her mother had had surgery. Sometime in the early 1970s, Susan had very bad back pains although she wasn't ill. However, she felt that her brother was sick, and she called her mother long dis- tance, who said that her brother had the flu. Susan insisted there was something much more seriously wrong with him. A week later her mother telephoned: her brother was in the hospital with kidney stones. Susan told me that her father always said that she was a \"strange kid\" and that she was \"always different from the other kids\" (although he never elaborated on these statements). Susan told me that it is possible that people have a genetically derived ability to foresee the future. The following is an interesting story. Although not supporting the genetic hypothesis, it supports Susan's belief that she had precognitive abilities: Susan awoke one morning, depressed. Her depression grew as time wore on. As the depression intensified, Susan had a foreboding that some- thing terrible would happen. She attempted to carry on her daily activities. Bill had driven into town. After an hour and a half, she went outside, and without thinking turned the dogs loose and walked to the irrigation ditch in back of the house. She stood facing west and saw a white car trav- eling north along the highway a block away. As if in slow motion, the car crashed into a bridge abutment. At the very moment of the crash, Bill witnessed the accident from his car as he drove up to the house. Susan ran toward him: \"Did you see that?\" He told her to call the police, and he went to the crash scene. Susan's depression had ended. (The dogs did not bark during the 90-minute event.) I wondered if Susan had uncontrolled impulses to foresee events. She stated that she had the ability to \"read\" people; she received \"feelings\" about them, from their actions or words, and she was proud of this ability. Was she serving as a \"channel\" or a \"sensitive\" for para- normal events? Let us return to Bill. We have postulated (if for no other reason but certain coincidences) that he could be the source of these events (as could Susan). It is curious to note that the hammering sound went on until August 1980, in the month that relatives visited the Smiths. They had come for Mary's wedding. Getting married is a life passage, for the bride, groom and their families. Then, the hammering ceased. Coincidence? I continued to search for an answer. An Indian cemetery is located not far from the Smith residence. Could Bill's friend have been digging into sacred ground and dis- turbed \"spirits of the dead\"? The voices behind the house, engaged in apparent conversation: spirits of Indians? I even wondered if an intelligence could exist that wants us to believe, but to believe in anything the intelligence con- ceives, and by manifesting itself in and near a house lo- cated near a cemetery manages to compound the confu- sion and add to the deception that the intelligence was the dead? Yet how could we be dealing with the spirits of Indians when all the other voices spoke in English? I learned that a house once stood for many years on the land the Smith house now stands on. This house was ap- parently burned down when an irrigation-ditch fire raged out of control. I wanted to know who lived in the house but was unable to pursue this lead. Additionally, a mobile home stood on the property for four to five years before the Smiths arrived. If I could only find its inhabitants ... Occasionally, Bill would hear the faint sound of Indian drums being beat at night miles away to the southwest. PAGE 10 NUMBER 327 JULY 1995"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL This occurred during the period of ongoing paranormal phenomena. I received other reports of strange Indian drums heard by witnesses on the Reservation. Were these drumbeats \"real,\" part of secret Indian ceremonies carried on in the hills or something else? And so it came down to this: Were the Smiths' para : normal experiences initiated by a source outside of themselves, and which coincided with the prominent UFO activity that occurred on the reservation throughout the 1970s? Were those experiences coming from the same source as that of UFOs, and were both the para- normal and UFOs the varied aspects of a single, albeit complex, phenomenon? Perhaps those paranormal events that bore no similarity to the UFO phenomenon were linked to an internal mental process that \"pro- jected\" ideas into the outer environment. Of course, this concept has been prevalent in the UFO field for many years. Conceivably, the projections would be channeled through or by Bill and Susan. If so, maybe the projections arise from deepset emotions that are the re- sult of unspoken and unrecognized mental states. I did pursue this hypothesis during my investigations. Bill denied that he could project his voice unconsciously via ventriloquist techniques. One would think that if he did so, then perhaps Susan did the same (recall that she heard a woman's voice outside the window one night). (Mary would have had to consciously collude in the de- ception since she heard a woman's voice while walking the dogs.) Yet how does a person \"project\" a rosebud? The \"projection\" of mental experiences into the ex- ternal environment is in some ways a more fantastic assumption than the concept of UFOs themselves, at least UFOs conceived of as spacecraft. To conceive of a mechanism that draws upon the content of the human mind to fabricate voices, footsteps, ghostly shadows and \"crickets\" moves beyond the bounds of the debated evidence for UFO reality: multiple, independent wit- nesses, radar returns, photographic evidence and \"land- ing\" trace cases. No hard evidence exists in the Smith case. The rosebud was thrown away; the loaded Polaroid camera wasn't used even though it was close at hand; no photographs exist of the matted-down grass. W e are left with the question of hoax and hallucina- tion. An interesting aspect of this case made itself known in 1986. Several years had passed after my inter- views with the Smiths. Bill had other experiences to relate. They fit the same pattern as the others: noises, voices, strange things outside the house. Upon visiting the Smiths in their small, enclosed trailer, I found a gaunt, tired Bill. He pointed out a concave depression near his temple and reported that he had recently had surgery to remove a tu- mor growing on his optic nerve, and that he wasn't \"out of the woods.\" Later, on the way home, I wondered if all that he had experienced had been hallucinations, that over years, the slowly growing tumor had affected his cognitive processes. I felt I was on the verge of a solution. The com- plete absence of evidence suggested a man who, along with his family, had survived a period when stress and medical illness had taken on a form of the \"supernat- ural.\" It was true that the dogs were quiet when Bill was away, and they rarely barked during the episodes. All the phenomena seemed internally caused. But, Bill didn't think so. Bill believed the phenomena were real. He found the hammering incident annoying; time and again he had to leave the house to seek an an- swer and found none. He stated that all the phenomena ever did were to distract him and interrupt his work. He had experienced uneasiness resulting from some of the experiences. \"It is foolishness,\" he said. If superior be- ings were behind the events, they were \"a form of intel- ligence playing with man.\" He noted that the instant Susan opened the window during the \"out-of-sync-en- gine\" episode, the light went out and the sound receded; when he opened the louvers in the door during the \"dry- bearing electric-motor\" episode, the light outside went out; when he turned around to find the source of the \"cricket\" sound, the sound stopped; and so forth. A nd so, what do we conclude? In some ways, it seemed the Smiths were haunted, even though Bill denied it. Perhaps UFOs and the paranormal are just that—an intelligence that lingers around certain peo- ple, haunts certain locales. For this wasn't the first time that the Smiths had experienced the unknown. In the early 1960s, while driving in southeastern Oklahoma, after visiting Susan in Fort Smith where she was attending school, Bill rounded a hill and saw a bright, flashing red light coming toward him in the dis- tance. Parking at a roadside rest area, he watched the silent light stop a half mile away and remain stationary as it continued to flash. After five minutes, the flashing fight retreated, vanishing into the distance. Then, living in a log house in Tallahanee, Oklahoma, Bill and Susan observed three lights—white, red and blue—that alternately remained stationary and then swayed like pendulums, bobbed and spun. After the Smiths moved west, they lived in Neah Bay, Washington, on the coast. Here they observed, while rambling on the beach, a.roundish, orangeish-red light, similar to the kind of light they would later observe on the reservation, traveling horizontally north to south about four miles out over the Pacific. In one motion, the light changed'course and went straight down and entered the ocean. Also, while at Neah Bay, one night Bill heard the front door open, the tread of feet, and then felt some- thing large and heavy press down on his chest. He strug- gled to get free and finally cried out to Jesus Christ to help him. The weight instantly vanished. People pursued, \\vatched, toyed with by an unknown intelligence from off the planet?

Bullard, Ph.D. If aliens are indeed after human ova for a hybrid breeding program, would females theoretically be abducted on a regular basis or cycle, perhaps one in tune with the menstrual cycle itself? One abductee's numbers are put to the test... I t was.during an interview conducted by a writer with Omni magazine that I was reminded of the phrase, \"Leave no stone un-turned.\" After what felt like an eternity of answering questions and shuffling through my office for charts, files and notes, I asked him what he thought of my researcher's supplement. One of the main points I remember about this interview was be- ing told, \"Yes—but the numbers aren't statistically sig- nificant.\" What I had asked was his input on a personal re- search project I published in Section I of The Alien Jigsaw Researcher's Supplement. Section I covers four and a half years of data in which I correlated my ab- duction experiences with specific times of the month. Did a key to the whole purpose of abductions lie in this relationship? It seemed like a promising fit because one of the most popular theories as to why alien beings might be coming to Earth is to abduct humans for the collection of sperm and ova samples. As I stated in my researcher's supplement, \"The general theory is that this sample taking is for the purposes of creating life, and this new life is being created from a combination of genetic material from human beings and alien beings. The results are what abduction researchers call a hybrid being.\"' 2 Many reports backed up this supposition, and I strongly believed it merited further exploration. When I considered the idea of sample taking, I be- lieved one way a female abductee could collect mean- ingful data was to document abduction experiences dur- ing particular times of each month. My conjecture was, depending on the particular biological and hormonal changes that occur within the human female each month, perhaps some type of correlation would be found to ex- ist between time of the month and frequency of abduc- tions. Here was an exciting opportunity to put the theory to the test. The following information is taken from my re- searcher's supplement: \"The dates used in this supple- ment are taken from my journals. (My journals were published in The Alien Jigsaw in 1994.) They represent the dates I strongly believe interaction between an alien being and myself transpired. The dates indicating spon- taneous memories and memories that surfaced in dreams are clearly indicated as such in this supplement and are not included with the data in Section I titled, \"The Human Menstrual Cycle.\" There are three sets of data I had to work with from the table under the topic Menstrual Cycle (hereafter called M. cycle). These categories are: Undocumented, Actual Dates and Inferred Dates. Specific dates were not always obtainable for a variety of reasons. Undocumented means the experience as it correlated with the M. cycle for that month was not, or could not, be documented. The total number of my experiences that fall in this category are fourteen. (I then listed the specific dates and the reasons for each undocumented experience, but will not do so here for reasons of con- ciseness.) Sixty-six percent of my experiences were docu- mented as they relate to my M. cycle with 100% accu- racy. These dates and experiences were designated Actual Dates. There were times when I did not document when my M. cycle occurred. For these time periods, 1 calcu- lated Inferred Dates by counting from the last known M. cycle forward. If the time period was for three or four months in a row, (which only occurred once) I would count forward 28 days for one month (month one), and forward 25 days for the next month (month two), since I averaged a M. cycle every 25 to 28 days. I would then count back from the next Actual Date the same way (month three and month four). This allowed for more accuracy between the two known M. cycle dates. Twenty-three percent of my experiences have in- ferred dates. This data will be included under the cate- gory heading Actual and Inferred Dates. The number of Actual and Inferred Dates accounts for 88% of my ab- duction experiences.\" The different phases of the M. cycle and what occurs in the body during that stage were described. This will be omitted from this paper, and for reasons of concise- ness, I will simply give the name of the phase and the frequency of abductions documented during that phase over a four and a half year time frame.

I discovered that the highest frequency of my abductions occurred during the first eight days of the secretory phase, or the first eight days after ovulation. First 8 days after ovulation (days 15-22) Actual Dates: 37% First 8 days after ovulation (days 15-22) Actual and Inferred Dates: 33% Other abduction related experiences that I remem- bered involving skin scrapings, hair clippings, surgery, gynecological procedures, laparoscopy and implants were charted and their frequencies were given. However, they will not be covered here since they do not directly relate to this paper. I concluded by saying: I believe there is merit to the the- ory about the collection of ova for reproductive study by some of the alien beings. In addition to the testimony from many other abductees, the fact that I was abducted more often during the week after ovulation leads me to (hy- pothesize) that the aliens miay in fact be collecting ova (or possibly fertilizing ova) during this time frame. Looking at this from a scientific point of view, why would anyone collect the seeds, if you will, of reproduction if they were not going to study how reproduction occurs? If the eight-day time period immediately following ovulation turns out to be directly related to the life- span of a fertile ovum, and other female abductees are being abducted more often during the first eight days of the secretory phase of their menstrual cycle, we may have another piece of information to lend support to the theory that the aliens are collecting ova. It may not support the reason why (we believe) they are collecting ova, but simply that they are. 3 FURTHER INVESTIGATION I was thankful that the interviewer with Omni pointed out what he considered a discrepancy with my hypothesis. After the interview I found that I was more inspired than ever to investigate the possible correlation between times of the month and frequency of abductions. Over the last several years I have often been told by other female abductees that they felt they were being visited during a particular time of the month (usually around ovulation). However, I have yet to locate anyone who has actually documented the dates in their journal. I then decided, in the interest of a true scientific investigation, that I would have to obtain a scientific analysis of my data. I am very fortunate to have obtained an analysis of the data just described. The analysis was performed by Thomas E. Bullard, Ph.D., of Indiana University at Bloomington, Indiana. I would like to thank Dr. Bullard for his analysis and for his excellent explanations di- rected to both the lay investigator and the professional researcher. Below is the complete analysis with notes and comments from Dr. Bullard. EXPLAINING THE STATISTICAL TEST What we want to know is, \"Are some days more abduc- tion-prone than others?\" and if so, \"Do abduction-prone days correspond to any segment of the menstrual cycle?\" If the answer is yes, then perhaps the aliens call be- cause something related to that cycle attracts or interests them. If the answer is no, then they time their visits ac- cording to some other schedule, or according to no ap- parent schedule at all. The \"chi-square\" test compares the data in hand with what we expect to see if events happen according to ran- dom chance. Flip a coin long enough and we should count an equal number of heads and tails. If we get a lot more heads than tails, something besides chance is at work—maybe the coin is warped or weighted. Whatever the reason, if the results violate expectations based on chance, we can feel confident that some more specific cause shaped the results. The same principle applies to your abduction data. If abductions scatter randomly across the monthly calendar, there's no reason to suspect the abductions relate in any way with the menstrual cycle. If the events concentrate into some segments of the cycle and slight others, then we have good reason to suspect some relationship. Another question is, \"At what point does a differ- ence from expectation become significant?\" Flip a coin 100 times and we would expect a perfect 50 heads-50 tails. In reality we might get 51 heads and 49 tails in- stead. That's a difference, but a small one—too small to be significant. This difference falls within the bounds of chance. The chi-'square test provides the benchmarks to judge where chance differences end and significant differences begin. The test sets up a \"null hypothesis,\" that is, it defines the ideal chance situation. A proper null hypothesis for JULY 1995 NUMBER 327 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL your data says that one day for an abduction is as good as the next, no day or days related to the menstrual cycle finds special favor. A calculation of the estimated events for each category must allow the beings equal chance to carry out an abduction on all 28 (or 31) days. Using both the 28-day data and the 31-day data, for the \"actual\" and \"actual and inferred\" tables, the expected number of events per day is shown below, for example, 77 events di- vided by 28 days, giving 2.75 events per day. The final expected value for each category is this daily rate multi- plied by the number of days per category. A comparison of the expected frequencies of events with the actual frequencies you list in your tables comes next. What we are looking for is a \"goodness of fit.\" Does the pattern of events you've set out match the expected pat- tern, or not? If the two patterns match, the \"fit\" is a good one and there is no reason to look for anything but chance to explain why your events fall on the dates they do. If the patterns fail to match, the alternative hypothesis is true—the probabilities are not identical, not chance, but something else arranges the distribution of events. The procedures of the chi-square test have complex ra- tionales rooted in probability distributions, but the method is a tried-and-true way to compare the expected- vs.-observed patterns and arrive at a likelihood of the two being alike or different. Standard tables give values that represent significant cutoff points. For a case with one de- gree of freedom (that is, one variable), a chi-square of 3.84 sets a probability limit of 5%. This means any value over 3.84 has a less than 5% probability of being due to mere chance, while any value under 3.84 has a greater than 5% likelihood of resulting from chance. A test using five degrees of freedom—in this case, one that looks at all your data at once—has a value of 11.07 to mark 5% probability. This percentage is an arbitrary mark and is considered a weak threshold of significance. Something stronger is usually necessary to make us sit up and take notice, commonly the 1% benchmark, or a chi-square value of 15.09 in the case of this test.

Just compare the \"cases\" column with the \"expected\" column for each category and the numbers are not far apart—pretty good intuitive evi- dence that no surprises are in store. The tests only reaf- firm this impression. Three individual values out of twelve in the \"actual\" table squeak past the 5% signifi- cance barrier, only one in the \"actual and inferred\" table. None of the values pass the 1% test. DR. BULLARD'S CONCLUSIONS My conclusion would have to be that your events follow pretty much the distribution expected by chance. There are no striking concentrations of events during the days of any category, nor is any category notably lacking in events. The few significant readings are weak at best and marginal as well. In both tables the 31-day value for the last category reaches a low significance mark, but these data are unusual because they exceed the 28-day cycle and are, as you say, uncommon for you. These maverick data points are liable to upset the typical pattern of dis- tributions, and seem to do so here. The overall tendency is very clear—frequencies depend on chance alone. For want of any persuasive evidence to the contrary, it seems to me that your abduction events are not related to phases of the menstrual cycle. I realize this conclusion is a disappointment, to you and me alike. We have so many questions and so few an- swers for this phenomenon, so little hard data. The prospect of finding something substantial, such as your data promised, is just the sort of thing we need. However, even this negative result is valuable knowledge in its own right. It is, moreover, worth publishing. It does bear on the hybridization hypothesis, and researchers ought to know that the tie between abduction events and the menstrual cycle is hot obvious and common. I want to congratulate you on your care in keeping meticulous records of your experiences and using these records to test a hypothesis. This is the true scientific PAGE 14 NUMBER 327 JULY 1995"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL spirit, much unlike the skeptics who make armchair pronouncements, or for that matter, ufologists who may start out with data from legitimate investigations, but then press it into illicit speculations without proper test or considerations. It would be valuable to compare sim- ilar records of other abductees' events. KATHARINA'S COMMENTS I would like to thank Dr. Bullard for his analysis and ex- planations. The results from Section I of my researcher's supplement and this analysis are not meant to imply that the aliens are, or are not collecting ova from female abductees. It means that if they are, they may not need to collect ova during a particular time of the month. It seems in my case, it does not matter what types of bio- logical changes are occurring (within the human fe- male reproductive cycle), as to whether or not the aliens are going to abduct me. Is there still merit to the hypothesis that aliens are re- trieving ova from their human specimens? Some ab- ductees sincerely believe that they are being abducted more often around the time of ovulation. I may have had more encounters during this time frame (the first eight days of the secretory phase), but the number of en- counters are not statistically significant. We should view these results with care. It is not the intention of this study to infer that these findings relate to all abductees everywhere. As Dr. Bullard stated, we should compare similar records of other abductee's events. It is my hope as well, that others will read this re- port and pursue a similar investigation. Until that time comes, we should ask ourselves two important ques- tions: \"Are too many assumptions being made based more on the 'feelings' that abductees relay rather than on carefully documented experiences that can be scruti- nized by statistical analysis?\" \"Are abductees (perhaps unconsciously) trying to make their experiences fit the hypotheses of the most well-publicized researchers?\" No one in abduction research likes these questions, but we must ask ourselves questions like these from time to time, if only for the benefit of keeping our- selves grounded. We should stringently evaluate not only the information, but the source of the information and the methodology of the researcher and lay investi- gator alike. The Alien Jigsaw Researcher's Supplement contains four other sections that are not statistical in nature. The information covers what I describe as 119 abduction-re- lated experiences over a thirty-two year time period. Topics include the frequency of: (1) types of beings, (2) types of craft, (3) locations, (4) physiological, psycho- logical and emotional effects, and (5) abductions in- volving telepathy, travel and control.

JULY 1995 NUMBER 327 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL MIRAGE SALE by Martin Kottmeyer T his book presents us with a new unsolved mystery before we even get past the cover. Why is the photo from the Trindade, Brazil case of 1958 displayed there printed negative? It's not an accident. A caption is pro- vided on the back cover which admits the reversed char- acter of the image. I won't deny it looks more beautiful in the negative. It could almost pass as a galaxy set against the black of night. Printed this way, the Trindade UFO is seemingly being offered as an iconic represen- tation of an astronomical mirage, Campbell's \"solu- tion\" to the UFO mystery. Yet it also calls attention to what would strike many as a fatal flaw in his handling of the Trindade case. Campbell argues the Trindade photos show the image of the planet Jupiter magnified 50 times in the vertical dimension, magnified 100 times in the horizontal di- mension, split by a temperature inversion in the atmos- phere, and spread along the merge line of the upper segment of the planetary image with its inverted reflec- tion. Yet the Trindade photos were taken in the early af- ternoon. There is no black of night behind this UFO. The image itself is darker than the surrounding sky in the original photo. Unless mirages can perform Shroud of Turin miracles, such a solution can't be right. Printing the Trindade photo negative is a veritable confession and flaunting of this incongruity. Is this some kind of warn- ing to the reader to beware of similar Jovian jokes throughout this book? Though a prudent thought, I'm inclined to accept that Campbell really does believe rmrages perform miracles. Or, more fairly, I should say that nu rages perform tricks. As solved by Campbell, the UFO phenomenon is an il- lusion that is all-done-with-mirrors. The mirrors are sheets of atmosphere formed by layers of differing tem- peratures that bend light so that what is seen is not what really is. A lake in the distance is really desert reflecting sky. A flying Dutchman is really a conventional boat beyond the horizon whose image has been bent sky- ward. And UFOs? For Campbell, they are really stars and planets that are displaced, distorted and distended by the optical properties of thermoclines in the atmosphere. Mirages themselves are real enough and have been described often by trained observers. The problem that has to bother the reader is that there is often no precedent for some of the tricks Campbell has his mirages do. Things like extraordinary magnifications — Altair bal- looned to the size of the Moon — images stretched at nonvertical angles, and images being imparted horizon- tal motions. He also repeatedly makes recourse to mi- rages that make stars and planets visible in the day- time. Campbell offers no citations to reports of such things in the scientific literature and a look through SOLVED William Corliss's treasury of anomalies. Rare Halos, Mirages, Anomalous Rainbows and Related Electromagnetic Phenomena (Sourcebook Project, 1984) gives no confidence such things happen. Campbell postulates these tricks as theoretical possi- bilities. He cites a remark in J.B. Sidgwick's Amateur Astronomer's Handbook (Dover, 1971 pp. 30-1) that telescopes can make stars visible in daylight by the re- duction of sky brightness during magnification as justi- fication of his use of mirages to explain daylight discs. I know high magnification does reduce sky brightness from my own use of a telescope, but what sort of mirage generates the orders of magnitude of magnification needed for this effect? Dozens, hundreds of degrees? How is such a differential created and maintained with- out the layer dropping convectively straight to ground? Perhaps more importantly, one never sees mentioned in UFO reports a line of darkening across the sky cor- responding to this thermocline running through the UFO image. Such a line would probably be more impressive than the UFO itself. In Campbell's schema, we have an explanation of the shape of the classic flying saucer involving the merging of a magnified astronomical body and its inverted re- PAGE 16 NUMBER 327 JULY 1995"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL o o O 0 upright images n o c\"~} <~> inverted images According to author Campbell, the above mirage effect results in a \"classic\" flying saucer, but where's the dome? From \"The UFO Mystery Solved, \"figure 3.8, p. 58. flection at the boundary of the inversion layer. Notably unmentioned is that such an image would be fleeting for virtually every astronomical body except the Moon and Sun. The rotation of the earth causes astronomical bodies to travel at a rate of 15 seconds angular longitude per second of time. Venus, at inferior conjunction, ex- tends at most 61 seconds of arc and would take only four seconds of time to cross the mirage boundary and it would show a saucer profile for under two. Other planets are smaller still and would be corespondingly more fleet- ing as saucer illusions. More troublesome still, how many UFO reports can you think of ever had a saucer shape-shifting from or into a figure-8 double-ball image? How many can you think of where the saucer formed from two balls of light that merged together vertically? When we get into specific cases, the explanations take on aspects that create an effect of one jaw-dropping act of chutzpah after another. Some examples that stood out for me: Kenneth Arnold, 1947. Campbell proposes the nine supersonic objects are mirages of nine distant mountain peaks. They range in altitude from 2201 meters to 3221m, however, and would seemingly create substantial differences in image size. Arnold doesn't mention major disparities in size, though allowing that object eight might have been larger since he saw more detail on it. The mountain corresponding to #8 in Campbell's sce- nario, however, is one of the smaller ones. To account for the motion Campbell postulates that Arnold confused Mount Rainier and Mount Adams with Pinnacle Peak and Lookout of the Tatoosh Range. They are roughly half the size of these national landmarks! Chiles-Whitted, 1948. Campbell proposes this in- volved a mirage of the star Aldebaran (magnitude +0.78). This for a UFO so brilliant the pilots purportedly experienced lightning blindness when the afterburners kicked in. Mantell, 1948. You thought this was solved with the Skyhook ballon explanation? Campbell suggests it was a day-time mirage of Jupiter instead. Clyde Tombaugh, 1949. Tombaugh reported six to eight rectangles of light directly overhead. A drawing shows the rectangles equal in size and spaced geomet- rically. Campbell is rhetorically amazed that this pro- fessional astronomer failed to consider Jupiter and its major satellites reflected off a mirage as an explanation. I would have been more amazed had Tombaugh been so daft as to consider Jupiter as equal in size and luminos- ity as its satellites. Great Falls, Montana; 1950. The two bright objects on this film, according to Campbell, are duplicate mirage images of the star Deneb formed by a moving vertical thermocline. Deneb has a stellar magnitude of +1.26. The objects in the film strike me as being at least 10 to 15 magnitudes brighter. Call me unimaginative, but I have a hard time believing Raman brightening involving the constructive interference of light near the boundary could ever yield light amplification that strong. Nor do I find it plausible that this vertical thermocline perfectly pirouettes around the observer long enough for him to get the camera and film it for 14 seconds. Where is the band of sky darkening marking this thermocline? Tremonton, Utah; 1952. Campbell feels it is \"almost certain\" mirages of a group of stars were filmed here. Candidate objects include the constellations of Draco, Ursa Minor, or ducted light from Vega. I feel almost cer- tain Campbell has never seen this film (or Great Falls ei- ther) even though readily obtainable on video: get the 1956 documentary \"U.F.O.\" The objects flock and mill around like birds. The motions are incomprehensible if the objects are thought to be stars and mirrored doubles. Christopher Avis, 1977. Sketches are provided of a pair of strange clouds as they change over a period of seven minutes. One of these is attributed to the stretch- ing and splitting of an image of Mercury. Campbell touts it as giving \"fascinating insight into the behavior of an astronomical mirage.\" But the stretching occurs at the unlikely angle of 600, instead of vertically as is usually the case off horizontally layered inversions. It is slightly odd that this is also taking place at sunrise before day- time heating is able to generate thermal discontinuities. The sketches remind me of how jet contrails reflect An eyewitness sketch of a UFO reported at Tayside. Scotland. According to Campbell, \"it probably shows a mirage of Mars. \" From \"The UFO Mystery Sfllved, \" color plate -t.2, between pages 64-5.

C ampbell \"solves\" dozens of other cases by the artful application of his stellar mirages. They include not just nocturnal lights and daylight discs but even close encounters like those of Father Gill, Lonnie Zamora, and Alan Godfrey. I will say in defense of the book that it is strangely engrossing in the manner of high camp. Campbell recounts his conflicts with other ufologists, usually skeptics, and reports their criticisms with his re- joinders. Sometimes this creates a quality of denial not un- like the Black Knight in \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" who refuses to admit that King Arthur has chopped off his arm or is getting the better of him. Campbell be- lieves he really has triumphed over the UFO problem at the end of it all. The strange thing though is I can't see where he has convincingly solved even one of all these cases he has hacked away at. It isn't that I don't believe that stellar mirages couldn't exist; I'd be more surprised if they didn't. I simply can't buy into the explanations he of- fers in the cases I am familiar with. I wish I could tactfully find one case in which I could endorse his explanation, but there's nothing there to grab onto. No oasis.

John Carpenter \"Does Sleep Paralysis Explain Abductions?\" I t must first be understood that sleep paralysis is a real physiological condition that can occur theoretically in anybody. During dreaming or REM sleep the cen- tral nervous system paralyzes the body except for the eyes. In the reticular formation in the brain stem an in- hibition is produced which affects all muscle tone except for the eyes. In sleep paralysis this inhibition occurs during waking consciousness. In other words, the mind awakens before the body does and is able to perceive this physiological condition briefly which is a normal part of sleeping. It is interesting of course that many abductees report bedroom encounters, a paralysis, and abductions in which they, often can only move their eyes. Another feature is that those experiencing sleep paralysis often feel an unusual and disturbing presence of \"something else\" in the room during this period of distorted per- ceptions. Abductees also claim to awaken to something unusual at their bedside. According to David Hufford, author of The Terror That Comes in the Night, he was not at all surprised that the Roper Poll (for the 1992 booklet Unusual Personal Experiences) arrived at an 18% response rate for people reporting this bedside presence during the night since he had already arrived at a 17% response rate one year earlier with a questionnaire regarding sleep paralysis. It is un- derstandable why some professionals like Robert Baker, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus from the University of Kentucky, claim that abductions can be explained by episodes of confusing sleep paralysis. But can all abductions be neatly explained by this physiological phenomenon? Even David Hufford, a re- searcher of sleep paralysis for nearly 25 years, says that there are many anomalous events that persist beyond the scope of this paralyzing occurrence and that much further study is needed to understand the whole picture. There is even a suggestion in his remarks (Alien Discussions, p. 352) that alien beings might be able to trigger or manip- ulate such a paralysis in humans using the same physio- logical means. It is too fair to conclude that some people are misled by their own nocturnal experiences of this sort into thinking that they are being visited by aliens. But what if you are awake in broad daylight? Or with a group of people traveling in a car? Or walking with a friend in the park? And in each of these situations you are amazed and excited at seeing an UFO; your heart pounds, your blood races, your mind is very alert and focused! How could these be the hypnogogic hallucinations expe- rienced when falling asleep? How could these be the dis- torted perceptions during a sleep paralysis? How could this be hypnopompic imagery as one awakens from dreaming? The obvious answer is that sleep paralysis cannot account for all reports of alleged UFO abduc- tions due to just these circumstances alone. Multiple participant abduction cases further complicate the notion of sleep paralysis as a viable explanation. When two or more abduction participants independently report not only the same descriptive details of a two- hour encounter in great depth but also accurately de- scribe what each saw the other doing during various points in time, it is difficult to imagine how two inde- pendent minds could randomly fabricate such sleep im- agery (while awake of course) so accurately and in proper sequence. Then the question would be this: How do thou- sands of people from such diverse backgrounds and sets of personal experiences also arrive at such strikingly sim- ilar sleep imagery or nocturnal hallucinations? Why would everyone see skinny little gray beings with big black eyes using telepathy, performing confusing exams, and floating us in beams of blue light? I have an interesting case in which a husband and wife both reported awakening paralyzed but able to watch a red glow in the corner of the bedroom. Although this oc- PAGE 18 NUMBER 327 JULY 1995"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ful over recalling that night. She also recalled a thin white being near her one-year-old daughter's crib at the foot of their bed. They both remember being released simulta- neously from the paralysis, jumping out of bed at the same time, and only then realizing what they had both been, watching and experiencing simultaneously for the last 15 minutes or so. It would seem unlikely that they would both awaken in a state of sleep paralysis, image the same unusual visions, share the same intense emotions, and be free to jump up at the same moment, completely unaware of the other's simultaneous matching experi- ence. Hypnosis was used to explore this intensely emo- tional event which was preventing him from functioning at work some 16 years later! Both recalled under hypno- sis that a little gray being appeared out of the red ball of light and approached their daughter's crib while they were both held paralyzed in bed. They watched help- lessly in terror as the little being lifted their wide-eyed daughter out of the crib and out of the room. Certainly this serves to explain the hidden traumatic element — which remained so intense for 16 years — as any parent would cringe at being so helpless while being allowed to watch this supernatural kidnapping. It gives us another consid- eration regarding sleep paralysis: Are alien beings tapping into an already-present physiological mechanism in order to detain us, delay us, or even keep us sound asleep while others are being removed from the house? How could two parents be held the same length of time, envision the .same terrifying images, and be released simultaneously by chance? Some skeptics try to claim all abductions are functions of sleep phenomena. When the four men in the Allagash case (Allagash Abductions by Raymond Fowler) are pad- dling furiously to get back to shore before an anomalous blue beam of light overtakes their canoe, it is difficult to believe that they are falling asleep or experiencing a paralysis from REM sleep. In my case with Skye Ambrose and her friend Jennifer driving back from Colorado in late 1989, their adrenalin is pumping and their excitement at a peak when they begin to experience anomalous events. They were hardly getting drowsy and falling asleep at the wheel! Nor is it believable that sleepy misperceptions produced the matching 43 specific de- tailed correlations of being abducted aboard an alien craft from their subsequent independent hypnosis sessions. Despite the actual causation for any of these accounts, it is safe to say that some notions of feeling abducted stem from confusing moments of sleep paralysis, a natural physiological condition, but that sleep paralysis does not begin to explain all accounts of alleged UFO abductions, even though a superficial and naive examination by crit- ics might lead the public to believe so. Carpenter's next column is \"Expectations: Are They an Influence?\" John's e-mail address is StarmanJC@AOL.com Letters to Mufon UFO Journal CONFUSED Last year I joined MUFON and I found some of the ar- ticles in the Journal extremely interesting, and some that I had no idea what was written about. Now I find myself totally confused. First, 1 read about the so-called \"Roswell film\" that the film probably is a fake, but how does the author know that? Was there anyone there who saw any of the aliens at Roswell? Was there anyone there who saw a live alien at any time in their life? Is hearsay enough? I saw another film that portrayed aliens purportedly coming into a house during a birthday party. The pro- ducer later admitted that the film was a fake. The prob- lem is that an alleged UFO alien expert had already said he believed that the film was genuine. The expert had made his judgment on what the \"abductees\" had said, again, mere hearsay. Maybe MUFON should form a committee of abductees to judge such films. The next article I read was Roberta Puhalski's \"Fall From Grace.\" First, society told abductees that these happenings were their imagination, and now they are be- ginning to think that maybe something is happening. Now where does this leave the abductee? Once a person finds out that they were really abducted, what then? If they are lucky they can find a group of other abductees, but then what? Once an abductee tells their story, which is like taking a bad test, they feel better. The problem is, why do they feel stress afterward for no apparent reason? Is this de- layed stress syndrome? I don't think so. If abductees can be programmed to be at a certain place at a certain time, why can't they also be programmed to do a certain ac- tivity? Abduction of the body ends with each incident. Abduction of the person is an ongoing process. Concentrate on the buzz sounds. A person's experience is important only to that person. Each person is given an experience for a specific purpose. — Donna Bahor Masury. OH Much about the UFO phenomenon is confusing by its very nature.

Although the author's opinions are his own and not those of MUFON, they were based, to some extent, on the fact that the \"alien \" portrayed in the film (six toes, six fingers, etc.) in no way agreed with accounts given by alleged eyewitnesses of the event. SPACE TREATIES I would like to recommend to anyone interested in the rumored U.S. Government's involvement with space aliens to read \"SPACE LAW, Selected Basic Documents, Second Edition. Prepared at the Request of (the) Hon. Howard W. Cannon, Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation United States Senate. December 1978.\" This bound edition was pub- lished by the U.S. Government Printing Office. It is a compilation of all the primary and significant International Space Agreements and Treaties to which the U.S. is a party. There are a great many countries throughout the world who are signatories. The U.S. would be in violation of these international treaties and laws if it were participating in covert contact, alien bases, secret alliances and allowing abductions of its cit- izens by extraterrestrial races. — Victoria Alexander Santa Fe, NM So? Governments and individuals routinely violate treaties and laws virtually every day of the week. That isn 't meant to imply that secret underground bases and alien diplomatic treaties do exist — only that, if they did, an international treaty betvceen the U.S. and other countries wouldn 't necessarily be worth the paper it's printed on. There are laws against blowing up federal buildings, too, but the printed page doesn 't guarantee that someone won't do it. BROOKINGS REPORT Robert Durant (\"The Brookings Report,\".June 1995) contrasts the CIA's \"Robertson report\" on UFOs with the NASA Brookings Report on space exploration in an unsuccessful attempt to show how the Government (with the connivance of a handful of physicists) treated UFOs with totalitarian secrecy, but when the subject was space exploration and ETs, it worked (using \"a small army\" of social scientists) in a \"scholarly and gently humanistic\" way. His politically correct UFOLogical skirts are show- ing! 1) According to Durant, the Brookings panel repre- sented a consensus of the \"establishment\" circa 1959. He failed to note that the 1953 Robertson panel was con- cerned with the national security implications of UFO reports, following the 1952 sighting flap. During the Washington, DC sighting it became apparent that the air defense of the Nation's capitol was in the hands of two interceptors which took 40 minutes to arrive. This was during the McCarthy period, during wartime, in a Presidential election year (with a popular military figure the opposition candidate), and while a national political convention was in progress (UFOs stole the front pages). It's no wonder President Truman wanted to know what the hell was going on! 2) Durant wants us to believe that the Robertson re- port was only made public \"decades later\" and then only through the \"crowbar\" of the 1974 Freedom of Information Act. In fact, the report was issued nearly in its entirety 13 years later with the 1969 University of Colorado Report. Missing were only the names of CIA officials, a consultant, and which panel members had made specific recommendations. The existence of the panel had been revealed by former Blue Book chief Edward J. Ruppelt in his 1956 book, sparking the 1958 release by the Air Force of a \"sanitized\" summary. 3) Mr. Durant then goes on to lay out the NASA study in detail, but deliberately ignores what was the most important recommendation of the Robertson panel: that all UFO-related files be released to strip the subject of its unwarranted aura of secrecy. While this was never done, it hardly represented the \"ominous\" recommen- dation of a \"totalitarian\" state! Missing the difference between Korean War national security concerns, properly the province of intelligence and military agencies, and philisophical ruminations by a public panel of academics does not lead us to an hon- est understanding of the history of the UFO issue in America. — Robert R.

JULY 1995 NUMBER 327 PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Walter N. Webb - D August 1995 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars (1.4 magnitude), in Virgo, can be seen in the WSW at dusk but sets in the W about 9:45 in midmonth. The fading ruddy planet passes 2° above the star Spica on August 26 and 27. On the 29th Mars lies near the lunar crescent. Jupiter (2.2), still near the Ophiuchus/Scorpius boundary in the vicinity of red Antares, stands in the SSW at dusk and sets later in the WSW around midnight. The gaseous world re- sumes eastward motion on August 2. It lies near the gibbous moon on the 5th. Saturn (0.8). in Aquarius, rises in the E about 9 PM in mid- August and progresses westward during the night. For a sec- ond time, our faster-moving Earth overtakes Saturn and crosses its ring plane on August 10. At that time the big outer planet will appear ringless. See May Night Sky. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Saturn is in the SW at dawn. Meteor Showers: The great Perseid displays of recent years show signs of weakening. Last year, however. West Coast observers re- ported rates of 250 or more per hour. Unfortunately for the U.S. this time around, the secondary peak producing the in- tense display occurs during daylight hours on August 12. In addition, a bright Moon interferes all night on the 12th-13th. Still, the Perseids are bright and can produce spectacular fire- balls. Both the Perseids (coming from the NE) and the slower Aquarids (from the S) dart across the heavens in lesser num- bers throughout the first half of August. Moon Phases: First quarter—August 3 Full moon—August 10 Last quarter—August 17 New moon—August 26 The Stars: As the Summer Triangle reaches its highest point in the sky, already we are given a preview of the autumn months to come. The Great Square of Pegasus, Aquarius and Capricornus all are visible in the E and SE at 10 PM. Since the constellation Lyra the Harp is directly overhead now, this is a good time to point out a couple of telescopic sights within its borders. A few degrees from brilliant Vega is the \"double-double,\" Epsilon Lyrae. To the unaided eye the 4th magnitude star appears single. Binoculars reveal two stars, and in a small telescope each of the components is itself double, making a total of four stars. Lyra contains another famous object, the Ring Nebula, located between the bottom two stars of the harp's crooked rectangle. Look first for a \"smudgy star\" in a telescope then use higher powers to resolve the smudge into a \"smoke ring\" or \"dough- nut.\" The nebula represents a spherical shell of gas cast off by a faint dying star in the center.

PAGE 22 NUMBER 327 JULY 1995"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL LATE UPDATE SEATTLE, WA — To say that everyone had a good time transgresses cliche. But when even Philip Klass is seen mingling and smiling, surrounded by the curious and critical alike, it seems safe to say that the some 700 other people who attended MUFON's 26th annual sympo- sium in Seattle earlier this month did, indeed, have a good time. Most of those with whom I spoke thought it one of the more enjoyable such symposia in recent memory. Certainly the published Proceedings (at 315 pages) are the largest and most handsome yet. The next best thing to being there, they are now available from MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155, for $25 plus $1.50 postage and handling. The Seattle symposium proved particularly rewarding for this author because my six-part series on UFOs which appeared in Omni Magazine garnered the 1995 Donald E. Keyhoe Journalism Award bestowed by the Fund for UFO Research. A full report on the symposium, includ- ing speech synopses and photographs of the speakers, will appear in the August issue of the Journal. On other fronts, you will notice that this issue has been extremely tardy in appearing. Our apologies, even though most of the attenuating circumstances were far beyond our control. Each issue of the Journal passes through at least three hands before it arrives in your monthly mailbox, that of the editor, the assistant editor, Walt Andrus, and the local printer in Seguin. For rea- sons having nothing to do with government obfuscation, UFO conspiracies, or personal ineptitude, all three par- ties recently suffered various simultaneous delays, rang- ing from scheduling conflicts and dead hard drives, to stolen cars. Hopefully, the August issue will arrive on schedule. The ever-anxious are advised that membership guarantees you 12 issues of the Journal per year, no matter how much any monthly issue may be delayed in mailing. News is breaking at a remarkable pace. Within the last month alone, two new major hardback books have ap- peared: Breakthrough: The Next Step (HarperCollins, 297 pages, $23.00) by Whitley Strieber, and Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind: Alien Abduction, UFOs and the Conference at M.l.T. (Alfred A. Knopf, 476 pages. $25.00) by journalist C.D.B. Bryan, which we hope to review at length in future issues. Two new pa- perbacks were also on sale at the symposium: Searchers: A True Story of Alien Abduction by Ron Felber (St. Martin's, 213 pages, $4.99), of whom I've never heard, and A History of UFO Crashes: Documented Proof of UFO Visits to Earth by Kevin Randle (Avon, 276 pages, $5.50). Spaceships of the Pleiades, an expose of the Billy Meier phenomenon and photographs by Kal K. Korff, a late addition to the Seattle speaker list, is due out later this fall from Prometheus Books (hb, 550 pages, $25.95). In September, Feral House of Portland, Oregon, will publish The Controllers: Mind Control and its Role in the \"Alien \" Abduction Phenomenon, by Martin Cannon, an early version of which originally appeared in the Journal a few years back. Satirical novelist Christopher Buckley (Thank You for Smoking), son of conservative thinker William Buckley, is reportedly at work on a new novel which involves the abduction of a prominent (albeit fic- tional) talk-show host, an abduction which turns out to have been perpetrated by government agents. Fun and games! Again, we hope to have in-depth reviews of all of the above in future issues of the Journal. We are also eagerly awaiting the arrival of an inter- view with Ray Santilli by Phillip Mantle. Santilli di- rects Merlin Productions of London, and claims to have in his possession some 90 minutes of old Kodak b&w film portraying the Roswell wreckage and the subse- quent autopsy of \"alien\" corpses. Five still frames from the film are supposed to accompany the interview. Most recently, a poll conducted by the Scripps Howard News Service and Ohio University revealed that many Americans believe UFOs are real and that the government is involved in some sort of cover-up. Just over 1000 adults were surveyed. The question was \"Some Americans feel that flying saucers are real and that the federal government is hiding the truth about them from us. Do you think this is very likely, somewhat likely or unlikely?\" Forty-three percent answered unlikely, whereas 19 percent thought such a cover-up very likely, and 31 percent found it likely. (A total of 50 percent in the likely category.) Seven percent were undecided. The poll, conducted between June 12-26, had a margin of er- ror of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Belief in a government conspiracy varied considerably among age groups. Those who grew up exposed to tele- vision and other media featuring the UFO phenomenon tended to lean toward a government cover-up, whereas their underexposed elders did not.

The majority of the attendees welcomed the cool weather which was delightful com- pared with the hot temperatures some of us had been ex- posed to at prior symposia. If you drove to Seattle you had a rare opportunity to absorb the scenic beauty of the northwestern states. Headed by co-chairpersons, Larry and Marilyn Childs. and their committees, we extend our congratula- tions to them for one of the most enjoyable and success- ful symposia that MUFON has conducted in the past 26 years. At the conclusion to this exciting symposium, everyone was invited to make plans to attend our twenty- seventh annual affair on July 5, 6 and 7, 1996 at the Holiday Inn Four Seasons/Joseph H. Koury Convention Center in Greensboro, North Carolina. The 1996 sympo- sium co-hosts will be MUFON North Carolina and FSG (the Full Story Group in Greensboro). George Lund II will serve as chairman and Nick Summers, Coordinator.

Tilly is again an- nouncing that National UFO Awareness Week is sched- uled for August 12 through 20,1995. If you haven't al- ready contacted the management of your local shop- ping malls to reserve space, it is probably now too late. You still have time to set up displays, TV closed circuit with UFO videos, and an information table at your local library. Use your ingenuity to locate an appropriate site in your city for your exhibit. This is another opportunity to publicize your local organization and educate the public to the UFO enigma. NEW FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL The fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is now available for shipment. It is nearly a complete revision, with an entirely new format, com- pared to the third edition which had been accepted as the standard manual in the English-speaking nations. It is composed of 24 sections, some having several part num- bers, and authored by a vast contingent of outstanding UFO researchers and investigators. The 311-page man- ual is being delivered in a 3-ring loose leaf hardback notebook. Edited by Walter H. Andrus, Jr., the manual is re- spectfully dedicated to Jerold R. \"Ron\" Johnson and Dan C. Overlade, Ph.D., for not only their personal contributions to the manual, but for their individual dedication to resolving the UFO phenomenon. Due to the manual's size and weight, special mailing envelopes were purchased for shipping. The price to MUFON members has been set at $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling, whereas non-current members may obtain the new manual for $35 plus S3.50 for p & h. The same prices will apply in foreign countries. f PACE 24 NUMBER 327 JULY 1995"}]
