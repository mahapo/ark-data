FROM THE EDITOR Forget Ezekiel's Wheel, flying Roman shields, the Great Airship of 1897, WWHV'foo fighters,\" and 1946 Swedish reports of mystery rockets; for all practical intent and purposes, the public awareness of the UFO phenomenon began on a summer's day in June of 1947, when Boise, Idaho, businessman Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine, silvery, crescent (not disc), shaped objects skimming through the air over Mt. Rainier, Washington. Arnold described the objects as skipping like a saucer over water, an offhand remark that resulted in \"flying saucer\" headlines across the country. Like those other Cold War bugbears, the Atom Bomb and the Iron Curtain, so- called flying saucers, or UFOs, have been with us, for better or worse, ever since. This year, in fact, marks the fortieth anniversary of Arnold's landmark sighting. Coincidentally, the Fund for UFO Research, co-hosts of MUFON's 18th annual symposium, has its headquarters in Mt. Rainier, Maryland, a continent and nearly a half- century away from Arnold's original site. But synchronicity aside, we've had no shortage of reports similar to Arnold's. Include the contactees and abductees in the equation and the phenomenon has progressed substantially on one hand, thank you, while remainingas elusive of resolution as ever on the other. In a way, Arnold himself was a sort of microcosm of the larger picture we confront today. Like the phenomenon itself, he wouldn't quite stay put or comfortably pigeonholed. He could have sunk comfortably and quietly into oblivion. Instead he became inextricably entwined with UFOs, mainly through his subsequent association with the erratic Ray Palmer and the infamous Maury Island Hoax, which resulted in the death of two Air Force officers. Though not nearly as paramount, interpreting Arnold's checkered career has proved almost as difficult as making sense of UFOs themselves. Staff writer Greg Long's article, reprinted from the November 1981 issue of the Journal, should shed some light on the subject.

Kenneth Arnold's sighting on June 24, 1947, of nine crescent-shaped objects flying in formation near Mount Rainier is practically a cliche. It was the era of the Cold War, and Arnold, a private businessman and pilot, was convinced that what he had seen were guided missiles, perhaps of Russian origin. As he wrote later in The Coming of the Saucers (1952), a privately published book co-authored with science fiction writer and editor Ray Palmer, \"If, reasoning along patriotic lines alone, I had not reported my observations, I would have been rightfully considered disloyal to my country.\" A short time later, Arnold came to regret his act of patriotic duty. On the day of his sighting, he landed in Pendleton, Oregon, and finding the local FBI office closed, visited Noland Skiff, editor of the East Oregon/an. Arnold had no intention of seeking publicity and merely wanted an explanation of what he had seen. But shortly thereafter, a short news story of his sighting (which coined the term \"flying saucers\") went over the wires, and all hell broke loose. He was deluged by reporters, visited by military intelligence, and the longer his sighting went unexplained, was persecuted and ridiculed by disbelievers. Others began reporting strange objects in the skies, and although such aerial anomalies had been reported throughout history, the modern era of UFOs was born, and Arnold was permanently stigmatized as \"The Man Who Started It All.\" INTERVIEW I arrived ealier than expected at Kenneth Arnold's house in Meridian, Idaho, and while Arnold finished lunch with his wife of 40 years, Doris, I went :- • ~ v/ - /^/^^i':W / -/ - . .*,i -z.-y .-.-•!'.4 Kenneth Arnold through a stack of memorabilia that he left with me in the living room. There were newspaper clippings, magazine articles, photographs, a 1977 commemorative issue of the Easf Oregonian celebrating the 30th anniversary of Arnold's sighting. Each story that I skimmed rang with the same conviction and internal consistency — the man had seen nine strange objects; the sighting had occurred as originally reported; time had not eroded the reality of the event. When I finished with the last clipping, Doris sat down on the sofa, and I talked with her about my interest in UFOs. Arnold soon joined her. His gray hair contrasted brightly with the single tone of his blue shirt, dark pants, and black boots, and the white Western string tie clipped at his neck added the kind of detail I expected of this craggy- faced, 66-year-old man who had carved out his own livelihood from this part of the West. Arnold began by handing me a copy of the works of Charles Fort. Fort, a former newspaper reporter, published four books between 1919 and 1932 that chronicle countless unexplained phenomena, which include UFOs. These collected 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sightings have convinced Arnold that the U.S. Air Force had no explanation for his sighting, even though the military said that the nine objects were manmade or natural phenomena. \"I was convinced that what I saw might have been Air Force craft,\" Arnold said, \"I was astounded when I read Fort's books. There were similarities between what I investigated and what Fort had collected.\" As Arnold spoke, he revealed an unyielding, critical attitude toward science that ignores, ridicules, or attempts to rationalize away the \"damned,\" Fort's term for anomalous data that do not fit established scientific views. This attitude is readily understandable given the treatment he has received at the hands of the press and the skeptics. \"I wan't smart enough to dodge Noland Skiff. After the story of my sighting, reporters came out of the woodwork,\" he said. \"They'd ask a few questions, then go away and begin writing stories. The thing was, the stories were all different!\" Arnold was particularly angry about Dr. J. Allen Hynek, former Air Force consultant on UFOs for more than 20 years, and later director of the Center for UFO Studies. According to Arnold, Hynek told his that he (Hynek) had received from the Air Froce for analysis the wrong report made by Arnold of his sighting. On the basis of this report, Hynek concluded in the official Project Blue Book files that \"certain inconsisten- cies\" existed in Arnold's estimated size of and distance from the nine objects. Therefore, according to Hynek, the UFOs \"may have been some sort of known aircraft.\" Arnold was flabbergasted that Hynek had not gone back to the original report. When asked why not, Hynek said, \"Well, I was working for the Air Force.\" \"I wouldn't be surprised if Hynek was still working with the Air Force.\" Someone, at least, in the \"cloistered scientific society,\" Arnold believes, is debunking UFOs. In addition to the skepticism that greeted Arnold after he reported his sighting, there came the harrassment and, as he said, \"the nameless, faceless 4 people ridiculing me. I was considered • an Orson Welles, a fraud... I loved my country. I was very naive about the whole thing. I was the unfortunate goat who first reported them.\" Arnold took out a cigarette and lit up. \"Governments are more afraid than anything else of Joan of Arcs, religious saints, or 'phenomena' that cause their self-destruction.\" This fear, Arnold believes, seems to lie at the center of the official attitude in all countries concerning UFOs. Arnold learned this truth himself in the early days after his sighting when he was visited by Lt. Frank M. Brown and Capt. William Davidson of A-2 Military Intelligence. After discussing Arnold's sighting with him, the two officers went through his mail and selected letters from religious groups and organizations that had written Arnold for accounts of his experience. Capt. Davidson himself told Arnold that the government was aware of the effects of religious fervor, and that they did not want that to happen here. Arnold also soon learned how the Air Force, at first personable and friendly to him and eager to hear of his sighting, soon changed its attitude, perhaps because of the threat his experience posed to the government. The Knife and Fork Club originally invited him to speak on its lecture circuit at $100 a day. At his own expense, Arnold printed a booklet, \"The Flying Saucer As I Saw It,\" which he planned to use as a program guide for his audience. Air Force military intelligence learned of this offer and suggested that Arnold not publicize his experience since the Air Force was still working on its investigation of the sighting. Later, a letter arrived from the Knife and Fork Club, mysteriously withdrawing the offer. Although Arnold could not prove that the military was behind this change of heart, the implication is too strong to ignore. In 1950, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) bedeviled Arnold with red tape, which suggested that the government was .quite interested in Arnold's involvement with the subject of UFOs. When filing his taxes, Arnold presented receipts of all expenditures incurred during his private investigations. These would have been proof enough, he thought, to justify deductions for traveling expense. Not so, said the IRS. What was required was a detailed accounting of expenses entered into a record book, a standard the IRS strictly enforced. In this instance, no allowance for deductions could be made because of Arnold's faulty record keeping. Frustrated, Arnold threatened to call his attorney. Thirty-one years ago, $2,500 was quite a sum of money. In the end, up against the bureaucratic wall of government, Arnold concluded that it wasn't worth it; he paid up. THE STYMIE FACTOR The ridicule, the debunking, the harrassment — they all added up to the \"stymie factor,\" a term devised by Ray Palmer, a friend of Arnold for 30 years, in a lecture that Palmer gave in Chicago in 1977, two months before his death. Arnold played a tape of this lecture for me. \"Palmer had a dangerous theory,\" Arnold said. \"If it's absolutely true, it would have to be given to people like a piece of salami, one slice at a time over a period of 50 to 100 years.\" The metaphor of the salami had just the right air of absurdity to it to prepare me for the unexpected. In a dry, fragmented voice, Palmer mused upon the past and his involvement with UFOs. Among his experiences had been the \"stymie factor,\" or the element of ridicule that paralyzed and flustered, such as it did Arnold when newsmen made \"a mess\" of everything he said. In the case of Palmer, the \"stymie factor\" tongue-tied him in public debate with Willy Ley in 1950 and ridiculed him in a Life magazine article in 1952 that mocked the Shaver stories. It is these famous Shaver stories that form'the root of Palmer's \"dangerous theory,\" as Arnold put it. In 1943, a man by the name of Richard Shaver submitted a story to Palmer's Amazing Stories magazine. Shaver described a secret underground world in the Earth populated by beings (the Dero) who traveled in subterranean tunnels in craft that performed like flying saucers."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Supposedly, Shaver received information about this world through \"voices.\" Curiously, Palmer noticed that in a religious tome, Oahspe, which purports to be \"a history of the Earth and Heavens for the past 79,000 years,\" Ethereans, or astral entities, travel in vehicles along \"roadways\" that link levels or plateaus in a spirit world that exists from six inches to 100 miles above the surface of the Earth. The craft from both worlds, Palmer noted later, made the same peculiar fluttering motions as Arnold's UFOs sighted in 1947. After further thought and investigation, Palmer concluded that Shaver was contacting Oahspe-like astral entities who could obsess or possess people, even though Shaver insisted that the astral, spiritualist view was \"all wool\" and that the Derodid live under the surface of the Earth. Palmer added to these two literary souces a third element — the observation in physics that subatomic matter is real and solid, and since human beings are real and solid, then so must be their souls. And from the assumption that an invisible, spiritual, although solid, world coexists with the Earth, Palmer drew a startling conclusion: \"...I think that the flying saucers are the spirits of the dead.\" As the tape ended, I reflected on this \"dangerous theory.\" It aptly drove out the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the origin of UFOs, yet it seemed hollow and incomplete, mostly because of Palmer's damnably frustrating, purposely detracting statements that immediately followed: \"I don't say that; I don't say that at all...I don't ask anyone to believe what I said.\" Arnold removed the tape. Well, what did he believe? Palmer had said on the tape that Arnold had been adamant that what he had seen in 1947 were machines. I wondered if Kenneth Arnold was a \"nuts and bolts-er.\" He shrugged his somewhat bowed shoulders as he sat facing me in a wicker chair. \"I don't know what they are, but I'll tell you a story.\" THE ANECDOTES In the early fall of 1952 or 1953, Arnold was flying to San Francisco. The weather had been rough all day and he landed in Fall River Mills, California, when it was just beginning to snow. He was tying up his airplane when two or three fellows at the airport approached him and said that a plane had crashed near a ranch 6 miles out of town. Because of his experience in search and rescue, Arnold decided that he would help, and he accompanied about 20 other men to the ranch, arriving approximately 20 to 30 minutes after the plane had gone down. A farmer, his wife, and children testified that they had heard the sound of a plane before it suddenly went silent near a meadow. Outside, the family saw a globe of light the size of a basketball circling through the air near a draw. This light was followed by a second one moments before the rescuers arrived, which vanished, like the first, into the worsening snowstorm. The storm intensified so badly that rescue was impossible until the morning when an old Army training plane and the dead bodies of two college students were discovered. One man had died from a crushed head; the second man, practically cut in half, had crawled to the base of a tree where he had died, according to a doctor who visited the site, about 20 minutes after the crash. This would have been the approximate time that the farm family had seen the second light. Arnold added matter-of-factly that such lights are not unusual in his experience. People involved in search and rescue .have often seen globes of light associated with dying or dead people, and the same phenomenon has occurred at crash scenes in Idaho. As a boy of seven, he himself had seen, along with others, a globe of light in a room where the body of his great- grandmother lay in state. Spirits? Machines? Or something else? Arnold had his eighth sighting of UFOs in 1952 near Susanville, California. What Arnold saw were two apparent \"craft,\" one of which was totally transparent. \"They looked like something alive,\" he told me. \"I've had the feeling with these things that they 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"are aware of me, but they made no effort to come close.\" I asked him whether these UFOs, then, are some kind of lifeform that has the ability to assume the shape of a craft. He shrugged. At .best, what he saw were shaped like craft; but perhaps, he said, we are being visited in a mechanical sense. \"It's possible that intelligent life can make the journey from other galaxies. I wouldn't want to be selfish; I wouldn't deny that anything's possible.\" Arnold related stories of UFO sightings experienced by other individuals in the Northwest and in Idaho. One that was particularly intriguing concerned two disks that flew over Mount Adams, Washington, and crashed in the trees, leaving behind a gelatinous substance and a sulphurous ordor. The foreman of a construction crew building a road for the county at the base of the mountain scooped up a sample of the substance in a jar. The sample subsequently vanished into thin air. THE TAPES As the afternoon lengthened, Arnold brought out tape recordings of interviews he made with witnesses in the late 1940's of strange phenomena in the skies. Three of these interviews concern flying men. What was most striking about these interviews were the straight- forward, detailed descriptions of the objects, and the insistence of the witnesses that they had seen something undeniably real. The mundane context of the experiences also seemed noteworthy. In one case, a woman had been eating an orange and had gone to the kitchen sink to wash her hands when she thought she saw seagulls in the air, but looking more closely, noticed three men dressed in khaki suits and wearing helmets were flying in the sky at the height and speed of an airplane. In a fourth interview, an electronics and radar expert spoke with Arnold about mysterious .targets observed at the Landing Aids Experiment Station on the coastline in Arcata, California. These targets appeared on radar for 3 years, most 6 often in the summer, over the ocean, and travelled on 180° headings with little change of bearing at 30 miles an hour at 3,000 feet. The source of these targets was invisible to the naked eye and to aircraft sent aloft. In some cases, the targets split into two, which continued on 180° headings and then later merged together. Some targets came to a complete halt. The radar expert never found a satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon after extensive study and the painstaking elimination of all possibilities. Arnold pointed out to me that the radar station was later closed down after military interest in reports of \"mystery submarines\" in the area and of objects seen leaving the ocean. Arnold removed the last tape. What did all this add up to, I asked him, playing the student imploring the wise teacher. Arnold was prepared for that, and later I would consider my question very presumptuous. He handed me a card. One sentence on it read: \"Who but the Creator could have created so great a man as the unbeliever?\" Kenneth Arnold is certainly not a believer. Even if Ray Palmer's theory of the \"spirits .of the dead\" were true, Arnold knows that it wouldn't be accepted: \"The status quo of religion is so geared from an economic basis, a hypnotic basis, that no one wants a simple explanation.\" Arnold once sent President Dwight Eisenhower a telegram warning him that Americans were being visited by \"other worlds.\" Now, as the theories of the origin and purpose of UFOs have changed, so has Arnold, and he admits, at best, that \"it's a complicated sort of thing.\" Even though \"after 30 years, if there's proof [of UFOs] the government has it,\" Arnold believes that the world will probably never accept the reality of their existence since \"we are so engrossed in economic or selfish pursuits.\" In part, Arnold sees his own involvement in the UFO controversy in terms of his responsibility to fellow professional pilots. From the very beginning, he saw that many pilots would have liked to have stood up and recounted their own sightings of unexplained objects, but couldn't because of their jobs. Of those who did come forward, Arnold resented the criticism they received from \"mundane scientists.\" In turn, he felt that any criticism he received (until recently, he had flown since 1932) was a criticism of all pilots. Above all, Arnold disliked people impugning the professional integrity of pilots who place the utmost emphasis on safe travel and the security of their passengers. For these reasons, he spoke out on the subject. However, what Arnold was left with after his public involvement with UFOs was frustration and hurt. \"When it happens to you, you're completely helpless,\" he discovered. He spent $30,000 of his own money in his private investigations of UFOs and related phenomena. Out of that came strong clues that UFOs really exist, yet except for the rancher and the \"fellow pitching hay,\" no one listed to him. What puzzled him the most was what people did with his experience — ridicule it, criticize it, exploit it. Except for The Coming of the Saucers, which was privately printed and distributed, and the modest profits which went to support research into UFOs or to aid charity, Arnold never tried to write about his experiences or to profit from them. His attitude has been \"take it or leave it.\" However, for Arnold to say that he hasn't written about his experiences isn't quite accurate although it is true that he hasn't attempted to get rich off UFOs. Fare magazine published a series of articles written by him in its 1948 issues. In the spring issue, Arnold recounted the Mount Rainier sighting and his involvement in the Maury Island incident in Tacoma, Washington, in which Capt. Davidson and Lt. Brown died while transporting purported \"fragments\" of a UFO to Hamilton Field, California. In the summer issue, Arnold presented a number of his own investigations into unconventional fireballs in the Southwest; blue-green \"flashes,\" UFOs, and mystery fires in the Pacific Northwest; and river- dwelling purple \"globes\" in Canada. In the fall issue, he described \"phantom lights\" in Nevada. Additionally, some of Arnold's other cases have come to light (although sketchily) in the past few years, namely at the Fare magazine-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"sponsored First International UFO Congress in Chicago in 1977. As I was preparing to leave, Arnold showed me a film can containing a 16- mm movie that he had taken of a glowing \"cylinder\" over Idaho Falls, Idaho, on July 9,1966, at 2 p.m. Arnold said that the object in some ways looked like an atmospheric balloon. However, the object was traveling against winds of 45 to 80 mph blowing from the north-northwest. Despite the evidence for UFOs that he has collected, Arnold is in no rush to present it to the world. He considers that he has lived on \"hunches\" his whole life and the time simply isn't right. Besides, for Arnold the businessman, UFOs are a business proposition. Several years ago the National Enquirer showed interest in The Coming of Saucers. Arnold sent Bob Pratt a copy of the book for him to explore the possibility of serializing it. Arnold told Pratt that he would want the book run exactly as it was. Nothing should be deleted or added since the book presented exactly what he had experienced. Arnold also asked Pratt what his feelings were about UFOs. Pratt answered in complete serious- ness that UFOs were \"the greatest discovery in the history of planet Earth.\" And although Pratt did not make a formal offer on the book, he asked Arnold if he would consider $8,000. To Arnold, UFOS are, at least, the greatest aeronautical mystery in the history of planet Earth and a subject truly international in scope. He considered Pratt's figure highly unreasonable compared to the $250,000 that Arnold knew the Enquirer had paid one of President John F. Kennedy's mistresses to print her story. There is a clear lesson here for Arnold, who — if no one else— recognizes the value of his experiences. Thus, he would demand, at minimum, a return on his original investment from anyone who wrote the full story of Kenneth Arnold. This view isn't surprising given the personal history of Arnold. \"I've always been a do-er,\" he said, A resourceful, independent, rugged man, Arnold made it through the Depression, the toughest years of his life, built his own business, his own house, his own planes, and because of a fateful moment near Mount Rainier and his good conscience, was caught up in a series of events that have added up to, plainly, \"a pain in the neck.\" © 1981 Greg Long DIX--McGUIRE UPDATED By Leonard Stringfield & Richard Hall Both men are MUFON members. The former Air Force security policeman who claims to have witnessed a UFO incident on January 18, 1978, involving military police at McGuire AFB, New Jersey and adjacent Fort Dix, and New Jersey State Police, recently visited the Washington, D.C., area from overseas, where he is employed and met with the authors. The Fund for UFO Research sponsored a mini-conference to bring Stringfield from Cincinnati, Ohio, and have representatives of the Fund meet the witness to form their own impressions of his credibility. The witness, Jeff Morse (pseudonym), had contacted Stringfield in 1980 and described the alleged events, including a non-human- appearing body found near a deserted runway, allegedly shot by a Fort Dix MP, crated up and hauled away on a special aircraft from Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. Afterwards, Morse was flown to Wright-Patterson for a \"debriefing,\" instructed to remain silent, and shortly afterwards transferred overseas, while his colleagues who also witnessed the event were shipped to various parts of the world. A preliminary report on this incident (and many others) is included in Stringfield's 1982 \"Status Report No. Ill,\" and a detailed follow-up report appears in the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings.* Over several years, Morse remained incommunicado, surfacing briefly at times in response to Stringfield's communications. His silence, he said, was due to harassment and threats by officials as a result of talking to Stringfield. The Fund-sponsored mini- conference took place on January 24, 1987, at a large shopping mall in the Washington, D.C., area suburbs. In addition to the authors and Morse, Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee (Chairman of the Fund) and William H. Hall (electronics engineer and brother of Richard) were present. Dr. John B. Carlson, Univ. of Maryland astronomer and Fund Board Member, was to have been present, but a postponement caused a schedule conflict and he was out of town on the date of the conference. William Hall, a former technical consultant to the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), substituted since he had a number of things in common with Morse (including military police background and overseas duty stations) and would be able to judge Morse's credibility as he talked about his activities. NEW INFORMATION By prior arrangement, Morse remained incognito, using only his first name, but talked freely and responded to questions by Maccabee and William Hall. (The authors know his full name, employment status, past biography, etc.) During the questioning and review of the alleged incident, Morse filled in 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"details that were missing from his previous account, but offered no startling new information. A number of questions were clarified, and some new information (including claims that can be checked and proved or disproved) were offered. However, the authors were again impressed by Morse's straightforwardness and lack of embellishment. The most significant new information related by Morse, briefly, was his claim that on a trip to the United States to visit his family in October 1986 he had been \"detained,\" while in California, under obscure pretenses. Outraged, he filed a lawsuit against the California-based authority and notified Stringfield by letter that he would return to the United States in January 1987 for court appearances and, at that time would be willing to meet him and Dick Hall and a couple other well- trusted friends to discuss the matter. But, during Morse's layover in the States he could learn nothing about the cause or reason for his detainment, nor the identity of the source who dictated the \"pick up and hold\" order. His legal probes, for some inexplicable reason, had been stalled in a tangle of red tape. Among other things discussed at the mini-conference was the entire question of alleged harassment of UFO crash/retrieval witnesses, apparently in an attempt to intimidate them into silence. If Morse's story is credible, he is potentially an important witness who would tend to undermine the official cover-up. Unfortunately, this makes him vulnerable to retaliation (which may account for his detainment) and inhibits his ability to lead a normal life. Skepticism about crash/retrieval reports may be fully justified and entirely understandable on the part of UFO \"believers\" and \"disbelievers\" alike — unless they have met Jeff Morse or one of his many counterparts face-to-face. Morse has now provided many additional leads that we intend to check, and we will report our findings objectively as new information is obtained. AUTHENTIC? Meanwhile, the authenticity of the \"Incident Report\" form Morse supplied 8 to Stringfield (reproduced in the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings), obtained from a colleague still on active duty, has been disputed by the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) on the grounds that the style and terminology used — allegedly — does not follow proper Air Force style and is therefore probably a hoax. One of the key statements made by AFOSI was that pay grades (E-2, E-3...) were given instead of ranks (Corporal, Sergeant...) on the official form. Aside from the fact that Morse has claimed all along that this was a rough draft \"back room\" copy subject to review and revision, and that minor errors would be corrected by responsible officials before the final report was filed, the AFOSI statement is inaccurate. Pay grades, rather than ranks, are routinely filed in official Air Force reports. Two examples of this are an Air Force form reproduced in a November 6, 1985 Congressional hearing transcript (copy provided to MUFON) and an Air Force Serious Incident Report form on a 1973 case reproduced in Appendix A of Clear Intent by Fawcett and Greenwood (Prentice-Hall, 1984), labelled Figure 6. Participants of the mini- conference discussed ways of obtaining additional confirmation of the reported 1978 event, and varius initiatives will be undertaken to do so. Results will be reported periodically. As a result of the mini-conference, two additional persons (B. Maccabee and W. Hall) now have met and talked with Morse and can confirm that he is not a \"fairy tale\" or a figment of the imagination. They are also now in a position to help confirm or disconfirm his story.

In the summer of 1951, my great aunt, Mrs. L.O. Bauerlein, saw a UFO from the front porch of her ranch home on Benton Creek, six miles N.W. of Medina, Texas. It was about 2:00 a.m. on a hot and humid night in late July or early August, and Aunt Amie could not go to sleep. So, she slipped quietly out of bed, being careful not to wake Uncle Louie, and walked out onto the front porch. (This is a large open porch that runs the entire length of the house.) As she was admiring the clarity of the early morning sky, she spotted a small yellow light high above the . windmill tower. (The windmill is about 20° south of the corner of the porch.) The light was descending very slowly, swinging back and forth like a pendulum. The object came down in the front yard and stopped for a few seconds at a point approximately five feet off the ground and ten feet from her. It made no sound at all. It was a circular device about six to eight inches in diameter, and about one inch thick at the rim. A soft yellow glow came from the top and bottom of the thing, but the one inch thick rim area was bright orange in color. On top of the rim was a small intense white light that blinked on and off with a steady pulse. After hovering briefly, the object floated erratically toward the N.E. corner of the porch. Staying at about the same distance off the ground, the object turned left at the end of the porch and disappeared around the north side of the house. My aunt ran to the end of the porch just in time to see the object shoot straight up into the sky at fantastic speed and vanish in seconds. -Richard Bauerlein State Section Director Minnesota 103 Oldtowne Rd.

Moore (Under auspices of Focus, the monthly newsletter of the Fair-Witness Project, veteran UFO researcher and author William L. Moore recently released a 12-page packet of retrieved government documents pertaining to UFOs. Several of the documents deal with Special Studies Project MJ-12 and Project Aquarius, thought to be the supersecret government agency in charge of UFO investigations. They bear headings which range from \"Confidential\" to \"Top Secret/Eyes Only,\" and hail from sources as varied as the Air Force Office of Special Intelligence (AFOSI), the CIA, and a Presidential appointment calendar. Whether they are all legitimate remains to be seen. In the meantime, interested parties may contact Moore and FWP at 4219 W. Olive St., Suite 247, Burbank, CA, 91505.

Moore will also be the featured banquet speaker at the 18th annual MUFON Symposium to be held at American University in Washington, D.C., the weekend of June 26-28, 1987.) Over the past 6 l / 2 years, through aggressive means, I and ultimately several close associates have succeeded in establishing a cooperative relationship with a number of well- placed contacts within the American intelligence community. As a result, certain information has been made available which appears to pertain directly to our government's continuing involvement with the UFO phenomenon. Among this is both hard and filmed copies of documentation, several videotaped interviews and a number of useful leads which, have enabled us to independently uncover additional supporting information. The new information corroborates data provided us verbally during meetings with these contacts. Assurances have been given that add- itional information can be made available to us over the next several months. This information is being shared with the UFO community, and through them, ultimately, with the public at large, in anticipation that the resulting controversy will prove useful in further verifying the authenticity.of its contents and also in the hope that it will assist in setting the stage for additional information to come. Recently a number of rumors have circulated within the UFO community to the effect that some sort of major release of information on UFOs is imminent and that I am intimately involved with it. At this time it is only possible to confirm that a careful effort is currently underway which, if successful, could bring about the release of additional information through a major news media source in the near future. This project has presently reached a delicate juncture and no further specifics can be provided at this time. If for some reason our major effort should not prove successful, it remains nonetheless our intention to make available a lesser but still highly significant amount of information which is already in hand and currently under study. Once again, no further specifics can be provided at this time. Meanwhile, any assistance which can be provided us in further researching this material will be most appreciated. COPY ore OP ONE.

The new office, located at 2457 W. Peterson, Chicago, II. 60659, provides more space to house the Center's extensive files of UFO cases and its library of UFO materials. Founded by astronomer J. Allen Hynek in 1973, CUFOS was the first research facility established by a scientist and dedicated to the investigation, research, and analysis of UFO reports. CUFOS maintains a nationwide network of experienced field investigators who follow up on promising cases. The Center also publishes a bi- monthly magazine of UFO news and commentary, the International UFO Reporter, edited by Jerome Clark, and will soon resume publication of the scientific Journal of UFO Studies, to be edited by Michael Swords. The new office also houses the case files of the defunct National Investigations Committee of Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), founded in 1957 by USMC Major Donald E. Keyhoe (ret.). The NICAP files contain the original reports of many of the classic UFO cases of the 1950s and 1960s, including the Socorro (N. Mex.) landing of 1964 and the Betty and Barney Hill abduction.

Seguin, Texas 78155 10 IN OTHERS'WORDS By Lucius Parish With all the recent UFO reports and publicity about the subject, the NATIONAL ENQUIRER remains strangely silent. The April 28 issue contained a rehash of various historical sightings. At any rate, UFOs are \"news\" again, whether or not the ENQUIRER boards the bandwagon. The April 21 issue of WOMEN'S WORLD has a \"Whatever Happened to UFOs\" article quoting both skeptics and proponents. US for May 4 has an account of Whitley Strieber's experiences which led to the writing of COMMUNION, including details of incidents at his Manhattan apartment which have not been detailed in previous interviews. The May 11 issue of PEOPLE has a rather lengthy .article on' Strieber's COMMUNION, Hopkins' INTRUD- ERS and Kinder's LIGHT YEARS, giving details of the incidents chronicled in these books. Still more on Strieber and COMMUNION in Jerome ! Clark's article for the \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" column in April OMNL In the May issue, Clark returns with a synopsis of the \"Kathie Davis\"story from INTRUDERS, as well as additional information relating to Budd Hopkins' abductions research. Those who have been obtaining the series of booklets on UFO history by Loren Gross will want to know that two additional booklets are now available. Copies of UFOs: A HISTORY, 1950; August-December and UFOs: A HISTORY; 1951 may be obtained from Gross for $6.00 each. His address is: 690 Gable Drive - Fremont, CA 94538. All of the booklets in this series are valuable contributions to our understanding of the \"modern\" (post- 1947) UFO situation. The series will apparently continue and it will be .interesting to see how many booklets are required to cover the flap year of 1952! Rumors abound concerning UFO books and manuscripts. In addition to the forthcoming book by Timothy Good, ABOVE TOP SECRET, Wendelle Stevens should soon have four or five new titles available, ranging from UFO crash/retrieval reports to more UFO abducitons in South America. Richard Hall's SPACESHIPS OF SPECTERS? has reportedly been submitted to Random House for consideration. Philip Imbrogno and the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek were preparing a manuscript dealing with the many sightings in the Northeastern states and this will apparently be published. Thomas E. Bullard is at work on a huge analysis of UFO abduction reports which will be made available (in one format or another) by the Fund for UFO Research. The Fund will also have Robert Neeley's chronology of' the 1896-97 \"airship\" reports. Dr. David Jacobs is at work on a second book.

The following column will be a continuing feature in the MUFON UFO Journal Forty Years Ago-June 1947: Prior to Kenneth Arnold's highly publicized sighting there were more than 27 reported sightings of over 100 UFOs for the period of June 1st thru the 23rd. On the 23rd Pacific Coast veteran pilot, Richard Rankin, observed 10 disc- shaped craft over Bakersfield, CA, doing about 400 MPH. That was at 2 PM, about 24-hours before Arnold's report. Rankin, with 7000 hours in the air, though the discs were 9000 feet up. On the morning of the 24th, a Portland, OR, prospector — working in the Cascade Mountain Range in Oregon — observed a group of five or six \"round, metallic-looking discs\" as they banked in the sun about 1000 feet overhead. They were about 30 feet in diameter. While the discs were overhead, Johnson's compass weaved wildly back and forth. The discs were in view for about 60 seconds. Later than afternoon, at 2:58 PM, another highly experienced pilot, Kenneth Arnold, observed nine, bright disc-shaped craft while flying near Mt. Rainier, Wash. Arnold clocked the discs at an estimated speed of 1200 MPH. Two minutes after Arnold's sighting, Sidney B. Gallagher of Mineral, Wash., (20 miles southwest of Mt. Rainier) observed nine disc-shaped craft moving across the sky at a high rate of speed. Following Arnold's sighting the news outlets around the world were full of flying object reports, some from highly credible witnesses. Lt. E.B. Armstrong, U.S. Army Air Corp was flying an F-51 30 miles northwest of Lake Meade, Nevada, on the 28th at 1:15 PM. He observed five or six disc-shaped craft, 1 three feet in diameter, flying in tight formation. At 9:20 PM the same day, four U.S. Army 12 Air Corp officers at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, (Capt. W.H. Kayko, Capt. J.H. Cantrell, Capt. Redman, and 1st Lt. T. Dewey).observed a bright light zig-zagging across the sky and making 90-degree turns at high rates of speed. They watched the light for about 25 minutes. On the following day at 1:15 PM, four witnesses, including Dr. C.J. Zohn and Curtis C. Rockwopd — both missile experts at the Naval Research Laboratory, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, observed a large silver disc or sphere moving horizontally at high speed. It had no protruding surfaces such as wings. On the same afternoon, two U.S. Army Air Corp pilots. at Hamilton Field, CA, reported two disc-shaped craft trailing a P-80 aircraft and following it toward Oakland. On June 30th, Lt. William G. McGinty, a U.S. Navy pilot, was flying near Williams Air Base, AZ, when he sighted two gray, circular craft about eight feet in diameter, moving \"at \"inconceivable\" speed, dive straight down from 20,000 feet to ground level and disappear from view. In June 1947, some fifty reports were made of silvery balls flying in the skies of Hungary. And, according to pilots of the Norwegian Air Lines, missile-like objects had been clocked flying as fast as 6700 MPH, moving as high as 25,000 feet and as low as treetop level. The 6700 MPH clocking was witnessed and timed by the President of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association. Thirty Years Ago-June 1957: Something very strange was going on in space 70 miles above the southern end of New Zealand's South Island. Puzzled scientists ruled out the Soviet earth satellite. Dr. Michael Gadsen, an authority on auroral activity, said mysterious objects had been observed on International Geophysical Year radar screens. The IGY radar has a maximum range of 1200 miles into outer space. He said the objects had been running about, first traveling north, then doubling back on their path. Gadsen said he believed the objects \"could be a little man steering around up there or ionized particles rushing about. The fact is, we don't know what is going on up there, it's something new. * * * Twenty Years Ago-June 1967: On the night of the 13th, Mrs. Gertrude Purdue was sitting on the front porch of the .family home in Summerdale, PA. Donald (Butch) Purdue, Jr., 23,'was stretched out on the ground across the driveway. Suddenly a rotating egg- shaped craft as big as a car approached their home. The object stopped in mid- air and hovered overhead. A brilliant light radiated ,from the object, bathing the house and lawn in a eerie glow. Caught in the glare, Mrs. Purdue found she couldn't move: She was holding the porch banister and tried to get up, but she couldn't. Butch tried to get up from the grass and also discovered he couldn't move. He weighed 260 pounds and was six-feet 'two inches tall. But as soon as the light shown he just couldn't lift his arms or legs. The craft was right over him. Then as suddenly as it had come, the craft zoomed up into the starry night sky — giving off a high-pitched whining sound — and vanished like a streak. As its glow receded and went out, strength and mobility poured back into the Purdues. For the Purdue family the terrify ing-episode was but one of three they experienced during the week of June 11-17 — a week that heralded a fantastic summer-long explosion of UFO sightings in central and south- central Pennsylvania. + * ik- Ten Years Ago-June 1977: Dale Schexnaider, 26, had spent the day fishing and swimming at Cotile Lake, LA. It was about 11 PM on the 17th. Suddenly he became aware of an ultra- low frequency humming sound. He looked up and hovering motionlessly above the tree line was a disc-shaped craft with a bubble-like top. He estimated the craft to be 75 feet across and 50 feet above him. Two children with him also saw the disc. The craft began to glow and shown a bright \"studio-type\" floodlight on the threesome. It then directed several deep-blue rays of light at them. They appeared to strike them in the solar plexus. It was an intense, electric, silver-blue thin beam, three to five of (continued on page 14)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Clarkson & Johnson RECENT SIGHTINGS (Note: We are releasing this report in the hopes that publicity about the sighting will encourage others who may have witnessed the same event to come forward and provide additional information.

Clarkson, (533- 7587), the MUFON Field Investigator, in Aberdeen, Washington, or Donald A. Johnson (822-6609), the Washington State Director for MUFON, in Kirkland, Washington. People who wish to report a UFO sighting are urged to call the UFO Reporting Center, (206) 722-3000, a 24-hour number, in Seattle.) Two men on a camping trip sighted what they described as a \"manta ray\" shaped UFO on Saturday night (March 7, 1987) near Alder Lake, about two miles west of the town of Elbe on the road to Mount Rainier. The object made no sound and passed very low over their pickup truck, stopped, and without turning reversed direction and appeared to chase the witnesses' truck east' down Highway 7. .When it was close behind and above the pickup truck, the UFO veered off sharply to the north and accelerated very fast, over the hilltops, and out of sight. The entire incident lasted about three minutes. The two men had left their favorite fishing spot and were on their way to the small community of Elbe to pick up some groceries and, firewood for camping out. The weather had been clear all day and at approximately 7:30 p.m., they were not far from Alder Lake and nearing the town when they first spotted the lights over the highway ahead of them.  ' • \"I looked ahead and saw two big white lights,\" said the driver \"They were right over the highway ahead of us...I thought that it was a plane that was going to come down on the highway.\" As they drove toward the object a bright red light became visible beneath the white lights. The driver pulled over next to a guard rail and the passenger jumped out of the vehicle to watch. As the driver was getting out of the vehicle, the passenger observed the object roll slightly in a counter-clockwise direction and then right itself. The driver noticed at this point that a few other cars passed them: \"I saw that the cars were going slow. I don't know if it was because I pulled over or if they saw what we saw.\" Both witnesses stated that the object passed directly overhead at a very low altitude, estimated by them as no more than 200 feet. The two men, interviewed separately, had similar descriptions of the object. The driver stated that its silhouette was like a \"flounder\" fish. The passenger described it as a \"manta ray\" or \"stealth aircraft\": \"When it went over I saw that it had a bright red light in the center. It wasn't blinking or anything. It had a small bright light on the back. When I saw it overhead the first thing that I thought of was a stealth aircraft or a manta ray.\" NO HELICOPTER The two white lights on the objects were reported to be very bright. \"It looked just like the landing lights of a 747 or a large aircraft,\" said the driver. \"They were like the spotlights on a tank that I saw in Vietnam,\" reported the passenger, age 36. \"The part that amazed me was when they dimmed. They dimmed to a point where it looked like they were going to go off.\" The dimming of the two bright white lights allowed them to see the red light and the other white \"tail\" light. Although the lighting configuration Ret. Capt. Nash on the object was similar to that of a helicopter, the men contend that the object made no sound despite its low altitude. In describing the silhouette of the object, both stated that it was difficult to see because of the brightness of the lights, but they were certain that it did not have the wings or body of a conventional aircraft. After the UFO passed over the truck it continued moving slowly down the road. The driver and passenger got back in the truck because the driver wanted to drive down the road to a campground so he could pull completely off the road. The passenger was still watching it out the rear window. After the object travelled about a half mile down the road, it suddenly stopped, and without turning around, reversed direction to follow the witnesses' truck. \"My God, it's coming after us,\" the passenger said. The driver looked back and saw that the UFO was approaching at a much greater speed than when it had first passed over their vehicle. The driver sped up to get to the campground. Just before the UFO reached the truck it veered off to the north. \"I looked back and...it took off to my left over the hills. The highway runs at the edge of the lake just below the line of hills. There's heavy woods on the hills. It took off at a very high rate of speed and that's the last we saw of it.\" The witnesses, age 42 and 36, were interviewed separately by James Clarkson of Aberdeen, Washington, a police officer and investigator for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), headquartered in Seguin, Texas. He described the men as sober and somewhat reluctant to report the incident. It is his opinion that both men were trying to relate exactly what had occurred to them. Both witnesses admitted that they were scared by the experience\" but that they were also intensely curious. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"They both freely admit they don't know what it was they saw. *** (The following report was submitted by retired Pan American Airline Captain William B. Nash, Sr. Nash, it might be remembered, was behind the controls of a Pan Am DC-4 approaching Norfold, VA, on July 14th, 1952, when he and Second Officer William Fortenberry spotted six red lights streaking toward their aircraft at a slightly lower altitude. \"Their shape was clearly outlined and evidently circular,\" Nash reported. \"The edges were well-defined, not phosphorescent or fuzzy in the least.\" The six were soon joined by two similar objects which appeared from underneath Nash's plane. In echelon formation, the lights of all eight winked out then back on. They disappeared in the West at a high rate of speed, gracefully arcing upwards, their lights going out one by one. Nash later estimated the objects were 100 feet in diameter and traveling at a speed of approximately 12,000 mph. They were in view an approximate 15 seconds. Following the report radioed by Fortenberry, the two observers were interviewed at 7 AM the following morning by Air Force personnel, only one of whom was in uniform. Flashing ID cards and badges, the other four represented themselves as Special Investigators, USAF. Project Blue Book classified the sighting as \"unexplained.\" Howard astronomer Dr. Donald H. Menzel, in lengthy correspondence with Nash, proposed and discarded a series of explanations, including fireflies trapped between panes in the cockpit windows (!). Eventually he settled on ground light sources distorted by haze and the ubiquitous temperature inversion. The following sighting was made by Nash Sr. and William B. Nash, Jr., age 14, outside their Fort Meyers, PL, home the night of February 1st, 1987. The weather was clear, with no visible clouds.)

Top of drawing is South. straight up. I looked and saw what he was looking at It was' a large cloudlike \"Something\" shaped like the accompanying ..drawing, which was moving steadily on 'a directly North to South heading. It appeared to be a thin cloud, but it kept its form and there was no movement of its \"surface.\" We do not recall seeing the stars through it. Its light intensity was that of a medium intensity star. Had we not beenk looking up, we would not have seen it. There was not enough'light contrast with the sky to attract one's attention. There was no sound. The general sound level was distant auto- traffic. It was large. It subtended an angle from the viewer's viewpoint of about 15 degrees. It appeared about as large as the World's largest bomber would appear if it were flying at about 2000 feet. There was no way of guessing its altitude. If it were, a bomber at 2000 to 3000 feet, its speeed looked to be about 250 miles per hour. Of course the \"something\" could have been much higher and therefore travelling at a much greater speed. We watched it go from straight overhead, over our roof and eventually disappear into the bright lights in the distance over Fort Myers Beach, all the time keeping its precise shape. We had moved around alongside of our house to watch it until it was lost to view. Though it was cloud-like it seemed slightly luminous. There was a !4 Moon or less, about 25 degrees above the horizon in the West. A check with the local aviation weather bureau confirmed that there was no inversion, — that there was a linear scale going up to 39,000 feet. This was also true of Jacksonville, Tampa, and Key West weather reports. My wife, Eva-Marie, wonders if \"our visitors\" have developed a way to become almost invisible in our atmosphere, thus accounting for a decrease in reported sightings. Wonder what took them so long? LOOKING BACK, Continued them, centered on their bodies. The three observers could hardly move. In a few moments their entire bodies glowed in the eerie blue aura. After about ten seconds all of the lights vanished instantly. Then the craft moved away and the humming sound faded. \"It's an incredible feeling to see something like that. You can sense the intelligence. The cultural shock right at first is the most evident thing,\" Schexnaider said. \"Your values change. You realize there's someone out there with incredible technology. It's got to change you.\" Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J.Greenwood INTENT HJttlUUJHL THE GOVERNMENTCOVERUP OF THE UFO EXPERIENCE about UFOs and why wont it tell us? With a foreword by Dr. J. Allen Hynek"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"PARANET CLASSIFICATION By James J. Speiser In the April 1987 issue of the Journal, Don Berliner outlines a method of prioritizing UFO sighting reports, by calibrating Dr. Hynek's Strangeness/Probability matrix to types of sightings and evidence presented, each on a scale of one to ten, then multiplying the two factors to obtain a \"sighting coefficient.\" He proposes this as a method of concentrating \"our efforts on those reports which may contain information of long-term value...\" I quite agree with Mr. Berliner's objectives, and believe there is merit to the system he has suggested. My organization, Paranet, has for the past year used a similar system for weighing UFO reports as a method of determining usefulness. The only major cosmetic difference in our system is that a scale of one to five is used, and the two ratings are not multiplied together. Our system, called the Hynek Rating System, is calibrated as follows: Strangeness Factor Si - 55: SI: Explainable or explained. S2: Probably explainable with more data. S3: Possibly explainable, but with elements of strangeness. S4: Strange; does not conform to known principles. S5: Highly strange; suggests intelligent guidance. Probability Factor: PI - P5: PI: Not Credible or Sound P2: Unreliable; smacks of hoax P3: Somewhat credible or indeterminate P4: Credible; Sound. P5: Highly Credible; leaving almost no doubt. The Hynek Rating of a class is stated as the combined S and P factors, for example S4/P2; except cases that have been explained need only be stated as Si. The S factor of a report is simply a statement of the report's prima facie departure from known principles, regardless of the rating agent's propensity to believe what is reported. Similarly, the P factor is a representation of the soundness of all evidence presented to support the case, including eyewitness testimony, photographs, radiation readings, etc. Ideally, it should not be influenced by the S factor. There is a temptation to modify the P factor inversely with the S factor; that is, the more far-out the report, the less \"credible\" it becomes. This is unavoidable with certain cases, such as when a witness reports seeing a flying saucer with the letters \"UFO\" emblazoned on the side. Generally, however, the two factors should be judged independently of one another. ADVANTAGES The most obvious functional difference is that this system is more subjective. It is not dependent on categorization based on specific elements of the case; rather it calls for a more general judgement of how useful the various elements are to the advancement of our knowledge. Saying that any CE-III is an S8 (under Berliner's system) hasn't told us much; it has simply redefined the terms. Other possible advantages of our system include: 1) Easier to commit to memory; more compact. An investigator or organization can assign a Hynek rating to a case practically off the top of their head. 2) Easily absorbs new types of sightings, or new categories of evidence. As Berliner points out, crash/ retrievals and abductions are not accounted for under his system, and would be less easy to categorize. 3) Separate factors have more meaning than one coefficient. Under Berliner's system, how does one judge a \"24?\" Is it a 3X8, a 6X4, ...? Stating a case as S3/P4 yields more immediate information than \"12,\" which becomes redundant and rather akin to multiplying house numbers. 4) Greater consistency. Under Berliner's system, the Socorro, NM sighting appears to be nearly twice as valuable as the recent Cash/Landrum case. I think most would agree that the Cash/Landrum case has much more going for it in terms of overall evidential, value. 5) The system is dynamic. A case's Hynek rating can and will change with the input of new evidence, correlation with other sightings, the confession of a hoax, etc. This continuous state of change reflects the dynamic nature of Ufology itself, and can serve to increase interest in cases from prior years that may merit renewed examination. 6) It is likely that no two organizations or investigators will assign the same Hynek rating to a particular case. While such disparity can be confusing, it can also inspire more public discussion in search of equilibrium. It can also lead to a \"rating of the raters;\" for example, an agency that consistently assigns higher ratings may be perceived by some as being \"too credulous.\" Similarly, rating cases towards the explainable end of the scale can quickly get one branded as \"too skeptical.\" 7) More correctly indicates the anomalistic nature of the phenomenon. The highest score on Berliner's K/U system was 27 out of a possible 100, and he is correct when he asserts, \"This seems to make it clear that there is a severe lack of reports which could be used to convince scientists, legislators and the general public that we are dealing with something so unusual that it deserves immediate attention.\" This is perhaps due to the high end of each scale being calibrated to unusual, ambiguous, or non-existent events/evidence. For example, he assigns CIO to \"live television.\" Under that criteria, there is probably no hope 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"of ever proving the existence of ball lightning, either. Under the ParaNet/Hynek system, several cases qualify for the highest rating, S5/P5, as we shall see. (By the way, 1 question Berliner's implication that professional photography has more evidential weight than that of amateurs. I should think professionals would be more adept at techniques that could fool the unwary investigator.) As Mr. Berliner says, the proof is in the pudding. Below are some of the cases he presents in the article, with the corresponding Hynek rating as assigned by ParaNet. (I'm certain many will disagree with these ratings. They certainly are not etched in stone, and the system is not the sole property of ParaNet. Others are free to assign their own Hynek ratings, and perhaps some meaningful dialogue will ensue.) I, too, invite comment on this system, and perhaps some synthesis of the two systems can be worked out. CASE EXAMPLES 1947 Kenneth Arnold, Mt.

This eerie story, laid out so carefully and logically by Budd Hopkins in building-block fashion, is the ultimate refutation of the simplistic skeptical view that UFO witnesses are religious seekers of \"saviors from space.\" What the abductees (literally uicfims of abduction by alien-appearing beings) have experienced has been frightening and confusing; not at all anything desirable or pleasant. The experiences have been nothing that they sought, and certainly nothing that gave them any comfort. If his thesis is stated bluntly, it sounds like the banner headline of a supermarket tabloid. No doubt there will be many people (not only the established knee-jerk skeptics) who write it off as just that: sensationalism 16 for its own sake or to \"sell newspapers.\" But they will be wrong. Hopkins clearly understands what the results of his investigations and research sound like, but he has the courage to state them anyway. The important thing is that he has objectively (if reluctantly at times, like many of us) followed the evidence where it leads. He is an empirical investigator in the best scientific tradition. Here we have an artist and sculptor who acts \"more scientifically than the scientists\" when it comes to UFOs, and his techniques and ethical principles in handling the abductees are admirable. Anticipating the skeptical reactions his work will evoke, Hopkins forces the reader to listen to the witnesses and vicariously experience the emotional content of their stories, and to \"see for themselves\" as the stories — and supporting evidence — unfold. As a result, the reader at each stage is forced to come up with a better explanation if he or she. can. His method and expository style is sensible, methodical, and thoughtful. THERAPY Then there is his role as a therapist, as many or most abductees need. Here, too, he acts responsibly and with care for the feelings of the abductees and the traumatic effects of their experiences. Too many laymen attempt to be \"therapists,\" probably with the best intentions in the world, but may do more harm than good. Hopkins has the good sense to consult professional psycholgists, psych- iatrists, and medical experts for guidance. The abduction phenomenon is now out of the closet, and we will all have to come to grips with it in one way or another. As Hopkins concludes,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"either it is an extraordinary universal psychological phenomenon heretofore totally unrecognized, or the abductees : essentially are reporting real events. Neither Government nor religion is likely to supply the answers. The intervention of psychologists and other behavorial scientist professionals on a large scale is sorely needed, especially if the average citizen turns to \"authorities\" for an explanation. Hopkins' findings are that manifestly alien beings are studying human reproductive processes and apparently engaging in \"genetic experimentation\" in an offensively personal and intrusive way. He carefully speculates on what the ultimate purposes might be. Most importantly for the average person's understanding and assimilation of the bizarre, disturbing, and even frightening information he presents, Hopkins concludes that there is no evidence of overt hostility or evil intentions. Instead, the supposed aliens are psychologically different and a mutual learning experience is in progress. The aliens have intervened in family lives, across time and generations, revisiting particular \"victims\" many times. They do so, he suggests, because we have something they need. This book is not for the squeamish; many people won't want to hear what he has to say. Nevertheless, whether we like it or not, the presentation is ultimately very convincing. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a profound book; not only one of the most instructive books on the potential meaning and significance of UFOs, but also possibly a giant contribution to human enlightenment. In a sort of reverse way, it may also be an important statement of what is good and what should be cherished about being human. BETTY HILL'S 'LANDING SITE By J.P. Oswald The recent appearance in the MUFON UFO JOURNAL of three commentaries regarding Mrs. Betty Hill and her \"landing site\" (W. Webb, March 1986; Dr. J.K. Long, June 1986; and W. Laporte, August 1986) prompts me to write, inasmuch as the location of this alleged UFO activity falls within the small geographical area of my investigative research, and since I, too, have had firsthand experience with Mrs. Hill. In fact, it was I who chose the exact place of what has subsequently become known as the \"landing site.\" Betty had suggested to me that we attempt to contact the Aliens. I agreed, saying that I knew of a good place; owing to its relative remoteness, view of the sky, convenience to her routine travels, and proximity to sites of reliably reported close encounters. But I also (probably unwisely) told Betty in all candor of some of the UFO activity from that immediate area. ATTEMPTED CONTACT She readily agreed to the specific site, at the intersection of a gravel road and a railroad, and we set the time for attempted contact at 8:00 p.m., E.S.T. on Feb. 15, 1974. Betty and I were there alone that night at 8:00 p.m.; as one could predict, nothing happened. Throughout a lengthy period following the attempted contact, Betty gave me descriptions of the numerous sightings (to me all very questionable) she was making near the soon-to-be \"landing site,\" and finally I returned to that place on 4/15/77 with her and others including a military officer. To my amazement, Mrs. Hill was by then seeing as landed UFOs pole lights, and so forth which is precisely the sort of lights mentioned by W. Webb in the account of his 1978 outing with Betty. Thus, based on my total experience with Mrs. Hill, I wish to express my concurrence with Mr. Webb's general assessment for the evident reality of the Hills' original encounter and for a probable casual relation between that and the unfortunate developments under discussion. One should further understand that apart from the towering fiction of this \"landing site\" there definitely exists an astonishing concentration of reliably reported close encounters — not landings — in the New Hampshire seacoast (Exeter, N.H.) region (i.e., context of the \"landing site\"). And despite this latter fact, the rate of local reporting, exclusive of Hill and associates, has been relatively slow from about 1975 until the present. Nevertheless, it would not be unreasonable to think that persistent nocturnal UFO hunting in the Exeter vicinity could be rewarded with an authentic sighting. Since I moved here in 1969, I have made one sighting of a proabably, nocturnal UFO light event. OTHER REPORTS The credibly reported UFO events from the New Hampshire seacoast region feature close encounters at night with apparent nuts-and-bolts flying objects of classical body types (mostly disks). According to my analysis the concentration of these good local UFO sightings results as a natural consequence when they conduct their surveillance of the nearby Strategic Air Command Base (i.e., Pease AFB at Newington, N.H.). For this purpose they fly low, beneath radar coverage, and at night to avoid detection as they wait under the Pease landing pattern, which passes almost directly above Exeter, N.H. My investigation at Exeter of the many significant close encounter cases 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"'LANDING SITE', Continued gives no indication that the UFOs are in any wise not \"seeable.\" And for whatever PK effects that may have been demonstrated, which one can presume does not include the instant creation of a commercial airliner with crew and passengers, I fail to see why we should seriously consider that Betty Hill and her friends or acquaintances are producing Alien spaceships in East Kingston, N.H., through feats of aberrant psychology. Are we to think that these super-intelligent Aliens have their schedules preempted by Mrs. Hill? To me it is infinitely more reasonable to think that if Betty and her associates ever actually see a real UFO it is simply one from the sample of those that have for years been reported near Exeter by reliable people. Regarding Mr. Laporte's discussion, again, I would raise the question of what is actually seen through Mrs. Hill's \"window,\" and remind him of the history at Exeter, with its relatively slow sighting rate for recent years. Finally I would emphasize the Pease'Connection as opposed to a supposed Quartz connection. The State of N.H. (N.H. Dept. of Resources and Economic Development, Concord, N.H. 03301) has issued various publications relating to the geology of the N.H. seacoast. If some of these are not easy to interpret it is clear that the Exeter Diorite is not \"a bed of quartz,\"and one should read Clinton-Newbury Fault Zone rather than Clinton-Newburg Fault. Note that the Exeter diorite pluton consists in substantial portions of only a few percent of quartz (Novotny and Meyers, 1969, for the State of N.H.; The Geology of the Seacoast Region, N.H., pp. 16-17 and Table 7). In my opinion, geological faults, quartz, and earthquakes have no importance for the understanding of the Exeter, N.H. area UFO activity. © 1987 J.P. Oswald MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN, TX 78155 THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant JULY 1987 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, moving from Gemini into Cancer, sets in the WNW about 9:30 PM early in the month. Shining feebly at magnitude +1.8, the red planet becomes increasingly difficult to glimpse at dusk. Use binoculars. Saturn, in Ophiuchus, remains bright at magnitude +0.2. It lies south at dusk and progresses westward after dark. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus rises only three-quarters of an hour before the Sun in mid-July and onjy half an hour before by month's end. The brilliant planet (magnitude -3.9), however, is so low in the ENE and so near the Sun that binoculars may be required to find it. Jupiter, in Pisces, dominates the morning sky at magnitude -2.4. The planet giant rises in the east shortly after midnight in midmonth and is high in the SE at dawn. The last-quarter Moon is near it on the 18th. Saturn sets in the WSW about 3 AM in mid-July. Meteor Shower: Conditions are excellent this year for the Delta Aquarids as there is no Moon interference during maximum on the morning of July 29. The expected rate is about 20 meteors per hour before dawn. Some members of the shower can be seen from around mid-July to mid-August. Although these \"slow\" meteors with long trails radiate from Aquarius in the south, observers should search the whole sky; the streaks of light do not appear until they are some distance away from the radiant point. Moon Phases: First quarter - July 4 Full moon - July 10 Last quarter - July 17 New Moon - July 25 € O The Stars: While the constellations of spring retreat into the west, the Summer Triangle ascends higher in the SE after nightfall. The stars in the triangle are Vega, Deneb, and Altair. The southern sky during July features two prominent patterns, Scorpius the Scorpion and Sagittarius the Archer. The farther south you live, the higher this pair of constellations gets. Scorpius is fairly easy to see; it was described in June's sky.
