FROM THE EDITOR When what was rumored to be a siipersecret F-19 Stealth fighter crashed in California July 11, 1986, the Air Force went into action, clamping down security and sealing off the area of the crash site, near Bakersfield. The blackout even extended up to 8500 feet, • as a \"national security\" zone was declared off-limits to -civilian aircraft (New York Times, 7-15-86). Could a similar scenario occur in the case of something even more \"classified\" than Stealth technology? Barry Greenwood examines just that possibility next month in an exciting expose of Project Moon Dust. We'll also have all our regular departments, along with up to date coverage of recent case in Brazil and Petaluma. Stay tuned. In this issue Walt Andrus reports on both the recent East Lansing, Michigan, MUFON Symposium and the 23rd National UFO Conference. We also have several sighting reports, another Bentwaters update and the latest UFO News 'N' Views.

The purpose of this article is to share an overview and the highlights of the symposium for those who were unable to attend. Judging by the numerous favorable responses by attendees, Dan Wright and his host committee Michigan MUFON fulfilled their promise to present the highest quality conference possible. The facilities at the Kellogg Center were outstanding, which included not only the beautiful auditorium, dining rooms, meeting rooms, but the attractive and reasonably priced hotel style rooms. Prearranged shuttle service was provided from the Capital City Airport, AMTRAK, and Greyhound-Indian Trails stations in East Lansing. Electronic and printed press coverage exceeded expectations, although the response is never predictable. Television coverage was provided by WLNS, Channel 6, Lansing; WNEM, Channel 5, Saginaw; WILX, Channel 10, Lansing; WOTV, Channel 8, Grand Rapids; CBC (Canadian Broadcast Company) Tbrhorito; and NCTV (National College TV Network) New York. Radio interviews both live and taped were handled by WKAR, AM/FM East Lansing; WICC-AM, Straford, Conn.; and the ABC Radio Network, New York. In addition to United Press International (UPI) the following newspapers conducted interviews and published articles: Detroit Free Press; Lansing State Journal (Gannett), and State News, (Michigan State University). National TV coverage with news announcements occurred on both NBC and CBS on Friday morning. A majority of the featured speakers were present for the Press Conference on Friday afternoon. Award Recipient Marge Christensen A delightful get-acquainted reception was enjoyed at the Centennial Room and was followed at 8 pm by a tour of the Michigan State University Cyclotron. Since M.S.U. was in the process of building a larger and more powerful cyclotron, the members of the tour had the rare opportunity of not only observing the present cyclotron in operation, but a hands-on exposure in the construction state to the components that will become the larger cyclotron. The tour was conducted by two professors — a husband and wife team, who are directly involved in the operation. The symposium was opened with greetings from the symposium and host chairman Dan Wright and welcome by Walt Andrus, International Director. Formal recognition was bestowed upon Marge Christensen thru the dedication of the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium Proceedings for her outstanding leadership and public relations endeavors. Since copies of all of the papers presented by the speakers are published in the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium Proceedings, this report will be confined to the published abstracts and a few comments. As the Keynote speaker, Marge Christensen gave a humorous but serious speech titled: \"Scientists, UFOs, and Anti- Scientific Thinking.\" During the years that the UFO controversy has been raging, scientists and scientific publications have been guilty of some of the most anti-scientific statements and anti-scientific thinking on the subject ever made. Simultaneously, UFO researchers have been appealing to the scientific community — to very little avail — for objective and scientific study of the UFO phenomenon. Throughout all of this, UFO reports have persisted on a global scale and UFOs have been sighted by many highly credible persons. Examples are cited of this anti-scientific thinking on (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Michael D. Swords, Ph.D. SYMPOSIUM, Continued the part of scientists, and possible reasons are examined as to why scientists react this way to the UFO subject. A call is made for scientists to abandon such faulty thinking and to begin to exhibit a genuine scientific curiosity about the UFO subject and to take an objective, disapassionate look at the UFO evidence accumulated to date. CASE FOR E.T. The theme for the 1985 UFO symposium was dynamically addressed by Michael D. Swords, Ph.D. in his stunning, provocative, and enlightening paper. The phenomena of UFOlogy and their most prominently argued cause (the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence or ETI observing Earth) have been the. focus of much emotionalism in some members of the scientific community. This is philosophically distressing and sociologically intriguing given that the available data from many fields of science point toward the probability of many intelligent life forms in our galaxy. Frontiers of several scientific disciplines are surveyed in the pursuit of the leading edge of current thought on the hypotheses of life forms elsewhere. Finally, some reflections are included on the likelihood of ETI, and why the field of UFOlogy is routinely attacked by some individuals, allegedly in the cause of Science. It has been wisely suggested that Dr. Swords paper should get greater exposure to the scientific community through publication in scientific and associated journals due to the impact it had upon the audience. ABDUCTIONS David M. Jacobs, Ph.D. delivered a well organized and logical speech with a very intriguing title. Abduction cases constitute one of the greatest challenges to UFO researchers since the phenomenon began. They are extremely important if they are directly related to UFOs and they are almost as important if they are not. The question of why abductions have this transcendent meaning regardless of their origin is discussed. In the past decade, a steadily increasing flow of abduction reports has come to the attention of UFO researchers. These reports could be, in my estimation, the most significant aspect of the UFO phenomenon since the controversy began in 1947. Like the first reports of occupants, they have met with incredulity and resistance from UFO researchers anxious to disassociate themselves from bogus claims. But also like the occupant claims, their quantity, content, patterns, and the credibility of the victims are slowly forcing UFO researchers to accept them as an important element in the UFO debate. AWARDS Two plaques were awarded by MUFON recognizing individuals for their contributions to the field of Ufology. Budd Hopkins received the • annual \"198586 MUFON award for outstanding work in the UFO field.\" Mr. Hopkins was also presented with a $250 check by Bruce Maccabee from the Fund for UFO Research in memory of Isabel Davis. In the absence of Mrs. Mimi Hynek, John Timmerman accepted the plaque give to Dr. J. Allen Hynek posthumously. The inscription on the plaque read: \"Given in recognition for your lifelong dedication and contributions to UFO research and public education.\" -- Mutual UFO Network 1986.

Allen Hynek SYMPOSIUM, Continued The symposium audience was treated to a preview of the forthcoming NASA Space Station by Alan C. Holt, M.S., a physicist assigned to this ambitious project. He compared theoretical UFO propulsions systems with power sources and constructipn techniques being developed for future space stations in his paper. Several interestellar propulsion concepts have been proposed which could provide a roundtrip time of 50 years as referenced to an onboard spacecraft clock. These very large spacecraft using various forms of nuclear power will have to be assembled in Earth orbit, probably on a construction platform near a space station. However, to provide sufficient motivation for a civilization to conduct interstellar exploration (other than through a slow migration process) will require the development and testing of propulsion techniques which can effectively exceed the speed of light. Theoretical physics and emerging technologies are providing insight into approaches which may lead to the development of faster than light transportation systems. UFO research has already provided motivation, new perspectives, and in some cases data in support of the development of these advanced interstellar propulsion systems. The Space Station and its large space structure construction and transportation capabilities may be the forerunner of Earth's first interstellar spaceport. The United States and other nations are developing plans to expand man's exploration of the Solar System. New commercial enterprises are being contemplated involving experiments and industrial facilities in Earth orbit, on the Moon, and on other planetary bodies. These activities will further increase the demand for advanced, cost-effective transportation systems. The transportation needs created by the initial steps of this movement of mankind into space are stimulating the consideration of advanced space shuttles and interplanetary spacecraft. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION Harley D. Rutledge, Ph.D. is one of a small body of scientists that has actually conducted UFO field investigations with instrumentation. He shared the results of hjs work in this paper. Some scientists who have never seen a UFO, or even carried out field research with instrumentation, offer examples of natural and manmade phenomena as explanations. In rebuttal, Project Identification sightings are reviewed and updated as the author claims 160 personal sightings. Incredible accounts by military pilots and other field researchers are reviewed. All this leads to possible paranormal aspects of the UFO phenomena. At the symposium, a bizarre sighting by another member of the speaker's panel will be confirmed. The'author concludes that the skeptics and cynics have built a case against the existence of UFOs that has become cumbersome and untenable. The origin of the true UFO phenomena, as researched in Project Identification, is not natural or manmade nor misperceptions by Project observers. UFO PHOTOGRAPH Richard F. Haines, Ph.D. has used one of the tools originally invented and developed for the reception of electronic photograph surveillance of our planets by space probes such as Voyager and Pioneer. Computer photo enhancement has been used for over ten years as a technique and tool to analyze alleged UFO photographs. Various investigative activities and analyses surrounding a photograph of a purported unidentified flying object (UFO) taken on October 8, 1981 at about 11:00 a.m. local time on Vancouver Island, British Columbia are reviewed. The evidence consisted of a single frame of 35mm color film which showed a sharply focused disc-like object against a clear blue sky with a wooded mountain peak nearby. Analyses of the original negative included microdensitometry, computer enhancements, and other measure- ments intent upon showing a support thread, atmospheric disturbance) or other evidence of a hoax. These analyses suggest that the disc was a three-dimensional object at a distance of at least 20 feet from the camera whose surface albedo was diffuse and of lower luminance than sunlit cloud. Extensive interviews with the photographer (who never saw the aerial object) and her husband and daughter, and a site survey, tended to support the entire narrative accunt. The nature of the disc object remains unidentified. (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SYMPOSIUM, Continued John F. Schuessler, M.S. has continued to follow both the medical and legal aspects of the Cash-Landrum UFO Case and has shared the results of his investigations with everyone in his symposium papers starting in 1982; Judge Ross Sterling, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division has not rendered a decision to have the case dismissed that was submitted to him on September 3, 1985 by Frank A. Conforti, Assistant United States Attorney, Attorney for the Defendant (United States Government)., As of April 25,1986, Bill Shead and Rhonda S. Ross, Co-counsels in Civil Action No. H-84-3488 have legally responded, thus keeping the case very much alive on behalf of the plantiffs, Betty Cash, Vicki Landrum and Colby Landrum. Throughout the investigation of the Dec. 29,1980, Cash-Landrum UFO case the primary witnesses have insisted that a large number of military helicopters. surrounded and followed the UFO. In addition, the witnesses have repeatedly stated their belief that the UFO was owned and operated by the military. For this reason, they sought help by going to official Government agencies; including the U.S. Congress, military bases, military agencies, and finally a U.S. District Court. The issue of Government responsibility for the injuries to the primary witnesses is chronicled and examined. Prior to the Saturday evening program, Bruce Maccabee conducted a workshop for interested people on the very significant 1978 New Zealand motion picture footage in which he very effectively squelched the claims by Philip Klass that the object is nothing more than a squid boat. On Sunday morning a very popular event, initiated in St. Louis in 1985, was continued — Breakfast with the Speakers. This was an opportunity for each of the attendees to personally meet and visit with a speaker of their choice. Following breakfast another decision faced each participant.

Bletchman SYMPOSIUM, Continued the MUFON Staff Member on abductions, Budd Hopkins led a discussion on \"missing time\" cases and the technique of regressive hypnosis as a tool. SCIENCE STILL IN DEFAULT Many of the speakers in their talks invited and encouraged scientists to become greater involved in the study of the UFO phenomenon. Some even chided them for their unscientific behavior. Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D. proceeded to disclose how a few of the debunkers have provided their own explanations, but not based on scientific facts. For nearly 40 years, the science establishment has ignored the UFO problem, relegating it to the domain of believers and mental incompetents (a.k.a. \"kooks and nuts\"). Scientists have participated in a \"self-cover-up\" by refusing to look at the credible and well reported data. Furthermore, some of those few scientists who have studied UFO data have published explanations which are unconvincing or just plain wrong and have \"gotten away with it\" because most of the rest of the community has not cared enough to analyze these explanations. The general rejection of the scientific validity of UFO sightings has made it difficult to publish analyses of good sightings. Examples are presented by the scientific self-cover-up involving erroneous explanations, refusal to look at the data, and rejection of papers for publication. How long will this situation last? Forty years is long enough! \"No scientific investigation of the UFO problem has been carried out during the entire twenty-two year period between the first extensive wave of sightings of unidentified flying objects in the summer of 1947 and the convening of this symposium.\" The above statement was made by the late Dr. James E. McDonald at the UFO symposium held by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 1969. Even now, 17 year later, it is still true. Why? UFO ADS Robert H. Bletchman, J.D., State Director for Connecticut, has embarked upon a very ambitious advertising program to bring the issue of the UFO enigma to the public and specifically the U.S. government, so as to disclose what the U.S. intelligence community actually knows about UFOs. This program has the complete support of the sponsoring agency — the Mutual UFO Network. The question is addressed of how to galvanize public opinion into a political force that would result in full disclosure of UFO evidence.

This would be done by activating American entrepreneurship to put the case before the public effectively. BENTWATERS Raymond W. Boeche, State Director for Nebraska and alternate speaker for this year's symposium, has continued to interview eye-witnesses to the Rendlesham Forest Case after they returned to the U.S.A.; both in and out of the U.S. Air Force. His revelations were so important that it was imperative research by Scott Colburn and himself be published in the proceedings. The premier UFO case of the last several years undoubtedly has been the event referred to as the Bentwaters Incident or the Rendelsham Forest Case. Its tale of a landed UFO and contact with the occupants by high- ranking officers of the U.S. Air Force has captured the interest of the UFOlogical community and the public at large. At this point, some 17 eyewitnesses have been found, official documentation has been obtained, and more is being sought at the present time. Because of conflicting Government responses, and a very evasive approach to this case by a United States Senator, it would appear that the Government is attempting to cover up the full story of what occurred on that night in December of 1980. We want to thank Denise Mount for designing the cover for the program and the posters for the Michigan symposium and Donald Schmitt for the cover design and artists rendition of the 1986 proceedings. The CUFOS UFO Photo Exhibit, scheduled for the East Lansing symposium, was picked up one week late by Consolidated Freightway in Rochester, New York. It arrived in East Lansing after 5 p.m. on Friday, too late 8 to be unloaded from the truck for a local delivery to M.S.U. The exhibit remained inaccessible in the loaded truck until Monday morning despite the combined efforts of John P. Timmerman, the MUFON host committee, the Kellogg Center staff and the person in charge of the M.S.U. central receiving facility on campus. Mr. Timmerman was obviously very disappointed and is taking this opportunity to apologize to the attendees. The CUFOS UFO Photo Exhibit was to be one of the featured attractions. HOST COMMITTEE The sucess of this year's annual symposium must be attributed to Dan Wright, symposium chairman, and the host committee — Michigan MUFON for their fantastic work. George and Shirley Coyne headed reservations and registrations and were ably assisted by Denise Mount and Dorothy Lewis. The shuttle service from the airport, railroad station and bus station was coordinated by Paul L. Bailor with the fine help of Wayne Erickson and Duane W. Dalgleish. Violet P. Kolberg, Josephine Zajkoski and Joan M. Carpenter handled the sales of the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium Proceedings, the attractive MUFON jacket patches and the blue vinyl portfolios with the corporate name heat-stamped in gold, including the lined notepad for Field Investigators. Your Director was especially appreciative of these ladies since they took complete responsibility for the sales of the proceedings. Wayne Erickson produced individual audio cassette tape recordings of each speaker that are all also available for sale. Virignia M. Tilly operated the closed circuit TV equipment in the exhibit room where UFO filmed documentaries were displayed. Martin Mount and Ed Hude quietly and efficiently handled security for the symposium. Photography was performed by Dennis Hafer, who was taking color photos for the host committee scrapbook, and Bill Diesenroth, the MUFON UFO Journal official photographer, who produced the black and white photos illustrating this article. George and Shirely Coyne are taking a supply of the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium Proceedings to Beverly, Mass, to be sold at the Massachusetts MUFON UFO Forum on August 9 and 10. They will also have a supply of the new MUFON blue vinyl portfolios and the MUFON patches. The attractive rectangular patches have the inscription \"Mutual U.F.O. Network\" in white embroidery on a navy blue background. The portfolios and patches each sell for $4.00. Shirley and George Coyne, Reservations"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MINNESOTA CE-III By Bill McNeff BUI McNeff is MUFON's state director for Minnesota. On April 27, 1985,1 was invited by my friend, Don .Flickinger, a field investigator for CUFOS, to accompany him to interview a farm wife near Park Rapids, Minn., who had written Dr. Hynek about a close encounter of the third kind she said she had had. I will call her Mrs. Z.* She and her husband own a small farm out in the country where they raise hogs, but I think he also has a job in town. Mrs. Z. is a mild-mannered and calm woman. She was about 33 years old at the time of the sighting, which occurred on or about October 27,1984. (She felt that date was accurate plus or minus a week.) We asked her to show us where the sighting had occurred and to go through all the details with us. She showed us where she had been standing out by the hog lot fence after doing the chores with her stepson, B.* It was dark enough that the security or yard light had gone on. The have an interest in astronomy and were looking south at the stars, when they saw two diamond-shaped objects approach from the east and pass slowly along the horizon, appearing to be over some trees which are about a half mile away. A road goes along beside these trees, with a power line along the road. The UFOs were emitting a bluish- white light, but the light was somewhat erratic, reminding them of electric sparks or the glittering of a gem-stone. As the objects reached a point somewhat west of true south, B., who was about 17, unaccountably turned and began to walk back toward the house, which was about 80 feet away. Shortly before he reached the house, Mrs. Z told B., \"I think I see something moving out in the hog lot.\" B. ignored this and went on into the house. *Confidentialy Requested Whatever was out in the hog lot came closer and she saw that it was a figure about four feet tall, roughly human in general shape, with a large head and large eyes. It approached closer until it was about 20 to 25 feet away from her across the fence. It had a short nose and a short neck. She assumed it had closely fitting clothing, but could recall no details, and couldn't be sure it was wearing clothes. It had slender limbs and its hands reached to its knees. On its face was what appeared to be a smile — a feature almost unique in the annals of UFO creatures. Although the creature was standing about 80 feet from the yard light (which I would guess was 500 or 1000 watts as most farmstead lights are), she could not tell us the creature's color. (We did not see the light while it was on, but Mr. Z. described it as one of those orange-rose lights, which I believe is a mercury vapor light. These lights have a tendency to \"wash out\" colors, making subtle ones hard to detect.) A best guess at the creature's color from her description would be grey. DISAPPEARS Mrs. Z. stared at the creature for an estimated five minutes. During this time she did not try to call her family, or speak to the creature, for fear of frightening it. It seemingly made no attempt to communicate with her in any way. She was not frightened, she said. Finally, the creature turned around and walked away, disappearing into the darkness apparently before it reached the five-wire fence about 80 feet away. She did not see the creature climb the fence. She waited by the fence a couple of minutes more to see if the creature would perhaps come back. When it did not, she went into the house to tell her family what she had seen. She did not remember seeing what the UFOs did after she first saw the creature. She felt that the total time she stood looking at the creature, and he at her, was about 10 minutes. Their German Shepherd and their other dog were not in evidence during the sighting. There were three hogs on the place at the time. None of the animals gave any reaction. B. said it was maybe 4 or 5 minutes after he went into the house that Mrs. Z. came in. He described her as being \"somewhat excited.\" She told us that she had no dreams or bad effects following the experience. Sometime after her experience, perhaps a week or two, she had some kind of unusual feelings in her abdomen. She visited her doctor, and in the course of the examination, he applied a stethoscope to her stomach and commented, \"It sounds like Niagara Falls in there.\" He did not express any alarm about this or offer any diagnosis. The funny feeling later disappeared. AFTERMATH After she had shown us the scene of the encounter outside, she invited us into the house. We sat down at the dining room table and continued to ask questions and take notes; I had my tape recorder running all this time. Because the question of the UFO's size was not yet resolved, Don asked Mrs. Z: and stepson B. to go back outside and help him figure this out. Mr. Z. and I talked about hbgraising and UFOs, and Mr. Z. volunteered with a smile that they had told Mrs. Z. that she had mistaken their boar pig for an alien creature. This comment of his, in my opinion, adds to the family's credibility; it indicates that the whole family did not conspire together to make up this story. THe witness, it should be noted, did not have a technical mindset, and (continued on page 19)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"NEWS 'N' VIEWS I have two additions to my article (No. 217, May. 1986) about recent possible., UFO sightings near Columbus, Ohio. The first observation occurred around the middle of July in 1985, approximately 1/3 mile northwest of the alfalfa barn. I found out about it from my sister, who said that she. had heard J.M., a nine year old boy, talking about it. I called him and his parents and later interviewed him on tape.: J.M-, camping with his family in a woods on their family farm, got up to go to an outbuilding after the others, had gone to sleeep. As he approached the small building, he glanced at what he thought was a helicopter in the distance.. As the,object approached from the southeast, he realized it was spherical. It descended and stopped just over some trees (he estimated approirnately 50-100 feet from him)..He believed the sphere to have been around 20-30 feet in diameter. Its outer portion was a rough white surface with scattered black areas. From spots along the outside flashed rays of white, green, red, and blue light, in such a rrianner that the ray from each spot would be white, followed by green, red, and then blue with \"about a minute in .between each one.\" LIGHT RAYS Some rays were directed downward, but he said they \"didn't touch the ground.\" The ray that came closest to him was green and around 10- 20 feet away. He joked that the rays reminded him of the transporter beam in the Star Trek TV series and he feared he might be transported into the UFO if a ray illuminated him. He was scared and didn't move, scream, or run. After he had watched the object for a while, two orange pipes moved out from one side between two of the spots where the rays were flashing. He didn't know what the pipes were, but 10 commented that perhaps they had something to do with the object \"getting its direction.\" He added that he didn't know how it did it, but at that time the sphere was spinning and the orange things weren't spinning. I asked him if they looked metallic and he said, \"It didn't look like metal or iron.\" Then the UFO sort of swirled in a circle and flew to the southeast. When asked about noise he said, \"I couldn't hear any because of ail the circkets chirping.\" AFRAID Although J.M. wasn't sure, he estimated the sighting to have lasted for 5-10 minutes. As soon as the object left he ran to his sleeping bag and hid. He was scared to awaken his parents and did not tell them about the sighting, because he \"didn't want them to think I'm crazy.\" He told several people afterwards, who confirmed that he had mentioned the sighting that summer and continues to describe the object in the same way. He is intelligent, doing well in school, and everyone that I asked said he is reliable. His story seemed consistent. Several times as I interviewed him I would repeat something to mislead him and he always corrected me. There is no record of advertising airplanes in this area. He is used to seeing helicopters and to being out-of- doors on this farm. Although this is not a good sighting because of having only one witness, perhaps it should still be reported, because J.M. has a good reputation. PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying photograph of the area of the possible sighting shows a drawing of the object, the beam nearest the witness, the two orange pipes (on the .right), the object's trajectory when approaching and leaving (arrows), and the location of the witness (triangle) as drawn from his sketch on a photograph. -Irena Scott"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"NEW BOOKS BY MEMBERS \"Melbourne Episode - Case Study of a Missing Pilot\" by Richard F.

FULTON Mr. Harold Henry Fulton, National Director for New Zealand since 1973, passed away at his home in Palmerston North on Sunday morning, June 15, 1986 due to a heart attack at the a'ge of 65. Mr. Fulton was.one pf the pioneers in ufplogy, known throughout the world for his investigative activities starting in 1947. He served for 24 years in the Technical Division of the Royal New Zealand Air Force. He founded Civilian Saucer Investigation (New Zealand), a 500 member objective investigation organization, in 1952. Harold was introduced to the Mutual UFO Network by Mrs. Idabel E. Epperson, former State Director for Southern California. He is survived by his widow, Evelyn, and children. His funeral was held on June 17, 1986. Everyone at MUFON wishes to express our condolences to Mrs. Fulton and his family. Mr. Murray Bptt, Section Director for the North Island, called' by telephone from Auckland, New Zealand on June 16th to deliver the sad news. BRITONS BELIEVE A recent public opinion survey reveals an astonishing attitude among Britons about' Unidentified Flying Objects. The majority of the British people believe an invasion of Earth from outer space is imminent. They believe it will happen within five years. The House of Lords pressured the British Ministry of Defense to admit it has 1 given' serious attention to UFOs by releasing data to the British UFO Research Association. Maybe the British people have good reason .to believe something serious is going on. UFO sightings have been on the increase over: that island nation. During :the fall of, 1985, reports came in from even the most remote areas. Young and old alike saw strange things in the sky. The Carlton area'was the scene of some exciting events. A 14 year old boy ran home crying hysterically and was temporarily ; blinded '-after seeing a brightly lit object. He was treated by a doctor. A similar report was given by an eight year old boy. Several witnesses reported a UFO hit or nearly hit a radar station on the moor on August 4,1985. The incident caused several days of excitement around the radar station: \"' Two tax drivers watched a UFO over Deeside in late January, 1986. One of the drivers, a Mr. Leonard Parker, said he was driving back to the office when he spotted a brightly lit object about 200 feet above him. He stopped and got out of the taxi and watched as it glided towards him. He said it was cone-shaped, had one blue spotlight and lots of yellow lights on the underside. The UFO was totally silent. When he returned to the office he found Paul Jones, another driver, already describing his similar encounter. During the second week of February 1986, another taxi driver and his young woman passenger spotted three bright orange lights in the sky over the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough. The driver, Gerry Hurn, turned, his cab around, and chased the lights until they suddenly disappeared. Danielle Mansbridge, the passenger said \"there was ho noise at all.\" The lights amazed her. She said \"they were blazing orange, very big and bright.\" A police spokeswoman'described how a number of citizens had become involved with UFOs during the past several months. He told how a Wymondham girl had a close encounter of the scary kind when she was followed home by a bright light. Describing his feelings the policeman said he had just taken a new report and the man making the report \"was not the sort to make things up.\" . What are the Britons seeing? No one seems to be able to provide a satisfactory answer. It is no wonder they are expecting an invasion from space any day now..... —Source uncrcditcd (Newspaper Clipping) Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J.

Allen Hynek 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MORE ON BETTY HILL By Wayne Laporte Wayne Laporte is MUFON's State Section Director for North Carolina. Although I share some of Mr. Webb's views (that Betty Hill is misidentifying many IFOs as UFOs — MUFON Journal, #215, March, 1986, page 16), I also share Mr. Long's view (that there are genuine UFOs in the Kingston, N.H. area - MUFON Journal, #218, June, 1986, page 14). To support Long's contention, I relate the following information. Prior to my 1978 visit with Betty, I interviewed George Fawcett and his wife Shirley shortly after they returned from their New England trip during which they accompanied Betty to her \"landing site:\" Both observed what I believe were anomalous events. While they were in the field late at night, several star-like objects blinked on. The lights were in all quadrants of the sky and hovered low over the treetops. Strangely,.these lights would dim out as autos neared. and then return to their regular intensity after the cars passed. After about an hour the lights vanished for good. Later, as the trio were leaving, a white, glowing spheroid, the apparent size of a pea, silently approached them, made a 90- degree upward turn, .and streaked skyward out of sight. The next day George and Shirley returned to the .site and found three circular rings about 20 feet in diameter in the field. No local investigation or soil analysis was made due to lack of time. So, the rings may or may not be anything anomalous. - My personal visit to the site was only met with probable success: On July -10th and 12th, 1978, Mrs. Vikki Mann, a personal friend, and myself met with Joan Jeffers and Paul Johnson, both MUFON State Section Directors and members of the Pennsylvania Center for UFO Research and Mrs. Hill. No true UFOs were seen on either skywatch. Betty, in 12 her excitement, did misidentify some aircraft as UFOs. However, on the 10th we all sighted a strange searchlight beam. . BEAM OF LIGHT . Most of the evening was spent in our cars due to passing thunderstorms. The searchlight .beam appeared a few times during the storm and once afterwards. A green glow would develop and then be replaced by a column of light which projected upward and was inclined about 30 degrees off the vertical. The beam would swing to the vertical in about 5 to 6 seconds and then vanish. This same routine was observed on all random appearances of the light. At first we thought it was a searchlight. The topo map indicated there were no towns in the direction of the light—only swampland. Ms. Jeffers jokingly remarked, \"Maybe, it's swamp gas.\" Later, Ms. Jeffers suggested that the light was someone signaling for a drug drop. Although this is a possibility, my feeling is that the light was too intense and too greenish for a flashlight. Besides, only a very foolish or desperate pilot would make a drug drop during a thunderstorm. On July 12th, while a few miles south of the site and while climbing a hill in a very rural area, Mrs. Mann and myself observed a cluster of red lights hovering over a field. Since we were running late for our meeting with Betty, we elected to go on rather than investigate. So, all I can say is that this may have been a UFO. Could the unusual lights observed at the site all have been a form of natural phenomenon? Possibly. Survivors of earthquakes have reported seeing flashes of light, fireballs, streamers of light, columns of light, ruddy glows in the sky, or searchlight beams. FAULT ZONES A study of a geological map and report on the Kingston area indicated some very interesting facts. Her site is only 10 miles north of a major fault zone known as the Clinton-Newburg Fault, and there is a known fault outcropping two miles south of her landing site. The area is mainly quartz. In fact, the Exeter Diorite — a two-mile-wide bed of quartz — extends from Kingston to Exeter, New Hampshire (a place. of many repeat UFO sightings.) To me, there are indications that Mrs. Hill has located what some ufologists call a \"window\" — a place where UFOs repeatedly manifest themselves. To ancient people these areas were considered sacred — areas of high natural energy. Today, we know that many of these windows are at quartz concentrations on or near fault lines. • . Now, whether UFOs observed at these sites are a natural phenomenon (a la M. Persinger), dimensional entities utilizing energy fields to materialize (a la J. Keel), or projections resulting from an interplay of seismic energy fields and intense psychic energy of observers (a la T. Bearden) remains to be proven. However, I do feel that there are some strange things going bump in the night around Kingston, N.H. SUPPORT UFO RESEARCH MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN, TX 78155"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"BEIMTWATERS UPDATE By Mildred Biesele In the May '85 Journal, Walt Andrus wrote in the Director's Message that State Director for Nebraska Ray Boeche had been in touch with his senator, the Honorable J. James Exon, hoping to interest him in the Bentwaters case. As Senator Exon is a member of the Armed Services Committee, Boeche hoped that a more thorough investigation of the incident by the Committee might follow if Senator Exon became-involved. In fact, Andrus said, Boeche had spoken on the phone with Colonel Charles I. Halt, Deputy Base Commander at Bentwaters at the time of the incident in December, 1980, and Halt had said that the would hand over to Senator Exon the audio tapes, photographs, plaster casts, and other material evidence of his investigation into the UFO landing in Rendlesham Forest, if he were asked to do so by the Senator. The MUFON Director authorized State Directors to write their senators and solicit their help in bringing this case to the public. In June '85,1 wrote to Senator Jake Garn.of Utah and quoted from Halt's letter a brief description of the event. I told him of Halt's promise to turn over pertinent information to Senator Exon upon request, and I asked Senator Garn to use his influence to see that the evidence was given to the Senator from Nebraska. About six months later, I had a reply from Senator Garn's office, enclosing a letter that he had received from the Air Force in response to his query. (Enclosed) MISSES POINt In December I wrote Senator Garn again and thanked him for the letter. But, I said, some questions still remained in my mind. I enclosed a copy of Col. Halt's entire letter describing the incident, and I pointed out that at least a preliminary investigation had obviously been done by the Air Force. I said that Col. Halt, now in Korea, had stated that he had in his possession evidence of the landing, which he was willing to give to Senator Exon, and \"the purpose of my letter was to urge you to speak to the Senator. Your letter was not responsive to this point.\" , • -I continued, \"It is not true, as.the letter to you from Lt. Col. Weaver states, that. the Air Force has not investigated UFO reports since 1969 when'Project Blue Book was closed.\" I pointed out that documents .released under the Freedom of Information Act showed that even before 1969, only those sightings that were not considered to be a threat to national security were referred to Blue Book, and after Blue Book was terminated sightings that were considered a threat to national security, according to Gen. C.H. Bolender, \"would continue to be handled through the standard Air Force procedure designed for that purpose.\" I noted that a more recent memo said that UFO sightings over USAF bases are investigated, and I pointed out that there had been frequent overflights and landings logged at SAC and NORAD bases 1 . STUDY CONTINUES As further evidence that investigation of UFOs continued after 1969, I cited the NORAD form for \"Unidentified Object Reports,\" dated October 1977, which is reproduced in the appendix of the book Clear Intent by Fawcett and Greenwood. In conclusion, I told Senator Garn that I was asking Dr. Bruce Maccabee to send him copies of the. documents I had referred to and other relevant documents released by the government because \"I think it is important for you to have this information which apparently has hot been made available to you through the Office of Legislative Liaison. I think you have the right to know because you have the responsibility to act.\" And then I waited for a response:!- And waited. Finally in the middle of April I had a telephone call from Senator Garn's office. A very pleasant young woman told me that Senator Garn apologized for the delay in replying to my last letter and he agreed that his letter to me had left some questions unanswered. SENATORS TALK Senator Garn, she said; had indeed talked to Senator Exon about the Bentwaters case. A \"personal consultation\" had taken place between Col. Halt and Sen. Exon in which the officer said that he felt that the Air Force had handled the incident well, that there had been no attempt at a cover-up, and there seemed to be no need for an Armed Services Committee investigation. She did not say whether the evidence that Col. Halt claimed to have in his possession was turned over to the Senator or to anyone else, but I gathered that there was a more complete investigative report given to the Senator. I asked whether this would be released to the public, and she said no, it was private and confidential, just between 'the two of them, and was protected from disclosure by the privacy act.- I . then asked if any natural explanation had been suggested for what happened at Bentwaters, and she said no: \"these things happen, and sometimes there is no explanation.\" She told me one other interesting thing, that since his space flight the Senator has been more than ever convinced that we are not alone in the universe. This is borne out by an interview marking the first anniversary of his flight aboard the shuttle Discovery in April, 1985.

The 23rd Annual National UFO Conference was held on the weekend of May 16-18, 1986 at the Executive Park Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona with Hal Stair, general chairman and James W. Mpseley, permanent chairman.' This annual event has varied in size from over a thousand in 1967 in downtown New York City, hosted by Jim Moseley, to 30 people in Fremont, Calif., in 1985, hosted by Kal K. Korff. Dr. Edward U. Condon attended the 1967 conference to prove to his own satisfaction that only \"kooks\" were involved with Ufplogy. Indeed, he did find several such people who seem to gravitate to such public events to \"peddle their wares.\" And yes, a few slipped into the 1986 conference in Phoenix, but were handled quite diplomatically by the general chairman, Hal Starr. Having never attended any of the prior. 22 National UFO Conferences (6 more than MUFON), this one appealed to me for several reasons: (1) Stanton T. Friedman and William L. Moore were two of the featured speakers, (2) I wanted to support Hal Starr, MUFON's State Section Director for Maricopa County who was the host chairman, (3) ah opportunity to personally,meet Erik Beckjord, Robert Sheaffer, Travis Walton, Mike Rogers, and Timothy Good, (4) the pleasure of renewing old friendships with Brad Steiger, Jim. Moseley and Daniel Fry and (5) the privilege of meeting many of our members from Arizona, Nevada, Idaho and California. (Even Tom Adams and Gary Massey from Texas.) The program organized by Mr. Starr was similar to the MUFON Interna- tional UFO.Symposium format. WALTON No attempt will be made to report . Hal Starr, NUFOC Moderator on each speaker's presentation, but I'll provide an overview of the conference from an interested visitor's viewpoint. A \"get acquainted party\" in the NUFOC Hospitality Suite on Friday evening was a delightful occasion to meet new people and greet old friends. Travis Walton and Michael Rogers arrived during the height of the festivities, stayed briefly, and drove back to Snowflake, Arizona. Basically a shy person, Travis when questioned, stated that he wouldn't feel comfortable or at ease it he was bombarded with questions, therefore elected to leave. This was a disappointment for many of us, since we had hoped to get better acquainted with both Travis and Mike. Jim Moseley cordially opened the meeting Saturday morning with greetings, remarks, announcements, then promptly introduced Hal Starr, the master of ceremonies. Erik Beckjord, of Bigfoot fame and now living in Malibu, Calif., showed the \"1978 New Zealand Motion Picture Film\" with commentary analysis provided to him by BruceS. Maccabee, Ph.D., the prime investigator. David Crockett, a MUFON member now living in Honolulu, Hawaii, was the photographer of this very significant visual - radar - filmed sequence: (It was first shown at the MUFON 1979 UFO. Symposium in Burlingame, Calif, by Bruce Maccabee and David Crockett.) Mr. Beckjord effectively refuted the \"squid boat\" explanation by Philip Klass and the. \"fleet of squid boats\" proposed by Robert Sheaffer. Daniel W. Fry, author of The White Sands Incident, published in i%6, and one of the few pioneer \"contactees\" still living, gave an overview of his experience in light of today's experiences and space travel knowledge. Very little time was devoted ' to his personal experience on July 4, 1950 at White Sand Proving Grounds, outside of Las Cruces, New Mexico, where he claimed that hie went aboard a UFO, flew to New York City and back in 30 minutes and conversed with an absent entity. He referred interested people to his revised book To Men of Earth (including the White Sands Incident), Merlin Publishing (1973), that was available to purchase at the conference. I obtained an autographed copy of his original book after hearing him lecture in St. Louis, Missouri in 1967. SKEPTIC Robert Sheaffer, a member of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) UFO Committee with Philip Klass and James Oberg, titled his presentation \"Famous UFO Cases I Don't Believe In.\" His slide/illustrated lecture would have been very appropriate if delivered to his local Bay Area Skeptics (CSICOP), because they would have laughed with him as he attempted to superficially explain several cases. (He even showed a faked photograph of a UFO that he made himself that appears on the cover jacket of his book.) Utilizing one newspaper clipping of (continued next page) 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"NATIONAL, Continued the 1948 era containing an incorrect date (probably obtained from Phil Klass), he rejected the Roswell, New Mexico case — as an example. The case was explained and dismissed, he admitted when questioned, without him having interviewed any of the witnesses or participants in person or by telephone. He explained the Aztec, New Mexico crashed saucer, made famous by Frank Sully's book Behind the Flying Saucers, by making reference to Silas M. Newton and \"Dr. Gee\" as reported by J.P. Cahn. William L. Moore's paper in the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings titled \"Crashed Saucers: Evidence in Search of Proof clearly delineates the result of his exhuustive investigation that proves the case to be a hoax. (Did Bill Moore's investigation and paper provide the solution for Robert Sheaffer?) Robert Sheaffer must be commended for having the intestinal fortitude to accept Hal Starr's invitation to speak. It was not a hostile audience, but one composed of researchers who were more knowledgeable about UFOs than Mr. Sheaffer. His superficial explanations were in vain. Brad Steiger, now a resident of Phoenix, is the author of over 100 book titles ranging from biographies (Judy Garland,'Greta Garbo, Valentino) to true crime (The Mass Murderer) ; from the strange (Mysteries of Time and Space) to medical breakthroughs (Stella: One Woman's Victory over Cancer) totaling over 15 million copies internationally. Brad gave a slide/illustrated lecture depicting approximately 21 hypotheses for the possible origin of UFOs and their entities as \"food for thought\" and speculation. \"UFOs....The Most Highly Classified Subject,\" a startling revelation of a higher than top secret project was the title of the speech delivered by William L. Moore. After sharing some pertinent facts with the aurdience, Bill proceeded as if in a court-of-law, to systematically dissect and destroy the superficial evidence proposed by Robert Sheaffer by providing investigated and researched facts. Mr. Sheaffer's jovial attitude ceased to be so prevalent after Bill Moore responsed so strongly in debate fashion. After the banquet Saturday morning, Walt Andrus briefed the audience on the status and future of ufology as it related to organizations, and the personal responsibility that each participant had to fill the void left by the passing of Dr. J. Allen Hynek. No one will be able to fill Dr. Hynek's shoes since he was unique, however, the quest to resolve the UFO phenomenon must continue unabated and with greater zeal. As permanent chairman of the National UFO Conference, Jim Moseley, in his own inimitable manner, greeted the conference attendees and provided a provocative answer to the solution for the UFO phenomenon — . \"It is within each of us.\" Stanton T. Friedman, whose thousands of public appearances has. exposed more people to the UFO subject than the efforts of almost any other person spoke next. His after dinner speech titled \"Fact, Fiction, and Flying Saucers\" was billed as a convincing address that would make a believer out of the staunchest skeptic. (I don't believe Robert Sheaffer was converted even though Stan delivered his college and university lecture in a dynamic and forceful style.) On Sunday morning, May 18th, an open forum for all delegates and all speakers, including other attending experts who did not present papers was conducted. An open and lively exchange of questions was forthcoming. One or two people in the audience from the \"fringe areas\" demanded and obtained an opportunity to communicate \"their message.\" The panel 'consisted of the following people: Timothy Good.from London, England, co-author with Lou Zinsstag of the book George Adamski - The Untold Story (January 1983) by Ceti Publications, Kent, England; Robert Sheaffer, author of The UFO Verdict: Examining the Evidence, (1981) Prometheus Books, Buffalo, New York; Timothy Green Beckley, publisher and editor of UFO Review magazine; Brad Steiger; Stanton T. Friedman, Fredericton, New Brunswick; William L. Moore, Burbank, Calif.; James W. Moseley, Key West, Florida; Erik Beckjord; Walter H. Andrus Jr., Seguin, Texas; and Harold \"Hal\" Starr, moderator. The Executive Park Hotel, 1100 North Central, Phoenix, Ariz, had beautiful rooms and facilities for the 23rd NUFOC. Your Director was treated like a visiting dignitary by the committee conducting the conference. Hal and Bea Starr are to be congratulated for their congenial and professional planning and implement- ation of the conference, including the hospitality suite. Jim and Anna Moseley played a major role in assisting Hal and Bea with arrangements and greeting the attendees. According to Ed Biebel, who has sponsored or attended a majority of the National UFO Conferences (their only activity), he ranked the twenty- third as one of the best, based upon the caliber of speakers, attendance, and facilities. The conference was dedicated to the memory of J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D., who passed away at his Scottsdale, Arizona home on April 27, 1986. BENTWATERS, Continued Lake Tribune, April 13, 1986, Thomas H.

UFOs in South America have always.been of interest, particularly in, the Andean regions of Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. Peru, a country of striking geographical, ..contrasts with barren deserts.V humid jungles and high mountains, has had a continual UFO experience 'that merits further investigation: As early as 1935 a youthful iridian named Pedro Eleodoro Paulet y Mostayo observed an! unusually- shaped UFO (called ovni in Spanish) with wing-like. projections, similar in appearance to the early U.S. satellites., Pedro's experience • occurred at Tiabaya, a small village of ,2200 inhabitants five miles southwest of Arequipa on the desert coast. Another UFO, different in shape, was sighted on July 5,1947 by most of the population of the same village and sightings have recurred at various times over the years. • After traveling extensively in Peru, I was able to confirm the continual presence of these haunting and inexplicable .ovnis.'At the Andean city of Huayahcayo the Indian inhabitants. spoke of brightly colored UFOs that frequently coasted over the mountains or flew in and out of the ice-capped peaks. A few reported lights that glowed reddish-orange-and were visible at great distances. One observer claimed that the bright light he was watching' divided itself into two lights and then disappeared.

The inhabitants of this region were willing to relate their experiences with balls of fire or ellipsoidal-shaped objects which floated over the desert or hovered for a few minutes and then flew away with incredible speed.

A proposal was floated at the MUFON Symposium at M.S.U. to use professional advertising in a campaign to lead to full U.S. Government disclosure of UFO evidence. The idea is that MUFON sponsor ads loaded with evocative UFO information, coupled with a solicitation for funds (to be earmarked for more media). The expectation is that contributions (tax deductible) :would exceed ad costs, creating a snowball effect of more ads, etc. The expected result would be that media (i.e., investigative jouralism from the establishment) would become committed to digging, into the story. I believe such digging by the media and rising public awareness will pressure government to fulfill its inherent duty in a democracy of Government by the (informed) consent of the governed. The advertising agency retained projects seed money of $27,500 to commence the campaign. That sum breaks down as $7,500 to develop a brochure; $5,000 to develop a mailing list; $15,000 to mail 100,000 brochures.

Dear Editor, In the article on the famous Mantell \"UFO-chase\" case of 1948 in the May issue, T. Scott Grain writes: \"The first flaw in this explanation (that Mantell was chasing a giant Skyhook balloon) is that no one to this day has ever produced records of a balloon launching that would put a skyhook in the right place at the right time the day Mantell died. Captain Ruppelt, an insider to the official UFO investigation, could find no records to put a Skyhook in the area during that day.\" As explained in my book UFOs Explained (p. 36), the Skyhook balloon, originally developed to carry scientific payloads to very high altitude, was modified to carry camera equipment and used to overfly the Soviet Union to try to penetrate the Iron Curtain. This I discovered while researching my book on \"spy satellites\" Secret Sentries in Space. The Navy provided the Skyhook balloons, a tiny handful of -scientists at Wright- Patterson AFB in Dayton developed the photo equipment and radio control that caused the camera to parachute down when, and if, it reached Japan. But the program was directed by the Central Intelligence Agency which maintains a heavy cloak of secrecy over its intelligence gathering means--even for decades. Thus, Ruppelt and others involved in the USAF's UFO investigations could only be told the meagerest of information about the Skyhook balloon secretly launched from Wilmington Air Force Base, some 30 miles southeast of Dayton. . ...... Philip J. Klass Washington, DC Dear Editor, One of the major arguments against the extraterrestrial hypothesis is the tremendous light year distances between neighboring star systems and the inherent speed of light restrictions of Special and General Relativity. I have no argument against the validity of Einstein's work in terms of mass acceleration, inertia build-up, and related time and space problems. We know that a ship traveling close to the speed of light will greatly slow its time in relation to stationary observers, but it would still take them many years to get here from our point of view. This .is due to Einstein's equivalence of gravitation and inertia. An object gains mass when accelerated and mass distorts time and space, i.e., gravity. However, it might be worth noting; that Relativity is currently at odds with Quantum (inner atomic) theory and the road to joining these two theories is still considered to be far off. Scientific theories gain little acceptance until proven. Einstein drew heavy opposition until experimental results, '.namely the distortion of starlight in proximity to the Sun's gravitational field verified relativity. But if a theory or hypothesis cannot be proven then the best thing is to remain logical and consistant with proven theory. .\"•\"''\" If you travel as fast as light your sense of time will stop. If you could go faster than light you would have to go back in time and this creates a whole pandora's box of problems for reality as we -know it. If time machines were possible, then all you would have to do is go back in time before the device was invented and change anything that we now know has occurred. The late Ivan T. Sanderson once attended a meeting at the Pentagon on the subject of UFOs. He off-handedly mentioned the subject of \"Teleport- ation\" and to his surprise a number of high ranking officers became alarmed and told him that they would not discuss it, and anyway \"we call it ITF (instant transference).\" In other words we are talking about a propulsion concept that does not utilize acceleration and inertia build-up. If you could project a ship through time and space through some (continued next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"LETTERS, Continued type of physical resonance within a solar system then would any space-time paradoxes result?

If a ship took a trip to another star about seven light years away, it would receive seven year-old signals from its home planet after the transfer. Upon return- ing home, however, it would find itself a few hours after it left. ITF differs from r light speed in that the time factors re- main the same for alLihdividual observ- ers.

Important work has been done on UFOs in nearby Argentina by the researcher Guillermo Roncoroni who has made a detailed study of 270 UFO cases! Roncoroni used a computer to acquire informaiton on such factors as the number of witnesses, the hour the UFO was observed, the population density of the region, witness activity at the time of the sighting and the monthly distribution of the sightings'. His findings indicate that UFOs operate away from population centers and usually show themselves before sunrise and about eight or nine o'clock in the evening. Some of his findings are confirmed by studies made in Europe and elsewhere. Do Peruvian UFOs show similar behavior patterns? The answer lies in doing intensive research in the varied regions of the country where data can be collected to compare with Roncoroni's work. The patterns of the desert UFO merit serious consider- ation because of their frequent appearances and varied shapes. Hopefully this project will be undertaken in the near future. 18 AUGUST 1986 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus, though still brightening at magnitude -4.4, is getting lower in the west, now setting near the end of twilight. It reaches its farthest point east of the sun (46°) -on the 27th and at that time appears as a little half moon in small telescopes.      • • Mars, still bright at magnitude -2.0 in Sagittarius, gleams low in the SSE at dusk. Even though the Earth is now pulling away from the ruddy planet, Mars continues this month to present a tiny disc worthy of study through backyard , telescopes. The planet resumes eastward motion on the 12th. Jupiter, retrograding in Aquarius, continues to brighten toward a September opposition. It now shines at magnitude -2.8 at midmonth. The giant planet rises in .the east about an hour after sunset (mid-August). .Saturn, in Scorpius, not far from Antares, lies in the SSW at dusk and sets about midnight in midmonth. It resumes direct or eastward motion 5 days before Mars does. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars sets in the WSW about 2 AM in mid-August: The moon is near the red 1 planet on the morning of the 16th. . . Jupiter is in the SW at dawn. On August 21 the moon appears near the bright planet.   • Meteor Shower: The year's finest meteor shower, the Perseids, peaks on the morning of the 12th. Since the first-quarter moon sets before midnight, this should be a good display; averaging about one meteor per minute as dawn approaches. The Perseids produce many bright fireballs radiating across the sky from a point in the north on the Perseus/Cassiopeia border. The shower appears in lesser numbers from late July to mid-August. Moon Phases: New moon - August 5 First quarter - August 12 Full moon - August 19 - Last quarter - August 27 € O"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued Mutual UFO Network and of the UFO subject in the distribution of UFO information to the public and media. (8) Plans are now being made to administer the Field Investigator Examination to Field Investigator Trainees by State and State Section Directors. Dan Wright reported that 273 Field Investigator Examinations had been mailed, 110 were completed and returned, and all but 3 people had passing grades of 80% in the first round of the new test. Short oral activity reports were made and more detailed written annual reports were submitted by each State Director present or their represent- ative. The following people made reports: Dan Wright, Michigan; Henry H. McKay, Ontario and Canada; Jerry Sievers, Indiana; Jim Melesciuc, Massachusetts; Michael Brein, Hawaii; Donald Ware, Florida; Don Curtis, Iowa; Paul Norman, Victoria, Australia; Mildred Biesele, Utah; Robert Bletchman, Connect- icut; Steve Toth, Ohio; Jean Fuller, Texas; Don Schmitt, Wisconsin; Joe Santangelo, Eastern Regional Director and Manager of MUFON Amateur Radio Net; Bruce Maccabee, Maryland; Leonard Sturm, Illinois; Richard Hall, Director of Publications; Joe Palermo, Missouri; and Gary Levine, New York by mail. The three most extensive activity written reports were submitted by Massachusetts, Missouri and Michigan. * * * \"UFOs: Beyond the Mainstream of Science\" is the theme for the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium Proceedings held June 27, 28, and 29 at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Mich. The caliber of speakers and papers published is the finest in our seventeen years of annual UFO symposiums. Copies may be obtained from MUFON for $10.00 each in U.S. funds plus $1.50 for postage and handling. Foreign orders must be paid in U.S. funds by International Postal Money Order, cash, or a check made payable to a U.S. Bank. Donald Schmitt, State Director for Wisconsin and a technical commercial artist, performed a fantastic piece of artwork on the cover design and rendition. Audio tape cassettes were made for each of the speakers at the 1986 UFO syposium and are available for $4.00 each from Wayne Erickson, 13468 Arnold St., Bedford, Mich. 48239. On each tape sold, one half of the amount will be given to Michigan MUFON to help defray symposium expenses. Even though most of the symposium was videotaped, it was done privately for future network programs and documentaries. Joe Palermo, Public Relations Director for Missouri, attended the Michigan Symposium and announced that video tapes of the individual lectures in both VMS and Beta formats are available for the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium held at the Chase Hotel in St. Louis for $27.00 each. .The speakers were Bill Moore, Stanton T. Friedman, Peter Gersten, John Schuessler, Leonard Stringfield, Budd Hopkins, George Fawcett, Ted Phillips and David Webb. A set of 4 tapes containing all lectures, special interview footage, and special speakers is also available as \"The Complete 1985 Symposium\" for $121.00. You may order your tapes from: Midwest Motion Picture Proteges, Inc., 9327 Corregidor, St. Louis, MO 63134 or by telephone (314) 423-2827. The Stars: The prominent Summer Triangle straddles the celestial meridian at 11 PM. To the west of it, find the dim constellations of Hercules and Ophiuchus. To the east, locate the Great Square of Pegasus. And below the Triangle in the south, look for Capricornus and Sagittarius. The Milk Way arches across the sky from north to south at this season. This river of starlight represents the edge-on view we have of our wheel-shaped home galaxy of billions of stars. The center of this huge star system is in the direction of Sagittarius. Get away from city lights to enjoy the fragile beauty of the Milky Way. CE-III, Continued there were many details we asked her for that she could not supply. This enhances her credibility, as unreliable witnesses tend to supply inaccurate or non-existent details to please their questioners. There are features of this report that indicate that more may have occurred than the witnesses recall. It is hard to understand why B. went into the house while two UFOs were in sight; he said he wasn't frightened. I wish we had pursued this point. Also, Mrs. Z's abdominal reaction is of interest, but it may have a prosaic explanation. She apparently did not connect it to her encounter experience, but brought it up as an after-thought when we asked about any possible after-effects of the experience. Some weeks after the sighting, Mrs. Z. read a book on UFOs; I believe it was Close Encounters of the Third Kind. In the back of the book, she found the address for CUFOS, and wrote a letter to Dr. Hynek describing her experience. Dr. Hynek then requested Don to investigate. What can one conclude from this case? There seems to be no evidence that the prime witness is lying, but no physical evidence or even tracks were found. Only one person reported seeing the creature. One can say that the details of the creature reported are farily consistent with a considerable number of other reports in the UFO literature. No attempt was made to seek publicity, and confidentiality was requested. On a credibility scale of 0 to 10, I would probably give this case between a 2 and a 4. The visit yielded other dividends. The Z's also told us about other UFO reports, some of them involving several of their neighbors, and another involving an aunt. Another case, potentially important, involved an object which came down over a local doctor's car, and left him very shaken. This could be worth a follow-up, if it is possible to get the doctor's cooperation. „ 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus It is a distinct pleasure to announce that Philip Mantle of West Yorkshire, England has accepted the position of Representative for England, replacing J. Bernard Delair. Philip is also the Overseas Liaison Officer for the Yorkshire UFO Society (YUFOS) that publishes the fine bi-monthly magazine Quest. Mr. Mantle has contributed articles to the MUFON UFO Journal. He was highly recommended to your Director by Timothy Good during -a personal meeting in Phoenix, Arizona. * * * Over 24 Journal readers inquired about additional sources of available material on the Billy Meier Case in Switzerland after reading \"The Meier Case\" by James W. Deardorff, Ph.D. in the November 1985 issue number 211 of the MUFON UFO Journal. In addition to the sources suggested by Dr. Deardorff, we wanted to also list the book titled \"The Meier Incident: The Most Infamous Hoax in Ufology,\" by Kal K. Korff with the editorial assistance of William L. Moore (copyright 1981). This book contains computerized enhancement of several photos by GSW, on the site field investigation by Colman Von Keviczky, (ICUFON, Inc.) and drawings showing hypothesized balloons courtesy of Garret Moore/Gravity Graphics. Kal Korffs book is now out of print, therefore it could not be listed as a reference in order to present a balanced pro and con view on this controversial case. The MUFON UFO Journal has published articles by both Wendelle Stevens and Kal K. Korff over the past few years in addition to the recent articles by James W. Deardorff, presenting both sides of the validity of the Meier Case. A source list was recently mailed to each of the readers seeking further information as promised. When Walt Andrus personally confronted Wendelle Stevens at \"UFO 79\" in San Diego, Calif, shortly after Philip Mantle \"UFO...Contact from the Pleiades,\" Volume I (picture book) was published, Wendelle was admonished not to use my name in any manner as an endorsement of the book. He and his colleagues had • implied that Jim Lorenzen, Internation Director for APRO endorsed Volume I in their colorful brochure, distributed during the Fall of 1979, by using this quote without Jim's approval: \"At least, the preponderance of material is too much for an objective mind to ignore in good conscience.\" When I privately challenged the credibility and authenticity of the objects portrayed in their picture book as actual UFOs, Wendelle Stevens retreated by replying \"I don't say any place in the book that they are real UFOs -- let's let the public decide for themselves.\" Thus the title of Kal Korffs book \"The Meier Incident -- The Most Infamous Hoax in Ufology\" is most appropriate. Unless startling new evidence, that can be documented by facts is forthcoming, the Billy Meier Case is closed as far as I am concerned. Each of the Journal readers has the prerogative of believing whatever they like or as Mr. Stevens has said \"let's let the public decide for themselves.\" (After you purchase their books, they really don't care, because they have pocketed your money.) * * •* For those of you who were unable to attend the MUFON Annual Corporate Meeting at East Lansing, Michigan on June 29,1986, some of the highlights and actions taken will be reported. (1) The MUFON 1987 UFO Symposium is scheduled for the weekend of June 26, 27 and 28,1987 at American University in Washington, D.C. and will be hosted by The Fund for UFO Research with Bruce Maccabee, Chairman and Fred Whiting, Symposium Coordinator. (2) Due to the proximity of Beverly, Mass, to Washington, D.C., the Massachusetts MUFON UFO Forum will not be held in 1987 so maximum emphasis and attendance may be achieved for the MUFON 1987 UFO International Symposium. (3) We will not schedule any regional UFO meetings in 1987 that would detract from Washington, D.C. (4) The MUFON plaque for outstanding work in the UFO field will become an annual award to bestow recognition upon the deserved recipient. (5) Richard H. Hall will prepare a letter to be mailed to all Acquisition Librarians throughout North America as an introductory step to securing more subscriptions and exposure to the MUFON UFO Journal. Marge Christensen is spearheading this vital educational program. (6) A draft copy of the \"MUFON Media Policy Statement\" will be distributed to all Board of Directors for their comments, revisions, and recommendations as a guideline to official representatives of MUFON when dealing with the printed and electronic news media. It is designed to build and maintain the credibility of the (continued on page 19)"}]
