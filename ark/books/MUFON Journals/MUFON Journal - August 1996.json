Some cinema complexes ran the movie — a high-tech update of H.G. Wells's \"War of the Worlds\" — continuously, day and night, during its initial premiere. Both \"Time\" and \"Newsweek\" chipped in with cover stories, and by the time the month was barely two weeks old, the subject of UFOs and alien invasion was being seen and heard everywhere, from CNN to ABC's \"Nightline.\" You had to be the Unabomber or some other 20th cen- tury hermit not to know that UFOs were in the air and on everyone's radar screens. T hey were definitely in the air and cavernous (and often confusing) halls of the Holiday Inn Four Seasons/Joseph H. Koury Convention Center in Greensboro, where the symposium was held under auspices of the MUFON North Carolina chap- ter, assistant state director George E. Lund III, serving as Host Chairperson. Natalie \"Ginger\" Richardson was the Mistress of Ceremonies. International Director Walt Andrus, Jr., welcomed everyone on the behalf of MUFON. Appropriately enough, given the unprecedented pub- licity surrounding \"Independence Day,\" opening speaker Kevin Randle addressed the issue of \"Does Pop Culture Affect our Views?\" If the conclusion wasn't foregone before Randle gave his talk, it should have been obvious by the time he finished. The day when ufology could conduct its investigations in a clean laboratory room clearly separated from cultural notions and perceptions of alien images and preconceptions is long gone, if, in- deed, it ever existed at all. The 1947 Arnold sighting hardly took place in a vac- cuum. nor, for that matter, did the Roswell Incident itself of a few weeks later. Science fiction images of aliens and their spaceships had already polluted the UFO pool beyond any sense of sacrosanct purity. Wells wrote the original \"War of the Worlds\" in 1897; by 1938, another Welles, Orson, had adapted it into the form of a live ra- dio broadcast that literally panicked thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, with its semi-plausible tale of hostile Martian invaders. Unfortunately, fictional Martians soon took second seat to an all too real Adolph Kevin D. Randle \"Does Pop Culture Affect Our Views?\" Hitler and Third Reich. By the early 1950s, however, the dread Martians were back, in George Pal's technicolor presentation of Wells's classic novel. The rest, as they say. is TV and cinema history, with a straight line drawn from early pioneers like \"The Twilight Zone\" and \"Outer Limits,\" through \"Star Trek,\" to Spielberg's \"Close AUGUST 1996 NUMBER 34O PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Encounters\" and \"E-T,\" and today's latest remake of the \"War of the Worlds.\" Interestingly, according to Randle, an episode of \"Outer Limits\" involving aliens with \"wraparound eyes\" aired only 12 days before Barney Hill recalled and drew similar beings while under hypnosis. Even if we ignore the visual images of aliens in recent pop culture, says Randle. there is still the vast literary body of pulp sci- ence fiction magazines from the 30s and 40s to be waded through, along with reports of the great airships of 1897. In short, he concludes, \"we see the media loaded with everything that is found in the UFO sight- ings and abduction reports of today. It is important to un- derstand that nothing that abductees report is unique to the phenomenon. There are cultural precedents as well as the folklore traditions.\" John S. Carpenter. M.S.W. \"The Significance of Multiple Participant Abductions\" T he morning's second speaker was John Carpenter of Missouri on the subject of 'The Significance of Multiple Participant Abductions.\" Carpenter's abstract from the published Proceedings: \"Multiple participant abductions are accounts in which two or more persons share the recall of a UFO abduction scenario, often having initially shared a simultaneous pe- riod of amnesia or \"missing time.\" They can usually de- scribe the same details of perceived events and ob- served beings, including bizarre procedures, confusing exams, and inexplicable behaviors which defy conven- tional laws of physics. Events are usually detailed in the same order and sequence. The participants can usually describe what each other was doing at any given mo- ment as well as how they appeared or reacted emotion- ally. Each participant tells his recollections from his own unique perspective. This creates a set of details that will not perfectly match the accounts of the other participants 100 per cent, but will overlap with their perspectives, creating a remarkable and often impressive subset of matching details. It is this kind of correlating data that helps each participant feel that his bizarre and confusing recollections have really been shared and verified by another \"eyewitness.\" These detailed corre- lations propel this data and these accounts of alleged UFO experiences beyond conventional skepticism and popular explanations. \"The significance of these investigated cases of mul- tiple participants occurs when attempting to apply tra- ditional explanations and finding that the data refuses to support such theories.\" One of the specific explanations Carpenter addressed was just the one raised earlier by Randle — pop culture in its many forms. \"The natural assumption these days,\" he said, \"is that the abundance of science fiction imagery in movies such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind. television programs such as numerous Star Trek reruns, documentaries about UFOs, tabloid publications, and an endless supply of books available on UFOs would make it seem rather easy for two or more people to produce similar outer space imagery.\" But Carpenter found several factors which this sce- nario fails to take into account: \"1) emotional accounts from pre-school-age children who could not have read these materials, nor fully understood adult talk shows or movies; 2) unpublished details not available to the gen- eral public; 3) bizarre details of UFO abduction scenar- ios that are not part of our typical science fiction themes, i.e., \"floating through walls\" and \"red balls of light transforming into little men\"; and 4) the fact that most actual subjects have little to no interest and just an av- erage exposure to such influences.\" Recently, Carpenter noted, \"Dr. John Mack of Harvard investigated and interviewed 62 school children in Africa who claimed to have witnessed a daytime UFO sighting with at least two small gray beings in- volved — all consciously. Yet none of these African schoolchildren knew anything about popularized alien accounts in America. Their reports were sincere, con- sistent, and credible as a group.\" He himself, he continued, \"can describe at least six- teen investigated cases with multiple participants from his own caseload of 150 accounts. Of those sixteen cases, nine, or 56 per cent, involve both participants reporting that they both were abducted. Five cases, or 31 per cent, described one person abducted and the other left behind. Two cases, or 13 per cent, felt that an ab- duction may have occurred, but neither was actually taken. Despite these varying scenarios, the most sig- nificant statistic is that in all (100 per cent) of these sixteen cases, whatever was reported and believed to have occurred was verified accurately by all witnesses involved — all of the time. Had these been fantasies, PAGE 4 NUMBER 340 AUGUST 1996"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL delusions, or other suggestive experiences, it would be a big stretch to accept that such independent creations could match so neatly. And these astoundingly similar reports, obtained separately, describe not only matching physical details, but correlations regarding the sequence of events, emotional reactions, confusing physics, and observations of each other. Citing several cases from his own experience, Carpenter concluded that \"multiple participant abduc- tions offer a type of convincing 'evidence' for the real- ity of extraterrestrial contacts that gives traditional skep- ticism and conventional explanations much more diffi- culty. Specific correlating data from independent ses- sions of separate witnesses suggests a core reality to these emotional and convincing experiences. Expressed in experiential terms, these accounts fail to follow sug- gestive remarks and remain consistent — despite being verbalized from varying perspectives of different human beings. These types of reports and careful investiga- tions should add an important chapter of validity to the body of UFO research data. It is time that we recognize that an acceptance of this phenomenon may explain these reports with more satisfaction than does the bizarreness of many skeptical claims.\" Chris Styles \"Shag Harbour in Perspective\" A fter lunch, Canadian UFO researcher Chris Styles re- lated the details of what may be the most thor- oughly documented UFO crash on record, Roswell in- cluded. \"On the night of October 4, 1967, shortly after 11 p.m.,\" said Styles, \"a UFO was seen hovering over the water near the fishing village of Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia. The object was estimated to be at least 60 feet in diameter. It displayed four bright lights flashing in sequence. After several minutes the UFO tilted to a 45-degree angle and descended rapidly towards the wa- ter's surface. The impact produced a bright flash and the sound of an explosion. Several witnesses reported the event to the nearby Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment in Barrington Passage. \"Most of the callers claimed they saw a large aircraft ditch into the water. Others saw only what they could de- scribe as lights plummeting downward. Concern was expressed by many of the callers about the possibility of survivors. Interestingly, no one reported a UFO as such.\" However, like so many UFO cases — unfortunately — Shag Harbour languished from a lack of money and manpower. Indeed, it was only some 26 years after the event that Styles himself decided to reopen the case, his memory jarred by a spring 1993 rebroadcast of an \"Unsolved Mysteries\" segment about the Roswell Incident.          } Somewhat to his surprise, Styles found a well docu- mented paper trail of both an official and unofficial na- ture. \"The Shag Harbour Incident left behind it an in- credible legacy of documentation,\" he said. \"It includes not only hundreds of press clippings from local and in- ternational sources, but dozens of military and RCNP re- ports that have been preserved in Canada's National Archives. Most of the preserved material is unrestricted and freely available through the Inter-Library Loaner system. Examples are included within this symposium paper. The Directorate of History of Canada's Department of National Defense Headquarters holds a few papers that deal with the Shag Harbour UFO crash. They also have copies of correspondence between the Defense Minister's office and various officials at the National Research Council that chronicle the transfer of UFO responsibilities from the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) \"Air Desk\" in Ottawa to the NRC. The Shag Harbour Incident weighed heavily in that deci- sion. A brief report of the case was usually included as an attachment with most of the inter-departmental corre- spondence. \"One important private source of documents was the personal papers of the late Jesuit priest Father Michael Burke-Gaffney. Father Gaffney was a noted astronomer, professor, author, and UFO investigator who worked for Canada's National Research Council. His papers are archived at St. Mary's University in Halifax. As explained in the previous section, the paper only files that are the Father's legacy are now an open file and available by arrangement with the St. Mary's University Archivist. The ten Shag Harbour documents that are among the eclectic collection are found in Box #1 of the 26 storage boxes, which are poorly organized. Three documents are RCMP X-files. \"Another unexpected source of worthwhile docu- ments has been the ambitious Project 1947 effort un- dertaken by Connecticut-based UFO researcher Jan Aldrich. Project 1947 has taken Jan to many eclectic sources of press clippings as he gathers any and every- AUGUST 1996 NUMBER 340 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL thing in print about UFOs from the dawn of the modern UFO era and before. Several forwarded items proved ex- tremely useful.\" In particular, said Styles, \"while researching the files of UFO researcher John Brent Musgrave, Aldrich dis- covered a copy of an old APRO Preliminary Investigation Report on the Shag Harbour Incident, pre- pared by a Nova Scotian APRO investigator for the late Jim Lorenzen. The articulate, seven-page report was prepared while the Shag Harbour crash was still fresh in the minds of the officers who seemed most ac- commodating. Their ranks, names, and office phone numbers at Maritime Command are all included in this fascinating paper. It describes curious intrusions of United State Air Force (USAF) activity over the impact site hours after the event and includes many other de- tails, such as the identity of the scientific consultant the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) put on standby to re- ceive artifacts. Certainly this report was APRO's impe- tus for referring it to the Condon Committee.\" Curiously, Dr. Norman Levine, considered one of the Committee's \"believers,\" recommended against an on- site inspection at the time, citing \"the immediate and thorough search that had been carried out by the RCMP and the Maritime Command.\" (The case is #34 in the Condon Report.) Publicly, the Canadians maintained that \"something,\" described as \"no known object,\" had crashed in their coastal waters, but that the seven divers sent down to look for debris had found nothing. Styles found and interviewed some of the divers, who requested anonymity. Other witnesses to the dives said they saw \"aluminum-like\" material brought up. With funding provided by the Fund for UFO Research and the TV show \"Sightings,\" Styles was able to arrange a sidescan sonar survey of the suspected area in September of 1995. Although hampered by weather conditions and time constraints, sonar implied \"four circular objects in the five meter (16 feet) range.\" The data needs to be professionally interpreted and ana- lyzed, however, which will require another four to five thousand dollars Canadian. T o best enjoy Jeff Sainio's talk, illustrated with nu- merous slides and video clips, you literally had to be there (although a number of stills have been reproduced with his printed paper in the Proceedings). Seeing, after all, is believing — or is it? Well, not quite, according to Sainio, MUFON's staff photoanalyst for still and video photography. UFO pho- tos can lie, too, both to the original photographer and to subsequent viewers. The most frequently photographed \"UFO\" Sainio sees these days is, in fact, the perenially popular planet Venus, usually recorded with a hand- held camcorder. (Venus is now the brightest it's been in 16 years.) An artefact of camcorder technology creates dark areas around pin-points of bright light, lending the light the illusion of structure in some instances, or what Jeffrey W. Sainio \"X-Files. Lies and Videotapes: A Photo-Video Update\" has been interpreted as an \"energy ring\" or \"power vor- tex\" in others. A thorough analysis, when performed correctly, will usually reveal most photographic \"lies,\" however. The mistake most novice investigators make at the outset, said Sainio, \"is the failure to perform a control experi- ment, or reference shot.\" Ideally, this should be done with the original equipment used to take the submitted picture. Pictures of the site at which the photo or video was taken can also prove useful. For instance, was there a tree just outside the picture frame from which a small model could have been suspended? Common assumptions are that an object's three-di- mensional shape can be determined from a flat picture of it (false), or that computer enhancement can add new in-* formation to the object photographed (also false). \"An extreme blowup of a tiny blob will simply result in a large blob,\" said Sainio. Photographic information, then, is primarily a result of focus and film grain, or, for videotape, the number of scan lines forming the image and the response characteristics of the tape. Unfortunately, Sainio lamented, while the number of consumer camcorders in use has multiplied exponen- tially in recent years, their average quality hasn't. (If you're serious about trying to capture a UFO on video- tape, opt for the higher priced Hi-8 or S-VHS video formats and then hope the UFO cooperates!) \"The future of UFO image analysis depends on the evidence analyzed,\" Sainio concluded. \"The evidence, in turn, depends on the amount of equipment available (increasing nicely), its quality (barely improving), and peoples' willingness to submit the evidence. Since the PAGE 6 NUMBER 340 AUGUST 1996"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL vast majority of evidence comes from the public, one must gain the public's knowledge and respect as a pro- fessional, trustworthy investigator. When many new members join a UFO organization looking for exciting cases and careful analysis, and instead find bickering over trivia, personal attacks, and pseudoscience, they are unlikely to be interested in advancing the science of ufology. The future of ufology depends on the profes- sionalism of ufologists.\" Vincent F. DiPietro \"Evidence for Life Beyond the Mars Face\" V incent DiPietro's slide-illustrated talk was also best enjoyed in person, although, again, a number of his many slides have been reproduced with his paper in the published symposium Proceedings. So much has been said and speculated about the famous \"Face on Mars\" and other alleged Martian artifacts in the last few months and years, that it was refreshing to hear a thoughtful, conservative presentation by one of the first pioneers in the field. For 22 years, DiPietro has been a systems engineer contractor with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in the primary field of image pro- cessing. It was in 1979 that he first became interested in photographs of the Cydonia region of Mars taken by Viking 1 three years earlier. In 1984. with Dr. John Brandenburg and colleague Gregory Molenaar, DiPietro founded Mars Research. With Molenaar, DiPietro also developed a new en- hancement technique known as Starburst Pixel Interleaving Technique, or S.P.I.T., a play on the idea of the \"spitting image\" of something. Using the S.P.I.T. process, they were able to demonstrate that Viking 1 Frame 70AI3 of the so-called Face indeed demonstrated bisymmetry, including a second eye cavity, or socket. Whatever the feature was, then, it was not simply a \"quirk of light,\" as one critic had earlier dismissed it. Using a false color process, the pair was also able to distinguish what appears to be an eyeball feature in the eye socket lit by sunlight. A different process, employed by Dr. Mark Calotto, reveals what appear to be teeth in the mouth area. The S.P.I.T. process, applied to another nearby artificial-appearing feature indicates that what some researchers have referred to as a five-sided pyra- mid, the so-called D&M Pyramid, looks to be four- sided instead. Of the many alleged alignments among various Martian features that some researchers have claimed, DiPietro supports only that between the Face and the D&M Pyramid. Many others, he said, are too far apart to permit a line-of-sight view from the red planet's surface. Budd Hopkins \"The Sixth Witness in the Linda Cortile Abduction Case\" A sixth eyewitness to the Linda \"Cortile\" abduction has come forward, according to Budd Hopkins, whose book on the case — Witnessed: The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions — should ap- pear soon, perhaps by the time you read this. As with the other five alleged eyewitnesses to the case, Cathy Turner, now deceased, surfaced in a round- about fashion. As it happened, a friend of Budd's, a bi- ology professor at a major university, had for some- time been conducting an online dialogue about UFOs on CompuServe with Cathy's nephew, Frank Turner. Intriguingly. another of Turner's CompuServe corre- spondents was one of a trio of active critics of the Cortile case. In the summer of 1993, Budd's friend received an on- line message from Turner, who had just spoken to his aunt. They had been speaking about books, and Cathy said she didn't like Whitley Strieber's books because they were too scary. \"Yeah,\" Frank told her, \"he claims to have been taken by a UFO.\" Cathy then told him AUGUST 1996 NUMBER 340 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL that she had once seen a UFO, and when her nephew asked where, she said near the Brooklyn Bridge. Eventually, Budd was put in touch with Frank Turner and able to arrange an interview with his aunt, who spoke of a red. pulsating something hovering in the air near an apartment building. She did not report seeing anyone float out of the building and into the UFO, as others have, however, nor did she have a clear memory of the car in which she was riding coming to a complete stop. \"I do know we were going slower than usual,\" she said. In December of 1993, Frank, Cathy and Budd revis- ited the site in person by car. Her driver at the time of her original sighting, referred to only as Robert, appar- ently suffers from Post Traumatic Stress syndrome as a consequence of his Viet Nam experience. He has been interviewed, too, but now refuses to elaborate upon his own involvement. Cathy Turner, who suffered from di- abetes, passed away in July of 1994. A. |. Gevaerd \"The Current Brazilian UFO Wave\" S aturday evening's program saw not just one or two \"keynote\" speakers, as at past symposia, but three. The first of these was A.J. Gevaerd, MUFON's National Director for Brazil, and a last-minute substitution for Whitley Streiber. Gevaerd's subject matter was the on- going UFO flap in Brazil that seems to have culmi- nated in the alleged capture by Brazilian military au- thorities, earlier this year, of two \"creatures\" in the city of Varginha, in the state of Minas Gerais, in the central part of the country. On the afternoon of Saturday, January 20, three young girls were returning home from their jobs when they no- ticed a dark brown creature with a small body, perhaps four to five feel tall, kneeling nearby, seemingly as if in pain. It appeared to have a dark, greasy oil on its skin, no hair, a small mouth and nose, a large head with red eyes, and a distinct odor. It also was described as having three protuberances or \"horns\" on its head. After a few minutes, the three girls fled, fearing they had just en- countered the devil. No UFO was reported. Later, two local UFO researchers, Dr. Ubirakara Franco Rodrigues and Victorio Paccuccini, reportedly uncovered reports of a second creature and its capture by Brazilian Army and Fire Department authorities. Interviews with anonymous individuals were conducted and stories emerged of the creatures being taken first to a nearby hospital, and then transferred to the University of Campinas, about 200 miles away. Soldiers and nurses interviewed supposedly spoke only under guarantee of anonymity. Virtually every authority identified in such accounts, according to the Wall Street Journal, denied any involvement and dismissed the entire story. The WSJ also reported that at least two of the original wit- nesses were now charging $200 for an interview. Philip Mantle \"The Roswell Film Footage\" P hilip Mantle, MUFON Representative for England, updated events swirling around the highly charged and controversial Roswell \"alien autopsy'' film footage made public by Ray Santilli, Managing Director of the Merlin Group, London, which distributes audio, video and book products. About two years ago. Mantle received a phone call from Santilli, who was considering doing a UFO docu- mentary for his company to distribute. The documentary was never made, but during this time Santilli let it be known that, while in the U.S. in search of early Elvis Presley film, he had purchased some footage from a former military photographer. The date would seem to have been June. 1993. Mantle made several requests to view the film, but these weren't granted until March 17, 1995. (Reg PAGES NUMBER 340 AUGUST 1996"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Presley of the rock group The Troggs had seen the film approximately a year earlier.) At the same meeting, Mantle asked Santilli to speak at the upcoming Sheffield UFO conference in August, sponsored by the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA), for which Mantle is Director of Investigations. Meanwhile, word of the film's existence was begin- ning to leak out, so on May 5, 1995, Santilli showed part of the film in his possession at the Museum of London before an invited audience of about 200. And the rest, us they say, is history, even though no one has been able to pry loose the exact details of the film's history from Mr. Santilli, or, apparently, been able to convince him to sub- mit the film for authorative analysis by Kodak or anyone else, although he has reportedly agreed to do this on more than one occasion. In the absence of conclusive evidence, and in the presence of several contradictory accounts about the film's origins and the identity of the cameraman (even the number of film canisters purchased seems to change monthly), the UFO community split into two emotional camps — those who felt it was the real thing, and those who believed it to be one of the greatest cons of the 20th or any other century. Mantle tries manfully to take a middle road, but the fact of the matter is that the one man responsible for most of the confusion — and who could do the most to establish its authenticity, or lack of same — refuses to hand over any physical frames of the film for verifiable analysis. Mantle seems to think this may yet happen, but Santilli has had the film in his possession for over three years now without any serious indication of having it an- alyzed. There's no real reason to think his mind will change anytime in the future — because that could mean the ink might finally dry on the alleged Roswell alien autopsy film. John E. Mack, M.D. \"Studying Intrusions from the Subtle Realm: How Can We Deepen Our Knowledge?\" T he last speaker of the evening was Dr. John Mack, author of Abductions: Human Encounters with Aliens, and a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School, Cambridge. Mack's nearly six-year study of the UFO abduction phenomenon has convinced him — as it convinced Jacques Vallee, John Keel and others before him — that science may not be the best or most appropriate approach to the subject, after all. Make that a certain type of science. In Mack's own words, \"By and large science, as it is traditionally spo- ken of, has addressed, and its methodology has been ap- propriate to, the gross material, the physical, or manifest world, and the approach to this world has been largely dualistic: an observer studies something from outside of or separate from that person or phenomenon. We know that some of the best scientists do not think of their work in that way, but, nevertheless, that is the standard that we often think we mean, or are told we mean, by the 'scientific method.' I might add that in the focus on the material realm to the exclusion of the subtle realms, we have virtually rid the cosmos of nature, rid nature of spirit and, in a sense, denied the existence of all life other than that which is physically observable here on earth.\" But as we all know, UFOs have the perplexing, al- most perverse, propensity of manifesting in ways that of- ten seem non-material, even to the point of absurdity. And of course this propensity is nowhere more manifest than in the abduction phenomenon, wherein witnesses report being \"beamed\" or transported through solid ob- jects into a luminous, circular realm where space isn't al- ways what it seems, and time itself may go \"missing.\" \"What do I mean by the subtle realm?\" Mack asked. \"As I began to think about it more deeply, I realized this is not so easy to pin down. It has to do with phe- nomena that seem to come from another dimension: information obtained telepathically; clairvoyance and the whole psi realm; out-of-body experiences; near- death experiences; telekinesis and the alien abduction phenomenon itself—i.e., phenomena that may manifest in the physical world, but seem to originate in another dimension, to come from a place unseen. We are speak- ing of matters which are not readily observable under ordinary \"separatist,\" dualistic scientific or method- ological conditions, but make their presence known more subtly through an opening of consciousness or more receptive perception.\" Phenomena that don't rock the boat — that remain manifestly material or subtle — are easier to deal with than ones that do. But when a phenomenon jumps the gap, so to speak, science and some societies tend to get apprehensive or \"edgy.\" Abductions, said Mack, seem to be such a phenomenon. \"I think it is the one that by its very nature 'grabs' us where we live, precisely because it crosses over and manifests in the form or language that we do understand in this culture — spaceships, abduc- tions, implants, instruments, surgery, hybrids, babies, re- production, etc. All that seems very physical and ought AUGUST 1996 NUMBER 340 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL to be reducible to study by the dualistic methods of tra- ditional science. But the alien abduction phenomenon does not seem to yield its secrets to that approach. The phenomenon challenges vigorously that sacred barrier we have created between the unseen and the material world. It undermines the fundamental world view of the Western mind.\" Continuing, Mack added that \"It is easy for people who use a dualistic approach to say, 'You're contami- nating the field. You're influencing, you're leading,' when, in fact, you are joining the other person in bring- ing forth experiences. But you cannot get away from the fact that in any exploration of human experience two consciousnesses, two energy fields, are interacting or connecting and that what emerges is out of that partici- pation, out of the relationship. Then, after that, you look at what you have found and apply rational judg- ment in analyzing the material. You ask, was this person trying to please? Was this authentic? What was the emotional intensity that came with the communica- tions? Was this emotion appropriate to what the person was talking about? These are the yardsticks that psy- chological clinicians apply in assessing what a patient or client is reporting. It has nothing to do with belief. In my abduction cases, with few exceptions, I have felt people were describing as best they could what had occurred. In fact, they doubt as much as I do what they have under- gone. They tend to come to me saying, 'Can you make this go away?' or will report waking experiences as dreams if they occurred at night. They want the experi- ences to be found to be a product of their psyches, not to be 'real.' In case after case I have seen the lips quiver or tears come down the cheeks when the person realizes that he was not asleep and that what occurred was not a dream. I might then say, 'Yes, I'm sorry, but I know many people who have had experiences like yours.' One woman who came to me a few days ago, and was eager to believe her experiences were dreams, said to me sobbing 'But if it's real, then it can happen again. And I can't stop it and you can't stop it.' These individuals pre- fer that this be a clinical phenomenon that will go away, or that I might cure it by giving them a pill, or talking them out of it or interpreting it in some dynamic sense, which of course is what many of my colleagues want to do as well.\" At the same time, said Mack, \"the basic phenomena associated with abductions seem to be consistent world- wide. But paradoxes abound, and it is difficult to make statements that apply in all cases. For example, I do not believe that in every abduction case the physical body is taken. Yet there are cases in which the person is witnessed to be not there. A child, for example, may go into the mother's room at night and the mother is gone, and the mother reports an abduction experience that occurred at that time. But there are also cases where the person reports experiencing an abduction and other peo- ple have observed seeing the person still in place. \"But the basic phenomena: seeing a beam of light; the intrusion of humanoid beings into the person's life; the experience of being paralyzed and taken through walls into some kind of enclosure and subjected to a variety of procedures with the creation of a 'hybrid' species; the conveying of powerful information about threats to the planet such as nuclear war and vast ecological change; the evidences of an expansion of consciousness that occurs for the people who undergo these experiences, for people that work with them and for those who will at- tend to what this appears to be about—these all seem to be quite consistent findings. \"My colleague, Dominique Callimanopulos, and I have traveled to South Africa, to Brazil, and a number of countries in Europe. We are also getting reports from all over the world and learning that the basic phenome- non appears to have a consistent core. I have worked with a South African medicine man. Credo Mutwa, a Zulu leader now 74, who had a classic abduction expe- rience when he was 38. This occurred during his training as a shaman. Mr. Mutwa was in the bush when suddenly he found himself in an enclosure surrounded by hu- manoid beings with large black eyes. He was terrified, and underwent the range of traumatic, educational and transformational experiences described above. He be- lieves the 'mandindas,' as his people call these beings, are trying to teach us about the threat to the earth that our mindless destructive actions are causing.\" In conclusion, offered Mack, \"the alien abduction phenomenon appears to be a kind of spiritual outreach program from the cosmos for the spiritually impaired.\" Carlos A. Guzman Rojas \"A Chronology of Ufology in Mexico\" PAGE 10 NUMBER 340 AUGUST 1996"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL S unday saw the international aspect of the UFO phe- nomenon re-emphasized with presentations by Carlos Guzman Rojas (on UFOs in Mexico) and Antonio Huneeus (UFOs virtually everywhere else, in- cluding Belgium, Chile, Argentina. Costa Rica, Australia, Russia. Italy, France and Spain). Unfortunately, this reporter was unable to attend the morning and early afternoon speeches in person as he was in the MUFON Board of Directors meeting, which ran over because of a lengthy agenda. The results of that meeting, in which several pressing issues were resolved, will be made known in a future Director's Message by Walt Andrus. Brief extracts or summaries from Sunday's papers, then, as published in the Proceedings, follow. Carlos Guzman Rojas is MUFON's State Director for the Federal District of Mexico City and director of Mexico's Center of Research for UFO Phenomenon (CIFEEEAC). Rojas's slide-illustrated talk covered un- usual aerial phenomena reported over his nation from the time of the Aztecs up until the modern UFO era. The earliest cases are cast in such descriptively vague terms that they could easily apply either to local folklore and religious traditions, or to actual observations of atmos- pheric and meteorological phenomena (or both), al- though many resonate with similarities to modern UFO cases. As in the U.S., the modern UFO era in Mexico can be said to commence with the Kenneth Arnold sighting in the summer of 1947. Shortly afterwards, UFOs were re- ported from Mexicali and Ciudad Juarez. The coun- try's first flap took place in 1950. followed by similar flaps in 1953, 1957, 1965 (the largest) and later. Contemporaneous with Adamski in this country, the John W. White \"UFOs — In Search of an Overview\" first contactee, Don Salvador Villanueva Medina, sur- faced in Mexico. Yet the first full-length book about UFOs published in Mexico, Flying Saucers, Reality and Fantasy, by William Jones, rapidly emulated by others, did not appear until 1955. Sightings decreased in the 80s, but resurged in the 90s, fueled by literally hundreds of videos taken over Mexico City and environs during a solar eclipse. Many of these videos were of the planet Venus, however. J ohn W. White offered a survey of the many various phenomena huddled under the UFO umbrella by di- viding them into three broad categories with examples from each. The most familiar category, of course, is the extraterrestrial, those reports of UFOs, with or with- out occupants, that appear, for all the world, to be of a physical, alien and extraterrestrial nature, that is, space- ships from another planet. Here he cited the Hill Abduction and the Roswell incident. A second category is the terrestrial, the possibility that at least some UFOs, or what are reported as UFOs, have their origins here on Earth. This area could in- clude terrestrial military technology, too, but White chose to focus on UFO theories suggested by Ivan Sanderson, Trevor James Constable and Paul Devereux. Because UFOs have been reported both entering and ex- iting the sea, biologist Sanderson, in Invisible Residents, suggested that another, underwater, civilization might have evolved on Earth, and that it is their UFOs which are being reported. Even more curious is the theory propounded by Constable in The Cosmic Pulse of Life, which argues that some UFOs are what the author called \"critters,\" low- level, amoebalike creatures that inhabit the upper at- mosphere and are typically only visible in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. When they slip into the visible light range, they are reported as UFOs. More credible is the \"earth light\" theory pro- pounded by English researcher Devereux in a series of books examining luminous atmospheric phenomena and related Earth mysteries. White's third category is the metaterrestrial, a word first coined by J. Allen Hynek in an attempt to encom- pass those UFO reports which seem to combine purely physical aspects of the phenomenon with ones decidedly non-physical, or \"paranormal.\" As typically used, the word refers to some other higher dimension being able to manifest in our 3-D space-time. Aspects of same are seemingly seen in certain folklore and religious tradi- tions, including the \"day the sun danced\" over Fatima, Portugal, on October 13, 1917. There is a warning chord to be struck here, however. Many \"metaterrestrials\" hold out a promise of a higher technology (or spirituality) that will solve our many problems, energy, pollution, a shortage of natural re- sources, internecine warfare, and otherwise. In short, universal salvation is offered from the outside. \"But AUGUST 1996 NUMBER 340 PAGE I 1"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ). Antonio Huneeus \"A Reference Guide to Foreign UFO Documents\" what is 'out there' cannot save us,\" said White. \"The im- pulse to grow and evolve must come from within. Let us therefore beware of false gods.\" M uch has been made of the global nature of the UFO phenomenon, but almost as much has been made of an alleged coordinated conspiracy by governments world- wide, supposedly orchestrated or imposed by the last of the Super Powers, the United States, to cover up the phe- nomenon. (See, for example, the books of Timothy Good.) This concept would also involve a judicious ap- plication of disinformation every now and then in order to discredit and ridicule the phenomenon. The peripatetic Antonio Huneeus, MUFON's International Coordinator and Fate Magazine UFO Editor, examined such claims and found them largely wanting. \"Popular as this concept may be in ufological circles,\" Huneeus said, \"I have found very little evidence to sup- port it. True, there are scattered UFO-related documents from several intelligence, diplomatic, military and sci- entific agencies or sources from perhaps 20 or 25 coun- tries. Having kept an international perspective for almost 20 years, traveling widely in South America. Europe and Asia, and acquiring extensive foreign files. I can offer the following tentative guidelines. \"1. Very few governments have undertaken formal UFO studies over extended periods. Besides the USA (Project Blue Book. Condon Commission), I can think of only Canada (Projects Magnet and Second Storey), France (GEPAN and SEPRA) and the old USSR (stud- ies under the umbrella of the Academy of Sciences; some collection efforts by the Armed Forces and KGB). \"2. Reporting UFOs falls generally under the purview of the air force (sometimes the navy or police) in a dozen countries or so, including the UK, Spain, Italy and Brazil. Certain procedures to file and follow-up UFO re- ports by pilots and other military personnel exist, but no formal studies per se. The personnel is usually very limited, as in the case of the one-man office at the British Ministry of Defense Secretariat Air Staff (AS2a). \"3. Moreover, these investigations are primarily de- fense-oriented—i.e., is the UFO potentially hostile or not? Secondly, they had a higher priority status during, the Cold War. In other words, a great percentage of US and foreign UFO documents were of interest to the au- thorities because an object, so far unidentified, had been reported; the primary concern was that it could be a Soviet intruder (or American in the case of the USSR) rather than alien. In other examples like Belgium, it was a matter of reacting to a major ongoing wave; once the number of sightings and media interest decreased, so did the official involvement. \"4. In general, obtaining official documents any- where is a difficult and sometimes impossible task. Governments and particularly military and intelligence agencies operate under strict rules of secrecy every- where. Very few countries have laws like the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) providing a lecal mechanism to request documents. Moreover, once acquired, the docu- ments are likely written in other languages, whereby its translation and digest become a' difficult and often ex- pensive task. Dr. Roger K. Leir \"Medical and Surgical Aspects of the UFO Abduction Phenomenon\" \"5. There is no official UFO investigation of any kind in the great majority of less developed countries, whether in Latin America, Africa or Asia. The resources of most countries are far too stretched to devote any time tracking UFOs. There might be one or two exceptions, perhaps in- volving a particular spectacular incident, but no more. PAGE 12 NUMBER 340 AUGUST 1996"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"Notwithstanding all of the above, a systematic search, translation and analysis of available foreign of- ficial documentation should be undertaken and evaluated before reaching more definite conclusions. Perhaps there is an international UFO conspiracy, after all, but I some- how doubt it. This doesn't mean that I am implying that UFOs don't exist. On the contrary, UFOs are a bur- densome problem for bureaucracies anywhere.\" I n June of 1995, Dr. Roger K. Leir, a south California podiatrist and MUFON Consultant in Medicine, agreed to surgically extract three alleged implants from two Texas abductees under investigation by Derrell Sims of Houston. The surgery was conducted two months later, and three small items were extracted. The proce- dures were recorded on both 35mm film and videotape. (See the MUFON Journal No. 336 for April, 1996.) All three objects obtained were extremely small. A triangular-shaped item, the largest, was one-half cen- timeter in each direction, while two other objects, about the size and shape of cantaloupe seeds, were a mere two to four millimeters. All three were covered with a tough gray membrane later determined to be of \"pro- teinacious coagulum\" (blood protein) and \"keratin\" (the substance that makes up hair and nails). \"The objects,\" Leir noted, \"appeared to be magnetic [as they] clung to the scalpel blade.\" They are currently in the process of being analyzed, he added, \"so it would be premature to comment about them at this time.\" Requests for similar extractions have come from a number of reported abductees. To accommodate these and future supplicants, Leir and Sims have formed the non-profit organization, F.I.R.S.T., Fund for Interactive Research in Space Technology, Inc. T he UFO phenomenon displays no shortage of be- havioral oddities. Among other unusual manuevers, abrupt right-angle turns have been reported by wit- nesses, along with the ability to decelerate and acceler- ate seemingly \"instantly.\" Looking at this last phenom- enon, and using several recent videos to illustrate his talk, was Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Sunday's concluding speaker. Some of the video Maccabee analyzed was supplied by Ed Walters of Gulf Breeze fame. A brief video captured by Walters on July 21, 1995, shows a circular object entering the camera's field of view from the left, travel a short distance, and then dis- appear almost immediately back to the left. The ob- ject's shadow can also be seen. While some sort of hoax cannot absolutely be ruled out, Maccabee con- cludes that the difficulties involved rule out one by Ed. Much of Maccabee's analysis was of a technical na- ture, and so no summary will be attempted here. Interested parties are referred instead to the complete pa- per in the published Proceedings. In conclusion, said Maccabee, \"Recent videos show UFOs accelerating and even 'disappearing.' These videos provide, for the first time, quantitative evidence that UFOs are capable of extreme acceleration and speed, which raises several questions: How was the ac- celeration achieved in the absence of any apparent means of propulsion (no rocket blasts, no explosions, no obvious electric or magnetic phenomena)? Why was there no noise associated with the departure? What hap- pened to the occupants, if any? \"These are questions that have been asked repeatedly over the last (nearly) fifty years. Because these questions have been based on visual obversations of possibly questionable accuracy in the past, they have generally been treated lightly (if at all!) by scientists. But now, with some 'hard' data to go on, it appears that we must confront the ridiculous (by our standards) evidence that phenomenal acceleration, apparently without the usual action-reaction, is possible.\" Dennis Stacy is the Journal's editor.

For many years, Gribble wrote a monthly column for this journal called \"Looking Back.\" The center's current director is Peter Davenport (ufocntr@nwlink.com). Their UFO Report Hotline number, widely distributed among var- ious aviation, meteorological and law enforcement agencies, is (206) 722-3000. NUFORCs WWW page can be found at http://www.nwlink.com/~ufocntr. The page contains a summary by month of reports recently received, as well as Case Briefs, which are more de- tailed investigations, and of which the following is an example. We'll be using additional information from NUFORC in future issues. T his case, reported to us on March 03, 1995, we fea- ture for several reasons. First, it was reported by a very sincere and responsible-sounding woman from Sedalia, Missouri, who reported that not only she, but her neighbor, as well, had witnessed the object hovering over her farm for approximately five minutes two days earlier. Moreover, she is a professional artist, and she re- ported that while the object hovered over her farm at a distance from her of not more than an eighth of a mile, she attempted consciously to \"take in,\" and commit to memory, specific detail she observed on the object in or- der to be able to draw the item at a later date. At 1516 hrs. on March 3, the Hotline received a tele- phone call from Mrs. Jean Berry, who graciously has consented to have her name used here. Mrs. Berry called to report a most remarkable sighting of a cigar-shaped object hovering over her property. When she first spotted the object it appeared to her to be nothing more than an intensely bright white light, with a very faint yellow tinge to it. At first, she was merely intrigued by its bizarre appearance, and she walked out on the second-story porch to observe the ob- ject more closely with binoculars. Initially, she esti- mated the disiance of the object from her house at less than 1/4 mile: when she later paced off the distance to where she thought the object had been hovering, the dis- tance was approximately l/8th mile, roughly twice the length of a football field. Mrs. Berry's first full view of the object was from its right side. She reported that it appeared to have \"win- dows\" along its side, and it seemed to her that it was somehow \"surveying,\" her land. She further noted that \"there was no motor sound,\" but that it did give off a faint hum, she thought. AUGUST 1996 NUMBER 340 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL After a short period of time, the object appeared to turn toward her and begin to approach her house, which alarmed her, and caused her to re-enter the house. At this point she was better able to estimate the size of the craft, which she described as \"bigger than a blimp.\" After what Mrs. Berry estimated to be approximately five minutes of hovering and slow drifting over her land, the object began to move to the southwest, and be- gan to rise in the evening sky. Shortly after it began to move it quickly disappeared from sight. The observer telephoned her neighbor on the evening of the sighting to inquire whether he had seen anything. He reported only that he had been witness to a peculiar bright light, and that when he was driving home earlier in the evening, he had seen a strange shaft of light sweep across the readjust ahead of his vehicle! A point of interest in this case is that approximately 15 years earlier, Mrs. Berry had been witness to an- other sighting in that area of Missouri. She witnessed a black sphere, which appeared to have \"tentacles\" ex- tending out from it. At one point during this earlier sighting she pursued the object in her car, attempting to get a closer look at it. She prepared a water color paint- ing of the object for Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was in- volved in the investigation of the sighting report. — Peter Davenport UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO Newsclipping Service will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounters and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town and foreign newspapers.

All State Directors were advised by a letter nearly a year ago to utilize this number for filing hot UFO cases that came to their attention. The majority of our calls, to-date, have been from people who called the 800 directory and asked for \"UFO\" to report sightings or to seek UFO information.^ To send letters to every police department and sher- iff's office throughout the U.S.A. would obviously be both expensive and time-consuming. We would like for every State Director, State Section Director, Field Investigator, and Field Investigator Trainee to notify your local sheriff, police chief, and state highway patrol office of MUFON's 800 number via a postcard that they may post on their bulletin boards or at the dis- patcher's desk. Presently, we are attempting to answer all calls \"live.\" An answering box records the calls received late at night and early mornings. These sighting reports will be mailed or telephoned to the nearest State Section Director, State Director, or Field Investigator for a per- sonal interview. Brief replies to these cases under in- vestigation may be made to MUFON on the 800 num- ber. (The answering box is limited to three minutes.) However, this number is not to be used for other MU- FON communications. The MUFON business office number is (210) 379-9216. Please advise Walt Andrus by postcard or letter to which agencies you filed the UFO hotline number 1-800-UFO-2166.

The prime assertion of scientist/researcher Stanton T. Friedman, author of TOP SECRET/MAJIC, Marlowe & Co., is that on September 24, 1947, President Harry S. Truman created Operation Majestic Twelve, a covert group answerable only to the Office of the President. MJ-12's ostensible functions were to contain the evi- dence regarding the 1947 crash/retrieval in New Mexico of an extraterrestrial vehicle and its alien occupants, analyze and exploit it. The critical evidence is the MJ-12 documents themselves. If the documents are authentic, their contents prove the extraordinary claim that ex- traterrestrials have come to planet Earth. It should also be respected, as the law recognizes, that although the best evidence of a thing is the thing itself (in this case, the debris and bodies), documentary and testimonial evidence is acceptable if the best evidence is unavail- able. It is therefore disingenuous for critics to disdain documents and testimony when agencies of the gov- ernment deny the event ever occurred, after they threat- ened witnesses and stole away the corpus. However, before delving into the evidence, it is ab- solutely necessary to state how the evidence of docu- ment authenticity is to be weighed. Unless there are es- tablished ground rules, it becomes a shouting match between \"it is so, it is not.\" Forensic authority for doc- ument verification provides that the burden of proving authenticity lies not with the proponent but the skeptic to establish fraudulence. The proponent's job is to join is- sue, refuting the material and relevant claims. Friedman takes on those he calls noisy negativists with gusto and irrefutable evidence. He shows their use of selective data, lack of or faulty research, and out-and-out lies. To Friedman's credit as a fair advocate, he challenges the certitude of his own claims. But here he's too hard on himself because proof is established when claims of fraudulence are set aside. Friedman has heroically done that job. The book has a foreword by Whitley Strieber and an introduction by the author. Strieber's foreword is very telling, given his recent distancing of himself from all ufologists and his own researched verification of the underlying MJ-12 data. He calls \"...this terribly provoca- tive book ... the history of an appalling secret that is probably the central reality of our times, but also of the life of a man who has been fighting to reveal that secret ...\" Friedman's introduction traces that life, academic, professional, ufological, and personal, including such warts-and-all disclosure that the stress of full-time lec- turing and family illnesses led to a difficult marital sep- aration. Now the reader can better appreciate Friedman's honesty when he offers \"... with this book, the data is on the table. Make up your mind.\" As a cautionary note, Friedman argues that the MJ-12 documents may not be taken outside of the context that, as he always says, some, underlining the word \"some,\" some UFOs are somebody else's spaceships. The clincher for this position came early in his research when he happened upon the privately published U.S.A.F. Project Blue Book Special Report 14, that scientifically reviewed over 3,000 sightings, finding that 21% were \"unknowns\" and the chance they were just missed \"knowns\" was less than 1%. This cautionary note is of no small moment. Recently the TV science series \"Nova\" broadcast an alien abduction program. It sum- marily dismissed the whole of the UFO phenomena as a product of post-war jitters. By so doing, untutored view- ers could accept \"Nova's\" conclusion that it was all psychological.

For those needing to get up to speed on the UFO subject, Friedman references eight pages of sources, which include ten Ph.D. theses. Friedman has paid a price for his heroic efforts. When researcher Robert Todd found himself under the FBI's intimidation for not revealing the name of an unnamed informant who disclosed that in 1967 a UFO destroyed a pursuing Cuban MIG-21 jet, it was Friedman alone who knew the informant's identity. As he says, this caused him several sleepless nights listening for knock- ing at his door. And who wouldn't think twice about his research and advocacy when discovering a \"... telex from OSI headquarters at Boiling Air Force Base to their more than 120 units around the world: 1. We have reason to believe ... field units may re- ceive a request... regarding UFO sightings .... The re- quest may originate with Stanton T. Friedman. If such is received, do not repeat do not refer the request to this HQS as required by A.F. Regulation 12-30 AFOSI Sup.l.\" H eroic aptly describes the tediousness of over a decade's worth of research at 15 archives. (At one point Friedman uses levity to compare his pursuit to the joke in the last scene of the film \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" where the secret is filed in plain view in a nearly infinite number of identical boxes stacked on high in a cavernous warehouse). Now, down to cases. Philip Klass, professional cynic and media darling, challenged the September 24, 1947, Truman-Forrestal memo (here Truman creates Operation Majestic Twelve), claiming he found an identical Truman signature on a verified memo to Bush on October 1, 1947. Klass claims, therefore, one must be a forgery because two signatures are never identical. Klass was wrong on the facts and the premise. Holding the two up to a light reveals the signatures come close, but \"no cigar.\" As to the premise, the very authority he selec- tively quotes goes on in the same publication to state \"... in some cases ... identical signatures can be found.\" As critics of Klass like to say, Klass dismissed. Kevin Randle, in his second Roswell book, has an ap- pendix entitled \"The Majestic 12 Hoax.\" Here he relies on the claim of Joseph Nickell, a CSICOP fellow, that \"the date format for the briefing documents was wrong because it violated the government's style manual.\" Anybody who spends extensive time in archives with holdings of pre-1960 declassified material will note that the style manual is ignored in very limited distribution, highly classified memos. And the most influential of all debunkers, Carl Sagan, in his latest book. The Demon-Haunted World, takes on the MJ-12 documents. He relies on things Klass says and blithely accepts the Air Force's claim of bogus, ab- sent any supportive findings of fact whatsoever. Sounds like science by proclamation, Dr. Sagan! The book also provides two new MJ-12 documents. One is a very brief, cryptic memo from General George C. Marshal] to President Truman dated 25 Sept. '47; RefMAJIC; EO 092447: MJ-12 Rpt. reflecting Marshall's belief that Twining's report be kept from the public. This memo was provided by researcher Tim Cooper and appears authentic. The other MJ-12 document was mailed to Don Berliner, Friedman's co-author of Crash at Corona. It ar- rived in 1994 from an anonymous source in the form of undeveloped 35mm film. Development revealed a com- prehensive, 22-page Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual dated April 1954, which sets out with bureaucratic exactitude how to handle Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, recovery and disposal. For instance, under \"Uncrating, Unpacking and Checking,\" it requires \"(3) Remove screws from the top of the shipping container with a screw driver.\" Research here is ongoing. It should be noted that Friedman runs down many proffered documents and leads only to find them bogus or not amenable to sub- stantiation. In the end, it appears that Friedman is a driven man. He's driven to help make this world a better place for his and other children. He's driven by the wide-eyed inno- cence of a child's imagination that this can be done. He's driven by a belief born of the seasoning of a 62- year-old mainstream scientist that ETs are here and hu- mans' proper place must be in the galactic community. He hopes we can enter what he calls \"the cosmic kinder- garten.\" To those ends he hopes that \"... international conferences should be convened, perhaps through the United Nations, to evaluate the religious, economic, military, political and philosophical implications of our situation with regard to extraterrestrial visitors.\" I believe Friedman has made out this case.

In his recently published book titled Dark Eagles. \"A History of Top Secret US Aircraft Programs.\" author Curtis Peebles described a secret Northrop aircraft with the unusual nickname \"Shamu.\" This label originated from rival Lockheed engineers because, to them, it re- sembled the killer whale at Sea World. Other descrip- tions of the elusive stealth aircraft included resembling a flying wing and an old Boeing Stratocrusier airliner of the 1950s. When I compared Peebles' description of Shamu with the Journal's cover photo, and a photo published recently in the Houston Chronicle. I felt that 1 had uncovered Tacit Blue's other name. To confirm my hunch I contacted Mr. Peebles through his publisher. During our phone conversation he con- curred with me, saying that Shamu and Tacit Blue were the same. He also said that this aircraft was designed for surveillance of enemy armored units in a battle front combat environment. Peebles commented that the engine's exhaust outlet uses a \"platypus tail\" trailing edge exhaust deflector. [ suspect that some of the air entering the flush top inlet quite possibly bypasses the two turbofan jet engines and mixes with the hot exhaust before passing over the deflector. The result would be a cool exhaust stream and low infrared (IR) thermal signature as a defense against IR seeking missiles. Curtis Peebles also sent me copies of two excellent articles that appeared in the May 6, 1996 issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology. Both articles cov- ered separate but related details of Tacit Blue's design and development and the Air Force's tactical use of the aircraft. Tacit Blue's unusual shape was the result of a tactical radar requirement and the need to have a low radar cross section (RCS) from the side. This design also tested the RCS of a curvilinear surface (curved) rather than a faceted (smooth and flat) approach as used on the F-117. According to the Aviation Week articles, \"Air Force officials won't say where the aircraft was tested or stored, but it was likely at the Groom Lake airfield north of Las Vegas.\" The aircraft's main function, electronic surveillance, was achieved using a large Hughes-built side-looking \"phase steering\" radar. The radar unit was placed inside the fuselage so that it could observe out of either side of the aircraft through large panels behind the cockpit. A phased array radar antenna is fixed mechanically (not movable) and uses electronics to point and steer its radar beam. Both articles also discussed the unique flight charac- teristics of the aircraft. Described as resembling \"a streamlined loaf of bread,\" the aircraft was \"unstable in both pitch and yaw.\" This handling problem earned it the nickname of \"HUM,\" for Highly Unstable Mother, by its pilots. To correct this handling problem a General Electric digital, quadruple redundant, fly-by-wire flight control system was used. This resulted in unimpressive perfor- mance but reportedly \"no scary flights.\" \"Tacit Blue flew at 250 kt. and approached (to land) at around 120 kt.\" According to Air Force data on the Web, some of the current B-2 bomber's stealth technology and a once classified \"stand-off strategic missile, were tested on this aircraft. Evaluated were the combinations of curved and linear surfaces and special composite surface mate- rials which absorb tracking radar signals. Described by the Air Force as resembling an upside-down bathtub with stubby wings, it is physically close to an F-15 in size. It carried no weapons. Reportedly, Tacit Blue cost $136 million to build and another $29 million to test. Between February 1982 and February 1985, five pilots flew the craft 135 times, in daylight, for a total of 250 hours. The Air Force can- celed the Tacit Blue project in 1985 and replaced it with the Joint-Stars modified Boeing 707 (non-stealth), which is still in the test and evaluation phase. The 707 carries a bigger radar, provides wider ground coverage, and can remain further from hostile air defenses and the battle front. To gain further technical information on Tacit Blue, I contacted the Research Division of Wright-Patterson's Air Force Museum in Dayton Ohio where the aircraft is now on display. I received several Air Force Public Affairs fact sheets and a \"News Release\" on the aircraft. These documents provided very little new information. Like the F-15, Tacit Blue carries a crew of one and weighs about the same at 30,000 Ibs. However, like the B-2, its speed is sub-sonic. Wright-Patterson researchers informed me that they have not entered the craft and that it is still sealed and classified. Before arriving at the mu- seum the plane was re-painted, the ejection seat and canopy de-armed and all fuel, oils, and lubricants purged. Additional information on Tacit Blue was requested from the Secretary of the Air Force Office of Public Affairs in Washington DC. The documents received were identical to those from Wright-Patterson re- searchers. Should one of our Journal readers visit Wright- Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and view Tacit Blue, I would appreciate hearing about your visit. Please contact me by E-mail at \"Beatwell@aol.com.\" My thanks to Curtis Peebles for technical input and editing, and Rebecca Schatte and Michael Lindemann of ISCNI for supplying Tacit Blue Web data. — Bill Eatwell AUGUST 1996 NUMBER 340 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL F ORU/V Letters to Mufon UFO Journal SCIENTIFIC UFOLOGY I wish to congratulate Dr. Bernhard Haisch for what I think is the most important and intelligent article I have read in the Journal in my many years of mem- bership, dating back to CUFOS (\"UFO's and Mainstream Science,\" No. 335, March, 1996). I have long held parallel opinions and his article has motivat- ed me to express some of these to you and to the MUFON membership at large. Perhaps some support and even action can be generated. As important as lay volunteer research and investi- gation has been and is to ufology, I doubt that the ulti- mate answer to the UFO enigma will be achieved by the mere gathering and computerizing of data in this way. Nor do I think that debriefing or hypnotizing abductees and recording their stories will lead us on the path of fi- nal truth. I strongly agree with Dr. Haisch that what is needed is a well thought out, logical, objective and realistic re- search protocol developed and carried out by highly qualified mainstream physical and social scientists who are dedicated to seeking and finding the truth. If MUFON is to be the organizer of this project — and if not MUFON who? — we must enhance the image of our organization, our Journal and ufology in general in the eyes of the type of scientists we are trying to at- tract. The following are some suggestions toward this end: 1) We must completely divorce ourselves from any association with aspects of parapsychology such as \"out of body\" or \"near death\" experiences. We must likewise totally separate our science from any reference to the various folklore populations such as Big Foot, the Loch Ness monster, fairies, leprechauns and so forth. These subjects should not be part of any articles or advertise- ments accepted by our Journal, nor should we take part in any meetings or symposia in which they are included. 2) For the most part, articles in the Journal should be based on research, investigation and data. Articles based on opinion should be footnoted and referenced so that the basis for the opinion can be determined. • 3) Articles that include or encourage personal de- bate, attacks on personalities or backbiting should be eliminated. Non-personal, objective debate should take place only in the Forum section. In closing. I would like to suggest that MUFON's di- rector or Board of Trustees appoint an Ad' Hoc Committee whose charge it would be to enroll a panel of respected scientists to develop the research protocol mentioned above and ideas for its funding. A good place to start seeking membership for this committee is MUFON's Research Consultants. Perhaps by using and networking through these people, prestigious scientists at various companies and universities can be contacted. My goal is significant elevation of the scientific pres- tige of ufology. MUFON is the only organization that can achieve that and the time to start is now. —Saul H. Goldstein, DOS New Jersey HIGH STRANGENESS Re my friend Jerry Clark's letter (MUFON UFO Journal, July 1996) concerning certain criticisms which I raised in my review of his High Strangeness, volume 3 of The UFO Encyclopedia (Journal, June 1996): As I have pointed out to Clark privately, and as I believe I made clear in my review, my observation that he gave short shrift to the views and findings of Stanton Friedman, Jacques Vallee, Philip Klass, and Robert Shaefter was with respect specifically to his accounts in High Strangeness of the Delphos, Kansas, and Coyne CE2s — not in general. Even with its shortcomings—which are remarkably few, indeed, given the magnitude of the undertaking— The UFO Encyclopedia is a \"must have\" for all serious students of the UFO phenomenon, not to mention library reference collections in need of such source volumes. —Karl T.

Its extreme southern declination places the planet in its worst viewing position since 1985. Jupiter begins the night in the S at dusk and then sets in the WSW about midnight. It remains within 1° of the globular star cluster M22. Saturn, in Pisces, reaches opposition to the Sun on September 26 at magnitude 0.5. The planet is only 3° below the totally eclipsed Moon that night. Because the ringed world lies nearly opposite the Sun during the month, it rises in the E about sunset and remains in view all night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-4.1) and Mars (1.5).rise in the NE about 2:45 and 2 AM, respectively. The brighter object lies 3° below the fainter on the 4th. Both planets are joined by the lunar crescent on the 8th and 9th.Saturn sets in the W about sunrise. Total Lunar Eclipse: The total eclipse of September 26-27 is a more favorable one for North America than the April event. Observers in the western third of the U.S.. however, will miss the early partial phases which begin before moonrise there. The Harvest Moon enters the dark central shadow of the Earth at 9:12 PM (EOT) and becomes totally hidden at 10:19. After 70 minutes of to- tality, our satellite emerges at 11:29 and is fully restored at 12:36 AM.

Michigan on July 11, 12 and 13, 1997, hosted by Michigan MU- FON. Michael Curta and Colorado MUFON will host the 1998 symposium in Denver, Colorado, the mile high city. Susan and Rob Swiatek and the Northern Virginia MUFON organization will host the 1999 sym- posium in the Arlington-Alexandria, Virginia locale. Bruce A.

Kelley and Henry Owens plan to have Georgia MUFON host the sympo- sium in Atlanta, Georgia for the year 2002. This leaves an opening in 2001 for the Western Region. UFO AWARENESS WEEK This is a last minute reminder that the Annual National UFO Awareness Week will be conducted from August 10 through 18, 1996. This is a major project in MU- FON's public education program. Director of Public Education, Linda C. Murphy and her husband Bill were videotaping interviews with MUFON leaders at Greensboro, NC in preparation for the production of a MUFON introductory video program to be used at future UFO Awareness Weeks. Linda submitted a list of pro- posals for improved public communications to Walt Andrus to enhance MUFON's public exposure. DAVID WEBB RESIGNS AS EASTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR David F. Webb was elected Eastern Regional Director on February I, 1994. On June 24, 1996, he asked to be relieved of this responsibility, since his job required a large amount of traveling and he was unable to process the UFO reports from the eastern region in a timely manner, creating a proverbial bottleneck. The Board of Directors understood the situation and reluctantly ac- cepted Mr. Webb's resignation. As David pointed out, the job responsibilities of the position are far more time- consuming than they were 20 years ago when he served in the same post. Until such time as a replacement is secured, all east- ern region State Directors should send their processed UFO sighting reports directly to the Deputy Director of Investigation, T. David Spencer, 6700 Woodcrest, Austin, TX 78759. MUFON is now seeking candidates to fill the unex- pired two-year term of Mr. Webb. Obviously, the inter- ested individuals must live in the eastern region of states to qualify. This is an opportunity for a State Director, Assistant State Director or State Section Director to as- sume greater responsibilities on the MUFON Board of Directors, since this is an elective office. People inter- ested should send a short letter to Walt Andrus enu- merating their education and experience to fill this im- portant post until the regular election in 1998. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAMS Anyone who has purchased and studied the 4th edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eligible to take the exam via mail when they feel they are ready. The 100-question test may be secured from MUFON headquarters in Seguin and returned to this office for grading. In localities where field investigator training classes are being conducted, the instructor may order sufficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the completion of the training classes. For current members, the new manual may be purchased for $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling from MUFON in Seguin.
