Witness: Mrs. R. H. (name known to SKYLOOK), age 48, divorced. Three male children: one married, one in college, and third child, age 13, residing with mother/Good health, normal vision, wears reading glasses. Occupation: occasional babysitter. Notable personal characteristics: neatness of personal appearance, tidi- ness of mobile home. Time of Incident: Pre-dawn, ap- proximately 2:30 a.m., Sunday, Oct. 12,1973. Weather: Clear skies, no mist nor fog, chilly. Background of Investigation The incident became known to this writer circuitously through Ted Bloecher of New York, who is doing research on UFO humanoid cases On Oct. 24, 1974, I reached the wit- ness by phone. She was willing to dis- cuss her close encounter with the UFO,-during which time I took co- pious notes. I was impressed by her sincerity in relating the bizarre de- tails describing the UFO, the occu- pant, the EM effects and the various collectable residuals, which she thought might relate to the case. The Encounter Mrs. R. H. relates that she awoke sometime around 2:30 a.m. because of intense thirst, and on arising from her bed was attracted to a bright light coming through the drawn curtains. She pulled the curtain apart and was startled, initially, by a row of indi- vidual lights forming an arc about two yards from her window. Each light source was as large as a \"hand with the fingers spread out.\" The lights, \"maybe six\" she recalled, were about 4 feet off the ground and alternately vividly blue and silver \"like stars as beautiful as Christmas lights,\" each \"lit up inside\" (self lumi- nous), casting no radiance to the ground or onto a nearby storage shed. Close up ol the self-luirnnous , transparent capsule with featureless occupant, the bottom portion of ' which was obscured by a parked car as witnessed by Mrs Heitfeld Rough sketch by L H Strlnqdeld. The lights were in a fixed position and did not pulsate. She did not open the window. No sound was audible, nor odor.  . . While the \"Christmas lights\" still attracted her attention, the witness said her eyes were drawn next to a strong bright light further out in the asphalt parking court beyond her trailer. A car was parked on the blacktop about 10 feet from the trailer, which partly obscured the bottom portion of the light source in which an \"ape-like creature\" ap- peared. Terrified, she watched this area of light for about two or three minutes and thought the creature appeared to the rear of the parked car \"maybe do- ing something to the car.\" (It was at this time she ran to her son's bedroom and tried to awaken him. She yelled, \"My God, Carl, get up ... get up and look at that thing out there!\") When she returned to the window, Mrs. R. H. relates, \"The creature apr peared to be further away from the car, maybe 35 feet away.\" This time it was inside a \"shield of light,\" the light \"looking like a light in an operating room.\" The shield was shaped like a lady's umbrella, \"the kind that comes down over the head\" (often referred to as a bubble umbrella). The bright light was within the shield. There was no glow of light beyond the shield. The creature \"stood, out clearly,\" looking like \"an ape\" with a big waist and no neck. There were no distin- guishable features in the head, but Mrs. R. H.'s description indicated it was a side view of a head of prog- nathic configuration with a snout, which tapered downward. The head and body were facing the Swallen's warehouse building, which was to the left of the witness' mobile home. The body was entirely gray and was also featureless. Only the arms on each side of the big waist were moving \"very slowly,\" alternately up and down. Mrs. R. H. showed me the up and down motion without bending elbows, Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"General perspective view of trailer coun showing approximated distances of Mrs. Heltfeld's trailer, the adjacent storage shed the parked car and the warehouse In relationship to the self- luminous, transparent bell-jar capsule with occupant. Rough sketch by L. H. Strlngfield. which appeared to be the character- istic stiffness of a robot. No other part of the body moved. At one point, Mrs. R. H., in trying to describe the object's shape, held up a bell jar. \"It was like glass,\" she said, \"a , glass shield that had a bright light inside it. It was round on top.\" The object's circumference was estimated to be equal to \"six men each holding hands with their arms outstretched, standing in a circle.\" She added, \"there was plenty of room inside the lighted dome to hold sev- eral more creatures of similar size. By Mrs. R. H.'s estimate, the object or shield was approximately 15 feet in diameter. There were no visible instruments or panels inside the self- luminous capsule, although the occu- pant's arms appeared to be moving a lever that was not visible. Mrs. R. H. relates that the humanoid remained in view about four or five minutes Page 4 during the whole episode. The Son's Reaction The son, Carl, was urged by Mrs. R. H. to \"get up\" from a deep sleep. He arose, and still half asleep, looked out- side initially toward the Swallen's warehouse building, which had a fa- miliar small lamp under the edge of the roof. \"Not there,\" pleaded Mrs. R. H. \"Look over there,\" and she pointed to the shield and creature. When Carl answered \"Yeah!,\" Mrs. R. H. then relates she ran (with Carl still dazed) to the next room to the telephone. She did not turn on the lights, dialed the operator, and asked for the police department. The response by the Price Hill Po- lice Department was blunt: \"Lady, we've already been there.\" (The of- ficer was indicating a fire alarm.) Despite Mrs. R. H.'s plea she could not convince the officer of the legiti- macy of her story. She described the UFO and its occupant and said, \"It's still here ... it can't be human!\" Some time later, while the witness was still on the phone, Carl recalls looking out the window and saw that the parked car was apparently having engine trouble as a second car had joined it and was \"jumping\" the bat- tery. Carl went back to bed. Mo- ments later, with Mrs. R. H. still on the phone, there was a very \"loud, deep BOOM sound.\" \"What was that?\" Mrs. R. H. asked her son. Carl, in bed, replied, \"It must be the car starting.\" Not knowing about the car problem, Mrs. R. H. told the police \"wait a minute,\" and returned to the window. The UFO and its occupant had dis- appeared. Also, the parked car and the second car that Carl had seen were gone. Mrs. R. H. returned to the phone and informed the police angrily, \"Never mind, it's gone!\" She hung up. She could not go back to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"sleep, and kept the lights on the rest of the night. Carl, however, testifies that he saw the bright light his mother had indi- cated beyond the parked car which occurred before the second car had arrived. At some unknown point during this long interval, the UFO and occupant had departed from the scene as neither Mrs. R. H. (on phone) or Carl (in bed) were watching. The UFO's departure may have been triggered by the sudden appearance of the two teenagers in the second car. The parked car (owner, a young man — unknown) had its battery jumped by a second car (his girl friend's). They had just returned to the parking area and neither the couple nor the second car were in view during the time Mrs. R. H. had looked out the window. The girl told Mrs. R. H. the next day that they saw no light in the parking lot when they arrived and had used no light them- selves while jumping the battery. The girl also said that her boyfriend's car \"always had some kind of trouble.\" There is no way of knowing if the troubled car was an EM effect, or, if the loud boom was caused by the UFO or the car's exhaust. Artifacts and Residuals Found in Area The following day, Mrs. R. H. searched the asphalt-covered parking area behind her trailer for evidence of the \"terrifying creature.\" Near her trailer (beyond about 6 feet of grass) on the asphalt she found a conspicu- ous swirl of ashes, small chunks and powder. The ashes appeared to have been churned by a strong wind or fan. She tried to pick up chunks which crumbled easily. She did manage to get several V4 inch-size units and some dust which she deposited in a plastic bag. This substance was in evidence near the row of blue and sil- ver lights. Mrs. R. H. also discovered broken fragments of floor tile, manufactured by Armstrong, in the same area, which appeared to have been scat- tered or flung outward over the same area as the ashes. Some were flung to the base of her mobile home. She did not recall seeing these fragments in the area before the incident. The fragments were heavily scuffed. The main witness, Mrs. R. H., stands at the rear of her trailer. The level of her outstretched arm is the esti- mated elevation of the blue and silver lights. In further search she discovered a \"plastic disc\" depressed into the as- phalt, which she admitted may not be related to the incident. However, she - was impressed by the plastic disc and dug it out of the asphalt with a screw- driver. She then noted that the disc revealed \"symbols or foreign letters\" which she could not recognize. This object she also put into a plastic bag. When my wife and I investigated the case, I suspected that the blue disc had a man-made explanation/and that the characters were oriental (later found to be Japanese). I also recognized the Armstrong tile (so marked), but could not account for its fragmentation. The powdered sub- stance remains unexplained, and may warrant laboratory analysis. Mrs. R. H. does not necessarily relate any of the residual exhibits to the colored lights or the UFO (shield and crea- ture), but in her frantic search for evidence she gathered all suspect items. EM Effect Investigation \"The creature was facing the Swal- len's warehouse,\" said Mrs. R. H. Co- incidently, and perhaps unrelated, is the fact that the Swallen's single story warehouse, approximately 125- 150 feet from the UFO, had its fire alarm tripped by an unknown cause. I checked the Cincinnati Fire Depart- ment (Records Department) and found that District 3 Fire Tower on Glenway Avenue (four miles away) had responded to this alram with four vehicles (Engines No. 21, 24, 35 and Ladder Truck No. 10) under the di- rection of Fire Marshall Robert Mil- ler in response to an alarm sounded at 2:27 a.m. The time coincides with Mrs. R. H.'s related incident. Mrs. R. H. relates she was unaware of the fire department's response until the next day, when a neighbor in- formed her of the Swallen's fire alarm and fire department activity. She did not see the fire engines or the firemen. Fire Marshall Miller re- lates that the vehicles did not enter the trailer court area (entrance on Glenway Avenue). They entered at 3225 Brader Avenue, an area which would have been obscured from Mrs. R. H.'s vision by the Swallen ware- house building. The Fire Department records re- veal the following: \"Compression Switch turned off. Sprinkler System lost air. Cause unknown. No fire. Re- ceived alarm at 2:27 a.m.\" Fire Mar- shall Miller reported back to District 3 that his vehicles were \"back in service\" (case closed, vehicles avail- able for service) at 2:41 a.m. Mar- shall Miller remembers the event with this comment: \"Something caused the electrical surge to trip the alarm. Could not find the cause.\" I inquired of Marshall Miller if he had a vehicle using blue lights or men wearing asbestos suits, which I thought might account for Mrs. R. H.'s experience. His reply was that all fire vehicles use only red lights, and no personnel had reason to don asbes- tos suits. This is only done in the event of fire. The owner of the Swallen Stores (a large chain in Cincinnati), Mr. Don Swallen, was informed of the alarm and arrived on the scene. Mrs. R. H. talked to him the next day about the alarm and her UFO incident, which he recalled when I checked with him -on the details of the alarm. Swallen verified the fire alarm being tripped, which had no explanation. He also stated that there was no sign of forced entry of his premises. The alarm that was tripped was Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"self-installed by Swallen Stores. Other Swallen buildings, such as the retail store adjacent to the warehouse are equipped by American Alarm Com- pany, which according to that com- pany's records, do not show their alarm reacting during the same time frame. On Dec. 30, 1974, Mrs. Heitfeld man- aged to located the teenagers; the owner of the parked car named Cliff Fulmer, and Tina Marie Arrico, who at that time lived with her mother in the trailer court, and whose car pro- vided the battery jump. I phoned Tina, who related that she and her friend had returned from a drive-in theatre to the Swallen's lot shortly after 2:30 a.m. . . . \"no later than 3 a.m.\" She stated that Cliff's car was notorious for its troubles, es- pecially getting it started. She said on this occasion the battery went dead, and they used her car to jump the battery. She said, it caused a brief spark and a loud boom. Tina said that a police car arrived a few minutes after their arrival, cruised around the lot, and departed immediately. Tina said neither she nor Cliff observed anything unusual during her brief time in the parking lot. She did not see or hear the Fire Department activity at Swallen's warehouse. Mrs. Heitfeld states she did not see the second car arrive on the lot or see the battery jumping operation. Tina said that the next morning after she heard of Mrs. Heitfeld's ex- perience, she joined in the search for evidence in the parking lot. She con- firmed the deposit of cinders and powder substance near the trailer and the fragments of linoleum which were not there before. Tina's reference to a police car checking the lot indicates the possi- bility that the police did respond to Mrs. Heitfeld's phone plea for help. I asked Mrs. R. H. if she had been interested in UFOs, or had recently discussed the subject. She replied that she never had any particular in- terest in UFOs. However, she said that she was aware of the fact that the subject was in the news in recent weeks. She also related that she had sometime earlier remarked to a rela- tive, \"I don't believe in that kind of This is a portion of the small chunks of powder found near the witness' trailer. stuff.\" She added, \"If I ever saw one I'd walk right up to it.\" She took exception to her avowed bravery during her own encounter. She states that she was petrified, so frightened that she didn't know what to do. She did not turn on her lights, fearing the \"creature\" would come into her trailer. She dialed the oper- ator in the dark to have the operator call the police. She tried desperately to awaken a deep-sleeping son. She would not open the window or go out- side until the next morning. She was upset that the police did not respond. When I began investigating the case, Oct. 24, 1974, Mrs. R. H. remarked that it was like living the whole thing all over again and she felt fearful. Her son, Carl, was sincere and co- operative. He surmised during my initial interview that the blue disc was a part of a firework, but was un- certain of the light source outside the trailer. He admitted he got up in a daze, half-asleep. Mrs. R. H. comments that \"nobody believes me about the creature or the shield.\" She assures me that she was not dreaming, as the whole thing was in view for several minutes. Conclusion I believe that Mrs. R. H. had a real conscious experience and was witness to unusual anomalies beyond her ability to understand. The incident was not a hoax. Her choice of descrip- tive phraseology to compare the un- conventional to familiar objects lends credence to her endeavor to relate the truth. The EM effects are in the time frame of her observation as con- firmed by the Fire Department, and the powdered substance is in my pos- session and available for analysis.

Since Eden's letterhead carries the legend \"All operations registered with U.S. Department of Commerce National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),\" implying some official connection with that agency, a follow-up investigation was made. Eden's letter to the author, dated Oct. 4, 1974, made two further asser- tions: that he had \"successfully\" used a Reich \"Cloudbuster\" for weather modification in the northwest, and that he is \"duly registered with NOAA as a Reich Cloudbuster oper- ator.\" Eden further cited an NOAA docu- ment, \"Weather Modification Activity Reports, Nov. 1, 1972, to Dec. 31, 1973,\" with specific page references, as if in support of his claims. The salient features of NOAA's reply to the author, dated Nov. 13,1974, should be of interest to Skylook readers. (1) Eden is registered with NOAA; if he weren't, his attempts to modify weather would be in violation of Pub- lic Law 92-205. Anyone attempting weather modification must be so registered. There is no other signifi- cance to that statement by Eden. (2) Asked whether NOAA recognized the \"Reich Cloudbuster\" as a legiti- mate scientific interest, NOAA re- plied: \"... no scientific research or controlled experiments have been re- ported that substantiate any mea- surable results obtained through us- ing this apparatus.\" (3) A copy of the report cited by Eden was obtained; it, too, merely indicates that Eden has complied with the law by registering his ac- tivities and in no way substantiates any claims of success.

Hochries (1569 m), with its alpine hut, is a prominent mountain peak of the Northern Calcareous Alps at the Aust- rian-Bavarian border 70 kms SE of Munich, capital of Bavaria, 15 kms SE of Rosenheim, and a- bout the same distance SW of famous Lake Chiemsee, Western Germany. Mt. Hochries, Mt» Geigelstein (1808 m) and Mt. Kampenwand (1669 m) are' the last alpine summits of Chiemgau'er Mountains overlooking the colorful plane of Bavarian Alpenvorland (pre- alpine country) with sweeping vistas over the Rosenheim, and Chiemsee region, as well as over the Lower and. High Aust- rian Alps to the south. On a clear day you can see the snow- covered peaks of Stubaier and Zillertaler Alps at Northern Tyrol. The beautiful surroundings have made the Hochries region a popular skiing ground, and a cable-car has been constructed to take skiers from Crainbach up to Hochries hut. An interrupted supper Dec. 10, 1973, was one of those typical Bavarian winter evenings with a full moon over the snowy slopes. Mr Friedrich Lennartz, 33, landlord of Hoch- ries hut and mountain rescue service man, had his supper to- gether with Hochries porter Peter Zettel, 29. .The two men were sitting at a table in the dining room, so Zettel looked right through the large pano- ramic window into the dark southeast towards Mt. Geigel- stein, which is 8 kms distant. Suddenly, at approximately 8:30 p.m. GET, Zettel noticed a fiery spot at Mt Weitlahnerkopf (1611 m), somewhat to the north of Mt. Geigelstein, and showed This case was investigated by Dipl. Ing. Adolf Schneider, Ernst Berger, and the investigators of the Central European Section of MUFON. it to Lennartz. \"Really some- thing big and easy to spot, bigger than a fire. First we thought of mountaineers in danger signalling with mag- nesium torches or a burning hut because of the brilliance,\" Lennartz later told us. \"The ground was illuminated all a- round it.\" It was a quiet night with ex- cellent visibility, no clouds, and only a slight southern breeze. Lennartz and Zettel got their Zeiss Ikon binocu- lars, 10x50 and 12x50, opened the window, and pointed their instruments at the \"burning spot\" in the snow. They were amazed to see a mysterious fiery object, which had appar- ently touched down near the cross -of Mt. Weitlahnerkopf summit and was now resting motionless in or above a shal- low trough. . . Had there been an aircrash? The landing area is almost 8 kms away from a ground projec- tion of Upper Blue 1 airway with its heading of 137°/317° J i.e. running from azimuth 137° over Reit im Winkel and Lake Chiemsee to airport Munich- Riem. Or was it a wrecked heli- copter of Bavaria's air rescue? The general reaction of Len- nartz and Zettel followed the \"escalation of hypotheses\" pat- tern, according to Dr. Allen Hynek. At closer examination it was a strange sight even to Len- nartz, .who had been a member of the German navy at a special marine division for air con- trol, and later at tactical close defence reconnaissance from 1950 to 1962. Egg-shaped object The object seemed to be egg- shaped, pointed end up, and stood upright in the snow (see sketch). The nearby cross of Weitlahnerkopf was a good com- parison, and Lennartz esti- mated the object's size at 9 by 12 (or 14) meters. Its upper third looked like a yellowish dome, and rotating colored lights sped around its lower body and the outer circumfer- ence . Both men kept their \"air- crash opinion\" and went into action. The landlord signalled with his powerful US flash- light, and they switched on and off all lights in Hochries hut, but no reaction was discernible at Weitlahnerkopf. At 8:40 p.m. Lennartz went to the mike of his Soramerkamp TS 600 wireless set to transmit an emergency exercise call. We have to add that Lennartz is no simple ham operator or hobby- ist, but uses his TS 600 pro- fessionally for alpine rescue purposes and has built a 15 meter antenna east of his hut which gives his set an average broadcasting range of 300 kms. His code name \"Romeo Golf I\" is well-known among 11 meter band operators in southern Bavaria,, 11 meter band conversations usually take place between 27 215 and 27 275 megacycles.The Hochries wireless set is con- nected to the grid, not to a battery, and has an . output of 2.8 watts. Signal attracts object Lennartz reached \"UTO II,\" Hoslwang,\" MQskar Echo,\" and other stations in the Munich- Rosenheim area. At 8:50 p.m. he decided to fire a red signal rocket into the object's direc- tion, which he did. The rocket Page 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Mt. Weitlohnerkopf Mt.

I Then he listened again to the wireless conversations, but watched the object closely. And he did not wait very long for a. reaction this time. Suddenly the object was covered up with a red glow that hid the rotat- ing lights (Lennartz chose a • color between minium and salmon in our color table, later) and started to rise slowly. It took 4 or 5 minutes for the egg to \"clear the moun- tains,\" said Lennartz; that is a minimum height of 200 meters above the landing spot. \"It was a dazzling red, only the cupola remained yellowish.\" Scarcely had they time to sxchange their opinions, when the egg accelerated rapidly. It dashed towards Hochries hut at terrific speed, growing larger with every second. \"Suddenly I i. noticed static at my carrier wave, but at the same time my transmitting power was rising. I have no test for transmitting power at my set, but Munich and Bosonheim told me they were reading me extra loud.\" At a moment's notice he picked up a crackling, .continuous carrier, similar to static from a not- suppressed motor-scooter, and some stations even complained about the \"unidentified jam- ming station,\" and Lennartz 1 voice spread with maximum vol- ume, although he was unable to explain why. With the mike in his hand he watched the object's approach and had his first lesson in E 8 M. effects associated with the UFO phenomenon. Within 10 sec- onds the egg had travelled be- tween 5 and 6 kilometers and it came to a stand-still less than 2 kilometers away over the Klausenberg slope. In case Lennartz' estimate of 10 kms seconds for 5 kms (measured on the map) was cor- rect, the object approached Hochries hut at supersonic speed (the speed of sound is 330m/sec for 0°C). Its trajec- tory proved to be straight, not parallel to ground level, but going down from 1800 to 1540/50 meters. \"When it was near, you could see once again the running lights,\" Lennartz explained, \"It was soundless and it looked like that...\" He managed to draw a sketch for us with all salient details they had ob- served at 1700/1800 meters dis- tance with binoculars. Dome The curved dome reminded Len- nartz of a cockpit made of per- plex. Its indirect illumination was a soft, dead-yellow color, or white light shining through a semi-transparent cupola. Three or four dark \"ledges\" reached down from the obj ect's top to the lower rim of the \"pilot cabin,\" giving it the appearance of \"pieces for an unfolded parabolic antenna or the greenhouse of an old.,B-52.\" The real startling effect, however, was not the dome. Be- low the rim, four rows of pul- sating, colpred lights whirled around the dark body. Lennartz compared them to \"color organs of a discotheque—red, green, blue and white, white as the lowest line.\" In our summer investigation, we talked with him about the \"strobe belts\" for quite a long time, and Ernst Berger arrived at the conclusion that the effect was basically different from common psychedelic lights, or color organs. Lennartz made clear he did not see rotating dots, chains of bulbs, or the \"phi effect\" known in psychology of visual perception, where se- quential flashes give the im- pression of movement. \"They always went from left to right (counterclockwise), without much system, not all at the same time,\" he said. One \"light\" appeared at the left edge earlier, the next one a bit later and so on. \"Like tubes which would lead, all a- round the body and brighten up\" one light maximum (no point) per \"strobe belt\" moved along at 2 rotations/second. \"Smeared light peaks\" is a better term- inus for the hard nut. At the circumference one more bright \"light\" seemed to circle the large oval clockwise. Whatever it was, one thing is certain: the whole show puzzled Lennartz and Zettel and hid effectively the object's dark surface. \"The surface was rather, gray, maybe metal. Goodness knows.*' Let's review the scene of Dec. 10: The object had! arrived over Klausenberg slope and stopped for half a minute, then continued with a right-angle turn travelling into the direc- tion of Klausenalm hut, in winter an uninhabited property across the Bavarian borderline, in Austria. Two or three min- utes later they saw it hovering 10 to 30 meters over a snowy pasture on a kind of ridge be- Poge 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"tween Mt. Klausenberg and Mt. Zinnenberg (1564 m)„ The static kept crackling in the receiver, so they switched off the set. At 9 p.m. Lennartz noticed a whimpering sound outside the western door of the dining room. When he unlocked the door, he found his St. Bernard dog, Barrie, and Dachshund, Susi, and let them in, but won- dered why they had tried to get in there, because the western door is locked throughout the winter season. Had the object confused the dogs? Klausenalm' hut gave a good size comparison for the next two hours, and Lennartz found his estimates to be correct. Object again reacts Nothing happened until 11:40 p.m., so the landlord decided to try his \"trick\" again and fired another red signal rocket into the south. Quick reaction again: the red \"mantle\" covered up the egg, it accelerated from zero velocity to an extreme rate, and ascended with a slight western deviation. \"It sped upwards at breakneck speed and we lost it among the stars. When it was gone, reception was clear again.\" The object had shrinked into a \"star\" within 30 seconds and into nothing at 11:45 p.m. GET. Corroborotion The Hochries case made'head- lines in Bavaria on December 13, but the details given were sketchy, to say the least. Dipl. Ing. Schneider dug under the surface and, apart from his interview at Hochries, cor- roborating sightings came to light. Bfigitte Drexel, a school- girl, and two of her classmates had been out with their tobog- gans at Zeller Berger near Neu- beuern, when at sunset an oval, orange-colored object appeared in the sky. A Rosenheim .paper received a phone call from Mr. Zoefel,who claimed he had seen on Monday from his flat in the Panorama view from the Hochries Hut of the Dec. 10, 1973, sighting. 5th floor a luminous, multi- colored shape over the moun- tains in the Hochries direc- tion. At 10p.m. the same evening, ham operator Mr. Hoffmann (.\"Neptun I\") from Bernau at Lake Chiemsee spotted a yellow- orange light in the fog about three or four kms to the NE, but only 50 meters above ground level, and \"the size of a bung- alow.\" Similar stories came from tobogganers at Grainbach, Mrs. M. at Neubeuern, and work- ers of the Hochries cable car project. Other sightings Following sightings by var- ious persons in the area on Jan. 3, 1974; February, 1974; March 29, 1974; and Aug. 17, 1974, there was an interesting sighting on Aug. 23, 1974. Thunderstorms and showers hit the Northern Alps, except Hoch- ries and its surroundings. At 8:30 p. m. Friedrich Lennartz left Riesan hut (1444 ml. He said jjood-bye to Mrs. Ramsauer, landlady of Riesen hut, and steered his .jeep into the woods along the first meters of the 2.3 km long rotten track up to Hochries hut. He had only disappeared be- hind the trees when Mrs. Ram- sauer noticed up at Hochries something was going on in front of the starry sky. A strange, lengthy, \"balloony object\" stood upright left of the hut at the peak and gave off a yellow-orange color of spot- light intensity. It illumina- ted the eastern front of Hoch- ries hut brightly, so Mrs. Ram- sauer called her husband and a relative. The three watchedjthe^ eerie sight through Leitz Trinovid 10x40 binoculars. It defin- itely was near, or on, the ground to the south or south- east of Hochries hut, bigger than the house, i.e. about 12 meters high. Unfortunately no telephone line runs from Riesen hut to Hochries hut, and the Ramsauer family has no wireless set either. Within 30 minutes of continuous watch—about the time Lennartz was on his way up the mountain—the \"luminous banana\" appeared at different positions around the hut and at last vanished suddenly. The following day Mrs. Ram- sauer went to see Lennartz and told him of the sighting, but found no traces on the ground near the house at close examin- ation. Whatever had been there, it produced no E. M. effect or residue whatsoever.

Her interest aroused by the phenomenon, she looked out again of a hut window after dusk. Weather was bad on Sat- urday, Aug. 24: Rainfall in the Hochries region and scat- tered thunderstorms, the sky almost overcast, winds below lOkm/hour. Certainly no \"sight- ing weather,\" experienced in- vestigators will say. But 8:30 p.m. arrived and the phenomenon as well. The land- lady was amazed to spot a lumi- nous, motionless object, and quickly she alarmed her hus- band, her sister, her niece, 5 members of the Gabriel family of Frasdorf-Ried, and an ac- quaintance of a Gabriel niece, guests of Riesen hut. The Leitz Tririovid 10x40 was passed on from observer to observer. Mr. Ramsauer later said the object resembled an ellipsoid in horizontal position with solid shape and clear outline despite the falling rain. The ellipse hovered low in the val- ley between Hochries peak and Mt. Klausenberg (the low-flying area of the February object). Franz Gabriel, peasant from Frasdorf-Ried, looked at it with only the naked eye and compared it to a platter seen from the rim, about %. full moon diameter. The 10 witnesses lost it \"at an eye's glimpse\" 5/10 minutes after . Mrs. Ram- sauer's call. The Riesen hut interview also unearthed the sighting of the older Mrs. Ramsauer (56 years), mother of the Riesen hut land- lady. On Saturday evening, Oct. 27, 1973 (note:. 1 day be- fore the \"Traunstein snail manoevers\" at Austria), her daughter had been at a wedding in the neighborhood and the older, Mrs. Ramsauer remained a- lone in the hut. Suddenly a yellow-red, orange-shaped ob- ject seemed to .glide down from Spielberg (1 km distant) to- wards Riesen hut arid throw a \"ghostly light\" onto the dark trees of the landscape. After a turn to the right, it blinked out instantly. Breakdown and parallels Until Dec. 1, 1974, 9 dif- ferent sightings with 10 defi- nite objects, 2 lights, and numerous \"satellites\" on one occasion have been reported by at least 37 persons in the Hochries area (sketchy 1973 reports excluded from break- down), and 18 have been inter- viewed at length by 7 field investigation teams during 6 field trips organized by MUFON, lites\" and the typical \"orange glow\" of the Rochries flap re- ports remind us of the Traun- stein, Austria, manoeveres on Oct. 28/29 and Nov. 17, 1973. Supersonic speed, hours of hovering, and right angle turns are other patterns remarkable of 1973/1974 activity in Cen- tral Europe—and not only Cen-. tral Europe, of course. To publish data on the Hoch- ries flap first, the translator has postponed compilations of an article on his own investi- gations at Traunstein in Sep- tember and November, 1974. Ac- tivity there has developed at the same rate as in Bavaria, and the 13 new reports from Waldviertel Highland show a highly.similar spectrum of pat- terns. The investigators are sorry that bad weather conditions and excessive snowfalls did not en- able a close examination of the possible landing spot at Weit- lahnerkopf in 1973 and early 1974. As we have seen, nothing was found near Hochries hut, the second touchdown area. Geological maps do not indi- cate major tectonic faults run- ning through the flap area, but a remarkable Karst morphology (dolinss, poljes, disappearing wells) is present NE of Hoch- ries hut, especially around Riesen hut and stretching 2 kms further to Laubenstein Basin at Mt. Zellerhorti, where the fam- ous Laubenstein caves are lo- cated. Special ideas and critiques may be addressed to Dipl. Ing.

The graphs correlating size, speed, and resolution with dis- tance, coupled with an approx- imation of the effect of atmos- pheric haze, indicate that the object was at a distance of 1200 feet in the first picture and at 3600 feet in the second. The vehicle appears to be at an angle of 45 degrees relative to the horizon implied by the bottom frame of the picture in the first exposure, but at an angle of 22.5 degrees in the second. However, in both cases the vehicle's angle relative to the sun is +5 degrees, as de- by a study of the reflections on the termined specular craft. Tests cameras with several 35 mm indicate that they typically require two and one- half seconds to cock and re- lease. Therefore we assume that this was the interval be- tween the two exposures and that the vehicle covered some 2400 feet in that amount of time. This is a velocity of 650 miles per hour, less than the speed of sound and not suf- ficiently high to cause a sonic boom (which was not reported in the sighting). The image size indicates that the craft is about 80 feet in diameter and 30 feet tall. It features 16 window-like structures encircling an upper margin, and each of these ports is about three feet tall, six feet wide, and has a three-foot portion of hull between each one. Page 12 i » I EDITOR'S NOTE: The two photos allegedly taken by Mr. Jorma Viita on June 22, 1974, which were described in detail in the December SKYLOOK, have now been analysed by Photo Con- sultant Adrian Vance, who con- cludes that they are \"of an extra- ordinary object that is, in all likeli- hood, not of this earth.\" To date we have not been able to com- municate with the three addition- al witnesses (besides the photog- rapher, there was a German couple living in France, and a Japanese man), but we are con- tinuing our efforts. The photos were obtained by Joe Brill, International Coordinator for MUFON and SKYLOOK. The hull appears to be metal- lic, orange or gold in color, and of sufficiently high luster to cast specular reflections, just as the ports do when they face the sun. This indicates that the ports are a transparent material that reflects the sun at or beyond a certain angle. This angle is called the \"critical angle\" and varies with the wavelength of the light involved. Inasmuch as the reflection is never total and every material ab- sorbs light differently, we may be able to identify the sub- stance from an analysis of this light in a spectrophotometer. In addition, copies of the original image made on Eastman Kodak's Photomicrography Film #2483 show a blue halo not seen on the original and which has not been reproduced with sim- ilar images of ordinary ob- jects. The utter reality of the images, the nature of its re- flections, especially those of its consistent orientation to the sun as well as a report that is consistent with the en- tire history of the sightings of this kind of object lead me to conclude that these are unique photographs of an ex- traordinary object that is, in all likelihood, not of this earth."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"'Gutless and dull' NBC UFO special draws comments Reactions to the Dec. 15 NBC Special, \"UFOs-Do You Believe?\" have generally been negative thus far. Stanton Friedman, former nuclear physicist and currently a well-known lecturer on UFOs, said, \"I was greatly disap- pointed that with a budget of over $200,000 they managed to present so little solid infor- mation, when they had so much.\" .,Friedman was filmed by NBC at the MUFON symposium in Akron last summer. He notes that the entire MUFON convention was filmed, but that much of the dramatic information available was left out. \"NBC surely skipped over the clinchers in almost every in- stance,\" said Friedman in an interview by David Branch in the Santa Ana, Calif..REGISTER. \"For example, there was no mention of radar cases,\" de- spite a large number of reli- able radar trackings.. \"And there was no mention of occu- pant cases, except for the Hickson case,\" even though there are a number of credible sightings of humanoids. Fried- man was particularly unhappy that NBC chose to ignore the impressive work done by Marjo- rie Fish on the Betty Hill star map , and its implications re- garding extraterrestrial life. Friedman also pointed put that there was nothing said a- bout the involvement of scien- tists in the three major UFO organizations, and \"there was no discussion of any of the technological aspects of UFOs. There was no mention of the poll showing that a majority of engineers and scientists be- lieve in UFOs.\" Asked why the NBC production was not better, Friedman said, \"I don't know, but I think, mostly from talking to Craig Leake, the producer-director, that there was a lot of anti- UFO attitudes at NBC. So they were apparently afraid to of- fend anybody and managed, therefore, not to say much that would have nailed things down.\" Friedman concluded, \"This film was gutless and dull.\" Mrs. Norma Short, former editor-publisher of SKYLOOK, said she was \"disappointed\" with the program. \"When Jim Hartz, who narrated the show, was asked later if he believed in UFOs, he said, 'No. Why would anybody spend millions to get here just to pick up some rocks and scare some rabbits? 1 I wanted to say, 'Well, we spent millions to go to the moon and pick up some rocks.'\" Dwight Connelly, the current editor-publisher of SKYLOOK, said, \"I video-taped the pro- gram for future use, but I think it was probably a waste of tape. NBC certainly ignored the best evidence available. I thought the case involving the young boy and Dr. Hynek, who is probably the best-known per- son in UFOs, was unimpressive to say the least. \"The significant work of Ted Phillips on landing cases was virtually ignored, though NBC did have Ted wandering around the Columbia, Mo., site with .a camera while the main witness described the landing. \"When Hartz summarized the UFO phenomenon by saying that there is no evidence but testi- mony by witnesses, I couldn't believe it. What a waste of $200,000.\" Arthur Unger, writing in the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, said the NBC special did \"nothing at all to resolve any of the mys- teries of the flying saucers.\" While suggesting that the special \"makes fascinating viewing,\" Unger concludes that the program \"cops out.\" It of- fers no solutions, no real help for you to come to any valid conclusions.\" MUFON Director Walt 'Andrus said, \"Even though the show did not meet all the expecta- tions of those familiar with the UFO scene, it provided very favorable exposure to the nations viewers of the work and activities of MUFON.\" Andrus added, \"Confidentially, we were a little disappointed in the selection of some of the UFO sighting reports depicted and the inability of the witnesses to present strong and convinc- ing evidence.\" Percy Shain, writing in the .Boston EVENING GLOBE, said the NBC special \"lacked enterprise and initiative, relying largely on previous studies and failing to do enough digging on its own or to contribute anything sub- stantial to the area. NBC's conclusion that it comes down to a matter of belief, 'and we must decide that for our selves,' didn't provide much nourishment in either direc- tion.\" C.W. Skipper, writing in the HOUSTON POST, quotes Producer- Director Leake as saying, \"What you have is witness testimony. We don't solve the mystery in the special. We do make the important point to be made, that the people are the evi- dence. There is nothing else. No photographs or whatever.\" Leake is also quoted as say- ing, \"I had never paid much at- tention to UFO reports, and once I started looking into them I made a conscious effort NOT to believe. That's;^what I tried to do throughout. But I kept reminding myself that whatever is the stimulus of all these reports, there is still a story here.\"   ; NBC began research on the special last May, and the crew began shooting in June.

Ya Furmin, decent of the Voronezh University, became ac- quainted with \"reserve pilot\" Arkadiy Ivanovich Apraksin on the \"Saratov-Moscow\" train and recorded the following: \"A. I. Apraksin spent the entire war in combat aviation. He received the following dec- orations: Red Star, Red Banner, Patriotic War First Class, and the medals \"For the Defense of Stalingrad,\" \"For the Capture of Berlin,\" and \"For Participa- tion in the Patriotic War.\" He showed me the documents award- ing him the decorations and he asked me to record all of this. He insisted that I become fa- miliar with his passport and with the Saratov visa. First sighting \"During 1948-49, Apraksin was working at a test airfield at Kapustin Yar in the Baskun- chak area. He^had to test new combat turbojet airplanes. He flew in the lower zone of the stratosphere. He could stay in the air for up to four hours. He repeatedly received thanks for his outstanding accomplish- ment of missions in testing new equipment. \"On June 16, 1948, he took a regular aircraft into the air. At an altitude of 10,500 meters he found himself above a solid layer of clouds. He flew a- bove this \"milky sea.\" His course was to the south of his take-off point. A half hour after coming out on his course, he observed an aircraft which was of an incomprehensible type and which was flying on a cross course and descending.

Cones of light beams emerged from it in a direction the reverse of the direction of its flight. \"Seeing this apparatus, Apraksin, maintaining radio communication with the airbase all the time, reported what he had seen to the base and re- ceived the reply that the strange object had been picked up on radar and received in- structions to descend (land) but did not follow them. Then, the instruction was given from the base to 'Close with the ob- ject and if it refused to des- cend to open fire on it. 1 Plane disabled \"Executing this order,Aprak^ sin directed his aircraft to meet with the mysterious appar- atus. When he closed in to a- bout ten kilometers, the light beams from the object in the words of Apraksin 'opened up in a fan 1 and burned through his machine, in which regard he was blinded for an instant. At the same instant he discovered that the entire electrical portion of the controls of the airplane and the engine had gone out of operation. Gliding, Apraksin descended and landed without damage. At the last moment, he saw the strange object in a swift jerk, upward, and then, burying itself in the cloud layer, he lost sight of it. \"A detailed statement on this entire incident was prepared. An expert arrived from Moscow who examined the airplane in detail, interrogated the pilot and attempted to tear the ac- count to shreads with cross ex- amination questions, and the complete testimony was recorded in shorthand twice. These were then compared for contradic- tions. \"Then Apraksin was given a 45-day leave which he spent in Gagra and at his home in Sara- tov. ' Apraksin was called back from leave ten days before its end. He was called to Moscow, to the Air Force Directorate of the Ministry of Defense and was sent to a test airfield in the European sector of the Arctic. \"In this new location, Aprak- sin was subjected to a thorough interrogation on the part of the commanders with regard to •that incident 1 in the air. Then he was shown a statement about a similar observation of the same type of apparatus by a pilot whose name was not given to him. In all details of the observation, the statement co- incided with his personal ob- servation. But this pilot called the shape of the .uni- dentified flying object 'elon- gated 1 dirigible-shaped.

A similar sighting \"New equipment arrived, and Apraksin took part in its mas- tery. First instructions were conducted under ground condi- tions. The new airplanes had a ceiling of up to 15,000 meters. Flights into the air began in the spring of 1949. Apraksin flew six shorties. Once, after a flight, another pilot report- ed that he observed something similar to what Apraksin ob- served the previous year, at a great distance from himself. It was an object of elongated form from which bundles of light beams emanated. Again, every- thing was recorded in a state- ment and compared with Aprak- sin 's data. The second pilot did not close in with the uni- dentified aircraft and he en- countered no complications. \"On May 6, 1949, Apraksin took off in a new airplane for a test flight. He flew at a maximum altitude. The cloud cover in the take off area was light but when he found himself at Moscow latitude clouds cov- ered the ground. He established communications with Vol'sk and maintained communications with the base all the time. Second encounter \"Suddenly an incomprehensible aircraft similar to the pre- vious one appeared. It flew considerably lower. Later, it began to descend. Then Aprak- sin directed his aircraft to- ward the 'flying cucumber.' The speeds of both machines were very great and a collision appeared inevitable. At a dis- tance of about ten to twelve kilometers a cone of light beams was again directed at Apraksin.

Zigel turned out that the entire electrical portion of the con- trols were destroyed and, fur- thermore, the front plastic ob- servation window was damaged. The air-tightness of the cock- pit was destroyed and although Apraksin was in a special suit and protective helmet, he ex- perienced a drop in external pressure. \"He was in great trouble, but nevertheless he flew the air- craft, gliding it to the earth. Radio communications with the base ceased. Apraksin. landed the airplane on the right bank of the Volga, forty-nine kilo- meters north of Saratov, with great difficulty and lost cons- ciousness. \"When he came to, he was in a hospital at the base. Again \"his statements and again the experts arrived from Moscow. He lay in the hospital (in Sar- atov) for two and a half months and then was sent to Moscow. He thought they called him to the Air Force Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, but it turned out that he was sent be- fore a special medical board of experts which sent him to a psycho-neurological installa- tion near Moscow. He spent half a year there. He was treated with psycho- therapy and then with shock therapy, which was very agon- izing. Several times people appeared in white coats, pass- ing themselves off as doctors, but they probably were not doc- tors. They made him repeat the entire story and made tape re- cordings as to how Apraksin compared with recordings:of his previous report, apparently hoping to discover contradic- tions. Removed from duty \"In January of 1950 Apraksin went before a medical board which adjudged him 'Group 1 Disabled, 1 removed him from ac- tive duty, summoned his sister to Moscow from Saratov, and turned him over to her. They both took off for Saratov. \"In talking about himself, A. I. Apraksin says that he is in full health, that everything that he experienced is clear in his mind and that he reads ar- tistic and special aviation literature. He does not con- sider himself released from the Air Force but only 'transfered to the reserve.' During 1950 and 1951, he went to the Min- istry of Defense twice and was received by a. deputy minister, but he could achieve nothing concerning his return to active service. \"He was told the same thing everywhere: 'You are over fa- tigued, you are threatened with cock and bull stories, and you are not suitable for military service much less the Air Force.' But he assures me that he is in perfect health, that everything which he saw occurr- ed in fact, that they do not want to consider him normal for reasons which he cannot under- stand, and that the failure to believe his story will bring harm to the Motherland.\" This report was obtained by Decent I.

The ENQUIRER quotes Grant as saying, \"I've seen the original cave painting which is repro- duced as a line drawing in Von Daniken's book.

Because of the frequency be- ing used and the \"skip dis- tance\" involved, the seventy- five meter band has been, very satisfactory for the purpose intended, but our members on both coasts have been clammer- ing for additional nets that will serve both coasts. Ron Anderson, WA9PAM, has been handling radio communications with our members in Australia and South Africa on the high frequency amateur bands. Joe Santangelo, MUFON State Director for Massachusetts and amateur Radio Operator WINXY, is the Net Control Station for a forty meter net that meets each Saturday morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time between 7235 and 7238 KHZ. Joe's QTH is 194 Barbara Road, Waltham, Massa- chusetts 02154; telephone: AC 617 893-3257. The net will be concluded by 9:00 a.m. E.S.T. so as to relay UFO reports and information from the eastern states to MU- FON administrative offices in Quincy, IL. K8CCG, Bob in Mus- kegon, MI.; W0SWY, Don, in Mt. Pleasant, IA.; and WA9WMK, Don, in Bloomington, IN., will try to report in on both nets. The MUFON Eastern Net started informally on Jan. 25 and..will officially be in operation on Feb. 1. Joe is taking this op-: portunity to invite any amateur radio operator interested in the UFO phenomenon to call in during the \"controlled net\" operation. 'Ancient Sightings' topic in St. Louis The January meeting of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis featured a talk on \"Ancient UFO sightings\", by Clarence Dargie, a description of a. recent UFO sighting by Debbie Jannett, and the film \"In Search of Ancient Myster- ies.\" More- than 200 attended the meeting, and an estimated 100 additional persons had to be turned away because of space limitations, according to David A. Schroth, who reported the meeting. Dargie, MUFON State Section Director and Field Investiga- tor, told.the group that \"there are accounts of UFOs in the writings of every civilization on this earth, without excep- tion.\" He cited, . for example, the Sumerian legend of \"gods\" who came down to the earth in gigantic . metal .eggs, built cities, and taught men archi- tecture, mathematics, and other arts. He also referred to the Mahabharata (the chronicles of India), and suggested that a story contained therein may indicate that numerious tech- nological civilizations have flourished on earth over a period of millions of years. Ms. Jannett, of Carlyle, IL., gave a brief account of her sighting on the night of Jan. 1, 1975. She said she was re- turning home about 9:30 p.m. in an auto, and that a huge yel- lowish-orange object followed her car. She said she kept the object in view for 10-15 min- utes, and estimated its size as equal to approximately three moons.

The translation was by Miss Linda Galloway, Quincy, IL. The photo was pro- vided by Joe Brill, International Coordinator. The photo on this month's cover, was reportedly taken in France on the night of March 23, '1974, by a doctor. The color slide of the object was left on the windshield of an auto owned by Jean Bedet, a French UFO investigator, who was visiting in the village of Tavernes, France, on April 14, 1974. With the slide was a note which read: \"Sir, Excuse me for this procedure. I am a doctor and you will understand my position. I took this slide the night of March 23 on the route D 15, near the outskirts of Albiosc while I was return- ing to,my home. My camera is a Canon 24x36 (35mm) with a tele- photo 135mm 2.8 lens. Once a- gain please excuse me.\" Bedet, upon finding the note, was \"happy and skeptical at the same time, because this piece of paper had no signature on it.\" Bedet attempted to get word to the anonymous doctor that the doctor's. anonymity would be honored, but received no response. \"He must know me,\" reasoned Bedet, \"or else he saw the LDLN (the French UFO maga- zine) sticker on the rear win- dow of my car.\" The image on the slide was similar to descriptions given by witnesses, which included Bedet's wife, to a sighting in Tavernes on March 23, the date the photo was allegedly taken. Mr. Bedet, along with two.other UFO researchers, had set up a UFO vigil, complete with de- tector equipment, cameras, lights, and recorders, at a small cabin in the region of Barjols on March 23, but had seen nothing at the mountain top location. The next day they went into the village of Tavernes, where they were told of the sighting of a reddish object with green lines. The object was first spotted by Mrs. Bedet, who had stayed in the village while her hus- band and the others had gone up into the mountains to set up the UFO detection/communication unit. She was in the yard when she spotted the object, which she said was very high in the sky, about 11 p.m. The weather .was clear and cool (Tavernes is at an altitude of about 1,350 feet). When first seen, the reddish object, about the size of Venus, had green lines pointed upward from it. Mrs. Bedet called Mr. and Mrs. C. M., who also saw the object, but now the green lines were pointed downward. Mr. C.M. took sight- ings from the angle of the house, trees, and other sta- tionary objects, which permit- ted Mr. Bedet to later obtain fairly precise bearings. The object had been located above the mountain at 30° NE at a height of 17°, in alignment with Moustier-Sainte-Marie. As the three witnesses watch- First view . Second view ed, the object went up, des- cended, went to the right, to the left, then to the right to remain for a time. As the wit- nesses were getting cold, they went home at 11:30 p.m. In looking for \" other wit- nesses, Bedet found 18-year-old A. Bernardi, who said one of his friends saw the object in question. After finding the slide left by the doctor, Bedet took it to the witnesses. \"When they saw the slide,\" Bedet related, \"They cried, \"That's it exact- ly. 1 \" In analysing the photo, Bedet explained, \"We know that it was, according to the wit- nesses, in the direction of Moustiers-Sainte-Marie. Let us trace the line of direction. We know that it seemed far away and not much bigger than Venus. In addition, the anonymous doc- tor said that he was on D 15 on the outskirts of Albiosc. The village is in a valley, the high point is situated on the plateau between Quinson and Al- biosc and lends itself to the observation. The photo, even with the telephoto lens, shows that the object was relatively near. The closest area on the axis of the direction Tavemes- Moustiers is situated in the area of\"Villeneuve near Regus- se,\" Thus, according to Bedet's calculations, the object was probably near Regusse when the photo was taken.

SUBMITTED BY: Roberto Rendueles of Madrid through Joe Brill, International Coordinator. TRANSLATED BY: Bill Armstrong. While details are sketchy and in part contradictory, it appears that some sort of UFO landed on the firing range at Bardenas Reales on Jan. 2. The range is used by both the Span- ish air force and the \"North American Air Force stationed in Europe\" for training and firing exercises. According to the Madrid newspaper, INFORMACIONES, \"The military authorities of the III Air Force Region have appointed a judge who will hear the case concerning the unidentified flying object.\" The hearing will be taken to the Ministry of the Air Force. The paper speculates that \"the appearance on this range of an unidentified flying ob- ject can be due to one of the many electronic countermeasures exercises which the air forces carry out periodically. If this were the case (and the designation, for the first time, of a special judge would seem to indicate it), the mili- tary secrecy which surrounds these exercises will probably prevent all public information about the affair.\" The UFO was apparently re- ported by a Lt. Campos, who is on the staff at the firing range. According to the Madrid newspaper, Lt. Campos refuses to provide any information on the sighting because the case is in the hands of military authorities and \"under judg- ment.\" The object was also re- portedly seen by other \"sold- iers from the detachment. The UFO was described as \"giving off rapid flashes\" dur- ing the short time it was on the ground. After taking off, the object \"immediately was lost in the sky.\" The newspaper reports that a \"flying accident\" involving a \"North American Phantom jet\" MUFON European group formed The December 10, 1973, Hoch- ries sighting, reported else- where - in this issue, was not only an important event of the Central European scene in late 1973, but also the catalyst, together with the \"Traunstein snails\" reported in October, to speed up cooperational.efforts among German, Swiss, and Aus- trian amateurs. In the summer of 1974, at Innsbruck, Austria, immediate integration of all German- speaking and scientifically- orientated researchers into a Central European section of the Mutual UFO Network (Quincy, 111., USA) was decided at a two-day, privately-organized UFO meeting. MUFON's Central European Sec- tion is an investigative body trying to cover the long-neg- lected Central European scene with a broad spectrum of in- quiries. All findings of MUFON, C.E.S., will be published by VSkylook.\" Meanwhile the Hoch- ries affair expanded into a lo- cal flap. The same effect was noticed at Traunstein. Field investigations at the sites of numerous Hochries observations have been conducted by Dipl. Ing. Adolf Schneider of Munich, electronics engineer and author of a German UFO book; Dipl. Phys.

The Jan. 5 issue of NATIONAL TATTLER devoted' two pages to the \"crashed saucers and little men\" story which has gotten so much publicity recently.

I did not learn of the Dick- inson article on the Hill/Fish \"star map\" in the Dec. issue of ASTRONOMY in time to mention it in last month's column. How- ever, Dwight has already done that most ably, so I will echo his comments and urge you to read this excellent article. Ralph Blum contributes a UFO article to the Jan. issue of TRUE. No new material here, but the old data are presented in Ralph's always-excellent style. It's good to see TRUE devoting \" space to UFO material again. B. Ann Slate's article in Feb.

Major Donald E.

Not, I hasten to add, that I a- gree with the comments quoted above! But, whether or not you agree with Steiger's ideas on UFOs, you'll find a wide vari- ety of Forteana within the pages of MYSTERIES OF TIME AND SPACE. Atlantis, archaeologi- cal \"erratics,\" Abominable Snowmen, poltergeists, myster- ious photographic effects— you'll find all these and more in the book, along with Stei- ger 's underlying theme that reality is largely what we make it. As I've said, I don't go for the concept that UFOnauts and \"Men in Black\" are no more than glorified mental images. It seems likely to me that many of the phenomena associated with UFOs are considerably more \"substantial\" than Steiger seems to think, Even so, there is a lot of fascinating mater- ial in this new book and I rec- ommend it highly. Whether or not you can accept Steiger 1 s ideas of reality, he will give you some things to ponder. The publisher is Prentice-Hall, Inc. (Englewood Cliffs, N. J. 07632) and the price is $7.95. Duck, Erich, here we go again! I am referring, of course, to von Daniken, his theories, and his detractors. The most recent volume taking the Swiss author to task is entitled SOME TRUST IN CHARI- OTS. It is a compilation of writings by sixteen -Australian authorities, all of whom seem intent on demolishing the en- tire \"ancient astronaut\" con- cept. Well, I'm the first to admit that von.Daniken is slop- py in his research and one of the world's foremost conclus- ion-jumpers, but I can't say that I'm much more impressed with the arguments put forth by the \"it isn't true because it can't be true\" school of thou- ght. Von Daniken's basic premise—shorn of his over- .zealousness and carelessness— has a great deal to recommend it. By all means, correct his errors—intentional or other- wise—but let's don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. I suggest you read SOME TRUST IN CHARIOTS, remembering that the contributors have their biases and vested interests also.

In discussing historical and Biblical records, he comes up with an anomalous artifact which von Daniken and all the others of his ilk seem to have overlooked—a diffraction grat- ing found in an Egyptian tomb of the 3rd or 4th Dynasty. As Macvey says, \"....despite the ability of the ancient Egyp- tians to work with metals, there is little doubt that the production of a diffraction grating would have been beyond their powers.\" Such tidbits as this make the book well worth reading.

SUBMITTED BY: Dr. Marco Marianti, MUFON Representative for Italy, through Joe Brill, International Coordinator. Two separate night sightings and possible landing traces were reported in the Ravenna area on the night of July 8-9. Bruno Minvallo, who was in the gatekeeper's house of Lugo on the highway to Ravenna, said that on the night of July 8 he observed a mysterious light move across the sky in relation to the highway, and that the light seemed to maintain a height of about 10 meters (30 feet) above the highway. He re- ported the sighting to police. A little later that night a similar report was made to the police by the driver of an auto, Roberto Imolesi, and four passengers. \"We were traveling to Bologna,\" said Imolesi, \"when at Barbiano I noticed a light in the distance, at the center of the highway, right a- bove the white line.\" Thinking it was a reflection, he said nothing until one of the pas- sengers, Gianni Morone, noticed it and asked Imolesi to stop the car. \"I got out of the car,\" ex- plained Imolesi, \"and noticed that the light, yellow and dark, was at the center of a huge wing, not very well de- fined in the darkness. I had the impression that it was in the form of a cap with a visor, and had a diameter of approxim- ately fifteen meters (45 feet).

An important feature of the Spanish truckdriver case (re- peated encounters with UFOs and occupants along a highway, March, 1974) is the reported failure of the truck's diesel engine—the first such E-M ef- fect on a diesel, to my know- ledge. Aime Michel in FLYING SAUCERS AND THE STRAIGHT LINE MYSTERY (p. 211, fn 7) reports an in- cident in Forli, Italy, 11-14- 54, when a UFO passed over a • standard-ignition tractor and a diesel tractor operating side- by-side; the standard tractor engine failed but- the diese] continued to operate. This and one or two other case's have hinted that whatever physical forces are involved, they must be operating on the conventional spark plug system. Have the' reporters only as- sumed that the truck had a die- sel motor or is this an estab- lished fact? Either way we have a lesson for UFO investi- gators: Always obtain complete identification (.year, make, etc.) of any vehicle which has been affected by a UFO, and especially details of its ig- nition/motor system (exact model, number of cylinders, spark plugs, battery, etc.) Only then will scientists and engineers have some place to begin unraveling the mystery of E-M effects. According to my trusty 1969 Britannica (which has a good survey of diesel engines), die- sels for highway vehicles have electric starters similar to those for automobiles, but the fuel is ignited by pressure/ heat rather than spark plugs,. Battery capacity-must be much greater than that of automo- biles, and 24-volt batteries are commonly used. However, some tractor diesels incorpo- rate gasoline fuel and spark ignitions to start the diesel engine. Thus the exact arrangement must be known in order to figure out the possible signif- icance of E-M effects in a given case. Ford Motor Company consultants to the Colorado Project also told me that, in cases of headlight failures, it is important to obt-ad-ri'.data on the exact kinds of relays and fuses. The ideal would, be schematic -diagrams of the par- ticular motor and electrical system in question. ***** Even though the Ohio steel ball has never clearly been a UFO-related mystery, the thor- ough follow-up by MUFON person- nel and others is highly com- mendable. Such tests or \"dry. runs\" serve to sharpen investi- gative and analytical skills' and to develop the network of communications. Project Starlight Interna- tional ('PSIJ seems to have demonstrated a vital point: Hard data can be obtained if a systematic effort' is made to do so. The ^companion story about the Center for UFO Study's ef- forts with instruments at the Yakima Indian Reservation re- r ports another step in the right direction.. 'PS.I' s planned array of instrumentation seems highly appropriate. , •• • Professional skeptics' who delight, in TV appearances as ? \"UFO experts,\" decrying the lack of \"hard'evidence,\" take head. Who is being;more scien- tific about UFOs—those who de- bunk on theoretical grounds and don't lift a finger to obtain evidence, or those who vigor- ously seek out more evidence? stronomy By Mark Herbsrritt , Mercury—is too close to Sun for easy observation, being j in inferior conjunction on 8th.
