Another example (Idaho, 1975) .appears in this issue, and the Harry Joe Turner case (Virginia, August 1979) in which a trucker says he was abducted and flown to an alien world will be reported soon. Fred Whiting has completed a preliminary investigation of Turner, with the counsel of several of us in the Washington, D.C., area. We have reviewed the follow-up investigation necessary to check on Turner's reliability as a witness. ' Nothing overtly derogatory about him has been uncovered to date. It is important to understand that investigation consists of far more than merely obtaining an elaboration of the story from the witness. A hard and critical look must be taken at the witness* personality, motivation, lifestyle, character, and family dynamics, among other things. Various hypotheses must be explored other than that the witness is relating a factual experience; this includes hoax, publicity-seeking, financial gain motive, and mental disturbance. Without such investigation — and it must be expert and exhaustive — we are left with nothing but entertaining stories. Are the new-wave abductees only the latest form of \"contactees\" (combining various ulterior motives and abnormal mental states), or is something far more significant involved? Only meticulous investigation will provide meaningful answers. In this issue ANOTHER ABDUCTION BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS?  3 By Terry A.

By Terry A. Hartman (Copyright 1979, Terry A. Hartman;  ' All Rights Reserved.) It was in August 1977..I had just completed a number of radio and TV talk shows in the Portland and Seattle areas dealing with my hypnosis research into the UFO enigma. Being the Mutual UFO Network state director for Oregon and investigator for the Center for UFO Studies gave me the opportunity to discuss some of my findings to the public. As a clinically trained hypnotherapist I had the ability to work with said abductees and to disclose some of the patterns of these cases to the media. The public in general rarely gets to know what is going on with UFO research. So my contributions on public talk shows are always welcome. I was in my study doing some work about 7:00 PM one evening when the phone rang. It was from a woman by the name of Toni M... She said that she and her husband experienced a strange phenomenon 2 years before (1975) in the eastern desert of Oregon while on a 3-day camping trip. She explained they were doing some archaeological digs in a familiar area, but couldn't account for 2 hours of missing time and other unusual happenings. Plus Darryl, Toni's husband, had become extremely depressed, which resulted in the loss of his job as a mechanic and the relocating to another city. She wanted to know if I could come to their home in western Portland, Oregon, the following week to discuss it. This was the beginning of a long and intense investigation. Both Toni and Darryl are really exceptional people: very warm, kind, and considerate. Toni pointed out to me on my initial visit that she has always been psychic (clairvoyant), but the experience in 1975 enchanced this phenomenon. They told me about a storm and the washing away of the road on their trip . . . that no one else experienced in the area. That they were in their boat on a lake and a water skier almost hit them as if they did not exist. And that in the present case they got home 2 hours later than normal on a regular 6-hour trip. (They often go to this location a number of times a year.) They told me so many interesting things about their lives and this experience that I spent almost 7 hours with them. I mentioned to them my hypnosis qualifications and that I'd like to work with them to uncover Darryl's depression and why Toni's ability to be psychic was enchanced. They didn't say yes or no, but that they'd let me know. I left their house with a feeling of emptiness. Seven hours of interview, on the brink of a case dealing with some very unknown forces of metaphysics and nothing about UFOs. But it was all intriguing. One week later I received another call from Toni saying they decided to do hypnotherapy. When I asked why the hesitation at first, she said they thought I might be with the government and wanted time to check me out. Keep in mind many people with abnormal encounters are afraid of ridicule or of losing their jobs, especially if they feel the government knows about it. We started work the next week. The first couple of sessions were very involved and time-consuming. I had to keep both Darryl and Toni separate because I didn't want them to compare notes with each other between sessions. Plus-I had to take both of them to deep levels so I could induce amnesia into their recent replies to the questions. This procedure is common as it offers the hypnotist a freshness in their subject's mind before the next session. It also eliminates the possibility of the subject recalling the incident consciously, thus keeping them from deductive reasoning and their own conclusions. After over 30 hours of sessions (combined), I came to some conclusions that I kept to myself for a couple of weeks. Then I returned fpr extremely intense work. But first, here are .my preliminary findings: The location was 82 miles SW of Boise, Idaho, in eastern Oregon along the Owyhee River. It was summertime and hot when they were camping and on their way home they stopped at a small creek to cool off and to allow their pick-up truck to do the same. (They were pulling a boat up a long, winding hill.) As Darryl took his shirt off by the side of the truck he noticed a strange plane fly past the hillside. The unusual'part'of it was it looked like a B-52 bomber, with no sound. Toni saw a plane too, but it looked to heV like a supersonic jet, with no sound, Neither one of them thought enough of their own sightings to mention it to the.other. Not until I did hypnosis did this phenomenon come out. The next thing they both remembered consciously was a shiny object sitting across the valley from them on an adjoining hillside. Again, they never mentioned it to each other later. Then they got back into their truck and noticed it started up right away. This was unusual as when the truck is warm it is difficult to start. Darryl noticed the temperature gauge read \"cold.\" (It would take over an hour to cool off on this hot day.) But again no. problem or concern on-their end. They drove home with no unusual circumstances except that the hill they were climbing by the creek is quite steep and according to other trips there they had to drive in 2nd gear. On this trip they drove up it extremely fast, in 3rd gear. When they got home they realized it took them longer, by two hours, than usual. This didn't make sense to them, expecially driving faster than normal. Most of these details I mentioned weren't disclosed until' the hypnosis sessions commenced. The next group of sessions went this way: After each saw his own interpretation of the plane and the shiny object on the hill, they began to walk towards the object as if in a trance, Darryl first, Toni following 10 feet (continued on next page) . \"'."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Abduction, Continued) . behind. When Darryl reached the object he touched it and said it felt like teflon. He noticed a hole in the side of it that wasn't there when he arrived. As he crawled up the newly \"materialized\" ladder he turned back to look at Toni. She was standing there looking at him in a daze. At this point in our sessions Darryl was unable to remember anymore. Toni on the other hand.didn't remember Darryl or herself going into the hole, but did remember being inside this object. (From now on both Toni and Darryl separately began calling the object a craft, a ship.) They both said the door was octagonal with rounded corners and the color of the ship was a dull silver. Darryl still maintained an amnesia for more details but Toni talked about the walls on the inside as very dark, with small lights. Then, she couldn't go any further either. What happened here is a common occurrence. Once the subconscious part of the mind (remembering all past data) begins to open up, the conscious part .tries to cover it up. Similar to an automobile accident where the victim has a hard time remembering the details and has to resort to hypnosis to open the amnesia. It's our built-in defense mechanism to protect us from mental side effects of an uncomfortable experience. What I had to do here was to condition them more intensely to uncover the rest. It should be ' mentioned here that while asleep the subconscious part of the mind is active. Thus Toni experienced some phenomena that were uncomfortable. Darryl, not knowing about the details in her sessions, became concerned. I assured him we would get it all out in the open soon so they may rest both on the physical as well as the mental planes. One more month went by with me working on the subconscious level on both Toni and Darryl. They were now ready for the most intense sessions that were a part of this case. In the interim Toni continued her hallucinations while asleep. Once she saw an entity at the end of the bed who called himself \"Ahab.\" He told her he knew her from her \"visit.\" I told her it was just an hallucination and not to worry. However, she said she knew I was getting close to something, or so she felt. And she was right. There was no way I could know of the outcome and it took a total of over 46 hours of hypnosis on tape with both of them before the A SIHPLE SKETCH OF THE naTE ''~ r ' T -ftf 1 - \"V lights, colors, protrusions) Initial sighting as sketched by Darryl following information was allowed to come out: Toni found herself standing inside the room where all the lights were, when a wall turned into a doorway that opened. She walked in. (Keep in mind while this whole experience happened they were both in a trance.) When she entered the other room she noticed Darryl lying on his back on a table with his arms and legs strapped down. The room was white in color and had curved walls. There were a couple of .chairs by a small table across the room and a strange instrument hanging over Darryl. One wall had a round window that was at first black, then a»if a shade was being drawn up. Outside were clouds; then, a view of Earth. On the opposite wall a doorway emerged and slid'Open. Out walked two people. Not Earthlings. One taller than the other; they ranged from 5'2\" to 5'8\". They were wearing uniforms. Dark grey in color with the same color for skin. Their hands exposed wrinkly skin like a dried apple and \"balloon\"-type fingers. Their faces were of the same skin texture with no features for ears and slits for a mouth, nose, and eyes. They had no visible hair. The two people came over to Toni and communicated to her with a sound like \"buzzing bees.\" However, like many of these cases she understood them through telepathy or. some form of sound frequency change. They meant no harm. They did not mean for her to follow Darryl but because she was psychic they thought she could handle the experience eventually. This was the message they gave her. The two turned to Darryl and proceeded to examine him with the machine above him. It produced a pin beam of light that they used to scan his body. The reason was not disclosed to Toni. Perhaps to find something we don't know about yet. One of the entities grabbed Darryl's right arm and pulled sharply above and below the elbow as to stretch the arm, which caused great pain to Darryl. (He hurt his elbow when young and could never completely straighten it out since.) While under hypnosis explaining this, Darryl screamed out \"They're hurting my arm.\" I relieved him of the pain and he said that after informing them of this they took the pain away while examining him. He said they were friendly but he could not see them because his eyes were closed all the time on the ship. When I asked why, he stated because he couldn't open them in the trance he was in. This was the extent of the physical encounter. They were released and returned to their truck to find the engine cold and started for home. The experience Toni and Darryl had was rewarding for them. Toni has become more intuitive and grateful; Darryl no longer has trouble with his arm (they evidently healed it) and more importantly found out why he became so depressed for the 2 years between the experience and our sessions. He feels that these entities were so full of love that it made him upset to see our planet the way it is. His subconscious was allowing this feeling of sadness to prevail to him only on that level, thus not knowing the basis for his depression. It should be noted here that before our acquaintance Darryl did go to see a psychologist, but was too emotional for hypnosis therapy. It has now been over a year since my last session with Toni and Darryl and they both are happy and prosperous. There is no doubt in their minds of the experience they had and no doubt in my mind that they believe in this experience on both a conscious and subconscious level. D"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MYSTERY DEEPENS IN PILOT DISAPPEARANCE CASE By Paul Norman (MUFON State Representative for Victoria, Australia) Since April 1, I have been touring the United States and Canada, talking with UFO Researchers, reading commercial UFO magazines, watching TV programs, listening to radio talkbacks, and making a survey of the public with regard to the attitude of people in general and ufologists in particular concerning the subject of UFOs. I have found that opinions here as well as in Australia are easily swayed by journalists and authors who write about everything .and are experts on nothing. Thus, much confusion exists not only in most every subject but in the field of ufology in particular. A typical example is that of the pilot Frederick Valentich's dis- appearance over Bass Strait, between Victoria and Tasmania, on October 21, 1978, as he was being buzzed by a UFO. Although, this was the twentieth known case, journalists were treating the incident as the first ever. Many newsmen were giving the occurrence their own pet twist, demonstrating their ignorance of solid serious cases being reported from all over the world. For instance, there was the pet twist of a particular Melbourne newsman, \"Anyone who reports a UFO has been drinking or smoking pot.\" Naturally, his non-investigative opinion of the last sound heard after the voice of Valentich faded was that of \"beer cans being rubbed together.\" This sort of statement would be readily snapped up by such non-investigating \"experts\" as Phil Klass, but does not convey the facts. Even the officials have stated the sound to be like a \"metallic click.\" Guido Valentich, the pilot's father, was permitted to hear an edited copy of the tape at the request of the officials for the purpose of identifying his son's voice. His report to investigators from the Moorabbin-based Victorian UFO Research Society (VUFORS) confirms that the sound was that of a metallic click. Mr. Valentich, in a recorded interview before the above-mentioned investigators, also stated there was no sound of fear in his son's voice as long as the pilot thought the object was another aircraft. During the last few statements of the transmission when his son realized the object was not an aircraft is the only time his voice broke with fear. The father stated that an unusual amount of static was heard toward the end of the transmission. Repeated efforts of the press and investigators have failed to secure the full tape. The officials desperately refuse to release the tape in full. The primary reason for the desired release is because this strange event was at first being treated as an ordinary aircraft disappearance. However, between 7:00 and 7:30 on that same evening, other pilots were flying and tuned to the same frequency. Several witnesses heard the pilot's final words. One of these pilots decided to tip the press. Thus, the world learned about this strange encounter. Two more reports have since been received from aviation sources. One of them is that pilot Valentich was on a mission for the Defense Department. According to a report from another pilot, Valentich was instructed to change to another frequency for a message. According to another pilot who followed through with change of frequency, the message came from the Defense Department, instructing Valentich to check on an unknown target since he was the only pilot in that vicinity. It is a confirmed fact that the first question from Valentich to Melbourne Flight Service frequency, at 7:06, was \"Is there any known traffic below five thousand?\" Perhaps sooner or later, other pilots will decide to speak up and make known to the outside world the total dramatic description of this encounter with the unknown. Two months prior to this fateful event, UFO reports were coming'from all over King Island and were being passed on to the police and King Island News. Victorian and Tasmanian Investigators are still in the process of investigating the origin and build-up of these sightings when a slow-moving UFO was reported to be passing a motorist, then disappearing at low level over a nearby house. At Maatsuyker Island, a large light hovered low to the west of the island for nearly. 2 hours, while power in the lighthouse keepers residence is reported to have failed. Erratically, moving lights and daylight sightings were also being widely reported as far south as Hobart, Tasmania. These reports have been followed up by investigators of the Tasmanian UFO Research Centre. This famous flap reached its peak on October 21, the day Valentich vanished. On that same day and night something strange '. was in the Melbourne and Victorian skies. That is the inescapable conclusion from startling files of evidence compiled by investigators in that immediate vicinity. Documented interviews with unrelated people from locations up to 150 miles apart told similar stories, of round objects, star-fish objects, and two silver cigar-shaped objects moving slowly in the sky with no apparent means of propulsion, no wings, and no sound. Here are some reports from observers. Names are on file with the Victorian UFO Research Society and the Tasmanian UFO Research Centre: Currie, King Island, 2 p.m., Oct. 21: A young housewife was sunbathing in her back yard. The sky was clear, except for one large cloud directly overhead. Out of this cloud came an object similar to a huge golf ball about a quarter size of the moon. The object (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Disappearance, Continued) was white or silver in color and moved slowly to the west toward the sea. She thought it most likely a satellite. However, it stopped at an angle of 70 degrees to the ground, then started moving back in the direction from whence it came. Mrs. K. watched for approximately 10 minutes, then had to leave and saw no more of it and thought no more about it until the pilot story broke the next day. Corio, Victoria, 3 p.m., Oct. 21: Less than an hour after the King Island UFO was seen, 12 tennis players on courts near Geelong, together with a number of cricket players, watched twin cigar-shaped objects moving slowly from west to east. The objects, described as silvery in color and connected together with two silver pipes, were moving with no visible *means of propulsion, no sound, and no wings. The UFOs were first seen at an angle of 75 degrees, moving west to east. Size of both objects was estimated as slightly smaller than jumbo jets. Cape Qtway, Victoria, 4:15 p.m., Oct. 21: One hour after these twin UFOs were last seen, Mrs. G. of Geelong, and her 14-year old son were driving to their weekender on Cape Otway. When a silver glint caught their eye, they looked up and saw two silver cigar-shaped objects moving slowly from the southwest. Mrs. G. at first thought the twin objects were gliders, but after noting they had no wings she stopped the car to step out for a better look. The UFOs remained in close formation, with one slightly behind the other. The observers were puzzled by the precision flying. The two objects maintained the same distance from each other during the entire period of observation. The size was estimated as about that of light aircraft. If these were the same UFOs as reported near Geelong 1 hour earlier, they were flying at a higher elevation and too high for any connection to be seen. Suddenly, the objects changed color to white, made a sweeping curve to the north and sped away. The mother and son could hear no sound. Cape Otway, Victoria, 6:45 p.m., Oct. 21: Just 21 minutes before pilot Valentich told Melbourne Flight Service he was being buzzed by a UFO, 6 Roy Manifold, of Melbourne, photographed on 35 mm film an object hurtling in a blur of speed and mist out of the ocean near Cape Otway lighthouse. All modes of computer analysis were used to gain data, including edge enhancement, color contouring, digitizing, computerizing and filtering. Analysis was made by Ground Saucer Watch and critique issued by William H. Spaulding, GSW Director. Publication of the photo brought the officials out of their corner for the umpteenth debunking attempt: \"The photo showed a cloud or a puff of smoke.\" VUFORS advisors quickly exploded the hasty announcement. The object appears only in the last six pictures taken at roughly 20-second intervals. The length of these intervals is confirmed by the setting sun's position. In the last picture the so-called cloud is already 9 degrees into the frame. This means it would have sped into the shot at up to 200 mph— impossible for a cloud on a calm day. Altona (Western Suburb of Melbourne), 6:50 p.m.: A doctor and his wife observed a round object with beams of light toward Geelong about three times larger than the evening star. They watched the object for only 5 minutes thinking no more about it until they read about the pilot's remarks the next day. Near Cape Otway over Bass Strait from 7:06 to 7:12: Frederick Valentich's sighting and disappearance. Frankston (Southern suburb of Melbourne), 7:10 p.m., Oct. 21: A Frankston widow, her 14-year-old son, 16-year-old daughter and friend, Janie, age 16, were motoring to a property to the south of Frankston, when they noted a glowing object to the southeast. Their impression was the exhaust of a sky rocket, although, the object was stationary. The sighting occurred just before darkness. The sky was clear. The color appeared to be a mixture of red, pink, and white. The five observers estimated its size as about one-quarter of the moon at a 30 degree angle. The viewers lost sight of the object when they turned onto another road. The mother said that at the time of sighting she did not realize it was a UFO, but found later that other people had seen the same' thing and had thought no more about it until news of the missing pilot became known the following day. Brooklyn (Western suburb of Melbourne), 7:10 p.m., Oct. 21: Bank Manager, Mr. C. Morgan, and others observed a star-fish shaped object over the Melbourne-Geelong road. They noticed green flickering lights at one end. They have the impression that they had watched the object being described by Valentich. Ormond (Southern Suburb of Melbourne), 7:15 p.m., Oct. 21: Mrs. G. McNiece was standing in Wicklow Street, when she noticed srahge lights to the northeast. She was busy directing her children across a busy street and only had a brief look. The lights appeared to fall or were turned off from top to bottom. They looked like \"silver rain.\" At first glance the lights • appeared to be arranged in shape of a cigar. Elwood (Southern Melbourne Suburb), 7:15 p.m., Oct. 21: Mr. James Mortimer reported a red object moving over the bay in a south to\" west direction. He called attention to his cab driver who agreed it was not a known object: Ringwood (Eastern Suburb of Melbourne), 8:00 p.m., Oct. 21: Report by John Thompson of VUFORS: At about 8:00 p.m., David and Martin of Ringwood were out playing with their walkie-talkies down at the end of 'their street. They were no more than 50 yards apart when Kim, who was standing on the rise of a hill, noticed a star-shaped object in the NW at a very low altitude estimated at 2,500-3,000 feet. The object moved slightly faster than an aircraft on an approach run, heading in a NE direction where it disappeared behind a grove of tall pine trees. During the observation both witnesses recall that a sound like a low pulsating hurri was associated with the object, but once out of view was not audible any longer. Each of their communicators became inundated with static so that even within 3 minutes walking distance they were inoperable. The object appeared from their description to have bright white lights placed intermittently at each tip of the star-fish-shaped object and at various points along the arcs to the tips. The hull itself had irregularly placed (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"HUMANOID ENCOUNTERS IN MALAYSIA By Ahmad Jamaludin (West Malaysia MUFON Representative) UFO occupants or \"humanoids\" present themselves in various shapes and sizes,,as do the UFOs themselves. Worldwide reports have from time to time given rise to new types or species of humanoids, from small winged creatures to huge hairy creatures. But from reports as early as 1897 it has become clear that one type — the 4 feet-5 inches Oriental type — has been consistent. They were seen widely in France during the great 1954 UFO wave and continued to be sighted as recently as 1979 in South Africa. While other countries have been experiencing close encounters with humanoids of diversified forms, I would like to draw attention to the reports in', Malaysia where humanoid encounters have been confined to only one type — tiny entities measuring from 3 inches to 6 inches in height. Though reports of the other UFO categories bear similarity to the global sightings, encounters with humanoids in Malaysia on the record so far are in a class of their own. There has not been a single reported incident of encounters with UFO occupants measuring taller than 6 inches in height. If is also to be noted that there has not been a single case of a UFO measuring greater than 3 feet in diameter landing - on Malaysian soil. These observations constitute a puzzle, and if any explanations can be given it is. hoped that some relationship' with the global UFO landings may give a clue to the UFO phenomena.

They both distinctly remember one bright light which appeared in the middle of the underside. Queensclift, Victoria (Across bay southwest of Melbourne), 9:00 p.m.; Mrs. Barbara Bishop reported an object which appeared to resemble a ferris wheel spinning in the sky. Warrnambool, Victoria (West of Cape Orway), 9:00 p.m., Oct. 21: Two witnesses observed a light about 4 or 5 times the size of the evening star in the northeastern sky. The object was described as being orange-red in color and to be hovering at a height of 75 degrees. It remained stationary for several minutes, then suddenly changed color to yellow and moved rapidly to a 10 degree position in the southeast, where it hovered again for a few minutes before speeding away to the south. Blackwood, Victoria (Northeast of Cape Otway), 10:30 p.m., Oct. 21: Report by John Thompson: Mr. and Mrs. C. Rossito, Mr. and Mrs. R. Petersen, and Mr. and Mrs. G. Williams were at a holiday house in Blackwood. Mrs. Petersen together with the others were watching TV in the lounge room. The front of the room has large windows, out of which they observed an extremely bright light in the east. The light was bright as a spot light, with a small red light to the left and a smaller green light to the right. Mrs. Petersen noticed the object for a period of only 5 minutes through the window. It was at an azimuth of 20-25 degrees and made no sound. At this particular time the television began to malfunction. They were unable to control the picture rolling no matter how much they tried. At approximately 11:10 p.m., all three parties observed the object in a position of 90-95 degrees. Mrs. Petersen and Mrs. Rossito became quite fearful of the object now that it had stayed for so long and not changed position. Mrs. Williams was not affected. They all then watched the object for a period of 15 minutes. They all state that during the event the object hovered in one position then at times would appear to go up arid down, and side to side with a very rapid speed. They all state that the object was then emitting beams colored red/green in the form of a dotted line. The lines were directed to the earth's surface but disappeared seconds later. Each beam was estimated to be 100 feet long. Still awake, they observed that at approx. 1:30 a.m. the object had moved again to a position of 45 degrees still hovering. The object had changed shape to the form of a cricket bat, still white in color, then later into a long straight line, white • in color and quite thin. Mrs. Rossito observed this, then turned her head away for a second and the object was gone. Next morning, all members were in a cheerful mood. During the observation the kitchen and lounge globes blew out for no apparent reason. The TV was switched off early, due to its erratic behavior. Their horses in the back lot were more restless than nor- mal. After the incident, Mrs. Rossito was depressed and suffered watering eyes, aching ears, irritated nose, and a severe headache. The other two ladies felt normal, except that Mrs. Williams felt an extreme impulse that she should not leave the house that Sunday after- noon. She did not want to leave. VUFORS is in receipt of at least 50 good sighting reports made before, during, and after the event which occurred on that fateful day. Since investigation of these sightings requires many miles of travel over several hundred square miles of the area and since investigators must bear the full cost of these investigations out of their own pockets, several months may pass before a full report is possible and the extent and meaning of this series of incidents will be known, if ever."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Malaysia, Continued) The following alleged encounters, the full stories of which are incomplete since the principal witnesses cannot be located, are listed below. CASE 1. Johore Bahru, 1970 Four boys going to school one morning saw a small UFO and tiny 6- inch tall creatures. The boys soon reported it to the headmaster and since it occurred in the school premises, the news broke out and soon' the whole school were combing the area looking for the creatures. One small burnt patch on the ground was found. The UFO was gone. CASE 2: Gambang near Kuantan, 1973 Two schoolboys claimed to have seen tiny humanoids only 3-inches tall in the school compound. It is said that one of the creatures was actually .caught by the boys, which attracted the attention of a teacher. He arrived in time to see it before the tiny creature finally managed to escape. CASE 3: Bukit Mertajam, 1973 A group of boys playing football in a school field sighted a small UFO landed nearby. From it emerged tiny creatures which immediately one of the boys tried to catch. A beam of light was fired at the boy's hand. The UFO flew away. CASE 4: Ipoh, 1973 A small UFO carrying tiny humanoids landed in a school field. Several schoolboys who sighted it excitedly called their teachers. They came just too late to see the object speeding away. CASE 5: Miri, Sarawak, 1973 Several boys saw a humanoid about 6 inches tall wearing a white suit cutting a fence wire with an intense beam of light. They tried to catch it but it was lost in the bushes. No UFO was sighted. CASE 6: Miri, Sarawak, 1973 Several people on vacation along the beach sighted a group of tiny beings wearing white suits. There were about six or seven of them. They wore no mask and resembled humans except for their tiny size. This group consisted of possibly males and females. The females were notable because of the long hair. An attempt to catch them failed. No saucer was sighted. CASE 7: Bukit Mertajam, 1979 A small UFO landed on a field near some boys. A boy tried to catch a 3-inch creature that emerged from it. It fired a beam that temporarily paralyzed his right arm. The UFO then flew away. There were not less . than 7 reported landings in Malaysia from the first known landing in 1970 through May 1979. From these reports there were,5 cases of close encounter with tiny humanoids and 2 other cases reported, from East Malaysia but no UFO was sighted. The creatures measured, in all cases, either 3 inches or 6 inches tall. All were equipped with a type of ray gun. They were described as well dressed in one-piece suits. Some had slightly larger head and round eyes. The 3-inch humanoids sometimes had two antenna-like structures protruding' from the head. Case 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 occurred in West Malaysia, all reported by school children and all landings took place in school premises. There were 3 more probable encounters with tiny humanoids in Malaysia, but unfortunately the origin of the incidents cannot be traced. One recent case, a probable landing, occurred on May 26,1979, near Kulim where the witnesses, 3 boys and 2 adults, claimed to have sighted a small UFO hovering a few feet above the ground perhaps in an attempt to land since its three landing gears were already down. As the witnesses tried to touch the object an intense light ray shone into their eyes which temporarily blinded them. This shows that the small UFO was intelligently controlled from inside. Considering its small, size, estimated about 2 feet in diameter, the UFO occupants if any.inside would have to measure about 3 inches tall to fit comfortably in the object. Of the 9 reported landings or encounters with humanoids, 7 cases occurred in broad daylight. Only 2 landings were known to have taken place at night. There have been no reports of encounters with UFO occupants after dawn. Almost all of the UFOs sighted close range on the ground or hovering close to the ground measured on the average less than 3 feet in diameter.

He pressed the shutter with much presence of mind and thus obtained what may be the best snapshots ever taken of a UFO. The mysterious navigator is shaped like a hat and has three openings, presumably for observations. According to experts it is a \"flying saucer\" which may be manned or not. but depends on a \"mother ship\" which possibly finds itself over Argentina territory in an unknown mission. Cordoba (From our agency) - Luis Ferreyra, a local miner, was photographing a hummingbird flying between the foliage near the Los Molinos dam, Dept. of Calamuchita, when a UFO suddenly appeared in his viewfinder. The man, with great presence of mind, pressed the shutter several times and it is possible that the photographs obtained are the best and most valid as a document since the strange appearances began to be recorded the world over. The strange \"encounter\" occurred on the 5th of this month, but Ferreyra only handed the negatives to the afternoon paper \"Cordoba\" yesterday (to whose courtesy Clarin' owes their reproduction), which permitted the observation with exceptional fidelity, of the characteristics of a vehicle which could have come from the cosmos. Ferreyra said that around 0300 p.m. of the 5th, with a Minolta fitted with a 500mm lens, he was trying to follow the fast zigzag of a hummingbird against the sun, when unexpectedly a UFO entered his field of vision. Without hesitating, he took several snapshots, although he added the appearance had made him nervous. \"I cannot estimate the altitude at which the mysterious object was flying, which was of a metallic color. It suddenly tilted at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the earth and was silently lost in space. That was all.\" Upon consulting some students of the phenomena which throw mankind into conjectures, they explained that at first sight the photograph is authentic and the suspicion of a trick may be ruled out, although it will be necessary to study the negatives. . . . A detailed observation of the object photographed in the Los Molinos dam shows two small openings over the outer edge of the wing and another — circular — in the bottom. Morphologically, the craft resembles a hat and seems to have been built with opaque materials. The space traveler once again opens a discussion which, with this new testimony, assumes fascinating intensity. The obliged question is: What do UFOs want in the Argentine sky? One of the hypotheses already mentioned refers to the particular geographical position of our country, far away from places where an atomic holocaust might occur. But while conjectures abound, the remarkable quality of the photographs is eloquent in itself, as much as the story of the man who wanted to catch a hummingbird on film and ended up by capturing a flying saucer. IMFCSf^OAT (Malaysia, Continued) UFOs that were sighted in the air were usually of large size. There have been reports of a disc-shaped UFO as big as a house flying over the hilly country in East Malaysia and a long elliptical object like a neon light was also sighted high in the sky. UFO sightings near or within school compounds have been a worldwide occurrence. It is not surprising, therefore, that most of the Malaysian landings occurred in or near the school area. UFOs, as suspected by some researchers, have shown considerable interest in schools by the frequent sightings recorded. In Malaysia the case may not be so considering the nature of the land. From the air Malaysia offers half a dozen types of landing grounds, namely jungles, rubber and oil palm plantations, rice fields, tin-mining areas, and football fields. For a landing the thick jungles and rubber plantations do not offer enough clearance. Rice fields and tin-mining areas are almost isolated, and if there were any landings most would go unnoticed (considering also the small size of the UFO). The only landing spot that would attract attention in the event of a landing would be a field. Why do Malaysian encounters (the UFO and the humanoids) come only in tiny sizes when compared to other parts of the world? Why do most . landings occur in the daytime when all other worldwide landing reports usually happen at night? If deception is part of the UFO phenomenon then their tiny size may allow them to easily escape unnoticed. Since there have been no reports of encounters with bigger or human-size humanoids in the dark hours, then we again ask, why do most landings have to be conducted in the day time? It has been observed that UFOs were mainly attracted to the fracture- zone areas of high seismic activity. In fact it can be seen that earthquake-free areas or countries have fewer UFO reports compared to the bulk of the UFO sightings reported originating from earthquake zones or areas that have records of or have \"felt\" even the slightest earth tremors. Malaysia is an earthquake-free country. The areas of gravity and magnetic anomalies which UFOs may use to operate so excellently is lacking in this region. Is the tiny size a compensation for the maneuverability to land and take off on a magnetically stable area?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MISSOURI TRACE CASE FOLLOW-UP By Ted Phillips (The original report appeared in MUFON UFO Journal No. 135, May 1979.) I have waited to submit my report only because I had hoped to have analysis results.

The only objection I have to the published report is the mention of \"tripod circles\" which is somewhat misleading. In the soil profile there was no indication of any depressions in the site. Compression tests were made in two of the areas and there was no indication of weight. The three areas mentioned were somewhat drier and were barren but nothing to indicate landing imprints. When I arrived at the site I took 31 color photographs and 19 color slides of the landing site and surrounding area. A number of photographs were taken of the site from various directions showing the grid in place. A transit was used to lay off a grid with 1-foot square increments. The site was then measured and sketched and the additional photographs taken. The transit was then used to take a soil profile across the site N - S and W - E.

The testimony was obtained by police of the IV Regional Unit when it was on a routine patrol in its jurisdiction. In Bigand, Pedro Celotto reported that in his field located to the west of an urban area, a UFO had landed on a soybean plantation. Once there, police could verify that a certain area of the plantation was burned in a circle of some 8 meters diameter. On being questioned, some residents said that early last Saturday a luminous object started to move in the sky. Some claimed that several cars along National Route 33 had their engines stopped without any apparent reason. A relative of Celotto said he had seen an \"intense light that blinded me\" a few minutes prior to the alleged landing. Earth samples and calcinated grass were taken from the spot and sent to Rosario for analysis. It is expected that results will throw some light on this event, which is the cause of excited comments in an extensive area of the Caseros department.

The \"Daily Bulletin\" of Legaspi, in the province of Albay 352km to the SE of this capital says the residents flowed into the streets to see the object and marveled at the range of colors from the flash it gave off, until it disappeared. The paper says the manager of a radio station reported the craft had an \"extraterrestrial bright- ness\" and that if projected in the perspective, it had the size of an adult's fist. This is the second time a UFO was seen in the Philippines in one week. Last Sunday an American scientist said that he and hundreds of villagers saw a UFO fly over the area near the highest peak of the Philippines. That UFO seemed to have two unfolded antennas and the scientist said he saw it through his binoculars and that he thought he saw figures moving inside. According to observers, these figures had a human or humanoid shape. At a given time it seemed as if they were greeting people through the portholes with their hands, \"very similar to small octopus tentacles,\" claimed the flustered neighbors.

Bryant NO UFORESIGHT IN CONGRESS If you're unhappy about the Federal Government's handling (or mishandling) of its role in UFOlogy, all you have to do is make your views known to your elected representative, right? Wrong. Expecting your congressman to take any positive action toward resolving the UFO. controversy is like expecting him and his colleagues to produce a practical, timely solution for the nation's energy problem. True, a few individual represent- atives and senators in times past have shown some inclination to take a close look at the subject. Once, in fact, the House held a so-so hearing (1968) to tap the scientific community's interest. But by and large, no congressional member (or body of members) wants to get his hands messy over such a politically explosive issue as UFOlogy. Where does this leave the average citizen who would welcome more candor, more verifiable information on. the continuing role of the Executive Branch in UFO research? Aside from efforts of privately funded UFO research groups and the even less regular product of those investigative reporters who dare brave the murky depths of the UFO vortex, your average .citizen has little to gain by putting the UFO question up for con- gressional scrutiny. This sad state of governmental responsiveness to a genuinely perplexing social and technological phenomenon is reflected in the recent inability of two Virginia solons — Sen. Harry F. Byrd, Jr., and Rep. Joseph L. Fisher — to give any more than lip service to the need for compelling the Central Intelligence Agency to cut the cagyness and deliver the delicacies. Oh, they'll give you a fairly prompt reply to your letter requesting their intercession, but they draw the line at any proposed action beyond their service as a correspondence \"tickler.\" . . . Thank you for writing, dear citizen. We appreciate hearing your views. (And, between the lines, please remember us in November.) What can be done about this all- too-typical apathy? Not much, except maybe once in a while publicizing it in the pages of the UFO press. Meantime, until a congressman or a member of his immediate family is abducted by UFOnauts, or until the body of \"hard evidence\" now being sought by certain private researchers materializes with a bang, Congress might just as well be written off as a waste of time and effort on the part of any UFO-oriented citizen who seeks its guidance or assistance. On the other hand, at the slim prospect that the Rip van Winkles on Capitol Hill will be roused by an outraged citizenry, MUFON stands ready to relay, in the pages of this journal, your concern about their apathy. If you do decide to contact your congressman about a specific UFO incident or about the UFO fiasco of the Executive Branch or about the future of general UFO research; and if you do receive more than a form-letter reply, by all ; means keep us informed. We're planning to do a comprehensive study of congressional interest in UFOlogy, and we'd be pleased to receive any documentation bearing on the subject. We hope to summarize the results of this study in a later installment of this column. CITIZENS' ACCESS TO NSA RECORDS SUFFERS SETBACK On October 29, 1979, a three- judge Federal appeals court ruled unanimously in a freedom-of- information case that records of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) generally are so sensitive to the status quo of \"national security\" that they can be afforded special dispensation from the scrutiny of any adversary action pursued under terms of the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. What does this portend for those of us intent on using the FIA to ferret from NSA closets a well of thus-far undisclosed UFO data? Well, if the appeals court decision is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, we can expect to see that well dry up before our very eyes. For what the decision does is to deny FIA requestors the right to have a Federal District Court judge inspect contested records to determine if they truly represent what the agency says they do in terms of any potential threat to national security that their full release might pose. It's perfectly permissible, according to the decision, for the judge to accept at face value the swom-in- secret protestations of agency officials that a contested record must remain unreleasable if court ordered release, in the officials' opinion, could endanger the security of the United States. The plaintiff in such a case, without-being able to review (or have the court review) the records, now must prove to the court's satisfaction that their release would not endanger national security. In other words, the onus is on the requestor, not the agency, to convince the court that the records' release would be in the public interest. One hopes that the plaintiffs in this cruicial case will press their appeal. Meantime, you can bet that any effort to compel the National Security Agency to release its withheld UFO records will be met with renewed resistance.

(Reviewed by David K. Hackett, Director of ORION, and Richard Hall) .. As we begin the fourth decade of the UFO mystery, we : find the controversy has changed little. Thousands of. UFO books have been published; alleged factual accounts, debunking analyses, and religious and cult texts. Virtually every book in print has-had one'goal: to convince the reader that its premises hold the valid truths on UFOs. With all that \"truth\" in print,. why do we still have a UFO mystery? . The phenomenon is an emotional one,.and many people want to believe despite the facts. The years of study have shown that most (85-90%) UFQs are misidentified or misperceived natural or man-made events.: It has been very. time- consuming to sift through these reports. Allan Hendry's new book is designed to help the reader identify these sightings, and free the ufologist to devote more time to the 10-15% of the sightings that may hold.the key to the mystery; or that may perhaps prove to be more complex misperceptions. . The. UFO Handbook, then, is not another UFO. reader full of juicy, incredible stories. It is a text book, designed to help people explain what they are misperceiving and distinguish UFOs from IFOs. Excellent photographs combined with a text that concisely explains what 30 years of UFO research, and l l / 2 years of Mr. Hendry's -intensive research, has .discovered. While neither this book or any other book is likely to lay the UFO question to rest, at least some rational illumination is shed on this dark corner of our culture. Do not expect platitudes designed to please the avid UFO reader or to sell the book. This book is not likely to garner priase from UFO hobbyists and supporters of \"pet theories,\" because it is brutally frank in its assessment of the competence of witnesses and investigators alike. However, it is 14 destined to become the premier text on the UFO phenomena. Mr. Hendry uses to excellent advantage his investigations to point out the proper and thorough way to handle sightings. There are many lessons to be learned from the Identified Flying Objects. His drought of speculation is much appreciated with respect to the monsoon of hypotheses being pushed elsewhere. His one chapter on speculation reveals him to lean toward a Jungian hypothesis, which provides a great working latitude for a skeptically curious investigator! The chapter on tools of the trade is a most valuable layman's guide to these oft misunderstood tools. As he rhetorically queries, why, after 30 years, have I had to amass these resource lists. But it is a sign of the times and the public's changed attitude that Mr. Hendry is one of the first to be able to devote full time to UFO research. There may be no more to UFOs than misperceptions, hysteria, and a powerful desire to believe, but regardless, our ignorance must be confronted, and this book does it squarely, and head on. Perhaps the next 30 • years will see the mystery solved. Towards that end, this text cannot help but be of use to \"ufologists\" of all bents, and I recommend it highly.- David K. Hackett The UFO Handbook encompass- es under one cover information about practically every stimulus that can (and, unfortunately, often does) cause a false UFO report by unsophisticated observers. In that respect, it is a valuable compilation both for the general public and for the amateur investigator. Mr. Hendry rightly stresses the generally poor quality investigation work done by well- meaning \"ufologists,\" and he advocates careful and thorough investigation, providing many useful suggestions to that end. His section on \"tools\" for investigators is good and highly appropriate. All this is to his credit. The other side of the coin is that those of us with considerably more experience will find little that is new and will have covered this ground long ago. In fact, at NICAP in the 1960's we kept logs of IFO possibilities and routinely checked such things as advertising planes. Also, descriptions of common IFOs have appeared in the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual since 1975. More bothersome to many- \"veterans\" is the fact that Mr. Hendry has spent so much time and effort only to rediscover (as has been well- established for years) that most reports become IFOs. By now it should be clear that the real problem for science, if any, lies in the well-articulated, high strangeness UFOs. Why hasn't the Center for UFO Studies used its precious resources to delve into the hard-core cases instead of dwelling on IFOs? To some extent, this criticism may be unjust, because it is all too true that low-grade reports (and amateurish investigation) have obscured serious evidence all along, and the IFO problem will not go away. This will undoubtedly be the definitive work on IFOs, and on methods of investigation in general. The codification of IFOlogy for a general audience clearly is worthwhile. Mr. Hendry implies that careless and inexpert investigators are responsible for allowing many explainable reports to masquerade as UFOs in the published literature. Indeed, his criticisms of \"ufologists\" are harsh to an extreme (incidentally tarring all of us with a broad brush). The book strongly challenges \"Ufologists\" and exhorts them to clean up their act.

Now, a few weeks ago, another bright soul sped her way toward eternity. She was not known to the UFO research field, but because she was generous, wise, and loving, she contributed to the wisdom of many. Her passing points up a cogent fact which we should understand and remember — that there are numerous persons oh this earth who, although not involved in our field, are nevertheless contributing toward our gradual comprehension of what UFOs 'might be. The question of UFOs is not the province of investigators and scientists alone. They are everyone's problem. Fifty-seven percent of the American population are now convinced that UFOs exist, and the percentage climbs higher each year. There must be some overwhelming reason why the subject of UFOs is important to the majority of people. More and more researchers are beginning to suspect that UFOs might be inextricably linked with ' the continuing evolution of the human species. Mary Terri Taylor was a radio and TV writer for many years and also, for two decades, taught film writing to hundreds of students of varying degrees of ability in the Hollywood (California) High adult education program. After retiring, she continued for ten more years participating as tutor and guide in private writing workshops. Under her instruction, many budding writers emerged into the mainstream of Hollywood's entertainment industries. Mary, being wise, was a special person. Her mind was always open to new ideas. A staunch Christian Scientist, she nevertheless opened her , heart to people whose lifestyles were vastly different from her own — and to a certain UFO researcher who brought to her class ideas for scripts ranging from time travel to intradimensional visitations. All ideas were, to Mary, worthy of consideration, not only as vehicles for visual entertainment, but also as carriers for man's eternal preoccupation with his own nature and the reasons for his existence. When she left us, Mary was a fresh- faced septuagenarian whose snowy white hair was always coiffed in charming curls, setting off her Irish blue eyes and smiling pink cheeks. A tiny, compact person, her clothes fitted her personality — bright, modern, and attractive. She was the very embodiment of a cheerful, giving soul. I remember her best, however, as a pseudo-stern, demanding teacher -who was satisfied only when her students gave her their best efforts. No episode in our association together pointed up these qualities better than our work together on a UFO screenplay entitled \"The Red Hand of the O'Neills.\" When . I first wrote the screenplay, I entitled it \"The Trouble with an Irishman.\" Its main character was a scientist of Irish ancestry who was struggling alone with the knowledge that UFOs were malicious travelers from man's future. The man was full of troubles, for all the factions of society he attempted to alert — colleagues, local authorities, government officials, even family and friends — none believed him. In the first aspects of his \"trouble,\" the plot elements were probably pure science fiction, but in the second, his troubles were all too real, as any UFO researcher can testify. Mary did not differentiate between . the science fiction elements and those parts of the plot which were more true to life. All the plot elements seemed, to her, to blend into a \"good story.\" I do not know to this day whether she was privately convinced that UFOs were real; she encouraged me nonetheless. She helped me mold the filmplay into the tightest, most dramatic form possible and afterward contributed her strength and personal contacts toward marketing it. Now, several weeks after her death, it seems her efforts were not in vain, for the script is now in the hands of a capable Hollywood agent who understands and values the ufological elements of its plot. : Mary did not concern herself with the intricacies of UFO research. Yet she generously gave of her time and talent in this particular project. Why? Perhaps she instinctively realized that the subject matter, even though in dramatic form, u;as important. If it fired the imagination and determination of one of her students to spend a year writing the \"Red Hand of the O'Neills,\" did she, perhaps, begin to think that the subject was not merely wild fancy? Mary, therefore, represents an essential cross section of humanity whose help we researchers desperately need. Scientists cannot solve the UFO problem alone. They must necessarily depend on the backing of large elements of the population whose interest in the subject might at best be peripheral and unclear, but nevertheless intense. There are several reasons why this is so. The first reason is our desperate need for funding. Monies will not come from dogmatic, official science. Their world view is simply not yet able to accept UFOs. Funding will not come either from government channels, those few functionaries who possess proof that UFOs exist cling possessively to their imperfect knowledge. They will not make it public because they cannot bear the thought (continued on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"UFO INVESTIGATION CAN HAMS HELP? By David L. Dobbs, K8NQN You bet they can! Amateur radio operators and UFO investigators go together like ham and eggs. A few investigators are hams, of course. But you'd be surprised at how many amateurs are interested in UFOs. The MUFON UFO nets are a vital part of the organization's activities. Net members are privy to a great deal of information which never reaches the rest of you, and we're going to do something about that. But how can radio amateurs help you as an investigator? By communicating, of course. Long distance contacts on the low (short wave) bands are far from the most useful means. In the larger cities and many smaller ones, repeaters operating in the two meter FM amateur radio band make it possible for hams in cars, open areas, or walking the dog to communicate with others over a multi- county area. With their hand-held transceivers, they can access the telephone network through autopatch capability, or contact someone to do this for them. The implications for sighting, tracking, and reporting UFOs is obvious. At any hour of the day or night, a large number of potential witnesses can be alerted in seconds, and investigators called in while an event is still in progress. Some of the repeater groups in larger cities number 500 or more, and at any one time a considerable number will be listening. OK, you're sold on the usefulness of ham radio liaison, but you don't know an amateur radio operator. How do you contact one who is interested in UFOs and willing to cooperate with you? There are lots of ways, easier for those who live in cities. But persistent inquiry will no doubt turn up a willing ham in almost any part of the country, or the world for that matter. • License plates. In almost every state, amateur radio operators have 16 special plates listing their call letters. These will be from four to six characters with a single number denoting the call area in the middle. Some examples: N1JS, WONC, K8NQN, WA3QLW. There may or may not be a special antenna on the car. If you see one of these fellows in a parking lot or drive past his home, strike up a conversation. Even if he or she isn't interested in UFOs, they probably know another ham who is. • Antennas. Look for towers in backyards carrying large beams having several horizontal members. Distinguish these from CB antennas, which may have only two vertical members or an umbrella shape. Ask the owner or neighbors about it and introduce yourself to the ham. • Radio clubs. Watch for announcements of radio club meetings, classes or hamfests in your area, where you can meet large numbers of amateur operators. There may be a ham column in your city paper, or a ham who is mentioned in an article. Radio clubs are always looking for speakers, and would welcome a talk on UFOs. This could bring you many new and helpful friends in a hurry. • Public events. Look for hams with their handhelds at parades and other events where they often coordinate efforts and provide communications. Show some interest, and then bring up your UFO work. • Listen on 144-146 MHz. If you have a radio which covers the public service bands, listen carefully on these frequencies for two meter FM repeaters or simplex transmissions, the hams will be in your city or area, and can be tracked down from their call letters by consulting a Callbook in a local radio store. • Ask TV repairmen and electronic technicians if they are hams or know a (continued on next page) (California Report, Continued) that the \"people\" will think them imperfect, too. Funding, when it comes, will most likely emerge from groups in the general population whose thinking is less rigid than scientists and whose minds, unlike officialdom, are less afraid to accept the unknown. Secondly, the purpose of UFOs. does not seem to be directed toward changing science's world paradigm. Instead, their purpose seems to be to open up a larger view of the essential nature of man. UFOs seem to be teaching the human race what lies ahead in the future for us all. Mary Terri Taylor took the time to help a floundering student develop an idea about UFOs into professional screenplay form. Multiplied thousands of times over, it is individuals like Mary who help -other investigators and scientists in many other ways. Behind each researcher stand numerous persons not intimately connected with the subject per se, but who support and encourage them. These unknown persons are making a vast contribution toward understanding the nature of UFOs. When the answer finally comes, it will be a triumph not only for the investigators and scientists but for the entire human race. The Fund for UFO Re- search, Box 277, Mt. Rainier, MD 20822 has obtained tax exempt status by a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service dated 26 November 1979. This ruling clears the way for American citizens to contribute money to support specific UFO research projects and to deduct the contributions from their Federal income tax. Proposals from members of UFO groups — or anyone else — will be evaluated by a National and International Board, and grants will be made to support specific research projects that show promise of advancing public knowledge and under- standing of UFO phenomena."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"(Hams, Continued) ham. Radio and TV engineers are ',• frequently hams. Call your local . stations and ask. Policemen usually know of local hams as we'll, or one may maintain their communication equipment. This list of suggestions is by no means exhaustive. Use your ingenuity. During a local flap, CB operators can also be of great assistance. There are REACT or emergency coordination groups in most areas who can mobilize a large number of local people in a hurry, or access the telephone via a base station when necessary. The potentialities of two meter amateur radio repeaters will enable a ham friend to be of much greater value to you, however. Through the MUFON nets, he can monitor and exchange current information about UFO sightings, publications and developments your group would otherwise not know about. He need not necessarily be a MUFON member to provide such a service. So if you're not a ham, and not interested in amateur radio, don't be turned off by it. You can make use of it, and it can help you. This is by way of introduction to NET NEWS, a MUFON UFO Journal feature which will attempt to bring you the latest UFO information being discussed on the nets. I think ' you'll be interested. So don'tjbypass the column because of the title and the bunch of figures at the top. Read on. You may be surprised enough to go out and find a ham to work with. NET NEWS MUFON AMATEUR RADIO NETS: SATURDAY 7237KHz 0800 EDT/EST NIJS 3975 KHz 0800 CDT/CST WA9ARG What happened to the 15 meter international UFO net which, was publicized this summer? Dr. Hynek himself heralded it in' the August issue of the Internationa! UFO Reporter. Supposedly meeting on 21.375 MHz at 0200 UTC, the net was to facilitate rapid transfer of information on UFO sightings between countries. Yet members of MUFON and other UFO nets have monitored the frequency and called on it week after week to no avail. Attempts to contact the ham cited as net control in a Florida publication have proven fruitless. If there is such a net, we're not aware of it. Efforts to resolve the problem are continuing. We'll keep you informed here. Meanwhile, at least two other nets not affiliated with MUFON are known to be thriving. A two meter UFO net is active on 144.250 MHz SSB Friday evenings at 0000 UTC. The time will not change with Daylight Savings. WA3QLW and WA3BIB report coverage throughout the Harrisburg, Pa, area including York, Lancaster, and as far east as Baltimore at times. Both control operators are regulars on the MFUON 40 meter net. A ten meter net has been active for a year now on 28.8 MHz (alternate 27.795) on Thursday evenings at 0100 UTC, also regardless of Daylight Savings. This is the Cincinnati Area UFO Net. Net control is KA8BVO, with K8NQN assisting and providing liaison with the 40 meter section of the MUFON net. . Beginning January 5, the Cincinnati Area UFO Net will convene an afternoon section on Saturdays to extend coverage to the Southwest and western states. Listen on or about 28.8 MHz at 2000 UTC. We'll give it a try during January and see what happens. There is great need for a west coast .MUFON net and liaison with the existing central and east coast sections. Perhaps a 40 meter section could be organized in the west, with liaison later in the day through stations in the central part of the country. Be thinking about it. The existing MUFON nets serve the eastern and central parts of the U.S. fairly well. NIJS, Joe Santangelo of The Andreasson Affair fame, guides information exchange 'from Maine and North Carolina west to-Michigan and Missouri on the 40 meter section. WONC, Bill Armstrong, has to get up early to make the net at 7 AM on Saturday mornings in St. Louis. For the rest of us, it's not quite so early. He also acts as liaison with the 75 meter section which convenes an hour later. WA9ARG, Marshall Coins in Quincy, Illinois, takes care of an area from Illinois and Missouri as far west as Oklahoma. In the winter time, Ohio stations find it possible to check in. New members are welcome in both nets. But west to the Rockies and beyond, nothing. CQ out there! WA5CTJ in Texas can sometimes make the 40 meter section, but how are we going to find out about the big flap or crash in the southwestern states or along the Pacific Coast? Readership assistance is solicited in obtaining more information on two important subjects recently discussed on the MUFON nets: The first is an unsubstantiated rumor, but a fascinating one. Net control for the Cincinnati Area UFO Net met a local college student from Columbia who wanted to contact his (continued on page 19) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"(Director's Message, Continued) Today and Tomorrow.\" The featured speaker was Dr. Leo Sprinkle, Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Wyoming. Dr. Sprinkle related how hypnotism could be used in UFO cases, a similar presentation to the one he delivered at the International Conference on UFOs held in London, England, in September. This meeting was designed as an important step in the revitalization of an effective reporting and investigative network for Colorado. Vance Reed of Northglenn was introduced as the new Assistant State Director for Colorado: Vance may be contacted by telephone at (303) 452- 1246 and Bob Spencer at (303) 279-4682. This was the occasion to issue their first MUFON Colorado Newsletter. \"UFO Phenomena and the Behavioral Scientist,\" a new book edited by Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., has just been released by Scarescrow Press, Inc., 52 Liberty St., P.O. Box 656, Metuchen, NJ 08840. Depite the fact that UFOs have been with us for many years and seem to be of more than passing interest to increasing numbers of people, relatively few professional scientists have taken time to comment on the wide variety of phenomena associated with UFOs. It is believed that this is the first book devoted to this very purpose. Psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, a psychiatrist, and a parapsychologist have contributed authoritative, scientific appraisals of numerous, phenomena associated with UFOs. This hardback book contains 464 pages, numerous illustrations, and is priced at $18.50. Dick Haines was a festured speaker at MUFON's recent symposium in Burlingame, Calif.. It is with the utmost sympathy that we acknowledge the passing on August 30 of Virgina Planz, the wife of our Alabama State Director, Ed Planz. On the more joyful side, may we extend our congratulations and best wishes to Carol Janet Walker and Forrest R. Lundberg who were married on October 27,1979, in Des Moines, Iowa. Forrest is the State Director for Iowa and served as the Chairman for the 1975 MUFON UFO Symposium. The October 16th issue of the Kansas City Times featured an article and photograph of George Eberhart, MUFON Staff Librarian, under the heading \"Now That's Weird.\" The story touched upon a few of the 100,000 strange happenings that are related in George's forthcoming 1,100 page book to be published by Greenwood Press of Westport, Conn., in 1980. Titled \"Anamolies,\" the book will become the first comprehensive bibliography of published accounts of mysterious events, conditions, behaviors, and discoveries in North America. Mr. Eberhart is a reference librarian at the University of Kansas School of Law. An article \"Preserving the UFO Literature — A .Status Report\" by William E. Jones, MUFON Field Investigator, will soon be published in the MFUON UFO Journal. Bill has outlined his work and the positive steps that have been taken to interest major university libraries in establishing collections of UFO material to be stored in an area of limited access and used on a non-circulating basis. Since this is a project sponsored by the Mutual UFO Network, participating libraries will receive a complimentary subscription to the MUFON UFO Journal and all symposium proceedings from 1975 through 1979. Seven libraries have already expressed their interest and desire to preserve the literature of one of the most fascinating and challenging aspects of our history — the search for the meaning of the UFO. Jacques Vallee can now say \"I told you so.\" I personally do not have to apologize, because this message (not an editorial) depicts the superb work being done by volunteers around the world and is recognition for their accomplishments in UFOlogy. UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO. reports (i.ei, little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields.\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to:  ' ' UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 • Plumerville, Arkansas 72127 REPORT ON \"RETRIEVALS\" MUFON plans to publish a monograph by Leonard H. Stringfield reporting the latest information from various informants about alleged retrievals of crashed UFOs and small humanoid bodies. Stringfield first reported publicly on these claims at the Dayton, Ohio, ' MUFON UFO Symposium in 1978, and promised to contribute a follow-up article to the • Journal as more information was obtained. Despite the offer of a large sum of money from a well-known publication if he would reveal some of his sources, Stringfield not only has kept his promise but also has refused to compromise his sources in any way. So much new information has been obtained that MUFON has decided on a separate publication to do the material justice. Details will be announced. 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish In Others' Words Are there real \"star wars\" taking place in outer space? According to an article in the September 25 NATIONAL ENQUIRER, the mysterious explosions in deep space which have been detected by various satellites may well represent intergalactic warefare of some sort. The October 9 issue presented a summary of the incident in which Minnesota deputy sheriff Val Johnson was stunned by a low-flying UFO. the different types of reported UFO occupants are detailed in the October 16 issue, based on the research conducted by'MUFON's Humanoid Study Group. Former astronaut Deke Slay ton tells of his 1951 encounter with a UFO in the October 23 issue. THE STAR for October 2 presents additional information on the Minnesota deputy's UFO experience and tells of other happenings in the western portion of that state. BEYOND REALITY'S \"UFO Special Issue\" (not to be confused with the quarterly UFO UPDATE from the same publisher) is nothing more than reprints of articles appearing in past issues of BEYOND REALITY. It will apparently be published on an annual basis at $2.00 per copy. James Oberg's \"UFO Update\" column in the October issue of OMNI rehashes the 1908 Siberian explosion of whatever-it-was. Oberg, of course, favors a natural explanation for the event, quoting various \"experts\" who suggest the object in question was a small comet. Those pundits who loudly proclaim that life on the other planets of our solar system has been shown to be an impossibility should take the time to read David Chandler's LIFE ON MARS before continuing their negative pronouncements. Chandler's book contains no information on UFOs, but in his analysis of the results obtained from the Viking landers, the author concludes that \"most people are not aware of how close we are to the proof of life on Mars.\" Not only might there be micro-organisms and plant life on Mars, but Chandler's examination of such things as the \"Pyramids of Elysium\" show that intelligent (and, apparently, highly-advanced) lifeforms may have existed there at one time. If so, there might well be significant implications for UFO research. For an excellent summary of what we now know about Mars and what we might find when manned expeditions land there, LIFE ON MARS is highly recommended. The price is $9.95 from E.P. Dutton, 2 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016. According to compiler/editor Ronald Story, Doubleday's long- awaited project, THE ENCYCLO- PEDIA OF UFOs, is now set for publication in June 1980. It will be a large volume of around 500 pages, selling for about $25.00 in hardcover and $12.95 in paperback. Additional details will be presented in future columns. Story is now working on another book, UFOs AND THE LIMITS OF SCIENCE, to be published by William Morrow in 1980. This will be a presentation of the \"best\" UFO cases, as selected by various researchers. (Hams, Continued) father there. Learning of his interest in UFOs, the young man told him of an area in his country which was guarded by American soldiers. Local citizens are angry because, they are denied access to part of their country by foreign troops, the student said. Located about 100 miles south of Bogota in an isolated region, it is known as Sierra Dela Macarena. And what is being guarded there? The people all believe it is a UFO! So says the student. Hams contacting Columbia are asked to investigate this rumor. Perhaps MUFON's South American represent- atives can shed some light on the matter. We are also researching the UFO movies which were shown to radar specialists in various branches of the military service during the 1950's. Investigators who are able to provide further information on this subject are asked to forward it to the author. Leonard Stringfield now has three confirmations of such a movie and we are seeking more. Former radar specialists are likely to have become hams. And a late flash to update the Minnesota incident in which a UFO apparently smashed the windshield and headlight of a police car on August 27. Through WONC, we learned that the Ford Motor Company is piecing the broken glass together arid also has the bent antennas. John Schuessler told Dr. Armstrong that Ford is cooperating closely with Allan Hendry of CUFOS in the investigation. . The lull in sightings and landings evident throughout the summer continues. None were reported on the 40 meter net on October 6. One Bigfoot report was relayed, in which footprints and a thumbprint were said to have been collected in Danville, Michigan, in September. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by WaltAndrus Jacques Vallee may have made reference to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL in the book 'The Edge of Reality,\" which he co-authored with J. Allen Hynek when he made the following comment on page 223: \"So if you buy the typical bulletin of one of those groups, you will have a two-page editorial that says Mr. Such-and-Such resigned; Mrs. So-and-So's knees aren't getting any better (club news); So-and-So gave a lecture and it was enthusiastically reported in the Morning Star Register; and we're making great progress.\" The Director's Message may vary from an editorial on the scientific techniques for improving the study of UFOlogy to \"news around the network.\" This month's message may confirm Mr. Vallee's evaluation. Jacques may be critical of the UFO organizations, but he fails to take into consideration that a dedicated group of volunteers can accomplish far more in a shorter period of time that he can as an individual. If it wasn't for the UFO reports that researchers worldwide have shared with Mr. Vallee, he wouldn't have a computerized catalog today. In retrospect, Jacques ac- knowledges the fine work of Vicente- Juan Ballester Olmos on page 79 sharing his catalog of close encounters with UFOs in the Iberian Peninsula. We would like to echo Mr. Vallee's sentiments as it concerns the serious work being done by Mr. Ballester, as we announce his appointment as the Representative for Spain working with Pedro Redon-Trabal. Vicente's mailing address is Guardia Civil, 9, Derecha- 16a, Valencia-10 Spain. Vicente has served as a Research Specialist to MUFON for several years, but now will take on a more active role representing his nation. It is a pleasure to welcome one of the foremost UFO researchers of Europe into our midst. V.-J.

Wood as he assisted David Crockett in the showing of the New Zealand film and David's videotape documentary. \"Rocky\" has accepted the invitation of Harold H. Fulton and your International Director to become the North Island Sectional Director for New Zealand. Mr. Wood resides at 53 Jubilee Road, Khandallah, Wellington, New Zealand. Tennessee State Director, David K. Hackett, has selected his wife Nancy to fill his former position as State Section Director for Knox, Anderson, Roane, Loudon, Blount, Campbell, and Morgan Counties. They both serve as officers in ORION, the Oak Ridge Isochronous Observation Network. Nancy and David reside at 6500 Trousdale Road, Knoxville, TN 37921. Alfred D. Smith, Route 2, Box 305, Whiteville, NC 28472, has been appointed State Section Director for the North Carolina counties of Columbus, Brunswick, and Bladen by George D. Fawcett. September 18, 1979, marked the lecture by John F. Schuessler titled \"The Houston UFO Connection,\" as a fund-raising event for the students of Prairie View A & M University by the employees of McDonnell Douglas Technical Services Company. The funds raised will.be used by the students in an official space experiment designed to evaluate the vegetable plant seeds sprouting in space aboard the NASA Space Shuttle. The meeting was held at the spacious Clear Lake High School auditorium, where the 1980 MUFON UFO Symposium will convene. Project Starlight International sponsored a lecture by Dr. Bruce Maccabee in Austin, Texas, on October 5, 1979, in which our State Director for Maryland detailed his 3- week investigation in Australia and New Zealand on the famous New Zealand motion picture film. Ray Stanford, Director of P.S.I, and MUFON State Section Director, took this opportunity to announce the establishment of a UFO reporting \"hotline\" for the Austin, Texas, area (458-2031).
