The difference between most encounters that achieve acclaim and those failing to can usually be found in the degree of investigative attention. An \"ordinary\" anecdotal UFO report can be rendered sig- nificant through dedicated follow-up to eliminate mundane possibilities. Conversely, a seemingly un- deniable event may lose significance if the field in- vestigator simply records the witness account and fails to make the necessary collateral contacts. In this series, we will examine recent events evalu- ated as significant for UFO research, due primarily to the efforts of local MUFON members. The first installment concerns a tradesman residing some twenty miles southwest of our nation's capital. The event From the steps of his townhouse outside Alexan- dria, VA, a carpenter caught sight of an inky black spot approaching quickly from the WNW, the direc- tion of Dulles Airport. [Reagan-National Airport lies NE, while Fort Belvoir Military Reservation begins a few miles to the south.] It was 7:50 p.m., Sept. 9, 1999, with the sky still bright over ensuing dusk. The witness first thought he was observing a bird, but over the next second or so it doubled in apparent size, its shape resembling a mushroom cap with fuzzy edges. As it continued to approach on a straight-line path ESE, the object repeatedly tilted from side to side. These attitudinal changes revealed a black me- tallic underside segmented into six \"pie slices.\" The disc's border was a bluish silver metal, while black \"mist\" shrouded the upper portion. From each \"pie slice\" segment on the bottom shone an \"incredibly pure\" white light from which a white \"tube of light\" projected ten feet or so. These tubes ended abruptly in midair and with no outward spread- ing or diffusion one would expect from a light beam. In the next several seconds the object moved al- most directly overhead on its uninterrupted path. Drawing on the skills of his trade, and using the di- mensions of his own building as a guide, the witness estimated the anomaly to be approximately 100 feet in diameter and 500-700 feet aloft. He could not de- tect any sound from the object. At this point he ran inside to alert his wife and re- trieve their video camera. Upon his return outside a moment later, however, nothing out of the ordinary could be seen. He had viewed the object for probably no more than ten seconds. The witness experienced a strong sense of uneasi- ness immediately afterward, so strong in fact that he convinced his wife to pack a bag and drive with him to a distant motel for the night. The next morning while showering, he noticed a sun- burn-like redness on his chest, shoulders, and abdomen, though he had worn a colored t-shirt the previous day, including the moment of the sighting. [His face, neck and back were unaffected.] The discoloration was gone a day or so later. The investigation The witness was interviewed twice, remaining con- sistent and logical in his description and positive as to what he had seen. Through the course often years at the same residence, he had become very familiar with all manner of conventional aircraft passing nearby. His wife was interviewed separately. She had been on the telephone when he rushed in and did not join him outside. However, she related a few important points: Her spouse had seemed almost in shock when he ran in to tell her. She confirmed his insistence on leaving the area for the night, and she recalled that his \"sunburn\" the next day was quite prominent. One possible prosaic explanation for the event would involve a gross misidentification of a weather balloon. Field Investigator Joan Woodward contacted the Na- tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A spokesman there revealed that such bal- loons are launched daily at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. from Dulles Airport (i.e., in line with the approach of the object in question). He described them as tan in color with an orange parachute and no attached lights. Further, he es- timated that the evening balloon would have been at least 25,000 feet high by 7:50 p.m. Surface winds at 7 p.m. on Sept. 9 were stated as light. For these reasons, a balloon-based IFO explanation can be discounted. Ms. Woodward submitted an FOIA request to Fort Belvoir for flight activity, but that request was ignored. Undaunted, she telephoned the base and spoke with a public information officer, who indicated that nothing was launched on that day and that air traffic control records showed nothing unusual in the area.

Alfredo Lissoni National UFO Center, Italy On Dec. 9, 1954 a farmer, Giovanni Aquilante, Caserta, disappeared after he left home to go work in the fields. His family began to look for him, and the police were informed. But it was impossibile to find him. On the next day (Dec. 10,1954), toward midnight, Sighting near capital... (Continued from Page 3) Relatedly, investigator Woodward requested and obtained the air traffic control tower log from Reagan- National Airport. It too had nothing of interest in the vicinity that evening. [Note: An object moving at 500 feet or so from the ground would likely be below the floor of Reagan-National's radar.] In that alien spacecraft have never cooperated with FAA regulations by placing a transponder onboard, and because they tend to remain below the radar floors of major airports, an investigator should be greatly surprised if a control tower does indicate an anoma- lous radar return. Rather, the primary purpose for contacting airport and military base staff is to deter- mine whether a conventional aircraft was nearby at the critical moment and should have been recognized as such by the witness. This, then, is a fundamental step in the process of elimination prior to reaching a UFO conclusion, a step which Joan Woodward showed persistence in performing. Additional factors Because of intense construction in the general area of the witness' residence, electrical disturbances had not been uncommon. On this evening, however, lights in the townhouse continuously flickered and dimmed. Curiously, the next day the couple discovered that every battery in the household was dead, including those to their watches and cell phone. After a level of trust had been established, the wit- ness confided that as a child he frequently woke up in the night outside his home, sometimes still on the family's property, but on other occasions along a nearby road or river. To his knowledge, though, the September 1999 event was his first encounter with an unconventional vehicle. two of Giovanni's sons and a friend noticed in the field, on their way home after the fruitless search for their father, two mysterious humanoid figures with luminous eyes. Only young Andrea Aquilante tried to follow them, but they disappeared. Next morning (Dec. 11,1954), 48 hours after his disappearance, Giovanni returned home, silent and shocked. During the last 48 hours it had rained in the area, but his clothes were quite dry. Later Giovanni Aquilante explained that he met two little \"dwarfs\" in the fields, wearing multi-colored suits. They held his hands, and he began to float into the air with them, starting a \"trip\" to \"unknown places.\" After two days, they released him, but told him they were go- ing to take him again in the future. Since then Giovanni was no longer the same, and lived in the constant fear of his abductors. He was highly esteemed by his neighbors before the incident, and CUN field investigator Umbeto Telarico had a very positive opinion about the whole story when he re-visited the case. It seems this is Italy's first abduc- tion, and the second in the world after 1947. Although it was unsuccessful, the first one was the experience of Ghaseme Fili (GasimFaili) of Amireah Street, in Teheran, Iran, which occurred at 2:30 a.m. on Oct. 8, 1954. This man was on the second floor of his house when he saw a luminous, white flying object stop in mid-air 20 m. away. Lights were shining from the rear and the sides of the craft. Inside could be seen a small man dressed in black, wearing a mask with a trunk like an elephant. \"I was standing with both hands on the bar of my balcony, looking with astonishment at this strange ob- ject, when I suddenly felt as though I were being drawn up toward the object by a magnet,\" he said. Mr. Fili cried out in terror, waking his neighbors. The object shot straight up, emitting sparks, and it was lost to sight almost immediately. As a consequence, Giovanni Aquilante's experience may be considered, after all, the first reported abduction.-Roberto Pinotti July 20-22, 2001-MUFON 2001 International UFO Symposium, Hyatt Regency Irvine, Irvine, CA.

HSV Tech- nologies of San Diego, CA, has developed a functional version of the \"phaser\" weapon made famous by the Star Trek television series. The flashlight-sized weapon works by zapping the distant target person with a harm- less electric current that freezes him in place. The current is transmitted to and from the target through two channels of ionized air. When the air is ionized, electrons are separated from their parent mol- ecules and are free to flow as an electric current: The ionized air channels are in turn produced by beams of ultraviolet laser light. In effect, the laser beams create wires in the air wherever they are pointed. And because the current duplicates the nerve impulses which control skeletal muscles, it is imperceptible to the affected person. The crucial difference is that the pulse repetition rate is sufficiently high to tetanize his muscles. (Tetanization is the stimulation of muscle fibers at a frequency which merges their individual contractions into a sustained contraction.)   . For safety's sake, however, the current is too low to affect the smooth muscles such as the heart and dia- phragm. Importantly, no retinal damage can occur be- cause the cornea absorbs all ultraviolet radiation at the 193-nanometer wavelength used. Moreover, the beams are too weak to irritate the cornea, even when they are directed at the eyes for several minutes. According to HSV Technologies, the calculated maximum range of the beam weapon is more than 100 yards. The company has already obtained three U. S. patents on it, and has performed successful proof-of- principle tests at the University of California. The inventor of the freeze-beam, Eric Herr, came up with the idea after considering the difficulty police officers have in apprehending criminal suspects. In- trigued by both the humanitarian and technical aspects, Herr spent several years determining the precise re- quirements for the weapon's safe and effective opera- tion. \"I was surprised to learn that anesthesiologists have been using tetanization for decades,\" he said. Because the device uses laser technology that has only recently been developed, Herr commissioned Dr. Richard Scheps, a senior scientist at the Naval Research and Development Center in San Diego, to prove its operating principles. Scheps said the project \"has a lot of viability,\" and might even be adapted for use against distant military targets. Further information may be found on HSVT's web page, hsvt.org. (Eric Herr is a long-time MUFON mem- ber in San Diego.) Canadian couple shaken by UFO sighting By Martin Jasek . On March 30, 2000, a man, a woman, and a young boy (who was asleep) were travelling along the Klondike Highway from Whitehorse to the Village of Pelly Crossing, Yukon. The sky was clear with a glow of predawn blue. They were nearing the end of Little Fox Lake and came around a sharp right-hand bend near the base of a mountain. Upon coming out from the bend they could not believe their eyes! To the right and about 300 ft away was a 30 to 40 foot diameter saucer, hovering about 200 feet off the ground! It was stationary for 4 to 5 seconds as they were travelling along the highway, and then it shot across horizontally in front of their vehicle at an \"in- credible speed\" and stopped instantly on the left side of the road. It remained motionless for only another split second and shot off even faster in a different di- rection (basically performing a 90-degree turn and shooting off behind them). They heard no sound. One witness thought it went right into the side of a mountain, while the other thought it followed the mountainous skyline. They eventually pulled over about 20 minutes later and both were shaking. The witnesses got a good look, at the saucer. It was a classic disc shape with a dome on top. The dome had two curved windows or lights from which a beautiful ocean blue or aqua colored light was shining. The sur- face of the craft was described as \"mirror, silver, trans- lucent, shiny, glassy, reflecting the color of the sky.\" It was as though the UFO was trying to \"camouflage against the background sky color.\" As the UFO streaked in front of their vehicle, the car headlights dimmed and their tape deck stopped playing. They both wanted to check the time of their sighting, but the woman's battery-operated analog watch stopped (at 5 a.m.) and the man's digital watch got stuck in \"chrono mode\" and wouldn't reset. A few miles down the road the woman tapped the face of her watch and it started working again. The man fiddled around pushing buttons on his digital watch and it started working as well; the time indi- cated was 5:12 a.m. They checked the tape deck and by all indications, John Fogerty should have been playing away. The tape hadn't run out, the volume was on, and the lights on the cassette window indicated that the power was on. Other than the initial power drain, no problems were noted with the truck. The man figured that they man- aged to get the tape deck and watches functioning prop- erly a couple of miles past the UFO sighting location."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 November 2000 MUFON UFO Journal DNA testing inconclusive Mystery prints on mirror investigated Editor's Note: Australian UFO Researcher Barry Taylor, based in the Northern New South Wales town of Grafton, has been investigating a most un- usual case. At this point there is no direct tie to UFOs, though some aspects of abduction cases seem to be present. This is a preliminary report, and further developments will be shared as they become known. Taylor became involved when a local woman re- ported that a mysterious cross scratch had appeared on her upper left arm while she slept. That morn- ing, her husband pointed out a series of small \"hand\" prints on the bedroom mirror that they had not previously noticed. They contacted Taylor, knowing that he was a UFO researcher who might be familiar with similar cases and hopefully might provide a simple answer. Taylor provides an out- line of the investigation thus far: By Barry Taylor Upon first viewing close magnification of the prints on the mirror, I realised that scientific analysis was required. I do not have the knowledge or equipment personally to undertake these tests, so I contacted Australia's leading physical trace evidence experts who specialize in this field, Phenomena Research Austra- lia (PRA), based in Melbourne Victoria. They supplied me with two DNA sampling kits and detailed instruc- tions. The whole procedure was video-taped so that the PRA Team could study the method I used, and to see if contamination could have accidentally polluted the DNA samples due to my method. Two samples were successfully taken. The prints were removed from the mirror after dusting, and safely stored behind glass. Swab No. 1 sample when first examined under a mi- croscope had dust and other normal atmospheric and surface \"pollutants\" on it, and these were picked off the swab tip before DNA testing was undertaken. This is a normal procedure. There was ONE ONLY cell group on the swab, other than the print material. This single cell group was sepa- rately DNA tested, and showed CANINE [dog]. This was said to have been attached to the mirror by con- tamination and not directly associated with the actual print material. The contamination method is not determined at this stage, but could have been a free-floating airborne cell that had landed on the mirror surface, either before or after the print was made. Two bacteria were found and incubated in Agar. The The angle of the upper arm, as shown here, would be the same as when she was lying asleep in bed. This makes the cross \"drawn\" standing upright, arid appearing to have been applied with precision. A close look shows a precise, delicate application with a fine sharp needle-like tool, as opposed to a \"claw\" or scratch from a cat (which they do not own). There was no redness on either side of the scratch, indicating a \"gentle\" application. The lines are perfectly straight, and equally extended from the center where the scratches cross, forming a perfect cross in all aspects. The woman did not feel anything, and first noticed it upon awakening in the morning. concentration of the bacteria culture was excessive, and a great surprise to-the lab. The two bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Azotobactervinelandii. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a particularly nasty bug, and directly associated with Cystic Fibrosis and other serious infectious illnesses. Both these bacteria are common in soil and water, but the reason they were found in such concentrations in a \"strange hand print\" on a bedroom mirror still remains unexplained. Close examination of the prints does not show the normal ridges and valleys that make human prints iden- tifiable, but were clear enough to show some features such as horizontal lines across the digits. It is hoped that this feature will assist identification. The small size of the prints is unusual. The \"main set\" showing four digits is 2.25 in. wide, and the long- est digit 1.75 in. long, all tapering off into a point. The base of the digits where they would normally attach to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 2000 Page? In collecting the samples, Taylor reports, \"I took all possible precautions so as not to pollute the prints before and during the sample swabs. Comtamination from hair, body fluid, and even the breath could have polluted the sample and shown human DNA in the testing.\" This image is from the video that was set up to record the sampling. The four \"digits\" on the main print are long, slim, and small compared to the human hand. On all five sets of prints there was no print of the \"hand\" or \"main pad\" that the \"digits\" would be expected to be attached to. the hand is wider than expected if the prints were made by a child, and only the last two joints were used to make the prints. Comparisons are being undertaken for this. Altogether, there were four individual sets of prints aligned one above the other on the right hand edge of the mirror at an angle of about 40 degrees, and a single vertical print more towards the lower center. The removed prints were tested for fluorescence with ultraviolet light, but did not respond. It was hoped that the DNA tests would solve this mystery, but it only deepened it. The investigation will continue until we can go no farther with it. So these questions remain: [1] What made the prints? [2] Why was such a dense concentration of com- mon bacteria carried on the \"hand\" that made the prints? [3] Is the mystery cross scratch directly associated with the mirror prints, or just coincidental? [4] Was the canine DNA an airborne cell, or attached to the hand when the prints were made?

Pennsylvania driver frightened MARYSVILLE — Stan Gordon reports a frightened driver had a UFO sighting which occurred on Sept. 19, 2000, between 4:30 and 4:45 a.m. in a rural area. The witness regu- larly travels through this valley with fields sur- rounded by mountains on the way to work. From ap- proximately a mile away, the driver observed \"what looked like stadium lights over an open field.\" This observer knew that no such lights were located in that area. As the wit- ness continued to watch, he lowered his car window, but no sound could be heard. The observer saw two very large non-blinking round white brilliant lights. The luminous source was extremely large, and was estimated as being as long as a football field. At first it seamed as though this was one object, but it became apparent that there were two separate lights positioned side by side. The lights were quite low in altitude, motionless over the field, and according to the driver, the illumination from the lights \"lit up the whole sky.\" The witness proceeded down the road for a distance, then returned several minutes later, but the lights could no longer be seen. During the time of the observation, another vehicle came up the road. The witness is hope- ful that driver of the other car will also report this event. There have been numerous UFO sightings reported during August and September, 2000, across Pennsyl- vania.

The droning lasted about an hour.\" \"This morning, when I got up, my yard was full of this 'spider web stuff.' Don't know exactly how to describe this other than they looked like spider webs, but at the same time they were not your usual 'circu- lar' webs. \"I immediately got the camera out and took a dozen photos. I had my husband go the seven miles to town to buy some rubber gloves so we could get some samples. There were other spots of angel hair along the way, but nothing as heavy as what was in my yard. \"The first sample he tried to get with the gloves soon turned into a goo-like substance as soon as he touched it. He put the samples on a piece of paper towel and put the gloves in with it in a plastic bag. We were able to photograph the angel hair.\" Thanks to Louise A. Lowry. Ohio UFOs tied to power failure WEST MANCHESTER — Ginny Burgess phoned me concerning four UFOs in her backyard on April 8, 1996. The UFO reports were accompanied by various malfunctions of appliances and light bulbs in people's homes that have started again. Back in 1996, two UFOs were spotted over an electric transformer on a utility pole and in two of the neighbors' backyards. Numer- ous reports were collected throughout the area. The local transformer failed, causing the neighborhood to lose all electrical power. \"When the power company work crews came here early that same morning to replace the failed trans- former, I told them what I had seen earlier over this transformer and asked them to save it for study upon returning with it to the power company,\" says Ginny. \"They said they would, and said that they had a lot of failures at their substation. They also said they won- dered due to the other failures whether UFOs might not be the cause for knocking out their other equip- ment, because they said they had been replacing a lot of them lately. \"Later, I was told it was a normal failure and the power company was getting ready to replace that par- ticular transformer anyway. By golly something caused all these power equipment failures.\" It seems the electrical problems are returning, and Ginny's kids are reporting balls of light following them. Ginny explained to me that her home was now being plagued by electrical and phone problems. While talk- ing to her my new Sony phone started buzzing badly.

Thanks to Ginny Burgess burgess@voyager.net Alabama flying triangle BIRMINGHAM—Two engineers observed two slow flying triangles or objects with delta wing con- struction on Tuesday, Sept. 19,2000, at 9:05 p.m.. The wing span was about 100 feet across. Two objects were observed traveling approximately 2 to 3 miles apart at an estimated 200 feet altitude with a speed of around 85 mph. There were two white lights at each wing tip with a red light at the nose. There was no sound being emitted from the objects, and no sign of jet engines. The objects were being followed by a police helicopter around four miles behind. Louisiana flying wing OPELOUSAS — A very large flying wing-shaped object was observed moving north to south Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2000, at 8:55 p.m. with no running lights. There were four or five very faint reddish fore-to-aft light bands, very dim, that marked the edges of the object quite well. Two other aircraft with running lights were visible, one prior to this observation and one immediately after. No sound was heard from the dark object, but the other aircraft were audible. Total viewing arc was 90 degrees. The size is estimated as width of outstretched hand or about the width of a 747 wing at 3,000 feet. (A 747 has a wingspan of 196 feet.) The flying wing was black, and reflected no light. It passed in front of two stars. Overall impression was a very large, dark, wing- shaped object silently moving at a low altitude and a very high speed. Thanks to Peter Davenport National UFO Reporting Center www.ufocenter.com. Note: It is illegal to operate without running lights. The sight- ing over Louisiana and Alabama occurred within a few minutes of each other 300 miles apart. Texas white flash FORT WORTH — Doug McGinnis reports that on Feb. 18,2000, he and his fiance Nantz were outside in their backyard in Westpoint watching the planes fly- ing overhead. \"There were two paths the planes were flying,\" he says, \"one just overhead of us and one to the north. We were commenting on how the aircraft's display lights would constantly change colors and blinking patterns. \"Then at around 9:30 p.m. a plane was flying west overhead at 5000 or 6000 feet when I saw a bright flash of light. Nantz said, 'That plane just shot some- thing!' I immediately noticed a flying object near the plane that was small, only twice the size an aircraft's landing wheels. One light was red and the other white, blinking at about 5 or 6 alternating flashes per second. \"It seemed to move kind of \"jittery\" as it zigzaged its way north towards the other flight path. Both the object and the burst of light came from the right side of the plane. The object was within a \"planes length\" of the aircraft when I first observed it. Four minutes later, it seemed to fly near another plane and soon dis- appeared. \"About 15 minutes later a very similar object flew overhead traveling north in the same weird manner as the first. We have never seen this kind of thing be- fore.\" Thanks to Brenda Livingston, http:// tracers.8m.com/flashes.htm Arkansas contrails OUCHITA NATIONAL FOREST MTS — Louisi- ana MUFON's George Sewell writes, \"I was on a camping trek along the Cossatot River on Sept. 30, 2000, at 2:40 p.m., looking for driftwood when I glanced up and noticed a low-flying, bright white jet. The sky was clear. The jet appeared to be a commer- cial craft, but my attention was focused on how slow it appeared to be going west. \"The jet left a contrail. Then the contrail stopped- a gap. Then another contrail streamed from behind the jet. Then it stopped, creating a gap. Then the craft moved behind the mountain ridge and was no longer visible. The course was from east to west. No reliable estimate of altitude, but the fact that it was low got my attention as I'm quite familiar with commercial and military jet activity. The jet was slightly smaller than my thumb at arm's length. The area is wilderness.\" Thanks to George Sewell georgesewell@hotmail.com Note: Assuming the size of the craft is almost the size of George's thumb, it must have been flying at a fairly low altitude where normal contrails are unable to form. This suggests some kind of spraying was oc- curring over a remote area. Colorado abduction?

My work mates thought I went nuts, but they ran along with me. \"Five minutes later, after searching the sky, we saw one about 10 km away. It was a massive cigar-shaped bright orange craft moving at slow speed from north- west to southeast. It was 45 degrees high, and it flew past for about 35 seconds in the areabetween the build- ings opposite us. Regrettably, we have a huge build- ing across the street blocking our view of the pyra- mids, so we couldn't see the other UFO. \"My mother and her driver were much more fortu- nate. She parked on el-Muneeb Bridge, and had a clear view. She described them as two massive 'neon bars,' each 30 meters long (100 feet), coming at slow speed from opposite directions, meeting exactly above the second pyramid. They paused above each other for a half a minute or so and then continued moving in op- posite directions. \"The UFOs were a beautiful sight over the Giza com- plex at sunset for 15 minutes. My mother, felt they resembled a UFO that emitted white smoke that she had seen in Alexandria four months earlier.\" Omar further explained that strange things had been happening to him in recent days prior to the sighting. He states, \"I called a friend of mine, one of Egypt's top columnists, who at first thought I was mad, but realized he had also seen them when he flew in from Rome. He wrote about what we saw in four episodes in his weekly column in Al-ahram. Thanks to Omar Hilal.

The Scifi.com portion showed an excellent home video of a couple taking a helicopter tour of New York City with an amazing disc-shaped UFO in the video in flight. Close-up pictures were very good of the UFO, and its speed was amazing. Thanks to USDSCUBA Note: The video can be seen on www.sightings.com New Jersey UFO seen from aircraft Michael L. Stovall reports, \"One observation I have made, as I fly a good deal, is that the UFOs occasion- ally seem to be more easily seen from the side than from the underside. I have watched them from a side view, then could not see them when I got underneath. They just looked like the sky, clouds or clear. Perhaps a camouflage effect is in place. Ever heard of such from others?\" Note: In a.case I investigated with Dr. Don Johnson at McGuire Air Force Base in 1980, a witness called the base and told them they had two disc-shaped UFOs over the base. The witness owned an Art Supply Com- pany and drew the UFOs on his window with a grease pencil. He was an excellent witness and I have no doubt that he saw them. The Air Force looked outside and claimed they couldn't see anything. The witness called a neighbor who could also see the UFOs hovering over the base. They then called the state police. Those under the UFOs could not see them. Those off to the side were able to do so. On triangulation of the UFO position from the witnesses it turned out they were hovering over a nuclear weapons storage site.

An erratic moving object was traveling east and then circled back twice at about 8,000 feet. \"The craft had blue flashes coming from it, and through a spotting scope and binoculars it looked tri- angular in shape. No sound could be heard. The UFO moved very erratically, and it would stop and start, and zig zag while it gained and lost altitude. We saw this UFO for about 45 minutes and then it disappeared. We also saw three other craft that accomplished mind boggling maneuvers. Two UFOs, one approaching from the east and the other from the west, appeared to be at the same altitude. \"They were heading right for each other at 9:40 p.m., and were about to collide when both performed a twirl- ing maneuver. The one heading east gained in altitude and went out of sight, and the one going west went back to a steady course and out of sight. At 10:05 p.m., a blue flashing object was approaching from the west, and it was moving toward what we thought was a star."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 2000 Page 11 The blue strobing craft appeared to run into the star making a bright blue flash upon impact.

Ohio multiple UFOs dazzle GIRARD — Investigator Kenny Young interviewed Rodney Happney of Youngstown, who reported sight- ing a UFO in Trumbull County on Sept. 19, 2000. Happney was formerly in the 82nd Airborne Infantry as a paratrooper and is very familiar with many types of aircraft. While driving north on Salt Springs Road between 12:10 and 12:15 p.m., Happney caught a glimpse of something in the sky. \"I just saw these things from the corner of my eye,\" he said. The next thing that caught Happney's attention was a crowd of people standing in the parking lot of a Sheetz Convenience store and gas station. . ,.., \"This crowd of 25 people were all standing around looking up, and I realized we were looking at the same thing, so I decided to pull in and stop.\" The objects, which were described as roundish star-like lights, in the daytime sky, seemed \"pretty high,\" yet below the thin cloud layer Happney observed a total of six inde- pendent objects. Some of the objects would shoot straight up above the clouds, while others would seem to roll around and reflect sunlight. , They would perform quick \"bee-like\" maneuvers and then assume a formation in what appeared from his vantage point to be a straight line. \"Two of these ob- jects from the rear of the straight-line formation would remain stationary while the rest of these things just fell, suddenly,\" Happney recalled. \"They seemed to be fly- ing or buzzing around real high, but there was no sound at all that I could hear.\" The objects continued to scatter about before they made a rapid departure to the east. Happney said he had never seen anything pull away at the speed these objects traveled. \"Nothing could compare to how fast these things were going,\" he said, and declared that these objects were nothing that could be addressed with a satisfactory explanation. He was absolutely certain they were no type of aircraft or military jets in practice or mock combat. The crowd of spectators was pretty worked up, ac- cording to Happney. After the objects departed from sight, he reports that a C-5 military plane overflew the area. \"No more than 15 or 20-seconds after these things pulled away.\" After the sighting, Happney was excited about the occurrence, called 911, and eventually got the Youngstown Airport. He was informed that noth- ing was seen at the time in question. Happney was advised by the tower operator to contact the National UFO Reporting Center and he did.

Both of them noticed that the crickets and bugs went totally silent suddenly and simultaneously. The lights flew toward them 40 feet above the ground just clear- ing the trees. She felt 'they' were interested in the lake because it's drying up. 'They' then appeared to realize that she and her friend were parked watching. \"The 'UFO lights' swung towards them, and when the lights illuminated their vehicle and them inside, she said she and her male friend could feel the heat from the beams of light. Then the lights swung away and turned back towards the trees and were gone from sight. \"Ever since this UFO sighting there has been a 'ghost' in her basement. I asked her to tell me about this ghost, and she said that she isn't seeing a clear outline or features, but rather it is more like several balls of light, but she was explicit in using the term 'ghost' a number of times in our conversation.

For a month, I would see these dancing lights just outside. I would be compelled to go or look outside. Also I would feel like I was being watched. I would be watching TV and feel a presence; but when I turned around I didn't see any- thing. I was scared to go to bed with all the lights out. \"I went to bed at 3 a.m. and I was very tired. All I remember was just laying my head down. Next thing I was wide awake and I couldn't move. The whole room was filled with this whitish-bluish light, and I saw this tall hooded figure walk across the window in my room! I couldn't move and I was frightened. Then I got this calm feeling, and I guess I went out, because I opened my eyes in the morning. I was wondering what hap- pened, and who was in my room. I know without a shadow of doubt there was someone there. \"My roommate told me he had something very simi- lar happen to him too that night and he woke up fright- ened and on the floor. The room was filled with the whitish-bluish light and a tall hooded figure was hov- ering above him. He was scared out of his mind and was wondering what the heck is going on. Since then I haven'thad any encounters. I've seen the dancing lights since I was a child, but I don't want to encounter what my roommate and I encountered again.\" Thanks to Elizabeth Wall California disc BERKELEY—A witness reports, \"On Sept. 15, 2000, at 8:57 p.m. while looking west over the Pacific Ocean just after sunset, an orange light was seen about 5 degrees above the horizon. At first we thought it was a star or planet. It appeared to be pulsating. We got out our telescope and observed a black disc, and this was surrounded by a pulsating orange halo. It slowly moved below the horizon in about 5 minutes.\" (Peter Davenport Note: \"We spoke briefly with this witness and addressed whether the object might have been an aircraft flying west, reflecting light from the setting sun. The witnesses reported that they had ad- dressed that possibility, and rejected it. They appar- ently got a very good look at the object, and found it to be exceptionally strange. Witnesses hold quite re- sponsible jobs.\") Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC www.ufoceriter.com Air Force \"UFO\"? Popular Mechanics' cover story of the November 2000 issue reports that the Air Force attempted to de- velop a Lenticular Reentry Vehicle (LRV) that was 40 feet in diameter, 90 inches thick at the center, and had an empty weight of 17,042 pounds. The craft was designed to operate for six weeks at an altitude of 300 nautical miles. It was part of the black budget, classi- fied as secret on Dec. 12, 1962, and remained classi- fied until May 1999. Thereafter, the Department of Defense successfully sought to have the documents distribution restricted to defense contractors. Popular Mechanics obtained a copy of the documents and speculates the LRV may have been responsible for some UFO sightings. An engineering study describes a reentry heating test that, at the time, could have allegedly been accomplished only by a high-altitude drop of a flying prototype, prob- ably from a high altitude balloon. A friend of mine claims to have seen the LRV at a Florida base in the late 1960s. The Popular Mechanics article also speculates that an LRV crash may have been responsible for honey- comb-like debris Jean Fraser found during 1975 on her family's ranch in Brisbane. According to a report by the University of New South Wales, the debris con- tained minerals commonly found in aircraft-grade fi- berglass panels. Based on the report, MUFON rejected rumors that the debris was of alien origin.

It takes about 1/2 hour to 45 minutes to drive home to San Luis Obispo, CA. I was just about to enter the city limits, when up ahead about 300 yards in front of me and 75 feet above the highway, I observed a huge mas- sive light, lime-green, luminous object drifting/glid- ing across the highway up to the top of a hill, where it stopped in mid-air. The outer edges of the craft were luminous or fluorescent like neon lights. There were no silver or metallic markings at all. I looked at my watch, and it was exactly 11:45 p.m. I pulled my car over and turned my radio off. This object made no noise. After 2 minutes, with me more in awe than fright, I just stood there on the highway and said (to myself), \"My God what can this thing be?\" It was clear and well defined. There were no windows. It was shaped like a football. Its size was 1/2 of a baseball field. It moved from south to north and hovered for just around two minutes. Then it started moving a little more north, then headed east and, at literally incredible speed, ac- celeration was something out of science fiction—no sonic boom and it was gone! I want to state here, I don't drink alcohol, I don't do drugs, and I don't even drink coffee or caffeine. I was wide-awake and had all my senses. There was no miss- ing time. My car did not stall. Other than the craft, I observed nothing else. This experience has changed my life. I have always been a skeptic. Also, I was alone in my car. I looked for other vehicles, and there were none on my side of the road and none on the opposite side. Normally, this is a well-traveled highway. The object crossed the highway in front of me and went up to the top of the hill, then it was behind the radio tower located on the top of the hill. From my vantage-point, the radio tower was in front of me (look- ing toward the hill). Please help me to understand what this sighting was. You folks have knowledge and scientific know-how to explain this to a novice like me. In my whole life I have never observed anything like this. It was so close to me, not way up in the sky. I just wish I had a cam- era. I work in law enforcement and I am afraid to tell or relate this for fear of ridicule. I did check into the police log for that night and nothing was reported. However, through my humble attempts to investigate this, a friend's neighbor woman reported observing this object.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly As one would expect from a researcher like Dick Hall, this is a well done compilation of some of the best reports of the first half of the 20th Century. Hall included only reports which he felt were reasonably substantial, and which did not easily lend themselves to prosaic explanations. Hall acknowledges those researchers who have pro- vided much of the material for this publication, includ- ing Lou Parish, Jerry Clark, Eddie Bullard, Barry Greenwood, Loren Gross, and Jan Aldrich of the United States, plus Bill Chalker (Australia), Anders Liljegren (Sweden), Ole Jonny Braenne (Norway), and Domin- ique Weinstein (France). Hall notes that these reports may be somewhat less valuable than contemporary reports, due to possible contamination, faulty memories, or other factors, but concludes that they are still interesting and still worth considering. The more than 100 reports in this collection dem- onstrate once again that the-UFO phenomenon did not begin with Arnold or with Roswell, and that some of the reports of nearly 100 years ago are strangely simi- lar to current reports. The March 17,1903, report from Helmer, IN, is one example: \"One hour plus after sunset. Father and daughter observed brilliantly glowing cigar-shaped object with two rows of equally spaced windows, four in each row, hovering just behind the upper branches of three maple trees.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly If we assume that UFO occupants are extraterres- trial, then this compilation of the thoughts of five Ph.D.'s representing astronomy, religion, sociology, psychology, and folklore as to how we might react to proof of their existence is apropos. This question has been dealt with before, of course, by NASA, Dr. Barry Downing, and many others, in- cluding the French COMETA report. (The final seven pages of this paper, in fact, are devoted to the \"Politi- cal and Religious Implications\" discussed in the COMETA report.) Despite the credentials of all those who have dealt with this question, we still don't know how the world would react to proof that UFO entities are extraterres- trial. Much depends on what that proof consists of, what we perceive the entities to look and act like, and what we perceive to be their power and intent. These issues, which should be of concern to world leaders, are ably discussed in this paper, and there is enough new material presented to make this presenta- tion worthwhile \"Taming Gravity\" by Jim Wilson, Popular Me- chanics, October, 2000, pages 40-43. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly One of the mysteries of UFOs involves flight char- acteristics, and this in turn often involves questions concerning the possibility of devices that can some- how affect gravity. Mainstream scientists have tradi- tionally claimed that an antigravity device is theoreti- cally impossible. That may be changing to> some ex- tent. Ning Li, one of the world's leading scientists, pre- dicted in the 1980's that if a time-varying magnetic field were applied to superconductor ions trapped in a lattice structure, the ions would begin to spin rapidly, causing each ion to create a minuscule gravitational field. In a high temperature superconducting disc (HTSD), the tiny gravitational effect of each individual atom is multiplied by the billions of atoms in the disc. Li says that, using about one kilowatt of electricity, her device could potentially produce a force field that would effectively neutralize gravity above a one-foot- dia. region extending from the surface of the planet to outer space. Thus far the device being developed is only a 12-inch-diameter disc, but when completed is expected to generate a force field powerful enough to support a bowling ball placed anywhere above the disc. Jonathan Campbell, a scientist at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center who is working with Li, explains, \"The first thing to understand about Li's de- vice is that it is neither an antigravity machine nor a gravitational shield. It does not modify gravity. Rather it produces a gravity-like field that may be either at- tractive or repulsive.\" Since the device can be either attractive or repul- sive, Li refers to it as AC gravity. She says the device generates a never-before-seen force field that acts on"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 2000 Page 15 matter in a way that is similar to gravity. Larry Smalley, former chairman of the University of Alabama at Huntsville Physics Department, says, \"Basically you are adding a couple of vectors to zero gravity out or enhance it.\" Einstein's theory of rela- tivity predicts this effect. All objects produce gravito- magnetic energy, the amount of force proportional to its mass and acceleration. The reason this energy has not been detected, says Li, is because the Earth spins so slowly, and the field's strength decreases rapidly as you move away from the center of the planet. Although the ions have a minuscule mass, they ro- tate more than a quadrillion times a second, compared with the massive Earth's rotation of once a day. Li says this tremendous speed of rotation will compen- sate for the small mass of the ions. If a large enough disc is constructed, the cumulative field should be measurable, says Li, and an even larger disc should enable scientists to control the force field. While Li's device has passed the preliminary steps, including peer review, several million dollars are needed to build the induction motor that individually spins the ions in the HTSD. When and if developed, the device has consider- able potential. Says Campbell: \"It's a gravity-like force you can point in any direction. It could be used in space to protect the international space station against impacts by small meteoroids and orbital debris.\" (This application rings a ufological bell as we recall witness reports of what appeared to be force fields around landed UFOs.)

First off, I would rather not have my name used at this point. I am one of your investiga- tors (not trained), but I am also working full time for the INS as a naturalization examiner. I retired from the U.S. Border Patrol in 1990 as patrol agent in charge of a large station at Campo, CA. I reinstated as an an- nuitant with INS in 1997 with the Citizenship USA program and will remain with that for another year probably, then I would like to get into UFO investiga- tions. Now, about Carlsbad. I was stationed there from No- vember of 1960 until April of 1965. During that time there was a lot of UFO activity and some really strange things going on around that area from White Sands (Alamogordo) to north of Roswell. During that time the old AEC had an office in Carlsbad and they finally did an underground atomic bomb shoot in one of the potash mines in 1964,1 believe. We used to go by the AEC office and visit with the two-way radio tech, Jim Divens. He was one of those natural radio guys, self taught, who got on with AEC when he was about 24. Jim used to fix our radios in our patrol vehicles because we could never get our own techs to come up from El Paso Sector HQ because of the distance. Anyway, Jim told us about some really strange things around the area and near Las Vegas. They used to send him up there to work on underground shoots. I believe he was in Area 51, but he said he was sworn to secrecy about the names of places he went. I believe he died at a young age (about 27) from going down in the \"hot holes\" right after a nuclear shoot. He would tell us about doing that, and we told him he was crazy. Anyway, he told us that there were underground in- stallations around that the military had. One, he said, was a gigantic underground base located northeast of Roswell, NM, in that desert area between there and Clovis, NM. We went scouting around out there one time in a 4X, and it is one big sand dune nothing. Jim said they had found a limestone cavern out there that literally dwarfed the Carlsbad Caverns. It was big enough to fly planes into, he said, through a sliding door that hid the entrance, somewhat like the old mis- sile silos. Jim also said there were other such installa- tions that were found connected to the Carlsbad Cav- erns. I know that country west of the Caverns. It is rug- ged and remote. I also know that ranch country east of Carlsbad in the Lincoln National Forest. We used to track aliens up there. There were also some UFO sightings above that area. I have two friends who saw them-one at night and another during daytime. The daytime story was most likely an abduction from what I was told by this young guy and his wife who were driving back to Carlsbad from El Paso. Anyway, don't forget that Carlsbad also had an Army Air Corps base during WW II. It is not well known, but one of our Border Patrol pilots used to fly up from El Paso, and he told me about it one time. He took me around to the various touch-and-go strips all over the area and west Texas where he used to prac- tice with bombers before going overseas. But Jim Bivens told me about all the caverns in the area and rumors he had heard about them (he never claimed to have been in any of them-only in Nevada.) God, I wish I could have talked to him before he died. He might have been able to shed a lot of light on some things around Area 51. We were pretty close friends. So, Carlsbad may just well be as interesting a point for UFOs as Roswell. There may be some secrets hid- den underground all over eastern New Mexico. My ex-partner was in charge of the Alamogordo Border Patrol station from about 1977 until he retired in about 1986 or so. I was in Indio, CA, with the BP at the time when a strange story got to me about two border patrol agents prowling around the McGregor Missile range south of White Sands. They reportedly saw a strange outcrop- ping of land, like a volcanic cone. They climbed up it to find it hollowed out like a crater with a flying sau- cer parked at the bottom being attended by Air Force personnel. They got away from the area and after work met with other agents at a local watering hole and were telling about what they saw. Reportedly a couple of guys in black suits showed up at the bar and asked them to come along. They were reportedly transferred immediately out of the area to the East Coast as plain clothes investigators. I called my old partner (name on file with MUFON, but not for publication) and asked him about the ru- mored event.

He is that kind of man. So, make of it what you will. I had a friend, Ray Ahlstrom, who lived in Carlsbad when I did. He is also an ex-Marine Raider WWII, a solid guy, who died a couple of years ago. He told me about the sighting of a UFO over that area Bill Dungan talks about, Canyon Ridge. Ray did not see the UFOs close enough to ID them, but saw them around that mountain area on a couple of occasions, as he told me back in about 1965. His son-in-law and daughter were the ones who reported the possible abduction near Carlsbad Caverns in the daytime that I mentioned ear- lier. They did not really know what had happened to them at the time. Well, all for now. Please contact me—perhaps I can recall some other things about Carlsbad. COMETA comments I have just received, in France, recent issues of the International UFO Reporter (IUR) of CUFOS (Sum- mer) and the MUFON UFO Journal (October). Both feature an article on the French Cometa Report, pub- lished last year. I found the CUFOS article, edited by Mark Rodegheir, excellent. Thank you to CUFOS and IUR for this good piece of information. My only criticism would be to the overestimated meaning of the trans- formation of GEPAN into SEPRA: the real meaning was to downscale that service, reducing it to a one- man operation (engineer Velasco) with a very limited role. It is known that the Director of CNES has no interest in UFOs and strongly dislikes the public appearences of that engineer. I am less pleased with the article in the Journal, \"The Cometa Report-A Third view,\" signed by French ufologist Claude Mauge. He starts by pointing out that my article, published in the MUFON UFO Journal in September, 1999, had a misleading title: \"A quasi-of- ficial Document.\" But I never wrote that title! The/owr- nal did it, and I strongly disagree, like Mauge, with that title. I would appreciate a correction made in the next issue. For the record, I am the one who corrected an announcement made by Pery Petrakis on the \"IHEDN Report\" to point out that the authors are an independant group called \"Cometa\" (see his message of July 13, and mine of July 17 on UFO UpDates). Mauge accuses COMETA of having misrepresented its report as an \"official\" one. This is not true, in my opinion. Yes, there was a mention on the cover of the public edition \"The Confidential Report Given To The President And The Prime Minister,\" but that does not mean it was \"official.\" It just meant what it said. Another point: in his preface General Norlain, former Director of the very official IHEDN\" (Institute of Advanced Studies for National Defense) stresses that many of the authors have been members of that institute, but he does not say that it is a report by the institute. All in all, this is a second-rate quarrel, which misses the main point that several senior officers of high rank have come out to speak about UFOs and say they are real and probably of extraterrestrial origin. Claude Mauge is a typical French \"psycho-socio- logical\" ufologist, who explains all UFO sightings by mundane factors. So it is kind of shocking to him to see a bunch of generals put forward the ETH hypoth- esis. Hence, his systematic attack on COMETA. Ironi- cally, he reproaches them for not having talked of ab- ductions. I wonder what he would have said if they had? His conclusion is that the mere existence of that re- port suggests that \"there is no secret investigation about UFOs in France.\" Seems to be a reasonable conclu- sion, but it also seems to be like pushing an open door. -Gildas Bourdais Editor's Note: Readers (and critics) should be aware that in most publications the headlines are not written by the authors of the articles (except maybe in quasi-official reports).

His U.S. birth and resulting U.S. citizenship occurred while his father was serving as a United Nations offi- cial in New York. While growing up, Antonio attended American schools in Santiago, Chile, and in Ecuador because his father wanted him to learn English. He also studied French at Sorbonne and journal- ism at the University of Chile. In Chile he worked as a science journalist. \"I had no particular in- terest in UFOs at the time,\" he re- calls, \"and thought that if scien- tists weren't talking about them it was probably not a very seri- ous topic.\"  . In 1975 Antonio came to the Antoni ° Huneeus U.S. to claim his citizenship, a 24-year-old would-be writer with little money and few connections. \"I could read and speak English,\" he explains, \"but I couldn't write it very well, so as a journalist it was a little tough to get started.\" He tried various things, living in Washington, D.C., for awhile before moving to New York City. About two years after coming back to the U.S. he wrote his first UFO article. \"This was about the famous Corporal Valdez case in Chile,\" he says. \"My brother sent me the clippings from Chile. I don't know why, because I wasn't inter- ested in the subject, but it had been published in im- portant papers in Chile.\" There was a newspaper in New York called the New York Daily Planet which had a section on UFOs, so Antonio decided to write up the story and see if they would use it. They did, send- ing him a check for $15.00. \"This was the first article I had published in English,\" says Antonio. \"This was an interesting time for ufology,\" he notes. \"Peter Gersteh and others were getting material through the FOIA, which had recently been passed. CAUS was active/Then there was the UN initiative with Prime Minister Gairy of Granada.\" Although Huneeus had written only a few UFO ar- ticles by the time the UN hearing was held in 1978, he says he \"somehow managed to get invited\" to the UN hearing as a member of the press. He met J. Allen Hynek and Jacques Vallee there, and his interest in ufology continued to grow. \"It was very, very excit- ing,\" he recalls. As a result of the UN meeting, Antonio met the late Colman VonKeviczky, founder and director of .Inter- continental Galactic Spacecraft Research and Analytic Network. \"I guess he became my mentor,\" says Huneeus. \"I was still a newcomer in the field. I had read a couple of books maybe and written a few ar- ticles.\" VonKeviczky, a native of Hungary, had extensive international contacts, as well as a good collection of books and documents. \"He needed young blood for his organization, and he needed someone to help him with his English,\" says Huneeus. \"I was full of enthu- siasm and needed to learn. It was perfect.\" Antonio also made contacts with magazines over- seas, including one in Spain called Unknown World. This led to some articles, but he was still unable to make enough money by writing to support himself. His next interesting contact was Pete Mazzola, who was with an organization called Scientific Bureau of Investigation (SBI). \"He was a New York City police detective, and had a lot of cops in his organization, and I joined them,\" says Antonio. \"SBI helped me learn some investigative techniques, and their sympo- sium in Albany in 1983 was the first symposium I lec- tured at.\" His first MUFON symposium was in 1982 in Toronto, where he first met Walt Andrus. Len Stringfield, who had been at the UN presentation, was on hand, as was Hynek and others. \"I conducted a lot of interviews,\" says Huneeus. He joined MUFON the next year. One of his sisters moved to Houston, and Antonio was able to work with John Schuessler and \"a kind of UFO underworld at the Johnson Space Center.\" He was writing articles and a column for the New York City Tribune at this time. MUFON tapped him to be a research specialist, then South America coordinator. \"I used to go to South America quite often, and I wrote a lot about South America,\" he notes. \"By the late 1980's I started branching into more international things, including Russian sightings-giants seen in a park and so on. I also met a lot of Russian ufologists at a symposium in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1989. This was the first time Russian ufologists had been allowed to travel outside their country.\" Using his Russian contacts, Huneeus published a"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 2000 Page 19 book in 1990, Psychic and Paranormal Phenomena in the USSR, which he calls \"a small study guide.\" It is now out of print. In the early 1990's he began working with Japanese ufologists, but continued his attendance at symposia in Spain and other places. He was now also giving pre- sentations, including a talk at the 1990 MUFON sym- posium in Pensacola. \"Working with the Japanese was very good,\" says Antonio, \"especially financially. They paid very well, and I ended up going to Japan three times on projects.\" In 1990 he was appointed International Coordina- tor for MUFON. Huneeus did some work on Belgian cases, due to his knowledge of French, and in 1995 was contacted to work on the UFO Briefing Document, which was published in 1996 by the UFO Research Coalition, which MUFON is part of. It is to be printed commer- cially by Dell, and edited by Whitley Strieber-the first of a series to be edited by Strieber. \"Joe Firmage has bought the Internet rights for the document,\" explains Huneeus. \"It was meant for VIPs, the media, Congress, and so on, including overseas. It was widely distributed in France, and did its job better there than in the U.S., and the COMETA Report quotes the document several times. Probably the UFO Brief- ing Document had the least impact in the U.S., maybe because there was no organized plan of distribution or follow-up.\" Huneeus says he gave a copy of the document to Gen. Vega, former commander of the Chilean Air Force and now an important senator \"who is very interested in UFOs.\" Antonio attended a conference earlier this year in Chile. \"This was the first anywhere that was sponsored by an air force. It was part of a very large international expo called International Expo of Aero- nautics and Space,\" explains Antonio. \"It was basi- cally an arms bazaar, but a UFO symposium was part of it, coordinated by this committee which is under civil aviation, but integrated with the Air Force.\" He says he does \"see movement\" internationally in the UFO field. \"I don't know of any formal meeting of the governments of the world,\" he says. \"I'm not into conspiracies, and I don't think there is an interna- tional UFO coverup. The majority of countries are just stretched out for funds. Some of the more wealthy countries, such as the U.S. or Brazil, may have UFO projects. But England is worse than the U.S. when it comes to releasing documents. No FOIA. After 30 years the British declassify only documents that they want to.\"\" Huneeus notes that the little country of San Marino in Europe has had a large UFO conference for many years. \"It's open to everyone, and there is no fee, but the main industry there is tourism. They fill a theatre with 700 people who have to get hotel rooms, eat, and otherwise spend money. It's sponsored by the Depart- ment of tourism, but it allows international ufologists to interact-and it's not too expensive.\" Huneeus is keeping busy with various projects, in- cluding a regular column for Fate Magazine. He has also worked on a Chilean TV series, interviewing such American notables as Peter Sturrock, John Schuessler, Richard Haines, Budd Hopkins, and Zecharia Sitchin. He's also in the early stages of a history project which he does not want to discuss just yet. Antonio is somewhat surprised that there are few foreign ufology books translated into English for sale in the U.S. \"There is a whole world of ufology out there that I think Americans are mostly missing,\" he says. Huneeus also notes what he calls \"an interesting trend\" in recent years of philantropists financing projects. \"I have worked with the commercial side, and with philanthropists, and I prefer the philantropist. You don't have to sell yourself out.\" California sighting similar to one reported following day Malcolm Uhl, a MUFON investigator trainee and ham radio operator located on the Feather River Can- yon, Belden, CA., has sent the following report: \"On June 16, 1999, two couples and myself were sitting at the campground fire ring at 2:30 p.m. talk- ing. To our left was Caribou Road, ENE of Belden. At approximately 35 degrees to the horizon was a large metallic craft 50 feet in length, stationary, bright sil- ver in color, and apparently noiseless. \"In the July issue of the Journal on page 9 is a per- fect sketch of this craft. It was observed by two gold prospectors on June 17 (one day after we saw it) at approximately the same time while working on their gold claim on Rush Creek.

Three of them have played significant roles and conversed by telephone with many of our mem- bers, achieving a first name basis. This article is basi- cally a tribute to each of them and a thank you for their dedicated work. VIRGINIA CASTNER Virginia firsl became involved with MUFON in Seguin when she typed the master copies for the MUFON 1977 UFO Symposium Proceedings m ihe spring of 1977. \"Jinny\" was employed by MUFON in October of 1977 and has worked with us for 23 years. She was born Sept. 27, 1936, in Cambridge, OH. She and her husband, John, have one daugh- ter, \"Becky,\" and six grandchil- dren. She had numerous civil ser- vice jobs associated with the U. S. Navy as her husband moved to new assignments. John passed away on May 18,1998. Virginia became our office manager in 1980 and was promoted to MUFON Assistant Treasurer in 1995, working with Tom M. Whitmore, our present corpo- rate Treasurer. PHYLLIS H. HUTSON Phyllis was hired by MUFON as .1 set rciary in April of 1991 and retired in September of 1997 10 help her husband, Keith, with the clerical work of his job as a worldwide consultant in the Composites Textiles Industry. Keith was formerly the MUFON State Section Director for Guadalupe County. They have two married daugh- ters and one grandson. Phyllis worked as a secretary at Randolph AFB from 1956 to Phyllis Hutson 1988. Born in Wisconsin, Phyllis, moved to Seguin in 1956, where she and her husband still reside. Virginia Castner ELIZABETH ANN KNOWLES Ann, as she prefers to be called, started at MUFON on Sept. 9, 1997. She and her husband, Michael J. Knowles, are both retired school teachers. They have two grown married children with one grand- child. Ann was born in Brownwood, TX,onFeb. 11,1936. In addition to her career as a teacher, Ann worked .u the Pentagon from 1956 to I9SS js a secretary to a Lt. Colonel in the U. S. Army She and Mike moved to Seguin Ann Knowles in June of 1996. Her hobbies include sewing crafts. She acquired her Masters degree in 1981. Both Virginia and Ann continued to provide cleri- cal and bookkeeping services to MUFON after the of- ficial move to Littleton, CO, on Sept. 3, 2000, until trained personnel were available in the Denver area. For me, it has has been a distinct pleasure working with these congenial and cooperative ladies. Andrus presented Gray Barker Lifetime Achievement Award Walter H. Andrus, Jr., who served as International Director of the Mutual UFO Network from 1970 un- til this past July, was presented the Gray Barker Me- morial Lifetime Achievement Award at the 34th An- nual National UFO Conference in Corpus Christi, TX, on Sept. 23. The award was accepted by Dennis Stacy, former editor of the Journal, on behalf of Andrus, who was attending the funeral of his wife Jeanne. \"I'm very honored to have been recognized in this manner by Jim Moseley and the National UFO Con- ference,\" said Andrus. 2000 MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS Theme: UFOs in the New Millennium in St. Louis, MO.

As an active participant in the UFO Research Coalition, I look around for the \"Young Turks\" who are going to replace us when we fade away, and I am disturbed by what I see. Also, at a recent board meeting of the Fund for UFO Research, Dick Haines asked us to look around the table at the \"graybeards\" present and to think about the transition problem. During our \"watch,\" the re- ported nature of the UFO phenomenon has changed drastically from one of unidentified airborne objects to alleged intimate interaction with alien beings. Re- search and investigation are more complicated than ever, and where is the cadre of younger people to lead the way? To be sure, you can find on the internet many bright young people (along with all too many highly opin- ionaied egomaniacs) who accomplish some good work. But ihey arc not \"joiners,\" their work tends to get cir- culated only privately to a few people, and peer re- view is almost nonexistent. There is no public or truly scientific (in the full sense) component to their work such as the major organizations practice: public edu- cation, systematic data gathering and investigation, and symposia and seminars to exchange information and to interact with colleagues. My first awareness ol UFOs was as a high school student some 50 years ago. First I collected random newspaper stories, then gradually got more and more involved. The need for organization and peer group cooperation was obvious to me, and I have worked with several organizations over the years. Today, the UFO subject is more associated with \"en- tertainment\" in the public mind than it is with a \"sci- entific mystery.\" All those \"pop-schlock\" documenta- ries, 95% of which are not worthy of the name, don't help. They cheapen and trivialize the subject, and sel- dom display any critical judgment at all. Hoax photos and con-men are thrown in equally with serious facts. To me, the survival of well-organized, scientifically oriented UFO research is of top-rank, even urgent, importance. Without it, so-called ufology will disap- pear entirely, fade into folklore and myth, and an en- tirely garbled and inaccurate history of the phenom- enon and human reactions to it will be our legacy. The debunkers will have won. Solo operators on the internet and part-time weekend \"researchers\" may be able to get some personal satisfaction out of their hobby, but what good will it be doing humanity? The major organizations hove a serious problem in finding good people to recruit, get involved, and men- tor. The \"talent pool\" seems lo be very thin. Probably the main reasons for this are a lack of focus, a lack of a carefully crafted plan of action, and of course a lack of financial resources. Starting next year, I plan to cut back on my UFO- related activities somewhat for two simple reasons: (1) it is past time for me to build up my retirement nest egg (there is little money to be made in UFOs unless you are a sensationalist); and (2) I want to do some writing for pay on other subjects that are fun for me, and that also have prospects for generating some roy- alty income for my retirement. My interest in the UFO phenomenon is as strong as ever, but one person can do only so much. Meanwhile, I have high hopes for The UFO Evi- dence, Volume //, which about now is going to press for December release. If properly reviewed, marketed, and distributed, it has the potential to give badly needed focus to UFOs and to attract the type of support that is so badly needed.

The imposing planet lies only 2 degrees above the lunar crescent on the 29th. Jupiter (-2.8) and Saturn (-0.2) remain in Taurus less than 10 degrees apart. The two giants can be seen above the eastern horizon in the early evening. As the Earth rotates, the planet pair moves across the southern sky during the night. The Cassini spacecraft, launched in 1997, flies by Jupiter on Dec. 30, getting its 4th and final gravity boost from three planets in order to reach Saturn by mid-2004. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (1.5), in Virgo, rises in the E about 2 a.m. and is visible in the SE at dawn. Jupiter and Saturn set in the NW half an hour apart, Saturn first before 5 a.m. in mid-December. A Christmas Eclipse: A partial eclipse of the Sun is observable on Christ- mas Day from the U.S. except Alaska and Hawaii. The Moon gradually covers a varying fraction of the solar disc, the amount depending upon one's location. Local times of maximum eclipse with obscuration percentages at several cities follow: Seattle, 8:29 a.m., 25%; Los Angeles, 8:23 a.m., 8%; Denver, 9:44 a.m., 27%; Chicago, 11:17 a.m., 43%; Miami, 12:38 p.m., 20%; New York, 12:47 p.m., 44%. The rule for safely viewing this type of eclipse: Do not look directly at the Sun unless one uses a special eye filter such as a #14 welder's glass. If unsure, ob- serve the eclipse indirectly by projecting the Sun's image through a binocular or telescope eyepiece onto any white surface. Moon Phases: First quarter — December 3 Full moon — December 11 Last quarter — December 17 New moon — December 25 €) O The Stars: The brilliant constellations of winter are taking the place of the inconspicuous autumn stars during the midevening. The Winter Circle stars-Sirius, Procyon, Pollux and Castor, Capella, Aldebaran, and Rigel-sur round that most spectacular of patterns, Orion the Hunter. It doesn't take much imagination to visualize the figure of the great warrior in the heavens. Betelgeuse (Orion's right shoulder) and Rigel (his left knee) provide a fine comparison of color differ- ences between stars. Betelgeuse's reddish hue indicates that it is a relatively cool M-type star, while blue-white Rigel is a hot B star. Our own Sun's yellow color tells us it is of medium surface temperature-a G type.

Kathy Schuessler, Barbra Maher, and I imme- diately gave the place a thorough cleaning in prepara- tion for the move-in process. The moving truck was loaded in Seguin, TX, dur- ing the weekend of Sept. 30/Oct. 1, by Walt Andrus, his son Don, Tom Deuley, and members of San Anto- nio MUFON. Tom drove the truck to Colorado, arriv- ing Monday evening Oct. 2. When he tried to start the truck on Tuesday morn- ing, it suffered a major failure of the power steering and braking systems. That delayed our unloading ef- forts for several hours, but in spite of the problems Tom was able to get the truck to the office site so the unloading could begin. Colorado MUFON members pitched in to make the unloading process go rapidly. More than 18,500 pounds of file cabinets, furniture, records and publications were placed in the new of- fice that day. The rest of the month was spent sorting, organizing, filing, hanging pictures, setting up displays, and getting the office ready for the open house on Oct. 29. MUFON has hundreds of processes, databases, and activities associated with running the International Headquarters in a timely and efficient manner. All of this has evolved over the 30 years that Walt held the position of International Director. Fortunately for me, Walt, Virginia, and the other Seguin staff members have been busy documenting what they did and how they did it. All of this information was included in three three- ring notebooks and sent to Colorado to help us under- stand what it takes to keep MUFON running. It will take some time for us to digest all the material we have received, but without it we could not operate MUFON in any semblance of order. A big thank you goes to the Seguin team for the thoughtful and expert job they did. New State Director Ernest T.
