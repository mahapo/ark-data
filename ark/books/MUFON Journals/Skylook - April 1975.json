The ,. di sco- tique Lotus., at Torrelavega, -is in full swing. So great is the crowd of customers that the barman, Manolo Aguera, in spite of being in the mil.itary ser- vice, has turned up at the stroke of midnight to help. He is stationed at the Engineers Academy at Burgos, and is en- joying a short leave which is- drawing to a close. . Shortly before k a.m. two companions of Manolo arrive at the .discotique: Ricardo Igle- sias and Felipe Sanchez. Both have passed New Years Eve at home and. regret having.to re- join the mi 1 i tary 1 ife so soon. Ricardo, a carpenter by pro- fession, has drunk only one glass of cognac; Felipe, a sheet metal worker in civilian life,, a bit of champagne. Be- fore leaving, Manolo takes a Coca-Cola, Ricardo a glass of orangeade, and Felipe a tonic. ON THE WAY The Mini 850, white with a red roof, gets going. Its owner, the barman, is driving it; at his side the carpenter ,.is seated. Behind, somewhat sleepy, rides the sheet metal worker. At k:kO a.m. at the crossing with the highway that goes to the town of Ontaneda, they pick up Jose Laso, another companion,, who has been wait- ing some time for them to ar- rive. Jose, somewhat younger than the other three since he is serving as a volunteer, gets in the back seat behind Manolo. \"LOOK, LOOK, LOOK\" At a moderate speed, the ve- hicle goes along the National 623 highway. They pass Puerto and about 15 kilo- Manolo decides to moments. He f and out of the car, wh i ch 'i s stretch del Escudo, meters later stop a few Ricardo get clean the windshield, somewhat dirty, arid Manolo u. no- thei r legs a bi t. ; It is then when tices the presence of \"a star which was shining more than 1 the others and was vibrating slightly.\" Ricardo\" will re- member that, although distant, it seemed lower than normal and that its flashes were \"between bluish and rosy.\" Felipe and Jose are dozing on the back seat. Ricardo and Manolo wake them up. For a short time the four watch the star, then con- tinue on their journey without giving it greater importance. The soldiers are running short of time. At least, they believe that, since they think that'reveilie will be at 7 a.m. In reality, the first day of Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the month being a holiday, it will be at 8 a.m. It is 6:25 a.m. when Manolo suddenly lifts his hand from the steering wheel and ex- claims: \"Look, look, look. I just saw something fall from the sky,\" describing a parabola at a great velocity. \"What is that?\" shouted Man- olo, braking to a dead halt. Then the four look and see a strange light light up, a light which from its intensity Ricar- do only will be capable of com- paring to \"that of the lamp tower at the football field at Sardinero.\" ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR LIGHTS It is 6:25 a.m. on the first day of January, 1975. Four soldiers who are returning from enjoying a leave have stopped 1*4 kilometers from Burgos, startled by a strange phenom- enon. They believe they are going to be late for reveille, but nevertheless can do nothing else but get down from the car. They cross to the other side of the highway and there watch for two minutes. At about ^00 meters (1200 feet) distance, relatively near the angle which National 632 forms with the highway that goes to Villarcayo, they con- template a luminous-body \"with the form of a truncated cone.\" They estimate it at about two meters (6 feet) in height—\"a man would fit in easily,\" will recall Manolo—by three meters (9 feet) in width. The strange object emits a yellowish light which gradually becomes white on the lower part until it ends in luminous jets which are directed toward the ground on which it has not com- pletely settled down. The attitudes of the soldiers are in opposition. Ricardo and Felipe declare themselves in favor of going closer. Manolo and Jose want to continue back to their base at all costs. Suddenly, the light goes out and, with hardly any lapse of time, another four light up Page 4 successively, exactly equally spaced with only a short dis- tance of separation between each one. \"Let's get back to the car,\" decides Manolo. The Mini 850 advances about fifty meters very slowly and a- gain stops. There is no fog, the sky is starry, and there the four luminous objects con- tinue to shine. Through the rear view mirror they see that another car has stopped about 800 meters behind them. A third vehicle, perhaps closer than any of them to the phenom- enon, is seen on the highway from Vi.l larcayo. The soldiers are afraid. \"I never had seen a man so ner- vous,\" Ricardo recalls, refer- ing to Manolo. Ricardo himself begins to weaken, and only Felipe insists timidly on in- vestigating what was occurring. \"DON'T LET THEM GET IN FRONT OF US\" \"Let's go, so that they don't get in. front of the car,\" shouts Manolo and attempts to start it. But it doesn't start. On the second attempt the car gives a jerk and starts up at great velocity. Through the windows, the soldiers continue observing the lights. Some trees interpose momentarily. They have not travelled even one kilometer when they get to the houses of the town of Quintanaortuno and they decide to stop for the thi rd time. Only two of the four lights remain. They get out of the car and they watch them for some- thing more than three minutes. Finally, considerably excited, they resume their trip toward Burgos. They recall the star which they saw before and they con- sider the possibility that some relation between the two phen- omena exists. They quickly discard such a hypothesis be- cause although they have con- tinued seeing the star for a considerable time the latter always seemed very distant. \"Let's see if it now happens that we will answer reveille on the moon,\" comments one of them in jest. A LARGE BLACK STAIN The Engineer's Academy is practically around the corner. A new problem confronts the companions: shall they or shall they not relate what they have seen when they arrive? Immedi- ately, they decide not to do it. \"They would only laugh at us\" they think. \"On a night like this and at an hour like 'J this the normal thing is that people would believe that we were drunk.\" But Manolo is confused; he always had thought that those who would say that they had seen UFO's were crazy. Now he has been personally involved in a strange experience. At the officer's bar he tells what happened to a friend who, like him, works as a waiter. • Manolo's friend speaks of it to an officer, and the latter communicates it to Major Llor- ente, assistant to the colonel, who is the director of the academy. Major Llorente speaks with Manolo and makes an ap- pointment with the four com- panions for one o'clock that -j afternoon. Having as a back- ground the climate of cordial- ity which prevails in the aca- 3,\\ demy, speaking is easy and the soldiers feel much better af-. ter having told all. An officer visits the zone of the incident, but he does not know the exact place and finds nothing. Simultaneously the academy gives a report of what had happened to the Cap- taincy General's Office. Days later, the Captaincy General will issue to the press an in- formative bulletin on the mat- ter. About four o'clock in the afternoon (January 1) Major Llorente and the four young men approach the exact spot where their vehicle stopped for the first time. From the highway"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"they point out the spot where they observed the lights, and immediately they begin to search the terrain. In some areas the earth is very moist. None of them had set foot there previously; Little by little they gradually approached the key point. Sud- denly, behind a line of bushes, they discover a large black spot (stain). The spot is in reality, a zone of burned grass. It is about thirty to forty meters long by four meters in width, with some clear spots in the interior, and has an aspect of having been burned very recently. Not a single additional stain was found in the hundreds of meters surrounding this area. Accord ing.to the farmers of the vicinity the most recent burn- ing of stubble had been done in the month of October. ANOTHER UFO? The speculations in regard to what was seen by Manolo, Ri- cardo, Felipe and Jose had their complement in the .news that at 11:30'p.m. on the night of the second day of January an officer and several soldiers saw another luminous object settle down on the firing range at Bardenas Reales located on the border between the prov- inces of Zaragoza and Navarra. (See February 1975 Skylook). \"The only thing that I can say,\" explains Major Llorente, \"is that these four young men .are completely trustworthy soldiers, and that they agree among themselves in all that they have related. In regard to what they saw...that is something that neither they nor I, nor perhaps anyone, knows.\" INFO convention set The 1975 International For- tean Organization (INFO) con- vention (Fortfest 75) will be Aug. 8, 9, and 10 at the Shera- ton-Oakbrook in Chicago, Paul Willis has announced. Pilot says compass affected As a result of the NBC-TV NEWS UFO Documentary \"UFO's Do You Believe?,\" Hugo W. Feugen, 53, the 'plant engineer for Conco, Inc. of Mendota, 111., called the director of MUFON to report the, following UFO ex- perience. On Nov. 28, 1974, while pil- oting his own Aeronca \"Champ\", aircraft from DeKalb'to Mendota at 11:^3 a.m. on a . bright day with visibi1ity limited to 6 or 7 miles due to haze, Feugen was flying at 2500 feet altitude with a compass bearing direc- tion of 2^0 degrees to compen- sate for a cross wind. As he passed over the small town of Shabbona, Ml., he 'was checking his position on the aeronautical map that he held in his lap to determine if he was still \"on course\" with vis- ual navigation to his destina- tion of Mendota. When he looked up from his map, he noticed with amazement that the magnetic compass on the panel of his older model Aeronca Champ number N82198 was rotating counter-clockwise at a rate of four .to five revolu- tions per minute. He immediate- ly became concerned for the radical behaviour of his com- pass because this was one of the few instruments in the air- craft used for navigational purposes. He looked to his right side and saw nothing but the town of Shabbona below him. When . he turned to his left, he saw.an object flying parallel to his aircraft at the same speed (ground speed 75 to 80 m.p.h.) and altitude, pacing him at 120 degrees at an estimated ' one quarter of a mile distance. He described the object as being shaped like a disc or an elipse. If it was one-fourth mile away, he estimated the size as 120 feet long and 30 feet thick. It appeared to be a solid object, white or dull silver in color, without any openings or protrusions. He said there may have been a de- pression on the top, but this angle was observed only for a brief second as it was depart- ing.  . '• After pacing him for eight to ten seconds, while the com- pass continued to spin, the ob- ject tipped slightly and he could observe that it was not an elipse, but was round in shape. \" - - As it tipped up on an angle, it accelerated to a fantastic -speed toward the east and was out of sight in the \"flick of the finger\" (less than one sec- ond). \".Feugen did not have his aircraft radio turned on, so there is no report of inter- ference with radio communica- tions. He did not have a cam- era, thus no photographs, were made.  ; . Until this report was made to MUFON, it had been given on- ly verbally to people at the Mendota Airport when he landed. Hugo has been a private ; pi lot for 3i years and was born in Holland. He speaks w ; i th a pleasant Dutch accent and ap- pears to be a knowledgeable en- gineer. He has given his verbal permission to use this report in SKYLOOK.    [ This report is significant in that not only was an unusual aerial object observed that could accelerate from about 80 miles per hour to some fantas- tic speed in less than one sec- ond, but it displayed a force that influenced the magnetic compass on the light plane dur- ing its proximity to the air- craft (electro-magnetic ef- fect). We have not been successful in obtaining a radar confir- mation of this report from Chi- cago, nor do we have any] other pilot or ground report coincid- ing with this, observation;. Feu- gen is very anxious to secure the names of other witnesses, as is MUFON.

BLUE LIGHT Students report close approach LOCATION: PHILLIPS ACADEMY, ANDOVER, MASS. DATE: FEB. 20, 1975 TIME: 9:00 p.m. TWO MAIN WITNESSES: MISS NANCY ROSE AND MISS HOPE SAUN- DERS . INVESTIGATED BY: JOHN GIAM- BRONE On the night of Feb. 20, 1975, at approx. 9 p.m., the two witnesses were sitting on a small stone wall, which is on campus. The two girls were just talking and stargazing when they noticed what at first ap- peared to be a plane about to crash. Their distance at this point was approx. 1200 ft. The object was about a 20 degree angle off ground level. The object seen was going straight down in the western sky, in the direction of the far side of the campus soccer field. At a point just above the tree top level it stopped and went straight up and stopped at an angle of approx. ^0 degrees. It then moved very slowly (much slower than an airplane) toward the direction of the campus in- firmary (north)o While this was happening the girls were hurrying across cam- pus to the near side of the soccer- field. At this point they were 200-250 ft. away from the object. They could only determine a blue light on \"top\" and a multiple of red lights \"below.\" The two girls stopped beside a large oak tree (approx. 50 ft. high). At this point the object stopped its northward movement and came directly to- ward them, gradually reducing its altitude,, The object stop- ped directly overhead so that the girls were looking straight up at it. The object was estimated to be 10-12 ft. in diameter, with a dull grey surface and at a height half again as high as the oak tree, which places the object at approx. 75 ft. off the ground. The object remained . at this position for 30-60 sec- *• onds. The object emitted a very soft hum, much like that of a small electric motor, and dur- ing the time it remained over- head it exhibited a \"rocking motion.\" Both girls said that the bottom of the object was round and convex in shape, al- though they could not see any sharp definite outline of its perimeter. Miss Rose indicates that while the object was overhead she could see a blue light on top of the object which was of less intensity than the red light or lights that were on the lower section; she was not sure if the red light was one large light or a multiple of smaller lights. She did say Page 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"that the red light being emitt- ed was much larger and brighter than the blue. Miss Saunders indicates that when she saw the object across the soccer field she did see a blue as well as a red light, but when the object was d-irect- ly overhead all she could see were multiple red lights. The girls both said that they were terrifeid while the object was overhead. After the 30-60-second period was over, the object \"backed up\" (toward the west-N-west) about a dis- tance of 20-25 ft. and then moved off to the left in a large semi-circular pattern (toward the south-southeast and east). The object moved slowly to- ward the area of the bell tower (located on campus). Both girls said that the object passed be- low the top of the bell tower (estimated height of the tower 65 ft.), . and then disappeared in the southern .sky. The ob- ject appeared again about 10 minutes later, from the same general direction, but at a greater distance from when it was lost from view. By this time the, girls were able to contact other students who were elsewhere on campus grounds and they too were able to see the red and blue lights in the distant sky. The object kept appearing and disappearing for the next one and a half hours and was seen by .a total of 15 students (most names on file). At 9:20 p.m. one of these other students, David Greef, reported.the UFO to the Andover Police, who dispatched patrol car #3 to investigate, but the officers reported see- ing no unusual activity in .the sky that evening. At approx. 9:^5 that evening (i hr 0 after reporting UFO to police) a helicopter appeared over the campus and was flying at rather low altitudes. A number of,, students, saw this helicopter, but were unable to observe any markings on the craft. On March 5th and 6th, calls were made by this investigator to the Andover Police, Coast Guard Headquarters in Boston, the Andover State Police bar- racks, State Police Headquan- ters in Boston, and the Norwood State. Police Helicopter Base. On March 11th at 9:10 a.m. a call was placed to Fort Devens (Massachusetts), a NG Army Camp that has helicopters based there. This call was placed by Raymond Fowler (MUFON director of investigations). He also called .(at 9:**5 a.m. same date) WBZ a Boston-based radio sta- tion that has a traffic control helicopter which is based in Beverly, Mass, (a few miles from Andover). All the above calls . placed to these different agencies were answered in the negative. They all denied any knowledge of any helicopter activity in that area on the night in ques- tion. Efforts are still con- tinuing to ascertain the origin of this helicopter. On five subsequent nights (2/26-2/27-2/28-3/2-3/3, 1975) unusual lights performing.er- ratic manuevers were seen by at least two students. One witness was able to take photographs of an unusual pbr ject.over the campus during the period in. question; however, due to an early spring vacation at Phi 11ips Academy, the school has closed down until March 26th. As soon as the school re- opens efforts will be made to obtain a , more detailed account of the sightings of these two individuals, as well as any photographic evidence that they might have. Subsequent reports wi 11 follow. . .Miss Rose and Miss Saunders appeared to this investigator to be two very level-headed 17- year-old girls. , They appeared to be honest, and • sincere in their reports of the sighting. At no time did l : get the im- pression that they exaggerated their story. I came away.from the interview with the distinct feeling that the two. girls-had seen something that was totally foreign to their concept of any known flying craft. ' J. Santangelo, for Massachu- . Comments by MUFON director setts: Although there are some dis- crepencies between witnesses' descriptions, this is a com- prehensive report from j Field Investigator Giambrone. ; This certainly can be classed! as an Unknown Flying Object and a Close Encounter. ' .''••• '•' If the investigator is able to obtain the negatives of the pictures that were taken and they are of sufficiently good quality they will be forwarded subsequently.   , When I spoke to the invest!-' gator' over the-phone he men- tioned that the girls indicated the object was 10 to 12 feet in. diameter and that the light source seemed to be . about a foot and a half, -in .diameter. Although this does not appear in his report, the size of the. light source is unusual.

Otherwise, I would have seen the object not in the shape of a circular.arc but in the shape of.an arc of an el 1ipse. \"Secondly, as the object moved away, the luminous cres- cent surface was transformed into a vertical band of light which then disappeared. \"From all of this I assume that the unidentified flying object had a crescent-shaped form with a triangular -cross section. Let me note several details: \"After my observation of the object's flight .1 could hear the rumble of the engines of a transport or passenger plane somewhere in the distant sky. \"The next day, that is on Sept. .20, a taxi driver .(I have the number of the vehicle) told me that on the previous day (Sept. 19) he was near Zhdanov, (formerly Mariupol) and . at a time, as he put it, 'when it was already^ dark but the moon was not yet visible\" he saw the flight of a round flying nude-, us .type object. In flying, the object sparkled strongly in the tail portion. The taxi driver stressed that the object\"was flying toward Donetsk.

Not .that'the implica- tions of UFOs aren't—or might not be—serious, -but, as in all aspects of life, Ufologists need a sense of humor too.

And don't let that title mislead you; Clem- ents isn't poking fun at either UFOs or the people who investi- gate them. For that matter, he has also been researching the subject for many years, so he knows whereof he speaks. As he says in his opening chapter: \"The approach is lighthearted and perhaps lightheaded. The intent, however, is serious and the basic facts, though syn- thesized and dramatized, are not fictionalized.\" I got many a chuckle out of the book and I think you will also.

Allen Hynek has been printed in the February issue of the prestigious FBI LAW ENFORCEMENT BULLETIN, which has a circula- tion of 80,000. The article explains the role which law enforcement officers can play in reporting UFO sightings to the Center via a special toll-free number.. Dr. Hynek also presents a general picture of the UFO scene, em- phasizing the Increasing accep- tance of. UFOs as a suitable 'subject of study by scientists. Discussing some misconcep- tions about the UFO phenomenon, Hynek dealt with the charge that reports are made by crack- pots. \"The facts are quite other- wise,\" he pointed out. .\"Clear- ly, pol ice off icers , commerci.al and military pilots, air traf- fic controllers, scientists, and school teachers are not in this category. Experience def- initely shows that the best re- ports, those with the greatest information content, come from technically trained, profes- sional people, especially law enforcement personnel.\" . Dealing with the misconcep- tion that UFO. witnesses have \"overstimulated imaginations,\" Hynek stated, \"The reports themselves argue strongly a- gainst-this, for the reports do not range over a broad spec- trum. \"There are virtually no.re- ports of .unidentified SAILING objects, or. of UFOs.with wings or wheels, and there are no re- ports of flying, pink elephants (FPEs), or of the Empire State Building being seen upside.down in Pittsburgh....Pure imagina- tion should produce all sorts of things—but concerning UFOs, it does not....Our most puzzl- ing reports come from reliable, often .highly-trained, witness- Discussing the misconception that \"people see what they want to see.\" Dr. Hynek explained that \"once again, experience denies this.

A preliminary assessment, indi- cates that about 71 percent were \"nocturnal lights,\" 17 percent were listed as '/close encounters\" (within 500 feet), 8 percent were daylight discs, and k percent were uncategor- ized. The Center has noted,' how- ever, that these preliminary designations often change after the reports are investigated.

We soon had to realize the \"snail feeler\" sightings of October and November, 1973, were only one piece for the jig-saw—no isolated phenomena. A statistical breakdown with the deadline of March 2, 1975, i.e. after our 6th field trip for MUFON-C.E.S., indicates al- most permanent activity since August, 1973, with 29 different sighting reports and 5k objects involved. On 2*» occasions shapes or structural details were observ- ed, and two Type-I sightings have been recorded. Details on the salient points of interest will be translated in May, so let's keep to the outlines here: In August, 1973, on two suc- cessive evenings near Spiel- berg, a globe projecting beams of \"solid light\" was observed by the owner of a car service station. The same witness saw a ball travelling at supersonic speed in early September, and watched a pulsating object which released two \"satellites\" some days later. All objects showed vivid colors which changed in a clockwise pattern, apparently. On December 28, 1973, the Pritz family at Traunstein noticed a fiery mass manoever- ing in the WSW sky at impos- sible speed. Gerhard Pritz re- ported a red egg with a red spotlight cone projecting down- wards and illuminating trees in late January, 197^. In July and August, 197 1 *, manoevers similar to the October, 1973, Page 16 ones, but always with three globes in operation and without \"feelers\" occurred in the Traunstein sky. Hans Pritz and Mr. L., local department store owner, were the main witnesses. The Spielberg witness watch- ed a pulsating globe following a spiral trajectory, over the swamp region to the northwest in August. Nothing new until November, when a low-flying cigar or oblong object with a yellow-orange and red light crossed the road in front of the Pritz car in the evening of the 18th. Gerhart and Hans Pritz gave us an impressive ac- count of this small low-flyer, which kept only 50 meters above ground level. On Dec. 9, a disc flashing vivid colors was .observed through binoculars by the L. family; 5 days later Mr. Pritz saw a fuzzy globe with a rotat- ing beacon light and a red dot flying away from it on his way to Kaltenbach. Three days be- fore Christmas Eve, 197**, three globes with \"peaks\" hovered near Traunstein, and a winging ball emitted sparks near a small town in Southern Wald- viertel (possible Type-l). A huge globe with multi- colored rays resembling \"clock- hands\" was seen from Mr. Pritz's uncle's near the Pritz house in January this year; Hans-Pritz focused his binocu- lars onto a flickering object close to the ground three days later, and on Jan. 13 a bizarre shape shot down a fiery ray in- to the woods behind Mt. Wacht- stein. A flyover of a cigar and three red discs was noticed on the 15th. On Jan. 17 and 27, classical \"dogfights\" were watched close- ly by Hans Pritz and his uncle. On March 1, 1975, Ernst Berger and one of his investigators observed the clear sky together with the Pritz family and saw nothing unusual. At 7:30 p.m. CET Hans Pritz left the group and drove to Zwettl together with three friends. It was not until March 2, 1975, that we learned the four persons had encountered a huge oval \"burn- ing, red\" object \"just over the treetops\" on their way to Zwettl, near Grossweissenbach. Also, three yellowish globes \"composed of many parts, like a puzzle\" were noticed near the cigar-shaped light source. The somewhat dramatic Type-l had happened around 7:50 p.m. The case is still under investiga- tion and will be published .by Skylook together with a detail- ed report on the other Traun- stein sightings. I have to add that I delib- erately did not follow Dr. Hynek's suggestion to exclude UFO reporters with a \"repeater aspect\" from my studies, but have taken the Pritz and Mr. L. reports at face value. In our statistical breakdown, the average number of observers per observation proved to be 2.2 and kO minutes were the average observation time. There can be no doubt something very strange is going on over the lonely woods of Northern Austria. (Copyright by Ernst Berger, 1975) The Bible and Flying Saucers by Dr. Barry H.

Graber's previous artistic contributions to SKYLOOK have included the sketch of Soviet UFO expert Dr. Felix Zigel on the January cover,- a sketch which reportedly' won praise from Dr. Zigel himself. . The new staff artist is currently working on special designs for regular columns in the magazine, as well as pos- sible cover designs. One of his sketches also accompanies this month's \"Behind the Iron Curtain\" article. A state-section director for Henry and Jefferson counties in Iowa, Graber says he has been interested in the implications of UFOs for many years. In ad-; dition to his strong interests in the visual aspects of the UFO phenomenon, he says he is also interested in the related areas of optical and radio as- tronomy, exobiology, communi- cations theory, bio-cybernet- ics, advanced power systems, and state-of-the-art technol- ogy. Graber says he is \"an amateur artist still exploring tech- niques,\" while his main in- terest remains in free compo- sition and technical illustra- tion. He hopes to continue his cept for the evening dinner. Individual sessions and dinner will total $17.00; however, an advance reservation for the en- tire symposium is only $15.00.

Each state, state-section director, and most consultants have received a letter from the Center for UFO Studies signed by J.. Allen Hynek reiterating the cooperative investigative network arrangement that exists between the Center and MUFON. Also enclosed was an intro- ductory letter addressed to \"Dear Chief,\" which explains the Center for UFO Studies and the toll free number which may be used by police agencies to report UFO sightings directly to the Center. Since state- section directors are responsi- ble for several counties, they may have a large number of cit- ies and villages, each having their own police departments, in addition to each county sheriff. It is recommended that the letter from the Center be reproduced in volume to meet your needs for each agency. In addition to the letter from the Center, each director should compose a short concise letter describing the local MUFON organization, giving the names, addresses and telephone number to be called to report UFO sightings. These two let- ters will help to establish a rapport between the police agencies and the local MUFON representatives when they are delivered personally to the chief of police or sheriff. In communities where local MUFON groups or representatives are well organized, the police in some cities have indicated that they would prefer to refer the cases directly to MUFON people. Wider distribution of the toll-free number to county sheriffs and police departments in areas where MUFON is not presently organized will ulti- mately bring UFO reports to the attention of the Center for UFO Studies that are now being un- reported and thus not available for investigation and study. This recommended local ar- rangement thus provides prompt response to reports, which if telephoned -to the Center, would be referred back to the nearest state or state-section director for investigation. The close cooperation between MUFON and. the Center for UFO Studies is another fine example of the united effort being displayed to help resolve the UFO enigma. 1974 MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS \"UFO's-—An Issue Whose Time Has Almost Come\" By Ralph Blum \"Religion and UFO's: The Extra- sensory Problem\" by Barry H.

Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Recapping and commenting By Richard Hall (This column is directed to- wards articles appearing in the February, 1975, edition of SKY- LOOK) . Perhaps I should be awarded a set of horns for playing the Devil's advocate, but various aspects of the \"Creature Inside Shield of Light\" case (October 21, 1973) bother me as to its interpretation. Only Len Stringfield's fine report makes it possible for me to second-guess, but I am sure Len would agree that persistent and critical questioning is necessary in \"messy\" cases of this type. I also know from experience that follow-up in- vestigations can be difficult, and nagging questions frequent- ly remain. Len has established that various conventional visual stimuli were present in the general area that could have confused the issue of whether a UFO was there—3 fire engines and a ladder truck, a disabled vehicle whose occupants sought help to get it started, a sec- ong vehicle used to jump the battery of the fFrst, and a police scout car. In the midst of this \"heavy traffic,\" we have one witness-- Mrs. R.H., who was aware of the UFO wave then in progress—who reported an ape-like creature behaving like a robot within a bell-jar-like dome of light. (The son, Carl, reports only seeing the battery-jumping ac- tivity and a bright light be- yond the parked car, not the creature. He seems so unim- pressed that he goes back to bed). It is entirely possible that Mrs. R.H. did observe something anomalous, and there are enough coincidental aspects such as the tripped fire alarm to leave Page 20 this an open questi'on. However, it is also note- worthy that there is no UFO be- havior described in the report --no \"craft\" seen either land- ing or taking off. the report content is apparition-Like rather than UFO-like. The fol- lowing questions also remain. Anyone who has ever tried to jump a battery at night and get the right cables on the right terminals must wonder how this could be done without light (page 5), Does the Swallen warehouse have a guard, and if so where was he at the time? What was the boyfriend!s occupation at the time, and could it have been related to the floor tile fragments? When the car back- fired, could it have expelled carbon particles and exhaust wastes contributing to the de- bris found? Analysis of the physical samples might shed Tight on the possibilities of exhaust wastes, corrosion scraped from battery terminals, and the presence of flares or fireworks (teenage highjinks?). It might also help to have the occupants of the two cars describe step-by-step exactly what they did before and during the battery-jump ing procedure, starting with their arrival at the parked car. I have no idea what Mrs. R. H. saw, but a process of elim- ination might establish what she did not see. MUFON-C.E.S. is a welcome addition to the fold, and their reports to date have been im- pressive in quality. Some read- ers may have been puzzled, as I was, by the geological descrip- tion of the Austrian-Bavarian border area as having a \"Karst morphology.\" My dictionary de- stronomy Notes By Mark Herbs*riW May Sky Mercury—is at greatest east- ern elongation on the 16th and this is a favorable elongation.
