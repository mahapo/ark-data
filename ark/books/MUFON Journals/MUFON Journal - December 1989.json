Datelined both Voronezh and Mos- cow, the article was written by Lev Aksyonov and Boris Zverev. A usual urban landscape: a busy street, a residential neighborhood, kindergartens, a meadow on the edge of a park. Here, in Voronezh's Levoberezhny District, near Mende- leyev Street, as eyewitnesses say, mysterious occurrences were ob- served approximately between September 21 and October 2. At first journalists drew primarily on eyewitness accounts by adolescents — pupils of Secondary School No. 33 nearby. But enthusiasts in Voronezh who have come together to study ab- normal atmospheric phenomena at the Alexander Popov radioelectronics and communications scientific- technical association are also taking an active interest in this. They have talked to eyewitnesses, quite a number of adults among them, and carried out the first studies on the site where the \"extraterrestrials\" are sup- posed to have landed. By questioning each of the witnesses separately, they produced — on the basis of stories from peo- ple excited at what they had seen (or imagined?) — not only a detailed pic- ture of the events, but also sketches of the appearance of the UFO and the \"pilots.\" It is significant that descrip- tions of the aliens and their flying craft amazingly coincide with what was observed in early June of this year by the inhabitants of the Konantsevo village in the Kharovsk District (Vologda Region). However, an eyewitness account is one thing, the objective readings of in- struments is something different. On the site of the UFO's supposed land- ing numerous dents were found in the soil which could have been made by the \"saucer's feet.\" Their diameter is EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS 25-30 cm, their depth from 20 to 25 cm. The \"unofficial\" enthusiasts say that, according to their calculations, the approximate mass of the body which exerted pressure on the ground in this spot was 11 tons. But, more interesting, in some of the dents the \"incorruptible\" dosimeters recorded a definite in- crease in the background of gamma- radiation in comparison with neighboring sites some two-three metres away. Whereas the usual level here amounts to 10-15 microroentgen an hour, in one of the dents they recorded 30, and in another — 37 microroentgen an hour (it was this particular dent that Vladimir Cherkizov, senior expert of the Voronezh Administration of Internal Affairs, photographed). Specialists are not concerned about such radiation, as it poses no threat to people's health. Prudence, how- ever, is always welcome. \"Such things mustn't be taken too lightly,\" we were told by a spokesman for the local Ad- ministration of the USSR State Security Committee at the site of the event. \"We must accumulate informa- tion on any abnormal phenomena, wherever they take place, and careful- ly study them. This is primarily a task for scientists. For the time being, at the first stage, the investigation was main- ly carried out by enthusiasts. We are here to take steps — if necessary — to ensure citizens' safety.\" During our two days in Voronezh we met with many representatives from the city and regional authorities. The city's Mayor, Victor Atlasov, played an active part in organizing research, along with his first deputy, Alexander Tsapin, the leaders of the Voronezh Administration of Internal Affairs, ranking officials of the regional Party committee, including Valery Deryabin, head of its socioeconomic department. On October 12, at the in- itiative of Gennady Kabasin, first secretary of the regional committee of the CPSU, people's deputy of the USSR, a competent commission was set up, with scientists, criminologists, medics, meteorologists and enthusiasts-UFOlogists as its members. But let us return to the South Park. There was everthing here — serious work by experts and crowds of curious people, both those who believed in the \"aliens\" and sceptics. There was even an excursion — we saw a bus drive in, bringing a group of voca- tional school pupils who longed to see everything with their own eyes. And Voronezh, with a population of nearly a million, was filled with rumors. Some even said that the Father Superior of one of the Orthodox churches sanctified that place and believers now come to the park to pray. We contacted the Voronezh diocese. \"This doesn't come from God, this is the work of Satan. A real Christian will never go to pray there,\" was the peremptory reply. When still on our way from Moscow, we wondered how to find eyewitnesses of the events as quickly as possible. We were preparing for the most difficult \"operation,\" but everything turned out to be much simpler. As soon as we came to the park, we were surrounded by a flock of children. \"Are you journalists? Will you question witnesses?\" \"We would like to,\" we replied. \"But where can we find them?\" \"We're the witnesses and we'll tell you everything,\" cried the boys, their eyes burning, excited. Despite the fact that classes were go- ing on in the nearby school, the \"friends of the aliens\" seemed to have temporarily resettled on the \"UFOdrome\": classes could wait a little. Denis Murzenko, Yura Grinev, Yura Sergachev, Roman Milkin, Zhenya Blinov, now called a \"TV star\" for giv- ing an interview to central TV, and many others vied with one another in giving interviews to the press. Col- leagues appeared — from Kom- somolskaya Pravda and the Novosti MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Press Agency. All the stories coincide in the main: the flyover and landing of a mysterious ellipsis-shaped body about 15 by 6 m with a hatch in the middle was seen from various distances. The object remained at a height of roughly 1.5 m above earth, then supports came out and it landed. From the open hatch there emerged a three-metre-tall figure which filled the whole of the \"doorway.\" Distinc- tive features: a heavy gait, no neck (the \"head,\" with something like three luminous eyes, was a kind of hemis- phere lying directly on the shoulders). The alien — sometimes there were a few of them — walked near the craft for some time, examined the plot, and seemed to take soil samples. This is what the boys told us (and not us alone). And the adults? We have no doubts that the children did not invent all of this. Incidentally, the same view is held by Mayor Viktor Atlasov, who carefully studied the video recording with the boys' very first \"testimonies.\" \"I am not a young person and, you know, an adult can always tell when a child is telling the truth and when he is not. I believe the boys,\" he ad- mitted in a conversation with us. We found grown-up witnesses of repeated cases of flyovers, even land- ings, by UFOs. Thus, Lieutenant of the Militia Sergei Matveyev, whom we im- mediately took to, said that on September 27, at about 7 p.m., he was walking in the area of the park. Suddenly Sergei noticied a luminous ball sweeping past northwards at a colossal speed, strictly horizontally and at an altitude of roughly 200 m. He estimated its diameter to be about 15 m. He watched the ball's flight for about 5 seconds. The object moved noiselessly. \"Couldn't it have been a mirage, some light spot, the play of light in the atmosphere?\" \"No,\" he confidently replied. \"The body was clearly multi- dimensional.\" The lieutenant's first reaction was interesting: he decided not to tell his acquaintances and col- leagues at once. \"They might have thought: a militiaman doesn't have such fancies...\" Sergei Matveyev made up his mind only when the local press urged the city's inhabitants to report 1. On September 23, at 9 p.m., I was returning home and saw a red round object with a black hatch the size of a door in the sky. It was about five metres in diameter. At the moment of landing four legs were ejected, whereupon the hatch opened and a \"robot\" drove down the ladder. (From a story by the author of the sketches, Roma Torshin, a sixth-former of School No. 33, Voronezh.) 2. On September 26 or 27 (the boy doesn't remember exactly), at 7 p.m. and in the same place, Zhenya Blinov, a classmate of Roma Torshin, saw an object with por- tholes. Someone about three metres tall emerged from it. \"On his head,\" the boy describes, \"I saw two eyes and slightly above them a red lamp. On his breast there was a disk with three spots of different colours, and slightly below it there was a rectangle which started sticking out from the body.\" Zhenya drew the \"extraterrestrials' ship\" and its \"crew.\" 3. The head of an extraterrestrial was depicted by Oleg Chebotaryov, a third former of School No. 33 in Voronezh, who in the last days of September went with other boys to the place where \"saucers\" had been landing. The boy was lucky — he also witnessed the landing of a saucer 8-10 metres in diameter. He remembers that the \"hairs\" on the creature's head were of dif- ferent colours: light-blue, red and navy blue. any strange things they might have seen. It must be said that his superiors took the young officer's story in real earnest. We also spoke to two women witnesses. On September 29, at 7 p.m., Olga Poludneva, an assembler at a local industrial plant, saw a luminous ball flying at a great altitude in the openings between houses. Ac- cording to her, the flight lasted about 10 minutes. Her friend Lyudmila Kupriyanova said that she was at home at that moment, and she heard cries outdoors: \"A saucer is flying!\" She ran into the, street and only managed to see a luminous tail from the mysterious body. There were many people near the house, everyone greatly excited by what they had seen. It is characteristic that for some time afterwards many witnesses of the mysterious phenomenon experienced an inexplicable feeling of fear and unusual sensations: heaviness in their feet and restraint in movements. But these are only emotions. Now comes the turn of profes- sionals. We spoke several times with a person of immense charm, whose objectivity cannot be doubted — her profession precludes any bias. Col- onel of the Militia Lyudmila Makarova, head of the criminal exper- tise deparmtent of the Voronezh Ad- ministration of Internal Affairs, headed a group of experts who took measurements on the site of the event and examined it closely. \"I don't know what exactly happened here, but an increase in the radioactive back- ground is in evidence. The reason? Maybe a grain of some isotope got in here. Then one more question: why precisely in the dent, why not on the surface? We shall be able to answer everything only after thorough in- vestigation.\" Thus, a highly competent comis- sion is at work in the city. Taking part in it is the cream of local science, specialists in the most diverse fields, and officials. We met with Professor Stanislav Kadmensky, D.Sc., head of the nuclear physics chair at Voronezh University, who is a member of the commission. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"2-1 The professor told us that 17 soil samples had been taken in the area of the supposed landing. Since the question is extremely urgent, ten workers of the chair led by him neglected the Labour Code and worked on the available samples both on Saturday and Sunday. Doubt does not amount to nega- tion. Speaking about the possiblity of aliens appearing on our planet, Stanislav Kadmensky remarked: \"If extraterrestrials are a reality, and if they are really inhabitants of distant worlds lying oustide the confines of our Solar System, the very fact of their arrival imparts colossal optimism to physicists. If it has been proved that such flights are possible, the recogni- tion of their reality will entail the need to reconsider conclusions from the special theory of relativity. It means that there is another physics, which is still unknown to us.\" We were promised the commis- sion's final document. We continue keeping track of the development of events. Current Case Log By Dan Wright Wright is MUFON's deputy direc- tor of investigations. The following summarizes case reports received from late July through September which are well prepared and represent recent events of significance to ufology. Unless otherwise indicated, all incidents oc- curred at night, and no sound, odor or vibration was detected. Log # 890712. (11/9/88 event near Maylene, Alabama); in- vestigators Jeff and Karen Ballard. Returning from a friend's home, a woman noticed blinking lights to her right. On rounding a curve, she spot- ted an oblong metallic object ahead, perhaps 40 feet in diameter. It displayed two bright white lights on the perimeter, four smaller yellow- white lights surrounding a circular area on the bottom, and a dark raised portion (\"hump\") on either side. Seeming to hover momentarily, the object then rose and glided over the woman's car into the distance. As it did so, she felt disjointed consciously from her physical surroundings, believing afterward that she watched it from an elevated viewing angle as it left. Log # 890714. (3/15/89 event near Elysian, Minnesota); investigator Bill McNeff. While driving home a woman came upon a 30-foot display of lights hovering about 50 feet over the ditch. She came to a halt and watched for several minutes but discerned only lights. They consisted of two rows of alternating red and green, blinking in succession, and two red lights above. Becoming fright- ened, she drove a short distance to the home of a friend. They returned but found nothing. Log # 890719. (5/17/89 event in a suburb of Pittsburg, PA); investigator Evelyn Schurman. Two women were driving on a residential street when they noticed an oval shape with beacon-sized red lights along the side, hovering in the near distance. The ob- ject retreated and returned several times over two minutes, then ac- celerated vertically. They filed a police report immediately. Log # 890802. (7/16/89 event in New Harmony, Indiana); investigator Francis Ridge. A woman was standing outside when her driveway and sur- roundings were illuminated \"as bright as day.\" Overhead at treetop level was a disc of satellite dish proportion. Dozens of short rods or cylinder shapes protruded in varying lengths and colors from its white-lit concave underside. After a few moments, it moved beyond nearby trees and out of sight. Log # 890803. (7/18/89 event in Dutton, Alabama); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A couple had re- treated inside due to threatening weather when an acquaintance (of reputed psychic ability) phoned to say they should be looking for UFOs. Returning outside, the sky was total- ly clear. Moments later, they observed an oval white light moving slowing past in the distance. Ten minutes later, the thunderstorm ensued. [Notes: The wife may have experienced a bedroom intrusion by a cloaked figure later that night. She had numerous experiences, alone and with others, of a triangular object in connection with the Fyffe, Alabama sightings.] Lot # 890806. (8/13/89 event in Mansura, Louisiana); investigator Barney Garner. At 10:30 AM, a man noticed a 2-3 foot disc floating just off the ground 30 feet away on his pro- perty. He called to his wife. After moving a short distance and hover- ing several times, it shot up vertical- ly, circled a nearby tree, then ac- celerated angularly up and out of sight. A police report was filed. [Note: The object reportedly left swirled circles of weeds which had been mowed before the investigator arrived.] Log # 890903. (5/18/89 event in Vancouver, B.C.); investigator Michael Strainic. Over the course of an hour, a man and woman observed three formations of brilliant, disc-like objects undulating within a vapor, and two formations of dull grey discs, each with a raised center. Each formation was visible for several seconds and MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"travelling at a high rate in a straight- line path. Log # 890904. (March 1988 event in Gulf Breeze, Florida); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A teen was sent outside to find the cause of a humming sound. At treetop level, a flat-bottomed disc passed slowly and directly overhead. The undercarriage was black in the center with concen- tric rings, the inner composed of white squares of light, the outer of larger and alternately white and orange squares that flashed sequentially. He called to his mother, who arrived in time to see the object moving away. [Note: The mother and son related other sightings over the past two years as well as high-strangeness events in earlier years.] Log # 890905. (4/4/89 event in Pensacola, Florida); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. While driv- ing in the city, a woman felt a strong energy, then observed a huge glow- ing ball of light pass low and quickly overhead. The car radio was knocked off its station. [Note: The woman also reported a bedroom intrusion by a dark figure several years ago, and her toddler related the same figure in his bedroom recently.] Log # 890906. (8/23/89 event in Navarre Beach, Florida); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A couple viewing stars from their balcony were among those who observed a tri- angular formation over the bay. The display comprised two huge red lights 150 feet apart at each apex and two centered yellow-white lights. No outline was discerned. The lights stop- ped, then moved off and out of sight. Log # 890808. (8/22/89 event in Pensacola Beach, Florida); in- vestigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A woman's housemate phoned to say that customers at his establishment were reporting unusal lights in the sky. From her balcony over the next two hours, she observed numerous light anomalies along with huge unlighted objects of undefined shape approach- ing each other from opposite direc- tions, hovering together, then retreating to their original points. Log # 890910. (8/22/89 event in Gulf Breeze, Florida); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. From her backyard, a woman noticed a \"translucent white\" triangular object (50-100 feet to a side) hovering at a vertical attitude over trees within 100 yards. After a moment it rose, levell- ed off and moved over a nearby bridge, then began to return. She called her teenage son outside who observed a large globe of light (color not recalled) at each apex and small red lights along the three sides before it passed out of view. Log # 890911. (8/23/89 event in Gulf Breeze, Florida); investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. Two women in their driveway observed a \"silver or white\" delta-shaped object (estimated 70 feet per side) pass low and almost directly overhead. On the leading apex was a globe or cluster of white lights 12-16 feet in diameter. Globes or clusters of red were at the other apexes. Three lights - one white and two red - followed closely behind. After trying to follow in their car, the women drove to a friend's home. There, they saw the same or similar object and lights pass nearby. This time, two independent lights (now pulsating) led the vehicle as it moved slowly out of sight. Again they tried unsuccessfully to follow. Log # 890912. (12/15/88 near Shelton, Washington); investigator James Clarkson. From their secluded lakeside home, a family was attracted outside by a brilliant approaching light illuminating the trees below. They observed three black boomerangs, the first estimated variously from 75 feet at the base to a \"a football field,\" move very slowly overhead at treetop level. The latter two were identical in shape but much smaller. The wife attempted a flash photo, but neither prints nor negatives were returned. In Others' Voids By Lucius Parish The November issue of FATE reports on Kansas physician Scott Corder's pro- blems which have come about through his support of a \"contactee\" case. Cor- der's medical license has been suspended as a result of his activities in promoting messages and prophecies received from \"extraterrestrials.\" Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard, known to Ufologists for his massive study of UFO abduction cases, has turned his attention to UFO flaps (or \"waves\"). D. Scott Rogo reports on some of Bullard's findings in the \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" section of October OMNI. In the November issue of OMNI, the theories of Zecharia Sitchin are examined. Sitchin feels his informa- tion on conditions in the outer solar system is confirmed by Voyager 2's recent fly-by of Neptune. The three most recent books published by Wendelle Stevens are UFO CON- TACT: THE FOUR by Scott Corder & Donna Butts (240 pages; $17.95), UFO CONTACT FROM THE PLEIADES: SUPPLEMENTARY INVESTIGATON REPORT (533 pages; $29.95) and UFO CONTACT FROM RETICULUM: UP- DATE (444 pages; $18.95). If you're in- terested in the controversy mentioned in the first paragraph above, the Corder & Butts book will fill you in. For those who have followed either the Meier or Bill Herrmann cases, the two additional volumes will be welcome news. All books may be ordered from: UFO BOOKS - Christine Stevens-Cox - P.O.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"20 Witnesses View UFO Over Pensacola by Walt Andrus and Gary Watson On Tuesday, September 12, 1989 at 7:55 p.m., 20 people, including 12 MUFON investigators, sighted a red glowing object in the sky when they were called out of their monthly meeting at the Unity Church in Pen- sacola, Florida. When first observed by Edward Walters as he drove his pickup truck into the church parking lot, the object or red glowing light was moving from east to west toward the church. The red glow was eliptical in shape, hovered for several minutes in a \"boiling motion\" without noise, before beginning its accent toward the east. Ed retrieved his instamatic camera with 200 ASA color print film from his truck and made two photographs of the red glowing light with a bright yellow center. He immediately ran in- to the meeting and asked Gary Wat- son to come outside to the parking lot to see the lighted object. When Gary viewed the glow, he asked Ed to bring Donald M. Ware, Florida State Direc- tor, outside also. The monthly Pen- sacola UFO meeting was interrupted when Ed asked everyone to adjourn to the parking lot where all 20 peo- ple had an opportunity to view the UFO. They all watched as the reddish light made its accent into the broken cloud cover. After seven minutes in- to the sighting the red light could no longer be seen. When Don Ware first saw the red- dish light, it was about 45 degrees above the horizon at a azimuth of about 80 degrees. It appeared sta- tionary and about as bright as the brightest planet (Venus). It then began to dim and brighten as if the thin cloud layer was passing in front of it. The clouds were reported by the weather bureau as thin scattered cir- rus at 25,000 feet. Five or six minutes later, Don reported seeing a brighter white light at about 55 degrees above the horizon moving from the direction of the reddish one toward the west northwest. It too was apparently obscured by clouds. Both lights were not seen simultaneously. Gary Watson immediately initiated an investigation with a sighting reenactment that was documented the following night at the same time. Using Ed's Instamatic 110 camera and 200 ASA film, test shots were taken of different known objects to establish distances and illumination. A test photo of the full moon shows its im- age to be twice as large as the UFO's image but not nearly as bright. The size of the image on the two 110 photos was 1.4 and 1.9 mm respec- tively. The image appears to be the reddish veil surrounding a yellowish core of the Gulf Breeze type 2 object, similar to the one photographed on January 16, 1988. It was somewhat embarrassing that none of the 12 investigators or other attendees had a 35mm camera available at the meeting. After Ed's ex- periences, starting on November 11, 1987, he is seldom caught without a camera readily available. This multiple-witness sighting may be a first in UFO history that involves such a large number of trained MUFON field investigators plus the MUFON Eastern' Regional Director, Donald M. Ware and Charles D. Flannigan, Florida State Section Director. As Gary Wat- son said to the press \"I saw a true UFO along with the other witnesses and the two photos show what I saw.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"UFOs and the U.S. Government: Part II By William L. Moore The first part of William Moore's lengthy paper, delivered as the keynote speech at the MUFON Las Vegas symposium this summer, ap- peared in the November Journal. Moore is already at work on a se- quel, which will be published in his Focus newsletter, dealing with Lee Graham and other individuals. For more information, write Moore at 4219 W. Olive, Suite 247, Burbank, CA 91505. The anonymous arrival of the so- called MJ-12 documents in December of 1984 was another factor we had to contend with in this increasingly confusing web. The problem of their origin and authenticity was and re- mains a major issue, and on this point, our position of neutrality has constantly been misinterpreted. Therefore, for the record, it is impor- tant to point out here again that at no time have either I or any of my associates ever stated that these documents are authentic. Our posi- tion has consistently been that we do not know whether they are authen- tic, but that we, as investigators, re- main unaware of any convincing evidence which would suggest that they are not. That position remains essentially unchanged today, and I will have more to say about it when I get to the end of this paper. The bot- tom line, however, is that, authentic or not, the story of the documents is a major one which, as 1 have already assured you, will ultimately be told when I and my associates have com- pleted our investigation and are ready to tell it. That process has already taken considerably longer than I thought it would. I cannot predict when it will be complete, but I can say that progress has been made and it shouldn't be too much longer. For the many of you who have roundly criticised our methodology 8 throughout the MJ-12 controversy, it seems important to note here that what you were witnessing was the operation of a plan to put out just enough of this bizarre information to attract attention, and then carefully monitor who showed up with ques- tions to ask or information to offer. Once again, I was careful to state that I remained unconvinced of the authenticity of the information in- volved. In the case of the \"Falcon\" and \"Condor\" interviews broadcast last October on \"UFO Cover-Up? ... Live!,\" I am convinced that at least some, quite possibly a substantial por- tion, of that information falls under the category of disinformation. I am equally convinced that some of it is true. The important point here is that, regardless of whether it is disinforma- tion or truth, it DOES have to do with UFOs, and the sources who provid- ed it felt that doing so was important enough to risk going before national television in order to accomplish that purpose. Remember also that those sources knew that \"Falcon\" and \"Condor\" would be identified on the show as confidential government in- formants. The risk was all theirs, not ours; and still they went ahead, just as they are currently going ahead with the process of arranging a meeting to enable them to tell their stories before one or more members of Congress. I submit to you that such a process is extraordinary regardless of whether it involved truth or deception, and I think it's high time the UFO commun- ity stopped throwing rocks at it and began to consider the implications. One thing I can assure you of is that, rocks or not, our project will continue. You can either become involved, as others in the UFO community have done, or you can sit back and wait for the results. Whatever those results, good or bad, positive or negative, you will hear about them. Our \"trolling of the bait\" by means of progressive release of information, and ultimately by arranging for \"Falcon\" and \"Condor\" to appear on the \"UFO Cover-Up? ... Live!\" show, produced a variety of interesting results. Shortly after the show, the FBI showed up and began asking ques- tions about it. They even arranged for a private showing in the office of pro- ducer Michael Seligman. Agents on both east and west coasts interviewed a number of UFOlogists and other people, including Jaime Shandera, but, although I let it be known that I would be more than happy to talk to them, they avoided me. This I found to be particularly interesting in light of the FBI's admission to me, in response to a FOIA request, that they were maintaining nearly sixty pages of material on me that were all classified for reasons of national security. That was in July of 1988. I still have no idea what those pages contain. Another thing that occurred as we had hoped it would was that a rather small number of people came out of the woodwork claiming to have inside knowledge of one type or another about MJ-12 or similar government UFO projects. After weeding out the obvious cranks and several others whose claimed positions or associa- tions did not check out, or whose stories seemed to change every time they told them, we were left with a few leads which seemed promising. It is premature to offer you a report on any of these at this time except to say that we are still checking. Also, seemingly in direct relation- ship to our partial release of MJ-12 material two years ago, the flow of UFO-related disinformation has esca- lated from a point of near in- significance to what has become almost a flood tide. Indeed, many of you in the audience came here tonight looking for answers to ques- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"tions related directly to that problem. As I have taken great pains to point out, the current crop of disinforma- tion is really nothing new; it's just that a different crop of people are spreading it this time around. I expect that those responsible (not the rumor mongers themselves, but the ones who are feeding them) thought it would work just as well this time as it did last. The one thing I'm sure they didn't count on is that I would tell my story and thus become the fly in the ointment. Aztec Crash And speaking of flies in ointments, I think it is high time that I tell what I know about another situation that has found its way into the current crop of UFO disinformation. I offer this not to embarrass the person involved, but rather to shed light on an incident which, by the accounts of it which have appeared recently in a variety of UFO newsletters and at least one new book, is badly in need of clarification. It has to do with the rumored crash of a UFO near Aztec, New Mexico in the late 1940s. As many of you know, I researched this case and wrote an in-depth report about it which appears in the 1985 MUFON Symposium Proceedings under the title \"Crashed UFOs: Evidence in the Search for Proof.\" Although my 1985 paper presented a mountain of incontrovertible evidence to the effect that the case was a hoax perpetrated by two swindlers named Newton and GeBauer, the investigation that led to that conclusion was still far from com- plete three years earlier in 1982. It was in late '82, during one of the many friendly discussions I had with Richard Doty, that I happened to mention that I was researching the Aztec rumor, Rick indicated that he knew nothing about that matter, and wanted me to tell him everything I could about it. I did so, and, as I recall, he took some notes. Some months later, in early 1983, I became aware that Doty was in- volved with a team of several others, including one fellow from Denver that I knew of and at least one who was working out of Washington, D.C., in playing an elaborate disinformation game against a prominent UFO re- searcher who, at the time, had close connections with a major television film company interested in doing a UFO documentary. Although I was not in a position to know a whole lot about what was going on, I was able to put enough pieces of it together to conclude that the government seemed hell bent on severing the ties that existed between the researcher and the film company. My understan- ding was that because the researcher was known to have close ties to Ben- newitz and had exhibited a strong in- terest in his work, certain elements within the intelligence community were concerned that the story of his having intercepted low frequency electromagnetic emissions from the Coyote Canyon area of the Kirtland/Sandia complex would end up as part of the script of a feature film. Since this in turn might influence others (possibly even the Russians) to attempt similar experiments, some- one in a control position apparently felt it had to be stopped before it got out of hand. In any case, the prime objective of the counterintelligence people who swarmed around Ben- newitz between 1980 and 1984 seemed to be the maintenance of a high-level security net around the radio signals he was intercepting. I was unable to determine why this was a priority at the time and I still do not know today. What I do know, however, is that since they couldn't physically stop Paul from intercepting these signals, and since they hadn't been successful in enlisting his volun- tary silence, they fell back on a wall of disinformation as the best way to confuse the issue, and, ultimately, to call his credibility into question. When the film maker appeared on the scene and it looked as if Paul's story might become part of the script, the counterintelligence people simp- ly extended their disinformation ac- tivities accordingly. Part of this game involved a meeting between the UFO researcher in question, agent Richard Doty, and others at the AFOSI office at Kirtland AFB, wherein the re- searcher subsequently claimed to have been allowed to view certain purportedly sensitive documentation about the government's real involve- ment with UFOs. Included in this material was information about an alleged UFO crash/retrieval at Aztec. Richard Doty, who is bound by a security oath, cannot, and I am told will not discuss this matter except to say that he broke no laws and gave away no secrets that day. That, insofar as I am aware, is entirely correct. I, on the other hand, was never re- quired to sign a security oath and am therefore breaking no laws when I tell you that the information which changed hands that day was directly descended from the discussion Doty and I had had on that very topic on- ly a few months earlier! I can also tell you that it was a very effective decep- tion because the researcher involved continued to believe this information and actively continues to try to con- vince others of its truth even now — more than six years after the fact. Unfortunately, there was no UFO crash at Aztec. Nor was there much truth to any of the other material sup- plied to this particular researcher. The much touted alien harvest is really a dismal crop failure. To the best of my knowledge, it was all disinformation; and I was the one who had unwitting- ly supplied the fuel to those who were spreading the fire. Disinformation Disinformation is a strange and bizarre game. Those who play it are completely aware that an operation's success is dependent upon dropping information upon a target, or \"mark,\" in such a way that the person will ac- cept it as truth and will repeat, and even defend it to others as if it were true. Once this has been accom- plished, the work of the counterin- telligence specialists is complete. They can simply withdraw in the confidence that the dirty work of spreading their poisonous seeds will be done by others. Those who want proof of how well the process works need only look at the Bennewitz case, or the Aztec case. Every time one of you repeats an unverified or unsubstantiated bit of information without qualifying it as such, you are contributing to that pro- cess; and every time you do it, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"somebody in a need-to-know position sits back and has a horse laugh at your expense. One final comment on the Aztec hoax is that two other researchers who self-published a voluminous book (UFO Crash at Aztec) on the af- fair in. 1987 chose to completely omit any mention of my extensive and definitive research on the case, which had been published two years earlier, and which both researchers had copies of. It's a classic case of the book's principal author, Steinman, having decided what his conclusion would be before even beginning the process of \"investigation,\" and then totally ignoring everything which didn't fit. One of the problems the UFOlogy movement has with its im- age is that there is a significant number of people involved with it who support this sort of half-assed journalism. Q & A The next section of this presenta- tion will deal with questions and answers. The format, however, will be a bit different in that I will not take questions from the audience, but rather have elected to incorporate a number of questions and their answers directly into the body of this paper. Following the questions and answers I will present some conclusions. Question #1: Am I currently in- volved with providing information to any government agency about UFOs or about people involved with the UFO phenomenon? Answer: No. I have not had any such involvement since 1984. The ex- tent and scope of that involvement was essentially as I have already outlined. Question .#2: Am I presently in- volved in knowingly spreading any sort of disinformation about UFOs? Answer: No. The only conscious involvement I have ever had with a disinformation operation was that which I have already outlined in con- nection with the Bennewitz case. Question #3: Am 1 presently, or have I ever been on the payroll of any agency of the U.S. government? Answer: No. 10 Question #4: It is true that I show- ed UFO researcher Lee Graham an official identification card linking me with a government intelligence agency? Answer: Earlier in this paper I told you how I was recruited to supply in- formation on Mr. Bennewitz. The ex- act wording of my statement was \"Bennewitz ... and to a lesser extent, several other individuals.\" One of those \"other individuals\" was Lee Graham. This began in 1983, if memory serves. It is important to note here that, in addition to being a UFO researcher, Lee is also an avid military aircraft buff. As far as I am aware, the counterintelligence people were primarily interested in him because, at the time, Lee was making a lot of inquiries and collecting a great deal of information on the then very highly classified stealth aircraft program. Ap- parently there was some question as to why he was so interested in obtain- ing information on so sensitive a sub- ject — in other words, was he using it solely to satisfy a personal curiosi- ty, or was he passing it on to others who, perhaps, had foreign intelligence connections? There seemed to be on- ly minimal interest in his UFO activities. Lee is a completely above-board in- dividual who is a loyal U.S. citizen. In the process of keeping in touch with him, we became good friends. His knowledge of the fact that I had friends in the intelligence communi- ty gradually evolved into the firm belief on his part that I was much more than I really was. The I.D. card thing stems from nothing more than a practical joke on my part that has simply gotten way out of hand. Since the story surround- ing it is somewhat longer than time here will allow, I will commit to publishing it in our FOCUS newslet- ter so that it will be on record for anyone still interested. The fact is, I do not hold a government I.D. card. But think about it for just a moment ... If I did, does it make sense that I would pull it out of my wallet and show it to Lee Graham — or any other UFO researcher, for that matter? Question #5: Is it true that several hours of interviews with the source code-named \"Falcon\" were video taped, some in the presence of bona fide members of the news media; and is it true, as some had alleged, that those tapes were confiscated by the U.S. government? Answer: Yes, it is true that those tapes were made. No, it is not true that they were confiscated. They are still in our possession. Question #6: Is it true that I have characterized the cattle mutilation phenomenon as a hoax? Answer: No. Question #7: Do I know anything about the so-called \"Ellsworth AFB Humanoid\" case of 1977? Answer: Yes, some people have characterized this case as a hoax while others have attributed it to official disinformation. It is my position that this was a special counterintelligence training exercise in the creation and dissemination of disinformation. And, yes Richard Doty, who was stationed at Ellsworth at the time, was almost certainly a part of it; but not in a capacity where he would have been responsible for creating the docu- ments involved. Question #8: Do I know anything about the so-called \"Weitzel letter\"? Answer: Yes. The letter, which is loosely based upon an actual UFO case, was written anonymously to APRO in July, 1980 by Richard Do- ty and is directly related to the Ben- newitz affair. Essentially it was \"bait.\" AFOSI knew that Bennewitz had close ties with APRO at the time, and they were interested in recruiting so- meone within the APRO organization who would be in a position to provide them with feedback on Bennewitz's activities and communications. Since I was the APRO Board member in charge of Special Investigations in 1980, the Weitzel letter was passed to me for action shortly after it had been received. It was not long thereafter that I came to know Richard Doty and began providing him with information about the Bennewitz case. Question #9: What do I know about the so-called \"Aquarius Docu- ment\" which purports to be a fac- simile of an AFOSI teletype message dated 17 NOV. 1980? Answer: This is an actual example of some of the disinformation produc- ed in connection with the Ben- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"newitz case. The document is a retyped version of a real AFOSI message with a few spurious addi- tions. It was apparently created by AFOSI, or at least I always assumed it was, and it was handed to me in February, 1981 with the intention that I would pass it to Bennewitz. My understanding, although I never knew for sure, was that Bennewitz was ex- pected to wave it to the press and others as proof of what he was say- ing about an alien invasion, at which point the document would be de- nounced as a counterfeit and Ben- newitz would be further discredited. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately, depending upon one's point of view) it didn't turn out that way. (A highlighted version of this document, showing the real information and the added disinformation appears in the current issue of our newsletter FOCUS, which is available at our display table out in the lobby. I might also add that the entire text of this speech is also printed therein, for those of you who might want copies.) One additional bit of information about this document is the way in which it initially came to be known to the UFO community. In September of 1982, insofar as I was aware, there were only three copies of this docu- ment in existence. One of these I had passed to Bennewitz, a second was in safekeepiing, and a third was in my briefcase during a trip I had made to San Francisco. While there, I had a morning meeting with a man who turned out later to be an associate of UFOlogist Peter Gersten of New York. That same afternoon, my car was broken into and my briefcase was stolen. Four months later, a copy of •that same document complete with annotations I had penciled on it, turned up in the hands of none other than Gersten himself. To this day, I have never received a satisfactory ex- planation of how he obtained that document. Question #10: What about the AFOSI documents which speak of a 1980 UFO landing near a nuclear storage facility within the Kirtland AFB complex? Are these documents more disinformation, or are they authentic? Answer: To the best of my knowledge they are authentic. Question #11: What about other documents which I have either al- . luded to having or have published portions of without providing further details? Answers : Yes, there are a number of these and they came to us in several different ways. None of them, however, seem to have any direct connection to the Bennewitz case, nor, as far as I can tell, was Richard Doty directly involved in supplying them to us. Whether they are legitimate, or disinformation, or (more likely) a combination of both is still a matter of question. Once we have completed our study of these materials, we will make them available as well. Question #12: UFO-basher Phil Klass has been the topic of a number of rumors lately to the effect that he is an active government disinforma- tion agent. What do I think about that? Answer: Mr. Klass is a very astute individual who has long been a close follower of my activities. Indeed, I believe he was the only one out of the entire UFO community who man- aged to figure out what I and my associates were up to, and it horrified him! In my opinion, the very idea that someone might actually be capable of getting far enough into the UFO pro- blem to discover the truth constituted a personal threat to him that had to be dealt with. He has been obsessed with doing everything possible to try to either stop or discredit us ever since. As to his motives — I think it is best left to Mr. Klass to explain why he has acted as he has. Perhaps Phil bashes UFOs and the people who see them for the same reason that other people tear the wings off of flies. Or perhaps he gets well paid to do what he does. If there's nothing to UFOs, as he has consistently claimed, then I can't imagine why he gets so emo- tional about them — unless, of course, it's all part of the script. Phil's been bashing UFOs for over twenty years now. In that process, he's always been very quick to ascribe ulterior motives to the people who report them or investigate them. There are a lot of people in this au- dience who would be very interested in hearing what his ulterior motives MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989 are. Why does Mr. Klass bash UFOs? I, for one, would welcome some ra- tional explanation of just why a man would devote twenty years of his life to an essentially one-man crusade against something which he claims doesn't exist. If he's not spreading disinformation; if he's not on some government or private payroll, then just what is he up to and precisely what does he hope to accomplish by it? How about it, folks. How many of you would like to hear what makes Mr. Klass tick? I think he owes us all an explanation of what, in my opinion and I'sm sure in that of many others here, has been twenty long years of unprofessional attitude and reprehen- sible behavior. As a matter of fact, I think he owes a lot of people an apology, myself included. The pages of my newsletter FOCUS are open to you, Phil. Whenever, you're ready to accept this challenge, we'll be more than happy to print your reply. Now, having gotten that out of the way, this seems to be an appropriate place to tell you the story of mans' first contact with the Martians. During a world-wide telecast of the Martian ambassador's press conference, the following dialog transpired: Reporter: Tell me, Mr. Martian, what sort of social structure do you have on Mars? Martian: We are all devout com- munists. There are no cares or wor- ries in our society, and we are all ex- tremely happy! Reporter: Well, ah ... What is the one thing about living on Mars that makes you people the happiest? Martian: That's a very easy ques- tion. You see, unlike the people of Earth, we on Mars enjoy the distinct advantage of living in a completely Klass-less society. So, moving from the humorous back to the serious, here's ... Ques- tion #13: What do I think of Whitley Strieber and his claims of being a UFO abductee? Answer: At first, I was highly skep- tical and admittedly somewhat jealous of Whitley. As a result, I undertook to get to know the man in order to assess things for myself. In that pro- cess, he has earned my respect, my admiration and my friendship! Whitley 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"has come very close to the truth in a number of ways, and although still somewhat baffled by his experiences, has found a very acceptable way of accommodating them into his life. If one makes a conscious effort to remove Whitley's emotional reactions and then takes a good hard look at the remaining core of information, the result is an insightful look into what gives every appearance of being a real situation. In any event, I certainly wouldn't dismiss this man too lightly. We're going to hear from him before it's all over. Question #14: Jerome Clark reported in FATE magazine that I and Jamie Shandera made a trip to Washington, D.C. in anticipation of meeting a live alien, and were \"stood up\" in the process. Doesn't this im- ply that we were highly gullible in- dividuals and that the experience was probably just a practical joke on the part of the disinformation crowd? Answer: Not at all. If you stop to think about it, considering what you now know about our project and its goals, we had a story no matter what happened. We made the trip because we simply couldn't lose. But then, there's alot more to that experience than you know about, and this isn't the place where it's going to be told. Once again, let me caution you not to jump to conclusions until all the facts are in. Question #15: What are my plans for the future? Answer: I and my associates will continue our work and will continue to keep the public informed of our results as circumstances warrant. What you have heard today is only a small part of a very large body of information. Question #16: Assuming that they're interested, what can fellow UFOlogists do to support our con- tinuing efforts? Answer: First of all, what we are doing takes a lot of time and a lot of money. We have the time; it's the money which is not always available. The easiest thing you can do is to make a donation to the effort. Should you wish to offer time, or research ser- vices, or should you feel you have in- formation we might be interested in, please feel free to contact us at any 12 time. Two years ago in Washington, D.C., I stated that we were looking for help. The response was damn few of- fers and a lot of rocks thrown in our direction. I can say to you now in all candor that at last inventory we had plenty of rocks and we were still short of help. To those of you that still have rocks to throw, allow me to suggest that they might be better put to use by tossing them at the rumor mongers, the disinformers, the in- competents and the broken crockery presently running rampant in the UFO community. Those are the people who are really giving us a bad image. Which brings me, at last, to the final section of this lengthy paper. It seems to me that it's high time I made my position clear about a few things. A lot of people seem to be very inter- ested in knowing where Bill Moore stands on a number of issues, so here goes. Let me begin by stating that the positions presented here are entirely my own. All are based upon evidence obtained by me and my associates during the course of our project. Some of that evidence has already been made available, some is pro- vided for the first time in this paper, and some remains to be released at a later, more appropriate time. As to the existence and depth of the unreleased material... well, you'll just have to take my word for it for the time being. To the best of my knowledge, everything here is true. In- deed, although I confess to having practiced an occasional deception now and again over the years in order to protect the integrity of our project, our goal from the very beginning was to keep things as above board as possible. After all, ours has been a search for answers, not an effort to create more mysteries. Positions Position #1: A highly advanced ex- traterrestrial civilization is visiting planet Earth and is actively manipulating our awareness of their presence here. Position #2: At least two of the U.S. government's intelligence agencies are aware of this, and both are presently conducting highly classified, on-going, UFO-related projects. I can tell you without reservation that at least one of these efforts (and probably both) has access to electromagnetic, optical and infrared signature data which, if released to the public, would provide proof positive that some UFOs repre- sent someone else's highly advanced technology. Unfortunately, profes- sional ethics make it impossible for me to tell you any more at this time, so you'll just have to take my word that it is so. Those of you who find me competent and credible will take this as a major revelation — which is as it should be. Those who hold other opinions will continue to throw rocks while loudly demanding at the same time that I deliver proof positive into their hands on a silver platter so they can call it their own and claim credit for it. Patience, my friends. Patience. Position #3: U.S. government counterintelligence people have con- ducted an on-again, off-again cam- paign of deception and disinformation against the American public about the UFO phenomenon for more than 40 years. Those who have been respon- sible for such operations are highly placed individuals within at least two separate agencies, and there does seem to be a degree of cooperation between them. These operations in- volve a large number of people and are well-organized. They also include the use of phoney documents and the recruiting of informants who are able to provide information on the ac- tivities of people conducting UFO research or who have had UFO experiences. Several possible reasons are offered to explain this situation: • The disinformation is a security cover for a real UFO project which ex- ists at a very high level and is known to only an elite few. • It is a security process designed to divert attention away from real, but non-UFO related, high-tech research and development projects. • It is a manipulation by a group of highly placed and well-to-do in- dividuals (like the tri-lateralists) who espouse a one-world philosophy and who are using the UFO phenomena in a effort to bring about world unity in the face of an unknown threat from space. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"• It is a convenient way of training counterintelligence agents in the techniques of deception and disinformation. • It is a manipulation by UFO aliens themselves as part of a long-term plan to gradually make human society aware of their presence here. My position is that the truth is best described in terms of a combination of all of the above. In addition, the same group of peo- ple responsible for directing the spread of disinformation in the Ben- newitz affair have made contact with and are currently spreading essentially the same information through dif- ferent individuals today. Whether those people are witting or unwitting tools of this process, I do not know; but to the best of my information and belief at least some of them know ex- actly what they are doing. The last thing they expected, however, is that someone involved with the Bennewitz affair would pop up after so many years to burst their balloon. Position #4: There are three distinct aspects or levels to the UFO Phenomenon. These are: • Apparently ridiculous, often laughable claims by individuals which are often passed off as hoaxes, men- tal aberrations, or psychological derangements, but some of which would appear to merit further study. These include contactees, trance- channellers, religious apparitions, ac- counts of alien \"walk-ins,\" men in black, and a variety of New Age and metaphysical phenomena. • Typical counterintelligence deception and disinformation ac- tivities which center around the UFO phenomenon. • Truly paranormal events or ac- tivities which do not seem to lend themselves to prosaic explanations and which suggest the presence of a superior technology at work or the ex- istence of a higher consciousness. These include all of the best UFO cases as well as UFO-abduction events and at least some parapsycho- logical phenomena. All of these represent legitimate areas of study within the UFO phenomenon, and none should be rejected as too outrageous, ridiculous, implausible or impossible until it can be determined whether or not they are a part of the larger picture. Position #5: We have been able to confirm that there is in fact a group known as MJ-12 which operates at the White House/National Security Council level. To the best of my knowledge, this group still uses the MJ-12 designator. The level of securi- ty around this group is such that we have not yet succeeded in establishing whether or not its functions are UFO related or precisely how long it has been in existence. Along these same lines, none of our sources has indicated any knowledge whatsoever of terms such as \"Maji,\" \"Majesty,\" \"PI-40,\" \"Plato,\" \"Garnet,\" or a number of other terms currently circulating within the UFO grapevine. Position #6: There is, in fact, a Pro- ject Aquarius — possibly two of them. We have succeeded in obtaining con- siderable information about one such project in the 1971-73 time frame, and sketchy information about another (which may be a later exten- sion of the first one) in the 1976-85 time frame. This information includes contract and report numbers as well as the names of several individuals who worked on the project. More details will be forthcoming at a later date. Meanwhile, it ill behooves UFO researchers to deluge the government with Freedom of Information requests for information on sensitive, high-level projects. This simply alerts the powers-that-be that you are onto them, and thus makes it all more dif- ficult for those of us who are trying to obtain information through other channels. In the rush for \"me first\" in the UFO community, we are often our own worst enemies. Remember: \"Discretion is the better part of valor.\" Position #7: With respect to the controversial MJ-12 papers; these have now been examined by a number of questioned-documents ex- perts and other research on them is continuing as well, as you've just heard from my good friend Stanton. In the case of the Cutler-Twining memo found in the National Ar- chives, I can state with reasonable cer- tainty that it is an authentic document, and that best evidence indicates that someone planted it amidst the papers MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989 in Record Group 341 knowing that there was a strong chance we would find it there. With respect to the so-called Eisenhower Briefing Document, there is still no compelling reason to believe it is anything but authentic. On the other hand, its authenticity remains far from proved, so in the final analysis the scale remains balanced by the weight of arguments on both sides. If it's the real thing, it's going to take extraordinary evidence to con- vince even some of the more liberal skeptics. If it's a hoax, it's extraor- dinarily well done. In either case, there's a major story here and the controversy is far from over. As for the so-called Truman Ex- ecutive Order of Sept. 24, 1947, which is actually the final page of the portion of the Eisenhower document which we have, the analysts have come up with mixed results. Though not yet disproved, this document presents the weakest case of the three. We are not yet prepared to release a final report on this matter. Before leaving it, however, I would like to at least comment on what has emerged as the most controversial aspect of the MJ-12 document affair — that of the date format. There are a couple of points I would like to make: • If similarities between stylistic characteristics of the documents and my own writings are important, then are not dissimilarities equally impor- tant? There are some, you know — even in the way the dates are written. Why do those who go to such pains to point out similarities not go to equal p'ains to point out dissimilarities? Could it, I wonder, be prejudice? Or does the word \"incompetence\" bet- ter describe it? • We are by no means convinced that the date-format is as critical an issue as others would make it out to be. While the style is admittedly unusual, it is not without precedent. • To those of you who still harbor suspicions that I created the documents and am perpetrating a hoax, I say \"Thank you for the com- pliment!\" To those of you who think it more likely that I am the innocent victim of an elaborate hoax, I concede that this remains a possibility which has not yet been entirely ruled out. 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Position #8: The matter of alien ab- duction of humans is regarded as serious by those within the govern- ment who are aware of the extrater- restrial nature of UFOs. This is evidenced by the fact that the govern- ment has gone so far as to disinform its own counterintelligence people on the subject. Once again, you'll have to trust me on this until I'm able to provide you with more solid information. Position #9: The \"secret\" behind the government UFO cover-up is essentially an awareness of what UFOs are by a few people in high places who have connections with the National Security Council and the White House. Widespread publicity about the abduction phenomenon is an unwelcome complication in what is already a difficult situation. Within the \"in group\" there are strong dif- ferences of opinion as to whether in- formation should be released to the public and how fast. There also seems to be some consternation about ex- actly who is in control of the situation. Position #10: UFOIogy has been stumbling around for thirty years look- ing for answers. Unless something is done to reduce the petty bickering, the rumor mongering, the name call- ing, the ego massaging, the power politics and the personal vendettas which have been taking up our time, sapping our strength and disgracing our image lately, I expect mainstream UFOIogy will go right on stumbling for a long time to come. What is need- ed, I submit, is a Society of Profes- sional UFOlogists which adheres to established research procedures and techniques, which maintains a rigorous set of ethics and standards, and which limits its membership to an elite few whose competence has been appropriately demonstrated. No matter what happens, however, I am committed to completing the process I have begun. I am presently working with a network of more than a dozen individuals, some of whom hold very impressive credentials. We have been actively exploring the labyrinth of government UFO involve- ment, and we will continue to do so until we feel that task is complete or that we can go no furuther. Our group is euphemistically called \"the aviary\" 14 \"Every time one of you repeats an unverified or unsubstantiated piece of information, without qualifying it as such, you are contributing to the disinformation pro- cess. And every time you do that, somebody in a need-to-know posi- tion sits back and has a good horse laugh at your expense.\" and each individual involved has been assigned the name of a bird as an identifier. We will continue to provide the UFO community with data from time to time as circumstances warrant, and we will continue to proceed in the way which we feel best suits our purposes. A number of people have sug- gested to me recently that I should \"defend\" myself against various allegations and rumors which have been circulating around the UFO community lately. Well, folks — you've just heard the case for the defense. Now, reach down inside of yourselves again and wrench forth a judgement! I and my group of associates are going to find answers, no matter what it takes and no mat- ter how long it takes! We are out there in the field, we are digging, and we are going to continue to dig — either with the support of the UFO com- munity, or without it. Armchair researchers and \"hasty pudding\" pot- shot plaguerist UFOlogists whose only goal is to make themselves look im- portant at others' expense, take note! Those of you who think we're doing a good job and want to be part of that process, please know that we welcome any support you feel you can offer us. Those who feel it's all a con game can continue to throw all the rocks you want. We're going to go right on without you, just as we always have. This paper marks a radical change of position for me. In the past, I have always been very careful to qualify my statements about the possible extrater- restrial nature of UFOs so as to leave room for other explanations. I am now convinced beyond reasonable doubt that there is an extraterrestrial presence here on planet Earth. I am also convinced that a small number of individuals within our government know this but remains undecided as to what to do about it. Of this much I am certain, even though I am not yet free to release all of the evidence I have. The next stop is to uncover just how much of the rest of the UFO situation is for real and how much is horse manure. So either climb aboard and hang on, or get off the tracks.

The white, vertical, cone-shaped object appeared to be eight feet in diameter at the base and 20 feet in height. It was at an estimated altitude of 5000 feet and moving slowly south in the direction of the Carolines. About three hours later, at 4:30 p.m., what could have been the same object was observed coming into the atmosphere in a high speed vertical dive over Fayetteville, North Carolina. The ob- ject suddenly leveled off, and ap- peared to turn over as it did. It was described as appearing like a \"white blob,\" or like a \"drop of quicksilver.\" At 4:45 p.m., the object was spot- ted over Hamet, North Carolina, some 50 miles southwest of Fayet- teville. Phillip Gibbons, a Hamet pilot, took off in his aircraft in pursuit of the object. He said he got close enough to discern a \"large metal ball\" that ex- ceeded greatly the size of a weather balloon. He estimated the size of the ball to be 20 to 30 feet in diameter. The object was observed over Green- wood, South Carolina, at 5 p.m. by several witnesses. They described the object as looking like a \"fluorescent light bulb\" that remained stationary in the sky for 30 minutes, then suddenly \"shot off across the sky at a terrific rate of speed.\" *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - December 1954: On the second, a special secret conference was held at the Army Technical School, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The selected audience included important military personnel and civilian authorities. The subject to be discussed was UFOs. Colonel Adil de Oliveira was in charge. He made a careful evaluation of all information and evidence on UFOs collected around the world since 1947. He analyzed Project Blue Book and discussed seven outstanding cases from the Project's files. He discussed the best Brazilian sightings and con- cluded with the following statement: \"Evidence shows that the UFOs are real. No government could afford to ignore the reports about UFOs, and all investigations should be made to determine the identity of any UFO sighted over the country. The problem could be of military interest. The UFOs appear to be some kind of revolutionary aircraft. They are not conventional phenomenon or illu- sions. There are too many responsi- ble people involved to say that the whole thing was a hallucination. We don't know where they come from, and we don't know the purpose of their survey. I hope someday we could solve the riddle and know the answers.\" Closing the conference, Brigadier General Guedes Muniz said a few words: \"We, military technicians and aeronautic engineers, have not tried in the past to discuss the technological and scientific probability of these space vagabonds. And we are not try- ing to discuss it now, because we remember an old story, very good to be recalled here. Years ago the best aeronautical engineers in the world assembled together to study the hom- beetle flight. They analyzed the horn- beetle, its aerodynamic shape (entirely wrong), its flight surface, (tremen- dously deficient), its excessive heaviness and its incredible power. After a great deal of reasoning and scientific experimentation, they had made certain that the horn-beetle could not fly. But, the horn-beetle, knowing nothing of this, is still flying.\" News of the conference was releas- ed to the Brazilian people in the na- tional magazine Cruzeiro. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989 Just after sunset on the 13th, three round, cone-shaped craft passed across the skies of Campinas, Brazil. Moving noiselessly in a tight forma- tion, the unknowns shot out of the clouds at high speed and maneuvered over the city for a few minutes. The most incredible report came from a woman who was in her backyard washing some clothes when she saw the craft maneuvering in the sky at terrific speed. Suddenly one of the vehicles dived quickly in a new type of maneuver, and came very low over her roof, lighting up the surroundings for a few moments. This craft was dull-grey in color, round-shaped, resembling \"two plates turned upside down and put together;\" one of the plates was fixed, but the other was spinning like a top, emitting a strong fluorescent light which illuminated the ground around her for a few seconds like daylight. Then, in an unexpected maneuver, it abruptly rushed up into the night to join the others. At that moment a liquid substance fell from the vehicle toward the ground like a \"silver rain.\" Part of this material fell in her backyard on the concrete area near the washing tank. Before a number of witnesses the material was collected by Professor Benedite G. Nascimen- to and sent to Young Laboratories for analysis by their chief chemist, Dr. Viavalde Maffei. The next day, Dr. Maffei issued the following statement: \"The 'substance' analyzed had 88.91V2 percent tin, chemically pure tin. The rest was oxygen, derived from the high degree of oxidation of the molten metal in the atmosphere. I can affirm categorically that this is the purest tin ever found on Earth; in no place on our planet can a concen- tration as high as this — with so perfect a purity — be obtained. I would like to stress, on the other side, that tin manufactured for industrial use has only 75 percent of it (pure) — the rest being constituted of other elements like iron, antimonium, lead, arsenium, etc. \"Even the purest tin manufactured by special procedures, with a percen- tage of 99.99 percent (purity), presents infinitesimal quantities of these elements — which can be de- tected by specrroscopic analysis. In 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"the material analyzed, however, the metal is absolutely pure, chemically pure, with a percentage of 100 per- cent. The oxygen can be obviously discarded. It was not in the original material. To conclude, I consider the material in question as completely unknown to this Earth ... that is, tin of the most absolute purity, in con- centration never found until today.\" The incident made headlines all over Brazil. The report and statement were published and discussed by Rio's newspapers on December 22nd, 23rd and 24th. *** TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO - December 1964: Horace Burns was driving near Fisherville, Virginia, about 5 p.m. on the 21st when he spotted a large metallic object com- ing out of the sky north of the highway. As it crossed Route 250 about 200 feet ahead of him, his car's engine stopped \"just as if I'd run out of gas.\" The craft landed in a field about 100 yards away. He got out of his car to look at the vehicle which resembled an upside-down ice cream cone. \"It was 125 feet in diameter, at least, and 80 to 90 feet high,\" said Burns. He was not sure of what material it was made of although it looked like spun aluminum. Around the perimeter of the base there was a band of bluish glow about a foot wide. It had no visible windows or doors. The craft rested in the meadow about 90 seconds, Burns said, then it suddenly rose perpendicularly for several hundred feet and took off at a very fast speed. It made only a soft \"whooshing sound.\" He was then able to restart his car. Ernest Gehman, pro- fessor of Eastern Mennonite College at Harrisonburg visited the landing site on the 30th to take a radiation reading with a Geiger counter. \"It knocked the thing (needle) off the dial,\" Gehman said, indicating a high concentration of radiation. He said his meter registered over 60,000 counts per minute. A team of Air Force in- vestigators reported a significant radia- tion reading on the left side of Burns' car. *** 16 FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - December 1974: One night early in the month, William \"Bill\" Bosak was driving on County Road 'W about six miles east of Frederick, Wisconsin, when the headlights of his car reflected off something in the west- bond lane. Sitting in the roadway, as Bosak tells it, was a strange contrap- tion with an even stranger being in- side. The 69-year-old dairy farmer was convinced he happened upon a ship from outer space — occupied by an extra-terrestrial being. \"It had a curved front of glass, and inside I could see a figure with its arms rais- ed above its head,\" Bosak said. \"The figure had a square face with hair sticking straight out from the sides of its head. Its ears were long and nar- row and stuck straight out. Its arms were brown and furry, and there was fur or hair on the top part of its body. \"I couldn't tell if the figure was wear- ing a tight fur suit or had fur itself. I could only see the top half of the body, but the figure appeared to be a little taller than a tall man. The eyes were very large and protruding. And it seemed to me to be afraid. But it wasn't nearly half as scared as I was. When I passed the thing the inside of the car got dark, like a shadow was being cast, and I could hear a kind of soft whooshing sound, like a branch brushing against the side of the car,\" Bosak said. After reflecting on the ex- perience for a few weeks, Bosak said he felt he did the wrong thing by speeding away from the craft. \"I should have stopped and tried to show it I was friendly,\" Bosak said. \"I wish I could meet up with it again.\" Mr. and Mrs. Marose were driving near Taber, Alberta, Canada about 1:00 a.m. on the first when they no- ticed some lights off to the left ahead of them. \"Just as we completed the turn, this object showed up in our headlights,\" Mr. Marose said. \"It was spherical in shape, and about 10 feet in diameter, and was surrounded on the outer surface by a ring of brightly colored lights. As soon as our lights hit it, it moved right toward us at a high rate of speed, and then as it neared the truck it zoomed overhead, and started to follow us. It would come up beside us, and when I'd speed up in the truck, it would speed up right with us, and then sail off ahead and circle back. At one point it moved toward the power line along the road, and I remarked to my wife that it might strike the wires, but it dip- ped right underneath the lines a cou- ple of times and moved along with us. It seemed to be chasing us and acted as though it were playing tag. \"It followed us this way for about two and a half miles, but when we neared the farm it moved away from us, and hovered in the sky about half a mile from the farm as I put the truck away. Boy, I'll tell you we were really scared,\" Mr. Marose said. Darrel Marose also saw the craft. He watch- ed it through a pair of binoculars from the house as it played around the truck but he didn't know at the time it was his brother's vehicle. Shortly after the truck was put away, the sphere sailed away at high speed and disappeared. \"My wife was one of the non-believers,\" Mr. Marose said, \"but I'll tell you, she sure believes in them now.\" Early in the evening of the 21st, 15-year-old Rodney Walta, his girl friend and a younger brother were driving near Marissa, Illinois, when they saw an object whiz by them, then traveling parallel to the road about a quarter mile away. They described the craft as being \"dome- shaped\" and having \"white and blue antenna-like structures on it.\" Later that night the trio experienced another encounter. This time they stopped the car to watch it. Walta said the object, which was tubular in shape this time, hovered over the area as if it were searching for something. He said a beam-like ray then shot out from underneath the craft, \"like mer- cury falls,\" sucking up particles from the ground. \"Then, like it suddenly noticed us there watching it, it stopped what it was doing and started to move toward us,\" Kim Lloyd added. \"It was then that we decided to get out of there.\" Continued on page 21 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Dear Editor: I have to admit I am suffering from an acute mixture of nausea and dyspep- sia on reading the article by John L Spencer in the September issue, titled •A New Model of Investigation,' re- garding the Barney Hill case. Mr. Spencer is not only a victim of outrageous rationalization, he writes like a rusty version of a tin god sitting on the roof of the Tower of London, dispensing an alleged wisdom sorely in need of patching up in a repair shop, after his huffing and puffing through more erroneous assumptions than those that have been gathered in his- tory. His recounting of the Hill abduction case is riddled with errors, on which he builds his tenuous theories. If he had carried out the same three years of intensive research that I went through in writing The Intempted Journey I might have been willing to listen to his rather slippery, elusive and shaggy arguments. Did he spend two full months living with Barney and Betty Hill in their home, night and day, probing their story from every possible angle? Did he spend two full weeks driving with Barney and Betty Hill over the ex- act same route they followed to Can- ada, and return, probing every site in- volved in the story? Did he request Barney and Betty to reenact their ac- tions at over seven key sites near Canon Mountain, along Route 3, down through dirt ruts where they recall the abduction took place? Did he spend every evening for six weeks interviewing Dr. Benjamin Si- mon in his home, listening to over 40 hours of taped interviews, with the Hills under hypnosis, and with questions to the doctor on a stop and go basis? Did he review the tapes personally with both Barney and Betty Hill, also on a stop and go basis for over a peri- od of several weeks? Did he make a complete review trip with both Hills, from the Canadian bor- der through Colebrook, Lancaster, Canon Mountain, and Concord, New Hampshire, over a twelve hour trip through the White Mountains of New Hampshire? Did he spend two full days checking the supervisors, neighbors, friends and Church members of Bar- ney and Betty Hill? Did he arrange and carry out two hypnosis sessions with the Hills and Dr. Simon, with permission for me to ask any questions I wanted of the Hills under deep hypnosis? Was he on hand to observe the first session in which the Hills volunteered to enter a trance together, and with Dr. J. Allen Hynek and I permitted to freely ask questions in a three-hour trance session? Did he attend the trance session in which I and the senior editors of two major magazines were permitted to ask questions to verify every word in my articles for the Reader's Digest, Look, and The Saturday Review, three of the highest ranking national magazines in the country? These trance sessions have never been published. I am the only one in possession of the tapes, each over two hours long. No one could posstbJy assess the Hill story without the knowledge of what is on these tapes, as Mr. Spenc- er has attempted to do. Since I know that Mr. Spencer has not come anywhere near the depth of this research, and has attempted to make judgment with great segments of this research missing, all his speci- ous theories should be dismissed. Knowing the whole story, up front and backstage, the only rational con- clusion to come to is that which Dr. Simon clearly and unambiguously told me at the conclusion of the trance sessions that Mr. Spencer obviously knows nothing about: As Dr. Simon clearly summed up the story: The Hills are not lying. The Hills were not hallucinating. The Hills were not psychotic. As far as the 'Dream Theory* was concerned, Dr. Simon never reached that conclusion, as Mr. Spencer sug- gests. Mr. Spencer should go back to his drawing board, and try to learn the massive amount of missing evidence which he has ignored I John G.

If this force existed, how far could I pro- ject it - locally, nationally, around the planet? If this force could be identified, my experience would be a much greater one than a UFO capture.

I refused. I know I do not have any kind of unidentified tremendous \"force. 1 Barney did not know my dreams. He was not at home when I dreamed these as he worked the midnight shift in Boston. Although I made records of my dreams, I hid these and he never read them. All Barney knew was that I had a series of dreams in which the possibility existed that we did not es- cape capture. In my dreams I had no knowledge of his experiences when he was not with me. To carry this a step further, why do all those people who live around this planet, who have never heard of me, or my dreams, or my experience, have a similar experience? The gods of this world do not need to move over to make room for me, because I had no influence in this. However, it has always been a puzzle to me why researchers avoid one of the most important segments of my book. Dr. Simon taught hypnosis at medical schools in the Boston area, and was probably one of the top men in this field in the world. On pages 82- 85 of the paperback copy of Inter- rupted Journey, he explains hypnosis, the three levels of trance, and the testing to determine the level of trance. Is it avoided because they know that any abduction revealed in the light stage of trance is invalid? This is the stage of suggestibility. Betty Hill Portsmouth, NH Spencer Replies The text of my London talk on \"Wit- ness Driven Investigations\" seems to have started something of a debate over on your side of the pond. Frankly, I don't understand some of the re- sponses; the authors seem to have used my article as the launching point for something they wanted to say, even though it bore no relation to me or my comments. (Editor's note: Spencer had been shown a number of responses, other than those of Ful- ler and Hill alone.) Let me just be clear about what I did say in case that gets lost in the fog: I said that the Betty and Barney Hill case was well investigated (it was a \"controlled\" experiment since the hypnotic recall mirrored her dreams so exactly). The witnesses were credible, telling the truth as they understood it, and were not in any way \"unbalanced.\" Mr. Fuller sums up his letter with this conclusion, with which I entirely agree and say so in the article. (By the way, I have for years held Mr. Fuller's book up as a model of good reporting, so you can well appreciate how disappointed I was with his reac- tion.) I suggested that the hypnotic recall may have drawn out the dream mate- rial rather than recall of actual events. The medical people I work with in the UK believe this to be highly likely, and even Dr. Simon seems to consider this a likely possibiity, given the quotation I used in the article which comes from Mr. Fuller's book. Given the above, subsequent inves- tigators may be spreading Betty's dream material around the world as they investigate abductions because they are carry ing this well documented role model in their heads during their investigations. If so, then real material may be being lost or distorted be- cause of the suggestive nature of hypnotic regression. And that was all the article saysl I am disappointed that such a suggestion should be regarded as outrageous. For my interpretations of the possibii- ties the Hill case offers I accept re- sponsibility, but I must stress that I don't believe I have used any fact about the case that is not indicated or supported in Mr. Fuller's book. I notice that neither Mr. Fuller nor Betty Hill have actually spelt out which facts they argue with. With regard to Betty Hill, I must point out (since she has not) that I took the trouble to confirm my facts with her personally by telephone in December 1988. (All of this is indicated in the nar- rative.) At that time I told her that I would be offering a theory that her ab- duction (as it is presently understood) might have been only a dream - and I'm not the first to suggest that - and she only asked me to point out that she did not agree with that (which I do in the article), though she herself sug- gested that more recent cases may have been part psychological in origin (which I also report in the article). I think I've been fair to Mrs. Hill; I should have been happier had she reported my efforts in her letter. And why Mrs. Hill believes that her dream being the source of her story should \"set her up against the gods,\" as she suggests I am trying to do, is a most bizarre mystery to me; if any- thing, surely I am suggesting a mun- dane explanation for events. (Is that in fact what annoys her?) I suspect that Mr. Fuller's \"nausea and dyspepsia,\" and his belief that I am \"like a rusty version of a tin god...dispensing an alleged wisdom,\" is his way of accusing me of 'armchair Ufology.\" This seems born out by the fact that after having told me my \"re- 18 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"counting of the Hill abduction case is riddled with errors,' he goes on to ex- plain his own involvement in the case rather than tell me what my errors were. Let me put that suggestion to rest. I did not pick up The Jnterwpted Journey and decide to invent a new case in my armchair. The whole ques- tion raised by my article starts from my own abduction work with different teams in several countries of Europe/Scandanavia (obviously most- ly the United Kingdom). Given very similar basic data to current, famous American cases, quite different stories emerge (often when hypnosis is not used and other techniques are). As part of my trying to understand that, I tried to find out why a very common theme was spreading around the world in parallel to alternative themes, depending on the investigators. It is impossible to go into all this work now, but the point is that my article arises from a great deal of work in the field, not the armchair. Incidentally, Mr. Fuller seems to be castigating me for not being in on the Hill investigation, which is hardly my fault, as I was only seven years old at the time! I can assure him, however, that I have done no less work than he on my cases, including, as he did, liv- ing with several of the witnesses for periods of time. If your respondents believe that this is me being clever and criticizing other researchers while saying, \"but I got it right,' I can assure them it is not. When I talk of 'we' getting it wrong in the article, I mean just that; much of my own earlier work made all of what I now regard as these mistakes. I am only asking other researchers to share the same self-doubts that arose when (started comparing results with other teams across the world. When I raise- questions on Budd Hopkins's work I mean them to be only that, questions, not criticisms; and when I raised similar questions on my own early work, I was found wanting. I would also like to be clear about what I did not say: I did not say abductions were psychological in origin (I stated my be- lief in a possible 'nuts and bolts' re- ality). I believe only that there are psychological elements to these events. One case I'm working on is an abduction with an independent wit- ness and the involvement of no less than fifty local officials involved in a 'stake-out-cum-skywatch.' I'm ready and happy to accept that there are things going on up there; I just doubt we understand what it is, or what we're going to do if we carry on as we are. That is why I don't seek to dismiss physical evidence; I just want to be sure we understand it properly. I was also very disappointed to hear from Walt Andrus that a MUFON State Director, no less, used my article as 'proof that I was a debunker. My ded- ication is clear: for over a decade I've been a director of BUFORA (Britain's equivalent to MUFON); I currently hold the vice-Chairman's job, which is equivalent to Walt's second-in- command. I am also an officer of the International Committee for UFO re- search, a position I proudly share with Walt. Seeking the truth and question- ing current theory is not debunking. That suggestion says more about its author than it does me. However, let me suggest something sure to generate a whole new mailbag of abuse. I'll suggest that none of the above, or the stated words of those who wrote in, is really what is important here. All this just masks the true emo- tions. I suggest that the reason that I have been so vehemently criticized is because I seem to have dared to challenge the Extra-Terrestrial Hy- pothesis, which is fast becoming a fundamentalist religion in the United States. As such, my suggestion is being viewed not as scientific curiou- sity, but as heresy. UFOs are rapidly joining Sex, Religion and Politics as avoidable subjects (which is a matter for some regret). And this suggestion does not arise from my armchair, ei- ther; it is a possible conclusion from my work in trying to understand why America seems to have treated UFOs on a quite different social level than any other country I know of, certainly in Europe. (Walt and I witnessed some of this when we were together at the Brussels Conference in 1988). But since that is exactly what Walt wants me to talk about at Pensacola in July 1990, I'll leave all that for then. John Spencer Harpenden, UK Coming Soon... WHAT JUNG BELIEVED ABOUT UFOs NEW BRUNSWICK CLOSE ENCOUNTER HOAXHOLES UFO DISINFORMATION AND MUCH, MUCH MORE... MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"\"Mixed Message\" By John S. Carpenter, ACSW Carpenter is a Missouri State Section Director and Research Specialist for MUFON, working as a psychiatric social worker and hypnotherapist in abduction research in Springfield, Missouri. It would certainly be important, if we were to seriously consider new frameworks of thinking and investiga- tion, that we dispose of the old nasty ones as well. Unfortunately, John Spencer's \"Part I: A New Model of In- vestigation\" contained both. This ar- ticle is a puzzling mixture of careful, thorough, painstaking analysis and rash, sweeping generalizations which seem to reveal an underlying bias and hope that this abduction pheno- menon can be disposed of neatly. There is contradiction in his arguing \"that there is no reality behind these events\" and his later assumption \"that the Hill's encounter was in fact a non- reality.\" However, I sincerely applaud his ef- forts to perform the necessary and fedious examination of how reading materials, dreams and seemingly in- nocent discussions of UFO informa- tion could have been suggestible or influential in the Hill's case. His discus- sion of inconsistencies is vital. His careful outlining of events demon- strates the critical importance of tim- ing and the sequence of events with consideration to the potential con- tamination of recall. Yet, I cringed at his occasional and abrupt departures from careful analysis and his arrival at broad explanations for the entire com- plex phenomenon of abductions, based on only a few cases. He states that all others \"are versions and cor- ruptions of the Hill's case; they are copies of the original.\" Further exten- sive study of present data would dispel this notion quickly. These suggestions shall certainly come as a shock to those alleged ab- ductees who tell the \"same story\" but have never heard of Betty and Barney Hill, nor read any UFO material. It 20 is certainly similarly difficult to under- stand how young children — not aware of the Hill case — tell a strik- ingly similar account while trembling with fear and drawing those same lit- tle large-eyed creatures without any knowledge of UFO material before- hand due to their young ages. Then we also have other similarities not pre- sent in the Hill's case which have been found repeatedly in the growing mass of research data. Mr. Spencer was wise in referring to some of these issues which give his generalizations some real difficulty. But then, he again quickly departs from his careful analysis into an irrational assumption (that they are always sharing Betty's dream!), suggesting that he has a real need to wrap up this mystery regardless of the data. Is not this the kind of rash concluding which we should leave behind us in order to evolve toward a healthier form of in-, vestigative methodology? If \"missing time\" is a misperception, then how could the documented absences of Travis Walton and many others be explained? A classic characteristic of skepticism is to sidestep and avoid mentioning aspects of a case which cannot be ex- plained. Perhaps Mr. Spencer has considered Betty's famous star-chart or her description of the needle- through-the-navel \"pregnancy test,\" two years before its invention. If so, why not let us understand how these fit into his theoretical explanation? Although it is suggested that Barney was \"very impressionable,\" it is highly unlikely from a psychiatric perspective that the telling of Betty's dreams would traumatize him so in- tensely! Just as unlikely is the ridiculous notion that the recalling of Betty's dream material under hyp- nosis would bring him such relief from his symptoms. The telling of fantasy does not relieve traumatic symptoms. Certainly, if her dreams were so dis- turbing to him, then further dwelling upon them would be of no sensible value or therapeutic relief. In addition, if Barney was so \"impressionable,\" then why couldn't Dr. Simon get Barney to alter his recollections through repeated questioning and suggestions? Although nobody can claim to understand exactly how the mind's defenses of repression and amnesia operate in protecting us from what our minds could remember, Mr. Spencer seems to neglect the fact that traumas can be well-hidden from our conscious minds for an indefinite number of years. Thus, the more re- cent disclosures of alleged abductions do not mean anything more neces- sarily than the possibility that recent public exposure to this material has triggered more acceptance and will- ingness to explore these confusing and traumatic bits of memories which were previously believed to be mistaken feelings and \"crazy thoughts\" which were too bizarre to tell. Mr. Spencer suggests that Budd Hopkins is the one just now reveal- ing these stories. Budd has become a trusted, credible public figure to whom thousands of people are now writing their private fears and sensitive questions in seeking some form of long overdue relief. These people are not unlike those who have suffered from incest, sexual abuse, and other very private and highly sensitive material. For years the extent and in- cidence of incest was doubted and denied. With such societal disbelief families clung to their secrets and suf- fered silently. Those who tried to talk were labeled \"crazy.\" Finally more data and education of this problem created more belief in its incredible widespread occurrence and need for treatment. Would you suggest that social workers had elicited or en- couraged these tales — probably copies from some original and earlier published account? If indeed the ab- duction phenomenon is as real as it seems, is not the preceding scenario MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"BACK, Continued Shortly after arriving at the Walta house, the climax of their evening was about to begin. \"I heard something whirring or humming above our house and the dogs weren't barking,\" Walta said. \"Then there was this clat- tering sound on the roof, like some- one walking around up there. This was too much! Then I heard some kind of grunting.\" Miss Lloyd and Walta said they ran to a closet and grabbed shotguns. \"We only heard the noise on the roof for a couple of minutes,\" Walta added. \"But it sure seemed longer. Then this loud hum- ming started again, like a tuning fork, and we got a shock — a real electrical-like shock.\" Walta said the shock was strong enough to knock him down and jolted one of his sisters out of bed. He said the dogs outside were unusually quiet because they had been stunned, too. \"I got to the window to look out and there it was,\" he said. \"A craft which was about 25 to 30 feet across. It was a dome- shaped vehicle and was hovering over our yard. Then it took off like a bolt of lightning. It sounded like a train.\" Mrs. Walta, who slept through the whole episode, said she believed her son. She said she has never seen him so emotionally upset in his life — he didn't eat or sleep for four days after the incident. Rodney said he used to laugh at people who reported UFOs, but added \"I won't laugh about these things any more.\" MIXED, Continued a reasonable and believable explana- tion for how this phenomenon is evolving? Strong public disbelief mix- ed with terrifying fears that \"it might be real\" is enough for anyone to re- main silent for years — until one saw an opportunity to explore it safely... I do not wish my praise for Mr. Spencer's careful examinations to be lost in this critique. I certainly agree with much of his tedious analysis in regard to possible suggestion, con- Continued next page MUPON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989 The Night Sky By Walter N. Webb December 1989 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus attains greatest brilliancy (magnitude -4.7) on December 14. Around this time the planet appears as a crescent shape in small telescopes. The nearby world can be viewed low in the SW after sunset. It sets about 7 PM in midmonth. Jupiter, in Gemini, approaches a point oppostie the Sun on the 27th and shines brightly at magnitude -2.7. The giant of our solar system then rises in the NE about sunset and remains visible in the southern sky all night. Saturn (magnitude 0.5), in Sagittarius, becomes increasingly difficult to glimpse low in the WSW after sunset. The planet sets about l l /2 hours after the Sun in mid-December but only half an hour after at month's end. Mercury may be seen 2° below Saturn on the 16th; the former will shine one magnitude (2 l /2 times) brighter than the latter. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (magnitude 1.6), moves from Libra into Scorpius and Ophiuchus during the month. The dim red planet rises about 5 AM in mid-December and stands very low in the SE at sunrise. Jupiter dominates the sky all night, advancing to the west by dawn and setting in the NW at sunrise. Meteor Shower: Unlike last year's moonless sky, the Geminid meteors this December will have a gibbous Moon around all night to wash out much of the shower during its peak on the morning of the 14th. Nevertheless, observers may be able to glimpse occasional bright white streaks rushing away from the constellation Gemini. The shower occurs in lesser numbers from about the 7th to the 15th. Moon Phases: First quarter — December 5 Full moon — December 12 Last quarter — December 19 New moon — December 27 The Stars: By now at 9 PM, the summer stars have almost disappeared in the west; the autumn stars are past the celestial meridian; and the winter groups with their brilliant luminaries dominate the SE sky. Look for the Great Hunter Orion, his shoulders marked by reddish Betelgeuse and bluish- white Bellatrix, his belt by three stars in a row, and his legs by Saiph and Rigel. To the left of Orion is Gemini with the heads of the twins, Pollux and Castor, and a brilliant interloper the planet Jupiter. Below the hunter rises the brightest star Sirius. And to Orion's right charges the Bull Taurus, his face outlined by the Hyades cluster and orange Aldebaran. The famous little dipper-shaped cluster in the bull's shoulder, the Pleiades, is occulted by the nearly full moon on the morning of the llth. 21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"tamination of data from reading materials, psychosomatics, and other discrepancies. This kind of cautious research is essential! One must be skeptical and avoid assumption. One must examine inconsistencies in the data. But one must always keep an open mind and not be eager to generalize conclusions or come to broad assumptions without examin- ing countless more pieces of data — many of which will significantly con- tradict Mr. Spencer's bold and unfor- tunate statements. I am willing to ad- mit that his careful survey of certain elements of the Hill's case is a good demonstration of how important data can be overlooked — a good lesson for us all! Let us remember those ideas for the future. Let us also remember — as clearly yet sadly demonstrated in his article — that eagerness to \"solve the mystery\" and explain the entire phenomenon from a few cases can result in these kinds of unfounded generalizations. The only consolation for alleged abductees is that he does not believe that they are lying or insincere. Instead he proposes a more irrational and in- credible notion that they are all dreaming Betty's dream and sub- consciously creating variations on her theme, whether they have ever heard of Betty Hill or not! This kind of insensitive and unlikely idea only serves to discredit the com- mendable efforts and analysis that he presented so well in the very same ar- ticle. Let us be certain that any truly new model of investigation is indeed free of old habits and haunting errors. Our proposals and research must be soundly based in all the data, and we must curb our enthusiasm to prematurely solve it all at once. 1 look forward to reading Part II! JANUARY SKY, Continued to Andromeda and find another smudge of light, the Andromeda Galaxy, actually another star system similar to our own Milky Way but beyond our system at a distance of two million light years. 22 The Night Sky By Walter N. Webb January 1990 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): This is a transition month for Venus. Early in the month our brilliant neighbor can still be seen low in the SW, gleaming at magnitude -4.6 on the 1st and setting about 6:30 PM. A week and a half later it is dimin- ished only slightly to -4.2 but sets earlier about 5:30. Its waning crescent phase is easily seen in small telescopes and may even be detected in binoculars. The nearby planet moves into the morning sky January 18. Jupiter (magnitude -2.7), having passed opposition last month in Gemini, is in the east at dusk and dominates the southern winter sky all night. The yellowish giant planet even outshines Sirius, the brightest star, by three times. The gibbous Moon lies nearby on the 9th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus becomes visible again late in the month in the ESE at dawn. Mars (magnitude 1.5), in Ophiuchus, rises shortly before 5 AM in mid- January and is visible in the SE not far from the brighter red star An- tares. As the month progresses, the faint ruddy planet shifts away from the star, moving from the upper left of Antares to the lower left. The lunar crescent is nearby on the 23rd. Jupiter advances across the southern sky during the morning hours, finally setting in the WNW at dawn. Saturn (magnitude 0.5), in Sagittarius, becomes visible again in the last few days of the month low in the SE at dawn. The ringed world joins Venus, Mars, and Mercury in that part of the sky. Moon Phases: First quarter — January 4 Full moon — January 10 Last quarter — January 18 New moon — January 26 € O The Stars: During midevening hours the skies of winter are enhanced by the bright stars of the great warrior Orion and, encircling him, the stars of the Winter Circle — Sirius in Canis Major (the Big Dog), Procyon in Canis Minor (the Little Dog), Pollux and Castor in Gemini (the Twins), Capella in Auriga (the Chariot-driver), Aldebaran in Taurus (the Bull), and Rigel in Orion (the Hunter). In a darkened rural sky, the Milky Way, our star city home in the universe, flows like a celestial river directly overhead from NW to SE. This month, at 9 PM, the observer with binoculars is rewarded with a number of special objects in the heavens. Moving from east to west, first focus on a faint smudge between the Sickle of Leo and Gemini — the wedge-shaped star cluster called the Beehive. Next, see if you can detect one or more of Jupiter's four major moons (the view is better, of course, in a small telescope). Dropping down to Orion, note that the \"fuzzy star\" in the hunter's sword turns out to be the famous Orion Nebula, a glow- ing gas and dust cloud where new stars form. In Taurus, examine the beautiful star field of the bull's face, the V-shaped Hyades cluster. And nearby don't forget the popular little cluster, the Pleiades.

Varnicle WA3QLW NET SCHEDULE 80 meters 40 meters 10 meters 3.960 MHz 7.237 MHz 28.046 MHz (new frequency) It is apparent that interest in MUFON and UFO activity is growing again. Each of the nets now has at least 15 stations checked in. The 40 Meter net is still run as an informa- tion net, only short pieces of news are given. The 80 Meter and 10 Meter nets are discussion nets. The 80 Meter net is the most active in discussions as propagation holds for hours at that frequency. The 10 Meter net should be of interest to all Novice and Techni- cian amateurs as that frequency is within their sub-band. I appointed Larry Tillman and Hal Starr as NCS (Net Control) stations for the 10 Meter net. As of this time no one station wishes to assume NCS for 80 Meters, although NW8I and MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 260 December 1989 Saturday, 9 p.m. Eastern Saturday, 8 a.m. Eastern Thursday, 8 p.m. Eastern N9CBL are the prime movers on that frequency. David Dobbs and myself are running NCS for 40 Meters. All of the NCS stations employ other sta- tions to assist during times of poor propagation. Several stations (N1JS, WA3QLW, WD8ARZ, NW1F, NJ1A and many more) are experimenting with packet as a form of traffic relay of UFO in- formation. If this proves to be a reliable form of communication for us and I have no doubt that it will; then there will be a packet network to add to MUFON's communications system. All \"Hams\" are invited to check into one of these nets and share the most current UFO news and events. 23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Director's Message By Walt Andrus The November 1989 issue of the Journal No. 259 at 32 pages equalled the special Gulf Breeze issue of April 1989, however it set a new record by being mailed to 2240 members and subscribers. Even at 32 pages the editor had to hold back \"letters to the editor\" and a portion of the Director's Message relating to new officers for the month. We hope that our readers were pleased with the expanded edition. The entire staff of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL want to take this op- portunity to express our best wishes for the holiday season to all of our members/subscribers that have been responsible for the continuing growth of the world's leading UFO magazine — Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. New Officers Henry H. McKay, Regional Di- rector for Canada, has appointed Marc Leduc, M.A. of Lac Beauport to be the new Provincial Director for Quebec. Mr. Leduc is employed by the provincial government as a specialist in measurement and evalua- tion in education. Ethan A. Rich, residing in Englewood and former Assistant State Director, has been pro- moted to Colorada State Director replacing Myron W. Carlson who will continue in the capacity of State Sec- tion Director for Weld County. Ethan is a amateur radio operator WBOAPG. Kenneth McLean, former State Director for Wyoming, recently moved to Highwood, Mont, where he has volunteered to become the Mon- tana State Director, filling an impor- tant vacancy. June O. Parnell, Ph.D., a Clinical Counselor in Laramie, Wy., has volunteered to become the State Director for Wyoming, replacing Ken- neth McLean. Dr. Parnell will also serve in the dual role of Consultant in Counselor Education. She is Chair- 24 man of the Institute for UFO Con- tactee Studies. James A. Scar- borough, Ph.D., a physics professor at Delta State University in Cleveland, Miss., has been promoted from State Section Director to the State Director for Mississippi at the recommendation of G. David Berryhill, Jr. M.D. former State Director. Jim will retain his position as a Consultant in Physics. When Tedra L. Plane moved to Connecticut, a vacancy for State Director was created in South Dakota. Davina M. Ryszka, presently a State Section Director in Custer, S.D., has accepted the challenge to fill this responsibility. Chuck Brooks in Sioux Falls, S.D. plans to continue as Assis- tant State Director. Simon B. Harvey-Wilson, living in Mundaring, has agreed to be the State Director for Western Australia. He will be working with the Continental Coordinator, Harry Griesberg. It is a distinct pleasure to announce that Valeri V. Dvuzhilnyi of Dalnegorsk, Primorskyi region in the U.S.S.R. has accepted the position of Director for Eastern U.S.S.R. Mr. Dvuzhilnyi is also the Director, Eastern Committee UFO USSR, and specializes in landing trace cases. He recently submitted a case that occurred in January 1986 with photographs. Several state directors have responded to the recommenda- tion that they select assistant state directors to share their growing responsiblities in administering to their state members and supervising UFO investigations. Some state di- rectors have appointed state directors for investigations to delegate their duties for a more effective state team. New Assistant State Directors are Laurence T. Childs (Bothel) for Washington; William E. \"Bill\" Knell (Flushing) for New York; Forest Crawford (Collinsville) for Illinois; and Robert B. MacKenna (Wells) for Maine. New state section directors ap- pointed this past month are David \"Phil\" Lord (Jackson Heights) for the Queens in New York; Bobbye L.

Knapp (Rockford) for Joe Daviess, Stephenson and Caroll Counties in Il- linois; John Rinaldo (Cherry Valley) for Winnebago, Boone, Ogle, De Kalb and Henry Counties, Illinois and Poe H. Clark (Ipava) for McDonough and Schuyler Counties in Illinois. Thomas P. Stults, State Director, has also ap- pointed Mr. Rinaldo to the post of State Director for Investigations. David Knapp is amateur radio oeprator KU9L. Ohio State Director Fred W. Hays has added Greene County to the responsibilities of Co- State Section Directors Larry and Peggy Tillman. Additional appointments to State Section Director in Illinois by Tom Stults are Joan Hanley (Ottawa) for LaSalle, Putnam and Grundy Coun- ties, and Wanda Beard (Belleville) for Clinton, Bond and Washington Counties. Due to ill-health Wanda is replacing Mrs. Rosetta Holmes, who is one of the founding members of MUFON in 1969 and the co-host with her husband Dick of ten annual UFO picnics in the Carlyle, 111. area. The MUFON 1978 Symposium Pro- ceedings were dedicated to Rosetta (Rosie) Holmes for her tireless efforts in public relations in behalf of MUFON. When Dr. G. Dave Berryhill (Dublin) relinquished the position of State Director of Mississippi, he was reassigned as the State Section Direc- tor for Coahoma, Quitman and Tunica Counties.
