By Barry Chamish Are the Anakim or the Refaim, the giants of the Bible, returning to Israel today? There are only two periods of recorded history when giants were re- ported in Israel: in Biblical days from the time of the Flood to the ascension of King David, and since 1993 in modern Israel. The case for the return of giants to Israel is airtight. The giants thoughtfully chose reliable wit- nesses, allowed their craft to be filmed, and left in their wake ample physical evidence. In fact, what charac- terizes the current Israeli UFO wave from others in the world is the sheer abundance of physical evidence left behind by the visitors. Consider the first incident to usher Israel into the UFO age. Shikmona Beach On the evening of Sept. 28, 1987, a 27-year- old auto mechanic, Ami Achrai, was driving just south of Haifa when he saw what he thought might be a heli- copter in distress hovering just above the sands of Shikmona Beach on the Mediterranean Sea. He stopped his car, and to his utter amazement saw a disc-shaped craft which emitted a bright red flash before disappear- ing. Two days later he returned to the site with a ufologist the police referred him to, Hadassah Arbel. What they discovered remains one of the most lasting proofs ever left by a UFO of its physical existence. The flash emitted by the craft burned its image into the sands of Shikmona Beach. A 15-meter ellipsoid disk was burnt black into the sand, but what was more in- teresting was what wasn't burned. In the vegetation which wasn't burned was a clear image of the pilot of the craft facing a control board. Seven years later I sent samples of the burnt sand to the television show Sightings, which subjected it to laboratory tests. The sand seemed to melt in the heat of the camera light. The reason later discovered was that the sand particles were covered by a low melting hydrocarbon material. The laboratory could find no natural or human explanation for the phenom- enon. Ami Achrai's incident was followed by a re- peat performance on June 6, 1988, when a similarly- shaped craft was once again burned into the sands of Shikmona Beach, about 100 yards north of the first site. This was followed by the most spectacular dis- play of all. On April 27,1989, two teenagers witnessed a UFO explode into thousands of shards over Shikmona Beach. By now, Israeli ufologists were prepared to handle the latest incident more scientifically. The beach was strewn with burning white metal which was cool to the touch. The metal even glowed in water. When picked up, the shards turned into a white ash. Scien- tists from the Technion Institute of Technology tested the site and found that magnetism was 6,000 times higher than the surrounding area. The shards were found to be very pure magnesium. Two hundred yards above Shikmona Beach is a Biblical shrine called Elijah's cave. Here Elijah preached, and here, or somewhere nearby in the Carmel Mountains, Elijah challenged the Canaanites to a duel of Gods. Two bulls were tethered and the gods were beseeched to roast them. Naturally, Baal failed the Canaanites, but Elijah's God sent a ray of light from heaven which cooked the bull on the spot. This ray may have been similar to the kind of beam which burned the sands of Shikmona Beach into a saucer shape. Within the Cave of Elijah is an ancient draw- ing of something that was the spitting image of the craft burned into the sands below. The Sightings team decided the image \"was a coincidence. Maybe it was a bat.\" When Michael Hesemann filmed the drawing, he left certain it was a match for the burned sand pic- tures. Although the cave drawing's meaning is in dis- pute, the fact of the modern UFO-burned inscriptions is not. Something unique occurred at Shikmona Beach. Alien craft decided to leave souvenirs there at least three times. By doing so, they revealed the dimensions of their craft and apparently pilot, as well as their con- struction material. These were not crop circles nor were they formed the same way. A very different message was left on Shikmona Beach's sands. House lit up After the UFO explosion, there was a hiatus of UFO activity until 1993, broken only once in late 1991 over the village of Sde Moshe, some five miles from Kadima. There, after two straight nights of hav- ing the inside of his house lit up by an unexplained craft hovering above it, Eli Cohen captured the respon- sible UFO on videotape. Several minutes of the tape were filmed after daybreak making the result a most clear and convincing record of a UFO. It seems the visitors were merely scouting the Kadima area in 1991, but they returned in force in 1993. And this time the occupants of the crafts did more than merely hover in the sky. In the early morning of April 20, Tsiporet Carmel's house glowed from within. She"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 July 1998 MUFON UFO Journal stepped outside and saw what she thought was a new fruit silo built outside her back yard. But then she saw the silo add a second story to itself. Ten yards to the side of this magical silo, Tsiporet saw a seven-foot tall being wearing metallic overalls. Its head was covered in what looked like a beekeeper's hat. Tsiporet said, \"Why don't you take off your hat so I can see your face?\" The being answered her telepathically, \"That's the way it is.\" Circle found This was Israel's first publicized close encoun- ter with an alien being. Tsiporet could easily have been made an object of ridicule but for the fact that a circle 4.5 meters in diameter was found exactly where she had seen the craft. Within the circle were shards of a material later found to be a very pure silicon. Israel's ufologists are divided over the veracity of the silicon because there was a prankster loose in Kadima. However, within ten days, two more circles were found just outside Tsiporet's back yard. This time, they were soaked with a red liquid, and this fluid would be a constant feature of upcoming landing circles. It was tested by the National Biological Laboratory in Ness Tziona and found to be composed mostly of cad- mium. This was the end of Tsiporet's incidents. Now the visitors concentrated on two other women in their late thirties living on Hapalmach Street. The first was a Russian immigrant, Mara. Strange forces shook her house so hard they caused the outside airconditioning unit to fall out of its casing into the house. Voices called to Mara in her childhood nickname. Eventually she decided the house was haunted, and she moved far from Kadima. The town treasurer Shosh Yahud is the treasurer of the town of Kadima. She is down to earth and wants as little to do with her UFO experience as possible. In May, she awoke to see a seven-foot, round-faced being in sil- very overalls circling her bed as if \"floating on his shoes.\" The creature assured her he was not there to harm her, and she became relaxed. After a few min- utes the being floated through her wall outside. Shosh thought she had dreamed the incident until she looked out her window in the morning and saw a 4.5 meter crop circle in her backyard. The ufologists descended on her home and discovered silicon and cadmium within the circle. Next, in June, it was Hannah Somech's turn to be visited by a giant. Hannah lives in Burgata, three miles from Kadima. She was startled to see her dog go flying across the kitchen into a wall. She stepped outside to investigate, and her way was stopped by an invisible force. She then saw a seven-foot, round-faced Trace site on Shikmona Beach. being in metallic overalls examining her pickup truck. She said to it, \"What did you do to my dog?\" It an- swered telepathically, \"Go away. I'm busy. I could crush you like an ant if I wanted to. Go back to your husband.\" A 4.5-meter circle crushed out of the grass was later found in Hannah's back yard. Within, the grass was soaked with red liquid cadmium. By the end of the summer, the credible reports of giants roaming the land persuaded the normally staid television station Channel One to broadcast a one-hour program on the subject. Tsiporet and Shosh appeared, as well as the ufologists who had examined the circles of Kadima. To the apparent shock of the host, the view- ing audience believed the advocates of alien landings. The result was two more witnesses coming out into the open. Both were women in their late thirties who lived within ten miles of each other south of Tel Aviv. Clara Kahonov of Holon was most reluctant to be quoted, but acknowledged that she had seen a giant being. Batya Shimon of Rishon Letzion saw far more than one. In early July, two seven-foot tall, bald crea- tures beamed themselves into her seventh floor apart- ment. They told her telepathically not to be frightened, and she immediately relaxed. She then felt they had \"friendly faces.\" They roamed her home, \"floating on their shoes\" and dusting her shelves with a yellow, foul- smelling powder. One being saw her son's aquarium, became very excited, and called his colleague over. After a few minutes, they beamed themselves outside. The next night at 3 a.m., a dozen giants visited Batya, arriving and leaving the same way. I have had extensive conversations with the contactees, and there is much in common with their stories. That is a fit subject for a separate article. In"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1998 Page 5 short, all were the same age, all were white collar work- ers, three have been haunted telepathically since their encounters, all their men slept through the encounters, two had mysterious pregnancies, etc. But the core com- monality is that these women did not know each other, and separately described the same seven-foot tall, bald, round-faced giants. And if absolute proof that giants were about in Israel was needed, it came in December in the village of Yatzitz, twelve miles east of Rishon Letzion. The giants had opened a new axis after Kadima, a triangle of twenty miles linking Rishon Letzion, Holon and Yatzitz. Village security chief Herzl Casatini, the village security chief and his friend Danny Ezra were sharing conversation when they heard an explosion and felt Ezra's house shake. Herzl opened the door and stood face to face with a nine-foot tall creature in metallic clothes whose face was hidden in \"a haze.\" He shut the door and called the police. They arrived and discovered deep boot tracks in the hard mud. The tracks sank 35 centimeters into the ground, meaning whoever made them had to have weighed, literally, a ton. Thinking there might have been a terrorist incursion, the army was called in. Military trackers were totally stumped. The tracks carried on for 8 kilometers. The heel dug in only 5 cm., meaning that whatever made the tracks was walking almost on tip-toes, if you can call it walking. Sometimes the distance between tracks was twelve feet, meaning the intruder was a world record-holding broad jumper weighing about a ton. The Yatzitz incident confirmed, even to the deepest skeptics, that giants were indeed sighted, and they left proof that was nearly impossible to dispute. The best the Israeli authorities could come up with to explain the tracks was that they were left by an un- known cult. It would have to be a very unknown cult, since records of cults whose ceremonies include dress- ing as giants and leaving miles of unidentifiable tracks are undoubtedly quite rare. Other sightings After Yatitz, giant sightings were reported in Ramat Hasharon, Rehovot, and Afula. And 1996 be- came a vintage year for UFO evidence gathering with a good dozen craft filmed. Two incidents stand out. In August, a UFO was filmed over three nights with pro- fessional equipment at Kibbutz Hatzor. The results in- clude a closeup of what appear to be rows of square- shaped vents on the craft. In December, a Netanya household reported constant contact with small greys, the first such report from Israel. The witnesses backed up their claims with an abundance of physical evidence, including stones that melt ice immediately without a UFO over Migdal HaEmek, 1990.

I have touched on just one aspect of it, but it is vital to understanding the Israeli puzzle. Of the seven best documented close encounters with alien beings provably connected to UFOs, six involved gi- ants. These giants were determined to leave evidence of their arrival in the form of cadmium-imbued landing circles, miles of impossible boot tracks, and deliberate communication with witnesses. Indeed, the abundant evidence more than indicates that there are giants roam- ing Israel today, as there were 5,000 years ago, and they also left proof of their existence. Descended from the nefilim The giants were descended from the nefilim, literally the fallen ones. In ancient time, entities fell on Israel from the heavens and later became the mortal enemies of the Hebrew nations. One giant king was Og of Bashan. The Bible records that his bed was thir- teen feet long. Bashan's territory included the Golan Heights. Sitting on the Golan Heights is the Israeli ver- sion of Stonehenge. Called Gilgal Refaim, the Circle of the Refaim (or giants in English), this site consists of five concen- tric rings whose beauty can only be appreciated from above. Unfortunately, there was supposedly no way for the simple nomads of 5,000 years ago to see the circles from above. The site is enormous. The outside circle has a diameter of 159 meters, and over 37,000 tons of rock went into the construction of the complex. Two openings in the circles may have been used to measure the solar solstice and the rising of Sirius in 3,000 BCE. The fact remains that Israeli archaeologists are totally mystified by the Gilgal Refaim. No other com- plex built in the Middle East resembles it, and it pre- dates the pyramids by more than 500 years. The indig- enous nomads of the time did not engage in this kind of megalith building, so outsiders were probably the build- ers. According to the Bible, the only outsiders living on the Golan Heights back then were giants. Maybe it's a longshot, but no one has come up with a better explanation for Israel's current UFO wave. I believe the ancient giants may be coming home. I conclude on a somber note. The Biblical giants were God's enemy, and Israel's armies were the means to their utter destruction. There is a legitimate reason to contemplate the recent rearrival of giants in Israel with a good measure of dread. Water elsewhere in Universe raises expectations of life Editor's Note: This story is based on an As- sociated Press report and a Reuters newswire re- port. LONDON-Orbiting high above Earth, the Eu- ropean Space Agency's Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) has discovered water around distant stars and planets, raising expectations of life elsewhere in the universe. The discovery of water vapor in the atmo- sphere of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, has generated the most excitement, because that moon may dupli- cate the conditions that led to the creation of life on Earth, says Roger Bonnet, the agency's director of sci- ence. \"Now that water has been discovered [on Ti- tan] ... this lends more support to the possibility that we have all the conditions which prevailed on Earth 4.5 billion years ago to give birth to life,\" he said. \"These conditions may also exist on Titan, and the only thing you need is a little heat, and maybe the birth of life may be seen.\" Over the past two and a half years, the ISO has been able to see evidence of water throughout the universe, said Reinhard Genzel, chair- man of the agency's Astronomy Working Group. \"In fact, it has been a spectacular vista to see water every- where.\" The observatory found water around dying stars, newborn stars, in intersteller space, in other galaxies, and in the atmospheres around Mars and all the outer planets, in particular the Titan moon, Genzel said. Athena Coustenis of the Paris Observatory said scien- tists knew Titan's atmosphere contained carbon mon- oxide and carbon dioxide, so they expected water va- por as well. Now that it's been detected, she said, sci- entists hope to study the mysterious moon's organic chemistry. NASA's spacecraft Cassini, which was launched last October, promises the best look yet at Saturn and its moons. When the plutonium-powered spacecraft arrives at Saturn in 2004 after a 2.2 billion-mile jour- ney, it will release the Huygens probe, built by the European Space Agency, which will descend by para- chute for some two and a half hours through the dense atmosphere of Titan, sending back data all the way. With luck, Huygens will land softly enough on Titan's surface to continue sending back more data.

Buzzes and smells in Strieber's Majestic By R. J. Durant Abstract - Persinger's Temporal Lobe Epi- lepsy hypothesis for UFO abduction reports is dis- cussed with emphasis on his list of typical symptoms. A method of applying the list to analyze first-person ac- counts of abductions is dem- onstrated, using Strieber's book Majestic as an ex- ample. If abductions result from TLE episodes, their re- call from memory should re- tain the tell-tale symptoma- tology. A persistent hypoth- esis to explain the abduction R. J. Durant experience is that the abductee suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy. Jacobs (1) dis- cusses the issue in some detail and dismisses it on vari- ous grounds, including the fact that the main propo- nent of the hypothesis failed to study a population of abductees. Jacobs has a client diagnosed as a temporal lobe epileptic, but she showed no abduction symptoms during a seizure he observed in a hypnosis session. Moreover, the client experienced 12 seizures during a period of several days due to the unanticipated reac- tion of a drug she was taking to control the TLE. How- ever, TLE remains one of the few testable hypotheses for abductions, and deserves continued careful con- sideration. The \"higher functions\" The temporal lobes of the brain control what are often called the \"higher functions\" of the mind, namely, \"... accessing declarative memory, the con- scious or active recall of not only what was learned, but when and where it was acquired, and with attribut- ing personal meaning or significance to the constant stream of sensory input. \" (2) The person suffering these temporal lobe sei- zures tends to have experiences that can be character- ized as mystical or paranormal, or to have a sense of very special purpose in life, or he imbues unusual events with great and unrealistic meaning. These are not merely vague and generalized feelings. Often they are extremely intense and at times are described as \"more real than real.\" In some instances the symptoms are so frequent and vivid that a formal diagnosis of temporal lobe epi- lepsy is possible. However, Persinger (3) has demon- strated that there exists a continuum of temporal lobe lability, and that this lability is positively co-related with mystical and paranormal experiences. This con- clusion leaves open the possibility that abductees may be temporal lobe epileptics, but functioning on the con- tinuum beyond our present ability to detect in the clini- cal environment. As with any medical condition, the person af- flicted is not likely to seek help unless the condition is painful or debilitating. A positive diagnosis of TLE is possible, but a negative diagnosis is speculative. It is not within the state of the art of today's medical tech- nology to reach a definite conclusion that any given patient does not have TLE. Strieber tested Whitley Strieber, author of the books Commun- ion (4), Transformation (5), and Majestic (6), under- went two series of tests for TLE. Both showed nega- tive results. Per the remarks above, and by his own admission, that still leaves open the possibility that he does suffer from the condition, but that the TLE epi- sodes occur only sporadically. It is certainly to Strieber's credit that he went to such extreme lengths to preclude a psychiatric foundation for his abduction experiences. In addition to the general characteristics of tem- poral lobe function listed above, there exists a set of intriguing specific symptoms of the epilepsy. They are as follows: (2) 1.Paranormal /mystical experiences. 2.Enhanced imaginings, especially since childhood. S.Widening affect. 4.Vestibular (floating, low frequency vibration) sensa- tions. S.Anomalous smells. 6.1ntense episodes of personal meaning. With this set of symptoms in mind, I scanned most of Strieber's writing, including the horror fiction and his nonfiction, but with particular emphasis de- voted to his three UFO and abduction books. My goal was to determine if there exists in that body of writing a clear and obvious emphasis on language or themes reflecting the six symptoms of TLE. Strieber's works dealing with subjects other than UFOs and abductions reveal none of the symp- toms. Communion and its sequel Transformation can fairly be said to be continuous reiterations of symp- toms 1,2,3,4 (floating), and 6. Majestic is a fictionalized rendering of the Roswell crash and its aftermath. It should be distin-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS July 1998 MUFON UFO Journal guished from the previous two books, which are veridical and autobiographical, dealing specifically with the author's abduction experiences. One would expect Majestic to present no more TLE symptoms than the rest of Strieber's deliberate fiction. The hypothesis urged here is that if the abductions result from TLE episodes, their recall from memory and reduction to writing will retain the tell-tale symptomatology. Most symptoms present My analysis shows that most of the six symp- toms are present, but in greatly reduced intensity, in Majestic where compared to Communion and Trans- formation. But oddly, symptom 4 appears powerfully in complete form, with floating as well as low frequency vibrations, and so is symptom 5, anomalous smells, which is nearly absent in the earlier works, but repeat- edly erupts here. Indeed, so common are references to these two symptoms in Majestic that I have systematically culled them out of the text and listed them serially below. Perhaps their concatenated, seemingly obsessive use is merely a literary device. (Strieber did not reply to my written inquiry on this question.) Certainly Strieber is a master writer perfectly able to invoke all the tricks of his trade to create moods or develop themes, but the relentless use of anomalous sounds and smells in his text appears strained and unnatural. I do not conclude that Whitley Strieber is a temporal lobe epileptic, \"labile\" or otherwise. That would be a leap of logic involving, among other things, an unquestioning acceptance of Persinger's model. In- stead, the purpose of this article is to alert the EAT research community to the set of symptoms published by Persinger, who has spent a great deal of time apply- ing the TLE hypothesis to a variety of anomalous phe- nomena. In addition, my method of analyzing Strieber's writing might serve as a guide to researchers who wish to pursue the TLE hypothesis. Thus the scope and intent of this article is very narrow. It is not meant to \"medicalize\" abductions or to stigmatize abductees as epileptics. Indeed, my opin- ion, which I intend to elaborate in the future, is that the TLE symptoms result from either accidental or delib- erate interaction with highly energetic electromagnetic fields. Sounds and smells The items that follow show each instance I found in Majestic where a vibrating sound and/or smell appears. Neither the sounds nor the smells are anoma- lous in the sense of being injected into an inappropri- ate context, but rather by their obsessive use.

His books are on the shelves of every serious student of abductions— the ground-breaking Missing Time in 1982, Intruders in 1987, and Witnessed in 1996—and he has guided other top researchers, such as Dr. David Jacobs, into the field. In 1989 he founded the Intruders Foundation (IF) to support abductees and the investigation of their reports. He has been honored twice by MUFON, in 1985-86 and in 1987-88, for \"the most outstanding contribution to ufology.\" A New York City painter and sculptor by pro- fession, Hopkins first became interested in UFOs in 1964 when he and other observers saw a daylight disc over Cape Cod, MA. He began actively investigating UFO reports in 1975 with the North Hudson Park Land- ing, only a mile off Broadway, which was a CE-III case. The next year he became involved in his first hypnotic regression. A slow, careful approach \"I didn't do the regression,\" he is quick to note. \"Not then, and not for another seven years. It was 1983 before I felt competent. During those seven years I observed how others proceeded, and I read as much as I could on the subject. Even after I started doing hypnosis, I asked qualified people to observe me. I also tape recorded my sessions and sent the tapes for critiques by people I respected.\" Obviously, Hopkins takes hypnosis seriously, but he points out that simply interviewing witnesses should also be taken seriously. \"There is a tremen- dous psychological subtlety involved in interviewing,\" says Hopkins. \"Empathy, timing, experience, tone of voice—all are important whether you are interviewing a witness or conducting a hypnotic session. I have found that the personality of the interviewer or the hyp- notist is more important than the credentials that per- son has. Psychologists are not necessarily good hyp- notists, though they may be. First and foremost, you have to convince the witness that you are accepting what that person is telling you. Later you may decide you don't believe it, but at the time you must show that you accept it.\" One key to being a good investigator, says Hopkins, is to specialize. \"Specialization is necessary in order to be competent. The generalist simply cannot be competent in a lot of areas, just as medical doctors cannot be competent in a lot of areas.\" Another key to being a good investigator, says Hopkins, is to have no personal agenda. \"When I started,\" says Hopkins, \"I had the ad- vantage of no point of view. I still don't. An investiga- tor can't afford to get wrapped up in a philosophy. If you will look at the evidence, patterns will emerge. Actually, most investigators seem to be getting essen- tially the same information from abductees, but we may emphasize different aspects of that information. In In- truders I was one of the first to point out the aspect of hybrid babies, but the Betty and Barney Hill case in- volved the taking of sperm/ ova samples, so the sexual aspect has been with, us a long time. It just wasn't em- phasized.\" What abduction cases would Hopkins con- sider as among the best? Like most ufologists, hp named the Betty and Barney Hill case, the Travis Walton case, and the Hickson/Parker Pascagoula case, but he also included the Linda Cortile Budd Hopkins case, which was the subject of his book, Witnessed: The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abduc- tions. \"What makes these cases stand out,\" he explains, \"is the fact of multiple witnesses. In the Walton case, for example, it would have required roughly ten people to pull off a hoax. All these cases have stood the test of time. Not one witness has come forward to say any one of these cases was a hoax. In a sense, all these cases have gotten stronger.\" Asked about the much-discussed Roswell case, Hopkins said that this is not an abduction case, and therefore is outside his field somewhat. He noted, how- ever, that he has been called into another possible crash landing case in New Mexico, and that research thus far indicates that a crash did occur there. \"If it hap- pened in New Mexico, which seems probable at this point, then it suggests that other such cases are pos- sible. Knowing Jesse Marcel as I do, I think such a thing probably did happen at Roswell. However, no one case is the deciding factor.\" Respected researchers Who are some researchers in his own field that he respects? \"Well,\" he responds, \"I would have to in- clude John Carpenter, Ray Fowler (though he doesn't do his own hypnotic sessions), John Mack, and, of course, my friend David Jacobs. David has been very courageous. He is one of the few people thinking ahead.\" What does Hopkins think of Jacobs' latest book, The Threat, which states that the aliens are pro-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1998 Page 11 during hybrids lo take over the world, and that there is little, if anything, we can do about it.? \"I couldn't have written that book,\" says Hopkins. \"It's a marvelous book, but it is not in my nature to increase the number of dark clouds over us. I have a 24-year-old daughter who has a career as a photographer, and she is recently married. I like to think that she has the same wonderful possibilities for a future that I had when I was 24 years old. To think that there is this uncaring, powerful thing out there is not something I want her to have to deal with. I don't want her reading my books or David's books. I don't think she has completely read any of my books. She knows this is something I do, but I don't deal with UFOs in great detail with her. And as for David, he hopes he is dead wrong.\" Extremely interested How is Mrs. Hopkins dealing with the UFO question? \"When Carol and I met in 19941 wasn't too anxious for her to know I was in UFO research,\" ad- mits Hopkins. \"She is a film maker and writer. Gradu- ally she became extremely interested. Now she can't understand why everyone isn't interested. I can un- derstand, though. It's just too damned unpleasant.\" How about society in general? Should every- one be kept in the dark? \"A very good question,\" re- sponds Hopkins. \"I put this to a group at a MUFON convention. I said, 'Suppose we are in government and we have absolute proof that the aliens are real, that they are all-powerful, and that we are not certain of their agenda. Do we tell the people?' The majority of those present decided they would have to think it over first. Maybe that is what our government is do- ing. I don't know what might happen if the public is told that the aliens are real and that they are a danger. This question would make a very good sociological survey. Maybe, with the 'X-files' and 'Independence Day' and all the rest, the public is now more ready for such an announcement. I suspect that many people would find some way to ignore it.\" With all the unpleasantness associated with abductions, is Hopkins sorry he got involved? \"Not really,\" he responds, with no hesitation. \"I wish it did not impinge on my work so much, but I think it would be cowardly to ignore something as important as this. Besides, it has enhanced my life. My experience with abductees has been extremely enriching. When I was only observing hypnotic sessions I could only match the abductees' tears with my own tears. Now I can actively help them. This gives me a sense of reward that I could never otherwise find.\" MUFON FORUM Dear Editor, I was glad to discover that you published the text of my speech at the conference in Brasilia on the American documents. I have found an article in the New York Times which is relevant to the debate about military documents. Enclosed is a copy. This article, printed June 29,1947, \"New weapons disclose changed face of war,\" reveals the development of a Russian copy of the B-29: \"The Russians are known to have pro- duced their own version of the B-29, but in range and bomb load our B-50 and B-36 are probably superior to any bombers the Russians-or the British-now have in sight.\" This illustrates again how peculiar was the in- terrogation in the American military documents of the time, prominently the letter signed by Gen. Twining in September 1947, and the Air Intelligence Report of De- cember 1948 about the possibility that the flying disks might be a domestic or foreign project. I proposed in my article that these writings were deceitful at such a high level of authority. They had to know, especially Gen. Twining, how far ahead of current projects those \"flying disks\" were. However, Kevin Randle presents another argu- ment in an article published by IUR (Spring 1998). To him, such interrogations just show that these documents had been prepared by lower ranking staff members who, admittedly, did not have complete access to ev- erything. That is certainly very right, and this approach is sufficient to argue, as Randle does, that \"neither of these documents sounds the death knell for the Roswell case.\"The discovery of the disk was so secret that it could not be revealed there. Now, does that rule out deception? I don't think so. Actually, these writings may have been found to be very convenient by Gen. Twining and by the Directors of Intelligence, Gen. McDonald in 1947, and Gen. Cabell in 1948. who must have all been in the know of a UFO crash, to keep the lid tight on Roswell. In short, that makes now two ar- guments instead of one. Gildas Bourdais Mr. Connelly, I just wanted to drop you a line and say THANK YOU! I was surprised to see a write-up about my research.

Phillips, generally recognized as the top ground traces researcher in the world, has worked on approxi- mately 600 such cases with the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek and the Center for UFO Studies, as well as with MUFON. He had \"retired\" from active work with ground trace cases, but had promised Dr. Hynek that he would revisit the famous Delphos, KS, case. Recently, as he began work on updating that case, he quickly became aware that not enough is being done by UFO research- ers in the important area of ground traces. As researcher Stanton Friedman points out, there have been more than 4,000 trace/landing events recorded, and about 25% of these involved entity reports. \"There is a real need here,\" says Phillips. \"There is a need for responding quickly to the better cases, for utilizing the best equipment and methods, for bringing data together, and for analysing the re- ports.\" MUFON is cooperating with this new project, and MUFON field investigators are asked to cooper- ate fully in getting appropriate reports to Phillips quickly, as well as to MUFON. All data will be entered into a computer data- base and made available at a web site linked to CUFOS, MUFON, and FUFOR, according to Phillips. The data will be updated as material is converted to web site format, and it will be displayed as a basic case listing of one or two-line summaries. Links will be provided for each case, which can then be displayed in full re- port form with sketches and photographs. Statistical studies will be posted as data is compiled. Phillips says that analysis of landing residue will be \"aggressively pursued on a priority basis when gathered or received,\" and that \"all data will be made available, including case reports, follow-up, and analy- sis results.\" The Center expects to take advantage of today's technology. \"Unlike the 1960's and 70's,\" notes Phillips, \"we now have the ability to communicate at incredible speed. Using e-mail as a link, the Center would be in a position to receive new cases almost as they happen. In the high strangeness events, full on- site investigation will be done. We are acquiring re- sources for on-site work at this time. In turn, we would be in a position to communicate with people at a new site immediately to preserve any traces existing there, and to suggest the proper documentation of the site early on. This is extremely important, as some types of traces seem to be of short duration.\" Phillips adds, \"This is a project that we can all participate in and learn from. It is a project that can yield results, since physical traces remain after the observation, they can be documented, they can be stud- ied, and they can be subjected to scientific analysis. After 30 years of trace research I can assure you that this will take time and a lot of work. With the help of the many people needed, we can move ahead and, at the very least, preserve the data for that point in the future when it will be seriously considered.\" Those who would like to be involved with this project should contact Phillips by e-mail at theo2042@gte.net or by letter at HC1—Box 660, Reeds Spring, MO 65737. NASA interested in scientist who is working on gravity shield According to the Columbus, OH, Dispatch newspaper, NASA has invited Russian scientist Eu- gene Podkletnov, who claims that he and his colleagues in Finland have created a device that seems to par- tially shield the pull of gravity, to work with NASA. The scientist, Eugene Podkletnov, was about to publish an article in a British scientific journal two years ago, but a staffer at the publication apparently leaked the story to a British newspaper, which pre- sented it in a sensational manner. Podkletnov's co- author claimed his name was being used without his permission, scientists attacked Podkletnov, and Podkletnov lost his job. At that point he withdrew his research from publication and avoided the press. Scientists at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, AL, reportedly became interested, contacted Podkletnov, and received some preliminary information. But after unsuccessfully trying to dupli- cate Podkletnov's experiments, which allegedly blocked gravity by 2%, they decided that the only thing to do was to bring in Podkletnov himself. He report- edly arrived on May 7. \"Ten years ago, physicists would have said this stuff is Star Trek-impossible to do,\" said NASA's Ron Koczor, associate director of the Space Science Labo- ratory at Marshall Space Flight Center. \"But if Eugene's work can be duplicated independently, this will change totally how the world does business.\" Einstein reportedly believed, but could not prove, that it should be possible to create physical shielding to block gravity waves."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1998 Page 13 Donald E.

Hampton Roads Pub. Co. Charlottesville, VA, 1995 (ISBN 1-57174-027-9), $15.95 Reviewed by Hal Puthoff, Ph.D. Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin, TX To the degree that the engineering characteristics of UFOs can be estimated by empirical observation, in this reviewer's opinion the above-referenced, book by Paul Hill provides the most reliable, concise summary of engineering-type data available.(l) The data were com- piled over decades of re- search by a Chief Scientist- Manager at NASA Langley Research Center (2) who acted as an informal clear- inghouse for UFO-related data. The strength of the compilation lies in its thought- ful separation of wheat from chaff, and the analysis of the former into coherent patterns, including detailed calculations. Perhaps surprising to the casually inter- ested, under careful examination the observations, rather than defying the laws of physics as naive inter- pretation might suggest, instead appear to be solidly commensurate with them, as the following discussion shows. Flight pattern One of the most consistently-observed charac- teristics of UFO flight is a ubiquitous pattern in which they tilt to perform all maneuvers. Specifically, they sit level to hover, tilt forward to move forward, tilt back- ward to stop, bank to turn, and descend by \"falling- leaf'or \"silver dollar wobble\" motions. Detailed analy- sis by Hill shows that such motion is inconsistent with aerodynamic requirements, but totally consistent with some form of repulsive force-field propulsion. Not satisfied with paper analyses alone, Hill arranged to have various forms of jet-supported and rotor-supported circular flying platforms built and tested. Hill himself acted as test pilot in early, origi- nally-classified, versions, and found the above motions the most economical for control purposes. Pictures of these platforms are included in the text. In an effort to examine the force-field propul- sion hypothesis yet further, Hill analyzed a number of cases involving near-field interactions with an appar- ent craft in which some form offeree was in evidence. These include examples in which a person or vehicle was affected, tree branches were parted or broken, roof tiles were dislodged, objects were deflected, and ground or water were disturbed. Repulsive force field Under close analysis, the subtleties of these interactions combine to point unequivocally to a re- pulsive force field surrounding the craft, while discrimi- nating against propulsion mechanisms involving jet action, pure electric or magnetic effects, or the emis- sion of energetic particles or radiation (although the latter may accompany the propulsive mechanism as a secondary effect). Further detailed investigation indicates that the particular form offeree field propulsion that satisfied observational constraints is what Hill labels a directed acceleration field; that is, a field that is, in general, gravitational-like in nature, and, in particular, gravity- canceling.(3) Such a field acts on all masses in its sphere of influence, as does a gravitational field. Cor- ollary to this conclusion is that observed accelerations of 100 g's relative to the environment could be sus- tained without on-board high-g forces. One of the consequences of the above identifi- cation of field propulsion type by Hill is his conclu- sion, supported by detailed calculation, computer simu- lation, and wind-tunnel studies, that supersonic flight through the atmosphere without sonic booms is easily engineered. Manipulation of the acceleration-type force field would, even at supersonic speeds, result in a con- stant-pressure, compression-free zone without shock wave in which the vehicle is surrounded by a subsonic flow-pattern of streamlines, and subsonic velocity ra- tios. An additional benefit of such field control is that drops of moisture, rain, dust, insects, or other low- velocity objects would follow streamline paths around the craft, father than impact it. Another puzzle resolved by Hill's analysis is that craft observed to travel continuously at Mach 4 or 5 do not appear to generate temperatures sufficiently high to be destructive to known materials. In other words, UFOs appear to prevent high aerodynamic heat- ing rates rather than permitting a heating problem to arise, then surviving it with heat-resistant materials, as is the case of the Shuttle, whose surface temperatures can reach 1300 degrees C. No energy deposited The resolution of this potential problem is shown by Hill to derive from the fact that the force- field control that results in the prevention of shock wave drag as discussed above is also effective in preventing aerodynamic heating. In effect the airflow approaches,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1998 Page 15 then springs away from the craft, depositing no energy in the process. A further example of the type of correlation that emerges from Hill's analytical approach is pro- vided by an analysis of the economy of various flight- path profiles. It is shown that high-angle, high-accel- eration departures on ballistic-arc trajectories with high- speed coast segments are more efficient than, for ex- ample, intermediate-level, horizontal-path trips, both in terms of required impulse-per-unit-mass and time- of-flight parameters. This he correlates with the obser- vation that UFO departures are of the dramatically high- angle, high-acceleration type. Plasma sheath Also of interest is Hill's analysis of the spectra and intensity of an apparent plasma sheath surround- ing such craft, the details of which correlate with what one would expect in terms of it being a secondary ef- fect associated with the propulsion system; for example, a blue shift and intensity increase during a \"power-up\" phase, and the opposite during hover and landing ma- neuvers. An additional fine point that emerges from this analysis is resolution of the paradox that observa- tion on a direct line-of-sight to a near part of the craft can reveal a metallic-like structure, while the attempt to observe the outline of the craft, necessarily by an oblique line-of-sight, results in an indistinct blur. Analy- sis shows this to be a reasonable outcome of an ex- pected re-absorption of reflected light by the surround- ing plasma in the longer-length path associated with the more oblique view. Another typical nugget of information is found in Hill's discussion of the results of the analysis of a possible UFO artifact, the famous Ubatuba magnesium fragments claimed to have originated from an exploded unidentified craft near Ubatuba, Brazil. Laboratory analysis of the samples found the magnesium to be not only of exceptional purity and anomalous in its trace composition of other elements, but 6.7% denser than ordinary pure magnesium, a figure well beyond the experimental error of the measurement. Pure isotope Hill's calculation shows that this observation can be accounted for by assuming that the sample con- tained only the pure isotope Mg-26, rather than the naturally-occurring distribution among isotopes Mg- 24, Mg-25, and Mg-26. Since the only isotope separa- tion on a significant scale in terrestrial manufacture is that of uranium, such a result must be considered at least anomalous, and possibly as evidence for extra- terrestrial manufacture. Additional calculations concerning the param- eters of interstellar travel (including relativistic effects), and the energetics of such travel, have been performed and are included in tabular and graphical form. The wealth of material in these sections, along with discus- sion of the broad implications of this material, reveal the dedication and thoroughness of Hill's approach to his self-assigned task. In the final analysis, one must conclude that Hill has assembled as good a case as can be made on the basis of presently available data that the observa- tion of some \"unconventional flying objects\" is com- patible with the presence of engineered platforms weighing in at something around 30 tons which are capable of 100-g accelerations and 9000-mph speeds in the atmosphere. Perhaps more important for the tech- nical reader, however, is Hill's supporting argumenta- tion, based on solid analysis, that these platforms, al- though exhibiting the application of physics and engi- neering principles clearly beyond our present-day ca- pabilities, do not appear to defy these principles in any fundamental way.

Some form of distortion-heat, or other energy field-obscured a clear view of its top and bottom sur- faces. After following the object about 0.75 miles, the two lost sight of it in the hills. \"When we got over the hill it was absolutely nowhere in sight.\" LOG # 971202SE, MA-1, Spring/95, Hogansville, GA, at 23:30 hours EOT, 04:30GMT, for 20 min- utes.

Thompson A husband and wife were driving southwest- ward on Norwood Road and approaching a Y inter- section when they noticed a greenish-yellow light mov- ing out of the woods on the opposite side of the left-angling road and heading in their direction. They stopped to watch the car-sized orb, which hovered for 10-15 minutes over the trees at the edge of the woods. It ascended and flew soundlessly and very slowly di- rectly over them and on to the northeast. LOG # 980106SE, CE-1, Summer/69, West Point, AL, at 22:15 hours CDT, 03:15 GMT, for 5 min- utes.

Upon approaching one of them, they saw a circle of lights hovering just over the treetops at the edge of the water on the north side of the bridge. They stopped the car about 25 yards away to get a close look. To them, the circle of white lights seemed to be around a solid object, but they could not be sure. The diameter was about the size of a saucer at arm's length (real size of 15-20 feet diameter). A minute later, another identical circle came from behind the first and hovered beside it. The woman witness grabbed her flashlight and beamed it toward the two circles. She could not see the beam reflecting from a surface. Fearing their detection by the unusual crafts, her husband pushed her hand down and told her to stop. Immediately, one object moved away from the other, went from an almost standstill to a high speed, and soundlessly zipped over their car. Momentarily, the second ring followed. The witnesses watched the two recede to the south and upward, disappearing in the distance in a few seconds. Shaken by the incident, the two concealed their experience for 29 years.

She did not stop to scrutinize it more closely, but believed it to be the same as a re-entry capsule shape photographed on Sept. 16, 1996.

She turned away to call to her employer, who was suffering the aftermaths of a stroke. When she turned back, the object was gone, and the sea beneath was dark. About thirty minutes later it again appeared over the same area. Another light became visible to the right and above the first. The second light dropped beneath the first, then moved up toward it. As they appeared to merge, both lights disappeared."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1998 Page 17 Why no consensus on a psychological feature? By Chris Styles MUFON Asst. Provincial Director, Nova Scotia, Canada Fifty years after the dawn of the modern UFO era the extraterrestrial hypothesis remains a theory. \"Nuts and bolts\" ufologists continue to search for a definiti ve artifact or document that would serve as proof to even the most demanding skeptic. Against the back- drop of this ongoing melodrama, many UFO research- ers, psychologists and authors prefer to move beyond questions about the validity of the Extraterrestrial Hy- pothesis or point-of-origin speculation, and instead ex- amine the fascinating stories told by abduction claim- ants. In 1990's ufology, many abduction researchers claim that millions of North Americans experience close encounters with aliens. This large group includes mem- bers of both sexes, and all ages and backgrounds. Therefore, one would expect to find a \"typical\" abductee. But what about an abductee's state of mind? Wouldn't such an unusual experience have a profound psychological impact and perhaps leave some typical \"scars\"? Most abduction researchers claim that there is such a range of reactions and personality types that one should not expect to discover a definitive psycho- logical feature that would present itself from any data- base analysis of abductee interview information. Why not? Consider the astounding accomplishments of mod- ern criminal profiling techniques. Even in its infancy, profiling proved an invaluable aid to police in Atlanta, GA, who were searching for a serial killer who was thought to be responsible for the deaths of more than 20 children. FBI criminal profilers applied their tech- niques, combining them with traditional police meth- ods and narrowed the focus of the investigation. The perpetrator was soon apprehended, largely due to the fact that he fit the predicted profile so exactly. After Atlanta, criminal profiling quickly gained acceptance by law enforcement agencies everywhere. We are what we react to in our life experiences. This is a cornerstone belief of criminal profilers. If pro- filing techniques can discern individuals of deviant behavior hiding in cities of millions, why can't UFO researchers agree upon a set of psychological traits that could serve to separate bogus abductee claimants from those individuals who may have had a genuine CE-3 or CE4 experience? Why is this so difficult? Is any- body looking? I concede that many professionals working with abductee claimants do so in the role of therapist. They have little or no concern as to whether or not the patient's experiences are wholly internalized. But for those who claim to study the phenomena, wouldn't it be useful to be able to detect delusion? Without any screening of the data before it is thrown into the hop- per, we are at considerable risk of diluting the truth. And just what is the truth? The truth is what really happened. It's just that simple. Most of my own UFO research has involved both classic and current cases that have occurred in eastern Canada. They range from 30-year-old cases, such as the Shag Harbour UFO crash/retrieval, to current CE- 1, 2 and 3 cases that are lesser known outside of their local area. Time and again I find significant trends in the way witnesses react to UFO encounters and sightings, even in undramatic CE-1 sightings that fea- ture corroboration and documentation. However, these same fascinating reactions seem curiously absent or diminished in cases that lack corroboration and/or cred- ibility. The most striking and prevalent emotional re- action that I encounter on UFO investigations-though by no means the only one that I feel serves as an indi- cator of being a true witness to a genuine UFO inci- dent-is what I call the \"fear and regret response.\" It never fails to amaze me how often I've heard odd com- binations of reactions from reliable and corroborated witnesses. A typical example would be something like, \"I was so scared by the sighting that I felt physically ill,\" and then, \"No, I've never seen anything like it before. I don't think that I'll be lucky enough to see something like that twice.\" These combinations of op- posing reactions are even more striking when heard from witnesses such as law enforcement officers or pilots. It's as if the witnesses and experiencers are at a loss to articulate what in other cultures and times might have been referred to as a numinous experience, (numinous: appealing to the higher emotions or the aes- thetic sense in a mysterious way.) For those readers who wish to better understand the full meaning of numinous or to consider the true impact of those things that still produce awe in the hu- man mind (such as the possibility of alien contact), I recommend Rudolf Otto's seminal work of theology and psychology, The Idea of the Holy. It even im- pressed the late celebrity astronomer Carl Sagan, and is mentioned in the introduction of his novel, Contact. Why is there no definitive psychological marker and why has nothing concrete about the abduction phe- nomena been discovered from the thousands of forms that have been filled out by abductee claimants? I be- lieve it is because any such database is tainted. Why? Because those who compile the data choose not to"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 July 1998 MUFON UFO Journal screen for bogus claims. It is true that if one only used data from those incidents that had some independent corroboration and documentation, a couple of things would happen. First, there would be a lot less data to examine, and, yes, one would surely lose some legitimate data from those who are truthful but are unfortunately the participant in an uncorroborated event through no fault of their own. However, what remained as a database would be far more likely to hold legitimate details that should better reveal the true nature of the abduction phenom- ena. Would this pared-down database prove useful? I don't know, but it would be interesting to see. Abduction research is not my area of exper- tise. Neither is music journalism, but I also feel that I have the right to ask what Elvis had to do with Rock and Roll. I also feel that I have the right to ask what does most abduction research have to do with the UFO phenomena? Separating details of possibly genuine CE- 3 and CE-4 experiences from the many bogus stories N of fantasy-prone attention seekers might bring us a step closer towards making my question redundant. PS. I would love to find a verifiable pre-six- ties diary that unquestionably described a UFO abduc- tion experience. Wouldn't you? Hollywood takes advantage of belief in UFO's NEW YORK, (June 9) IPS - Aliens are everywhere, at least in the United States-where the number of people who believe in Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) outnumbers those who voted for Ronald Reagan, George Bush, or Bill Clinton. Hollywood has benefitted from such strong belief in aliens, with dozens of movies in re- cent years catering to the notion that aliens actually dwell on this planet. Hollywood's alien fever shows no sign of abating. In June, writer-director Chris Carter delivered the first movie version of his popular Fox- TV television series, \"The X-Files.\" The show and film revolve around two FBI agents whose search for aliens lead them to uncover vast government conspira- cies. However, some observers wonder what this interest in aliens says about the sanity of popular culture. At least one, Jodi Dean, author of a new book, Aliens in America: Conspiracy Cultures from Outer Space to Cyberspace (Cornell Press) finds some of the UFO mania healthy. \"During times of uncertainty and instability, people blame distinct groups,\" says Dean, a professor at New York's Hobart and William Smith Colleges. \"Aliens are a safe outlet for a lot of anger and fear.\" MUFON FORUM Letters to Mufon UFO Journal ->V.~ - '• /,.V •- *•<.=?- . .-,,.„.,,. *T , ,- ;.-. , - o Dear Editor Connelly, I would like to post a brief addendum to the cor- rections made by Philip Klass (MUFON Forum, May, 1998, p. 19) to statements in the series by Bourdais (pt. 3, March, 1998). As Klass states, disagreement existed among top CIA officers (e.g., H.M. Chadwell and James Reber); however, in one important communication, a draft letter prepared by Reber for the Director of Cen- tral Intelligence to forward to the secretary of defense (alternately, the NSC) over the DCI's signature, the views he conveyed were not far removed from those of Chadwell. The most clear-cut disagreement centered on whether the DCI should go directly to the National Se- curity Council and obtain the authority to structure a UFO project, as urged by Chadwell, or whether a pro- posed project should first be considered by represen- tatives of Air Force Intelligence and its companion intelligence departments (State, Army, Navy, AEC, Joint Staff, and FBI) comprising the Intelligence Advisory Committee (lAC)-Reber's suggested course of action. Reber's view prevailed, and one of the lAC's stipu- lations was that the conclusions of the forthcoming panel of scientists should determine \"in some measure\" whether the CIA's projected National Security Council Intelligence Directive (NSCID) would materialize. Reber was not a scientist. Holding a Ph.D. in inter- national relations, he had served with the Department of State for the seven years preceding his CIA duty. As the CIA's assistant director for intelligence coordina- tion, he was closely involved with the IAC departments and was certainly aware of their long-standing resistance to what was perceived, especially by the military branches, as CIA intrusion into their intelligence com- petencies. We may ask why DCI Smith apparently concurred with Reber in December, 1952, after having questioned the objectivity of the Air Force in August, at which time he first directed the preparation of the flying saucer NSCID.

Some of the world's leading astronomers re- vealed in June that they have collected more than 100 unexplained radio signals during routine surveillance of space. These faint, pure tones have no natural origin and could have been created artificially, the scientists said. They do not rule out the possibility that this strange radio traffic could have extra-terrestrial origins. Most of the signals have been picked up by American radio telescopes managed by the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI) in Moun- tain View, CA, set up in 1988 to study radio static in space and scan it for material that could be evidence of alien contact. A few have also been logged by British astronomers studying stars and galaxies with the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank, nearMacclesfieldin Cheshire. \"It's tempting to hypothesise,\" says Dr. Seth Shostak, SETI's public programs scientist, \"that at least some of these seductive signals were truly from ET and that they vanished from the ether when the extra-ter- restrials turned off their transmitters or otherwise went off air before we could verify the message.\" Alterna- tively, he said, it was possible they were simply the product of some kind of local interference that did not repeat when the astronomers tried to relocate the rogue signals. SETI, which was formed by scientists, includ- ing Carl Sagan, and received funding from NASA until 1993, has yet to discover any clear, repeated radio pat- tern that might hint at the existence of alien intelligence in the Universe. The short, indistinct signals that have been de- tected are a far cry from the resounding pulses featured in the movie Contact, in which Jodie Foster played a SETI astronomer who deciphered radio contact with aliens. Foster's signed photograph is pinned to a wall in SETI's Silicon Valley office. None of the signals has been heard by human ears-they were all picked up by computers monitoring radio telescopes. \"If you could hear the signal at the frequency it is received, it would sound like a faint whistle, a pure tone which could only be made by a transmitter. As far as we know, nature can't make a pure sound,\" said Shostak. Each time one of these sig- nals is detected by a radio telescope, an alarm alerts SETI astronomers, who work around the clock. None has yet been pinpointed or recorded a second time, so that scientists have been denied the chance of making a study of their source or composition. SETI is stepping up efforts to increase its chances of relocating one of these signals and has se- cured agreement to use the world's largest radio tele- scope-which was featured in the James Bond film GoldenEye-at Arecibo in Puerto Rico. Americans are also negotiating with British astronomers to launch a five-year project to allow speedy verification and track- ing of these elusive noises. Whenever SETI identifies a suspect signal, radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank will scan the same section of the sky to locate it. In this way the scien- tists can rule out possible terrestrial interference from radar, traffic and even electric fences as a cause. \"I'm sure there are signals that have come and gone that we couldn't get to the bottom of. That's not to say it's little green men trying to communicate with us, but we just don't know,\" said Dr. Tom Muxlow, an as- tronomer at the British radio astronomy observatory. He disclosed that Jodrell Bank had picked up about six rogue signals. The possibility that the signals have extra-ter- restrial origins cannot be ignored, according to Nobel laureate Tony Hewish, emeritus professor of radio as- tronomy at Cambridge University. In 1967 Hewish and Jocelyn Bell, a student, believed they had found evi- dence of an alien first contact when they detected a regular pulse of radio signals coming from a distant star. \"It all had an air of unreality about it, but for a month we thought it was possible that the signals were coming from intelligent life on another planet. When radio astronomers pick up signals that are very pecu- liar they take it with a big pinch of salt, but you cannot remove the possibility,\" said Hewish. Instead, they had found a pulsar, a rapidly spinning neutron star, a dis- covery for which Hewish won a Nobel prize in 1974. Shostak is not put off by the prospect that any signal from an alien world would probably be indeci- pherable. \"If we heard from an ET it would be from a civilisation that is a long way ahead of us, maybe even a million years more advanced than we are,\" he said.

Al- though the article was widely circulated and came to the editor through the appropriate MUFON channels, there were elements present which should have raised a red flag. Unfortunately, this did not occur-for either editor. Following is the best information we have to date, based heavily on an Internet posting by Dr. Edoardo Russo, former MUFON representative for Italy, who interviewed Corrado Balducci, the theolo- gian in question. Other sources were also consulted. Additional pertinent material will be printed when, and if, it becomes available. Point one is that Monsignor Balducci says he is not a \"Vatican theologian,\" as reported. He is a Catholic theologian, but is not working at the Vatican. He is now retired. He denies having the intent or au- thority to speak for the Vatican. Point two is that he is not, according to Monsignor Balducci, a member of any secret Vatican commission concerned with ET con- tacts, and he denies passing any information regarding ETs or UFOs to the Vatican. He says he feels sure that no Vatican commission on ET contacts exists. Point three is his stated opinion that Vatican embassies are not engaged in collecting ET contact data and passing it on to the Vatican, as reported, saying that they have better things to do. Monsignor Balducci has appeared on TV pro- grams over the past few years, and has discussed UFOs and ETs, as reported. He does specialize in demonol- ogy, and says his current concerns include New Age beliefs and new religions. He has stated that the testi- monies of witnesses regarding UFOs and ETs indicate that \"prudence dictates that one is careful not to deny\" that these things exist. He further suggests that these beings may be spiritually superior to us, and that con- tact might be desirable. So far as consequences for religion, Monsignor Balducci reportedly said in a 1995 film interview with Bruno Mobrici for RAI-TV that \"there isn't any nega- tive consequence. Everything is included. Surely the Lord has not revealed everything to us. Christ always remains the center of the Universe, but in the Universe there is everything, not only the world, but also thou- sands of stars. It is probable that there are other beings which have a soul, let us say, which is less attached, less subject to the body, and capable of more advanced things than we are.\" Whitley Strieber, who interviewed Monsignor Balducci for his latest book, Confirmation, says that much of what Monsignor Balducci has been saying about the visitors was accurately presented in the pre- vious article. According to Strieber, Monsignor Balducci \"makes substantially the same statements about the need to stop fooling ourselves that the con- tact situation is psychological, and he makes the point that it is dangerous for Christians to ignore the testi- mony of millions....He also discusses his contention that the visitors are not demons, and mentions that the sub- ject matter is of special interest to the Church and the Christian community.\" Strieber adds, \"Monsignor Balducci told me personally when I asked him about his relationship with the Pope that he knows the Pope and is friendly with him. When I asked him if the Pope was aware of his views on UFOs, he said that they had not discussed the matter per se, but had talked about issues of demonol- ogy.\" Finally, Strieber says that Monsignor Balducci is \"an expert on demonology. He has published on the subject, and has been the exorcist for the Archdiocese of Rome. It is because of his expertise in this field that there is reason for Christians to regard his views on the question of whether or not the visitors are demons as an authoritative one.\" Strieber says that Monsignor Balducci \"personally read and agreed with every de- tail of the translation, and it is completely accurate.\" Veteran newsperson McClendon does story on UFOs, secrecy Senior Washington newsperson Sarah McClendon, who has covered 11 Presidents, has re- ported that \"a community of scientists and technicians employed by the government\" believe that UFO's \"are actual visitors from other worlds.\" She continues 1 \"The real danger to the U.S. and perhaps the whole planet is the government has placed such a heavy blanket ol secrecy upon this issue. So much secrecy, those in government who have knowl- edge showing UFOs are identifiable feel the subject cannot be discussed by those in the know without seri- ous repercussions. Others are afraid their friends and co-workers will think they are crazy if they even so much as insinuate that UFOs are identifiable as manned craft from outside the earth. This particularly applies to newspaper editors and publishers, reporters, and ana- lysts. Thus the U.S. is denying itself the chance to learn more about UFOs or to encourage research despite the fact the U.S. stands to gain from such discussions. \"Not publicized but true is that the Clinton ad- ministration, soon after coming to office, had many briefings on the subject.\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 1998 Page 21 MUFON 1998 UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS Published papers by speakers: Ann Druffel; David M.

The big planet is near the gibbous Moon on the 10th. Saturn (0.1), in Cetus, rises in the E about 10:30 p.m. in midmonth. In August and September its ring system reaches its maximum tilt for the year, 16.7 de- grees, with the S side exposed to view. On Aug. 16 Saturn joins its big brother lupiterby beginning retro- grade motion westward. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) becomes more difficult to observe, rising in the ENE soon after 4 a.m. by mid-August and about 4:45 by month's end. Our brilliant planet neigh- bor lies near Mars on the 5th, near the lunar crescent on the 20th, and near Mercury on the 30th. (on that date Mercury is less than 3 degrees to the right of Ve- nus.) Mars (1.7), moving from Gemini into Cancer, precedes Venus by rising in the ENE about 3:30 a.m. in midmonth. Use the brighter planet to locate Mars. Jupiter advances to the SE at dawn. Saturn moves to the S at dawn. Meteor Shower: Unfortunately this year the bright gibbous Moon severely hampers viewing of the Perseids at maximum on the morning of Aug. 13, so the normal peak rate of 50 to 100 meteors per hour will not be seen. The shower can be observed into late August, but in decreasing numbers. € Moon Phases: Full moon-August 7 Last quarter-August 14 New moon-August 21 First quarter-August 30 The Stars: During the late evening, Vega (in Lyra the Harp), the brightest star in the Summer Triangle, lies almost directly overhead on the celestial meridian. Flanking it to the E are its two other companions in the Triangle, Deneb (in Cygnus the Swan) and Altair (in Aquila the Eagle). This is a good time for small-telescope users to locate the site of the first and best known candidate for a black hole. Find the 4th-magnitude star Eta Cygni in the neck of Cygnus. In the same field of a low-power eyepiece, look less than half a degree to the NE (to the lower right in an inverted telescope field) and spot a close pair of faint stars, one above the other. The up- per and brighter (9th magnitude) of the two is the vis- ible supergiant component of the black hole Cygnus X-l. The invisible object is thought to be vacuuming matter off its visible neighbor. A black hole is the end- point in the life of some supermassive stars which ex- plode and then collapse into a gravitationally intense \"tiny\" object where even light cannot escape from it. Scientist says life will be discovered Dr. Alistair Glasse, of the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh, a telescope specialist on the Darwin Mis- sion, says life will be discovered on planets going around other stars before the middle of the next cen- tury.

FOREIGN MEMBERSHIP/SUBSCRIPTION PRICE TO BE INCREASED Based upon the \"Membership Journal Survey\" re- cently conducted, it was the consensus of the vast num- ber of members responding that the foreign member- ship / subscription rate should be increased to $35, consistant with the larger postage charges for mailing to foreign countries. Most magazines charge this dif- ferential rate to foreign subscribers. MUFON was ba- sically subsidizing a portion of the postage. This is an advance notice that the $35 rate will become effective immediately for new members and August 1-8, 2nd Annual \"Summer Seminars - Man's Place in the Cosmos,\" in Laughlin, Nevada.

Workshops were scheduled for those arriving early and for local people on June 25 and 26: a new innovation. The star party, in conjunc- tion with the reception-buffet on Friday evening, was a wonderful opportunity to not only meet the speak- ers, but to renew friendships and get acquainted with new folks. Our thanks to the following speakers who made the symposium an educational event of the first mag- nitude: Michael P. Lindemann, Ann Druffel; Jaime Maussan; Deborah Lindemann; Stanley V. McDaniel; David M. Jacobs, Ph.D.; Joe Lewels, Ph.D.; Jose Escamilla; Tracy Torme; Richard F. Haines, Ph.D.; Nancy Talbot; and John F. Schuessler. The titles of their presentations were published in the May 1998 issue of the Journal. For those of you who were unable to attend our annual symposium, the speeches have been published in the MUFON International UFO Symposium Pro- ceedings, that may be obtained from MUFON in Seguin, Texas for $25.00 plus $1.75 for postage and handling. Both video and audio tapes were produced at the symposium by the contractor: Backcountry Pro- ductions, 831 Alpine St.. Longmont, CO 80501; tele- phone: 303-772-8358. Orders from attendees were taken at the symposium, however, at this writing, I am unable to provide the details on the cost for ordering tapes by mail. This information is available now from Backcountry Productions. It will be announced in the August issue of the Journal. The 1998 Symposium Proceedings are respectfully dedicated to Thomas P. Deuley for his dedicated vol- unteer work to MUFON for 21 years. NEW OFFICERS Leonardo Amoroso (Montevideo) was recently appointed MUFON's Representative for Uruguay. Scott R. Voight (Elizabethtown), Kentucky State Di- rector, selected two Assistant State Directors who are both state section directors; Kathy C. Smith (Shelbyville) for Western Kentucky and Jodie E. Turner, Sr. (Franklin) for Southern Kentucky. New State Section Directors designated this month were Marie Arrendo (Granite, OK); Mamie B. Russell, B.A. (Snyder, OK); Robert \"Pete\" Hartinger (Circleville, OH); and Laura L. Miller (Manassas, VA). Mike N. Gold, J.D. (Philadelphia, PA) became a Consultant in Law. PROMOTIONS TO FIELD INVESTIGATOR Two gentlemen passed the MUFON Field Investigator's Exam this month. They were Bruce Crabtree, B.S. (Denton, TX) and Andy Pace (Rye Brook, NY). VACANCIES ON MUFON BOARD OF DIRECTORS Due to the resignation of Mrs. Linda Murphy as Director of Public Education, a vacancy now exists on the MUFON Board of Directors for a person with both an educational background and a sincere interest in educating the public on the UFO phenomenon. Next to resolving the UFO enigma, MUFON's second prime goal is public education. For anyone interested in fill- ing this important position, please mail a resume stat- ing your qualifications and why you would like to be- come involved in this responsibility to Walt Andrus. MUFON is still seeking a Membership Director on the Board to not only devise programs to recruit new members, but to analyze and reduce the number of members who are not renewing their annual mem- berships. We recognize that computer web sites, e-mail announcements, newsstand UFO magazines, etc. con- stitute our most significant competition. However, the Journal is still the best source of reliable information, even though it may not be as \"exciting\" as the trash appearing on some of the web sites, e-mail rumors, and a particular late night radio talk show. MUFON needs a dynamic and qualified person to fill the volun- tary position of Membership Director. Applicants should write to Walt Andrus, including resume and your reasons for volunteering for this board position. These are two opportunities for interested individu- als to become more involved with the leadership of the Mutual UFO Network and to promote UFOIogy. AWARD FOR SECURING NEW MEMBERS Numerous MUFON members shared their interest in the MUFON UFO Journal by purchasing Christ- mas gift subscriptions for friends and relatives. We are extending this idea with a new concept to increase our overall membership. Any current MUFON member will be awarded a lapel pin if they solicit two new members by completing the enclosed form (page 22 (Continued on Page 23)"}]
