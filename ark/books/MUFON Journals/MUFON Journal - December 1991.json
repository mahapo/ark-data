Canada's first full year of crop circle reports was 1990, in which we covered quite a bit of evolutionary ground. The first reports of 1990 were very simple, single-swirl crop circles. Before the season ended, we had braided double ringers with crossbars and pathways and other highly interesting configura- tions. Unfortunately, for all their complexity and rapid evolu- tion, these reports got very little mention in the journals of the international cerealogical community. \"Canada had some, too\" was basically all that was said. The 1991 season was another evolutionary jump of major importance. Circles reports per se were the exception rather than the rule; nearly all reports were of agriglyphs. The first circle of the 1991 season was discovered over the Easter weekend in Fort Lawrence, Nova Scotia. Although this was most probably a leftover from the previous year which had lain under the snow undetected, this early discovery did cause Canadian ufologists and cerealogists to expect a very early and prolific crop circle season. We were as prepared as possible, and we had good information and reporting net- works in place. However, when the circle onslaught did ar- rive, it was neither early, nor particularly prolific. It was, however, remarkable. OPENING CREDITS This article is based for the most part on the onsite investiga- tions of UFO*BC's intrepid veteran cerealogist, Chad Deetken. Mr. Deetken spent nearly six days in the Lethbridge area, crawling through circle formations, interviewing wit- nesses, taking both aerial and ground-level photographs, and gathering soil and grain samples. In addition, he has arranged for many of the laboratory tests of the samples which are now being done. Although the main purpose of this article is to bring this information to the ufological and cerealogical com- munities, hopefully it can also be considered a small tribute to Chad's dedication to the subject and his desire for the free exchange of information. Special thanks are also due Gordon Kijek of the Alberta UFO Study Group (AUFOSG), for additional information on the Lethbridge-TV event and others, and in particular, for data on the questionable Okotoks formation, which we were unable to investigate. Also, a debt of gratitude is owed the farmers on whose pro- perty the various crop circle formations were discovered, the Lethbridge Herald and other media outlets, and the residents in and around Lethbridge, Alberta, for their willingness to help, their hospitality and their honesty. Photos by Chad Deetken MEDIA GROUPIES The first stars of our Alberta miniseries were not exactly shy. In fact, they were discovered hanging out at the local televi- sion station ... At about 3:00 p.m. on August, 21 1991, farmer Hugh Laycock was swathing his wheat crop, when he saw a large flattened circle in the grain. He soon realized that there was quite a bit more to be seen: about 10.7 meters south of the circle was a formation of three more circles which were con- nected by corridors, a triple-dumbbell configuration. Mr. Laycock immediately shut down his combine, and went to MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"S^.^%^ .•- '^\\ v } Formation in Farmer Fred Watmough's Field.

This was not exactly a difficult task, since the circle formation was only 50 meters from the front door of the Lethbridge television station, CFCN-TV. When people from the news department saw the formation, they immediately contacted several agencies, including Agri- culture Canada, the Lethbridge Astronomical Society, the Lethbridge Police, and AUFOSG. The area was cordoned off pending the arrival of investigators, and then the story hit the airwaves. As for the formation itself, the northern, free-standing, cir- cle was flattened anti-clockwise, as were the two outermost circles of the formation. The large, center circle of the dumb- bell was flattened clockwise; the grain within the corridors was flattened outward towards the smaller satellite circles. The formation was definitely not symmetrical, nor were the circles perfectly round. The grain in the circles was extremely brit- tle, and broke easily when stepped on, yet there were no broken stalks at all inside the formation. Soil samples were taken, and are being analyzed by Alberta Agriculture. Several informal tests were conducted at this site, all with negative results. A compass was taken into each circle, and no effects were registered. Voice recordings were made, and no background noises were heard. And, finally, one of those controversial animal experiments was attempted: a dog was taken for a stroll through the circles. This elicited no reaction whatsoever (at least from the dog). There were at least five reports of anomalous lights seen in the area during the week prior to the discovery of this for- mation. AUFOSG is awaiting the return of the report forms for further information. This first reported formation, situated right outside the local television station, was actually within Lethbridge City Limits. As unusual as this may seem, it is not the first time this has happened. In 1990, a crop circle was reported in St. Francois Xavier, Manitoba, which is technically within Winnipeg City Limits. There is a very interesting point to be noted here. In both these instances where a circle was discovered within city limits, it was the very first event to be reported in what would ultimately be a continuing series of crop circle reports. OKOTOKS HOAX? At about 8:00 a.m. on August 27, 1991, a crop circle forma- tion was discovered in a barley field in Okotoks, Alberta, just south of Calgary, but about 130 kilometers north-northwest of Lethbridge. By the time it was reported to the owner of the field, it was well-trampled by the curious. There are many aspects of this formation which raise doubts as to its legitimacy. First of all, it was a near-duplicate of the Lethbridge/TV station triple-dumbbell formation of six days earlier. There was disturbed dirt near the center of one of the satellite circles, and another had a dirt fracture running through the center. The largest circle was not neatly formed, and one section of the circumference was perfectly straight, rather than curved, for a distance of 5.5 meters. As well, there was what appeared to be a partially-started circle about 20 meters from the main The Eddy-Effect / Chad Deetken formation. In this circle, the barley was bent over at a height of about one foot. 2 Of course, this is certainly not conclusive proof that the formation was hoaxed, but does lend credence to that hypothesis. There were no known UFO reports in the area at the time, nor were there any of the alleged \"paranormal\" effects reported which were to become a regular feature of the Alberta crop circle events. By September 1. circle reports were coming in from all over the Lethbridge area. It is impossible to say exactly when each of the formations were made, but in no case would it have been more than four days prior to discovery. In same cases, the owners of the farms exhibited extraordinary presence of mind in preserving the site until researchers could arrive. Un- fortunately, this was not always the case, and some sites were swathed; even so, this did not hamper efforts to take accurate measurements and secure soil samples. One of the formations to fall prey to the swath was on the Hubbard farm, across from the complex Watmough agriglyph, to be discussed later. The Hubbard formation was a simple MUPON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"check mark\" or \"V\" shape, consisting of three circles con- nected by two corridors, which meet at right angles. The two outer circles were swirled anticlockwise, and the center one clockwise. Of particular interest here is the fact that one outer circle is not a circle at all. Although most crop circles are not perfect circles, here we have a true oval, with axial measurements of 9 feet by 12 feet 8 inches. Another configuration that was given an unwelcome hair- cut was the one on Jenny Skinner's farm. This was an extremely interesting triangular pattern of three circles; a \"T\" shape with a cross bar connected the circles, all of which were swirled anticlockwise. Unusual features here were a \"kink\" in one of the connecting corridors, and the fact that the grain in both of the crossbars was parted, and was flattened in opposing directions. WARNER BROTHERS Perhaps the most beautiful formation of all is the \"Four Brother\" quadruplet in Warner, outside of Lethbridge. In terms of complexity, it is the simplest of our miniseries. In terms of strangeness and of peripheral effects, it is by far the most complex. This grouping is simply four classic circles in an unequal cross configuration, two circles swirled anticlockwise on one diagonal, and two swirled clockwise on the other. When they were discovered by fanner Roy Tetzlaf, he immediately com- bined all around the formation to preserve it, and by doing so, effectively isolated it from the rest of the field. Artistical- ly, the result is arguably the most beautiful set of crop circles yet recorded in North America. The field was thickly planted with wheat; it was a rich brown in color, and ready for harvest. There were no tramlines or other landmarks to break up the seamless stretch of grain, and it was into this pristine tableau that, somehow, four perfectly- etched circles were deposited. There was not a single trace of any kind of ground activity anywhere around these circles. Once again, the flattened grain was so dry and brittle inside the circles that the lightest step would break it, yet there was absolutely no sign of any distur- bance. The grain had been laid down in several layers: one layer would be set down at an angle to the previous one, and then the effect would be repeated. Again, some single stalks were found standing, and some of these were bent over, halfway up their stalks, at right angles. It was also within this formation that the \"pop rocks\" were noted. There were many rocks strewn about, both inside and outside the circles. In and of its'elf, this was not at all unusual to find. What was unusual, though, was the fact that many of these rocks seemed to have \"popped\" out of their previous locations, and had moved just slightly from their original posi- tions. Many of these rocks were at a ground level considerably higher than the flattened grain, once again creating a real challenge for any alleged Directors of Board. The Warner formation is not just notable for its haunting beauty, but for other haunting qualities as well, and these will be detailed later. But first, we should detour from the sublime to the downright bizarre. The crop circle complex discovered on Fred Watmough's farm in Lethbridge is far and away the strangest formation yet discovered. If the British circles are being etched by Extrater- restrial Eschers, this one was fabricated by a visually-impaired dyslexic. Although it is a very elaborate pattern, certainly the most intricate yet reported in North America, it seems to be both random and precise. The overall imagery is vague, and one is left wondering just what it is supposed to be. Gazing at crop circle configurations can be a lot like cloud- watching. Whereas some formations resemble definite objects, or conjure up distinct images, others have interpretations which are far more subjective and personal. No matter what you con- sider agriglyphs to be — a new or obscure symbolic language, an artistic endeavor, or a cosmic Rorschach test — the Wat- mough agriglyph presents a real challenge. In this formation we have an appendange shaped like the letter \"F.\" There is a triangle, nearly isosceles, made of cor- ridors, or lines, which serves no purpose at all except to be a triangle — it connects nothing to anything else. Some of the corridors connect at perfect right angles. One of the smaller circles is formed right on and around a large bare patch of ground, giving the distinct impression of an eye staring up- wards. There is a precision here, yet the overall appearance is haphazard. In media interviews, I have described this for- mation as looking like coins tossed randomly on a tabletop, and then connected with lines — hardly conjuring up the same image as some of the British circles have. Perhaps the best evaluation of the imagery came from our artist, Paul Ander- son. After staring at various photos of this configuration, Paul looked up and said, \"it looks like the Canadian search for an identity.\" I couldn't have said it better. UP STANDING There were many peculiar features in most of the Alberta for- mations. One of the most puzzling discoveries was the Single Stalk Syndrome. This was the appearance in every formation discovered of many single stalks of standing wheat randomly dispersed throughout the circles. In any given circle, anywhere from a dozen or so to scores of isolated single stalks remained standing, while all their neighbors were laid quite flat. This is particularly odd when one considers that a single wheat plant may sprout as many as 20 stalks of grain. Obviously, this ef- fect would be extremely difficult to accomplish with a board, plank, or rope, no matter what you have hanging on your hat. The \"eddy\" effect appeared in several circles, as well. Whereas most British circles with corridors appear as two separate but distinct artifices, in several of the Lethbridge cases, a corridor would enter the periphery of a circle, form the cir- cumference, and then spiral towards the center. Close up, this resembles an eddy in water, but the overall appearance from a distance is scarcely different from the usual. It does, however, indicate the sequences involved in their formation. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Four Brothers\" Quadruplet near Warner, Alberta / Chad Deetken All mechanical equip- ment, e.g., cameras, radio and recording equipment, and vehicles used by in- vestigators and media at the different sites functioned normally, although some ef- fects were reported by others. As have been done in Britain and elsewhere, several tests were carried out using recording equipment. When recording using a microphone, no abnormal sounds were detected. Metal rods were then inserted into the soil at circle sites, with leads hooked up to the microphone input; once again, nothing registered. MY GRAIN HEADACHES Unlike UFOs, which tend to be transient events, crop circles are inclined to stay around for a while. They just sit there in their fields and stare back at those staring at them. Consequently, crop circle reports engender far more than their share of anecdotal evidence, which may eventually take the form of a local mythos. When there are bona fide peripheral effects associated with the formations as well, the dividing line between effect and rumor may become hazy. Since we do not know what is causing crop circles, all the data must be placed in the record. Any reported effect, no matter how strange, may eventually provide a clue to the true nature of the phenomenon. However, we should be cautious as to how much weight is given a particular effect. Although cerealogy is still a fledgling science, the types and number of peripheral effects associated with crop circle events are growing. Perhaps it is time to initiate a variation of Hynek's Strangeness and Probability Index for crop circle reports. One effect that would rate high on such a scale would be the widespread reports of headaches which were attributed to the circles. In nearly every instance in the Alberta series, peo- ple reported developing headaches, often quite severe ones, after having entered or even having been near a crop circle. There were also reports of dizziness, nausea, general malaise, or simply a feeling of uneasiness when in proximity of a circle. While some of these instances could be attributed to a variety of mun- dane causes, e.g., excitement, anxiety, and the like, this symp- tom was too pervasive to not have at least some basis in reality. Another feature which was repeatedly mentioned was the strange behavior of animals, and especially the excessive, unusual, or uncharacteristic barking of dogs prior to the discovery of a formation. This was not just common knowledge in the area, but was mentioned quite specifically by some. For instance. Jenny Skinner's dog howled a great deal the night before her formation was discovered, as did most of the dogs in that area. Fred Watmough, owner of the most elaborate formation to be found, reported that his dog \"went crazy all night long.\" Roy Tetzlaf, whose field gave birth to quadruplets, is the owner of two very quiet and very friendly Malamutes. Many Malamutes, depending on their genetic makeup, are prac- tically incapable of barking, and this was certainly the case with Mr. Tetzlafs dogs. Still, they became very agitated, noisy, and were yowling the day before crop circles were found. One particularly interesting animal effect which was noted might provide a good basis for further investigation, and perhaps yield a clue as to what type or types of energy are associated with crop circles. This effect was studied in detail by Chad Deetken while he was measuring the complex Wat- mough formation. A large flock of Canada geese were feeding in a field ap- proximately 1 km from the formation. On several occasions, various sized groups would leave the flock and head off for a destination in line with the crop circle formation. Every single time a group approached the site, they would detour — veer off to one side or the other — and then continue on their original course. Sometimes a group would split up, some geese flying off to one side and some to the other, only to reform the group after effectively clearing the formation. Not once did any goose fly directly over the configuration. At least 100 birds took part in this ritual, flying at an altitude of 30 to 50 feet. So as to influence the birds' flight as little as possible. Chad was extremely careful to crouch down and remain still long before any geese got near the formation. After the birds had passed the site, they flew over people and moving vehicles MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"with no indication of fear or unusual caution. GENERALLY ELECTRIC Although there were no reports of mechanical failures associated with these reports, there were many instances of electrical failures and anomalies. Mostly, these were reported within three km of the Warner quadruplets, and the most com- mon problems were related to microwave ovens. At least three microwave ovens were reported to have malfunctioned, and in a variety of ways. Roy Tetzlaf s microwave blew out an in- ternal fuse, and another oven, which had been turned off, allegedly somehow turned itself on. By the time this was discovered, a plastic plate on top of the oven had warped from the heat. In addition, automobile radar detectors in the area were said to have gone off when the units were not turned on and when the cars' engines were not running. Perhaps the effect most familiar to ufologists is the radio- telephone incident reported by Roy Tetzlaf in Warner. After discovering the quadruplet formation, Mr. Tetzlaf picked up the radiotelephone which he had in his harvester to phone the nearby grain elevator. He was curious to find out if they could see the formation from their vantage point. The line, so to speak, was completely dead; no noise, no static, nothing. He decided to return to the farmhouse and use the telephone there. When he arrrived, on an impulse, he tried the radiotelephone once more, and ... it worked. He immediately went back out to the circle site, and when he tried the 'phone again, it was once again doing its best impression of a doorknob. Nothing. Back to the house one more time, and, yes, it worked just fine. All very strange incidents, to be sure, but there were things happening that were far stranger. INTO THE MYSTIC Effects were reported in crop circle areas which can only be described as paranormal or poltergeistic in nature. While one of these incidents could well be attributed to a sound associated with crop circle formation, the other is just plain spooky. Jenny Skinner and her daughter-in-law both reported hear- ing, the night before their circle formation was discovered, an extremely strange noise. This was heard around the time the neighborhood dogs were making a commotion. The sound was quite loud and distinct, and seemed to be coming from above the house, at rooftop level. This sound was described as like \"a huge, gigantic bird, flapping its wings.\" It was also described as \"a loud, swishing\" sound, so loud that it woke the daughter- in-law from a sound sleep. Both Ms. Skinner and her daughter- in-law believe that they heard the same sound, or a similar one, several nights earlier. Since it is not known exactly when the circles were made, it seems possible that this sound may actually have been the crop circle formation mechanism at work. An unusually bright light was seen on the horizon around this time, and a neighbor was so upset by all these events, she refused to discuss them with anyone. 3 While recreating an experiment conducted last year at a circle site in the Province of Saskatchewan, the strangest phenomenon of all was encountered. Late at night, sometime past midnight, Chad and two companions entered the Wat- mough configuration, and each laid down in a different sec- tion of the complex. It was a brisk but pleasant night, and stargazing and searching for the aurora borealis was a con- venient excuse for doing this, but the actual purpose was to see what, if anything, might be seen, heard, or experienced that was out of the ordinary. All three people reclining in the formation experienced something unusual at exactly the same time, only this was not known until some time later. After spending some time lying in the formation, Chad began experiencing a tension in his muscles which increased until breathing became difficult. This tension was so acute that he was forced to sit up, and on do- ing so, became quite dizzy. As he was sitting up, he noticed that one of his companions, quite a distance away, was shin- ing a flashlight around the area, as if looking for something. Later, Chad questioned the two separately as to what, if anything, they had experienced while in the formation. Both people told him, independently, that whenever they closed their eyes, they clearly and distinctly heard the sound of footsteps. It was the sound of someone walking on the dry flattened wheat stalks in the pathways, and it seemed to be very close. When asked why he had been shining the flashlight around, the one person said he was afraid someone-or something-was going to step on him. The next day, on a return visit to the Warner formation, Chad casually asked Roy Tetzlaf if he had ever been out in the circles at night. Roy said that he had, and when pressed for details, he related a similar story of hearing the distinct sound of footsteps nearby. In total, there were three identical experiences, from two different locations, and each was reported in- dependently of the others. ZEITGEIST Crop circles are strange. They are not quite like anything else. They appear suddenly and mysteriously, and are audacious enough to stay right where they are. They are taunting and puzzling. People don't \"believe in\" crop circles, crop circles simply are. People are affected by them. Since people are pretty much the same everywhere, and crop circles are now making appearances in more places, how did the inhabitants of this microcosm of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada react when they were suddenly assaulted by this phenomenon? What did they think, what did they feel? What was their explanation for the unknown? The consensus of opinion was that the most likely culprit was UFOs, for obvious reasons. People had been seeing unex- plained lights in the sky. The circles looked as though they had been created by something from above. Conventional ex- planations just didn't fit. There were no vortex hunters in the area, so the idea of some wonderful new meteorological invention didn't occur to anyone — besides, the weather had been fairly typical for the season. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"It was harvest time and many farmers were working from daybreak till well after midnight, so people were probably just too exhausted to go out and destroy their own crops (and thus their livelihood), even though it would have been one heck of a good joke. The whole community was alive, puzzling over the strange events in the fields. When investigators of various stripes ar- rived, they were as puzzled as everyone else, although some at least were familiar with the puzzle. People wanted a definite answer, and when none was forthcoming, they settled for what seemed the most reasonable and rational explanation under the circumstances: UFOs. INADMISSABLE EVIDENCE Obviously, UFOs as an explanation for anything is not going to play well in Peoria, Lethbridge, or anywhere else if you're among a certain segment of the audience. Some folks just won't tolerate that possibility. There has to be a better answer, something more ... convenient. All of a sudden, there was such an answer. Those annoying circles really were hoaxes after all, even though thus far no one at all had come forward to claim responsibility for them. The Alberta Skeptics knew the circles were hoaxes, because they themselves had created the circles! Of course, this skep- tical contingent was rather vague as to particulars, i.e., which ones, when, etc., and their technique left a lot to be desired as well. But for some, it was sufficient. There was one other explanation offered, which should be mentioned for its sociological interest. The working title for this article was \"Fear and Swathing in Alberta,\" based on an incident which occurred in the area and caused a bit of unpleasantness. Amid all the excitment, interest, and sense of wonder brought on by the appearance of the Lethbridge circles, and even though some people were somewhat frightened by what they had seen, no one really reacted in a negative way. However, at least one individual, with a certain vested interest, had to propose a slightly more sinister, perhaps even subterranean, explanation. A Fundamentalist preacher, new to the Lethbridge area, and who evidently felt that any silver lining must obviously have a cloud attached, claimed that the crop circles were the work of the Devil Himself. When this Revelation got a less-than- enthusiastic reception among the adult population, the preacher began terrorizing small children with his theory. Whether this person is still ministering to his flock there is unknown. TESTING ... As always in crop circles cases, laboratory tests are de rigueur. Some have been completed, and others are still being done. Not surprisingly, results thus far are either inconclusive or negative. Some of the tests arranged by UFO*BC include the usual checks for fungi, herbicides, and petrochemicals, etc., as well as a population count of our friends the nematodes. 4 These basic tests have produced nothing of particular interest. However, a more sophisticated battery of tests, including various tests for radiation, is being done at a facility in eastern Canada, and we are awaiting those results. Samples have also been sent to Dr. Leavengood for his unique analysis. Things are now quiet on our western front. No new circles have been reported since that hectic week in September. So, what did it all mean? There are a few observations we can make on this situation. Although England remains the Crop Circle Capitol of the World, and will likely remain so, Canada is certainly holding its own in this area. The situation here has evolved far more rapidly than it did in England. For years. while the world was watching the English countryside, we were receiving virtually no crop circle reports at all. Then sudden- ly, in a mere two years, however, we are only slightly behind in the complexity of our formations. The UFO connection, in the form of lights in the sky (LITS), is becoming stronger. The peripheral effects reported, at least this year, appear to be becoming a standard feature. The Cana- dian configurations, although similar to others elsewhere, have a personality all their own. Consider the crop circles worldwide. Are crop circle for- mations, and the Canadian ones in particular, reflective of not only the country's unique agriculture but of its unique culture as well? Perhaps. Or perhaps not. Only time, or a breakthrough, will tell. The best thing to do would be to stay tuned next year. Same time, same country. NOTES 1. UGM, or Unidentified Ground Marking, is a naming convention de- vised by the North American Institute for Crop Circle Research (NAICCR). This includes all types of unidentified ground markings, bum marks, etc. 2. This feature figures prominently in one other report from the area. A circle was allegedly discovered near the Warner area, in afield of mustard, several weeks prior to these events. The mustard was said to be bent over at a height of two feet from the ground, and quickly righted itself. 3. This is similar to the case of an elderly woman who, according to the local media, had seen a similar bright light in the sky at a reasonably close range, and was so terrified by it that she subsequently refused to speak with anyone about the incident. 4. For those who tuned in late, nematodes are microscopic worms found in all soils. Michael J. Strainic is both the Provincial Director for British Columbia and Canadian Regional Director on the MUFON Board of Directors.

Who thinks they know how to walk?\" I automatically raised my hand and thought, \"Everyone in this rooms knows how to walk; what does this have to do with being a better businessman?\" One person was quickly chosen and brought to the front center row. \"Now, would everyone sitting in an aisle seat down the center here, lay something down on the floor. Paper, pencil, anything.\" The floor down the center aisle began to fill with contributions at the instructor's request. \"OK, I would like you to walk down the center aisle as fast as you can safely go without stepping on anything.\" The volunteer carefully started to the back of the room. His eyes darted about, surveying the path, as his arms bobbed up and down to maintain balance. He looked like a sea-bird step- ping from rock to rock as everyone laughed. \"I need another volunteer.\" As the instructor positioned a young woman with her back to the center aisle he produced a blindfold and tied it securely over her eyes. Turning her around to face down the aisle he said, \"The rules are the same; walk to the back of the room without stepping on anything and take as much time as you need.\" \"I can't! I can't see!\" she said. \"Have you seen blind people walking down the sidewalk?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Then use your feet to feel your way like a blind person uses their cane,\" he said. The woman reluctantly started her way down the aisle. She stumbled a few times, stepped on a few things along the way and took ten times as long as the first volunteer to reach the back. The instructor pointed out that even a person who can only perceive what is directly under their feet can get to the end of their journey. However, it will most certainly take them longer and they will miss many details along the way. On the other hand, the person with the insight and foresight to look all around will ultimately finish the journey faster and with more awareness of the things they encountered. The walk of a scientist is often a strange and wonderful trip. As one learns to walk in science, he/she is required to always keep one foot planted firmly on solid ground while reaching out to test new ground with the other. Only after the new ground is thoroughly and convincingly tested may the scientist shift his/her weight forward, much like the blinded volunteer probing her way down the aisle. It's funny how scientists are expected to discover and under- stand the universe around them, yet they are generally not allowed the creativity to develop their own insight. The real inventors, researchers and discoverers are those who can see the path ahead with all of its gifts and pitfalls. The Einsteins, Salks, Faradays, Teslas, Pasteurs, Edisons, Galileos and da Vincis are the world changers. U fology, a science in its infancy, is affected by lack of insight and foresight possibly worst of all. If asked to compare it to other sciences it would be con- sidered more like archaeology than a pure science such as physics or chemistry. This is due largely to the fact that we are always investigating events that have already happened. At best a UFO investigator will arrive on the scene within hours of the alleged occurrence. Very rarely will the in- vestigator be present for the UFO event itself. If they are, they will rarely admit to it for fear of losing their reputation. Why has Ufology ended up this way? Is it because we spend too much time arguing among ourselves over trivial things? Mr. X: \"There were five dead aliens at the Roswell crash!\" Mr. Y: \"No, you are wrong; there were four dead and one alive.\" Mr. X: \"You are wrong and I'm right.\" Mr. Y: \"Oh, yeah! Who says?\" Has a want or need for money and attention hindered our growth? These things have certainly contributed their share to ufology's current state of affairs, but there are several other major problems faced by our science: 1) The evidence seems to tell us that we are dealing with a phenomenon that is controlled by something more intelligent than we are. Imagine a chimpanzee lumbering out onto a run- way with a club in hand trying to figure out a fighter jet. Could that chimp even carry on a simple conversation with the pilot and would the pilot care? 2) A more serious problem is the lack of conclusive, or even substantial, evidence. The only conclusive evidence would be a whole or crashed craft, or an alien live, dead or in part. All other forms of evidence, landing traces, photographs, scars, testimony and even most artifacts are only circumstantial. Our evidence must prove beyond a shadow of doubt strangeness exceeding all known human technology. This is an extremely tall order. There is another less scientific form of evidence that I feel warrants including; I call it \"Personal Evidence.\" Personal Forest Crawford is MUFON's Assistant State Director for Illinois. As moderator of the Chicago Symposium, Mr. Crawford delivered the following paper; well received, it is reprinted here for the benefit of our members and readers. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Over the next eight months, in excess of 400 UFOs were reported by thirteen indepen- dent witnesses, including many instances of \"Angel Hair.\" evidence is sychronicity, for example, coincidences that may not make sense or hold significance for anyone but the ex- periencer. Personal evidence is usually hard to prove, a hunch or a premonition perhaps. It seems to be a part of our creative, intuitive selves of which we are generally unaware. I would like to share a few examples. Late one night after a long interview with an abductee, I was driving home in a thick fog. The witness and I had just been discussing that she thought the aliens were around and paying attention to more people than we realized. I had the radio on and the disk jockey was playing a series of clips of famous quotes from movies. I craned my neck to look up and out the front win- dow into the fog. Thinking out loud I said to the mist, \"It is too easy for you to hide in the fog. If you are really up there paying attention, it would be nice if you let us know once in a while.\" At the very instant I finished saying that a quote from a \"Three Stooges\" movie played and it said, \"Look, Moe, there is a flying saucer up there!\" A nother incident happened after an interview with a contactee. He had just been telling me that more UFO activity was going to happen and that more and more races of beings would be paying attention to Earth. On the way home I stopped at a quick-stop shop to call home and tell me wife I was running late. I pulled my van up next to the pay phone and turned to get out. There on the wall out- side the quick shop was a Camel cigarette poster. The poster was a picture of a well dressed camel standing against a night sky. A beam of blue and red light from a silver flying saucer shined on him from above. \"THEY'RE COMING,\" in big letters, was all it said. It is nice to know that they may have a sense of humor. Of course there is no proof that this means anything, but I got a kick out of it anyway. Perhaps you had to be there. There is another very important aspect that has held Ufology back: ignoring evidence. If a pharmaceutical company wanted to sell a new drug to the public they would have to thoroughly analyze it to determine its contents and side-effects. If upon analysis they found a compound that they could not identify, would they be able to sell the product? Of course not. They could not take the risk of people becoming ill or dying from something the company could not explain. The truth is, no scientist worth his weight in salt can ignore data and be con- sidered a real scientist. If scientists in other fields cannot ig- nore data, then how can we get away with it? In fact, we have not gotten away with it, but we keep trying to. Remember there was a time when we ignored crash retrievals because they were deemed too controversial. Now there is a crash reported on \"Unsolved Mysteries\" several times a year. Ufologists did the same thing with the abduction phenomenon at one point, yet it has become our main focus of attention lately. We are still doing it with mental transmis- sion and contactee cases. This may be a mistake we will regret later. If small gray aliens wake you in the middle of the night, paralyze you with their stare, beam you through the wall on- board their ship, examine you in a rather unfriendly way, maybe even reproduce hybrid children with you, blank or mask your memory and then return you to bed, that is ac- ceptable. But, if they just want to teach you things, answer questions or help you develop personally, then that is just too hard to believe, and God forbid if they should look too human. If this comparison sounds ludicrous, it is. We must keep an open mind, however, unless we really like eating crow. Let's start our journey along the road of \"Informational Correlations\" in the small Illinois farm town of Bernedotte. On October 4, 1989 in the mid-afternoon, a MUFON field investigator named Poe Clark observed a strange object in the sky. It did not match anything he was familiar with; in other words, it was a UFO. He promptly called Paul Russell, a State Section Director for Illinois MUFON. Paul immediate- ly came down from the Peoria area. Through binoculars Paul and Poe observed a number of strange objects until several hours after dark. The scope of this article is not to comprehen- sively report on the Bernedotte case, but approximately 100 unknown objects were observed that night. Over the next eight months, in excess of 410 UFOs were reported by 13 independent witnesses. Another phenomenon that occurred in conjunction with several sightings was the fall of \"Angel Hair.\" Samples were collected by the in- vestigators, in some cases as it fell from the sky. The samples were put in airtight containers, kept in the dark and frozen to preserve them. The samples remain well preserved even today. Lab analysis on a mass and a FTIR spectrophotometer placed the substance in a family of compounds known as amide-esters. The most popular explanation for angel hair has been balloon spider webs, so a comparative analysis of some spider webs was also conducted. The FTIR spectrograph of the two showed remarkable similarities. Both substances were most certainly in the same family, amide-esters. Ask the Aliens Another interesting thing was coming to light about the same time as the angel hair work. Several abductee cases from around the country were claiming to be receiving informa- tion from their abductors during or between encounters. John Carpenter (State Section Director of Missouri MUFON), Tom Stults (State Director of Illinois MUFON) and myself decided that if the aliens really are talking then this could be impor- tant and we should be able to ask them test questions. If the answers correlated then maybe this would substantiate some validity for these communications. The research philosophy of \"Ask the Aliens\" was born. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"We have been observing the phenomenon ourselves and ask- ing the government for answers for some time. We spend a great deal of time and money sifting through what the govern- ment tells us, trying to find the truth. So, why not get the answers direct from the aliens? Even if they are not telling the whole truth, at least the information is not third or fourth- person removed. Carpenter compiled a list of questions with contributions from other researchers and included questions already asked by the abductees. The list included basic informational questions covering many different topics, some technical, some for control and some totally fabricated. One of the earliest questions asked was, \"What is angel hair?\" Note - Cases named in the following informational correla- tions are all thoroughly investigated or the investigation is ongoing. Some of the cases named are controversial, but none were included unless a reasonable amount of credibility was apparent. A complete description of each of these cases may violate the witnesses' request for anonymity and go beyond the scope of this paper. The answers from four independent cases are as follows: What is Angel Hair? Pat: \"The energy from our propulsion system reacts with organic matter in the air.\" Four Ladies: \"It is excreted through our jets ... because of toxins in your air ... more toxins, more angel hair.\" Jean: \"Angel hair is the sloughing off of a protective emul- sion emitted by our crafts' external systems device. It is con- stantly generated to protect against contaminants. When it has reached maximum absorption levels, it is discarded. It is pro- tection from the many pollutants in your atmosphere. It also serves as an outer lubricant to relieve external stress caused by atmospheric friction.\" John Phillips: \"Some aliens manufacture or clone a worker creature to do menial labor. The creatures do not have a soul but have limited intelligence and can be taught simple tasks. When they have outlived their usefulness they are dissolved and the waste product excreted to the outside of the craft. The substance reacts with the energy of the propulsion system and forms the angel hair.\" I asked what kind of worker creature? \"Insect!\" he answered. The answer by John Phillips was the most outrageous, but let's pause for a moment and compare it to the scientific analysis. The way to make an amide-ester is to mix a pro- teinatious material with formic acid and apply heat. A pro- teinatious material can be made of any material previously living, preferably animal or insect. Formic acid is found in nature in insects (\"Forma\" means ant in Latin). If you dis- solved an insect life-form in an acid and injected this into a high energy electromagnetic field, one would have all the components to effectively make amide-esters. This is essen- tially how a spider makes webs, minus the electromagnetic field, of course. Now let us continue with more questions that the abductees asked of their contacts. They are grouped into several dif- ferent categories according to subject. Technical What is the Mtf (Messier Number) of your galaxy? Jean: \"M13, M31, M14.1 felt that M13 was where they are from and M31 and M14 is where the colonies are.\" Lynn: \"I did not get a number but they told me that it is where our solar system is heading toward and will someday end up.\" A reference to M13 can be found in an encyclopedia, The World of Science, Volume 9, Astronomy n, Exploring the Universe, by Creative World Publications, Inc. In part it says, \"Hercules ... contains an enormous globular cluster known as M13. M13 contains more stars than any other cluster in the Northern Hemisphere. Another curiosity is the star designated Pi (which is right next to M13). It is toward this star that the sun is moving, carrying its system of planets with it. After some millions of years the sun, the Earth and the other planets will be among the stars shining in that corner of the sky.\" A friend of Lynn's told her once that she thought they knew each other in a previous life and that Lynn was called Arkmedia. Lynn stated that when she heard this name it was not her name but the name of the place they were from. (In a communication that Jean had one time, the aliens referred to the \"Suns of Arkmedia.\") The following is a list of a few individual stars that have been named at one time or another as the \"home\" of alien ETs. Betty and Barney Hill: Zeta Reticula 1 & 2 (per the Fish star map) Pat: Zeta Reticulum Oscar: Tau Ceti & Epsilon Eridoni Jill: Tau Ceti (Description matches Oscar's) John Phillips: Vega Four Ladies: Sirius Some Messier numbers reported are M13, M14, M31, M23, M92 and M45. With the exception of M31, which is the An- dromeda galaxy, all the others are open or globular clusters. Most of the specific stars named are double or triple stars. Bob Lazar commented that he thought that the extra heavy elements used in some craft for propulsion could only be form- ed naturally in systems with more than one star in close pro- ximity. This would facilitate enough energy to cause the for- mation of such extra-heavy elements. How do you use light? Debbie Tomey: \"Light, in its many forms, can be used in many different ways: nutrition, healing tissue, travel, disassemble molecules/pass through light/reassemble, light as a means of self-propulsion.\" Jean: \"We travel by means of light fusion. We are able to travel great distances using this power. It is a transformation MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"\"The lesser developed gray aliens must use implants in their subjects and themselves in order to communicate telepathically.\" of light energy to light fuel. It is efficient and powerful. We have harnessed this energy and magnified it to transport us in our travels through the universe. You were brought on- board our craft by means of spectral transport. Your essence was blended with the light beam. It is one method of matter transference. The light particles penetrate your atomic struc- ture which is recorded into the transposer memory. Matter is then reconstructed at the desired site of appearance. Light penetration of matter causes matter to become light which can be controlled and directed to the chosen area of reintegra- tion.\" Lynn: \"Material substances, like chemicals and medicines, can be blended with light. These substances can then be in- corporated into the body by projecting the light through the material structure of the subject. Light also serves as fuel for travel and the generation of energy.\" I amsreminded of how Ed Walters, of the Gulf Breeze, Florida case, described how the beam of light numbed only the part that it touched. Debbie Tomey recalled that it felt as if the light was shining through her body. What is the purpose of implants? Debbie Tomey: \"Tracking, monitoring of individual and sensory receptors, and occasionally altering the energy level of the individual to facilitate necessary communications and molecular changes for the greater good, through adjustment of energy levels.\" Jean: \"The sensory implants have many uses. They are tracking devices. They record sensory input from the sub- jects. They register pollution levels in the subject. They measure stress levels. We are able to study migrational habits of your people. It enables us to communicate with our test- subjects, even from great distances. It is a constant surveillance of our chosen ones. The implants are also warning devices capable of alerting us to certain dangers threatening the in- dividual. It lessens the possibility of premature death of the chosen. They cannot be completely protected but it minimizes our loss.\"  \"\" John Phillips: \"The lesser developed gray aliens must use implants in their subjects and themselves in order to com- municate telepathically. Some do not have natural telepathic ability.\" Lynn: \"The metallic ball implants are only used by the least developed beings and our government. The more advanced the race the harder the technology is to detect. Plastic, gristle- like and gel implants are used by the more advanced beings. The gristle-like and gel implants are also the most difficult to deactivate. Physiological What about cows? Why not use dogs or people? Lynn: \"Cows are less valuable to people.\" Debbie Tomey: \"Cattle tissue is genetically equivalent to human tissue. For our purpose, it is close enough a match that it is generally unnecessary to use humans, or other high level species. We regret the occasional loss of a higher form of life due to the needs of the greater good. We feel the loss, also. Know this, all unfolds as it must. The losses were not in vain.\" Jean: \"We use the tissue from cows in an essential biochemical process necessary for our survival. The material we use from cattle contains the correct amount of protein substances needed for biochemical absorption. While we could use dogs or people for the process, it is morally unac- ceptable. There is little emotional attachment to cows. Cat- tle are not an endangered species. Most dogs are semi- intelligent, loving creatures who provide much comfort in an emotional way. While we respect all life, some sacrifices must be made for the preservation of other species. In most in- stances, your people do not grieve over dead cows as they do dogs or people.\" How do you reproduce? Lynn: \"Very few gray aliens can reproduce the way humans do. Very few have sexual organs but there is a race or two. They are part human, that is how they acquired this ability. Others are like a queen bee. Very, very few females. Jean: \"Our primary reason for contacting your people is reproductive purposes. We need you to propagate our species. For thousands of years we were isolated from life forms with similarity to our own. We have inbred to a level of sterility. We were a dying species until we encountered your planet with abundant variety of life. We discovered our two species were compatible for breeding. There are only a small number of our race capable of reproduction. Most of the cross-children are developed in artificial wombs. This is necessary to pro- duce the quantity of young we must have to survive. Some of our females carry the young to term. This cannot be done in excess. Over-production damages the females' reproduc- tive capabilities. We mate in the same way as you. It is a pleasurable time; however, we do not have your emotional involvement in the act.\" How do you eat and/or drink? Oscar: \"The ones you refer to as 'grays' are more like plant life, like an advanced mushroom, and absorb their food through their skin.\" Stevie Jones: \"I saw the small gray aliens dipping their arms in vats to absorb nutrients.\" Debbie Tomey: \"Absorption through the outer covering of the body, skin, through the soft tissue inside the mouth. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Energy ray, nutritional fluids. Waste excreted through the skin. We do not drink as you understand drink. Do not 'swallow'; fluid is absorbed through tissues in 'mouth'.\" Jean: \"Our method of consumption is very different from your own. We absorb what we need from our environment (and yours). It is similar to photosynthesis. We need light, mineral substances not existing on your planet, proteins and moisture.\" Sociological How many species or races visit Earth? Are their goals different? Debbie Tomey: \"Nine so far.\" Jean: \"There are several types of races visiting Earth at this time. Many others have observed or made temporary studies here. Most of these have been gentle, peace-loving scientists or explorers. There is one breed that visits your peo- ple that should be avoided at all costs. These are the lovers of violence and carnage. They also make contact. They in- fect the morally weak. Most of the mindless killings and cruel- ty on your planet comes from their influence. They are the 'Evil Ones' who thrive on chaos and entertain themselves through the sufferings of others. They are the true demons of your folklore.\" Some singular race correlations have occurred that are worth- presenting. There are currently six cases that have described a human alien as being 5 and 1/2 feet tall, with crew-cut, dark brown hair, brown eyes, 180 to 200 pounds and olive- colored skin. Four of the witnesses correlated the aliens origin as Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridoni. The physical description of the beings was identical in all cases. An attitude of the Tau Cetians is a distinct dislike of some of the grays and the way they are treating abductees. They have given advice to some of their contacts on how to overcome the grays' deceptions. There are also six witnesses who have described with remarkable similarity an insect race or races. The witnesses are divided down the middle as to whether they are good or bad. A race of tall gray beings wearing a hooded or high-collared robe has been regularly reported. They are occasionally re- ported without clothes. They are often referred to as light be- ings even though they appear to have physical form. They are usually described as the elders, a more advanced race or of higher spiritual advancement than the ones they are with. They are usually seen with a different race of beings than their own. Lynn: \"It looked into my eyes and it felt like it was look- ing into my soul, my mind, like it could see every part of my being. When it had completely scanned me with its mind it smiled. Then I felt like I was pulled through its eyes. Like my consciousness went into its eyes. Then I was swimming free in a place with what looked like stars all around. Then we went to a desert where I was taught things.\" Lynn's experience is identical in whole or in part to the Six witnesses, with remarkable similarity, have described a race, or races, of insects. Opinion is divided as to whether they are good or bad. experience of Debbie Tomey, Jean, Rusty and several other well investigated cases. Do you have music, comedy, theater? Jean: \"Our music is the music of light and visual images. Geometric combinations and light patterns are pleasing and soothing to the soul. We can reproduce the music of your world. We have chosen the best examples of various com- positions and have stored them in the data centers. Some of your music is highly irritating. We are bombarded with the noise of your radio waves. We do not understand your enjoy- ment of this raucous auditory pollution. Theater is used for educational purposes, such as the giving of examples for various situations. It is not for entertainment. We have studied your television programming to better understand your peo- ple. This is confusing at times, but we try to average out all data received. We do not have comedy in a theatrical sense. We have humor and amusement. You are an amusing species.\" Debbie Tomey: \"Music is vital; theater, comedy understood. You are our theater, our comedy.\" Debbie add- ed the comment, \"Goody, a smart-ass.\" Stevie Jones: \"As the dark rectangle moved over me I began to get tense. Suddenly, geometric shapes of light in different colors appeared in my mind's eye. It was like music for my mind and it calmed me.\" Predictions Predictions are always dangerous to make because if they do not come true then you look idiotic. Even the witnesses who make predictions will say they are based on the present trends. If anything were to be changed or influenced it could change the trend and therefore the outcome. I will risk the possibility of error and criticism in an effort to report the data as received. The question, \"What can you tell me about the future?\" was asked of 13 totally independent abductees. To summarize the responses: By the end of 1992 there would be so many sightings, landings, abductions, contacts and/or publicity that the UFO question will be resolved in most peoples' minds. Secondarily, natural disasters catastrophic enough to cause social change could occur. Oscar relates that a large asteroid will strike the Earth in the year 2054 if something is not done to prevent it. I am just reporting the data, folks, so take it for what is is worth and, of course, only time will tell. Philosophical How do you relate to the Supreme Being (God)? MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 284 December 1991"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Jean: \"As I have told you before, God is the life essence of the Universe. We relate to this essence through respect for all life. We protect life when it is endangered. This is our goal. Our method of worship is a meditation to our inner selves. We become attuned to the universal life-force.\" Debbie Tomey: \"There is no perfect 'religion,' no perfect people. There is only life. Life, in its purest form, is the begin- ning, the base from which all that exists, originated. Yours and mine, all life, are merely tributaries of the great river. We hold all life in highest esteem, for we are all a part of that life. This is not merely blind faith. We have swum 'The River,' so to speak, and you too shall swim 'The River,' when you are fully prepared. These words that you restrict yourself to make it very difficult to pass on to you the information you seek. 'Religion' is a sociological phenomenon unique to your species. This is created by man. Not to be confused with the spirit. 'God' is the 'Spirit.' Jesus was a man, created by 'God' to help you to understand, on your own level, in your own times and terms. You were obviously not ready at that time. The process will continue until you have reached the level of understanding set for your form of life by the 'God' whom you have come from. Could you possibly understand? You have made your lives, and you have left no room for the 'Spirit' within you. Now is the time to begin to remember that from which you came. Look into yourselves. Look about you. All life that you see, all that is beautiful, all that is ugly, but with soul, all that radiates is life, is the 'Spirit,' is your 'God.' You have been blinded by your lives, you have let your fear, and your negativity keep the inner eye within you closed. Do not fear. 'God' is life eternal. Our greater good is that which works together to bring to the 'Spirit' that which belongs to it, to give it strength and life, for to bring 'It' life, we give life to ourselves, as well. Remember, there is only life if you believe, there is only love if you believe, there is only evil if you believe. If you believe that these things exist for you, then they will, if you believe they do not exist for you, then they will not. You have been given this choice.\" Lynn: \"The Power (God) is the law of the universe. It is that 'Power's' choice to give gifts of awareness and under- standing, like telepathy. God is the 'I Am,' the final law. The All That Is' gives one special capability to all living things, the gift of free will, of choice. You can choose to be com- passionate, you can choose to be destructive, you can choose to do nothing, the choice is yours. Each living thing must take responsibility for its own life. To open what you call the 'Gates of Heaven' you must first understand and know what the original gift is. By giving the gift of free will, the gift of choice, to other living beings you come closer to knowing your oneness with all living things, with your Creator. This is the key to unlock the 'Gates of Heaven' and receive understanding and wisdom from the universe. Always respect the gift of choice given by 'The Power' to all creations, aware or unaware. Trust that each creation will find its creator and its home for it has eternity to do so.\" Very profound for a bunch of little gray genetic engineers. The questions and answers in this article were chosen to supply a variety of responses to some popular topics. As one can imagine, there are many more correlations and others that are still being researched. We started out by determining what and where we are as Ufologists. We examined some of our more serious pitfalls like: • Lack of conclusive evidence. • We may be monkeys studying fighter jets. • We have a nasty habit of ignoring data we are uncom- fortable with. We then started our walk as scientists in the safety of the lab. We followed the data correlations and landed in the etheric world of spiritual philosophy. As UFO scientists we should strive to be a combination of archaeologist, sociologist and futurist. Do not forget to allow your paradigms room to grow. We can then learn from what has happened to better understand what is happening and have the foresight to see what will happen.

I can see it in the pale pinkish glow of the the haze in the eastern sky. A small glob of light. Not very spectacular. I'll grab my binoculars and see what it is. An airplane perhaps? ; My God, it's a ring! Yes, a ring. I can see the points of light. They form a fat ellipse. I count them quickly. I get up to eight, but it is dif- ficult with the binoculars shaking as I hold them. There may be more, perhaps ten or so. But this is impossible. How can it be? Gulf Breeze is such a normal place. Cars, houses, boats, streetlights, shopping centers ... everyday citizens going about their business on a hot, hazy fall evening in this lazy resort town. Everyone and everything looks so commonplace. Nothing really strange could happen here. But for the space of some f 70 seconds on Monday night, September 16, 1991, Gulf Breeze was anything but normal. I came all the way from the Washington, D.C. area to learn more about what is happening here in Florida. Of course I already knew on an intellectual level, having investigated dozens of UFO sightings ... but could I add experience to my theoretical knowledge? I didn't know. What I did know was that a unique social phenomenon has occurred in Gulf Breeze as a result of repeated sightings of unusual lights in the sky since last November. For lack of a better word these lights can be called UFOs - unidentified flying objects. Sometimes UFOs are easily identified and become IFOs. But sometimes they can't be so easily explained and sometimes they are impossible to explain. The impossi- ble ones are the most interesting ... they prove the existence of something that should not be. For the first time anywhere in the world a group of citizens has maintained a nightly watch for nine months, looking for UFOs which should not be. Why, you may ask, would sane people do such a silly thing? After all, aren't UFOs the realm of kooks and nuts? Aren't these the things we read about in the weekly tabloids? (A UFO Saved My Virginity: UFO Alien and Earth Mother have Baby Bigfoot, etc.) If your answer to the last two questions is yes, then prepare for a surprise. The people who are carrying out this nightly watch are members of the MUFON's Gulf Breeze Research Team (GBRT). They are chemists, real estate agents, doc- tors, musicians, business people, etc., people who are en- tirely normal in their everyday activities. However, they do have one unifying characteristic that sets them apart from the general population: they have seen, or know people who have seen, something that should not be. And they want to know more about it ... Their patience has paid off. They have sighted odd lights in the night sky many times since last November. The most recent event (as of this writing) was Sept. 16, and it is the 78th in a series of unexplained sightings. (There were also five sightings which have likely explanations ... IFOs). Their approach to learning more about these odd lights is not that of the UFO cultist or contactee. There are no rituals, no prayers to higher powers, no messages from the space brothers, no guru explaining the occult (which means hidden!) ways of the universe. Instead there are cameras, there are video recorders, there are angle measurements and triangulations, photo analyses, calculations, estimates of size, dynamics, shape, etc. These people are providing the data gathering and analysis effort in order to understand and identify, if possi- ble, these phenomena, these lights, that they have recorded. No one has ever done this on such a continuous basis before (except, perhaps the U.S. government, and it isn't talking). The GBRT has accumulated hours of videotape of sightings and interviews and dozens of photos. These prove that some lighted objects that shouldn't be there have been seen in the skies of Gulf Breeze and occasionally over Pensacola. I published the first comprehensive study of these sightings in the Proceedings of the MUFON 1991 Annual Symposium. This paper, entitled \"Gulf Breeze Without Ed,\" covers about 280 sightings up through March of this year. Further articles will cover more recent sightings. The April sightings provide good examples of the characteristics of some of these unusual lights and the scien- tific analysis being done to try to understand and identify them. At 8:10 p.m. April 9, the GBRT saw a red light in the east from two locations at Shoreline Park. Subsequent triangula- tion indicated that the light was roughly seven to nine miles east of them. Subsequently, three witnesses not formerly known to the GBRT members volunteered the information that they had been at the K-Mart on that night and had seen a large object with a reddish glow and distinct red lights on the bottom. Analysis of their testimony showed that they were looking toward the same object that the GBRT had seen, but the K-Mart witnesses were much closer, perhaps less than three miles away. Based on the testimony and measurements made by the GBRT it was possible to estimate that the red- dish object was large, tens of feet in diameter. During the evening of April 17, a red light appeared and was seen for about one minute and then it turned white within a second after a witness, recorded on videotape, predicted that it would do so. But this object did not just change color. It started flashing in an irregular manner at a high rate of speed, sometimes changing brightness in less than l/30th of a second.

This sort of glare can be produced by a street light at a distance of a several hundred feet or less. But the triangula- tion placed this object at a distance of five miles. After flashing white for about five seconds it ejected a white lighted object which immediately disappeared and then it turned red again and faded out about a minute later. During a sighting on August 7 observations were made from widely separated locations and a triangulation was done. The distance from the GBRT observers, combined with photo- graphic data taken with a calibrated camera, indicate that the object was between 10 and 20 feet in size. More recent sightings have also offered the opportunity of combining photographic and triangulation data to determine object size, but the analyses have not been completed. I arrived at the Pensacola airport Sunday evening and was taken immediately to the Bay Bridge \"sighting area,\" where I observed about two dozen cars and perhaps 50 people with cameras, binoculars, and video recorders just sitting and waiting or in heated conversations with other people over previous sightings. I set up my equipment and proceeded to talk to several of the other people, people whose names are familiar to me from my studies of previous sightings, many of whom I had never met before. Several hours later we left ... empty handed. The disappointment was like a dark cloud hanging over the group. But hope springs eternal from the human breast. On Mon- day night I was there early. It was amazing to see the cars rolling in just after dark. Why aren't these people home watching TV? Why aren't they sailing or swimming or clean- ing their houses or shopping or going to club meetings or watching a football game or going to the movies or doing any of the myriad other things that people can do in the evening? I would find out shortly. After setting up my equipment, which includes a con- tinuously running tape recorder and a special microphone that can pick up sounds from a wide area around it, I started talking to several of the other people about their previous sightings. Then it happened at 8:33 p.m. CDT. I didn't know where to look. No one yelled \"115 degrees azimuth, 35 degrees eleva- tion;\" or anything like that. Since the object had been ap- pearing in the east. I looked eastward, toward the light of Gulf Breeze, and upward into the pinkish haze that nearly com- pletely blocked the stars. I could see a small, blobby pale yellowish ... something. Could that be \"it\" or was it only an airplane? It certainly didn't look impressive, and yet it was in an area of the sky where I had seen nothing before. I didn't have to wait long for my answer. My binoculars had been hanging around my neck all evening. I grabbed them and looked. Man: My God! It's a ring. Another Man: It's a ring. Another Man: Oh, wow, look at that. Woman: It's a ring. Oh, God, yes. Me: (nine seconds into the sightings): Yep. It's got points ... I can see the points of light. (I was seeing tiny, clear lights in an elliptical ring;) (Voices) Man: Hey, somebody sight through that other instrument down there. (Voices, noise) Me: (42 seconds; I'm counting the points of light) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight ... Man: Look at that ring. Is that beautiful? Me: (60 seconds; taking pictures) We're seeing the ring at an angular altitude of about 45 degrees or maybe a little bit less. (Actually I overestimated the angle in my haste.) (The ring fades out.) (71 seconds) Me: I saw it. Woman: Yes! We did it! I'm thinking, what did I see? An elliptical ring of clear, crisp lights ... like pale yellow-white pearls ... that just ap- peared in the sky. It seemed to move toward us slowly, and perhaps upward. The wind was from the west... I was look- ing east.. and it appeared to be moving into the wind. There are no airplanes with circular lights. The only possible ex- planation is an advertising plane that is advertising ... what, pearl necklaces? But there was no noise. I looked very careful- ly at the sky after the object was gone. With the binoculars I could penetrate the haze to the stars ... but there was nothing. Advertising planes don't just disappear. A quick analysis, possibly to be revised as the photo analysis is completed: the angular width, as predicted, was one to two milliradians, with a distance estimated at between two and four thousand feet, giving a size estimate of somewhere be- tween two and eight feet. (Each milliradian corresponds to one foot of width at 1,000 ft. distance, two feet at 2,000 ft. and so on.) Conventional wisdom: It should not have been there! But there it was. I know. I saw it. So did 33 other people with almost that many binoculars, a dozen cameras and several video recorders.

He has been releasing a series of special bulletins via fax throughout the 1991 season. The following bulletin, #14, concerns itself with the allegations of \"Doug & Dave,\" two Britons who claim to have fabricated between 20 and 25 crop circles each and every summer for the past 13 years. Their claims are currently under investigation. T he final circle of the season (so far as we know) appeared on September 12, 1991, in a crop of linseed near the church at Old Alresford, Hampshire. It was a plain circle 38 feet in diameter, swirled clockwise. Alresford is where Pat Delgado lives and where he was confronted and browbeaten by self-proclaimed hoaxers Doug Bower and David Chorley, two English sexagenarians, together with the hacks from Today newspaper on September 8. The Alresford circle, which I'm assured is genuine, in one of the very last uncut fields seemed to be saying \"We're still here ... had you forgotten us!?\" Meanwhile more murky facts are emerging slowly from the \"hoax\" saga. The story was supplied to the Today tab- loid by MBF Services, although the paper stated that it paid no money for the story. When asked how MBF Services could be contacted, Today either dodged the question or gave conflicting replies: 1) \"There is no telephone number for MBF\" (an odd sort of news agency!); 2) They didn't know the address of MBF; 3) the story had been marked \"Copyright MBF Services\" to prevent others publishing copyright material; 4) We could reprint whatever we liked without charge; 5) MBF had an address in Shepton Mallet; 6) A contact number for MBF was 0962-713843 on the Twyford (Winchester) exchange. (I think this last one slip- ped out by mistake.) The Shepton Mallet address is an accommodation address with a firm of chartered accountants who have MBF as a client. Describing it as a \"Scientific Research and Develop- ment Company,\" they would tell us no more about their client. The Twyford number had been discontinued by last week, and enquiries to British Telecom revealed equal confusion. It was described first as a private residential number, and then as a \"special exchange number.\" Solicitors searches have now revealed that the director of MBF is a certain Dr. Andrew Winsloe Clifford of Maiden Beech Farm, West Crewkerne, Somerset. This, of course, solves what MBF stands for, but we still need to find out more about Dr. Clifford. He and his wife are sole shareholders and the company was first registered in April of 1991. No accounts have been returned so far. Meanwhile, we made enquiries of a contact who works in M15. The question posed was \"How does the British Govern- ment go about disinformation exercises?\" No mention was made of the crop circles. We were told that both M15 and M16 each have sections expressly for the purpose of dis- information. Our informant added that we couldn't have chosen a better person to ask, since he had been involved in such exercises in the anti-terrorist campaign in Northern Ireland just a few years back. The method was to set up a bogus freelance news agency (or to disguise some small derelict company as such), and to feed the disinformation to tar- geted newspapers. \"What about a telephone number for the news agency?\" That was always the problem, and us- ually if a number was used it would be a special number in the exchange, or even a Belfast number which was directly connected to a phone in the M15 building in London. It looks as if exactly the same methods are being employed in 1991. On Friday a number of us had a chance to confront Doug and Dave on Granada's \"Upfront\" TV program. After fill- ing in the background to all this, I asked them 1) Who are the MBF news agency and who are the directors? 2) Why does MBF have no telephone number? 3) Have you at any time, or now, worked for the Government Intelligence or Security services? All three questions were denied, evaded or laughed off. The TV show finished in uproar. I doubt if many people will have got the message, but clearly I have not endeared myself to the powerful people who are behind this undoubted scam. Watch this space. There is quite definitely the smell of a great big dirty rat here and there are now two or three in- vestigative journalists working on it. With a general election in the offing, this imbroglio could provide some quite in- teresting \"ammunition\" for the opposition parties.

The most significant development was the award in June of a $1,000 grant to Michael Chorost, a Ph.D. candidate at Duke University, who proposed to visit England during the summer to investigate the \"crop circle\" phenomenon. Im- mediately after learning that the mysterious patterns (called \"agriglyphs\" by some researchers) had begun appearing, the Executive Committee approved Chorost's request. A report is forthcoming. Also during this period, National Board Member Richard Haines, Ph.D., proposed to establish a \"Joint American-Soviet Aerial Anomaly Federation\" to share research findings. The major goal of the organization would be to improve com- munications between the UFO communities in both coun- tries, for example, by establishing a joint library of US/Soviet research. The federation would be composed of UFO organizations in the US and USSR. In the meantime, Fund Chairman Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., was in communication with Vladimir Azhazha, director of the Soyuzufosentr (a coalition of UFO organizations in the Soviet Union), who proposed establishing a UFO cor- respondence course. Dr. Maccabee expressed the Fund's in- terest in discussing greater cooperation between the two organizations. In June, the Executive Committee received a request from nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman to underwrite the costs of a polygraph examination of Gerald Anderson, who says he was present during the discovery of a crashed UFO and alien beings near Magdalena, NM, in July 1947. Mr. Fried- man's request included a proposal to conduct further research into the Roswell case in New Mexico. The Executive Com- mittee had earlier approved a request for $200 to pay for telephone calls associated with Friedman's research into the Roswell case; and it approved a proposal submitted by in- vestigator Don Schmitt to spend up to $1,000 to locate addi- tional firsthand witnesses. The total amount spent or com- mitted by the Fund to date on the Roswell case investigation is approximately $50,000. Speaking of crashed saucers, the Fund also approved the expenditure of more than $300 for expenses related to in- vestigator Leonard Stringfield's continuing research into UFO crash/retrieval cases. Mr. Stringfield was preparing to publish a status report on his research this year. UFO investigator and author Ann Druffel contacted the Ex- ecutive Committee in June with a request for financial assistance in a UFO \"abduction\" case investigation involv- ing a reported \"missing fetus.\" As those acquainted with the abduction phenomenon are aware, there are a number of cases in which female witnesses have reported to investigators that during the course of a series of encounters with apparent alien beings, they became pregnant, only to discover later that they were no longer pregnant with no evidence of a miscarriage having taken place. Mrs. Druffel had been investigating such a case and ar- ranged to interview the witness' physician; she requested a grant of $375 from the Fund to pay the consulting fee nor- mally charged by the doctor. The Executive Committee ap- proved the request under the Fund's \"rapid response\" policy, and Mrs. Druffel was able to schedule the interview. A report on the outcome will be available in the near future. On June 8, the Executive Committee sponsored a meeting to discuss the current status of UFO research, focusing on government involvement in UFOs and the abduction phenomenon. Attendance at the meeting was by invitation on- ly, and those present included professionals in a variety of fields. Prior to the annual symposium of the Mutual UFO Net- work in July, the Executive Committee decided once again to make a $500 cash award in the name of Isabel Davis, one of the founders of the Fund, to the recipient of the MUFON award (who is chosen by members of the organization).

Slayton, of the 133 Fighter Intercep- tor Wing, spotted a strange white object which he first thought might be a kind of kite. Visibility that day was excep- tional, but even then he wasn't sure what it was off to his left and below his F-51 as he dived toward it. As the object grew larger in the windshield, Captain Slayton realized that both his plane and the UFO were above 10,000 feet altitude, an unlikely place for a kite. As he got closer he detected an ability to maneuver and accelerate on the UFO's part. When the distance grew even less, Captain Slayton noticed that \"... the object appeared to be two discs 18 inches to two feet in diameter and approximately one foot apart, spinning at a rapid rate.\" Gain- ing in speed to an estimated 400 MPH, the two spinning discs turned away and evaded further observation. (UFOs: A History, 1951 by Loren E. Gross) Donald K. (Deke) Slayton (Houston, TX) is a former astronaut. 1956 • The following Air Force report was sent to the National In- vestigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena from a Far East Air Force Base: \"Two Air Force jet pilots were practicing ground radar positioned in- tercepts on each other. During one run, the intercepting pilot picked up a strange radar blip from an unknown ob- ject in the sky. From the size of the blip — one-eighth inch high and three- eighths of an inch wide — the UFO was estimated to be as large as a B-29 bomber. The pilot called GCI (Ground Control Intercept) and received permis- sion to determine the nature of the source of the radar return. At eight miles, a round object appeared exactly where radar showed it. (Later calcula- tions indicated it was at least 200 feet in diameter, probably nearer 350.) As the plane came closer, its radar was suddenly jammed by a strong in- terference. Using anti-jam procedures, the pilot switched frequency. For 10 seconds this eliminated the mysterious interference pulses, then they began again. But the pulsations were not strong enough to break the radar lock-on, and the jet held its course. The jet closed to within five nautical miles of the object but could not close further. When the pilot was closest to the UFO it appeared to make a shallow left turn. It had the appearance of being circular on the bot- tom. After the UFO's slight turn, the pilot's radar indicated that the object was* moving up and away at from 1500 to 1800 knots. The blip disappeared by moving rapidly off the top of the scope.\" (UFO Investigator, Aug./Sept. 1957; Sun-Times, Chicago, IL, 10/4/57) 1966 • Four UFOs over Ream Field (Naval Auxiliary Air Station, San Diego, California) were sighted by 14 persons at the main gate at 9:30 p.m. on the 16th. Three Navy pilots and 11 other persons observed the objects maneuvering for nine minutes. Ensign John Schmitt, 22, a helicopter pilot, said he and friends were leaving through the main gate when they first saw the objects. \"There were three ob- jects,\" he said, \"and they appeared to be up about 50,000 feet. They were bright, round yellow objects flying in a triangular formation. They looked to be about the size of a quarter from where we were.\" With Schmitt were Ensigns John Coghill, 23, a pilot at Miramar Naval Air Station, and David Conklin, 22, a North Island Naval Air Station pilot. \"I can't say the objects were UFOs,\" Schmitt said. \"We don't know what they were. But none of us had ever seen anything like them. They would hover, then go forward, then to one side. The three were traveling at speeds from about the maximum speed of a bomber to about five times that speed,\" Schmitt said. \"A fourth one came over the horizon from the east at a terrific speed. It came up to the group of three, stayed near the formation for a minute, then headed to the east. It dropped to a lower altitude and the magnitude of its light increased. It dropped what appeared to be two small spheres of light, which disappeared, then it headed west and we lost sight of it. Then the other three objects suddenly disappeared.\" (The Evening Tribune, San Diego, CA, 12/17/66) • Canadian Pacific Airlines Flight 421, en route from Lima, Peru, to Mex- ico City on the night of the 29th was paced by a strange object which the five-man crew was later unable to ex- plain as anything but a UFO. \"I think it was something other than normal,\" said the pilot, Captain Robert Millbank, a 26ryear veteran. Capt. Millbank was flying the DC-8 northwest along the Peruvian coast at 35,000 feet, with a moon two days past full brightening the clear night sky. At a position south of the Equator two twinkling white lights were observed close together on the horizon, to the left of the nose of the airplane. The lights arced toward the plane, separating as they did so, brightened and descended. Two thin beams of light shining upward in a V- pattern emanated from the lights themselves. At the altitude of the DC-8 the lights levelled off, taking position beyond the left wing. By this time the entire crew was watching the UFO through as many windows as possible to rule out re- flections. The UFO's shape was in- distinct, but it appeared to be thicker in the center. At closer range, a string of yellow lights became visible on the edge of the object, between the two large lights.

The riddle began with a report from Finnish school-boy Eero Lammi, who claimed he had been knocked down by a \"beam of light.\" He was on his way home to Uleaborg, on the Finnish side of the Swedish fron- tier, when he saw a ball of light move across the border from Sweden and ap- pear to land in a nearby field. \"I went to look at it,\" Lammi said, \"but sud- denly a ray of light seemed to beam out from it and I felt a searing pain in my chest and everything went black.\" Even his parents thought it was a prank until a doctor found the boy had slight burns on his chest ... and back. At the Swedish Military High Command, which investigates all reports of UFO sightings, Colonel Bertil Eriksson said: \"We do not know how it happened. We have been unable to trace anybody else in the area who saw anything unusual on that day.\" The second report came from a university student who was out bird- watching near Tiveden, 400 miles south of the border. His description of the ob- ject tallied exactly with the measure- ments given by the Finnish youth. \"It was about five metres in width and looked like a moving ball of light.\" Mr. Sture Wickerts, UFO expert and research chief at the headquarters of the Swedish Defense Intelligence Organiza- tion, said that \"the student's name is not being released at the moment. He is a technical student and was very precise with his description. He was us- ing binoculars and suddenly spotted a 'round object with pulsating lights,' lift into the air. He was able to detect that the object was colored black and grey, and he heard a strong throbbing noise which lasted about 10 seconds. He estimated that the frequency of the noise was about three hertz.\" (Sunday Ex- press, London, England, 12/12/76) Calendar of UFO Conferences for 1992 March 20, 21 & 22 — The 3rd UFO/ET Alien and Abduction Congress - Days Inn, Bordentown, New Jersey.

Use the nearby lunar crescent on the 6th to find Saturn a few degrees to the lower left. Bright Planets: (Morning Sky) Mercury and Mars are visible together very low in the SE at dawn. The brighter Mercury closes to within 0.7° of the red planet on the 10th and llth then disap- pears below the horizon by midmonth. The crescent Moon lies near Mercury on January 2. Don't confuse reddish Antares with either planet; the star is to the upper right of Mercury. Venus rises about 4:30 AM in mid-January, glowing brightly in the SE at dawn. Our brilliant neighbor closes to within 9° of much dimmer Mars by month's end. The lunar crescent appears near Venus on the 1st, 30th and 31st. Jupiter is high in the SW at dawn. Annular Solar Eclipse: On Saturday afternoon, January 4, the new moon near the far point (apogee) of its orbit crosses in front of the Sun, leaving a ring (annulus) of light ex- posed around the dark lunar disc. Though the spectacular phenomena of a total eclipse will be absent, nevertheless the sight of a solar ring setting off the southern California coast is unusual and worth attempting to see. Other than a few Pacific islands, the path of annularity touches land only between NW Baja and Oxnard, GA. From beaches and hills near Los Angeles, the partial phase begins at 3:33 PM followed by the start of the ring phase at 4:50 when 83% of the Sun's disc is obscured. Since the Sun will be near setting, the view to the WSW must be flat, unobstructed and free of haze. The annular phase ends just before the Sun sets below the horizon. To the south at San Diego, the solar disc drops below the horizon while the annular phase is in progress. Varying amounts of a partial eclipse (minus the ring) will be visible before sunset from west of a line through central Texas, eastern Colorado, eastern Wyoming, central Montana, western Canada and central Alaska. Local start- ing times for selected cities: Albuquerque, 4:41 PM; Anchorage 2:17 (6% max- imum obscuration); Denver, 4:38; Fresno, 3:32 (76%); Honolulu, 12:10 (57%); Phoenix, 4:38; Salt Lake City, 4:35; San Francisco, 3:29 (70%); Seattle, 3:27. The same warnings about eye safety given for last July's solar eclipse apply here as well. (See the June 1991 issue.) If the Sun is low enough and dim enough to permit direct viewing with the naked eye, try taking occasional cautious quick peeks at the solar disc, especially to glimpse the beauty of the setting ringed Sun. Moon Phases: New moon — January 4 First quarter — January 12 Full moon — January 19 - Nearest Moon of 1992, producing extra high tides for several days Last quarter — January 26 The Stars: In midevening the brilliant stars of winter fill the SE quadrant of_ the heavens. Orion the Hunter now dominates the southern sky, and with his characteristic hourglass shape and three belt stars in a row is one of the easiest constellations to recognize. Look for the glowing Orion Nebula in the Hunter's sword below the belt. Orion's belt, by the way, serves as a guide to the brightest star of night- time, Sirius (a line traced through the belt to the lower left), and to the Bull's orange eye, Aldebaran (a line to the upper right). Just to the right of Aldebaran is the beautiful little star cluster called the Pleiades or Seven Sisters, frequently mistaken for the Little Dipper. From rural America, the Milky Way can be seen in all its splendor cross- ing the sky directly overhead from NW to SE.

Through his leader- ship and enthusiasm, Delaware has grown to over 40 members in one year.

Future MUFON Symposia Since the annual MUFON UFO sym- posia rotate each year between the dif- ferent regions in North America, it is fitting to elaborate on these factors for future planning. The Eastern Region will host the 1993 event. Central Region in 1994, Western Region in 1995 and back to the Eastern Region in 1996. Considering the problem that we had in 1982 in Toronto, Ontario with mov- ing photo exhibits and proceedings through the \"border brokers\" in Canada, a Canadian regional location has been placed on temporary hold. Cities like Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa and Vancouver would be ideal spots to conduct future symposia, provided there was a strong host group. Several state groups have expressed an interest in hosting a forthcoming symposium. Please submit your written bids to Walt Andrus or your Regional Director. UFOs, MJ-12 and the Government Grant Cameron and T. Scott Grain's new book UFOs, MJ-12 and the Government: A Report on Government Involvement in the UFO Crash Retrievals (113 pages), published by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. is another view of the intrigue and people associated with this controversial issue. This well written and documented book is essential to the library of everyone interested in the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. It may be purchased from MUFON for $19 plus $1.50 for postage and handling.
