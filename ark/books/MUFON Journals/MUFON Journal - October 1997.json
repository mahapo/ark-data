The article, by CIA historian Gerald Haines, is published in the unclassified version of Studies in Intel- ligence, a twice-yearly CIA journal (Volume 1, 1997. pg. 67). The article presents the history of CIA involvement as determined mostly from documents released by the CIA nearly 20 years ago. There is also some updating on CIA activities since the documents were re- leased in December, 1978. According to the CIA documents, in the early days (late 40s early 50s) the CIA got its UFO information from the Air Technical Intelligence Center at the Air Materiel Command headquartered at Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. This was the \"home\" of Projects SIGN, GRUDGE and BLUE BOOK (see below). Consequently the CIA was \"fed\" the con- ventional AF position on the subject (no ev- idence of truly new technology: no evidence of a threat). In the late summer of 1952 the CIA investigated Project Blue Book and concluded that it was satisfactory if all one wanted to do was separate explainable sightings from those which were not ex- plainable. However, the CIA analysts were critical of the Air Force for not studying the unexplained sightings to find out the under- lying causes of the reports. The CIA evalu- ated the whole subject and concluded that there might really be something unusual go- ing on. During the fall of 1952 at least one CIA official, Marshall Chadwick, appar- ently believed that the unexplained sight- ings were a real mystery. However, before According to a CIA historian, over half of all UFO reports from the late 50s through the 60s were attributable to high-flying U-2s. Preposterous, says Bruce Maccabee. October 1997 Number 354 Pages"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The U-2, with its 80-foot wingspan, flew at 60-70,000 feet and at that altitude was essen- tially invisible during the day. It created no contrail be- cause of the lack of mois- ture at that al- titude. October 1997 Number 354 Page 4 carrying out an in-depth study to be autho- rized by the National Security Council, he wanted to have a panel of experts review the situation. This panel, which came to be known as the Robertson Panel after its chairman, carried out its review in early 1953. After this review, which basically adopted the AF official position that every- thing could be explained, the CIA appar- ently lost interest in the subject. All of the above has been known for years. However, the new article reveals some information which was still classified Top Secret in December, 1978 when the FOIA documents were released. According to Mr. Haines 1 ar- ticle, when the U-2 high altitude spy plane began flying (first flight on August 4, 1955), CIA project directors discovered that \"commercial pilots and air traffic con- trollers began reporting a large increase in UFO sightings.\" The U-2 is the high altitude spy plane made famous by the 1960 shootdown of Gary Powers as he flew over the Soviet Union and by photos taken from a U-2 of Russian missile sites in Cuba during the \"Cuban Missile Crisis.\" M r. Haines has written, \"According to later estimates from CIA officials who worked on the U-2 project and the OX- CART (SR-71 or Blackbird) project, over half of all UFO reports from the late 1950s through the 1960s were accounted for by manned reconnaissance flights (namely the U-2) over the United States. This led the Air Force to make misleading and deceptive statements to the public in order to allay public fears and to protect an extraordinar- ily sensitive national security project. While perhaps justified, this deception added fuel to the later conspiracy theories and the coverup controversy of the 1970s. The per- centage of what the Air Force considered unexplained UFO sightings fell to 5.9 per- cent in 1955 and to 4 percent in 1956.\" This explanation for many (\"over half of all\") UFO reports has never before been publicized. It was not contained within doc- uments released by the CIA in December, 1978 after a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FOIA) by Ground Saucer Watch, a civilian UFO orga- nization which ended its activities in the early 1980s. According to Mr. Haines the U-2 was re- ported as a UFO because \"the early U-2's were silver (they were later painted black) and reflected the rays of the sun, especially at sunrise and sunset. They often appeared as fiery objects to observers below. Air Force BLUE BOOK investigators, aware of the secret U-2 flights, tried to explain away such sightings by linking them to natural phenomena such as ice crystals and temper- ature inversions. By checking with the Agency's U-2 Project Staff in Washington, BLUE BOOK investigators were able to at- tribute many UFO sightings to U-2 flights. They were careful, however, not to reveal the true cause of the sighting to the public.\" Project BLUE BOOK was the publicly known Air Force effort to collect and ex- plain, if possible, UFO sightings. Any sight- ings which they could not explain were cat- egorized as unknown. No careful analyses of the unknowns were carried out. Project BLUE BOOK ran from early 1951 through 1969, When it closed, BLUE BOOK and its predecessors (Project SIGN, 1948,'and Project GRUDGE, 1949-1951) had col- lected about 13,000 sightings, of which about 700 were left unexplained. The claim that the U-2 caused \"over half of all UFO reports from the late 1950s through the 1960s\" is, to put it gently, pre- posterous. The U-2, with its 80 ft long by 6 ft wide (front to back) wingspan, flew at 60- 70,000 feet and at that altitude was essen- tially invisible during the day. It created no contrai I because of the lack of moisture at that altitude. It was, after all, designed to at- tract little attention from the ground as it flew at a higher altitude than could be at- tained by any Russian defense missiles! Nevertheless, during the hour before sunrise and the hour following sunset it would be possible for an unpainted aircraft to reflect the sun enough to be visible, perhaps with a reddish glow resulting from the reddening of sunlight (caused by passage of the sun- light through the atmosphere, which acts like a filter that removes blue and green rel- ative to red). High altitude balloons (e.g., Project SKYHOOK) did cause some UFO reports during these times of day and were so identified by the Air Force and civilian investigators. However, only a small frac- tion of sightings occur durnu: ihe^e times. The largest fraction of sighting i^ at night, when the U-2 can't be seen and ihe next largest fraction is during the dd>lniie. A check of the Project BLUE BOOK sighting statistics in the \"Condon Report\" (Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects, D.S. Gilmor, Ed., Air Force publi-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL cation, 1968; Bantam edition, 1969, pg. 514), which includes sightings by pilots and air traffic controllers as well as by military personnel and civilians ^hows the follow- ing numbers of sighiniL's tor the six months before to the six months .itier flights began in early August: Feb - 34, Mar-41, Apr - 33, May - 54, Jun - 48, Jul - 63, Aug - 68, Sep - 57, Oct - 55, Nov - 32, Dec - 25, Jan (1956) - 43. Notice that the August increase of 5 reports over the number in July may have been just a continuation of the overall increase that began in April, 1955. Then the number of reports per month dropped even though the number of U-2 flights increased. The total number of reports during the 6 months before the start of U-2 flights is 273. The total number for the 6 months follow- ing the start (Aug - Jan) is 280. Thus, there was a 100 x (7/273) = 2.6% increase in the number of reports following the start of U-2 flights using the six month totals. These numbers are the sum of ex- plained and unexplained sightings and so include U-2 sightings, if any. These statis- tics Miygcsi that the U-2 was causing no more ih.m .1 few percent of the sightings (and may have caused NONE of the sight- ings!). Comparing yearly statistics in the Condon Report we find: 1953 - 509, 1954 - 487, 1955 - 545. Tn 1956 there was an in- crease during the summer months with 72 in July, 123 in August and 71 in September which, when added to the nominal rate for the other months (40 to 50 per month) re- sulted in a total of 670 for the year. The year 1957 had 1005 reports, mostly as a re- sult of the \"Sputnik Flap\" (103 in October, 361 in November and 136 in December; other months were in the range of 40 - 70 reports). Although the number of U-2 air- craft and the number of flights increased during the following years the number of sightings showed no correlation: 1958 - 627, 1959-390, 1960-557, 1961 -591, 1962-474, etc. Statistics based on a different set of data are contained within the \"U Database\" of over 14^000 sightings by Larry Hatch (Larry Hatch Software, 142 Jeter St., Redwood City, CA 94025-1957). This excellent PC- based software provides statistics that are based on unexplained sightings recorded by Project BLUE BOOK and by other organi- zations (civilian UFO groups). If Project BLUE BOOK investigators explained some sightings as the U-2, these sightings would not appear in the list of unexplained BLUE BOOK sightings and hence would not be in- cluded in this database. On the other hand, the far larger collection of non-Blue Book sightings in this database could include U-2 sightings, if the CIA is correct, that were not identified by civilian investigators who were unaware of the U-2's existence. Hence a comparison of the sighting statistics be- fore and after U-2 flights started could pro- vide evidence that the U-2 was being re- ported as a UFO.

The large increase in November, 1957 occurred just after Sputnik 2 was launched. (This flap is noted for the large number of close-range car-stopping events. Most of the sightings were not sightings of Sputnik itself.) An even more telling set of statistics uses the sightings which occurred near sunrise or sunset when, according to Mr. Haines, the U-2 would have appeared as a shiny or fiery bright spot in the sky.

In fact, the number of sight- ings during the evening time period was lower in August, 1955, than during July. In the early 1960s many of the U-2s were painted black or other camouflage colors, thus reducing the number of U-2's that could potentially be seen by glint reflection from the sun. Hence the probability of see- ing one was even less than before. Aside from the statistics it should be pointed out that many of the unexplained sightings involved relatively nearby, struc- tured objects rather than far distant, nearly invisible points of light. Many of the unidentified objects were reported to move rapidly at apparent (angular) speeds that would far exceed the apparent speed of a U- 2 (about 500 mph) flying at 60 - 70,000 ft (the U-2 would seem to move slowly, if seen at all). The documented history of the agency in- volvement has been published in Clear Intent by Larry Fawcett and Barry Greenwood, in UFOs, The Public Deceived by Philip Klass (in my opinion, Phil de- ceived the public!), in Above Top Secret by Timothy Good, and most recently in The FBI-UFO Connection/the REAL X-files by Bruce Maccabee (available from the au- thor).

Investigator: John Thompson A hovering object was seen in the south by a young mechanic who was driving northwest toward LaGrange, Georgia on Stoval Road in the twilight of the day. The white orb he observed was smaller than the full moon at arm's length but many times larger than a star, which, at several miles away, was thought to be the size of a car. He slowed as he approached the object, as if to study it closely, but his effort was in vain. The object suddenly shot \"straight up at a high rate of speed,\" moving out of sight in four or five seconds. Afterward, he guessed the object's rate of climb to be \"faster than a helicopter but slower than a jet.\" You are correct to guess that this incident may have a conventional explanation, it's presented here because of the other two sightings.

Investigator: Beverly Trout Driving on Merle Hay road in Des Moines in the early evening on a cold but clear day, a married couple — one a mem- ber of MUFON — saw what appeared to be a dull black object, possibly a triangle, at an altitude of 1,000 — 1,500 feet one block to the west of them. \"That's a UFO!\" one of them exclaimed. \"Let's chase it!\" The two turned onto Cumming's Parkway and headed in the general direc- tion of the object, but to no avail. The craft moved to the southeast, away from the road. They saw lights on two edges of the object as it slowly left.

On the sides, smaller red lights were to the inside of each white light, and a blue light was at the center. They estimated the object to be about 100 feet long and 20- 30 feet tall. By the time the couple had driven a few blocks and reached University Avenue, they had lost sight of the vehicle. They attempted to locate it again but were unsuccessful. The investigator contacted the FAA, Des Moine's Police, the Polk County Sheriff, and the Drake Observatory without finding corroborating reports.

Farther away and to the east of their posi- tion, the craft could only be seen for a few seconds. Two miles past highway 100, all three in the car saw the object for about five seconds. During this short time, they saw an oblong, smaller craft, having a grayish color, possibly having wings, and travelling about the speed of a conventional propeller plane, almost on a collision course with the oddity. As the oblong craft passed the ob- ject, both of them vanished. The investigator contacted the county Sheriff's Department and was told there had been a UFO report on their recorder, and there had also been a white helicopter in the area about the same time. The witnesses said what they saw was not a helicopter. A person living near where the sighting was made was contacted, but the person had not seen either an anomalous object or a heli- copter. The investigator claims that many reports of unexplained, anomalous objects seen in this area have been made in the past, including April 1995.

Investigator: John Thompson On three separate occasions, the witness saw an object in the vicinity of highway 27 between LaGrange and Franklin, Georgia. The first two occurred on two nights in a row, and one two days before the third. The first, which he observed for about 15 sec- onds as he drove on, was about a half mile away, hovering over a ridge line. The sec- ond was moving from the southwest to the northeast very slowly, and he watched it for about 30 seconds. Both were at treetop alti- tude. During the third sighting — which in- volved an object he thought was the same as the two earlier sightings, but four miles far- ther south — the witness watched the tree- top-level, huge craft fly directly overhead, coming within 100 feet. The witness was driving south on high- way 27 and saw multicolored lights flicker- ing through the trees to his right. He looped the car around to face the lights and stopped at the intersection with the entrance to Grayson's Landing to watch it approach. Moving at a speed less than 20 mph, a 250- 300 foot long cigar-shaped vehicle loomed over him, blinking some of its 10 white, green and red lights as it passed. Both ends of the shape were rounded. The witness made out a several-foot-wide indentation in the dark, non-metallic surface. The recess was across its flat, 100-foot width, at its middle and gave him the impression of a doorway that \"could open up.\" The object continued its journey to the northeast and went out of sight behind the trees. At about 09:00 hours on February 17, 1997 an area near LaGrange, Georgia experi- enced a small earth tremor having a magni- tude of 2.0 on the Richter scale, which was apparently accompanied by a \"loud sonic boom, \" according to one witness. Later that day and the next, three sightings of anom- alous objects occurred, which makes one wonder if the sightings and the tremor were somehow related. The airport, police, and Atlanta FAA all indicated they had not re- ceived any cal/s regarding unusual aircraft that evening.

The red, blue, white, and yellow lights were in a group like a tri- angle, but no triangular object's surface was seen. The assembly of lights passed on by them, then out of sight, without a sound.

Investigator: John Thompson Watching television and sipping a cup of coffee in her country abode outside of Glenn, Georgia, a middle-aged insurance agent looked out her window to see a group of about 15 white lights in a row, in the southwest and moving slowly eastward. The anomaly was at a low (treetop) altitude, and the assemblage was about the size of a base- ball at arm's length. Each light appeared to be square, like a window possibly \"six feet square.\" They were each bright, but the col- lection did not illuminate ground surfaces. The string of lights appeared to curve to the rear at each end, suggesting they were on the outside of a circular object \"at least 90 feet\" in diameter, according to the witness, but no object surface was seen. Keying on the estimated size of the ob- ject, the investigator first suspected a blimp and called the LaGrange-Calloway airport, but they were not aware of anything that could produce such a sighting. Additionally, neither the owners of a nearby store nor a neighbor to the witness had seen anything unusual that evening; they had not had the opportunity. Also on February 17, about 300 miles from LaGrange, Georgia, a sighting was made in Mississippi. This sighting occurred about six hours after the tremor and six hours before any of the sightings in Georgia. LOG # 970514bC: FB-1, 02/17/97, Biloxi, MS, at 14:30 hours, for 7 minutes.

A middle-aged USAF dentist was clean- ing his carport when he heard jet aircraft and looked up to watch them cross over- head. At the same time, he glimpsed some- thing shiny to the northwest and turned to see a bright object at a distance. Realizing this was not a typical aircraft, he rushed into the house to get his binoculars. When he came back out to look, the single object was now four bright lights. He focused his 7x35 binoculars on one of the objects and studied it closely, finding it to be shaped like a disc. Six lights were on the bottom, one in the center and the others around the bottom edge. Bright white, the object switched to red, then back to white before it was out of sight. The investigators talked to the local po- lice and Keesler AFB trying to find corrob- orating information, but without luck.

Scott Grain, Jr. frustrating problem in solving the UFO mystery is that nobody has pro- ed a flying saucer for scientific study, which is not to say a UFO has not fallen into government hands. In fact, it was admitted by Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher, an American scientist who worked for the U. S. Defense Department, that a crashed alien craft and its occupants has been in the pos- session of the American authorities since the late 1940s. But is it true? Sarbacher's alleged knowledge of UFO retrievals became apparent on September 15, 1950, during a meeting to discuss mat- ters of national defense at his Washington office with a group of Canadian government scientists and engineers. Dr. Sarbacher, an American physicist, was at the time, speak- ing in his capacity as a science consultant for the U. S. Defense Department's Research & Development Board, headed by Vannevar Bush. Sarbacher served on the Guided Missile Committee. The content of the meeting was penned in a memo by Canadian Scientist Wilbert B. Smith. What follows is a transcript of that meeting. Sept 15, 1950 — Notes on [an] interview through Lt/C. Bremner with Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher. WBS I am doing some work on the col- lapse of the earth's magnetic field as a source of energy, and I think our work may have a bearing on the fly- ing saucers. RIS What do you want to know? WBS I have read Scully's book on the saucers, and I would like to know how much of it is true. RIS The facts reported in the book are substantially correct. WBS Then the saucers exist? RIS Yes, they exist. WBS Do they operate as Scully sug- gests—on magnetic principles? RIS We have not been able to duplicate their performance. WBS So they come from some other planet? RIS All we know is, we didn't make them, and it's pretty certain they didn't originate on the earth. WBS I understand the whole subject of saucers is classified. RIS Yes, it is classified two points higher than the H-bomb. In fact, it is the most highly classified subject in the U.S. Government at the present time. WBS May I ask the reason for the classifi- cation? RIS You may ask, but I can't tell you. WBS Is there any way in which I can get some information, particularly as it might fit in with our own work? RIS I suppose you could be cleared through your own Defense Department, and I am pretty sure arrangements could be made to ex- change information. If you have anything to contribute, we would be glad to talk it over, but I can't give you any more at the present time. Note: The above is written out from mem- ory following the interview. I have tried to keep it as nearly verbatim as possible [WBS]. UNBELIEVABLE ALLEGATIONS These are, to say the least, startling re- marks made by a prominent scientist work- ing for the upper echelons of the govern- ment. Sarbacher implies that UFOs ( flying saucers ) are probably extraterrestrial, that scientists are working on how they fly, and that the whole project is as secret as it gets. If the project is classified two points (what- ever that is) higher than the H-bomb, why is Sarbacher openly discussing these activities with our Canadian counterparts? If Sarbacher did have access to information of the magnitude he describes, did he not have to sign a security agreement about divulging such high level classified information? Smith's attempts to find out more details about Sarbacher's remarks were, for the most part, unsuccessful. However, three months later, Smith was put in charge of a short-lived UFO investigation, Project Magnet, under the auspices of the Department of Transport, for the Canadian Government. Smith died in 1961, and even- tually many of Smith's personal papers came into the possession of Authur Bray, a Canadian researcher. Bray mentioned Smith's memo during his lecture at the 1982 Mutual UFO Network symposium which caught the attention of another researcher, T.

A review of the contact is best described by Jerome Clark, editor of the International UFO Reporter, in his authoritative book, UFOs in the 1980s: The UFO Encyclopedia, Volume 1. Clark writes: \"When he spoke with him over the phone, Friedman .learned immediately that Sarbacher had not been, Bray to the con- trary, \"deeply involved in UFO research for the U.S. government.\" He did confirm the essentials of the Smith account but said his knowledge of the UFO project was based only on what he had heard from other scien- tists who were involved. At one point, he said, he had been invited to Wright- Patterson Air Force Base to hear a presenta- tion by scientists and military men who were studying UFO remains, but other pressing business had kept him from attend- ing. Sarbacher said his colleagues had told of wreckage and bodies, but with the pas- sage of years his memory had grown hazy about the specifics. He said he did not know why the matter had been covered up all these years.\" Friedman met Sarbacher in early 1983, but little more was learned that had not al- ready been discussed on the phone. Friedman mentioned his conversation with Sarbacher to a colleague of his, UFO writer William L. Moore, who later relayed the de- tails to UFO enthusiast William S. Steinman. Steinman wrote Sarbacher sev- eral letters, and finally received a response from Sarbacher, dated November 29, 1983. The contents were quite revealing. Sarbacher writes: I am sorry I have taken so long in an- swering your letters. However, I have moved my office and have had to make a number of extended trips. To answer your last question in your let- ter of October 14, 1983, there is no particu- lar reason I feel I shouldn't or couldn't an- swer any or all of your questions. I am de- lighted to answer all of them to the best of my ability. You listed some of your questions in your letter of September 12th. I will attempt to answer them as you had listed them. 1. Relating to my own expexience re- garding recovered flying saucers, I had no association with any of the people involved in the recovery and have no knowledge re- garding the dates of the recoveries. If I had I would send it to you. 2. Regarding verification that persons you list were involved, I can only say this: John von Neuman was definitely involved. Dr. Vannever Bush was definitely involved, and I think Dr. Robert Oppenheimer also. My association with the Research and Development Board under Doctor Compton during the Eisenhower administration was rather limited so that although I had been invited to participate in several discussions associated with the reported recoveries, I could not personally attend the meetings. I am sure that they would have asked Dr. von Braun, and the others that you listed were probably asked and may or may not have at- tended. This is all I know for sure. 3.1 did receive some official reports when I was in my office at the Pentagon but all of these were left there as at the time we were never supposed to take them out of the office. 4.1 do not recall receiving any photo- graphs such as you request so I am not in a position to answer. 5. I have to make the same reply as on No. 4. I recall the interview with Dr. Brenner of the Canadian Embassy. I think the answers I gave him were the ones you listed. Naturally, I was more familiar with the sub- ject matter under discussion, at that time. Actually, I would have been able to give more specific answers had I attended the meetings concerning the subject. You must understand that I took this assignment as a private contribution. We were called \"dol- lar-a-year men.\" My first responsibility was the maintenance of my own business activ- ity so that my participation was limited. About the only thing I remember at this time is that certain materials reported to have come from flying saucer crashes were extremely light and very tough. I am sure our laboratories analyzed them very care- fully. There were reports that instruments or people operating these machines were also of very light weight, sufficient to withstand the tremendous deceleration and accelera- tion associated with their machinery. I re- member in talking with some of the people at the office that I got the impression these \"aliens\" were constructed like certain in- sects we have.observed on earth, wherein because of the low mass the inertia! forces"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL involved in operation of these instruments would be quite low.

[End quote] BACKGROUND & ANALYSIS Even skeptics would agree that Dr. Sarbacher's background is exceptional. In our book, UFOs, MJ-12 & The Government, Canadian UFO researcher Grant Cameron and I reported on some of Sarbacher's past accomplishments. Dr. Sarbacher's credentials are impres- sive: he was a graduate of the University of Florida (B.S., 1933), Princeton University (M.S., 1934), Harvard University (Sc.D., 1939). He served as a Harvard instructor in physics and communications engineering (1936-40) and was a professor of electrical engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology (1940-42). Sarbacher was a professor at Harvard in 1941, a wartime sci- ence consultant for the U.S. Navy from 1942-45, and dean of the graduate school of the Georgia Institute of Technology from 1945-49. He was an inventor and helped au- thor such technical works as Hyper and Ultra-High Frequency Engineering ( 1944). In the 1980s he was President of the Washington Institute of Technology. Sarbacher's job on the R & D Board would definitely put him in a position to have access to sensitive high-level informa- tion, and may have been privy to details about UFO retrievals, if they existed. All of those who contacted Sarbacher, including William Steinman, author of UFO Crash At Aztec, Jerome Clark, who interviewed Sarbacher for an OMNI article, Bruce Maccabee, of the Fund for UFO Research and Barry Greenwood, for an article in Just Cause, a UFO newsletter, were impressed with Sarbacher's seeming sincerity, and his willingness to answer questions as best he could. His story is fairly consistent with these UFO researchers who interviewed him, and sounds like the truth as he may have understood it. CREDIBILITY QUESTIONS The story sounds so credible on the sur- face, most UFO researchers assume Robert Sarbacher's testimony is valid, even though there is no corroboration for it. But there are problems in the story that go deeper than no confirmation. According to an article in the September 1985 issue of Just Cause, editor Barry Greenwood explained that Sarbacher be- came involved with the UFO evidence due to his connection with the Research and Development Board. Greenwood writes: \"Sarbacher's role with the R&DB was as Chairman of the Guidance and Control Panel of the Guided Missile Committee of the R&DB.\" \"The R&DB meetings were not necessar- ily UFO meetings per se but were part of their regular schedule and UFOs came up among other subjects under discussion. Sarbacher told me that since he did not at- tend the meetings, he had only heard snip- pets of stories which others more closely in- volved in the meetings had heard. This in- cluded the information in his 11/29/83 letter to Steinman. The crash/retrieval data origi- nally came from Wright Field, as Sarbacher recalls.\" A contrasting version of the R & D Board meetings comes from Fred A. Darwin, who was the Executive Director of the Guided Missile Committee for the R & D Board from 1949-54. Darwin was a good friend of Sarbacher's. He met him while at Harvard University where he, William Edson and Sarbacher studied a lot together. In a letter to me in August, 1988, Darwin writes: \"I wish that I could give you news more likely to be welcome: The RDB took a rather dim view of UFO's. Not that UFO's do not exist; they have existed, probably since the beginning of time. Vehicles from outer space are, however, another proposi- tion.\" The Public Affairs Division of Wright- Patterson Air Force Base also takes a dim view of Sarbacher's assertion that the crash/retrieval data originated from their lo- cation. In a fact sheet, dated January 1985, it states: \"Periodically, it is erroneously stated that the remains of extraterrestrial visitors are or have been stored at Wright-Patterson AFB. There are not now, nor ever have been, any extraterrestrial visitors or equipment on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\" Sarbacher's job on the R & D Board would defi- nitely put him in a position to have ac- cess to sen- sitive high- level informa- tion, and he may have been privy to details about UFO re- trievals, if they existed.

First let's examine Sarbacher's recollection of those days on the R&D Board. In a telephone interview with Stan Friedman, Sarbacher states: S: And ah, Fred came to me and asked me if I would help him on the guidance and control. F: I see. S: For the missiles? F: Ya he was chairman for that subcom- mittee. S: Ya that's right. F: Or went on to be anyway. S: That's right and I came down and I was in that, and worked on it, for a long time and I guess it was over a year, maybe a couple of years, I don't know, I don't remember. But I know it was dur- ing that time we had an office there that we all went to. You know. F: The Research and Development Board? S: Ya the Research and Development Board. It was sorta like a little cabinet post. F: OK so the guys there told you about the UFO's? S: Ya it was among those fellows in conver- sation. F: Remember any of those guys? S: Not a one. Not a one. Fred would know them all. I should think that some- where among his files he would have a list of all the men that worked there. F: Oh ya. He did. As a matter of fact he had names at his fingertips so to speak. S: Ya I know, Fred was right in the middle of it. Sarbacher stated he worked on the R&D Board for a long time, perhaps a year or two. However, Darwin provided me with a different perspective of Sarbacher's partici- pation on the Missile Committee. Darwin writes: \"Bob Sarbacher (originally known as Irving) had virtually no connection with the activities of the Research and Development Board. (More's the pity.) I got Bob ap- pointed to membership on the Guidance and Control Panel. After a couple of months, the Chairman requested his replacement; he never came to the meetings. Bob had talents that could have been valuable.\" OTHER SCIENTISTS INVOLVED? In Sarbacher's 1983 letter to William Steinman, he writes that those having knowledge of UFO retrievals and who were \"definitely involved\" were John von Neuman and Vannevar Bush, \"and I think Dr. Robert Oppenheimer also.\" Again, I questioned Darwin about some of the names Sarbacher offered along with a few others, and he responded: \"Of the people listed on page 2 of your letter, I knew pretty well Johnny von Neuman, Wernher von Braun, Robert Oppenheimer, Vannevar Bush, Detlev Bronk, and Lloyd Berkner. None of those was ever convinced that vehicles from outer space even existed.\" One would think that the Director of the Missile Committee would have had some knowledge of a UFO retrieval or a meeting about crash hardware and aliens at Wright- Patterson AFB if it happened as Sarbacher claims. Darwin makes no mention in his let- ter to me that any such discussions took place. Another, source I contacted who knew Sarbacher well, and was in close contact with him from 1935 to 1950, recalled hav- ing no conversations with him about UFO research. He described Bob as \"brillant\" and \"charming,\" but doubted whether some of the statements Sarbacher makes are entirely truthful. Sarbacher told Friedman he had a prob- lem remembering the names of those men serving on the R&D Board. For the record, the United States Government Organization Manual 1951-52 indicates the following list of names serving as the R&D Board mem- bers during this period: Chairman, William Webster; Deputy Chairman, James A. Perkins; Army members Archibald S. Alexander and Major General Ward S. Maris; Navy members Dan A. Kimball and Rear Admiral M. E. Curtis; and Air Force members John A. McCone and Major General Gordon P. Seville. Dr. Eric A. Walker served as Executive Secretary. The R&D Board was established by the National Security Act of 1947, and was set up to ad- vise the Secretary of Defense on trends of scientific research affecting national secu- rity, and to promote research and develop- ment among the services involving security- type scientific problems. STRIEBER S TALE Earlier versions of Sarbacher's story were fairly consistent. But in 1986, shortly before he died, it is alleged his story became more elaborate and detailed. According to"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL science fiction writer Whitley Strieber in his 1995 book Breakthrough, Sarbacher told him on the phone the UFO debris had some unusual properties. \"That fabric we ob- tained at Roswell had molecular welds so small you couldn't even identify what they were until the sixties, when the microscopes to do it became available.\" Strieber said that Sarbacher indicated the analysis of the de- bris was helpful in making seamless coat- ings that would cover \"radar-proof aircraft, which eventually evolved into the Stealth.\" Strieber said he asked Sarbacher if he had seen the material and he reportedly replied that he had not only seen it, but examined and studied it. Asked if the material was of a non-human origin, Strieber said he an- swered, \"What I can be certain about is that it was not produced by any technology that we were aware of in 1947. Or now.\" In all fairness, Sarbacher was getting up in age, and perhaps his memory was not what it used to be. Strieber's account is also suspect, because it seems to contradict one of his earlier books, Communion, where he indicates he only learned of Steinman's let- ter after Sarbacher's death, and \"...was un- able to interview him ...\" I wrote to Strieber on April 13, 1997, for clarification, and in mid-May he sent me a two-page form letter explaining, \"I wish that I could reply to each of you individually, but the volume of mail prevents me from doing this.\" CORSO'S TALE Support for Sarbacher's claims have re- cently been reported in the 1997 book, The Day After Roswell, by Col. Philip J. Corso (ret.). Corso, who served as the Chief of the Army's Foreign Technology Division in 1961, says Sarbacher was a valuable player, was in close touch with the U.S. Govern- ment's UFO working group, and was instru- mental in helping General Nathan F. Twining decide to move the Roswell crash saucer debris to Wright-Field for a prelimi- nary examination. Although this all sounds very interesting, there was no evidence that I could see to support these points. Corso could very well say Sarbacher was involved based on Sarbacher's own remarks regarding his in- volvement, and created a story using Sarbacher based on previous research al- ready found in the literature. Corso also reported in his book that alien artifacts that have been recovered have been reverse engineered by earthly scientists, re- sulting in the development of lasers, fiber optics, integrated circuit chips and super tenacity fibers by some of the nation's largest companies. The companies have publicly admitted on nationwide television they have no knowledge of this, but Corso says it was meant to be that way. It all sounds a little too easy, and until Corso coughs up supporting documents and de- tailed notes supporting his claims, these al- legations cannot be taken seriously. CONCLUSIONS All the allegations Sarbacher reported could still be true, but there are inconsisten- cies as well as Darwin's remarks that cast a shadow of doubt over Sarbacher's testi- mony. I discussed some of these discrepan- cies with an associate, Grant Cameron, who suggested that Darwin could have been left out of the loop, and that Sarbacher was asked to attend UFO meetings because of his technical expertise. The alleged group asked to attend meetings at Wright- Patterson AFB may have been on a need to know basis, and Darwin didn't need to know. When researcher Bruce Maccabee in- terviewed Sarbacher on August 5, 1985, Sarbacher explained it \"... as something I should have done but didn't do. I had had a request to visit a site...(either the site was Wright Field or the request came from there)... regarding a fallen... UFO and at that time could not go...tied up with per- sonal business.\" He went on to tell Maccabee that, \"Some of the men went. I went to the office some time after they got back and talked to some of the guys who saw it. I wish I could have gone.\" Looking at this situation another way, one could say Sarbacher simply overheard some of the guys talking around the water cooler about alleged UFO crashes and bod- ies that were discussed at the meeting, mayjje even the situation at Roswell came up, and Sarbacher began to fill in the blanks. Sarbacher openly admitted he had no first-hand knowledge of the UFO crashes, did not attend the R&D meetings where they may have been discussed, and according to Darwin, didn't show up at too many Missile Committee meetings either. It seems very odd that Sarbacher would pass up an opportunity to attend an event this ex- traordinary because of personal business. Dr. Sarbacher did identify to researcher William Steinman a member of the R&D Board who he said attended all the UFO Sarbacher openly admit- ted he had no firsthand knowledge of the UFO crashes, did not attend the R&D Board meetings where they may have been dis- cussed ... and didn't show up at too many Missile Com- mittee meet- ings either.

Cameron and I investigated Walker for several years, but we could never get Walker to admit to us that he par- ticipated in UFO retrieval discussions while at the R&D Board. However, Steinman claims he had a telephone interview with Walker in which he admitted attending UFO meetings at Wright-Patterson AFB and was familiar with a group known as \"MJ-12,\" an alleged group of military and government officials brought together under President Truman to oversee UFO recovery opera- tions. Since that interview with Steinman on August 30, 1987, in all follow-up interviews with us and others, Walker has proved elu- sive in answering direct questions about UFO retrievals. Walker died on February 17, 1995. RUMORS TO THE END Dr. Sarbacher died on July 26, 1986, in West Palm Beach, Florida. Hints of a con- spiracy concerning Dr. Sarbacher's death appeared on the internet. One notebook file SX112 dated September 21, 1996 re- ported...\"Why did Dr. Sarbacher 'drown in a boating accident' only TWO DAYS after his third interview in 1983 or so in which he really began naming more names and talk- ing more?\" The source of that comment originated with writer Whitley Strieber. In his book, Breakthrough, Strieber indicated after hav- ing a telephone conversation with Sarbacher in 1986, he forwarded a letter to him via United Parcel Service outlining some expe- riences he had had. Strieber writes, \"I didn't hear anything for a while, then received a telephone call from UPS. They could not deliver because the recipient was deceased. The UPS driver had been told that he had fallen off his boat and drowned.\" An Alexa Cameron questioned Strieber by E-Mail about the admission, and he replied on September 22, 1996. Strieber repeated the UPS story he said he was told, and wrote, \"I never researched this any further. The fact is that he died at a very inopportune time for me, and that was where my interest in the matter ended.\" If Strieber had followed up, he would have discovered that Sarbacher died of heart failure according to the newspaper account appearing in the July 29, 1986 issue of The Palm Beach Post. There was no boating accident. Sarbacher was 79 years old. Sarbacher leaves behind an extraordinary file of possible government involvement and cover-up of a retrieved UFO and its pi- lots. But lacking corraborating evidence to support these claims, it remains one of many reports that remains unverified. Letters to Mufon UFO Journal DISGRUNTLED S peaking as a MUFON Consultant and a Psychotherapist-Hypnotherapist with many years of research and work with ab- ductees, 1 do not believe that my Journal should be used to debunk the UFO phenom- enon generally nor the Roswell crash specif- ically. I was astounded and irate that the edi- tor would give Kent Jeffrey fifteen pages out of a total of eighteen pages to expound his negative views about the Roswell incident. Whether he has been co-opted or he has sim- ply had a change of heart is not relevant. This is not the first time you have given over my journal to debunkers, but if it is not the last, you no longer represent my thinking and have no further need of my membership dues or my services. Reading of Kent Jeffrey's conversion is reminiscent of Robert MacNamara's mea culpa after he sent 58,000 Americans to their deaths in VietNam, only to state last year that he had made a mistake! Moreover, Jeffrey's apologia is replete with contradictions. To begin with, he uses the film Roswell as an example of exagger- ated statements. No one familiar with the Roswell affair believed the film was any- thing other than a popularized and fictional- ized version of events. Jeffrey is disingenu- ous when he cites the film as a factual expli- cation of events in New Mexico in 1947, and then proceeds to point out its exaggerations and shortcomings. When he writes of the discredited MU- FON Board Member and author, once again he sets up a straw man in order to destroy him. He embarks on pseudo-philosophical musings concerning the relationship of ad- vanced technology to reliability, using mod- ern airliners as his medium. Modern airliners are wondrous examples of 1990s state of the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL art aircraft technology, but they do crash on occasion with terrible loss of life. Many such crashes are due to pilot error, others to weather conditions such as icing, lightning, and wind shear. Is it too much to expect that even the most advanced space-craft may similarly be subject to these same vagaries of wind shear, lightning and pilot error? Jeffrey sarcastically refutes the notion that there are secret hangars at Wright-Patterson, and throughout his article asks us to use our common sense and be logical. I believe I am being logical when I ask Mr. Jeffrey to con- sider the response of Air Force General Curtis LeMay to Senator Barry Goldwater when he asked LeMay if he could have ac- cess to these secret hangars where alien bod- ies and space-craft were reported to be housed: LeMay is alleged to have retorted \"Hell no, and don't ask again.\" A strange re- sponse to make to a United States Senator, Air Force General and Presidential candi- date, particularly if there were no alien bod- ies or artifacts hidden. Wouldn't a more logi- cal response have been, \"there is nothing to see, Barry. The whole thing is a myth. We have no alien bodies or space-craft?\" Concerning the 509th Bomb Group, Jeffrey states that a \"very elite group of indi- viduals\" comprised the 509th, yet he obvi- ously believes that the Intelligence Officer for that elite outfit, the only atomic bomb wing in the entire world, could not tell the difference between a weather balloon and what he believed to be extraterrestrial debris. Abandoning his own logical stance, Jeffrey rather illogically asks us to believe that a ju- nior level weather officer easily identified the debris that Colonel Blanchard, Lt. Haul and Major Marcel, who all saw and handled the wreckage, obviously could not identify. Would they have issued the flying saucer news release had they recognized the debris? Obviously not. Mr. Jeffrey places great importance on the fact that Jack Ingham had no knowledge of anything unusual occurring at Roswell in 1947. He tells us that Ingham retired as a Lt. Colonel in 1971.1 mean no disrespect to Col. Ingham when I state that Lt. Colonel is not a very exalted rank to attain after at least 25 years in the service. In 1946, he very probably was a 2nd Lieutenant. Is it logical for us to believe that a mere second lieu- tenant should have been privy to top level secrets in 1946? I think not. Jeffrey also asks us to believe that the pilots and bombardiers he interviewed \"heard nothing about the supposed crashed-saucer incident until years later, after all the publicity started.\" Are we to believe that these \"elite\" intelligent offi- cers had their heads in the sand and were not aware of the Roswell news release, the queries from all over the world, the fuss in Roswell, and learned about a possible saucer crash only years later? Absurd! Jeffrey ac- knowledges that \"the word was already out - the story had been published in afternoon newspapers all over the Western United States!\" It is interesting how Jeffrey treats the tes- timony and recollections of the witnesses he chooses to mention. When the pilots and bombardiers he interviews profess to know nothing about a UFO crash, he accepts their statements without question. However, he casually dismisses out of hand the testimony of other witnesses whose testimony would apparently refute Jeffrey's theory. \"...Because the debris recovered outside of Roswell in 1947 was not extraterrestrial,\" Jeffrey states, \"none of the other witness tes- timony really matters.\" In one fell swoop, Jeffrey simply declares the testimony of dozens, perhaps hundreds of witnesses, to be unimportant. Jeffrey similarly dismisses the testimony of Henderson's family. Their memories are faulty and they got it mixed up, he says, with something they read. Sure, Mr. Jeffrey, but the testimony of Henderson's friend Jesse Mitchell is \"incon- trovertible.\" He no doubt remembers every- thing very clearly and correctly, Jeffrey asks us to believe. It's only the memories of those who recall seeing alien bodies that have eroded over time. And of course Walter Klimkowski is unimpeachable as a witness. After all, he comes highly recommended. He played the piano for stripper Gypsy Rose Lee! Jeffrey concludes his incredible recanta- tion by stating \"...we don't yet have tangible evidence that alien spacecraft exist...\" Mr. Jeffrey is quite free of course to as- sess the evidence and to arrive at any judg- ment he wishes concerning the existence of UFOs. He is certainly free to change his mind about an alien spacecraft crash at Roswell. What he does not have is the right to a fifteen page essay in the journal of an organization devoted to demonstrating that UFOs and aliens are real. MUFON is not a debating society which presents both sides of the question of UFOs and aliens. MU- FON is an advocacy organization whose ac- tivities are supported primarily by the dues And of course Jeffrey's Walter Klimkowski is unimpeach- able as a wit- ness. After all, he comes highly recom- mended. He played the pi- ano for strip- per Gypsy Rose Lee!

By devoting any space whatsoever to Jeffrey, let alone just about the entire issue, you have placed our organization in the position of having pulled the rug out from under the countless abductees who, rebuffed at so many turns, found solace in knowing one important organization supported them. I want to see articles in our journal which sup- port those abductees. Do Phil Klass and oth- ers of his ilk at CSICOP provide a platform for MUFON members? Why should we pro- vide space for those who oppose our beliefs? Don't the editors and leaders of our organi- zation understand the joy Mr. Jeffrey's arti- cle provided our critics, and the consterna- tion he caused our allies? What is at stake here is not some theoreti- cal issue of freedom of the press. Mr. Jeffrey is entitled to his opinions, but he is not enti- tled to have them printed in our Journal. By publishing this article, the officers of MU- FON have called into question their judg- ment and their commitment. By their ac- tions, they have also called into question their fitness to continue to serve as the lead- ers of the Mutual U.F.O. Network. They have driven a stake into the heart of our or- ganization. The implications for their ill- conceived actions are so terrible and serious I tremble for the continued vitality of our or- ganization in the months ahead. Resignations are in order for all those in- volved in this meretricious exercise. The Editors also owe an apology to all MUFON members and particularly to the countless number of abductees who by the thoughtless actions of Jeffrey and those Editors now find themselves adrift without the support of the one international organization which hereto- fore provided them with the support they need so badly. — Dr. Walter T. Schoen, Ph.D. Editor's Note: Dr. Schoen is speaking for himself, just like Kent Jeffrey has done. However, the statements made in the last two paragraphs, where he condemns the editors and officers of the Mutual UFO Network are entirely unwarranted. The MUFON Board of Directors determines the policies of MU- FON, not Dr. Schoen. — Walt Andrus ROSWELL & REALITY My name is Chris Brethwaite and I'm a MUFON member here in Kansas City, Missouri. I'm writing to commend you on the job you've done as editor of MUFON's \"UFO Journal.\" As a professional writer and adjunct college professor, I appreciate your efforts at trying to inject some level of scholarship into the UFO debate. Judging by some of the things I read in , the August issue of the Journal, it appears that the UFO faithful are somewhat dis- pleased with you because of your refusal to go along with every new claim and unsub- stantiated story that comes down the ex- traterrestrial highway. I know that your edi- torship is on shaky ground, but I implore you not to give in to those who would have the Journal become a printed version of \"The Art Bell Show.\" Though there may be some ways to improve the Journal, such as by publishing a list each month of places currently experiencing UFO activity, the bottom line is that we need a publication that addresses the subject in a serious man- ner, and which isn't afraid to police its own by pointing out dubious claims, shoddy re- search and selective reporting. I was also displeased to learn that you re- ceived a lot of criticism for printing Kent Jeffrey's Roswell article in the June issue. I thought his piece was well reasoned, well researched and well written. Though I'm still at a loss to explain how an Air Force Major, who was an intelligence officer, could have mistaken balloon debris for an alien spacecraft, I am nonetheless forced to agree with Kent that maybe that's exactly what happened. I first started thinking that Roswell might be a myth when I visited Walter Haul's UFO museum and noticed the similarity between Jessie Marcel Jr.'s I- beam and Project Mogul debris. Many of the concerns that Kent raised in his article are things that I have wondered about over the years also. For example, why wasn't there a greater variety of debris? Questions like these need to be addressed. It's just un- ^ fortunate that so many MUFON members are so desperate to believe in aliens that any negative information is viewed as heresy. Interestingly enough, I know for a fact that we have been visited by extraterrestri- als. And ironically, it happened in New Mexico exactly twenty years after Roswell. This is the Reader's Digest version of my"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL close encounter. I was twelve years-old at the time, living with my family in the Sandia Foothills on the northeast side of Albuquerque. One night during the summer of 1967,1 went to go next door to return a basketball to my best friend, Scott Everett, and noticed an unusual light in the sky southwest of my house. Together, Scott and I watched this light travel north, turn to the northeast, perform a series of zigzag moves and then disappear over Sandia Peak. The object returned the next two nights. On the third night, the object stopped dead in the air after performing the zigzag moves. Shortly thereafter, Scott walked over to me and said, \"Chris, I just saw an orange man on the school roof.\" A reference to the Hoover Elementary School that was directly across the street from us, probably about a hunderd feet away. I walked over to the curb and had Scott show me exactly where he had seen this \"man.\" All I could see was the black of night, and I was just getting ready to turn away, when all of a sudden, a seven-foot tall, luminous orange man ap- peared right where I was looking. Less than two seconds later he was gone, but I have absolutely no doubt as to what I saw. As for his appearance, I was quite sur- prised at how human he looked. He had two arms, two legs, a torso, and a slightly elon- gated head. He stood very erect and looked to be quite muscular. Because of the glow and a black speckling that also covered him, I was not able to make out any facial fea- tures. Shortly after he disappeared, the UFO resumed its flight and was not seen again. The only thing I have to add is that one of the members of our group saw an orange light come on [on] the UFO during the time period that Scott and I saw the alien. Needless to say, it was an experience that changed my life. I think one of the ways that it benefitted me is that I know for a fact that we have been visited by a being not of this world. Consequently, I could care less if a sacred UFO case gets debunked. If other sightings are misidentifications or hoaxes (Ed Walters), I want to know about it. It re- ally bothers me to see ufology become so uncritical in its thinking. Most of the UFO literature that's available on the book tables at UFO conferences belongs in a landfill, yet people snatch the stuff up left and right. It's very disheartening. What we need are more people like you, and Jerome Clark and George Wingfield and a few others I could name who endeavor to promote ufology in an intellectually honest manner. Well, that's all I wanted to say. I hope you get to stay on as editor of the Journal. You have done a great job, and you can count on me for my support. —Chris Brethwaite Kansas City, MO Actually, Walter Haut recently resigned from the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell. Glenn Dennis is the current president of same. CIVILIZED DISCOURSE The sorry state of ufology never ceases to depress me. As someone who has devoted most of his adult life to trying to bring san- ity and science to bear on UFOs, I am ap- palled by the notion that you should be drawn and quartered for publishing seeming \"anti-UFO\" articles (or should we say 'questioning ufological orthodoxy'). Since we have an excess of sloppy investigation and wild speculation that is making a mock- ery of science, you are entirely correct to publish thoughtful skeptical pieces like that of Kent Jeffrey. The only genuine editorial issues are the overall balance of material presented, and the credibility and credentials of contribu- tors. But editorial decisions are not easy; for example, both James Moseley and Karl Pflock have certain legitimate credentials, but—in my estimation—seriously lack credibility. Track records of game-playing and manipulation are not conducive to cred- ibility. Still, if you—as editor—choose to publish some of their writings, that is your prerogative, subject to peer review and cri- tique. There is no need to fear ideas that dis- agree with our own provided that a mecha- nism is in place to ensure fair comment. A journal of, by, and for \"believers\" will re- main just that and, at best, will be a poor imitation of a scientific journal. In that con- text, I agree wholeheartedly with Jerome Clark's letter (Journal, August 1997) that whether or not we agree with Jeffrey, he has set a good example of civilized discourse that is all too lacking in the UFO field. My personal view is that Jeffrey is quite sincere and made some cogent arguments, but he lacks the experience and detachment to recognize the flaws—or omissions—in There is no need to fear ideas that dis- agree with our own provided that a mecha- nism is in place to en- sure fair com- ment. A jour- nal of, by, and for \"believers\" will remain just that and, at best, will be a poor imita- tion of a sci- entific journal.

Just like some of the pro-Roswell writers, he seizes on a few points and then leaps to conclusions far be- yond those justified by facts and logic. As a philosophy graduate, I can't help but think of the close parallel to people who have seized on one or two statements in the Bible and founded entirely new religions based on a literal and simplistic interpretation of a narrow portion of the text. In particular, Jeffrey fails to comment on the strong and consistent testimony from many witnesses to the effect that Roswell residents who allegedly had some knowl- edge of a crash were subjected to harsh in- timidation, including threats on their lives. We have their testimony on videotape. Their testimony is totally inconsistent with the idea that what crashed outside of Roswell was merely a Mogul balloon (or —as em- braced by Karl Pflock—crash-test dummies in the 1950s). Jeffrey also overinterprets certain negative testimony from people who may or may not have been in a position to know. Let's face it, something obviously crashed outside of Roswell in 1947, but the evidence is in total disarray as to exactly what it was. The main investigators and au- thors on Roswell have, for the most part, been part of the problem rather than part of the solution. We need a totally fresh ap- praisal of the situation by more objective in- vestigators who are willing to suspend judg- ment (i.e., practice science rather than pre- mature advocacy and territorial defensive- ness). In the same vein, the face-value accep- tance of Philip Corso's story by MUFON \"leading lights,\".despite many obvious problems of internal logic, and despite his rather fanatical far-Right interpretation of history, I find appalling. Maybe there is some truth to his story, but it will not be found out by gullible believers. Your skepti- cal remarks on this issue were entirely ap- propriate. —Richard H.

UFO NEARLY HIT 747 EN ROUTE TO BOSTON, SWISSAIR SAYS Z URICH. Switzerland (AP) — An unidentified, wingless object traveling at high speed passed dangerously close to a Swissair jetliner between Philadelphia and Boston, the airline said Friday. The pilot and copilot gave U.S. investiga- tors different descriptions of the object that passed about 50 yards from the Boeing 747 after it had taken off from Philadelphia on August 9, said the airline. The pilot told the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board that the object was long and wingless, but the copilot said it was more spherical, Swissair spokesman Erwin Schaerer said. The incident took place at 23.000 feet. The plane's final destination was Zurich. (Copyright 1997 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.) September 26, 1997.

Mercury will be the hardest to see from northern latitudes. (Both it and Venus are higher from the southern states.) The parade of planets can be seen at dusk as follows, from W to E: Mercury (magnitude -0.4), low in the WSW (early twilight): Mars (1.1), Sagittarius, SW; Venus (-4.5), Sagittarius, SW; Jupiter (-2.3), Capricornus, S; Saturn (0.5-), Pisces, ESE. Both Venus and Mars set around 7 PM. The two planets and the lunar crescent form a nice triangle on November 3. On the 7th, Jupiter lies near the quarter Moon, while on the 11th Saturn is near the gibbous Moon. In fact, on the latter date states in the Southeast will see the Moon hide the ringed planet for up to an hour starting at 6:25 PM (Miami) or 6:52 (Atlanta), for example. Jupiter sets in the W about 10 PM in midmonth. In addition to seeing all the bright planets at once, Uranus and Neptune may be visible in binoculars or a telescope as well. The former is a 6th-magnitude object in Capricornus; the latter, an 8th-magnitude object in Sagittarius. (For finder charts or coordinates, consult such publications as Observer's Handbook 1997, The Astronomical Almanac 1997. or Sky & Telescope magazine.) Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Saturn sets in the W about 3 AM in mid-November. Meteor Showers: The South Taurid meteors peak during the first week of November at about 10-15 per hour before dawn. Though few in number, the reddish meteors of the Taurids do create some bright fireballs. The \"Leonid watch\" continues as we head toward a possibly spectacular meteor display in 1998 or 1999. Last November observers reported an exceptional number of Leonid fire- balls and an above-average per-hour rate. Though this year's bright gibbous Moon severely hampers viewing, it still may be worth watching the sky during the predawn hours of the 17th for an increase in bright meteors which will emanate from the constellation Leo in the southern sky. Some predictions favor western North America and/or the Pacific for the best chance of seeing a decent show.

The dim autumn constellations of \"The Sea\" and the season's sky symbol Pegasus occupy the middle sky. Be sure to observe the Andromeda spiral galaxy with naked eye, binoculars, or telescope. This system of billions of stars, visible to the unaided eye as an oval patch, lies right on the N-S meridian almost directly overhead at 9 PM in mid- November.

Our new mission is not only a challenge in broad terms, but an unlimited vision for the future. We are indebted to MUFON's Treasurer and Bexar County State Section Director, Thomas M. Whitmore for proposing this mission statement. MOTTO CONTEST Nearly nine hundred mottos were submitted in the con- test, a record surpassing all previous programs of this nature. In their original form, the judges could not find one that literally \"rang the bell,\" that is, catchy, unique, eye appealing and exemplified MUFON's goals and objectives. As previously announced, the judges will be sorting through the entries looking for one or more that is compatible to our new mission statement. Even though this may require making slight wording revi- sions in the motto originally submitted, one or more contestants will be awarded or share $100 in MUFON publications of their choice. MUFON LAPEL PINS The one-inch long oval-shaped lapel pin has the MUFON logo in blue on a white background outlined in gold with a pin clasp on the back suitable for fasten- ing to clothing. You may order yours from MUFON in Seguin, TX for $5 plus $1 for P&H. This is an opportu- nity to let people know that you are a MUFON member by proudly wearing our new lapel pin. The lapel pins are being mailed in a special bubblepack envelope to protect them from damage. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAM Anyone who has purchased and studied the 4th edi- tion of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eli- gible to take the exam via mail when they feel quali- fied. The 100-question test may be secured from MU- FON headquarters in Seguin and returned to Kathleen F. Marden, 103 Willow Road, East Kingston, NH 03827, for grading. In localities where field investigator training classes are conducted, the instructor may order sufficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the conclusion of the training classes. However, the majority of people will study the manual, like a corre- spondence course, before taking the exam. It is an open book test and other references may be utilized to broaden the scope of your knowledge. A passing grade is 75%. A few individuals have re- quested that they want to know which questions they missed. To supply the correct answers would make it possible for them to possess every answer to the test. Obviously, we would not like for them to share their an- swers with colleagues, therefore we have been reluctant to do so. Since a large number of the questions are mul- tiple choice, Mrs. Marden would be willing to advise the examinee which of these questions that was incor- rectly answered by question number only, upon written request. A study is being conducted, based upon questions consistently answered incorrectly, to revise the exam. Some of the true-false questions need rewording or eliminated as an example. A few questions are a mea- sure of the overall knowledge of ufology of the exami- nee, based upon reading the literature. These answers are obviously not in the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. For current members, the new manual may be purchased for $25.00 plus $3.50 for postage and han- dling from MUFON in Seguin. Congratulations to the people who have recently taken the Field Investigator's Exam and received a passing grade. Kathleen Marden now grades the exams and forwards the name and score to MUFON Headquarters, where Ann Knovvles records the grade on your membership application, revises the applica- tion, and mails the new Field Investigator their new I.D. card. As a further incentive to the Field Investigator Trainee to successfully pass the examination, some State Directors are making this a condition before a per- son is promoted to State Section Director. This is a pos- itive means of upgrading the caliber of the MUFON field organization. Obviously, anyone teaching a Field Investigator's Training Class must be a qualified Field Investigator.

If you have not returned your pink survey form, please do so immediately, because we want to know what evolu- tionary changes should be incorporated into your maga- zine. An evaluation of the editor was point number two on the survey. On August 28, 1997, Dennis Stacy offi- cially resigned as Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal effective after the November 1997 issue. Starting with the October 1984 issue, Mr. Stacy has performed meri- torious service to the Mutual UFO Network as editor of our monthly magazine for over thirteen years, longer than any previous editor. He must be highly com- mended for being responsible for the overall improve- ment of our magazine during this period. As a freelance writer, photojournalism and publisher, this will give Dennis an opportunity to explore other exciting fields besides UFOs. Mr. Stacy was originally elected to the MUFON Board of Directors as Director of Publications in 1980 and coedited the Annual MUFON Symposium Proceedings from 1980 through 1984. Walt Andrus is proud to have introduced Dennis to Japanese magazine publishers prior to this time, giving him his first oppor- tunity to write professionally in the UFO field. The MUFON 1993 International UFO Symposium Proceedings were respectfully dedicated to Dennis Stacy in recognition of his editorial services to MU- FON. We all extend our best wishes to Dennis in his new endeavors. NEW JOURNAL EDITOR SELECTED Effective with the December 1997 issue, Dwight Connelly will take over the reins as Editor of the MU- FON UFO Journal for a second time. Mr. Connelly edited our monthly magazine from February 1974 through May 1976 when it was known as SKYLOOK, succeeding the founder in 1967. Mrs. Norma E. Short. Dwight's wife, Carolyn, formerly the business man- ager of SKYLOOK is anxiously anticipating a role in the future of the Journal. Dwight previously taught Journalism at Quincy Senior High School in Quincy, Illinois and is now teaching in the school system in Marshall, IL. He is also a part owner of the newspaper Shoreline Reporter in Treasure Island. Florida and has owned and operated October 1997 Number 354 Page 24 several small town newspapers after leaving Quincy, IL in the late I970's. Mr. Connelly is eminently qualified for this important position based upon his prior journal- istic and publishing experience. The MUFON Executive Committee has recom- mended that Walter H. Andrus, Jr. become the Editor in Chief as well as publisher of the MUFON UFO Journal. NEW DIRECTORS Cesar Remus, State Director for Puerto Rico, has selected Mrs. Luz B. Guzman de Pla (San Juan) to be the Assistant State Director. James E. Delehanty (Jeffersonville) was appointed Assistant State Director for Indiana by Jerry L. Sievers. Four new State Section Directors were appointed this month. They are Leslie G. Salvato, B.A. (Silverdale, WA) for Kitsap County; James G. Bouck, Jr. (Schenectady, NY) for the additional Counties of Albany, Schenectady, Saratoga and Rensselaer; William M. Dungan, Jr. (Crystal Springs, MS) for Copiah, Simpson and Lawrence Counties: and Connie Churchill (Three Rivers, TX) for Live Oak County. Gayle Treadwell, B.S. (Beeville, TX) was reassigned to Bee County. Mrs. Treadwell joined MUFON in 1983. NEW CONSULTANTS AND RESEARCH SPECIALISTS The following new Consultants volunteered their ex- pertise this past month: Charles Albano, Ed.D. (Point Pleasant, NJ) in Education; William H. Hardy, Jr. J.D. (Ada, MI) in Law; and Thomas E. Simpson, Ph.D. (Dublin, OH) in Industrial Design. A new Research Specialist is Philip A. Bayly, M.S. (Largo, FL) in Education. MUFON MISSION STATEMENT At the MUFON Board of Director's Meeting in Grand Rapids, Michigan, each Director was requested to submit a MUFON Mission Statement to identify our goals and objectives. Some very good statements were submitted, however, most were more detailed in scope and some were very specific providing insufficient lati- tude for the future. At the Executive Committee Meeting in Seguin on September 13th, the five officers selected a brief statement that summarizes MUFON's mission for the future without being confining in this very controversial field of study. As one might say, \"it is short and sweet.\" MUFON's Mission is the system- atic collection and analysis of UFO data with the ul- timate goal of learning the origin and nature of the UFO phenomena.
