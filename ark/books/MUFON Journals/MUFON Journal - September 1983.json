FROM THE EDITOR The MUFON UFO Journal is our most significant communication medium to our subscribers, members and the general public and should reflect the goals and objectives of the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. We should never lose sight that the fundamental reason for our existence is a dedicated endeavor to solve the enigma known as unidentified flying objects through investigation, scientific study and research. Since UFOlogy is still considered a controversial science by many in the academe, we must conduct our study and ourselves in a professional manner that will earn the respect of the scientific, academic and political' communities. It is imperative that we maintain an open mind to new ideas and not allow dogmatic or orthodox scientific principles of the twentieth century create obstacles to the new frontiers of science that challenge us. Resolution of the UFO phenomenon may require updating our present physics textbooks to include this new and advanced technology.

Betty Cash (51), Vickie Landrum (57), and Colby Landrum (7), were driving home to Dayton, Texas on the Cleveland-Huffman road just north of Lake Houston. It was around 9 o'clock at night and the road was deserted. The first indication of something unusual was the presence of a very intense light several miles ahead just above the pine trees. Betty remarked about the unusual brightness, but temporarily lost sight of it due to the many trees along the road. After a few minutes passed the bright light moved from a horizontal orientation to a vertical position and came down over the road ahead of their car. Vickie said: \"it was like a diamond of fire.\" The glow was so intense they could barely stand to look at it. Vickie first thought it was the fulfillment of biblical prophesy and expected Jesus to come out of the fire in the sky. In addition to lighting the whole area like daytime, the UFO periodically belched flames downward. Fearing they would be burned alive, Betty stopped the 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass without leaving the road. The car rapidly warmed to an uncomfortable temperature so the trio got out of the car to get a better look. Colby was terrified and dove back into the car begging his grandma to get back in, too. Vickie did and comforted him. Betty stood momentarily by the driver's door and then walked forward to the front of the car. After much pleading by Vickie, Betty returned to the car. The car door and handle was so hot she used her leather coat as a hotpad to open the door. Although the winter night air had been about 40 degrees, the heat from the UFO caused the witnesses to sweat and feel so uncomfortable that they turned on the car's air conditioner. Each time the object would shoot flames downward it would rise. As the flames stopped it would drop in altitude. The intense glow, however, never changed. In addition, the threesome heard an irregular beeping sound throughout the sighting. Finally, the flames stopped, the object rose to the southwest, and was lost from sight over the trees. Vickie and Colby commented several helicopters were in the area. Betty did not see helicopters during the initial phase of the encounter. Vickie said with relief: \"we're safe and we're sound, but I'm burning and it's so hot.\" Betty was directly exposed to the object 5 to 10 minutes, Vickie 3 to 5 minutes, and Colby only a minute or so. As Betty raced homeward she turned right on highway FM2100. Five minutes or more lapsed and just ahead was the UFO and a large numer of helicopters. \"The sky was full of helicopters,\" Betty said. Some were near the object and others lagged far behind. She feared the helicopters would collide. They were dazzled as they counted more than 20 helicopters. According to Vickie, \"The helicopter roar was like a tornado.\" They started up again and sped onward towards home, turning on to the Huffman-Eastgate road, then to Highway FM 1960. By this time the object had been in sight, climbing into the night sky, for another five minutes. On FM 1960, the threesome were going away from the UFO, but could still observe it as a diminishing bright light for 2 or 3 more minutes. The UFO was in sight for more than 20 minutes total. The helicopters were clearly visible to all the witnesses for at least half of the time and two of the witnesses claim to have seen some hejicopters much longer. It should be noted that UFO in this case means a lighted object that could not be identified by the witnesses. The witnesses believe it was a device owned by some government on Earth. The helicopters were clearly identified as conventional military-type helicopters. The witnesses have no doubt about the observation of the helicopters. Witness Comments About the Helicopters This report will summarize the information pertaining to the helicopters reported to be involved in the total incident. The UFO will be addressed only as necessary to describe the helicopter activity. It should be noted that all initial investigations were conducted on an individual basis with each of the witnesses. Then Mrs. Landrum and Colby were interviewed together, and several months later all three. Tape Recording Made At Parkway Hospital On 1 February 1981 (Approx.), and Furnished To Bill English at APRO Betty said, after getting back into the car at the initial sighting scene, that the object went up into the sky, and \"but there was a quite a few helicopters circling around. I don't know whether they were trying to get around it or up closer to it or what, to see maybe what it was.\" Betty said, when they stopped on the Huffman-Crosby road, \"but at this time I counted 23 helicopters, around and about the object. They were far away but yet they were low enough and we set there and watched them 'till they got over the car because I wanted to make sure if it was airplanes or if it was helicopters, which it was helicopters. I counted 23 of them. I don't know what color they were, I can't say. But I do know that they had a double deal on the top, propeller-like thing. And I could hear 'em just as plain as if they were right ready to land....\" Vickie said on the same tape she counted \"20 to 25 helicopters there.\" She also said: \"the helicopters had two deals on top in place of one.\" (continued on page 4)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Cash-Landrum, Continued Betty Cash Called NASA February 16, 1981 After discharge from Parkway Hospital Betty called a number of places seeking information about the source of the helicopters seen at Huffman on December 29, 1980. She met with frustration after frustration in her attempts. Thinking NASA might 'have been flying the strange object and ,the helicopters that night, she called the NASA Public Affairs Office at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. There, she received a'courtecus, but negative response. NASA had no such object and does not operate helicopters. Howeverj the NASA representative referred Betty to John Schuessler, as the private interested party in UFO-type events. Betty Cash Called John Schuessler : Betty tried immediately to reach John Schuessler by calling his office. A record of the attempt was made, but he was'not available. She repeated the attempt until she finally reached him on 21 February 1981. At that time she related her story and the problem she 'was having finding anyone to accept responsibility for the helicopters. Kathy Gordon From Conroe Newspaper Called John Schuessler Kathy Gordon called John Schuessler on 20 February 1981 and relayed information about the incident, including a fairly detailed discussion about the helicopters. She had obtained her information by interviewing Betty Cash and Vickie Landrum. Kathy heard about the incident through the grapevine of relatives and friends of the victim's families. Betty Cash Describes The Helicopter Activity John Schuessler met Betty Cash and her mother at her brother's home . in Houston on February 22, 1981. At that time Betty described the incident, the UFO and the helicopter activity. She mentioned two different kinds of helicopters; but the one in particular she was traumatized by had two rotors on top and was large and bulky. The other was smaller, but she didn't seem to focus.much on that one. She was given no feedback on possible types of 4 helicopters that would fit her descriptions. Later, through use of the mails, Betty identified the CH-47 Chinook as the type of aircraft she had observed on December 29, 1980. She was not positive about the smaller, single rotor (helicopters. They may or may not have , been of the Bell Huey variety. Her identification was made by selecting from a variety of U.S. and foreign helicopter types. Vickie Landrum Meets Alan Holt and John Schuessler John Schuessler and Alan' Holt went to the home of Vickie Landrum in Dayton, Texas for an interview on February 28, 1981. Vickie gave a detailed account of the incident and was (questioned at length by Holt and Schuessler about the helicopter activity. She too, described two types of helicopters, but her emphasis was on the CH-47 Chinook type aircraft. She gave a verbal description and made a sketch. Later the same day, Colby Landrum was called in and introduced to Holt and Schuessler. He was told to answer any questions we asked. The boy was still quite upset by the incident and expressed fear of the helicopters. He made a crude sketch of a helicopter that was clearly of the CH-47 variety. After the interview with Colby, Vickie showed us a lightbright toy where Colby had reconstructed the scene of the event, including a double- rotor helicopter. The lightbright is a light table, covered with paper. The table contains many holes for insertion of multicolored plastic pegs. When the peg penetrates the paper sheet light comes through and illuminates the colored peg. A picture constructed in this manner is quite clear and colorful. Colby had used this technique as a sort of therapy, working out his fears and at the same time clearly explaining the frightening scene of the event. Following the in-home interviews, Vickie took Holt and Schuessler to the scene of the sighting. It was at this time that she did the first timed walk-through of the event. Fairly accurate notes on the bcation of the incident, UFO and helicopters were taken. The route was retraced and statements about the activity were recorded. A step-by-step account of the helicopter encounter was made, noting where they were first seen, where they were reengaged, counted, and last seen. The Scene Revisited The scene was revisited a number of times with Vickie, Vickie and Colby, and 1 with all three victims. Other investigators were involved also. Some were with newspapers, others with television productions. John Schuessler participated in most of these excursions. < Each time data was recorded and photographs taken. The descriptions of the helicopters and their activities were consistent. Many hours of audio recordings and transcriptions form part of the data base on the helicopter reports. Betty Cash Medical Records Copies of all of Betty Cash's medical records have been obtained and archived as part of the data base on this case. Betty has seen a great number of doctors in her quest for help. In each case, the doctors recorded a history statement as part of the medical record, starting with the Parkway Hospital records in January 1981 and following through. 1983. That historical record also identifies double rotor helicopters as being a substantial part of the incident. Others Observe CH-47 Type Helicopters Mr. John Plaster, 59 H Meyer Road, Huffman, Texas 77336 (354- 3967) and his ten-year old son were outside playing with his sop's new Christmas toys at night in late December (Christmas week) when they observed 4 or 5 Chinook \"Army\" helicopters going overhead. He is positive of the identification, but not the exact night. He said he commented at the time \"the Army has something going on tonight.\" Refer to John Schuessler's Investigator notes dated September 25, 1982. A resident of Indian Shores in Crosby, Texas, also witnessed the helicopters — a large group of military- type helicopters for 4 or 5 minutes about December 29th. He has no exact count, but said it was a large group. His name is Bill X (name on file) and is an employee of a large petrochemical (continued on page 5)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Cash-Landrum, Continued • company. He was on vacation for the week between Christmas and New Years. Lamar Walker and his wife Marie witnessed a large group of CH-47 helicopters on December 29th, in the area of the Huffman-Eastgate road. The Walkers were described as credible witnesses by the U.S. Army Inspector General's representative after an on- site investigation on May 25,1982. A full report of the Inspector General investigation is contained in John Schuessler's investigator notes dated September 5, 1982. These will not be repeated herein. CH-47 Lands in Dayton, Texas A CH-47 from Ellington Air Force Base in Houston landed in Dayton on April 30, 1981, as part of a Future Farmers Day celebration. The craft was piloted by Willy Culberson. When the aircraft flew over Dayton in preparation for landing Colby Landrum was very frightened and ran into the house in sheer fear. Vickie decided he should see the giant helicopter close up so she took him down to where it had landed and showed him it would not hurt him again. The public was invited to enter and look at the CH-47. Vickie and Colby did this and Vickie photographed the helicopter and crew. During the tour of the interior Vickie and Colby met Culberson and asked him about flying in that area previously. He referred to the December UFO event and said he and others had been called out because of the UFO and were there. When Vickie said she was one of the people hurt in that incident, Culberson beat a hasty retreat. Later, he denied via a telephone call from John Schuessler, having been involved. As a result of John Schuessler's calls to Dennis Haire, Commanding Officer of the 136th Transportation Unit at Ellington, Culberson denied having said anything of the kind. Later, he admitted to Lt. Col. Sarran, of the Army Inspector General's Office, he had made such statements, but still insisted he really wasn't there. Refer to John Schuessler's investigator notes dated September 5, 1982. General Comments This section of the report will address details of the helicopter part of the incident. The incident took place just south of the Inland Road on the Huffman-New Caney road. The roadway is lined with tall pine trees. The object came down between those pine trees during the encounter; the helicopters did not. The location is along a straight stretch of the road. Colby said he saw helicopters during the incident, part of the reason for his fear. Vickie and Betty said they saw helicopters after the UFO rose to leave the area. There is some minor disagreement whether or not one of them saw at least one helicopter earlier. After leaving the incident site, they drove approximately 3.5 miles, a portion of that distance around the fishing camp and bridge was very curvy, before intersecting FM2100, the Huffman-Crosby road. They turned right at the intersection and because the Huffman-Crosby road is very wide, they could see the UFO and helicopters ahead. Note that the flying things had flown cross country, while the victims had to follow the twists and turns of the road. Betty stopped the car near the cemetery on the right of the road and waited for the UFO and helicopters to move further away. It was at this point they first really counted the helicopters. Vickie was assuring Colby they would be all right and they would not get too close. Colby was very sure of 23 in his count, but the others said 21 to 25 in total number. They all commented how the helicopters flew. Some were up near the object like \"they were trying to hem it in,\" while others flew in a trail formation just following along, many a mile or more away. The victims expressed fear that the close in helicopters would collide. One of the very large helicopters came over the car at a very low altitude and again scared the group badly. Colby said he could see lights inside the helicopter. All the helicopters had lights on the outside. The object was like a vertical elongated light at that time, continuing to climb slowly into the night sky. It's brightess illuminated the area and the helicopters. As the group of helicopters continued to move away, Betty once again started the car and moved the 1.3 miles to the Huffman-Eastgate Road and turned left. As they drove the 2.4 miles to FM1960 they could see the flying group all the way. Note, they left the pine forest when-they entered the Huffman-Crosby road. At FM1960 they sat momentarily and watched the object growing smaller in the distance. However, they reported still seeing some helicopters coming from the direction )of Dayton. At FM1960 they turned left and sped home to Dayton and lost sight of the object out the rear window before they reached Dayton. At the scene of the original incident, all three victims were outside the car for differing periods of time. The .sounds they heard there were the constant beeping and the roar of the object that sounded like a flame thrower. The sounds were not those of helicopters. The helicopter sounds were heard only after the object flew away and at the later observation points. They did report smelling an odor like lighter fluid at the original scene. It was verified they did not have lighters with lighter fluid in their possession. John Schuessler questioned how they could see helicopters clearly in the night sky. They explained that the ones close to the UFO were clearly lit by it and the others were just visible. To verify their ability to view helicopters at night John Schuessler went out and observed CH-47 helicopters on 26 different occasions. The weather ranged from clear and hot to cold, damp, windy, and chilly. Houston, Texas air contains a lot of moisture which acts like little crystals that catch all light from the city, moon and cars and reflect it in an airglow manner that leaves the sky very light much of the time. A deep, dark night in the Houston area is unusual. John Schuessler verified that it is not difficult to see the complete detailed outline of low flying helicopters at night. To duplicate the conditions as closely as possible he observed CH-47 activity at 6:19 p.m., 6:41 p.m., and 7:19 p.m. on December 28, 1982. The helicopters were clearly visible, even though the sky was dark, technically. The. same thing was repeated on December 30,1982 at 7:05 (continued on page 6)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Cash-Landrum, Continued p.m. John Schuessler was able to photograph a CH-47 under these conditions using ASA 400 film and a Cannon camera. It is his opinion the people were able to see the helicopters on December 29, 1980, as they reported. The weather on December 29, 1980 was chilly. The witnesses reported the intermittent misty rain earlier in the day. By evening that had stopped. The clouds were high and broken and the moon was in the third quarter. The air was damp and full of moisture. The airglow of Houston was bright. The conditions were correct for being able to see helicopters flying at night. Summary John Schuessler, Alan Holt, Dave Kissinger, Don Tucker and other members of VISIT have spent two and one-half years investigating the Cash- Landrum case. During this time they worked with the representative of the Arrny Inspector General's office, a large number of newspaper and television reporters and investigators, and several lawyers. The digging into the details of the incident have involved well over 2,000 hours of work and the results have been consistent. The investigation has involved the families and friends and business associates of the victims, all with positive results. We have found no tendency towards confabulation and a total openness on the part of the victims in allowing the investigation to proceed. In conclusion, there is no reason to doubt that the victims observed helicopters, as well at the UFO. (See page 7 for A.F. response.) Another set of Investigator Notes will cover other helicopter/UFO incidents and the operational characteristics of CH-47 helicopters in a future issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. SIGHTINGS OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL PHENOMENA BY ASTRONOMERS By Adolf Schneider (West Germany) MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN,TX 78155 Summary of paper published in MUFON-CES Report No. 9 titled \"Strange Flight Objects and the unity of Physics\" (Seltsame, Flugobjekte and die Einheit der Physik), edited by Dipl.- Phys. I. Brand Since professional and amateur astronomers are considered experienced observers of the skies, it is especially necessary to question this occupational group concerning its sighting experiences. A detailed study of the historical literature shows there were always strange aerial occurrences. During the years at the threshold of the 20th century, several scientists discovered variable objects which were unexplainable as comets or meteors, and which still present a mystery today. At the end of the 40's so-called \"green fireballs\" appeared over New Mexico, which because of their unusual characteristics are considered as \"curiosities\" in meteorite research. Even Dr. Donald H. Menzel, one of the most caustic and notorious critics of \"UFO phenomena,\" had a sighting in May 1949 which he, as an astronomer, could not explain. This paper presents the reader with detailed reports of unusual sightings by numerous other astronomers, from the Fifties to 1982. After the discussion of these reports, the general chances of observing such phenomena, as well as the possibilities for deception due to psycho-physiological factors, are presented and discussed. Along with positive points of view, especially from sighting witnesses, as to the possible existence of still undiscovered natural phenomena, or even extraterrestrial influences, numerous skeptical remarks are to be found. Such commentaries — which are reproduced in entirety — are partially the result of insufficient understanding of the phenomena, as well as the expression of socio- psychologically determined communi- cations barriers. A separate section is devoted to the photographic evidence to date, as made available by astronomers. Because of the transitoriness of the phenomena, this material is understandably meagre; whereby it is likely that only a small part is known to the public. Various inquiries among astronomers show a basic willingness for cooperation in the search for unusual aerial phenomena. A prerequisite, though, would be an appropriately funded research program. The comprehensive reports, data and statistics which were compiled in this paper could be understood as a contribution toward the justification of a state or privately backed research program in the indicated direction. (Translated by Mr. W. Craig) LETTERS Dear Editor: I have noticed that skeptics such as Robert Wanderer and debunkers such as Phil Klass more than less take the approach of psychological attack. Perhaps we have not dealt with the psychological aspects of UFOlogical experience adequately. It is probably not possible to eliminate perceptual and behavioral factors from any particular case. Once adequately dealt with, I am sure that it could be demonstrated that UFOs cannot be wholly accounted for by perceptual distortions or human behavioral problems. Recordings and physical evidence are strongly against this, but these have also been subject to the complex psychology of controversy. The Persinger Theory is, at best, a limited theory with several weak points, not the least of which is why images in the perceptual field would be configured against an undistorted background (not (continued on page 14)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE WASHINGTON.

The reason for this decision is that the facts as alleged by the claimants fail to establish that their injuries were caused in any way by the United States Government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. You should not consider the acceptance and subsequent denial of this claim as an admission of the truth of any facts alleged by your clients. Our investigation has revealed no evidence of involvement by any military personnel, equipment or aircraft in this alleged incident. The arguments you presented to establish liability of the government are not supported by any case or statutory law. This is the final administrative action that can be taken on your clients' claims. This denial also satisfies the administrative filing requirements of the Federal Tort Claims Act. Based on this denial, your clients have the right to file suit against the government in an appropriate United States District Court not later than six months from the date of the mailing of this letter of denial.

In each incident, the object was hovering or moving slowly at treetop level and below. Despite both ground and aerial reconnaissance, evidence of a landing has not yet been confirmed. In the early hours of Friday, July 22, Michigan State Police trooper Dan Monroe was dispatched to a scene along Riveir'Road, where he questioned four witnesses to an anomolous vehicle. Two Consumers Power linemen who were repairing a downed electrical wire near the site had been unaware of the object's presence but may have had a bearing on ,the sequence. The witnesses, Mrs. E.E., her son J.E., together with their guests Mrs. C.H. and her daughter M.H., have requested anonymity. The E. residence is one of several newer homes in ah area west of Flint which is still basically agricultural, with crop fields and woods predominant. Beecher Road is on an. east-west landing path for Bishop International Airport. Electrical power to the E. residence had been out since 8 PM Thursday evening as a result of thunderstorm activity. When the utility truck arrived at 1 AM, the four proceeded outside to watch. A few moments later, M.H. noticed two oversized headlights just above and between two homes 100 yards to the southeast. All four estimated the lights to be about two feet in diameter and brilliant, but without the expected glaring effect and not illuminating the surroundings appreciably. As the utility truck swung into position, the driver accidentally struck the pole. Immediately, the headlights rose up slightly, then went out. Now the observers identified a domed metallic 8 disk with two or three rings of small . reddish lights and a band of gleaming metal around the central portion. The object was windowless and seemed to be silent. It started to approach the four, then turned abruptly and glided across the road toward a wooded area to the south. Once in motion, a light, low- pitched \"whirling\" was detected. As it moved away, two or more sets of metallic \"prongs\" (inverted v-shaped rods) were seen extending from underneath. Above or just beyond the woods, the vehicle made a slow vertical descent out of sight. With their attention on positioning the truck, the utility employees had failed to notice its presence. The witnesses continued to watch for an hour but to no avail. The truck experienced no disruption of lights or engine. As electrical power was off at the E. residence, no disturbances were noted. However, the Coyne family, a quarter mile to the southeast, related a popping sound on both their television and smoke detector at about the same time. The Coynes' subsequent sightings are explained below. The E. family dog began pacing, barking and looking out windows shortly before the incident. Afterward, it was hiding in the basement after failing to answer its owner's calls. The woods and cornfield beyond were thoroughly searched, but no landing trace could be located. Several other neighbors, all of whom were asleep at the time, could offer nothing substantial. It is noteworthy that the thunderstorms had reduced Bishop International Airport to emergency power and knocked out the north- south runway lights, leaving only the east-west path available. The FAA raw radar system at Bishop was shut down at 11 PM as scheduled. ' George and Shirley Coyne learned of the first incident from a relative of Mrs. E. who works with Shirley. Though unacquainted with the E. family, the Coynes had a long interest in aerial phenomena. Nineteen nights after the initial sighting, at 1:10 AM, August 10, the Coynes spotted the object from the motor home in their driveway, where they had been sleeping during warm summer nights. Shirley was smoking a final cigarette and watching for deer from the rear window, with George asleep next to her. Suddenly, oversized headlights rose over a line of trees some 600 feet away. She, quickly woke her husband, and the two observed the lights hover momentarily just above the windbreak, brilliant but nonglaring and only dimly shining on the trees below. The lights began a slow descent across the undeveloped field. Shirley could detect a partial outline of the upper portion, a dome reflecting reddish-pink light of undetermined source. Newly awakened, George could not confirm a definite outline. The vehicle continued eastward at jogging speed until it passed behind their garage, blocking their vision. They leaped into robes and raced out, but the object was nowhere to be found. Ten nights later, August 19, Shirley sighted the anomoly again along with her cousin Marion Hillaker, who with her husband John were visiting from Texas for the weekend. The women were sitting on the rear patio when the pinkish reflection appeared at nearly the same point, perhaps 700 feet distant over the treeline and motionless. This light source was then extinguished, replaced by a single white light which slowly approached the house. The women began running toward it. Shirley hollered that they should alert their husbands and they halted. Before Marion could turn around, a second white light came on next to the first, the (continued on page 9)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Domed Disk, Continued lights/object turned northward, \"and shot away from us back toward the woods.\" By this time, the men had heard the disturbance and came outside in time to see the lights, a mile or more away by now, moving low into the distance. Checking her watch, Shirley noted that it was 11:20 PM. Three nights later, Shirley sat at her bedroom window, scanning the surroundings. With two observations of their own plus the E. sighting, she was anxious to view it more distinctly. George stirred awake at 1:30 AM and they talked for a while. A crunching sound alerted them that a car had missed the nearby curve, so George donned his robe and went to the scene. He returned shortly with the young driver, who explained that he had fallen asleep at the wheel. They called his parents and police and attended to his minor injuries. By 2 AM, fire and police crews had arrived. George returned to the site while Shirley waited on the porch. \"I do not know how I knew the UFO was there,\" Shirley related later, \"but I suddenly knew that it was. I turned my head and looked toward the southeast. There it was, sitting very still. It appeared to be about 75 feet from the ground and 100 to 150 feet from where I stood on the porch....The whole craft was reflecting red lights from the emergency equipment.\" She described a silent, metallic vehicle shaped \"like two pie plates fitted together\", its diameter the length of a semi-trailer. Two protrusions were noted on the underside, likened to the inverted, v-shaped prongs seen by the E. and H. families. An appendage of some sort was thought to be atop the dome. The police and ambulance lights pulsated against the side of the craft. Though within veiw of the persons at the accident site, none realized its presence. Shirley jumped from the porch to alert George, but as she did, the object moved off quickly to the south above the treetops and out of sight. It was now 2:15 AM. A month passed before the fifth incident occurred at 1:10 AM, September 23. Meanwhile, the Coynes had joined MUFON and notified several neighbors of the anomolous visits. They were returning from mixed doubles league bowling and a team meeting which followed. As they neared the E. residence from the northwest, Shirley spotted an object just above an open field to the northeast. George confirmed this fact, but was unable to take his attention from the road long enough to see an outline. To Shirley, this bright metallic vehicle was seemingly oval shaped, the length of a boxcar and about 15 feet in height. Two white lights on the near side, they agreed, were horizontal and bar- shaped, aimed angularly toward the ground. No other lights were present. As the object headed south, George slowed the car, hoping to intersect it over the road. Instead, the vehicle made a sharp turn to the southeast without changing its attitude or direction of the lights. \"I kept thinking to myself and I remember remarking to George, Why did it not turn, why is it flying sideways?\" It passed over the high-tension power lines bordering the E. property and continued behind the line of homes, pacing the Coyne auto. They saw it descend slowly over undeveloped fields, catching glimpses of it between the houses. With their windows rolled up, they heard no sound. The car exhibited no operating problems, while the radio was turned off throughout. Just as they reached their residence, the object descended out of sight. \"We drove right past our house and into the parking lot of a church,\" Shirley recalls. \"We waited 15 minutes or so but did not see anything, so we drove home.\" After doing some latenight chores in preparation for a weekend trip, they retired for the night. Shirley decided to look out a window about 2 AM and spotted the lights across and down the road to the northeast. They ran ( outside, observing it moving farther off to the east and out of sight. Analysis The five sightings involved eight witnesses in total, six of them adults. All but one of the incidents were multiple- witness events. And, aside from their obvious veracity during followup interviews, the E. and H. families were not acquainted with the Coynes and Hillakers. Mrs. H. and the children drew the object as a flat-based dome disk, while Mrs. E. and Shirley Coyne described \"inverted pie plates\". Mrs. H. was not (continued on page 10) 1. The E. Residence 2. The Coyne Residence"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Domed Disk, Continued wearing her prescription glasses (for astygmatism) at the time, while George Coyne and John Hillaker, due to .unfortunate timing, could not ascribe an outline with certainty. Given the repetition of the Coynes' observations and agreement with the sketch by Mrs. E., the author concludes, that a windowless disk of identical upper and lower hemispheres was seen. Common features mentioned in the first four events are a shiny metallic exterior; oversized white lights, bright but neither glaring nor greatly illuminating; some sort of reddish light source reflecting on the surface; a band around the vehicle's girth; : and metallic, inverted v-shaped appendages underneath, also bright metallic. No disagreements arose in terms of the vehicle's marieuverings or duration of each episode. Other than Shirley's possible sensory realization in the fourth incident and the nervous behavior of the E.'s dog in the first, no unusual psychological or physiological reactions were reported. One feature in the first sighting divergent from those subsequent is the element of sound. The E. and H. witnesses heard a light \"whirling\", pulsating and high-pitched, audible only when the object was in motion nearby. 1 In the fourth event, Shirley stood within 150 feet of the motionless disk, certain of its silence. She was jumping from the porch when it moved away, but nonetheless recalls no sound. In the final episode, Shirley states, a separate vehicle appeared, ovular and larger/Though George's attention was to his driving, he two saw white lights stretched across the object, pointing angularly down, and saw that they did not turn when the . vehicle changed direction. When seen again later that night, the lights were too distant to ascertain an outline. Assigning purpose to the visits is problematic. In the general vicinity are the Flint River, a small lake arid pond, high-tension power lines, and a water tower. Consumers Power Company 'recorded neither a power surge nor drainage during the period, while Flint Township officials indicate that an absence of rain caused the water 10 pressure in the tower to remain low throughout the time in question. The area lies along a landing pattern of a busy airport, and all observations were made at an hour when its raw radar system was not in use. While no particular episode affords a clear purpose, it is noteworthy that two of the incidents occurred during emergency conditions — a power outage and an accident scene. On all five occasions and at all times, the object(s) remained within 100 feet of the ground, and three times it was thought to be preparing to land. Sqil samples have been taken from a site along its path on the final night for lab evaluation. Robert V. Pratt Becomes New Editor Securing an eminently qualified replacement for Richard Hall; as Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, was no small task, since Dick ranks as one of the finest UFO writers in North America. Mr. Hall's administrative assignments, while associated with NICAP, gave him first-hand experience in managing a volunteer UFO organization. Both of these attributes were assets to him in elevating the stature of our Journal as a monthly UFO publication. Joining MUFON in 1976, Bob Pratt brings thirty-one years of experience as a journalist to bear upon the continued quality improvement of the Journal. He worked as an editor and reporter on daily newspapers in Virginia, Indiana, Buffalo, Miami, Philadelphia, and Louisville for 21 years before becoming a writer and reporter for the National Enquirer. As a reporter for the Enquirer, he first became interested in UFOs in early 1975 and went on to specialize in UFO reporting. Bob has personally investigated several hundred UFO cases in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Mexico, the Philippines and Japan, interviewing about 1300 people who have had UFO experiences. He has written a book, as yet unpublished, about his experiences and is currently working on two more books with UFO themes, one a novel and the other a book about the Cash-Landrum case. He is presently employed as a layout editor on another magazine based in West Palm Beach, Florida. As a UFO investigative reporter, editor, and writer, Mr. Pratt has exhibited the eminence and expertise to make him ideally suited for this important assignment. As Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, . Bob automatically becomes a member of the MUFON Board of Directors. Through his outstanding, thorough arid concien- cious UFO investigations/Mr. Pratt has earned the respect of those of us in Ufology and the UFO community. He is approaching his new responsibility with a high degree of enthusiasm and great expectations. Since joining MUFON, Bob has attended the majority of the MUFON Annual UFO symposiums, so he is personally acquainted with many of our members. He and his family reside at 4623 Holly Lake Drive, Lake Worth, Florida 33463: All articles that are submitted for consideration and possible publication in the Journal will continue to be mailed to MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, Texas 78155 U.S.A.

For many months I have resisted speaking out on this issue, hoping that it would simply fade into the oblivion it so richly deserves. But as that apparently is not the case, I have decided to present the negate side of the evidence. Veteran investigator Ann Druffel and I belong to a study group in the Los Angeles area that meets on a monthly basis. Ann asked the group for assistance in evaluating the Bailey photos, and I volunteered my services, partly because of my general background in optics, and partly because I found the case to be so bizarre. Over a period of several months, I had an opportunity to handle the actual photos, meet Reverend Bailey, conduct experiments with the camera of the type involved, and do a mathematical analysis of shadows on the \"full light\" photos. I certainly agree with Ann that these photos.constitute \"unique physical evidence\"! Evidence that I believe substantiates a hoax. Reverend Bailey alleges that the \"full light\" photos, showing two Halloween masks with \"appendages\" dangling underneath — the purported 'entities' — were taken without a flash. And yet, a light source was obviously required to make these photos. Rather than allow this fact to threaten the credibility of her witness, Ann concluded that \"the light source must be paranormal\"! I pointed out to Ann .that numerous tale-tale shadows in these photos indicate that the light came from a point source near the lens of the camera. A light source to the left of the camera .would clearly cast ,a shadow to the right of the object. The closer the source to the lens axis, the smaller the shadow. Not convinced by my qualitative argument, Ann requested that I demonstrate the point mathematically. This I did, and I have provided a copy of my derivation of the \"shadow function\" Fs to the editor. If d is the distance between camera lens and background (in this case a wall), b the distance between object and background, and s the distance from the lens axis to a light source (such as a flashbulb) in the same plane as the lens, then the apparent displacement of the shadow (on the background) from the object is: ' ' Fs=_ b J_ d-b That this formute is reasonable is easily shown. A flat object (such as a coin) between camera and wall, with the source off, say, to the left, will cast a shadow to the right. But as the distance between coin and background (b) diminishes, so does the displacement (Fs) between the center of the coin and the center of its shadow. When the coin is placed on the background, b=o and Fs=o. That is, the coin's shadow is completely behind the coin and cannot be seen. If the coin is left some distance b from the background, and the camera moved away from the background, the apparent displacement between shadow and object centers would decrease as the distance d increased. At d=°o, there would be no shadow. Finally it can be shown that the closer the source is to the lens, the smaller the Fs. In the impractical case that the lens and source should coincide (s=o), Fs is O and again no shadow can be seen since it is completely behind the object. Figure 1 is an attempt on miy part to duplicate one of the many \"full light\" BAILEY photos. The photo was taken with a Polaroid One-Step camera exactly like the one used by Reverend Bailey. The flashbar on this camera is mounted directly over the lens. The first flashlamp to fire is on the bar's extreme left. The next photo uses the flashlamp to the right of it, and so on. Thus the light source moves from far upper left to far upper right. One would expect then, that the shadows on succeeding photos would progress from being below and to the right to being below and to the left of an object. Such was indeed the case. Figure 1 was the 5th photo taken, when the flash on my camera would have been above and to the right of the lens. Please notice that the shadow of the vertical stick on the table is below and to the left, as it should be. If one looks closely at the left hand side of the \"appendages\" one can also see a similar shadow, although it is quite close to the fabric. This is predicted by the formula for Fs, since the distance between object (the fabric) and its background (the light colored wood immediately underneath the table) is small. Figure 2 is one of the Bailey \"full light\" photos. Notice the crumpled paper sack sitting on the bookcase to the right. It's shadow is cast below and to its left, indicating a light source above and to the right of the camera lens! Its position, in fact, tells us the order in which the \"full light\" photos were taken. This photo was number 5! With even rough estimates of the distances d, b, and s, one can calculate the approximate lengths of the shadows in Figure 2. All are consistent with the light source being immediately to the right and above the lens. Could it really be a coincidence that the hypothesized \"paranormal\" light source should coincide with a flashbar? With regard to the composition of the \"appendages\", Ann claimed that she knew of no way of fabricating the \"legs\". Rather, she felt, the material resembled the ectoplasm shown oozing from the noses or mouths of psychics in certain books on the paranormal: In my first attempt to duplicate the \"full light\" photos, I hung white nurse's stockings below the Halloween masks. At that point, all I had to go on was the photo as reproduced in the Journal, (continued on page 12) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Bailey Case, Continued Figure 1. Thomas Photograph Figure 2. Bailey Photograph Distance from camera: To Wall - 8 ft. To Pole - 5 ft. To Mask - 4 ft. and when compared to the actual Bailey photos, they were found lacking. But my second attempt to duplicate the photos with the Polaroid One-Step (the first experiments were ran with a Polaroid Square Shooter 2) were far more successful. The \"appendages\" in Figure 1 were fashioned out of a long sleeved tee shirt I used when skiing. I do not know how well Figure 1 and 2 will reproduce in the Journal, but I can assure you that there is virtually no difference in the color and texture of the \"limbs\". My own examination of both polaroids indicates a high probability that they are made of white cotton fabric, possibly \"Fruit of the Loom\"! Reverend Bailey alleges that one of the \"entities\" jumped from the table and fled to the bathroom door, as did the other moments later. Several of the photographs which Bailey took (after he apparently ran out of flashlamps) are alleged by Ann to show humanoids, for example, standing in the bathroom doorway. What particularly disturbs me at this point is, that after examining both the original photos and slides of those photos, I can assure the reader rhat....f/iere are no humanoids! What is 12 a \"humanoid\" shape anyway? Is a starfish, photographed out of focus, to be considered a humanoid spread- eagled? None of the vague blurred images on those Bailey photos alleged to show humanoids has a form even remotely identifiable with that of a man, woman, child, higher primate, or for that matter, any animal! In the course of my examination of the Bailey photos, I found that many rather prosaic phenomena captured on the film became somehow mysticized. For example, a diffused reflection of the flashlamp appears on the bathroom wall in one of the \"full light\" photos. This type of reflection is quite common, particularly from walls that have been painted with a roller. Somehow this became a \"ball of light\". Multiple exposures on some of the photos taken without benefit of a light source, \"paranormal\" or otherwise, were considered \"mysterious\" since it was impossible to take double exposures with a One-Step. Yet for indoor photos, taken at night without flash, crude double exposures can be made. This is because the camera electronics tries to hold the shutter open until enough light has entered the camera to make a properly exposed photo. A camera jerked about during this time will show multiple images before a time-out function closes the shutter. An example of this tendency toward mystification revolved around the number of times Bailey changed film packs. According to his narrative, after taking his first two photos, he put a new pack of film into the camera, from which he claims to have taken all of the succeeding photos. Those photo- graphs come to 14! Yet, the PolaPak contains ony 10 photographs! The pack I used in my One Step only had 10 photos, and I was assured by local photo shops and by the manufacturer that there never was a film pack made for that camera that held more than 10 photos. This discrepancy however, far from calling into question Reverend Bailey's credibility, simply became another 'mystery', adding no doubt to the 'strangeness' of the case. So what is the bottom line? Reverend Bailey has perpetuated a HOAX! The case could be made that a confused man with a history of sleepwalking mistakenly took photos of what he thought were extraterres- trials. But I submit that no one in such a somnambulistic state would load a camera and take photos of two propped-up Halloween masks with \"legs\" placed in different poses! It is a hoax. Now the question may arise as to (continued on page 13)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Bailey Case, Continued how an experienced investigator, with over 28 years in Ufology, could have been taken in by such a crude hoax. I think Ann made a number of egregious errors, and that a discussion of those errors is of benefit to Ufology. First, there was a general disregard for physical data. The \"full light\" photos offer incontrovertible physical evidence that a flashbar provided the illumination. If Reverend Bailey says he didn't use a flash, but the photographs say otherwise, who wins? The photographs do, hands down. Second, this case shows how tr.uely damaging some of the paranormal theories can be. I do not deny that parapsychological phemonena exists, nor that they may have some relevance to the UFO phenomenon. Yet, in the Bailey case, paranormal forces were invoked to negate hard physical data. I think it is dangerous to allow one's belief in such shadowy areas as parapsychology to become so deep that it interferes with one's perception of reality. And third, I think an investigator should avoid becoming too involved with a percipient, real or otherwise. I believe that in such cases a symbiotic relationship arises as both lend psychological support for the other's contentions. It makes it difficult for the investigator to cope with evidence that might indicate fraud or hoax. Finaljy, I believe that cases such as that of Reverend Bailey can only serve to lower Ufology's standards. I petition the editor not to publish future material on the Bailey case unless the investigator can prove, for example, that the light source for the \"full light\" photos were not taken with a flashlamp, or that the \"appendages\" were truely made of exotic material.

Box 58485, Houston, Texas 77258-8485 Witness: Robert Pickins, 9707 So. Gessener, Houston (southwest) Sighting time and location: The sighting was made from the Pizza Hut on the corner of Bissonet and South Gessener, at 11:52 a.m., Wednesday, September 21, 1983. Summary of incident: Mr. Pickens is an orderly at St. Luke's Hospital, where he works the graveyard shift. He is usually off work and home (Apartment 1509) by 8:30 to 9:00 a.m., Monday thru Friday. He watches television, has lunch and then goes to bed. The Pizza Hut is very near his apartment, so he walked over, ordered a pizza, played a video game, and then sat waiting for his order to be prepared. He claims to hold a commercial pilot rating as well as instructor rating. As he sat looking at the church and trees across the street, he noticed the glint of sun on something apparently metallic. He said the thing was making a nearly vertical ascent (approx. 80 degrees), while twisting on its axis. It went up to 2000 to 3000 feet in altitude, then came back down to about 1000 feet, made a sweeping turn to the south and went behind some trees. When it emerged from behind the trees, it turned west along Bissonet and was soon lost from sight. He believed it was five miles distant. Almost immediately a Jet Ranger 206 helicopter came from the east northeast at a somewhat higher altitude and followed the same path as the object, coming down from the higher altitude. The helicopter disappeared in the same direction. All his observations were based on his experience as a pilot. Mr. Pickens called Ellington Air Force Base, The Federal Information Center, and NASA. NASA referred him to Bob Gribble. Weather: Sky was clear. No clouds. A front had come through a day earlier, clearing out all moisture, inversions, etc. Temperature was in the lower 70s. This was the first period of nearly perfect weather since spring 1983.

Summary of Incident: Ms. Stafford was in the kitchen cooking an omelet. Michael Stafford was on the sofa. He heard a strange noise (described as like flying saucers make when portrayed on television). He reacted, fearing something in the kitchen had . malfunctioned. He called to Kathy, but she stood transfixed, looking out the kitchen window to the east. He repeated his question about the noise several times before she answered him. Then ,she described a huge object, which she claimed was hovering over the powerlines just outside their property. She said the object was like two paper plates, joined rim to rim. The edges were blunt. A series of globes or holes ringed the object, all of different colors (red, green, blue, whitish yellow). She said the thing glowed. The noise had caused her to look out the window. The noise lasted for 15 to 20 seconds, but the object stayed in view longer, be- fore blinking out. She said it was above the telephone pole in- the northeast corner of the yard. The pole is about 40 feet high. The object filled nearly her whole field of vision out the window. Michael estimated that to be about the size of a football field. Their dog \"barked like hell\" and carried on for the next hour like someone was outside. At my suggestion, Michael went next door and checked with their neighbor to see if she had seen anything. She claimed seeing a similar object, only slightly earlier, and over the adjacent subdivision. Her name was Ruby Taylor. Weather: The weather was nearly perfect. The air was clear and the moon was full. Temperature was about 50 degrees. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(The following letter was sent to CSICOP for possible publication in their journal, The Skeptical Inquirer. In case it is not published, we want to share its contents with our readers. The Editor The Skeptical Inquirer 3025 Palo Alto Drive N.E. Albuquerque, N.M. 87111 Dear Sir: As a subscriber to and an avid reader of The Skeptical Inquirer, one who always looks forward to the next edition, I would like to register a demurrer or two. I wonder sometimes about your objectivity; that one thing you claim to cherish and to practice above everything else. I wonder if your attitude is: we know this belief system cannot be true, therefore we must prove it isn't; instead of, we don't know whether this is true, but let's try to find out. I'm thinking particularly of one of your favorite whipping posts: UFOs. I'm writing as both a clergyman and a ufqlogist. You probably don't have too many of those in the ranks of your subscribers, and especially people who claim to wear both hats! In case you think I'm slumming you should know that I didn't get into UFOs because I had nothing else to do; that, in order to fight boredom, I decided to move into the realm of fantasy. Neither did I get into UFOs because, as a clergyman, I must be a simple-minded supernaturalist. I got into the whole area because, as a rationalist in all things including science and religion, I was confronted with a phenomenon which demanded my serious attention. Your views notwithstanding, there is abundant and powerful UFO evidence, and it compelled me to act. Something unexplainable by normal categories was happening all over the world, and as a \"skeptical inquirer\" in my own right I felt the need to get involved. I agree that seeing something strange in the sky can be either illusion or hallucination. My two degrees in psychology have taught me that that is quite possible. (You could never convince the people I have interviewed about their UFO sightings that that was the explanation, however. Many of these people are about as educated, 14 rational and professional as people can be, and they know they witnessed something.) Also, I suppose the reported \"abduction\" cases could have some sort of valid psychological explanation. (All of them?) But the cases that Allen Hynek calls Close Encounters of the Second Kind (CE- IIs), where investigators have found tangible, physical evidence of something strange and unusual, I believe require more attention and research than CSICOP would seem to have time for. When someone says that he saw a gigantic, circular craft descend from the sky and settle in a meadow, we could say that that person was obviously suffering from either an illusion or a hallucination. But when the \"craft\" leaves the scene and our subject walks over to the site and sees tripod imprints, swirled grass and crushed rocks, burning branches and bushes, he begins then to believe what his senses have told him. He begins to say to himself: I didn't imagine this; something of a physical, tangible, empirical sort just took place in my presence. So forget for a moment all the sightings and alleged abductions. The battle goes on endlessly as to whether these are valid and \"real\" or merely someone's vain imaginings. Just look for one objective moment at the physical trace evidence. It is here that I, for one, feel that ufology must ultimately take its stand. These \"hard evidence\" manifestations demand and cry out for an explanation, but CSICOP cannot be bothered. CSICOP cannot lower itself enough to research them. It would be unseemly and entirely beneath them, for they couldn't stand to be tainted by the forces of superstition and darkness. They wouldn't want even to appear to lend any credibility to such foolishness by showing active interest. That's because CSICOP is \"scientific.\" Right? Here all along I had been led to believe that it was the theologians, seers, soothsayers and charlatans who were the blind obscurantists. But no. CSICOP in its headlong plunge toward its own narrow, private brand of \"objectivity\" cannot take time to examine evidence which then must be left by default as the sole domain of the only ones who will: the avocational, unpaid, but oftentimes highly educated and certainly dedicated UFO investigators who keep their own chronicles while talking mainly to each other and occasionally to those outside their circle who seem genuinely interested in what they have discovered. Most ufologists I know have their opinions on this subject, to be sure. Most seem to endorse the extraterrestrial hypothesis, as a matter of fact. But most are much more open on the whole question than you would ever guess. They too like to think of themselves as \"skeptical inquirers\" attempting to get at the truth, whatever the truth may be. At least they work at it. Why doesn't CSICOP work at it as well? Very sincerely yours, Jack A. Jennings (The Rev.) Montana State Director Mutual UFO Network LETTERS (Continued from page 6) characteristic of your standard variety hallucination). So, could we have an article in psychological defense or something along the line as to why some UFOs could be alien artifacts? One more point please while I am up to letter writing. It is amazing to me that after 25 years I can still be reading some of the same arguments against ETH. The speed-of-light barrier is glibly invoked by even the learned as a formidable opponent to space travel. The interpretations by pro-relativists and anti-relativists leave plenty of room for doubt on the subject of the speed-of- light. And where is the imagination? Einstein said it was more precious than knowledge (doctrine). How about Holt's hyperspace jumper? There may not be only other planets in our universe that serve as habitats for ETs, but other worlds in other universes, dimensions, or time zones. So I would like to see articles on UFO-related speculative science, articles that will fire the imagination. Sincerely, William F. Hamilton ID 6221 W.

Recognizing that it has taken thirty-five years to reach this particular goal, there are a few critical people who can't understand why all of the goals proposed by the new federation haven't been accomplished in the first three months of its existence. Such demands are so absurd that they do not justify an answer at this point in time. An issue that does require our immediate attention is the establishment of an annual budget and the means of financing the administration of NAUpOF and the projects proposed. The second of two budgets for July 1, 1983 to June 1984 was submitted to the Board of Directors on October 12, 1983 for approval by Richard F. Haines, Director. It has been revised to include only items that are essential for the operation of the organization during its first year, therefore it is anticipated that the revised budget will be approved by the Board of Directors. Several suggestions and proposals have been made for financing NAUFOF. We would like to share these with our membership, since our members are in reality the Mutual UFO Network, not just our Board of Directors. MUFON, as a participating member organization, has a financial obligation to support the North American UFO Federation. One of the proposed methods of financing NAUFOF would be based upon the number of dues paying members in each member organization on a prorated basis. If MUFON was financially able to simply prepare a check for one or two dollars per member for the first year and larger amounts in subsequent years this would be a feasible arrangement, however this is not possible., Our present dues structure only covers the cost of publishing the MUFON UFO Journal and postage. Another proposal suggested involves assessing each member a prescribed amount each year as •MUFON's contribution to.the'financial support of NAUFOF. A variation to this plan could be increasing the annual dues structure to compensate for these additional costs. Since MUFON is recognized as a tax-exempt organization, gifts or donations to the Mutual UFO Network, could be designated specifically for this purpose as another alternative. Assessment of each member without their prior approval would not be a popular method. If the annual dues structure was increased we would want all of our members to be aware of the specific reasons beforehand. Since MUFON is just one of the member organizations in NAUFOF, we are cognizant that a considerable number of our members are also members of CUFOS, SBI, Fund for UFO Research, etc., which would result in duplications of assessments if this route was selected. An increase in dues structure is a fair method, however it might discourage people from subscribing to several different organization's publications, since all would have to increase their annual subscriptions proportionately. A prorated method based upon membership sounds reasonable. This means that MUFON and CUFOS, the two largest member organizations; would be providing the majority of the financial support to NAUFOF., MUFON and SBI have been the leaders in promoting such an organization. As a contribution, MUFON financed the original organizational meeting in Toronto, Ontario in 1982 and was prepared to do the same in 1983, because of our faith in the need for such a cooperative and dedicated organization as the North American UFO Federation. The MUFON Board of Directors is soliciting your ideas, suggestions, and proposals for providing financial support to the operation of NAUFOF. Without the backing of organizations like MUFON, it is doomed to failure in its infancy.

' UFO QUESTIONNAIRE REPORT An official MUFON project at the Pasadena, California, MUFON 1983 UFO Symposium was the distribution of a questionnaire that was designed by Jim McCampbell, MUFON Director of Research. The same questionnaire was inserted into the June issue of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL and many responses have begun to come in. We owe a great debt to the patience of International Director, Walt Andrus, ,and his wife, Jeanne, for that tedious task. Of the 240 people attending the '83 Symposium, 59 filled out the questionnaire. An analysis of the responses was completed within two weeks, resulting in a 42-page report. It covers such subjects as the respondent's age, sex, educational background, commitment to ideas, knowledge of UFOs, opinions on all the questions, and the number of UFOs .that have been observed by them and their friends. The findings are quite revealing. Copies of the report, entitled \"Opinion Survey of UFOlogy,\" are available from the author for $4.00 plus $1.00 for handling and postage.

On August 7th a meeting was held in the home of Mrs. Jean Waller, State Director for Oklahoma, in Norman with a press conference on the following morning. New members were obtained in Tulsa during a brief visit, however no formal meeting was conducted. A syndicated Cox News Service release by Joe Vargo appeared in local newspapers prior to each of my visits resulting in very favorable publicity for MUFON. Walt met with a small group of interested people at the Holiday Inn in Marion, Illinois and followed this by meeting with Francis Ridge, State Section Director, and his team of field investigators in Mt. Vernon, Indiana. Two radio interviews on stations KMOX Radio \"Open Line\" in St. Louis, Missouri and WILY in Centralia, Illinois were utilized as public relations announcements for the Field Investigator's Training Meeting and Annual UFO Picnic, both sponsored by the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis for the weekend of August 20th and 21st. R. Powell Adams served as public relations chairman for both of these very successful UFO events in the St. Louis area. The Field Investigator's Training Course was held at the Grand Glaize Library in St. Louis County on Saturday, August 20th and at the Farm and Home Savings and Loan Association conference room on Sunday morning in Des Peres, Missouri. The Co-chairpersons for this very professionally conducted training course were Mrs. Marjorie Sherrill and Jeffrey L. Kretsch. Other instructors who participated were Chuck Adams, Chief Investigator for the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis and Walt Andrus. Mr. Kretsch is the new president of the St. Louis group 16 Left to right: Marjorie Sherrill and Jeffrey L. Kretsch succeeding Mrs. Irene Alexander. A test was administered to the entire class and Field Investigator status was awarded to those receiving a passing grade. Many of these people immediately joined MUFON and will become actively involved. Commenda- tions and recognition must be bestowed upon Marjorie and Jeff for their outstanding work and diligent preparations. The Annual Picnic sponsored by the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, and chaired by John Schroeder, State Section Director, was held Sunday, August 21st at Love Park in St. Louis County. The family picnic was blessed with an unusual amount of delicious food for everyone to enjoy. Walt Andrus, the featured speaker, became nostalgic by briefly relating to previous annual picnics, starting in 1968, at the home of John and Kathy Schuessler in O'Fallon, Missouri. Rosetta and Dick Holmes were the gracious hosts for ten consecutive years held at the Carlyle Lake Reservoir in Carlyle, Illinois. Since MUFON was organized in the midwestem states with St. Louis and Quincy, Illinois as the hub, founding members of MUFON attending the annual picnic this year were recognized. They are Joe Gurney, Cliff Palmberg, John Schroeder, and Rosetta and Dick Holmes. Many others became involved immediately after MUFON was founded. The St. Louis group was host to the MUFON 1971 UFO Conference at the Holiday Inn. In his speech, Walt Andrus cited the Delphos, Kansas landing trace case of November 2, 1971 as one of the most important cases, since soil samples disclosed significant changes that could provide clues to the power plant of the object observed in the sheep lot by Ronnie Johnson. On Sunday evening, Walt and his wife met for a few hours with Dr. and Mrs. Harley Rutledge in Cape Girardeau, Missouri just prior to Dr. (continued on page 17)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Midwest Visits, Continued Rutledge's departure for England to speak at the United Kingdom 3rd International UFO Congress held in Buckinghamshire on August 27,28 and 29. On the following morning, an enjoyable visit over coffee was held with Edward F. O'Herin, State Section Director for southeast Missouri, in New Madrid, Missouri. On August 22nd, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Oswald were the hosts for a meeting and lecture in their home in Memphis, Tennessee for the Memphis Aerial Phenomenon Society (MAPS); Richard A. Rotter, President and MUFON State Section Director. Your Director presented a slide/illustrated lecture on Close Encounters of the Second and Third Kinds, which was well received by the enthusiastic audience. We hope that this meeting was an inspiration to expand the investigative team in the Shelby County area. The Memphis Appeal newspaper cooperated by publishing the very favorable Cox News Service release a few days before the meeting. While driving from Memphis, to Fayetteville, Arkansas, we stopped in Plumerville, Arkansas for an enjoyable and productive visit with Lou Parish, a member of the MUFON UFO Journal Staff and Co-Editor of the UFO News Clipping Service. Mildred and Ed Higgins were the gracious hosts for the Arkansas Mini-UFO Conference and Picnic at their mountain-top home, \"Starsong\" in Fayetteville. William D. Leet, State Director, led a contingent from the Texarkana locality to the \"Arky Army\" picnic. The meeting was well represented by people from northwest Arkansas, including Ed O'Herin from New Madrid, Missouri. During the evening program, Walt Andrus presented the same slide lecture that he gave in Memphis the previous night. State Section Directors attending were Mildred Higgins, and Paul Rutherford. Norma E. Lindblad, Pjublic Relations Director for Arkansas, arranged for an interview by Robert Kerr of the Texarkana Gazette and two appearances on their TV station covering a four state area for the MUFON Director during his visit on Left to right: Rev. G. IMeal Hern, State Director for Texas; Mrs. IM. Jean Waller, State Director for Oklahoma. August 25th. Bill and Helen Leet displayed their hospitality while we were visiting in Texarkana.

It was a privilege to share our interest in Ufology with all of you as another means of organizing strong and competent UFO investigative teams in each community. In the future we hope to utilize this personal contact method of meeting with our MUFON members, whenever possible.

We are entertaining bids for hosting future UFO symposiums for 1986, 1987, etc. The MUFON 1983 Symposium Proceedings are now available from MUFON for $10.00 plus $1.50 for postage and handling in U.S. funds. The theme is \"UFOs: A Scientific Challenge.\" The following published papers are included: \"A Review of Selected Aerial Phenomenon from Aircraft from 1942 to 1952\" by Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., \"UFO Interference with Vehicles and Self-Starting Engines\" by James M. McCampbell, \"Southern California's Straight-Line Mystery in UFO Sightings\" by Ann Druffel, \"UFOs: Uncovering the Ultimate Answer\" by William L.

Andrus Jr., \"The Case Against E.T.\" by J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D., \"UFO Propulsion: Pulsed Radiation and Crystalline- Structure\" by Alan C. Holt, and \"The Continuing UFO Deception and Confusion Syndrome\" by Paul C. Cerny. The North American UFO Federation (NAUFOF) progress has been relatively slow during the summer vacation period, however Newsletter Number One, dated October 4, 1983 prepared by Pete Mazzola the Secretary, is bound to revitalize the Board Members. Pete has taken the prerogative of itemizing the proposals made by the Director, Richard F. Haines, Ph.D.; Secretary, Pete Mazzola; Charles J. Wilhelm, Board Member; and Proposal #8 by Ron Schaffner and cited further questions that could invoke further action. Pete is to be commended for taking this positive action. As a Board Member, I recommend that the Newsletters should be continued as a communication aid. Richard C. Niemtzow, M.D. (Capt. USAF) has been transferred from Travis AFB in California to Andrews AFB in Maryland. He has advised that correspondence concerning \"Project UFO MD\" should now be addressed to him at 1111 Boston Road, Andrews AFB, Maryland 20335 U.S.A. His new 18 telephone number is (301) 599-8957. A short article in the publication Federal Times dated 9/12/83 may make it more difficult to obtain vital UFO information from government agencies. The following paragraph is a direct quote: 2. In a few weeks, 2500 U.S. Justice Department employees will receive and sign a 5-page form that will commit them perpetually to government censorship. This is in accordance with President Reagan's March 11 directive on government secrecy. Next, up to 200,000 people working in other areas of the government may face a lifetime of censorship. Senator Don Edwards (D-California) regards the regulations as \"radically authoritarian,\" preventing thousands of Americans \"from any discussion whatever about what might be important public questions.\" This is a definite clue that obtaining documents through a Freedoms of Information Request (5 U.S.C., Section 552) may present greater obstacles. And speaking of obstacles, we may not be subjected to further volumes of the picture books \"UFO...Contact From the Pleides\" by Wendelle C. Stevens and associates. The MUFON UFO Journal has been very critical of the Billy Meier hoax that Mr. Stevens and associates have thrust upon the public. His credibility is being further questioned by recent developments. We have had in our possession for several months the official court documents from Pima County, Arizona on his conviction for child molestation, furnishing obscene items to minors, and engaging in sexual misconduct with minors. He is now incarcerated in an Arizona prison. Prior to this time your Director had refrained from publishing the information on his conviction and incarceration. However, Wendelle Castyle Stevens is now spreading the word that he was \"framed\" and that the . C.I.A. is responsible for having him locked up due to his UFO activities. This subject would have been ignored in the Journal if it had not been for Wendelle's recent statements that a few of his \"followers\" might believe and elevate him to a cult figure stature. If this statement concerning his conviction is offensive to some of our Journal readers, please accept my apology, however, it is our duty to the public to obtain the facts and expose charlatans and hoaxes, wherever they may be. MUFON UFO EXHIBIT Guadalupe County Fair"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE AFO COLUMN UPIAR RESEARCH ByAl Barrier, M.D., Astronomy Advisor Those of you brave enough to conquer the chilly December weather, and who have binoculars, should really step outside late at night and experience our Universe. The stars in December on a clear night seem close enough to touch. Binoculars trained on the Milky Way, will bring the star clouds into your presence as true neighbors. The evening sky in December will be devoid of planets except for Mercury, found low in the southwest about 40 minutes after sunset up until about December 20th. It will be best seen mid-month. However, for those of you arising before the Sun creates dawn, look for giant Venus, dominating the eastern sky at magnitude (-)3.8, and rising about 3 hours before the Sun. Toward the middle of the month, Saturn and Mars can be observed easily in the predawn hours, Saturn rising 3 hours before the Sun and Mars rising 5 hours before the Sun and located near the star Spica in the constellation Virgo. Jupiter is too near the Sun to be seen. On December 14-15 the most famous meteor shower of the year occurs — the Geminids, so named for the constellation in which they seem to originate. The best viewing conditions are between 2-4 AM (after the moon sets). You can greatly enhance your viewing by/lying on your back, away from the glare of city lights. On December 17, a dramatic conjunction of Venus and Saturn occurs in the early morning sky (approximately 5 AM CST). This should be sensational in binoculars or telescope, as well as by naked eye. The planets pass within 1/6 degree of each other. December 19 - full moon 8:00 PM CST. December 21. December solstice - the sun reaches the southernmost point in its annual journey and Winter begins for the Northern Hemisphere. December 28 - 31 • prime time for watching the moon slip through the trio of bright early morning planets. I hope you have a good sparkling Winter viewing of your Universe. See you soon.
