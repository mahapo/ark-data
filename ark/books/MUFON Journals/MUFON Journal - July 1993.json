Perhaps, perhaps not. But my interest was piqued recently by a personal letter from Gordon Creighton, editor of England's Flying Saucer Review, which raised this very issue. At first glance; the issue should be fairly straightforward; after all, if we don't know that about that subject after 45+ years what do we know? FLYING SAUCERS VS. UFOs To begin with, we know that the first \"saucers\" to start it all — Kenneth Arnold's, seen on June 24, 1947 — weren't saucer-shaped at all; rather Arnold described nine, silvery crescent-shaped objects traveling at high speed near Mt. Rainier, Washington. According to Jerome Clark's The UFO Encyclopedia Volume 2 (Omnigraphics, Inc.), Arnold told AP reporter Bill Bequette that the objects behaved like a rock skipping over water. Bequette's original wire service story re- ferred to \"nine bright saucer-like objects,\" an anonymous headline writer came up with \"flying saucers,\" and the rest, as they say, is history. But what about Unidentified Flying Objects, UFOs, where did they come from? Again the answer seems fairly straightforward. Project Blue Book director Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, writing on page one of Chapter One of his now classic The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (Doubleday, 1956) says unequivocably that \"UFO is the official term that I cre- ated to replace the words 'flying saucers.'\" I skimmed Ruppelt's Report trying to come up with the precise time and circumstances under which this etymological legerdemain occurred and came up empty. If Ruppelt elaborates, I didn't find it. Had the fat lady sung? Certainly as far as the general public was concerned the late Ruppelt was the horse's mouth — to slightly mix metaphors — having assumed directorship, in October of 1951, of what was then known as Project Grudge, soon to be Blue Book, which he would head until September of 1953. But when, ex- actly, did Ruppelt coin this catch-all substitute for flying saucers? Here's where things in an already murky field get murkier. For example, Ruppelt himself reports (p. 91) that the final 600-page report released by Grudge — in December of 1949 — was \"officially titled 'Unidentified Flying Objects — Project Grudge,' Technical Report No. 102-AC-49/15-100. But it was widely referred to as the Grudge Report.\" Bless Air Force jargonese, but this raises problems. Most other commentators routinely refer to the docu- ment in question simply as the Grudge Report or by its technical number. If Ruppelt hasn't simply erred, then ei- ther a) the phrase \"Unidentified Flying Objects\" was in existence almost two years prior to his own admitted as- signment to the subject; b) he is claiming credit only for the acronym \"UFO\"; or c) he was involved earlier than publicly admitted. Ruppelt was also apparently responsible for Air Force Letter 200-5 (1951), which led to Blue Book, and which requested that report forms APR 200-2 and 80-18-17 be filed with ATIC at Wright Field in Dayton. Whether UFOs are specifically referenced therein, I don't know, although Ronald Story's The Encyclopedia of UFOs says that \"Unidentified Flying Objects\" were defintely mentioned by name in Chapter II of JANAP 146, which, I believe, also dates to 1951. A scattering of existing documents only casts more confusion on the subject. For instance, a Blue Book briefing Ruppelt gave the Air Defense Command in December of 1952 — classified Secret at the time — contains this statement: \"As you have been told, this briefing is about Unidentified Flying Objects or 'flying saucers' if you insist. We don't like the name 'flying saucers' and only rarely use it because it seems to rep- resent weird stories, hoaxes, etc., sort of a joke.\" (Steiger, Brad. Project Blue Book, Ballantine, 1976, p. 394f) Only the previous summer, however, in an article published in the August 1952, Air Intelligence Digest, Ruppelt apparently referred to flying saucer and/or UFO reports throughout as UAOs — Unidentified Aerial Objects. (Ibid., p. 407f) This reflects wording — UAO — first used in February 1949, by Project Sign — Grudge's predecessor — in USAF report No. F-TR- 2274-1A (Air Force Archives, Maxwell AFB, Montgomery, Alabama). The popular press continued to refer to flying saucers, as opposed to UFOs, throughout most of the '50s, as they still do, although less fre- quently, even today. So how secure is Ruppelt's claim to etymological fame? And if he didn't actually invent or initiate the phrase Unidentified Flying Objects — UFOs — as a le- gitimate alternative to saucer sensationalism, then which lower perfunctory, or higher superior, did, why and when? Readers with more advanced knowledge, and/or with an opinion of their own, are invited to respond. — Dennis Stacy JULY 1993 NUMBER 303 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL CORT1LE CASE: THE MISSING EVIDENCE Some common sense questions and objections continue to plague the celebrated \"Case of the Century. \" By Robert J. Durant T he Linda Cortile multiple witness abduction case is exceptionally complex, but contains elements that are amenable to objective analysis. It is im- portant to distinguish between those elements of the story, such as the alien abduction claim, that are simply beyond our ability to test using standard investigation techniques, and claims that can be reduced to common sense interpretation. I have chosen four of the latter for extended commentary. MISSING HELICOPTER Government agents \"Rich\" and \"Dan\" were transporting a VIP in an automobile heading south, on the east side of lower Manhattan, at approximately 3 a.m. on November 30, 1989 when they sighted the UFO hovering near Linda Cortile's bedroom window. In a letter to Budd Hopkins, Rich and Dan said that the purpose of the trip was to deliver the VIP to a waiting helicopter. An objective test of this portion of the story can be made by determining if any helicopter flight took place at that time of day from the only heliport situated in the direction of travel of the limousine. To this end, I tele- phoned the Downtown Heliport, also known as the Pier Six Heliport, and spoke to two employees. The first man said it would take him a few minutes to look up the log of activities for that date, and trans- ferred me to another employee while he searched. When I mentioned that I was inquiring about a helicopter flight at 3 a.m. on a certain date, and that his partner was searching the logs, he at once exclaimed \"That must be about the UFO that crashed into the East River!\" He proceeded to say that several months prior to my call a man \"in his fifties, with white hair and glasses\" had visited the heliport to ask about a 3 a.m. helicopter flight, and also asked if anyone knew about a UFO that had crashed into the East River at that time. My infor- mant said that the answer was \"no\" to each question. Then the first employee got back on the line and said that the heliport had operated only on a regular schedule during the day in question, meaning from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. This was reflected in the log. Moreover, any deviation from that schedule would have been re- membered by the employees. The heliport, which is operated by the same Port Authority that governs the three major airports in the area, will open on \"off hours, but only by prior arrangement and payment of a stiff extra fee. The workers would have recalled the very unusual 3 a.m. flight as well as the overtime check they would have received for handling it. MISSING WITNESSES Dan and Rich described a large, brightly glowing object hovering near the top of Linda's apartment building, casting a red light strong enough to illuminate the inte- rior of the limousine in which they were carrying the VIP. \"Janet Kimble,\" who viewed the object while it was in the same location, but from more than a quarter of a mile away on the Brooklyn Bridge, said it was so bright that she had to shield her eyes. \"I thought I saw a build- ing on fire in Manhattan. The whole sky lit up.\" Other drivers on the bridge stopped and looked, and several were nearly hysterical, according to Kimble's account: \"Some of them were running all around their cars with their hands on their heads, screaming from horror and disbelief.\" 1 An objective test of this fragment of the story can be made by inquiring if there are witnesses to the UFO other than Dan, Rich and Janet Kimble. The early morn- ing hours in New York City were cool but exceptionally clear. The location of the UFO put it in close proximity to tens of thousands of people, and within potential view of probably at least one hundred thousand residents of the area. Linda's apartment houses 1,600 residents. It has 24- hour security, including roving guards and a gate keeper. The security guards recall nothing concerning a UFO, ei- ther from their own experience or from complaints or comments from tenants. The manager of the apartment had a similar comment when queried, and in fact was in- censed, stating that it was preposterous to claim that a large UFO had hovered next to the building without attracting notice, even at 3 a .m. T he New York Post, a daily newspaper with a very large circulation, is printed two blocks away from Linda's apartment. The newspapers are loaded on trucks from a long dock facing the street, from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. daily. A brightly lit UFO maneuvering near Linda's building would be clearly visible to at least some of the drivers as they made repeated trips to and from the dock from locations throughout the city. The foreman in charge of the dock was interviewed, and stated that none of the many drivers or loaders had mentioned a UFO. 2 Across the East River from Linda's apartment build- ing lies the Borough of Brooklyn, with densely packed housing sloping upward from the waterfront, each build- ing vying with the next for a view of the spectacular Manhattan skyline. Tens of thousands of potential wit- PAGE4 NUMBER 303 JULY 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The city that never sleeps was at least largely look- ing the other way during the early morning hours of November 30, 1989. nesses live there, in plain view of Linda Cortile's apart- ment. The control tower at JFK Airport has a line-of-sight view of the UFO's flight path. LaGuardia Airport's tower personnel could have seen the UFO as it maneu- vered upward carrying Linda away and, presumably, back. Ships standing off New York Harbor could see it, as could the many airplanes that fly to the three metro- politan airports even in the early morning hours. Major roads and bridges carry substantial traffic at 3 a.m. These include the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan bridge which parallels the Brooklyn Bridge and would afford drivers a view equal to Janet Kimble's, the FDR Drive (under which Dan, Rich and the VIP stopped to view the UFO), and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which offers three lanes each way with a perfect view of the expanse between Linda's apartment and the Brooklyn Bridge. They may fold up the streets at 9 p.m. in Canby, Minnesota or Seguin, Texas, but a very substantial por- tion of the vast population living in Manhattan and Brooklyn is awake and on the job or having fun at 3 a.m. They were available when the darkness was shattered by the brilliantly glowing UFO on a night with nearly un- limited visibility. Janet Kimble summed it up: \"I'm say- ing to myself, 'other people had to see it.' New York never sleeps.\" According to Dan and Rich, this literally spectacu- lar sight was not stationary. After the abduction process was complete, the UFO flew southeast for more than a quarter of a mile at what must have been an altitude at least equal to Linda's 12th story bed- room, passing over the Brooklyn Bridge, and then plunging into the East River, \"...not far from Pier 17.\" Janet Kimble tells us that \"It passed over a highway, or drive, below, and then proceeded to climb higher, over the center of the bridge.\" Manhattan's Pier 17 is the location of the Fulton Fish Market, New York's main wholesale fish center, sepa- rated by only one-half mile from the Brooklyn docks on the other side of the East River. A large, brightly lit UFO descending into those crowded waters would cer- tainly raise the interest of even the most stolid fishermen and stevedores. The UFO was not merely brightly lit, but it was also huge. Rich and Dan, from an ideal vantage point and us- ing binoculars, say it was \"about three quarters the size of the building across,\" which makes it approximately 150 feet in diameter. Janet Kimble stated that the UFO was wider than the side of the apartment building. The complex presents to persons in the position of Richard, Dan and Janet Kimble an esthetically pleasing series of vertical serrated faces, each about 50 feet wide. It may be that they observed the architecture behind the hov- ering UFO so acutely that they meant such a face instead of the entire building. Given the claimed emotional state of the witnesses, and the brilliance of the UFO, this interpretation seems implausible, but it is consistent with their drawings of the event, which would give the UFO a diameter on the order of 50 feet. But it is not my prerogative to put words in the mouths of these wit- nesses, so I will use 150 feet, a conservative figure based on their testimony. In addition to the problem of extraordinarily high visibility with no witnesses, this testimony introduces the problem of how a UFO of such large dimensions could navigate in this area of Manhattan and avoid collision with other buildings; for example, with the 17-floor apartment building located 170 feet directly across the street from the abduction site. Every common sense consideration tells us that the event should have caused a furor, with intense police and fire department activity, and of course extravagant me- dia interest in the days that followed. But the only wit- nesses we have to this brilliantly lit object arcing through the perfect night air and crashing into the East River are the mysterious Rich and Dan, the uncooperative VIP, and Janet Kimble, who squinted, terrified, through shielded eyes on the Brooklyn Bridge. MISSING RADAR & VIDEO Since 1983 the U.S. Coast Guard has operated a low light video camera which tapes maritime activity on the East River in the vicinity of the UFO crash, in addi- tion to various other heavily used areas in New York Harbor. According to a Coast Guard spokesman, \"We'd have a video tape of it...and we also have constant sur- veillance by radar.\" The radar antenna, which is used to track and coordinate all vessels in the area, is located on Governor's Island, 1.1 miles south of the UFO crash site. The system operates like air traffic control, monitoring all harbor movements. It was installed to avoid disasters like the 1983 collision in dense fog of the huge bulk cargo ship Hough Orchid with the rush hour Staten Island Ferry. The video cameras might have shown cars on the bridge rolling to a halt, and the flitting shadows that we could later identify as the terrorized motorists who had abandoned their automobiles, and then the magnificent sight of the UFO sweeping over the bridge and gliding down to the water. Only the sound would be left to our imaginations, the screamed prayers of the motorists, the cascading rumble of the UFO as it plowed into the East River and sank, fathoms down, with its precious cargo. \"From the Governor's Island station, from the win- dows at the duty desk, you look right up the East River, right under the Brooklyn Bridge. There's some- JULY 1993 NUMBER 303 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL body sitting there 24 hours a day,\" the spokesman told me. I asked if the Coast Guard had personnel in the water at 3 a.m., and the answer was no, but they have rescue swimmers, boats and helicopters prepared for rescue duty round the clock. They also cooperate with the New York City police patrol launches as well as with the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates boats in the harbor. Underscoring the obvious, he summed up by say- ing, \"A 150 foot object would make quite a splash. We'd know about it.\" 3 MISSING IMPLANT Linda Cortile states that she has a history of nose prob- lems, and that she had an X-ray of her nose taken, and that the developed picture was delivered in person at her apartment by the physician. The photograph shows an extraordinary object in stark relief against the muted outlines of her facial features. The object is rectangular. Protruding from each end of the rectangle is a helical wire, extending in rotation approximately 270 degrees. A follow-up X-ray revealed that the object, which has been characterized by Linda Cortile and Budd Hopkins as an alien implant, was no longer visible. Alien im- plants are almost universally described as small spheres lacking appendages. David Jacobs says this about im- plants in his comprehensive review of the abduction phenomenon, Secret Life: \"The object is as small as or smaller than a BB, and it usually is smooth, or has small spikes sticking out of it, or has holes in it.\" Thus both the shape and very large size, relative to the received description of implants, make the Cortile object unique in the literature. The implant provides us with a clear path for inves- tigation, but in this instance we must rely upon Mrs. Cortile and her physician to cooperate. The provenance of the X-ray should be easy to determine, and an affi- davit from her physician would satisfy all but the most hard-headed. It should include Linda's medical history as it pertains to her nose, as well as what must be the physician's very vivid recollections of her intense pro- fessional investigation on medical grounds that was touched off by this exceptional incident. An expert in X-ray photography should be consulted, and a second opinion from a medical practitioner com- petent in nose dysfunction should be sought in order to review the work and conclusions of the primary physi- cian. Indeed, so important is the X-ray in establishing the factual basis for the Linda Cortile \"Case of the Century,\" that I will personally pledge $500 to help defray the costs of employing the expert witnesses required.

Personal communication, 2 June 1993, Mr. Jim McGranachan, Director of Media and Community Mr. Durant Is a veteran of 27 years as an airline pilot and 30 years as a ufologlst, with a special Interest In abductions and government Involvement with the UFO enigma. His articles have previously appeared In the Journal and the Bulletin of Anomalous Experience. He Is the MUFON section director for Mercer County, NJ. BUDD HOPKINS REPLIES I n 1975, when I began my first investigation into a po- tentially major UFO case (the North Hudson Park landing report), I ran head first into the same problem Durant raises eighteen years later with regard to the Cortile case. It is a problem that has been faced by UFO investigators throughout the history of the phe- nomenon, and it can be simply stated: On the one hand we have vivid, mutually corroborative testimony from credible witnesses, and on the other hand we have the common sense feeling that there should have been more witnesses — perhaps many more — if the incident oc^ curred as described. In the North Hudson Park UFO case, an event I de- tailed in my book Missing Time, two witnesses inde- pendently described a 3:00 a.m. UFO landing within a few hundred feet of the Hudson River, within sight of many apartment buildings, roads, and private homes. All of the questions raised by Durant in his article on the later Cortile incident apply to this 1975 case, in spades. In 1975, the brilliantly-lit UFO should have been seen by thousands. The New Jersey palisades location of the UFO — on high ground in a public park — would have been visible to far more people in New Jersey and Manhattan apartment buildings than could have seen the Cortile UFO from Manhattan or Brooklyn apart- ment buildings. What's more, the New Jersey UFO, lights blazing from panels around its perimeter, appar- ently sat on the ground for a longer period of time than the later UFO hovered above the Cortiles' building. Though the Cortile case has far more witnesses, more physical evidence of various kinds and more internal PAGE 6 NUMBER 303 JULY 1993"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL corroboration than the New Jersey Case, it has been at- tacked far more vehemently by a small group of de- bunkers just because it is such a solid case. Prior to Linda Cortile, Travis Walton held the record for having suffered the most incessant villification of any abductee by people within the UFO community, and for the same reason: the case was thought to be too good. There were six witnesses to the Walton UFO, to the blue beam of light which knocked Travis down, and to his subse- quent disappearance. Polygraph testing virtually ruled out a hoax, and yet Walton and the other witnesses were as viciously attacked as Linda Cortile, her family, and the other witnesses in that case. One can easily assume from this that we prefer our abduction cases to be am- biguous and to lack corroborating witnesses. If the case is solid, UFO investigators who should know better are often tempted to try and discredit the witnesses, be- cause, as Dr. John Mack pointed out, such reports make us intolerably nervous. I remember a CBS program on UFOs that appeared sometime around 1966, anchored by Walter Cronkite. In an interview with an Air Force general, Cronkite asked if radar had ever picked up anything it couldn't identify. The general answered as one might have expected, claiming that his men had never seen anything on radar they couldn't explain. Durant makes much in his piece about an unidentified Coast Guard spokesman having implied, with regard to the Cortile case, that they had not picked up anything they couldn't explain, either. In both the North Hudson Park and the Cortile case, the UFOs would probably not have been seen on radar, a fact I dis- covered in 1975 when an air traffic controller explained to me the problem of false returns from ground clutter at lower altitudes. Objects such as the Brooklyn Bridge and the buildings of the Manhattan skyline create impossible obstacles for following low flying craft of any sort — es- pecially when they enter the waters of the East River. The radar issue is moot. If, as Durant implies, the Coast Guard has a videotape of the area that can definitely be dated to 3:15 a.m., Nov. 30, 1989, it should be reviewed. I doubt that such a tape exists, or that ten or twelve hours of nightly tap- ing are regularly and systematically reviewed by anyone — unless, of course, an accident requires such a re- view. Both the radar and the videotape issues that Durant raises are moot. B ut as I stated earlier with regard to the 1975 case, my choice was either to believe the two direct eye- witnesses and a corroborating police lieutenant, or to ar- gue that they were all lying just because I or someone else felt there should have been more witnesses. As it turned out, once the case received city-wide media at- tention, other witnesses did come forward. I trust that when the Cortile case receives city-wide publicity the same thing will happen. Durant uses emotionally charged language to make his point that he is bothered that more witnesses have so far not come forward. The time the UFO spent visibly hovering above the Cortiles' building was anywhere from one to three minutes, and its flight away and into the river was probably no more than another minute or so. But Durant claims that this 2 to 5 minute 3:15 a.m. incident \"should have caused a furor, with intense police and fire department activity and ... extravagant media in- terest in the days that followed\"! He has the craft \"crash- ing\" into the \"crowded waters\" of the East River. He imagines the \"screamed prayers\" of the motorists and the \"cascading rumble\" of the UFO as it \"plowed\" into the water. With writing this vivid, how might he describe the Roswell incident? To apply his reasoning to that event, logically we would have to be suspicious because if a UFO — or even two UFOs — crashed there in 1947, literally scores, and perhaps hundreds, of soldiers would have been involved. Since we do not have scores of wit- nesses to the bodies, the wreckage or the crash, Durant would probably have to claim that Jesse Marcel and the other direct witnesses are lying. The principle seems to be that in the absence of what one or another of us might expect to have happened, all eyewitness testi- mony and physical evidence is immediately suspect. Durant also makes a great deal of the agent Dan's mention in a letter that on the night of Nov. 30, 1989, he, Richard and the third man were heading for a downtown heliport. The only evidence we have for this is his letter: it may, of course, be a cover story. The Heliport itself is a small, right-angled pier, separated from the shoreline by a padlocked cyclone fence. The men who work in the adjacent building are not on duty at 3:00 a.m., as I de- termined many months ago. The police informed me that the President sometimes lands at that location, and I learned a most important additional fact — the landing lights are kept on all night, even though the gate is pad- locked and the pad ostensibly closed. However, one can assume that any authorized government agent with a key and an official mission can unlock the gate, and in- formally utilize the heliport. Again, to make the heliport a decisive issue is to claim that the existence of bu- reaucratic rules somehow refutes the testimony of thir- teen people and proves the existence of the most massive hoax in UFO history. According to this theory, everyone is proved to be lying because, as the Air Force General said, \"This sort of thing can't have happened or we would surely have known about it.\" Other flaws in Durant's presentation have to do with his preference for an estimated 150' diameter of the UFO over the 50' diameter that the descriptions make possible, and his inference that a UFO that big might crash into buildings! UFO occupants have made mis- takes before, but no one calls them reckless drivers. Richard stated in his report that after his car stopped and was pushed into a safe position under the FDR JULY 1993 NUMBER 303 PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Drive, a reddish reflection in his chewing gum wrapper caused him to look up and see the UFO. But in Durant's overwrought rendering, the \"red light [was] strong enough to illuminate the interior of the limousine\" 1 ^. (My emphasis) And for that matter, the car was never referred to by the witnesses as a limousine. In Durant's descrip- tion, however, the red light has to \"illuminate\" an even larger car interior and so is made to seem even more powerful. The final point of his article has to do with the X-ray of Linda's implant, and his objection that the object had unusual appendages not described in the literature. Debbie Tomey (\"Kathie Davis\" in Intruders) once de- scribed a small shaft-like object being extracted from her ear. After it had been removed, the person (alien?) hold- ing it touched it and two flanges popped out of it like the barbs of a fishhook. During an early hypnosis session, Linda Cortile described a shaft-like object being in- serted in her nostril. The later X-ray showing what was probably the same apparent implant, but now with \"an- choring flanges\" similar to those on the Tomey implant, took her aback, since it was different from what she'd re- membered. (Naturally she had no knowledge of the similarity of her implant to Debbie's, a fact which fur- ther supports her credibility.) More work must be done on the simultaneous nose- bleeds that Linda, her husband, sons and house guest suffered in 1992, and further X-rays and examinations are in order. Therefore, it is with pleasure that I accept Robert Durant's kind offer of $500 to explore this im- portant implant issue. I would like to end this hurried piece with a request. In the future I would appreciate hearing by letter from colleagues who have questions about the Cortile case. Answering these questions in various UFO journals is te- dious and time-consuming, and readers who do not read my replies can easily be left with an incorrect view of the case. Please write to me before publishing so that we can try to straighten out these misunderstandings by subsequent telephone calls. I deliberately >did not deal with Durant's remarks about the New York Post since I had covered that issue in my recent IUR article. As I said, time is precious. Mr. Hopkins is the author of Missing Time and Intruders, and a frequent contributor to these pages. The Editor comments: Certainly the Cortile Case has generated more than its fair share of controversy, elic- iting high emotions on both sides of the argument. In all fairness, then, a number of things need to be pointed out in regards to Mr. Durant 's article and Mr. Hopkins' re- sponse. First, as best I read Durant, he neither villifies any of the primary witnesses involved, accuses anyone of lying, nor does he necessarily imply (in Hopkins' words) that the case is \"the most massive hoax in UFO history.\" Essentially, he simply asks, \"Where are the other wit- nesses?\" The Brooklyn Bridge, Coast Guard and New York Post loading docks aside, where are the witnesses from the Fulton Fish Market? If the answer is simply \"I don't yet know,\" then so be it, and no blame should be attached for saying so. Concerning the Coast Guard radar station on Governor's Island, Durant says that \"the system oper- ates like air traffic control, monitoring all harbor move- ments. \" (My emphasis.) Hopkins responds as if the sys- tem were monitoring only air traffic, when clearly it is used to monitor ship traffic (although low-flying planes and helicopters would no doubt show up, too). At some point, assuming it actually entered the East River, the UFO theoretically would have appeared on Coast Guard radar, which arguably had a clear line of electromag- netic sight over the water, with no intervening buildings or other ground clutter. The radar and video issue may be moot in that we wouldn 't necessarily expect the Coast Guard to 'fess up to any evidence from same, but it certainly isn 't moot in the overall context. (Also, Mr. Durant's \"unidentified Coast Guard spokesman\" isn't unidentified at all. In fact, he's identi- fied as a Mr. Jim McGranachan in Durant's note number 3.) By the same token, a commercial helicopter pad might hand over the keys to government agents to come and go as they will, but such a procedure would seem highly unorthodox to say the least. But if the Richard and Dan story is indeed a cover story — a possibility to which Hopkins himself alludes — then critics are cer- tainly justified in wondering what other aspects of it may be suspect as well. Durant's assumption that Richard and Dan were dri- ving a limousine is wholly reasonable, assuming that a VIP was indeed involved. Surely Hopkins is not arguing that the interior of a Volkswagen bug would have been illuminated but that that of a limousine wouldn't have been? The size of the car (and/or the UFO itself) should not be an issue at all. After all, \"Janet Kimble, \" at a greater remove than Richard and Dan, thought a build- ing was on fire and said she had to shield her eyes be- cause the UFO was so bright. In conclusion, perfectly legitimate questions remain about the Cortile Case and those compelled to ask them should not be viewed as internal pariahs or otherwise \"unpatriotic\" citizens of the UFO research community. With this, though, barring unforeseen developments, the Journal is patient to await Hopkins' upcoming book on the subject. And we leave it to the parties involved to work out Mr. Durant's $500 offer.

By Robert L. Hall, Donald A. Johnson and Mark Rodeghier A s many readers of the MUFON UFO Journal know, a booklet entitled Unusual Personal Experiences was widely circulated in 1992, reporting a nationwide survey focusing on UFO abduc- tions. The survey, planned and directed by Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, appears to have been de- signed to measure the prevalence of UFO abductions by asking a series of key questions of a random sample of U.S. adults. The results of the survey were distributed to literally thousands of psychological professionals so as to alert therapists and clinicians to the troublesome problems of self-reported abductees and to the magni- tude of the phenomenon. The results have also been widely reported in the popular press, often with little, if any, skeptical commentary on the survey. From informal reports, we gather that the study has been useful in attracting interest among psychothera- pists, which we applaud. It has, though, been a clear fail- ure in its effort to assess the prevalence of abductions among the population, for reasons to be addressed in this article. Prior important contributions by Hopkins and Jacobs (hereafter H&J) should not cloud our perceptions of this survey. We believe that healthy debate is critical for the advancement of knowledge in any discipline, and so we enter the fray. (In an article in the 1992 Journal of UFO Studies, we have made a more technical critique.) SURVEY RESEARCH IN BRIEF Before we talk more about the abduction survey, it will be helpful to discuss the characteristics of surveys and question-writing. The public often believes — as do many physical scientists — that social science research is rather easy to undertake, and that its conclusions are often unnecessarily complicated restatements of the ob- vious or trivial. We've all heard such stories as the one about a psychologist who announced the discovery that people spend more time with people they like than with those whom they dislike. But the best social science is not easy to do, in part because people and societies are much more complicated subjects than atoms or mole- cules. Moreover, the most interesting social science findings are not obvious or trivial. As illustration, and contrary to what many might believe, research has re- vealed that people who are regular churchgoers are ac- tually more racially prejudiced than other people. This type of knowledge is clearly important for society but not easy to come by. The public's attitude toward social science carries over to survey research, a technique used by many social scientists — economists, sociologists, political scientists, and psychologists, among others. It seems on first glance that writing questions is not a hard thing to do, and some of you may have even written small question- naires for work or a volunteer activity. How difficult, af- ter all, can it be to learn someone's age? The question \"What is your current age?\" seems to do it just fine. Actually, writing any but the most simple questions is not an easy task. This isn't to imply that one needs to be Einstein to do the job. Writing questions is instead a matter of attention to detail, knowledge of the literature on survey design and question writing, adequate pretest- ing, and the use of standard checks for reliability and, hopefully, validity (both to be defined below). Like much of science, it is 98% perspiration, and 2% inspi- ration. Let's return to the example above about asking someone's age. It turns out that the straightforward question is not the best way to gather that information for everyone. Older people often don't have their age immediately available, and they miscalculate it in their head. This is especially true on telephone surveys. For adults, a better question is \"What year were you born?\" U sually the best way to measure an attitude (or opinion, or exposure to a particular kind of knowl- edge or experience) is to construct a scale, composed of multiple questions. For any measurement (e.g., survey question or scale), a social scientist will attempt to assess both reliability and validity. In simplified terms, the re- liability of a measure is a question of whether repetitions of the measurement procedure yield similar results — repetitions over time and/or repetitions by different ob- servers. Efforts to assess reliability try to separate errors of measurement from true variations in the thing mea- sured. If repetitions of the measurement yield different results, the measure is not very reliable; i.e., there is too much error in the measurement. Also in simplified terms, the validity of a measure refers to the question of whether it actually measures what the investigator believes that it does. There are complex philosophical and technical problems of as- sessing validity. However, it is clear that a highly unre- liable measure cannot be valid, and that a highly reliable measure may or may not be valid. For example, if we ask people in a survey the number of automobile acci- dents they have had, most people underreport accidents, especially those more than a year or two in the past, so these responses are not valid. However, the underre- porting is consistent. That is, people reliably underreport accidents so that a survey report of accidents is reliable JULY 1993 NUMBER 303 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL but not valid. In principle reliability and validity should always be systematically assessed if the results of survey research are to be taken seriously. Much experience has shown that personal judgments of reliability and valid- ity cannot be trusted. For scales composed of multiple items, there are straightforward standard techniques to measure relia- bility. Unfortunately, there is no comparably simple method to assess a scale's validity, and validity is a particularly vexing problem when one attempts to con- struct a scale that measures some experience or behav- ior not mentioned explicitly in the questions. Take an ex- ample that is a very close analogy to the H&J effort to measure abduction indirectly. Imagine trying to find out if someone is abusing his or her children by asking indirect questions about the consequences and outcomes of such behavior (Do your children have any bruises or other injuries?) or its correlates or causes (Were you abused when you were a child?). Using such questions would probably yield a measure of little validity unless the indirect questions were known to be always associ- ated with abusive behavior. Otherwise, it is certainly possible, indeed highly probable, that you will have a scale that does not measure what you believe it does. Another useful distinction made by survey re- searchers is the distinction between \"findings\" and \"con- clusions.\" Findings refer to simple assertions about the statistical results obtained: e.g.. persons who had high levels of education tended also to score high on the \"political tolerance\" scale. Conclusions are more sub- stantive assertions which suggest the potential impor- tance of the survey results by interpreting why the par- ticular findings were obtained: e.g., education causes an increase in tolerance for deviant political views and practices. The conclusions must be consistent with the findings, but any set of findings is capable of more than one set of conclusions. Drawing conclusions is a matter of making an interpretation of the findings. With these comments as background, let's return to our consideration of the H&J survey. WHAT DOES THE SURVEY SHOW? WHAT ARE ITS FINDINGS? The H&J survey was actually conducted by the Roper organization, which is very experienced at doing sur- veys. As a result we can have good confidence in find- ings of the survey because acceptable procedures of sampling, interviewing, and data reduction are used. H&J had Roper ask the respondents (5,947 in total) eleven questions about various experiences. Each item could be answered with one of three responses: has happened once or twice, more than twice, or never. H&J say that these questions were written, and classified into three categories, on the basis of their own investi- gations and knowledge of abductee experiences. The three categories were: (a) five \"indicator questions\" which H&J believe to be \"symptoms\" of an abduction The conclusion that as many as 3.7 million American adults may have been abducted Is totally unjustified. experience; (b) one \"lie\" question, intended to pick out persons who answered positively just to please the in- terviewer or for related reasons; (c) five items about unusual or occult experiences like seeing a ghost or a UFO or having an out-of-body experience. The five questions selected by H&J as indicator ques- tions were: (1) Do you remember waking up paralyzed with a sense of a strange person or presence or some- thing else in the room? (2) Do you remember experi- encing a period of an hour or more in which you were apparently lost, but you could not remember why, or where you had been? (3) Do you remember feeling that you were actually flying through the air although you didn't know why or how? (4) Do you remember having seen unusual lights or balls of light in a room without knowing what was causing them, or where they came from? (5) Do you remember finding puzzling scars on your body and neither you nor anyone else remembering how you received them or where you got them? The survey shows that: (1) For the five indicator questions, from 8% to 18% of respondents report the ex- perience at least once. (2) For the five odd experience questions, from 5% to 15% report the experience. (3) Only about 1% answer the \"lie\" question positively. (4) About 2% of respondents answer at least four of the five indicator questions positively. These are the principal findings of the survey, though there are others, for ex- ample, the relationship of responses to age, political activism, etc. WHAT ARE THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE SURVEY? H&J try to make some rather strong claims from the sur- vey findings, the most crucial being that perhaps 2% of the American adult population are abductees. This figure is based on the 119 survey respondents who answered in the affirmative to at least four of the five indicator ques- tions. H&J say that this criterion is \"based upon the data we have collected,\" but they do not present any data to justify this particular criterion of a \"probable ab- ductee.\" Such a conclusion is totally unjustified in light of the fact that they offer no evidence at all for the va- lidity of their central measure. In truth, this survey provides no scientific evidence about the prevalence of UFO abductions, unless we ac- cept a number of implausible assumptions. In terms of the discussion of survey research above, we question the validity of the indicator items. More broadly, we ques- tion the entire justification for the conclusions they draw from the survey findings. What the authors did was to construct a scale from these five indicator items. H&J believe that positive answers to any four of these five questions indicates that a person has \"probably\" been abducted, because the self-reported abductees whom they have interviewed PAGE 10 NUMBER 303 JULY 1993"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL usually answer these questions positively. In other words, they argue that the indicator items are a valid measure of an abduction experience. Their argument, of course, is il- logical, because even if all abductees answered these questions positively, it does not follow logically that all who answer them positively are abductees. H ere is an analogous situation. Imagine that we wanted to estimate how many people regularly use cocaine, but we would not trust their answers to direct questions because they might lie. Instead, we might note, from our personal experience, that every co- caine user we have ever encountered has sinus problems (often true). So we decide to estimate how many regu- larly use cocaine by asking, \"Do you have sinus prob- lems?\" In this case the illogic is obvious. Many people have sinus problems but don't use cocaine. At most what a positive answer may indicate is that the persons are in a risk group (sinus sufferers) who are more likely to use cocaine, but clearly many in the risk group would not use cocaine, and many who use cocaine do not have sinus problems. We will seriously overestimate the prevalence of persons who regularly use cocaine by this method. The problem of misestimating prevalence is, in large part, caused by lack of evidence about the validity of the indicator items. Is it really true that answering four out of these five in the affirmative means that you are prob- ably an abductee? In truth, there are many alternative reasons why people might answer the indicator questions positively. H&J simply assume all other possibilities wrong. There is evidence from other surveys that people answer such questions positively fairly often, especially from the work of David Hufford, who has studied inci- dents of sleep paralysis. H&J offer no data to support the validity of the indi- cator items, only their assertions. There are many rea- sons to question the indicator items' ability to predict the likelihood of abduction. Hufford's several studies have demonstrated the rather common occurrence of waking up paralyzed and sensing a presence in the room. He has not found, among this population, any comparably large numbers of persons with UFO abduction-like experi- ences. Many alcoholics would (if honest) give a positive answer to indicator question 2 (experiencing an hour or more of lost time). In addition, a small fraction of the population is prone to dissociative episodes and would probably also answer question 2 in the affirmative. There are many people who report the experience of ball lightning in a room, and they would surely give a posi- tive answer to question 4 (having seen unusual balls of light in a room). Also the commonplace nature of scars that seem to have no origin need hardly be mentioned. Although H&J are aware that these questions might have alternative interpretations, as they discuss in a sec- tion entitled \"How This Survey Was Designed,\" they fail to mention most of the issues we raise above. When they A bad piece of research has the opposite of the Intended effect: ft reinforces the prior opinion of our fellow scientists that the whole UFO phenomenon Is lacking In evidence and that people who take ft seri- ously are simply beings fools. do touch on these issues, we find their argument un- convincing and unsupported by any evidence. For ques- tion 3 (about feeling that you were flying), H&J say that by adding the word \"actually\" and adding the qualifying phrase \"although you didn't know why or how,\" they \"hoped\" the respondents would not answer positively because of simple flying dreams. Well, two of us would answer this question positively (although we are not abductees) because of very vivid flying dreams we have had. At the time of the dream, we certainly remember the feeling of actually flying without cause. H&J may hope that people do not read the question the way we do, but they have no evidence to show how respondents interpreted the question. The burden of proof is on the authors of a survey to document the meaning of their questions. H&J did not take the standard precaution of pretesting their survey questions systematically to find out how people did in- terpret them. We have shown that there are plausible rea- sons (and we could have offered several more) why the respondents might have answered these questions as they did, without having been abducted. This means that the items cannot be used to measure the preva- lence of abductions until further evidence is produced. As for the reliability of the five indicator items, the odd thing is that it is never mentioned in the booklet. We have no real reason to doubt the scale's reliability, but measuring reliability is a simple statistical calculation. That it was not done casts serious doubt on the authors' understanding of this kind of research. WHY RAISE A FUSS? Any social scientist who understands survey research and questionnaire design will immediately recognize the obvious flaws in the H&J study. What happens, then, when such research is published and promulgated widely? Bluntly put, we lose credibility. For many years, we who believe that UFOs are a real and important phenomenon have faced difficulty getting many scien- tists — physical, biological, and behavioral — to pay se- rious attention to the phenomenon. Some scientists have taken a personal interest but been unwilling to be pub- licly identified with the subject for fear of ridicule. Others have been closed-minded skeptics who refused even to take a serious look at the evidence, much like the astronomers who refused to look through Galileo's tele- scope. They \"knew\" the telescope was deceptive be- cause it showed things that were inconsistent with cur- rent scientific knowledge.

By David Gotlib, M. D. T here are changes coming in the social and sci- entific climate that will profoundly affect everyone with a personal or professional inter- est in anomalous experiences, particularly in the realm of abduction reports. The vanguard of this change goes by the name of False Memory Syndrome (FMS). FMS refers to the recovery of long-repressed memo- ries of childhood abuse that have no basis in fact. In FMS an individual (most often a female) goes to a therapist with a problem (marriage, children, or an eating disorder, for example). During therapy, memo- ries of childhood sexual abuse that were not present before therapy surface. The therapist accepts these memories as substantially factual, and encourages the patient to do the same. The client emerges from thera- py with the belief that all or most of her problems are related to this history of abuse. The client accuses her abuser, frequently a father or close relative. The fami- ly is split apart. Sometimes the patient sues the family or the abuser. The problem is that the rest of the family genuinely cannot remember these incidents; moreover, they are sure the incidents did not happen. They are devastated by the accusations, bitterly resentful of their family bi- ography being rewritten and their family rent asunder, by what they perceive as a zealous therapist planting ideas in their child's mind. Some families, especially those being sued by sur- vivors with newly-awakened memories of abuse, go to the trouble of collecting information that demonstrates that the memories could not possibly be accurate — for instance, that Uncle Jimmy could not possibly have molested Sally at the age of 6 because Uncle Jimmy did not even live in town or visit at that time. Individuals who have come to believe that their mem- ories of abuse are in fact false, the families who have lived through this nightmare, and mental health profes- sionals concerned about the problem, have come to- gether to form the False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF). They produce an impressive information kit, consisting of a collection of reprints of scientific articles discussing the fallibility of memory, and newspaper ar- ticles about FMS. The FMS Foundation also produces a regular newsletter. A book about this phenomenon was published in 1992: Confabulations: Creating False Memories — Destroying Families by Eleanor Goldstein (SIRS Books, Boca Raton, FL). FALLIBLE MEMORIES The scientific premise of FMS is that memory is not as infallible as we would like to think: \"Researchers who study memory and the brain are discovering the brain's capacity to construct and invent reality from the information it processes. Their studies support what po- ets and novelists have always known: That memory is not a fixed thing, with its own special place or file drawer in the brain. It is a process that is constantly being reinvented. A 'memory' consists of fragments of the event, subsequent discussions and reading, other people's recollections and suggestions, and, perhaps most of all, present beliefs about the past.\" m FMSF advocates do not dispute the ability of the mind to repress memories; they do, however, challenge the unquestioning acceptance of all memories, espe- cially those without factual corroboration. Similarly, they do not question the fact \"that in the past there was a bias not to believe a person who said that he or she had been abused. That bias was not right. But neither is it right to convince people to think they were abused or to destroy families.\" m In an excellent article on this subject in The New York Times Book Review, social psychologist Carol Tavris describes FMS's concern about therapists: \"Of course, all clients in therapy are influenced by the therapist's theoretical framework. This is why people in psychoanalysis have Freudian dreams, people in Jungian therapy have archetypal dreams, people in primal scream therapy remember being born and people in past-lives therapy remember being Julius Caesar (or whoever). Yet there is a sensitive line between any therapist's nor- mal probing for evidence of certain psychological prob- lems and literally creating them by the force of sugges- tion. Wendy Maltz and Beverly Holman, therapists in Eugene, Ore., make the process explicit in Incest and Sexuality: 'It may take considerable digging on the part of the therapist,' they say, 'to discover incest as the cause of the symptoms being experienced by the client.' When does 'considerable digging' become undue per- suasion? On this subtle matter, the [self-help] books are silent.\" [ \" S elf-help books for incest survivors are also cited as contributing to the production of false memories and victims. Ellen Bass and Laura Davis are quoted in The Courage To Heal as saying, \"If you are unable to re- member any specific instances...but still have a feeling that something abusive happened to you, it probably did....If you think you were abused and your life shows \\ the symptoms, then you were.\" Many of these books, in- PAGE 12 NUMBER 303 JULY 1993"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL eluding The Courage To Heal, provide detailed \"incest survivors' aftereffects checklists\" of symptoms that are broad enough to cover most complaints that females present to therapists with. As Tavris says, \"Women abused as children are in- deed more likely than others to be depressed and to have low self esteem as adults, although there is no good evidence from longitudinal studies showing that such abuse invariably causes the entire litany of women's problems. Nor does it follow that all women who are depressed, are sexually conflicted or wear baggy clothes were abused as children. Yet many are be- ing encouraged to rifle their memories for clues that they were.\" m ANOMALOUS EXPERIENCES What does this have to do with anomalous experiences, and for abduction experiences in particular? Everything. The FMS literature attacks research and (especially) therapeutic efforts in anomalies: \"...'Remembered' past lives, space alien abuse, satanic ritual conspiracies or af- ter-death experiences are generally viewed by main- stream professionals as evidence that the 'disease of the month' is alive and well. Such practices are splinter notions, nontraditional practices so silly that they do not dignify a response...\" 131 An FMSF newsletter from late 1992 carried the pas- sage above in an article calling for \"prudent therapy.\" Outraged parents, they say, \"ask how the representatives of the professional organizations can remain silent about the age regression therapy as exemplified by Dr. John Mack, Harvard University psychiatrist, in which people recover memories of space alien abduction. Parents ask, 'Isn't this encouraging delusions? Is this prudent prac- tice?\" 131 That issue also carried a pair of cartoons ridiculing the abduction phenomenon. Tavris makes a similar comment in her New York Times Book Review article: \"...And if a woman suspects that she has been ab- ducted by U.F.O.'s, that the F.B.I, is bugging her socks or that a satanic cult forced her to bear a child that was half human and half dog, must she (and we) likewise as- sume that 'it probably really happened' \"? '\" FMSF is true to its assertion that serious consideration of these phenomena \"do not dignify a response.\" There is no serious discussion of the knowledge we have ac- quired so far about the abduction experience, or about anomalous experiences in general. All such experiences are summarily dismissed as artifacts of the mind, un- worthy of study. Their position on anomalies is in sharp contrast to their frequent reassurances that some, but cer- tainly not all, cases of reported childhood sexual abuse are false. This offhand dismissal of anomalous experiences is particularly regrettable because some of the concerns ex- pressed above regarding false memories of child abuse The coming social and scientific backlash Is going to want to know, how many abductees has ufology created In Its efforts to Investigate the phenomenon, however well-intentioned? are worthy of consideration in the field of abduction re- search and therapy. The all-encompassing symptoms checklist for sexual abuse survivors has its parallels in the abduction field. The admonition from The Courage To Heal that \"if you are unable to remember any specific instances...but still have a feeling that something abusive happened to you, it probably did,\" is paralleled by the use of hypnotic regression, where few or no conscious memories exist, to explore suspected abduction experi- ences, and the expectation on the part of possible expe- riencers that they will be regressed by the therapist or in- vestigator. IATROGENIC ABUSE The question that concerns us here is not whether the ab- duction experience is more than simply false memo- ries. The FMS people do not argue that sexual abuse does not exist, or that it exists but no one is traumatized as a result. Their concern is with iatrogenic abuse mem- ories, (latrogenic means \"Induced in a patient by a physician's activity, manner or therapy.\") In the same way, while some in the abduction field continue to focus their attention on proving the existence of UFOs and aliens, they may find themselves shut down by a social and scientific backlash that argues a different point: How many abductees has the field created in its efforts to explore the phenomenon (however well-meaning those efforts might be)? This backlash might be di- rected specifically against UFOlogy, or it might be part of a general movement against therapy based on un- covering of long-repressed memories, especially those predicated on fringe theories (the abduction phenome- non, whether you subscribe to an Intruders, Imaginal, or Space Brothers hypothesis, is still fringe). I described an imaginary worst-case scenario based on such a backlash in a paper I presented at the Abduction Study Conference at M.I.T. in June 1992.' 4 ' During or after an investigation, an abductee suffers an emotional breakdown, perhaps even commits sui- cide. A member of the family, who is not an experiencer and who is not sympathetic to the idea of abductions as legitimate experiences, feels, rightly or wrongly, that the intervention of the investigator is in some way respon- sible for the breakdown. Such an angry relative might then bring a civil suit against the investigator and others involved in the study of the case, claiming negligence. Negligence involves the violation of what the court might find to be the duty of care owed by the investigator to the experiencer. If the court did find that such a duty of care exists, then the fol- lowing question would be asked: Did the person who owed that duty (the investigator) conduct himself or JULY 1993 NUMBER 303 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL herself to the standard of care as required of him or her by professional colleagues? If there are no professional colleagues and if no such professional standards exist, then did the investigator show the standards a reasonable person would expect? If the answer to this question is \"no,\" then the court could find the investigator negligent, and thereby responsible for damages caused by such negligence. In this scenario, the specific charge would be that the investigator ought to have known the abductee was sub- ject to great emotional strain because of the experience. Through the investigation, he or she had opened a \"Pandora's box\" without knowing how to close it or control it, thus putting the experiencer at risk. T he paper argued, among other things, for a set of standards for abduction research and therapy — one which a court could consider because a large group of professionals had been concerned enough to examine the question. (The court would, however, not be obliged to accept these standards.) The debate propelled by the FMS Foundation is going to change the focus of the argument in abduction circles from the nature of the abduction phenomenon to the scientific and social responsibility of abduction re- searchers and therapists as they explore the question and try to identify and help experiencers. FMS raises le- gitimate concerns, with serious moral and ethical im- plications for the field of abductions. The concerns are worthy of study, even if we do not care for the way they are presented. FMS, and the issues it represents, is like a locomotive coming down the track, straight at us. The professionals on the advisory board of the FMS Foundation—pro- fessors of psychiatry, psychology, and sociology, in- cluding acknowledged experts in hypnosis and disso- ciative disorders—are prestigious, articulate and knowl- edgeable. Furthermore, the considerable force of con- sensus reality is behind them. We can use the knowledge and insight provided by this group to encourage a con- structive dialogue and improve our work, or we can fall into the trap of opposing FMS on the grounds that it is merely another \"debunking\" group. If we choose the latter course, we risk a backlash that could isolate ex- periencers even more than at present.

SURVEY - Continued from Page 11 As we all know, UFO abduction reports have re- cently received serious attention. Increasing numbers of psychotherapists say their patients report such abduc- tions, either spontaneously or under hypnosis, without showing any of the usual signs of delusional illness. This gives a disturbing new dimension to the UFO phe- nomenon because it represents a direct invasion into private lives. To clarify the problem we need good re- search. How widespread are these abduction reports? Who is making them? Are they explainable in terms of familiar principles of behavioral science (e.g., fantasy prone personality, epidemic hysteria, a known form of mental illness), or does their explanation require some- thing new? When research with obvious flaws is pub- lished, we lose credibility. Our fellow scientists say, \"So this is the kind of evidence you take seriously?\" A bad piece of research has the opposite of the intended ef- fect: it reinforces their prior opinion that the whole phe- nomenon is lacking in evidence and that people who take it seriously are simply being fools. All is not complete doom and gloom. As we men- tioned above, the survey results have been and are being used to interest qualified professionals in the abduction problem. That is a decided benefit of the survey. But as concerns the estimates of the prevalence of abduction, the money was ill-spent. Some information can be sal- vaged, though it will require, in part, another elaborate study to do so. The validity and reliability of all the items can be assessed after the fact, and if this is done, then the money spent on the survey will not have been wasted. To get any serious scientific attention, we have to do research that is above criticism: we must be purer than Caesar's wife. To get such attention, we have to de- serve it. Unfortunately, as evidence concerning the prevalence of abductions, this survey does not deserve serious attention.

Something that promises to pay large dividends for all of us who are seeking the truth about UFOs. One of these is Dan Wright's exciting proposal to establish a na- tional computer data base on UFO abduction cases. Let us explain why this is important. Although abduction reports are being made in record numbers, and are increasingly being taken seriously in the news media and professional circles, we know very little about what is going on. Actually we don't even know whether the reports are increasing, or only be- coming more visible. Despite the excellent work of major researchers and authors, we have no complete overview of tlie numbers, the substance, the frequency, or the distribution of ab- duction reports. Typical news media questions asked of researchers are: How many abduction reports are there in the U.S. or around the world? What is the most common description of the aliens? Is the phenomenon becoming more com- mon? Are there new trends in what is being reported? The honest answer to all these questions is, \"We don't know.\" Actually, we have no way of knowing because each researcher (no matter how many abductees he or she has interviewed) sees only part of the picture. And other than Eddie Bullard's catalogue of cases compiled over five years ago, no one has combined the information ob- tained by major researchers into a single large data base for study. Now, thanks to Dan Wright and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), a project is underway to lay the groundwork for a study of all the data available. A pro- posal for support of this project has been approved for funding by the National Board of the Fund for UFO Research. It is also endorsed by leading UFO re- searchers. The project involves transcription of hundreds and hundreds of audiotaped interviews and hypnotic re- gression sessions with abductees, and encoding of the data in a computer for retrieval and analysis. For the first time, we will have a sufficiently large computer data base to begin getting some answers to vitally important questions. Here's how it works. Cooperating abduction researchers (including Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, and John Carpenter) submit their audiotapes — or already completed transcripts — to Dan Wright. Dan has already organized and has in place a network of MUFON members who are skilled transcribers. They operate under a strict code of confidentiality and a quality control system. The tapes are transcribed, the transcripts archived by MUFON, and the tapes and a copy of the transcript returned to the researcher. This saves busy researchers a lot of time and money for transcription costs. And fur- thermore, MUFON even refunds the postage costs! This part of the program is well underway: tapes are now be- ing transcribed and the information compiled. The next step — a vital one — involves obtaining the computer equipment and a system to input all the de- scriptive information from the transcripts into the data base and to provide for its retrieval and study using standard indexing methods and analytical programs. The equipment would be maintained and operated by Dan, but would revert to MUFON for use elsewhere if for any reason he were unable to continue the program. As another step toward implementing the full pro- gram, MUFON recently contributed a laser-jet printer for Dan's use. Other equipment needed includes a com- puter powerful enough to handle large amounts of data and an optical character reader to accelerate input of the data. In order to process and analyze the information and make the results available to all researchers and to the public, however, we need contributions to acquire the necessary computer equipment. We hope to raise $3,000-$4,000 for the abduction data base program before the end of 1993. The Fund has already committed about $1,500 from contributions ear- marked for that purpose by contributors. That leaves only about $2,000 to go. Your tax-deductible contributions for this project can put it over the top, and you will be able to take pride in the accomplishment you have made possible. At last we will be on the road to learning more about the nature and meaning of UFO abductions. Fund for UFO Research Box 277 Mount Rainier, MD 20712 TRANSCRIPTION PROJECT UPDATE Kudos to John Carpenter for his \"Abduction Notes\" in- stallment in the April 1993 issue of the Journal (\"Reptilians and Other Unmentionables\"). John had the foresight to detail what is only now surfacing from the recesses of abduction research. Since last August, as coordinator of MUFON's Abduction Transcription Project involving John and nine other researchers, I've read and indexed abduc- tion related transcripts encompassing some 50 cases. Certain reported factors are supportive of John's re- marks. These include a) Multiple entity types estimated as 7+ feet in height and b) Blonde entities, one estimated as 6 feet tall, another as over 7 feet. Both were said to be quite-human looking, with thin, shoulder-length hair. JULY 1993 NUMBER 303 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL (Other subjects have mentioned extremely tall \"beauti- ful humans.\") Such reports nevertheless constitute only a fraction of all abduction cases reported in the U.S. As John point- edly asked, why do Britain and Europe have a higher in- cidence of this type of report compared to America? A few other unusual findings the project has uncov- ered: Among all entities perceived as 6 feet or taller, there is a grey (in charge of smaller greys) as well as a very tall black adjudged as female. John's assertion re- garding a reptilian is strikingly similar to various reports within the project of \"dark grey-green skin.\" Other ex- otic descriptions are \"ant,\" \"grasshopper,\" \"insect,\" \"lizard-like,\" \"praying mantis\" and \"reptile.\" In most ac- counts, such a type is regarded as \"the one in charge.\" Years ago, I learned firsthand of a subject being lev- itated through a closed door, an improbable aspect of an otherwise credible account. At this point in the tran- scription project, over a dozen separate subjects have re- ported having passed through a door, wall, window, ceiling or heating vent. John Carpenter amply demonstrated that we can never be smug in our supposed wisdom concerning how the various groupings of aliens look or act. That leads to perhaps the most vital questions of all: First, does each grouping of entity type cooperate with all other groupings? The findings to date suggest that they would benefit from a seminar on methods and behaviors: Many human subjects have endured great physical pain while onboard; for others, discomfort was minimized by a general numbing of the affected area. Some subjects related a compassionate environment; others described an unemotional or even menacing de- meanor adopted by their captors. Second, if the visitors indeed have contrasting moti- vations, what do our government officials know and have they taken sides? Some subjects have reported harrassment after an abduction event in the form of black unmarked helicopters, telephone taps, even drug injections. Are these the cruel efforts of our military to learn more about one entity type or another? Third, when civilian researchers ultimately discern the whole truth of the matter (assuming most or all govern- ments continue to stonewall), when and how do we in- form the rest of humanity? EVEN MORE URGENT By any measure, MUFON's Abduction Transcription Project, begun in August 1992, has been an enormous success thus far. Over 280 audiotapes involving CE-4 accounts have now been transcribed or are in the process of transcription as of this writing. But there is much, much more to be done. Our eleven abduction researchers involved in the project have far more hypnosis sessions and interviews in need of hard copy in order to isolate which entity types are doing what. MUFON members seriously interested in a long- term commitment to pursuing the truth in these strange encounters, but who are not actively engaged in local in- vestigations, should consider this opportunity. Expenses incurred are reimbursed by MUFON. Foremost, prospective transcribers must be absolutely committed to confidentiality of these sensitive materials. They must also have a standard audiotape player and earphones. Access to an IBM-compatible computer sys- tem is preferred, although a quality typewriter is ac- ceptable. Transcription of these sometimes harrowing sessions is not easy and is certainly time-consuming. The project needs people who have a burning need to learn more, who have considerable time to devote to it, and who can keep secrets. Interested persons should contact me at the address below. Their commitment might one day soon spell the difference between understanding and dismay in re- spect to the events yet to unfold. Dan Wright 117 W. South St. Morrice, Ml 48857 \"MISSING\" EMBRYOS/FETUSES In recent years numerous female abductees have re- lated that alien humanoids have intervened in the re- moval of an existing pregnancy, or have inseminated fe- males either directly or artificially: the so-called missing embryo/fetus syndrome. However, my research has yet to reveal one documented or verified case that would in- dicate such events are occurring. In putting out this memo to UFO researchers and in- vestigators alike, as well as to female abductees, I would like for them to submit the following information: Doctor's verification of pregnancy, medical records with ultrasound scan, D & C's, etc., to document that this has occurred. All information will be reviewed by a Blue Ribbon Panel Committee. I am offering $500 to any case that shows without a reasonable doubt that a female ab- ductee has had a missing pregnancy.

Although the idea wasn't original with him, it was von Daniken who ultimately gave the theme of the earth having once been visited by \"ancient astro- nauts\" its present currency and whatever urgency it may have. Of course von Daniken got some currency out of it, too, eventually selling some 50 million copies of his books worldwide. But it was Sitchin, a student of ancient history and languages trained in economics, who would lend the idea a verisimilitude of science and legitimacy. Where von Daniken was given to sweep- ing generalizations, Sitchin cited references and at- tached footnotes. What von Daniken made simply sen- sational, Sitchen made seem, if not wholly reasonable, at least remotely feasible. The first book of Sitchin's four-volume Earth Chronicles was The Twelfth Planet, first published in 1976 by Stein & Day, followed by The Stairway to Heaven, The Wars of Gods and Men. and The Lost Realms. Within the last year or two, all have been re- published in attractive, heavily-illustrated hardback edi- tions by Bear & Company Publishing of Santa Fe, New Mexico ($19.95 to $22.95 each). Anyone who had to squint through one of the small Avon paperback editions with their dingy illustrations will greatly appreciate the larger format of the new hardbacks. Sitchin's books also have the \"advantage\" of incor- porating another non-conventional theme — this one popularized by Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision — which holds that the present solar system is the result of a cosmic catastrophe that occurred mil- lions, if not billions, of years ago. Obviously, the scope of Sitchin's books can only be summarized here. To begin with, he postulates the existence of a 12th planet — referred to as both Marduk and Nibiru — circling the sun in a vast elliptical orbit which requires 3,600 years for its completion, or planetary \"year.\" At some point in the solar system's remote past, Marduk collided with a smaller planet, known as Tiamat, which broke into many parts. The largest of these became Earth; the other scat- tered fragments became the \"hammered Heaven\" of the Asteroid Belt. Tiamat's largest satellite, known to the an- cient Sumerians as Kingu, survived as our own moon; its smaller satellites were scattered as comets. So where did we come from? According to Sitchin, the organic molecules necessary for life originated on Marduk and were \"seeded\" here during the cosmic col- lision. Sitchin describes Marduk as a cometary-like planet that subsequently went on its way, returning to the near vicinity of the sun every 3,600 years. During its long night, Marduk generated its own heat, apparently via a radioactive core. Moreover, Sitchin believes \"hu- man\" life evolved on Marduk as little (or as much) as 450,000 years before it did on Earth. During one of its regular if infrequent orbits, the inhabitants of Marduk, the Nefilim, having developed space travel, landed on Earth and intervened in human evolution. Not surpris- ingly, the Nefilim were viewed by their primitive cousins as gods, if for no other reason than the fact that, having evolved on a planet where their year was 3600 of ours, they had gigantically long lifespans by comparison. A s much as we might appreciate the work and study that has gone into the research and writing of Sitchin's voluminous Earth Chronicles, we do no one any favors by overlooking some serious scientific prob- lems such a fantastic scenario entails. Whether Marduk is a warmblooded planet or not, it simply makes no sense that intelligent life would evolve on its surface be- fore it would on the planet Earth, given that Marduk spends the overwhelming majority of its \"year\" in deep space in almost total darkness. The internally gener- ated heat source that Sitchin proposes — heat necessary to keep Marduk's oceans, indeed its very atmosphere, from freezing solid — would almost certainly endanger any simple organic molecules necessary for life, not to mention vastly complicating the evolution of the latter into increasingly complex, intelligent organisms capable of space travel. Human life on Earth depends almost to- tally on — among other highly interactive factors — the complicated chemical process of photosynthesis, which in turn depends on our planet's \"comfort zone\" prox- imity to the sun and its inundating light. How plants could evolve, thrive and survive on Marduk is, quite frankly, beyond the imagination and resources of this re- viewer. Sitchin makes the equally presumptive and implau- sible assumption that because life evolved on a planet with a 3600-year orbital frequency about the sun, then its \"human\" inhabitants would necessarily live 3600 times as long as humans who evolved on a planet with an or- bital frequency of only one year, or 365 days. It goes without saying that humans are hardly the only life- forms to have evolved on this planet. A quick glance at any lifescale chart reveals a bewildering variety of or- ganisms living from several hours or days, to as many as a hundred years or more in the case of certain animals, to hundreds or thousands of years in the case of some plants. The time it takes a ball of mud and water to cir- cle the sun, in other words, has no appreciable effect on, or relation to, the lifespan of individual species which evolved on that planet. If there is any such magical marker or overriding determinant in terms of the lifespan of individual organisms or species, it would probably JULY 1993 NUMBER 303 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL have much more to do with basic metabolism rates than anything else. Sitchin bases his own theory on an ancient Babylonian clay tablet cuneiform text known as the \"Epic of Creation.\" It's not always clear how his inter- pretation of this text is meant to be taken. Sometimes he treats it as mere theory; other times he relies on it almost as if it were an eyewitness account of events, although obviously no one would have been alive at the time, or survived the subsequent cataclysm. On occasion, it's treated almost as if it were divine revelation, a dens ex machina which Sitchin's own theories otherwise negate by definition. T hat the Sitchin corpus is crammed with esoteric erudition and thought-provoking statements, no one denies; on the other hand, thought provoked is not always truth revealed. And the assertions of an histori- an, linguist and economist, however accomplished, shouldn't necessarily be accepted as those of a chemist, biologist or cosmologist, let alone all three. In his own areas of expertise Sitchin is stimulating and has a lot to say (he's a much more accomplished and entertaining writer than von Daniken), but that shouldn't blind us to his other overreaching (and unsubstantiated) assumptions. Life on this planet is not inextricably linked to the length of time it takes to circumnavigate the central sun of the solar system, nor is there any reason to believe that life lives longer the further out from the sun it arises or revolves. Certainly there is no reason to believe that the planet Marduk, environmentally stressed by its descent into the depths of sub-freezing (and sunless) deep space, should have evolved intelligent life any sooner than its closer counterpart. We, at least, had the sun and its inpour- ing, relatively clean, energy at our disposal; Sitchin can only propose a mythical planet heated by its own internal radioactive nuclear fuel pile as the original source of intelligent life in the solar system, one which would presumably have to switch on an equally effective radioactive air-conditioning and cooling sys- tem during its closest \"annual\" approach to the sun. That ordered intelligent life would have first evolved under such extremely fluctuating conditions — as opposed to the relatively stable and fixed ones affect- ing Earth — is wishful supposition to put it mildly, Sitchin might as well argue that organic molecules arose and evolved everywhere. If it happened on Marduk, then why not on Mars, Venus or Pluto? In other words, why would Earth need to be seeded from an outside source? There is also the significant issue of gravity which Sitchin fails to address head-on. If the legendary Marduk was large enough to smash Tiamat into its constituent parts — of which our planet was but the largest — then its gravitational force field must be considerably greater than Earth's by several orders of magnitude. Again it's hard to visualize how intelligent beings capable of space travel would (or could) have evolved under such physical restrictions. By all that humans hold logical, we should be colonizing the mythical Marduk rather than the other way around. And perhaps we will—in another 3600 years or so. If Marduk is populated, it will be up to our own astro- nauts to convince its inhabitants that we aren't gods, an obligation which shouldn't be all that difficult to fulfill. In the meantime, Sitchin has written two other books on related themes: Genesis Revisited (Is Modern Science Catching up with Ancient Knowledge?) and* most re- cently, the fifth book of the Earth Chronicles series When Time Began (The First New Age), from Avon. They do make for wonderful reading, but then so does the Bible. Whether the texts on which they are based are meant to to be taken literally or allegorically (or scien- tifically) is of course another matter of controversy al- together.

THE ALLAGASH ABDUCTIONS We premiered an excerpt from this new book by Raymond Fowler, MUFON's Director of Investigations, in the April 1993 issue of the Journal. As you may re- member, the case concerns four young art students from Boston who were canoeing along Maine's Allagash River when they collectively experienced an elaborate abduction encounter. On May 6, all four appeared on the Joan Rivers show. Wild Flower press advises that The Allagash Abductions is now available in both hardcover ($23.95) and quality trade paperback ($16.95) editions.

Unless noted, no sound, vibration, or odor was detected. All times are local. Submitted by Regional Directors Donald Ware (E) Eastern, George Coyne (C) Central, and Robert Gribble (W) Western. • Log #930507E: On September 11, 1992 at 6:20 p.m., while pulling into her driveway in Gulf Breeze, FL a lady was startled by a car-sized object ascending from her back yard 200 feet away; investigators, Bland Pugh, Bruce Morrison, and David Holcomb. The bottom appeared circular with a glowing ring in the center. It had a dome on top, and appeared burnished gray with a pink stripe. It flipped upside down, moved over some pine trees and just \"popped\" out, all in about three seconds. A Schondtedt Model GA 52 magnetic de- tector registered a strong reading from these tree tops that gradually faded out over about four days. Three circular areas, devoid of vegetation, were found on the bottom of a 3-4 foot deep pond where the UFO was first seen ascending. The cir- cles measured 9' 10\", 10' 9\", and 11' 8\" in diameter. The wit- ness knows someone in Franklin County, MS who later re- ported a UFO that behaved in a similar manner and left a mag- netic trace in Sweet Gum trees. • Log #930508E: On January 9, 1993 at about 7 p.m. a mid- dle-aged man was sky watching alone in the Big Sabine area of Pensacola Beach, FL, when a pulsating white light ap- peared in the east, hovering; investigator, Bland Pugh. He felt ill and lowered his head \"for about two minutes.\" When he raised up, it was gone, so he sat in his vehicle for about 20 minutes until his strength returned. He said he felt sleepy and did a lot of yawning, which was not his nature, then went to Shoreline Park South in Gulf Breeze where he and friends in the research team found a strange puncture wound on the back of his hand. It was a 1-1/2 inch circle of seven points with a point in the center. Over a week later, when it didn't heal, he went to the doctor. The doctor later told him of a lady in Gulf Breeze with a similar mark acquired under strange circumstances. The investigator also knows two other people who acquired similar marks under very strange cir- cumstances soon after this event. • Log #9Z0503E: On April 23, 1991, at 8:30 p.m. a man and his wife, both age 43, saw a round glowing object as they drove home in Plaistow, NH; investigator Cheryl Powell. The object had a hazy horizontal ring around the middle, and it hovered, ascended, descended, turned abruptly, fluttered and wobbled once. It was seen several times in the next four hours by the couple and several police officers from Plaistow and Atkinson. Once it appeared to land, but then suddenly as- cended when the officers tried to find it. They declined to sub- mit a report, but verbally supported the couple's description. • Log #920504E: On March 6, 1991, at 3 a.m. a lady in bed watched a moon-sized, red/yellow oval cross her 8-foot-wide window in six seconds; investigator Vail Leach, Illinois. She said it was as bright as the sun and filled the room with light. It was in a shallow descent in front of a mountain 3 miles dis- tant, but there was no sign it contacted the ground. • Log #930305E: November 19, 1992, at 6:30 a.m. a silver flying saucer hovered three feet above the road in front of two General Electric employees near Moscow, ME; investigator, Arnold Dunning. They were on their way to work at an over- the-horizon radar site when it flew in rapidly and blocked their path. They stopped 12 feet from it. It was 25-30 feet in di- ameter and 15 feet high with green lights around the edge. After 20 seconds, it just disappeared. A hunter nearby also re- ported seeing a strange light in the sky at that time. • Log #930309E: In the fall of 1988, a 42-year-old man saw balls of light a few inches in diameter several times near Delaware City, DE that sometimes appeared to react to him; investigator, Hugh B. Horning. One amber ball followed a C- 130. Three amber balls, side-by-side, followed a white ball. One ball stopped over his truck and blinked on and off. Then a white ball about 200-300 feet away traced the outline of a tree that was 50 feet away. This was only meaningful from his position. In September, 1988, in the same area, he saw two aluminum-colored disks, tilted about 20° up, cross 90° of sky in about ten seconds. They each appeared 1/2 inch wide at arm's length. One night in October 1988, from his third- floor window, he saw a flat oval of white and yellow/gold light, perhaps 400 feet long and 100 feet high, move slowly down a canal and disappear, as if passing behind an unseen object. He drove down there, but there were no ships in sight. In early November at 3:00 p.m., from the same location, he saw a flat, charcoal-gray, circular craft (like a giant tire on its side with dark hub caps) slightly wobbling about 100 feet above the water half a mile away. It appeared about 3 inches in diameter and 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick at arm's length. After about 15 seconds, the object faded out \"like a picture on a TV going to static and then going off.\" • Log #930302E: On March 19, 1959 at 1 a.m., a 23-year- old seminary student had four hours of missing time after en- countering a Saturn-shaped UFO at Our Lady of Grace Monastery in Colebrook, NH; investigator, Morton Schafer. The silvery object drew near and retreated from him and his now-deceased brother three times. They could see lighted windows around the lower portion and blinking red, yellow and green lights on the outer rim. It was as large as a baseball diamond, and emitted a low hum like bees flying. In 1992, during four taped sessions, the following events were re- membered. The craft landed on three legs as all surrounding noises ceased. Onboard, they were told not to be frightened and instructed to remove their clothing. They saw four hu- manoids who used telepathy to communicate. The six-foot-tall leader was much larger than the others. An examination in- volved intrusion into all of the body openings with special at- tention to the mouth and throat. Semen was extracted by sy- ringe and wands that were guided over their bodies. He was given a green liquid to drink. He felt some G forces. They ar- rived at a \"mother ship\" where many other UFOs were seen to come and go. Further tests were performed. Other humans were there. The host demonstrated how they absorbed a paste- like food through their skin. The beings smelled like moist soil. They were asked not to tell others about their experience. JULY 1993 NUMBER 303 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL When they did they were met with ridicule. There was evi- dence of a strange clear substance flaking off their bodies the next day, and body temperature seemed to be increased. There were also signs of other encounters before and after that day. • Log #930403E: About September 23, 1962 at 10 p.m., a 26-year-old seminary student, while driving on Hwy 3 near Old Man of the Mountain, NH, had two hours of missing time involving the same UFO he encountered 3 and 1/2 years ear- lier; investigator, Mort Schafer. When he got out of his truck a blue shaft of light reached the ground in front of him. Without hesitation, he entered the beam and was elevated into the craft. Three aliens greeted him with outstretched hands. The same \"old man\" he met in 1959 was in control. A description of controls was given. He observed two entities go down a blue beam to another car that was stopped, and the oc- cupants taken to separate rooms. After an examination they were escorted back to their car and immediately drove on. He was told that noise in the vicinity was in an altered state of suspension, and even time was altered. He was taken to a larger UFO as before, where he saw hundreds of aliens of dif- ferent age groups, but no babies. He was told their primary needs are our minds, spirit and soul. They could produce bodies, but not souls. After leaving the mothership, his next recollection was of arriving at Lancaster, NH in his truck. This is 45 miles from where he was picked up. • Log #930406E: On May 19, 1992 at about 3 a.m., a 28- year-old machinist and his wife observed from their living room window a ball of yellowish-white light move through their neighborhood in Londondary, NH; investigator, Ken Foster. It came from the left across .the backyards of the houses across the street, dropped below the treetops in a zig- zag pattern and moved off to the right through the trees. On June 5, 1992 they saw a similar ball of light rise vertically from behind the same trees, go left, then right, stop, right then left and finally move out of sight. The day before this sighting at 4:15 a.m. the husband said he saw, in the same area, a 40- foot-long rectangular object with a vertical protrusion, a red light across the bottom, and a red and a blue spot glowing on the side. A low hum was heard. After about 10 seconds it went behind the trees. • Log #930407E: On October 27, 1992 at 3:25 a.m. a 36- year-old chemical operator and a co-worker saw the lights on what appeared to be a boomerang-shaped object fly low and slow over Williamsport, PA; investigator, Mike Cassidy. It had a steady white light at the leading .point and five blinking red lights on each \"wing\". It appeared to be larger than a bas- ketball at arm's length and was estimated to be 1000 feet away. It was reported to be 400 to 500 feet above the ground, and it moved out of sight in about five minutes. This sighting occurred several blocks from the noisy boomerang display of February 5, 1992. • Log #930502E: On October 27. 1992 at 3:20 a.m. a truck driver saw a large vee-shaped object hovering 300 feet above the ground after it activated his radar detector on Hwy 220 near Glen Mawr, PA; investigator, Samuel D. Greco, Ph.D. He stopped and got out as it hovered about 1000 yards from him. It was about 250 feet long, 200 feet wide and 50 feet thick at the nose of the vee. There was a large white light un- der the nose and four blinking red lights evenly spaced down each \"wing\". He felt strange, like he \"was a different person.\" Then the white lights turned off, and it moved directly over him before turning west and departing at 20 to 30 mph. (Five minutes later and 20 some miles southwest a similar object was seen — Case #930407E. DMW) Also, the truck driver said he knew of seven other people who saw a UFO later that morning. • Log #930505E: In October 1990 at 9:30 p.m. two boys, ages 11 and 9, were playing in a bowling alley parking lot in Little Falls, NY when a large triangular object approached, de- scended, and hovered over them at tree-top level; investigator, Keith Conroy. It was about six car-lengths long, and city lights reflected off its dark surface. A circular \"window\" centered on the bottom showed light inside. One of the boys hid under a car. It made a whistling sound as it flew away and then disappeared. The sighting only lasted about 30 seconds. After it departed, they said the Little Falls police came on the scene and asked if they had seen anything unusual in the sky. They said yes, and the officers sped after it. • Log #930506E: On May 21, 1990 at about 9:00 p.m. a family of four, ages 23 to 50, observed a large triangular ob- ject the size of a house hover about 60 feet above them near Trenton, NY; investigator, Keith Conroy. It had three round white lights on the bottom near each corner and a \"landing\" light on the front. Also reported were \"lines\" or \"swirling streams\" of light on the center of the bottom. Three wit- nesses reported a faint low hum, while one remembered it as a \"rushing\" sound. It moved at walking speed and some- times appeared to jump from one place to another. It stayed in the area for about two hours. • Log #921009: About 6:50 a.m., on September 10, 1992, a 30-year-old woman observed an apparent solid UFO while driving to work on one of the main freeways in Honolulu, HI; investigator, Michael Brein, Ph.D., State Director. At first she thought the device was a helicopter, but as it moved closer just above the freeway, she noticed that it appeared to be a hexag- onally-shaped, solid object, dull aluminum gray in color, about the size of two helicopters. The witness was quite in- sistent that the object was definitely neither a helicopter nor any other conventional object. It moved in a relatively straight line directly above (about 500 feet), and along the freeway at approximately 50 mph. Traffic was moving along very slowly and, to her apparent surprise, nobody else seemed to be pay- ing any attention to the object. The UFO moved further along the freeway and out of sight.

UNITED NATIONS VIDEO On October 2, 1992. a UFO presentation was made to the Parapsychology Society and interested UN of- ficials in the Dag Hammarskjold Auditorium at the United Nations in New York City to reopen Decision GA33/426 previously enacted by the General Assembly on December 18. 1978. MUFON has pro- duced a video tape depicting the most significant as- pects of this important meeting. The two-hour VMS video tape is composed of the opening and closing remarks of Mohammad A. Ramadan (Egypt). \"The Cosmic Watergate: Basic Facts\" by Stanton T. Friedman. M.S., \"Medical and Scientific Evidence\" by John F. Schuessler, M.S., and \"An Open Letter to the Secretary-General and the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space\" by Robert H. Bletchman. J.D. The latter three speakers are all members of MUFON's Board of Directors. MUFON has initially ordered 500 copies of this monumental UN presentation to be made available im- mediately. Orders may be placed by mailing a Postal Money Order or personal check made payable through a U.S. bank for $19.95 plus $2 for postage and han- dling to MUFON. 103 Oldtownc Road, Secuin.

The much fainter Mars is very low in the W at dusk, setting about 1 - 1/2 hours after sunset. Conspicuous Jupiter can be seen somewhat higher and sets within half an hour after its dim ruddy companion. The lunar crescent forms a triangle with the pair on the 20th. Saturn (0.3), in Aquarius, rises in the E at sunset on August 19 opposite the Sun and remains visible all night. Earth has overtaken all 6 outer planets in the past 8 months, and all can be seen in the southern evening sky (several requiring tele- scopic aid). From W to E. they are Mars and Jupiter (in Virgo), Pluto (Libra). Uranus and Neptune (Sagittarius), and Saturn. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-4.0) rises in the NE about 3 AM in midmonth. The radiant object gleams low in the E at dawn. The crescent Moon is nearby on the 14th and 15th. Saturn, near opposition and therefore at its brightest, advances across the southern sky during the night, setting in the W about sunrise. Mars Observer: The Mars Observer spacecraft enters Mars orbit on August 24 to begin a detailed survey of our neighbor planet. Observer will watch this intriguing world over an entire Martian year (2 Earth years). Studies include weather, atmosphere, dust- storms, surface composition, and camera imagery. Scientific mapping of the planet, however, doesn't begin until December. Some researchers hope that the puzzling ''face on Mars\" will be photographed again, although NASA doesn't guarantee that this will be done. Meteor Shower: Once again this year the Perseids should be closely monitored on the night of August 11-12, since the proximity of the me- teor shower's parent comet Swift-Tuttle, created dramatic Perseid displays in 1992 and 1991. Although the comet is now leaving our vicinity, watchers should still observe the sky for a sharp peak, possibly around 1 1 PM or midnight on the 1 1th (up to 200 meteors or more per hour?), and then continue to scan the heavens through the morning hours of the 12th. The quarter Moon will be a complicating factor, interfering somewhat during the morning. (Perseid meteors in lesser numbers are visible before and after these dates.) Moon Phases: Full moon — August 2 Last quarter — August 10 New moon—August 17 First quarter—August 24 Full moon—August 31 Two full moons in one month. Second full moon called a \"blue moon.\" Last time this occurred was Dec. 1990: next time June 1996.

PAGE 22 NUMBER 303 JULY 1993"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE - Continued from Page 24 Congratulations are extended to all three candidates for volunteering to serve in this capacity. Mr. Coyne will moderate the State/Provincial Director's meeting at Richmond, VA on Friday, July 2, 1993, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. REMOVAL OF BOARD MEMBER The MUFON Board of Directors has the authority to elect people to the Board through a mail ballot. Conversely, the same authority may be applied to the re- moval of present Board members who continually defy the corporate goals and objectives of the Mutual UFO Network to the detriment of MUFON's scientific cred- ibility. In an unprecedented election, Donald M. Ware was voted to be removed from the Board effective June 1, 1993. This action stemmed from continued advisory statements by members of the Executive Committee to Don that he refrain from mailing books to Board mem- bers and Eastern Regional State Directors espousing \"channeling\" philosophies and techniques over a two- year period. As a result of Mr. Ware's fascination with channeling as a means of communicating with aliens or entities, he invited Dr. Norma Milanovich, a professed channeler, to attend the closed MUFON \"Face-to-Face\" meeting in Albuquerque, NM in July 1992 and allowed her to read her channeled answers to the questions posed for dis- cussion by the participants. Much to the shock and dis- may of MUFON officers attending, Dr. Milanovich read the answers from a computer print-out which she claims was obtained from \"Master Kuthumi\" during a 33-minute period the previous night. Walter Andrus gave Donald Ware an opportunity to resign from the Board. After he refused to resign, a vote by the Board of Directors was felt to be the fairest way of determining his status. Since it has taken 25 years to establish MUFON's scientific credibility, it seems unwise to allow one individual's unscientific in- terests to be taken as representative of those of MUFON. The results from the mail ballot are as follows: 15 (65.2%) voted yes to remove; four (17.4%) voted no to removal, and four directors abstained as the third choice. MUFON is indebted to Don for the outstanding job he performed as a Field Investigator, State Section Director. State Director and later as MUFON's Eastern Regional Director. Any member of MUFON may study any of the fringe aspects of Ufology such as channeling and the New Age concepts, however, MUFON does not endorse these fringe aspects and is strictly against any member's attempt to proselytize other MUFON members. Channelers have produced no scientific evi- dence, thus far, that is applicable to resolving the UFO phenomenon. The removal of Mr. Ware from the Board was a difficult and painful decision and he will be sorely missed. Eastern Region State Directors should discontinue sending UFO sighting reports to Mr. Ware and instead mail them to Jerold \"Ron\" Johnson, MUFON Deputy Director of Investigations, 12700 Silver Creek, Austin, TX 78727, until such time as a new Eastern Regional Director is elected. EASTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR ELECTION Candidates are being solicited immediately to complete the one-year term remaining for Mr. Ware on the Board of Directors. Interested individuals should also take into consideration the possibility of running for reelec- tion for a full four-year term in 1994. This is an oppor- tunity for present State directors, and other leaders to ac- cept greater responsibilities within MUFON. The Eastern Region is composed of the following states: ME, VT, NH, MA, CT, RI, NY. PA, NJ, DE, MD, WV, VA, NC, SC, GA, and FL. Regional Directors are elected by the members within the above states. Any in- terested and qualified person is encouraged to submit their name to Walt Andrus in Seguin as a candidate for this vacancy by August 15, 1993, so an election may be conducted by mail. NORTHERN UFO NEWS When I was announcing the 300th consecutive issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, I inadvertently made the statement that no other UFO magazine has approached even half of the 300 issues. Jenny Randies has been edit- ing the Northern UFO News for 20 years and proudly sent her 160th issue dated April 1993, which is obvi- ously greater than 150. She not only politely corrected your Director, but congratulated MUFON upon hav- ing reached the big three hundred. My apologies to Jenny. An annual subscription to the Northern UFO News (bi-monthly) may be obtained by sending the equivalent of seven English pounds to 37 Heathbank Road, Cheadle Heath, Stockport Cheshire SK3 OUP, England.

Candidates may live anywhere in the world and do not have to be members of the Mutual UFO Network to be nominated for this prestigious award.

All nominations must be received in Seguin, Texas, by September 1, 1993. It is recommended that members in foreign countries use airmail for their nom- inations.

Tilly, Director of Public Education, has an- nounced that the 1993 National UFO Information Week has been scheduled for August 14 through 22. 1993. Recognizing that considerable work is required to build photo exhibits for display purposes the time is growing short to start planning local activities for shopping malls, public libraries, etc., for this year. Popular exhibits are closed-circuit UFO video programs, UFO information hand-outs and a table to interview people reporting UFO experiences. MUFON 1993 SYMPOSIUM The 24th Annual MUFON International UFO Symposium in Richmond, Virginia, was successful be- yond all expectations thanks to the enthusiastic atten- dees, but especially to the host committee for their cor- diality and attention to details.
