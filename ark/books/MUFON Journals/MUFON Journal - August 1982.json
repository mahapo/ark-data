Monday, July 5th, was set aside as a UFO Summit Conference Day in which numerous proposals were made to promote international co- operation and to establish UFOlogy as a legitimate scientific discipline with accepted methodology and standard- ized data-gathering techniques (see separate article by Walt Andrus). The majority of the papers, presented addressed various political and sociological problems confronting, contemporary UFOlogy. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, for example, spoke on the question of \"Preparing For the Next UFO Flap.\" At least two speakers, however, looked to the natural and technological consequences of Close Encounters. The abstract of Dr. Michael A. Persinger's paper, \"Predicting UFO Events and Experiences,\" follows. \"A comprehensive theory is presented that may be helpful for predicting the characteristics of most UFO events and experiences. The theory, which contains three components, assumes: (1) UFO patterns are generated by processes associated with earthstress: (2) The individual UFO event is an intense electromagnetic-like manifestation of this strain; (3) The rich imagery and consistent themes of close encounter experiences reflect the direct interference of those electromagnetic fields with the human brain. Numerical tests of the first component and qualitative predictions for the second and third components are briefly discussed.\" By means of computer analysis, Persinger found a \"conspicuous and robust\" correlation between the number of UFO reports and the number of seismic events within a particular region such as the New Madrid Fault Line in the central eastern Westbury Hotel, Toronto symposium site United States. Using a 6-month time window either side of peaks of known seismic activity, Persinger found that UFO events tend to cluster in the frame preceding the release of tectonic strain. \"And the more intense the quakes; the Jonger the time it is preceded by luminous displays.\" \"When the observer is very close to the UFO event, the correlated EM- like fields (1) modify the electrical activity of the observer's brain, and (2) evoke the close encounter experience.\" Neurophysiological studies in which the brain is modified or stimulated directly, reveal that the patient experiences such modification as a real event. The human body, as a field perceptor, responds in different ways to different fields. Electrical fields typically evoke sensation along the top of the cranium and neck, while response to magnetic fields is localized on the top of the shoulders and in the gonadal and ovarial areas. ELF fields induce changes in the brain itself. The temporal lobe, because it is least protected by the cranium itself, responds easiest of any brain area to electrical stimulation. Artificial excitation of the temporal lobe in the laboratory results in the mind being swamped with vivid imagery it cannot control, an intense, dream-like experience. Other immediate temporal lobe effects include sensations of deja- vu, depersonalization or vertigo; prominent vestibular sensations, such as a feeling of moving up or down; auditory experiences in which hearing is equated with knowing; and increased feelings of meaningfulness in general. Subsequent temporal lobe dysfunction and after-effects may involve confusion and disoriented behavior, time-loss, partial or total amnesia, the incorporation of post- espisodic information as a part of the perceived experience, and physical symptoms such as malaise, headaches, nausea, exhaustion, and inappropriate emotions.

John F. Schuessler of NASA, MUFON Deputy Director, gave an update of the Betty Cash, Vickie and Colby Landrum UFO close encounter which occurred near Houston, Texas, the night of December 29, 1980. All three primary witnesses suffered severe, and in some cases continuing, medical effects as a result of their experience. The extent of physical damage seemed to be directly proportional to the length of time the individual was exposed to the UFO source. On the night in question, Betty, 51, Vickie, 57, and her grandson, Colby, aged 7, were returning by automobile to their Dayton, Texas, home. Through thick pine trees lining the road they could see a brilliant light which soon resolved itself as a diamond-shaped UFO, \"as big as a water tank,\" hovering over the highway ahead. Ringed by blue lights, the UFO slowly rose and settled, occasionally emitting a cone-shaped funnel of fire out of its lower end. Betty Cash, who was driving, stopped the car approximately 150 feet away and all three got out. Colby quickly got back in, followed by his grandmother. Betty stood beside the car for a period of from 5 to 10 minutes. When she finally re- entered, the door-handle was so hot she had to use a corner of her leather coat like a hot pad. The brilliantly glowing UFO finally drifted away over the tops of the pine trees, but not alone: approximately 25 helicopters had now swarmed on the scene of two, and possibly three, types; Positive identification of CH-47, or \"Chinook,\" helicopters, the large, double-rotary variety, was made later in meetings with Schuessler and other members of the Houston-based VISIT (Vehicle Internal-Systems Investigative Team) group. VISIT, composed largely of fellow NASA personnel, attempts to extrapolate UFO mechanisms and technology from their residual physical effects. Walt Andrus, MUFOIM International Director Symposium audience Less than an hour after the encounter, Betty Cash already was suffering a severe headache, nausea, swelling of the neck, and red blotches on her face and head. Over the next 4 days her health continued to deteriorate to the point where she required hospitalization. The headaches continued, her eyes swelled completely shut, the red splotches turned into blisters filled with clear fluid, and she became ill with nausea and diarrhea. She was admitted to the hospital, where she remained for 12 days. Her hair began to fall out in clumps. As an out patient she showed little improvement and was soon readmitted to spend another 15 days under surveillance. Both Vickie and Colby Landrum suffered similar, if less drastic, symptoms. Vickie, perhaps because of her age, experienced sores on her hands and arms that were slow to heal. Like Betty, she experienced hair loss and eventual regrowth of a different texture, erythema, or reddening of the skin, as if from sunburn, diarrhea, headache, loss of appetite, and (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Symposium, Continued photophthalmia. Young Colby also reported erythema, photophthalmia, stomach cramps and diarrhea, anorexia, and a dramatic increase in tooth cavities. Because the witnesses were reluctant to report the cause of their injuries, doctors ran no special tests, such as blood analyses, that might have determined radiation exposure type and duration. All three victims appear, however, to have been exposed to a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including microwave, X- and gamma rays, and ultraviolet radiation. Although investigation continues, efforts by Schuessler and VISIT to trace the origin of the large cluster of helicopters have proved fruitless. Betty Cash and Vickie Landrum are convinced the \"UFO\" was some secret military exercise and indeed the theory was put forth that a Harrier Vertical Take-Off type aircraft might have been engaged in an electronic- countermeasure exercise with accompanying helicopters. But the United States has only a small complement of Harriers, operated by the Marine Corps, and all of these have been accounted for. Still, the witnesses are seeking legal action against the United States Government, employing New York Attorney Peter Gersten, of CAUS (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy). Another update of a continuing UFO landmark case investigation was provided by William L. Moore, co- author with Charles Berlitz, of The Philadelphia Experiment and The Roswell Incident. The latter book concerns itself with the alleged crash and subsequent U.S. military retrieval of a damaged flying saucer, perhaps with bodies aboard, near Roswell, New Mexico, on or about July 2,1947. A new book, The Roswell Evidence, is scheduled for publication in the fall of 1983. Recently, Moore's investigations have centered around the activities and whereabouts of top level government, scientific, and military officials immediately following the alleged crash date and the subsequent cover-up by U.S. Army Air Force personnel. Among the activities of those Moore, John Schuessler, MUFOIM Deputy Director Len Stringfield talks with registrants at reception nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman, and researcher Nic Magnuson investigated were President Harry Truman, Generals Curtis LeMay, Carl Spaatz, Jimmy Doolittle, Nathan Twining, and Hoyt Vandenburg, Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson, and leading American scientist at the time, Dr. Vannevar Bush, Chairman of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). Such a study was undertaken, because, according to Moore, \"if General Vandenburg was out playing golf with his Aide-de-Camp, then we've got a problem.\" Instead, Moore and the other investigators found a series'of what he called \"generals meeting with generals, generals meeting with the Secretary of the AAF, and generals meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, . actions consistent among high officials with what would have been expected had a crashed saucer been retrieved.\" A letter from Dr. Bush's personal secretary to General Spaatz, for example, dated July 17, 1947, indicated that he was \"away\" and would not return until September. Exactly a week (continued on next page) 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Symposium, Continued after his return Bush met with James Forrestal, the new Secretary of Defense, and President Truman in the White House. Subsequently, Bush was appointed Chairman of the newly established Research and Develop- ment Board of the National Military Establishment. The hastily withdrawn press release announcing that the AAF had in its possession a crashed disc had been made at noon, July 8, 1947, datelined Roswell. The following day General James H. Doolittle and General Hoyt Vandenburg met with Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington. The topic of discussion was not a part of the public record. The same threesome then met with General Norstad and Army Chief of Staff, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, in the latter's office. Shortly before noon, Vandenburg met again with Symington and the two men then attended a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. As Moore details it, the list goes on and on, and more information may yet surface. The importance of it all, from his point of view, is that such feverish activity tends to corroborate the crash- retrieval whereas an absence of same \"would have indicated that no one cared, that nothing out of the ordinary had taken place.\" Moore also suggests that a high level top-secret organization was initiated soon after the Roswell Incident and continues in operation today, despite U.S. Air Force disclaimers of interest in UFO phenomena following the closure of Project Blue Book in December of 1969. Moore learned, for example, that an agency known as Airways Communication Service (AACS) had existed in the early 1950's under the aegis of the Defense Communication Agency (DCA). AACS personnel relayed UFO reports directly to two people in the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), later the Military Airlift Command (MAC). These files were subsequently transferred to the AF department of Foreign Technology under the Office of Special Investigations (OSI). Efforts made by Stanton Friedman under the Freedom of Information Act to trace the whereabouts of said files 6 Dennis Stacy, left, with Larry Bryant of Citizens Against UFO Secrecy have been systematically and officially thwarted, according to Moore, who then adduced a copy of an OSI central headquarters letter dated December 9, 1981, and addressed to all 168 of its field offices. Subject: one Stanton T. Friedman. Heads of all field offices were directed to disregard the official procedure outlined under the Freedom of Information Act and advised that \"special procedure (as outlined in letter) is in effect until further notice.\" Moore then displayed another document, self-censored, dated within the last 2 years, which said \"the official AF policy towards UFOs is top secret and its dissemination restricted to those with appropriate access.\" In conclusion, Moore asked the audience, \"Is this a cover-up? Am I repeating hearsay or is this clearly an official document?\" Arthur Bray of Ottawa spoke on \"Professionalism in UFOIogy.\" He is Manager, Occupational Section, Canada Safety Council; a retired naval Lieutenant Commander; and author of numerous UFO articles and two books, Science, the Public and UFOs (1967), and The UFO Connection (1979). He previously taught a UFO course at Algonquin College, Ottawa, and in 1969 delivered a lengthy brief on UFOs to the Special Senate Committee on Science Policy. \"In ufology,\" said Bray, \"there is a great tendency to ignore new leads and new ideas because they do not 'fit in' with our current beliefs or theories. Yet this is precisely one of the sins which we accuse the scientific establishment of committing.\" By way of example, he pointed to the work of Trevor James Constable and the American newspaper reporter, Frank Scully. Constable had gained some notoriety because of his claims of being able to photograph so-called space creature-UFOs, or \"critters,\" using infrared film. \"It is time,\" Bray argued, \"fellow ufologists try duplicating Constable's work for themselves instead of rejecting it out of hand as fantastic or impossible.\" Frank Scully first made sensational headlines in 1950 with the publication of Behind the Flying Saucers, which alleged that a crashed flying disc along with its occupants had been recovered by the United' States military. Bray himself uncovered data reported by the late Wilbur B. Smith, a leading Canadian ufologist, which tended to support Scully's story. With new evidence about the Roswell crash being uncovered almost daily by William Moore and Stanton Friedman, he suggested it was time Scully's book was re-examined in a more professional and objective light. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Symposium, Continued \"This brings me to another area of professionalism,\" Bray added, \"the book reviewers, or opinion-makers, as they could be called.\" Citing reviews by other UFOlogists highly critical of his own books, Bray said a more even- handed approach was needed. He was not referring to the elimination of valid criticism per se, but to attitudes of sweeping \"self-righteousness and infallibility. In ufology, particularly where we have so few answers, who is to say who is ultimately right and who is wrong?\" In summary, he suggested four areas of approach that could help raise the level of professionalism in contemporary ufology: .(1) Following Dr. Hynek's lead, a professional organization, separate from research organizations, so as to avoid any conflict of interest,.should be established to promote a set of standards and ethics for all UFOIogy to abide by. (2) Book-reviewing should be conducted in a fair, objective, and unbiased manner. (3) Courtesy should be displayed at all times in our .relationships with fellow researchers. (4) All new leads, from whatever source, should be pursued vigorously until the truth of the matter is known. Dr. George Owen and his wife, Iris, both respected parapsychologists, addressed \"paranormal\" aspects of UFOIogy. They co-direct the Psychical Research Center and the Center for UFO Research in Toronto. Dr. Owen is presently a .Professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Toronto. He is the author of the classic Can We Explain the Poltergeist? and a biography of J.M. Charcot, Hysteria, .Hypnosis and Healing. Iris Owen is active in children's social welfare work and the co-author of Conjuring Up Philip, the results of a group attempt, apparently successful, to create and conjure up a ghost out of whole cloth. The title of their talk was \"The UFO Phenomenon and its Relationship to .Parapsychological Research.\" The Owenses said they first became seriously involved with the UFO phenomenon as a result of an Peter Mazzola, Director of Scientific Bureau of Invest- igation extensive questionnaire circulated in the pages of the National Enquirer newspaper, to which they received more than 20,000 replies. The first ten questions covered the normal spectrum of paranormal events such as poltergeist activity, apparitions, out-of- the body experiences, precognition, and so on. But the llth question was left open and simply asked if the respondent had had any other unusual events happen to them other than those mentioned above. To their surprise, the Owens team found that a significant percentage reported UFO experiences. The strongest correlation was with those who also reported poltergeist activity. Some of the UFO experiences, the Owenses said, could be hallucinations, in the same way that visions of deceased relatives or religious figures were frequently perceived by people under periods of great stress. This might be particularly true of humanoid figures, especially if the witness was predisposed to the idea of flying saucers and aliens from outer space. The Owenses also remarked on the curious parallel between UFOs and globes of light sometimes associated with poltergeist activity. \"In poltergeist cases, the ball of light is always reported indoors,\" said Iris Owen, \"but we have no reason to suppose it could not occur outdoors as well.\" Another interesting parallel between UFO and parapsychological phenomena could be seen in the area of \"thoughtography,\" the ability of some psychics like Ted Serios, to apparently affect photographic emulsion by the power of thought alone. The Owenses showed several interesting slides at this point and said that their own research with a Toronto psychic had convinced them that such a power was possible. \"We find it interesting to compare these examples with photographs of UFOs which were not seen by the witness at the time the picture was taken, but only appeared .after developing. Are they UFOs or thoughtographs made subconsciously by the photographer?\" But the main point they wanted to emphasize, the Owenses re-iterated, was not that they thought UFOs were only another parapsychological manifestation, but that their own methodology might prove effective in the investigation of UFO reports. And their own methodology, they said, was not to concentrate so much on the UFO itself, although they considered that important enough, but to delve into the overall picture, particularly the history and prior state of mind of the person making the report. Regardless of the origin of UFOs, said Dr. J. Allen Hynek of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), reports tend to be sporadic, or to come in waves over a short period of time. Such periods of concentrated UFO activity . are known as \"flaps,\" and if ufologists want to maximize their resources, they had better be prepared for the next one, whenever that might be. Hynek noted that during the last big flap in America, in 1973, local ufologists had a golden opportunity to bring the seriousness of the UFO phenomenon to the attention of policy-making bodies and the public at large. \"Instead,\" said Hynek, \"the supermarket, or tabloid, press took over and had their day, effectively closing the doors to serious attention, but opening them to renewed ridicule. The 1973 flap, so to speak, had the wrong sponsors! We must not let that happen again.\" Hynek called for the formation of a \"Flap Steering Committee\" which could begin to put a carefully prearranged plan into play the moment a flap appeared imminent or had just begun. We must \"make the media work for us and not against us,\" Hynek urged, and one way this might be possible would be (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FREDERICK VALENTICH ENCOUNTER: UPDATE By Paul Norman (© 1982, Paul Norman) One night in November 1953,1 was called outside my home to observe an unidentified flying object approach and hover over a power station in Tennessee. That same month, two military airmen were sent in pursuit of a mysterious flying object. They never returned. Little did I dream that nearly three decades later I would be involved, with colleagues, in the greatest mystery in Australian aviation history. During the evening of October 21, 1978, 20-year-old Australian - pilot Frederick Valentich disappeared over Bass Strait .while flying from Melbourne's Moorabbin Airport to King Island, off the coast of Victoria. His disappearance occurred at 1912:28 hrs., during the peak of the largest UFO flap in Australian history. Over 3 l / 2 years after that fatal Saturday evening, no trace has ever been found of either the pilot or his Cessna 182 aircraft. During my travels and correspondence, 1 have found many false stories circulating around the world regarding this most important case. I have found these inaccurate statements are coming from individuals at home and abroad, who live hundreds of miles from the scene where the action took place, newcomers to the field, newsmen who have tried to give the incident their own twist from their limited knowledge of the known details, and last but not least, from individuals of the scientific community who have concocted a preconceived theory and have tried to make their ideas fit around it. Those researchers who are familiar with the outstanding Larry Coyne case (Oct. 1973 UFO encounter over Ohio by Army Reserve helicopter crew) will recognize that the Frederick Valentich description follows generally the same pattern as that of Larry Coyne's helicopter crew. That startling encounter took place 5 years prior to the Valentich encounter over Bass Strait. The object in each case was described as cigar or long shape, displayed the same maneuverability, hovering characteristics, and the green light. Larry Coyne and his crew got back to tell their story—Frederick Valentich didn't. Frederick Valentich was not the only person who reported a strange object in the sky over Bass Strait that day and night. His ears were not the only ears that heard strange sounds that day and night. Researchers have found over 50 reported sightings of UFOs around Bass Strait which occurred before, during, and after the Valentich disappearance. Most of this information would never have been found but for the work of researchers from the Victorian Research Society (VUFORS) based at Moorabbin, the location from whence the mysterious flight started. This incident was at first treated as an ordinary lost aircraft case. However, the difficulty in keeping details of this disappearance hidden was because several other pilots flying at the same time were tuned to the same radio frequency. The world first learned that a UFO was involved when one of those pilots tipped-off the press. We first heard of the UFO involvement on the following day, October 22nd. I immediately phoned Judith Magee, who is President of the Victorian UFO Research Society in Victoria. We had been members of the Moorabbin Aero Club for several years. Judith is a former airline hostess with a wide acquaintance of pilots and familiar with the language in aviation circles. She was the logical person to go probing aviation personnel for information. We were the first members to arrive in the dining room and order our meals. When the waitress returned to the table, Judy asked, \"What is all this talk about a UFO/aircraft chase?\" The waitress replied, \"yes, they had a meeting with some of the pilots. They (continued on next page) Symposium, Continued for the Steering Committee to sponsor a professionally arranged press conference at a major U.S. city and make sure that it was picked up by the major wire services. The conference would have to be centered around a significant sighting, such as the Pascagoula, Mississippi, abduction of Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker during the height of the 1973 flap. In order to present a united front, representatives of the major UFO organizations would need to coordinate their activities and quickly and thoroughly investigate any major case. A \"situation report\" should then be given, the verified facts stated, and the particular report under discussion put in proper perspective to the entire UFO picture. \"The case should not be allowed to stand alone,\" Hynek argued, \"or the public be allowed to think that this was just some freak story from some probably freaked out individuals! \"The presentation should be dignified and carry a definite message that the UFO phenomenon is real, has been with us, all over the world, for sometime, and may very well have far- reaching consequences for all of us. \"And now,\" concluded Dr. Hynek, \"let us hope that the next flap does not occur before this Steering Committee has been formed and has been able to act. We don't want to miss another opportunity for advancement of the field because we are not ready.\"° 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Update, Continued ,,; were told not to divulge anything.\" We heard later that some of those pilots were flying at the time of the encounter. As the people began to gather, there were all sorts of rumors, stories, and speculation, such as hoax, suicide, secret military mission, stolen aircraft, the pilot had become disorientated, he had joined drug runners or had been murdered, etc. All these have been proven to be incorrect, unfounded, or beyond the scope of this young man. I waited for the appearance of two pilots with whom we had discussed the subject many times. They both had previous encounters and were interested in similiar cases. Finally, one of the pilots came in and took his seat at the bar. I walked up to him and before I opened my mouth he: waved his hand and said, \"I don't know a damned thing.\" He hasn't discussed UFOs with me since. The next morning (Monday) when newspapers came out all over Australia and the world, for that matter (although overseas headlines were not as pronounced), \"Box Car\" front-page headlines led the news of the day. About 9 a.m. I went over to Judy's home where the main VUFORS phone is located. She met me at the door with the remark, \"I'm glad you came, this phone has been ringing off the hook since six o'clock and I've got other work to do.\" VUFORS telephones kept ringing for three days, almost constantly. People were wanting to report sightings of 10, 15, and 20 years ago, but we were trying to keep the lines clear for current reports. Tp complicate matters, some members of the press were demanding all the answers before we had the opportunity to investigate. The Bass Strait flap had been building up for over 6 weeks prior to the Valentich disappearance. UFO activity reached a peak that very weekend of October 21, 1978. Frederick Valentich was not the only person who reported a UFO on that day. Hundreds of people reported dozens of UFOs that same day and night. More daytime sightings were reported that day than in any flap we have ever investigated. Many of these reports have been published in the VUFORS publication Australian UFO Bulletin, the MUFON UFO Paul Norman recounts pilot disappearance case Journal, The International UFO Reporter, the APRO Bulletin, and other UFO publications throughout the world. One of the first attempts to debunk the encounter came from an official spokesman. \"The pilot had been flying upside down and had seen his reflection in the water.\" This hastily presented \"explanation\" immediately backfired. The fuel tanks of a Cessna-182 are located in the wings and the gasoline flows to the engine by gravity. There is no fuel pump in this type of airplane. It will not fly upside down for more than 50 seconds. Speculation that the sound was of the aircraft crashing into the water is incorrect. Due to the curvature of the earth, the radio could not have been heard by Melbourne Flight Service controller, had the Cessna been at sea level. Neither would a crash last for 17 seconds, which was the duration of the strange noise. Attempts were made to manipulate public opinion that the pilot was not where he reported his position. Wrong again! Witnesses camped along the Packer River, 5 miles east of the Cape Otway lighthouse, observed his blue and white Cessna turn toward King Island at precisely the time he was due in that area. Perhaps the most unscrupulous and deceptive reporting of the entire event occurred when newsmen misrepresented and misquoted the statements made by the Bay Pines Motel manager, when Frederick's girl friend asked at the reception desk if there was a Valentich registered there. She was looking for the pilot's father, Guido Valentich. The press misquoted the facts and reported that she had asked for Frederick Valentich, the missing pilot. Consequently another twist appeared as a front page \"scoop:\" Ronda and friends were to have a rendezvous with the pilot. Some newsmen were busily engaged in trying to make the incident look like a hoax. The facts, are that the friends of Frederick Valentich, thinking a possibility existed that he might have turned back to Cape Otway, the nearest land to his last reported position, were there to search for him. The newspapers which published this false twist have editors who are of the Philip Klass, anti-UFO persuasion. They have never retracted this false report. Another false twist to this baffling mystery was alleged suicide. Rumors were being circulated that Frederick was in financial difficulty and friction existed in the family. The precise opposite is true. Frederick Valentich had a savings account of $2,500.00. Guido Valentich has experienced (conrinued on next page) 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"WHAT HAPPENED IN KLICKITAT COUNTY? By Greg Long (© 1982 by Greg Long) From 1972 to 1974, UFO activity on the Yakima Inidan Reservation in south-central Washington State was intense. 1 The level of UFO activity outside the Reservation was generally unknown. Data recently collected suggest, however, that UFO activity was equally intense during 1974 and 1975 south of the Reservation in Kltckitat County. Significantly, the southern end of the Yakima Indian Reservation juts into northern Klickitat County, a sparsely populated agricultural, ranching, and lumbering region (Figure 1). A visitor to Goldendale, the county seat (population 3,200), has an imposing view of the Simcoe Mountains to the north. Ten miles south lie the Columbia River and the Columbia Hills. In 1973 the Goldendale Observatory, which houses the nation's largest public telescope, was dedicated and opened. The observatory was a major research center for the 1979 eclipse. On the evening of July 31 and during the early morning hours of August 1,1974, something unusual was witnessed by people in Klickitat County. Their experiences were reported a week later in the Goldendale Sentinel. 2 Fig. 1.—Klickitat County Almost 8 years later, I interviewed several of the principal witnesses. Around 11:45 p.m., July 31, 1974, Mrs. Robert Basse, one of her daughters, and a foster daughter were sitting in the backyard of their home in Wishram Heights (See Figure 1). A \"star\" in the northeast sky caught their attention because of its unusually bright colors. Later, the three noticed a number of lights directly north of them which seemed to be alternately arranged in alphabet-letter-shaped patterns. Two pairs of binoculars were brought out. Through them, the witnesses observed six to eight objects arranged in the sky. During the 2 hours of observation, the soundless objects moved upward in stairstep fashion, (continued on next page) Update, Continued difficulty transferring his son's account to a term account which pays a higher interest rate. Guido Valentich still has hopes that his son will someday return. When Frederick commenced his flying lessons, his parents did not favor him becoming a pilot because of the dangers involved. Apart from this original objection and the normal scoldings that I or any other father gives his sons at that age, no problem existed. The family was very close knit. Suicide is ruled out because of outstanding reasons. Frederick was very fond of his girl-friend. He was keen to secure his commercial license. He had bought a new suit of clothes just prior to his disappearance. The same reasons apply to discount rumors that the aircraft had been stolen. If the pilot had stolen the plane for resale, he would have selected a more expensive one. Besides, he would have had to land the airplane after dark on a lighted runway. No official admission has ever been made that either the Cessna and/or the UFO were detected by radar. It is a documented fact that hundreds of people reported dozens of UFOs during the same day and night. These reports flooded the telephones of Radio and TV Stations, newspaper desks, and VUFORS telephones. Witnesses have been located who observed a blue and white Cessna which matched the pilot's flight plan. Frederick Valentich was not the only person who reported a green light at the position where he vanished. It is a known fact that officialdom insists there is no such thing as an unknown flying object. The Frederick Valentich case is still open. The last statement to come from official sources states: \"The conclusion will probably be a flying accident due to an unknown cause.\" (Based on Mr. Norman's talk at the 1982 MUFON UFO Symposium, July 2-4, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.) 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"County, Continued travelling from left to right in short, \"jerky\" motions. This activity was random and without sequence. The objects (half a thumbnail in size through binoculars) had two appearances during the event: either as \"Vanilla wafers\" with a \"hump\" on top, or as spinning \"discs\" (see Figure 2, from Mrs. Basse's original sketch). The \"wafers\" had red or blue lights, and periodically \"flipped\" over to reveal dark, round shapes with blue, yellow, green, and red lights on their circumferences. These lights blurred together as the discs spun, giving the appearance of a fireworks display. Curiously, the \"wafers\" seemed to \"rock\" gently while hovering (a classic UFO behavior). Mrs. Basse never saw the \"wafers\" \"flip\" over but surmises they did. While some of the objects spun, others retained \"side\" views. During the observation, the original \"star\" in the northeast either vanished or joined the other objects. At this point, a trained investigator would conclude that the Basses were understandably confused by scintillating bright stars enhanced through magnification. However, when the objects suddenly . aligned themselves together in a triangle formation (See Figure 2) made up of red and blue lights and began moving slowly northeast, concerned curiosity turned to fear, and Mrs. Basse and her daughters went inside and telephoned the Goldendale sheriff's office. The sheriffs office confirmed that other citizens had observed \"the lights\" (whether these lights or others is unclear). Mrs. Basse is certain that seven lights made up the triangle. The blue and red lights were in no particular sequence. The bottom light was closer to the observers than the others, and the three lights on the lefthand side were furthest away. If the triangular formation continued northerly, it would have passed near Goldendale and eventually over the Simcoe Mountains. According to the Goldendale Sentinel news reporter, two law enforcement officers saw \"them\"—and one saw them pass Goldendale and hover over the Simcoes. - Around midnight on July 31, a fire lookout on Grayback Mountain, who I have identified as Wendy Warren, then 20 (now a television reporter, KNDO- TV, Yakima, Washington) observed, along with a friend, the shortlived appearance of an unusual object. The bright, luminescent oval object behaved like a meteor and thus is discounted from serious consideration. However, a radio call that Warren received one evening during the summer of 1974 proved more interesting. A distresed female lookout at Dymond Gap was worried because of \"flashing red lights\" that were near her 102-foot-high observation tower. Warren, 15 miles northeast, saw the lights; a lookout at Nestor Peak explained away the lights as hovering or slow-traveling \"helicopters.\" The Dymond Gap lookout died in 1975, thwarting a solution to this mystery. (The Goldendale Sentinel story mistakenly identified Warren's July 31st sighting as of \"strange bright lights\"—in addition to counting an extra witness. Woe betide sloppy news reporters who \"investigate\" UFOs!) About August 9, 1974, Terry Stone, 19, a male fire lookout (and now • head of the Juvenile Department, Goldendale), was on duty at Lorena Butte Lookout (elevation 2,291 feet). Between 10:30 p.m. and midnight, during a very clear night, while reclining on his bunk, he saw a featureless, self- luminous, red-glowing cigar-shaped object traveling along the axis of its length from south to north, west of his position. With the naked eye, the object appeared the size of three or four stars in a horizontal line, through 7x50 binoculars the width of a thrumbnail at arm's length. The vertical azimuth of the object throughout its flight was approximately 60 degrees. At about 225 degrees horizontal azimuth from \"true north,\" a front portion of the object (perhaps one third of the total) detached and traveled 90 degrees to the line of flight, eventually reaching the zenith where it vanished from sight. The rest of the object, retaining its essential shape, continued north and disappeared over Indian Rock on the southern perimeter of the COLORS RAN TOGETHER FURTHES AWAY \"FLIPPED\" VIEW ~* CLOSEST TRIANGULAR FORMATION Fig. 2.-July 1974 UFOs Yakima Indian Reservation. During the entire flight, the object, which appeared to be at a great height, did not deviate from its course. The object left no trail and did not appear to be a meteor (duration of sighting was 15 minutes). Stone (who had 6 years experience as a lookout at Lorena Butte) told me that as a lookout he had seen missile launches at Vandenburg AFB, tumbling meteors, and weather balloons, and that this phenomenon was completely different than those objects. The NORAD Space Computation Center told me 3 that no manmade objects were predicted to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere over the Klickitat County area on or near August 9,1974. (On July 21, 1974, a fire lookout on Satus Peak in the Yakima Indian Reservation sighted to the west a light silver or grey cigar-shaped object traveling from south to north. She watched the object through binoculars as it vanished behind Deer Butte.)

The object \"was gone\" before he could point it out to his family, who were in the car with him. The exact date of this sighting is not given. More \"definitive\" confirmation that something unusual was taking place in Klickitat County during the summer of 1974 came from two teenage boys in Goldendale. At approximately 11:00 p.m., July 19,1974, the boys (they request anonymity) were outside on the lawn of the younger boy's house observing the stars through a telescope. Suddenly a pulsating, glowing- white light appeared to their left (the east) traveling at apparent house-top level from the northeast to the southwest. The younger boy (14) described the light as elliptical in shape with definite flattening at the top and bottom. Angular elevation: 20 to 30 degrees. Distance: approximately 1 mile. The younger boy ran into the house, grabbed his Square Shooter 2 Polaroid Land Camera containing Type. 88 Polaroid Colored Print Film (which was sitting on the couch), ran back outside, had time to set the focus on infinity, and photographed the object as it reappeared after passing behind trees that obstructed his view. The soundless object continued southwest and was lost sight of behind trees. The original photograph shows a clear, discernible, slightly oval white object with the suggestion of a thin \"dome\" on top. Stars are sharp and of high contrast. The photograph, which the photographer (now 22 years old) retains in his possession, is of excellent quality. A blow-up portion of the photograph is presented here (Figure 3). Unfortunately, the reproduction is fourth generation—a print made from a slide of a print of the original. However, the photograph clearly shows an elliptical object and the appearance of a roundish \"protrusion\" on top. A print of the photograph was evaluated by CUFOS, who concluded that the object was unexplainable. 12 Fig. 3.—July 1974 photograph The size of the object remained constant during the sighting. Neither witness believes the object was an aircraft. The boys had observed the sky for several nights before the sightings and were familiar with the behavior of aircraft running lights. Neither witness sought publicity and avoids publicity even today 8 years after the event. The case came to light only by happenstance—through correspond- ence between a neighbor of the photographer and a CUFOS investigator, who mentioned the photographic case to me. I searched the Goldendale Sentinel files in hopes of turning up more references to UFO activity in the county but found none. Then, by accident, I spoke with a Klickitat County law enforcement officer who related to me a personal experience that I have no reason to doubt— especially since I had never met the officer before. At about 10:00 p.m. on a late fall or early winter evening in 1974, the officer was driving back on Highway 141 to his farm 4% miles north of White Salmon. Suddenly an airborne object appeared from the east, flying over a hill on the right side of the highway. The object traveled west over the highway and stopped and hovered over the Curly Jones Orchards, located near Echo Glen where Highway 141 turns sharply to the right (see Figure 1). At first the officer thought the object was a helicopter, except that this \"craft\" appeared to be in distress—it was wobbling erratically like a top .out of control. The officer pulled over and stopped. Soon the object moved toward him, south along a 500-foot-high ridge, but remained west of the highway about y<i mile away. Dipping down in front of the ridge, the object continued to wobble and bob 30 to 40 feet above the ground. The officer described the object as \"two large cereal bowls put one on top of the other,\" or as a \"fat hockey puck.\" The length of the object was about 40 feet, the width 10 feet, and the UFO glowed fluorescent white. The object seemed to emit light from the inside, although the officer could determine no power source. By this time, the officer had flagged down a young man as a witness, who soon left the scene in terror, and a car with several passengers pulled over. During the observation, the officer tried to relate the object to something he could understand. Gradually the realization came over him that he was watching something totally unknown, a fear ran through him. He reported the (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"County, Continued UFO to the Klickitat County sheriff's office. After 15 minutes of weaving and wobbling in one position, the UFO returned north to the orchards, where it remained above the trees for another 15 minutes. From a safe distance near the orchard, the officer continued to watch the object until it suddenly streaked upward into the north and vanished \"like a meteor\" through 5,000- foot-level clouds. Upon returning home, the officer discovered that a White Salmon family had telephoned his wife and reported that a large \"light\" had appeared near the .family's house, and that someone had tried to open the back door. At the scene, the officer found no signs of trespassing or forced entry. Since the light had appeared near the time of his sighting, he conjectured that the two lights were one and the same. However, we'll never know; the family (now living in another community) did not respond to my letter of inquiry. The officer was later severely reprimanded by his supervisors for relating his experiences in a public way. In addition, he was told by his superiors that he had never seen anything. According to the officer, UFO sightings were so prevalent in Klickitat County during 1974 and 1975 that county law enforcement officers were responding to \"saucer\" calls at least once a week. Because of the intensity, officers were directed to refer to a UFO sighting as a \"plane in distress,\" thereby disguising their responses to UFO sighting calls, which was monitorable over citizen-band radios. \"If you saw one (a UFO),\" the officer said, \"you turned your head.\" According to the officer, UFO activity was so intense that citizens reported almost anything that \"twitched.\" Then, abruptly, UFO activity suddenly ceased at the end of 1975. During the high-activity period, the officer was called to ranches where he witnessed the remains of mutilated cows, which bore the \"classic\" signs of ritual killing—carcasses lying on their right sides, tongues removed, anuses cored out. During this period, two cattle mutilations occurred near White Salmon, one near Centerville. No tracks surrounded the dead animals, and the carcasses were not disturbed by predators. In another case, an officer responding to a UFO call one evening along the Boundary Road on the southern edge of the Yakima Indian Reservation, came face to face with three human-like \"things\" covered with hair from head to foot. He panicked and left the scene in terror. Finally, the officer who related these tales to me referred, without prompting and without knowledge of my interest in the Basse case, to a sighting a fellow officer made of a \"triangle-shaped object\" with \"rotating lights\" that appeared over Wishram Heights and Centerville in the summer of 1974. The fellow officer drove in a truck toward the objects and shone his flashlight at them. The objects responded. Conclusion What really happened in Klickitat County in the summer of 1974? And during the rest of that year and 1975? A key lies with county law enforcement officials. Yet none of the officers to whom I sent letters of inquiry, including the sheriff, responded to my requests for further information. However, it seems highly likely that the same nocturnal lights that the Basses witnessed were observed by two officers—one who was dispatched to the Goldendale airport at 2:00 a.m. (which would have been the exact time that the lights moved north from Wishram Heights after a two-hour display beginning at 11:00 p.m.); and one who witnessed them near Wishram Heights and Centerville, and approaching them, shone a flashlight at them. The officer who confided the latter information to me is reluctant to speak further regarding details of this event, and thus this tantalizing multiple- witness case remains frustrated and unsolved. And all over odd-looking lights (I repeat lights) in the sky! The proximity of the Yakima Indian Reservation to Klickitat County is important. Is it conceivable that UFOs \"spill out\" of the Reservation during flap periods? During my investigations, I learned of a case in which an object passed over the Simcoe Mountains and apparently \"entered\" the Reservation. At about 8:30 a.m. on a clear, sunny day, either before or after the UFO \"scare\" of June 24,1947, Fred and Miles Stone, two brothers now in their 70's—Fred is the grandfather of Terry Stone (see sighting described ealier)— were driving west of Goldendale on Highway 142 to install plumbing at a job site. About 300 yards outside the city limits, they sighted a large, silver- colored, cirgar-shaped or oblong dirigible-like object moving northeasterly toward the Simcoes at a distance of 12 to 15 miles. The object had no visible attachments or markings. After observing the object for about 30 seconds, the men pulled over and watched the object outside their truck for about 2 minutes as it moved steadily toward the Simcoes. The object finally went behind the range and was lost from sight. No dirigibles were evident in this part of the country at the time, nor was air traffic notable in 1947. Witnesses who reported their experiences in the study presented here were serious and objective about what they saw. None revealed emotional preoccupation or a pet \"theory\" about UFOs. I have no reason to doubt their testimony or sincerity. Exactly what happened in Klickitat County in 1974 and 1975 will most likely never be known; yet if the officer who confided in me is correct (and I believe he is), something occurred in Klickitat County of major proportions— something highly unusual which calls for an explanation. Postscript Some new information has come to light regarding the sighting of a dirigible-or cigar-like object in 1947 over the Simcoe Mountains in northern Klickitat County. According to Dr. A.D. Topping, editor of Buoy ant Flight, the newsletter of the Lighter-Than-Air Society: ....There were \"dirigible-like lighter-than-air craft\" in the U.S. in the summer of 1947. Many of the Navy's WW II airship fleet had been sold as surplus. Some were bought by Goodyear, but (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"POSSIBLE REPTILIAN ORIGINS OF CERTAIN UFO OCCUPANTS Erich A. Aggen, Jr. (MUFON Field Investigator) In the January 1982 issue of Flying Saucer Review, Dr. Bernard E. Finch in an article entitled \"Dinosaurs...Not Humanoids?\" makes the interesting observation that an intelligent species having evolved from reptilian forebears would bear \"remarkable similarities to descriptions of (UFO) aliens which are received from many sources.\" Adrian J. Desmond states in his book The Hot-Blooded Dinosaurs that, \"The most intriguing Late Cretaceous inhabitants were the intelligent 'mimics' unearthed in recent years, wide-eyed ostrich dinosaurs, and dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Saurornithoides, with stereo-vision functionally mated to opposable thumbs. These dinosaurs, capable of more skillful behavioral feats than any land animal hitherto, were seperated from other dinosaurs by a gulf comparable to that dividing men from cows: the disparity in brain size is staggering—who knows what new peaks the sophisticated 'bird-mimics' would have attained had they survived into the 'Age of Mammals'.\" Had the dinosaurs not died out, they quite likely could have become the dominant form of life on Earth. Mammalian life succeeded only because the more aggressive and predatory dinosaurs were removed from the scene. On many other planets with more favorable conditions, reptilian life could have survived and attained its full potential. An intelligent species evolved from reptiles would certainly possess many of the physiological characteristics we have come to identify in certain groups of UFO occupants. Leonard Stringfield in \"A Study of Humanoids and the Anonymous Human Factor\" has identified some of the more important characteristics: (1) Two round eyes without pupils— elongated, sunken or deep set, far apart, slightly slanted. (2) A large head compared to the size of the torso and limbs. (3) No ear lobes or protrusive flesh extending beyond apertures on each side of the head. (4) The nose is vague.

They were used mostly for advertising, and barnstormed over much of the country. I am not able to say whether any of them was in the vicinity of Goldendale, Washington, that summer, however. If used for advertising, I'd think it would have been noticeably marked, but perhaps at 4,000 feet elevation some markings that might have been used would not have been noticeable. All these airships would have had tail surfaces and a car, but perhaps from some angles they would not have been obvious. Incidentally, barrage balloons were used in the Seattle area at least early in the war. I don't know what happened to them after the war, but they may well have also been sold as surplus, possibly bought and inflated by someone. (Personal letter) To determine if surplus airships were near Goldendale or Yakima, Washington (Yakima would have been its most obvious destination), a search of newspapers of the time will be required.

It is full of flaws, yet brilliantly dramatized. It is a paradox; but so is the entire UFO phenomenon a paradox. As an explanation of the statement that the picture is full of flaws, note the following points: An occupant from an extra- terrestrial ship is separated from its fellows; the ship takes off without him, leaving the little fellow desolate and stranded on earth. There are no precedents, no cases, reported to date which contain any hint that UFO occupants could be caught in such a situation. All good documented cases suggest that these intelligences can handle any situation which confronts them, as far as interaction with human beings is concerned. Witnesses who try to approach landed UFOs with occupants are often paralyzed or held back as by invisible walls. Even lone occupants seem to have the ability to paralyze curious humans, to speed away in abnormal fashion, or to dematerialize. This art of dematerialization, common to occupants and their craft, can be regarded either as a means of escape or of preventing possible harm to witnesses. The phenomenon,, in general, seems capable of handling anything which may occur. The sole exceptions to this are the occasional crashes which we suspect, with good reason, might have occurred and been cleaned up secretly by the government. Yet even in these crashes, from what we know to date, all the occupants \"go down with the ship\" and are dead when found. There is one undocumented case of a crashed alien who lived for some little time but could not survive even the best efforts of the government to keep him alive. Another rumored case mentioned by Leonard Stringfield mentions a UFO occupant which was kept alive a considerable time. It is possible that \"E.T.\" was partially based on this unsubstantiated case. Another flaw in Spielberg's film is that the alien is terrified by its human pursuers. It runs from them on its impossibly squat legs. It apparently has no weapons of defense and no means of escape. Yet later on in the film when the alien is pursued by other humans while (continued on next page) Reptilian, Continued eyelids and a third membrane which can be drawn over the front of the cornea.

We can extrapolate that if certain UFO occupants are indeed the product of reptilian evolution that some of the aforementioned physical traits must apply to them, albeit in a more advanced form. * , The anomalous physical peculiarities as pointed out by Leonard Stringfield, i.e., no apparent reproductive organs; a colorless liquid present instead of blood; and no digestive system, GI tract, or rectal area; can perhaps be explained by a lack of truly definitive data. The absence of reproductive organs, for example, can be explained by the fact that reptilian life forms carry these organs internally concealed generally by an almost invisible longitudinal slit. The \"reptilian hypothesis,\" of course, can only be selectively applied to a certain well-defined group of UFO occupants. UFO occupants in general are widely diverse in nature. Various hypotheses of origin must be considered. The reptilian theory is a tentative experimental starting point. REFERENCES Desmond, Adrian J. The Hot-Blooded Dinosaurs. (New York: Warner, 1977.)

Rutledge Prentice Hall 1981, 265 pages. A review of Dr. Rutledge's book was an item on my calendar until I read the book review by Mr. Rodeghier in the captioned CUFOS publication. As a poet is granted poetic license, one who writes book reviews must be given some latitude in his criticism. Such concession, however, does not abandon reasonableness and fairness, and upon observing such breaches throughout Mr. Rodeghier's piece my intention to write a review was overridden by the responsibility to negate any harm he may have wreaked upon Dr. Rutledge and his remarkable contributions to ufology. Harley D. Rutledge, Ph.D, Chairman of the Physics Department, Southeast Missouri State University, conceived, founded and provided the leadership for Project Identification, a 7-year, truly scientific, investigation and study of UFO phenomena. The book is Dr. Rutledge's scholarly, meticulous, and professional record of the extended and productive endeavor. It certainly is no big deal to attack a book by jumping on its title, but Mr. Rodeghier does that very thing. He gripes because the subtitle claims the book is the \"First\" scientific field study of UFOs. A query of Dr. Rutledge would have disclosed that the title was not of the author's selection, which is nearly always the case. Having set the stage for nitpicking, the said revitwer nitpicks his picayunish way along, even complaining that Dr. Rutledge's writing \"style\"—by including bits of human interest—is nothing more than \"padding\" of his book. At this point in Mr. Rodeghier's review there is a droll interjection as follows: \"(Ed. Note: When I read the book I used the marginal notation 'w.c.' for such irrelevancies. It stands for'who cares?'; the margins were richly annotated throughout with w.c.s.).\" Wonder who that comic editor is who so cleverly padded the review with the sidelight on his amusing use of \"w.c.\"— could it be W.C. Fields sending a gag in code from the Great Beyond? Oh, well, at present we have more pressing issues to deal with, so—who cares? The author's Project Identification comprised a company of 40 people— faculty members and students, and other professional and lay members from Cape Girardeau and vicinity—and some perception of the personalities and characters participating in the concerted endeavor doesn't detract from the play-by-play but enhances it. It is good also to read how the intense (continued on next page) California Report, Continued in the care of its young human friends, it has the ability to levitate both itself and its human companions to avoid capture. The fact it did not use this talent to escape in the first part of the film remains unexplained. It is a major flaw and bothers logical viewers. We must not regard \"E.T.\" as a logical film. It is essentially an attempt to teach an important point to mankind— and that lesson seems to be that other so-called \"alien\" intelligences could come in various shapes and sizes and be of such foreign appearance that they would terrify unprepared witnesses. It is an attempt—and a highly successful one—to teach us that the more pliable and open-minded humankind can be, the easier it would be to accept the fact of other types of life other than those on earth: This pliability and openminded- ness in the film is represented almost wholly by children, but there is one adult, appearing toward the end of the film, who is as accepting as the children, yet he states his acceptance began while he was still a child. \"E.T.\" is lopsided. It represents only one possibility. It deals with a thoroughly physical UFO, a thoroughly physical lost alien. All contact between the human children and ET are without harm to each other. There is no problem with alien bacteria, no threat from radiation damage, etc. Yet we know that in many reports, witnesses are physically damaged, displaying symptoms ranging from mild conjuctivitis to severe radiation poisoning. No mention is made, also, of the psychological and physiological damage to witnesses' psyches, caused possibly by blood chemistry changes from contact with unknown types of electromagnetic fields. But the field of UFO research is so complicated that we must congratulate Spielberg for giving us a glimpse into what might be some day. The film is a preparation for the right way to receive one type of visiting, friendly ET visitors. It is a clear lesson to government about the wrong way to approach the question of UFO visitation. The only thing thoroughly realistic about the movie is the way government agents act—furtively, bullishly, inhumanely. It depicts all the negative factors government has used during the past 35 years, even to the zippered plastic baggie in a cryogenic tank! This film cries out for a change in government attitude. It intimates that UFOs are a human problem. The UFO phenomenon has clearly demonstrated that other types of intelligences are interacting with humans (not governments). Let them interact without restrictions. Let witnesses feel free to report contacts without fear of ridicule. Let researchers have a chance to hear immediately and first-hand from witnesses about their experiences. And let either government or private funding pay the costs of thorough investigation, done aboveboard, publicly, and objectively by the best scientific talent available. \"Scientific\" as used, here does not mean merely physical scientists. It includes social scientists and all talented persons who have spent years (continued on next page) 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Review, Continued UFO flap in Southeast Missouri brings Scientist Rutledge down from his Ph.D. tower, shows him face the hard UFO reality, and sees him grab the flying saucers by the horns.

From the foregoing nitpicking of real or furnished nits, the review lapses into sophistry's last resort: argumentum ad hominem —if no valid attack can be made on what the man has done, attack the man! Mr. Rodeghier doesn't believe Dr. Rutledge when he says he saw 37 UFOs from his own yard, that Project Identification made a total of 157 sightings, and that UFOs are under intelligent control. The reviewer wants to relegate most of the 157 UFOs to stars, hoaxes, and the effects of tectonic stresses, but also declares: \"From the context of the writing, it is clear that the possibility • that the 'obvious intelligence' might be human pilots was not entertained.\" From the context of the reviewer's writing, however, it is not clear whether the human pilots fly the stars, the hoaxes, or the tectonics. All of 'em, maybe? Some hot pilots! This review of a review for the most part has been criticising criticism, unjustified as said criticism is, but it is time to move over to the positive side. It is manifest that a fair, reasonable review of Dr. Rutledge's book should contain the observations and comments hereinafter outlined. 1. It is the first thorough account of the first extensive scientific investigation of UFOs— and while they were visible. 2. The book is professionally written and is well-edited and well- proofread (only one typographical error was found). 3. The author's application of his knowledge of physics, astronomy, and photography makes possible his splendid report of the technical and scientific achievements he fathered; he presents it in plain English but is technical when necessary, with enough human interest to hold the general reader as well as the veteran UFOIogist. 4. Photographs, tables, equations, maps and other illustrations are excellent. 5. Chapter 19 contains an innovative study of observer-UFO interaction, some UFOs indicating an awareness of the observers and reacting to their movements and activities. This review-reviewer noticed three or four nits in the book that he could nitpick on, but they were extirpated from conscious memory by the majesty of Project Identification's creative contributions to UFOlogy, and its record so splendidly chronicled by Harley D. Rutledge, Ph.D. If you haven't read Project Identification: The First Scientific Field Study of UFO Phenomena, do it now, and when you have read it you will give the book a place of prominence in your UFO library. Mr. Rodeghier must have received a message from the Great Beyond or somewhere about this review of his review, for you can hear him hammering out a rejoinder so furiously on his typewriter that his editor is standing by with the fire extinguisher. Oh, well, as the Phantom Editor would say, \"w.c.\" Who cares?-William D. Leet California Report, Continued studying the phenomenon objectively and without preconceptions. Let all facets of human knowledge be given equal freedom, and funds, to study the reports—parapsychologists, philoso- phers, and theologians alike with physical and social scientists. The UPO phenomenon is an all encompassing fact. It touches all facets of human knowledge. It suggests that many UFO reports are generated as a result of interdimensional visitors interacting with humankind. These apparently have the ability to manifest temporarily in a physical form in our atmosphere. These are every bit as important as the reports which suggests thoroughly physical craft and occupants from far away places in our own space-time (the type of alien involved in the film). Other films will have, to be made about those types of UFOs which are apparently inimical to human life— either outwardly hostile or, because of their nature, unable to interact without damaging witnesses physically and emotionally. The UFO phenomenon is multisource; most of us agree on that. And there seem to be good and bed aspects to be dealt with. We are not even sure whether all UFO phenomena are agreeable among themselves! There is a possibility that benevolent entities and malevolent entities, warring with each other perhaps, are both attempting to contact the human race. For what it is, \"ET—the Extraterrestrial\" is a start in the right direction, one small step, just as \"Close Encounters\" was a step toward public understanding of UFOs. It touches a bit of the phenomenon, teaches one necessary lesson, will likely raise the human consciousness toward one possible form of non-human life. But so much remains to be done. How long will it take before the human race fully accepts the fact that it is only one form of intelligence (and a comparatively lowly-evolved form at that). It has taken about 35 years between the scary \"alien\" pictures of the late forties and fifties and this uplifting film depicting proper human- alien interaction. Will we run out of time before the whole of the phenomenon is thoroughly explored and accepted? 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"CRITIC'S CORNER By Robert Wanderer Whenever I meet a hypnotist who \"regresses\" subjects into the past, I ask: How do you know that the story you get is \"true\" and not a creation of the subject's subconscious mind, similar to the dreams we all create every night? Some hypnotists seem to find this a strange question that had never occurred to them before. More often, the hypnotist will talk about conducting a few preliminary sessions before the \"regression,\" to become convinced that the subject is reasonable and telling the truth. But even this answer does not quite get to the heart of the matter: A hypnotized subject can be well- meaning and \"sensible-sounding\" and yet be unaware that the story being related is a product of the subconscious. One hypnotist I talked with put the matter in these terms: She had regressed people to find lost objects, and they had remembered under hypnosis where they had lost the object. She had regressed people in therapy to get through to some traumatic event that had happened in early childhood, and they had remembered it under hypnosis and thus overcame what was blocking their progess in therapy. So when she regressed people who had been shocked with some sort of UFO experience, and they came up with a story of being \"abducted\" onto a spaceship and having the typical adventures .that \"abductees\" usually report, she was sure that their stories were true. Regressive hypnosis works, she felt; it worked for lost objects and therapy blocks, so surely it works for UFO \"abductions\" too. But there is a key difference. In the lost object problem, hypnotism relaxed the subject and made it possible to remember where it was lost; the fact that the object was recovered is proof of the technique. A classic case was in the bizarre kidnapping of a busload of schoolchildren in California a few years ago; under hypnosis, a witness remembered a license number, and the case was solved. In the case of the person whose therapy was at a dead end because of a repressed traumatic event that had happened at the age of perhaps 4, the \"block\" was resolved and the therapy could proceed. To be sure, we don't know whether the story of the trauma developed under hypnosis was literally and objectively true, but at least it. represented how the person felt about the problem, and brought it out for a satisfactory resolution in therapy. In the case of the UFO \"abduction,\" however, there is no recovered object and there is no demonstration of improvement in therapy; there is nothing but an exotic, extremely unlikely story which the subject, in the intensity of the hypnotic experience, believes to be \"really true.\" The general problems here, as I see it, is that we tend to oversimplify our perception of the world around us; we like to classify an issue, such as hypnotism, as being either \"good\" or \"bad\", as \"right\" or \"wrong.\" But hypnotism offers both advantages and disadvantages. It's useful for relaxation, for helping people to reconsider and solve personal problems, for helping people to recall earlier experiences. It's on this matter of recalling the past that the advantages of hypnotism begin to dissolve into disadvantages, with the picture distorted by what we would like to believe. • People commonly view memory as a kind of storehouse from which material from years back can be recovered exactly as it happened. But psychology professor Elizabeth Loftus, who has conducted extensive research and written the excellent book Memory, finds that our memory consists of fragments that are constantly \"being altered, transformed, and distorted,\" and that-hypnosis tends to complicate the matter further by giving people a false confidence that the materials they are developing are accurate. 1 Distortion of memory through hypnosis has become recognized as sufficiently questionable in criminal cases as to constitute a breach of law; one major authority considers use of hypnosis by police on a potential witness to be \"tantamount to the destruction or fabrication of evidence.'\" 2 Hypnosis seems to be useful in bringing out material from the subconscious, particularly in helping people to get a clearer idea of how they interpret a situation. But as a sure method to find \"objective reality,\" hypnosis is so flawed as to be not merely useless but positively dangerous. REFERENCES 1.

Oberg attributes the observation to secret Soviet satellite launches. I rarely mention book reviews appearing in other publications, as I consider them to be a bit out of place in this column. However, I am only too willing to make an exception when it comes to Allan Hendry's review of Dr. Harley Rutledge's PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, which appears in the September issue of FATE. This is merely the latest attempt by CUFOS personnel to denigrate the work done, by Dr. Rutledge over an 8-year period in southeastern Missouri. A review by Mark Rodeghier in INTERNATIONAL UFO REPORTER (\"annotated\" by the great JAH himself) made many of the same objections and drew many of the same erroneous conclusions. If Hendry, Rodeghier, Hynek or any of the other CUFOS members had carried out similar field studies and had arrived at conclusions which were contrary to Rutledge's, then (and only then) it might be useful to consider their points of view. It goes without saying that they have not performed such research and are not likely to do so. Therfore, to me, this entire business has the distinct aroma of sour grapes. As Dr. Rutledge has said, his data and conclusions are in PROJECT IDENTIFICATION; read the book and decide for yourself if his study was \"scientific\" in nature. My view is that work such as that done by Rutledge is far more likely to benefit UFO research than are the nit-picking protestations of those who consider themselves \"UFO authorities,\" yet contribute little of value to the subject. Robert Girard of Arcturus Book Service (263 North Ballston Avenue, Scotia, NY 12302) is now publishing UFO books, as well as selling them. His first hardcover effort is Herbert J. Strentz's doctoral dissertation, A SURVEY OF PRESS COVERAGE OF UNIDENTIFED FLYING OBJECTS, 1947-1966. Strentz's work, while providing some interesting material on the attitudes of newsmen toward UFO reports, is somewhat dated. There are more than 40 tables of various statistics relating to the author's research, as well as an appendix and bibliography, for a total of 341 pages (8y 2 \" x 11\"). My major criticisms are threefold: (1) The book could have been produced in a quality softcover edition (a la THE UFO EVIDENCE or the annual MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS) which would have served the purpose just as well and which would have carried a lower pricetag; (2) If a typewriter edition was considered necessary, the manuscript should have been typeset; (3) More proof-reading of the manuscript would have eliminated numerous typographical errors. These criticisms are meant in a constructive sense, as I fully support Girard's publishing efforts and hope he will be able to provide us with UFO books which are available from no other sources. A responsible publisher specializing in such material is badly needed. The Strentz book is available for $24.50, plus 85<F postage.
