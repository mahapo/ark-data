The Lebanon City Police Department was advised of a UFO seen near the 4600 Block of Wilkerson Road. The mysterious object was said to be encased within a structure that resembled gridwork or cabling.      . The Warren County Communications Center dis- patched a Waynesville police officer to the location, and upon arrival at the scene he confirmed the unidentifiable nature of the object. As other officers verified the oddity and also sighted two other strange objects in the area, the Warren County Communications Center placed a telephone call to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, only to hear the tower operator disclaim any knowledge of or responsibility for air traffic or maneu- vers in the Waynesville vicinity during the incident. While the Waynesville police officers watched the ob- ject from Wilkerson Road looking south, a police dis- patcher also observed the same object from her position at the Warren County Communications Center in Leba- non, Ohio, looking north toward Waynesville. From re- view of the police tapes, it can be estimated that the primary object may have held a temporary position at a general location in the sky between Waynesville and Lebanon near the intersections of Pekin Road and Route 42. While an officer with the Caesar's Creek State Po- lice also noted the UFO from his location to the east of Waynesville, a third UFO was sighted in the area during the event, and the police witnesses repeatedly affirm a cogent distinction between the suspected UFOs and rou- tine stars and airplanes. The objects moved off by re- ceding further into the distance as other officers from the Ohio State Patrol arrived on the scene. On the police tapes acquired just weeks after the in- cident, dispatchers at the Ohio State Patrol and the War- ren County Communications Center are heard express- ing frustration at having to handle this situation and their inability to address the reports and eyewitness confir- mation from their officers. On the next evening, Wednesday, April 25, UFOs are again reported in the same area at 9:48 p.m., viewed from Wilkerson Road and also by officers observing from a location near the Waynesville Airport. Disturbingly, another unusual object is seen in the area seven hours later and reportedly pursues a motorist near Genntown, Location of Waynesville officer on Wltkerson Rd looking at U.FO. to the south/southwest of his location W,G.C.C. In Lebanon, where dispatcher observes U.F.Q.to the north, looking toward Wavnesvlfle OH (about 5-miles from Waynesville). A female complain- ant advises the Ohio State Patrol of her \"extreme con- cern\" regarding a triangular object with \"super bright lights\" that pursued her automobile while traveling on Route 122 at 5 a.m., April 26. These and other details were acquired from eyewit- ness interviews, analysis of various police reports, and evaluation of police tapes acquired through the Warren County Director of Emergency Services. Additional data was gathered through field investigation conducted on April 27 and April 28. Interview with primary witness After analysis of a CFS Record #01040891 from the Warren County Dept. of Emergency Services, a name of a witness to the April 24 UFO sighting in Waynesville was listed. That person, whose name will not be issued in this report for privacy purposes, was contacted on Monday, May 14,2001. Mrs. xxx said that they had no pictures or videotape of the object. When asked if she knew whether or not any of the police officers acquired videotape, she said: \"No, they did not get any videotapes either. Whether it was a UFO or not I don't know, but it was sure strange,\" she said. Mrs. xxx said that the object was seen several nights in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 July 2001 MUFON UFO Journal a row. On the first evening, April 24th, one bright light out her window caught her attention around 10:00 p.m. \"It caught my eye because I had never seen a star in that position before, and the longer I looked at it I saw the flashing and realized this wasn' t a star. \"I became concerned when it looked like an airplane coming right at me,\" she said, \"so I called the Lebanon Police Department. Mrs. xxx noted that after the police officers arrived and also saw the object, two other sus- pected UFOs were then observed. \"There were two other objects more to the east, the primary object more to the west,\" she explained. \"There were two objects that looked like an airplane light coming straight toward you, but it wasn't an airplane light. They turned to the southeast. The objects were farther away after the^police arrived.\" She said the objects were still visible enough, however, for the officers to confirm for her that they were not stars. Describing these objects as \"round\" in shape, Mrs. xxx said that the primary object to the west was the most easily visible. When pressed for a more exacting descrip- tion of the primary object seen at its closest vantage point, Mrs. xxx said that it was similar to a translucent ball with a large throbbing or pulsating light in the center of it. Al- though no outer shape or surface of the actual object could be discerned in darkness, certain structural detail was re- portedly observed. \"In front of this light were dark lines across it, like somebody took electric cable and criss-crossed the wire around it,\" she said. Mrs. xxx described the cabling as dark in color, silhouetted by the internal light source. There was no lighting on or around the cabling. When pressed again for continued detail on this \"cabling\" characteristic, she said that she would liken the object to a round globe or map of the world with \"lines running across the outside of the globe\" and \"streets running across the map. You could see a dark outline of criss-crossing lines in the fore- ground with the big throbbing light behind it.\" Pressed continuously on this detail, she acknowledged that it would be difficult to envision. She also described the object as having a \"black string\" wrapped sloppily around the bulbous globe of light. The light was throbbing or pulsating, \"beautiful and gorgeous with all different kind of colors,\" she said. Mrs. xxx also characterized the light source as flashing, like \"lightning\" going off, but without any streaks or rods of light being seen. She said that as the object moved further off, it resembled Christmas tree bulbs with many vivid colors. When asked if it was in the same part of the sky where stars were, she responded, \"No, there's absolutely no doubt about it. It was not a star. It was not the same color as a star, which is blue/white. This object was like light- ning going off in the inside of the ball, and you could dis- cern a perfectly round circumference of the ball with dark- ened lines or cables wrapped around it. There's simply doubt about it,\" she again assured me, \"this was not a star. You can get confirmation on this from the police who saw it also.\" Mrs. xxx said that the two less discernible objects to the east moved very rapidly while the primary object to the west largely held stationary. This movement, likened as similar to military jets, was in the direction to the south. Mrs. xxx and her husband said that they have never seen a UFO before this event. Chief Carter from the Waynesville police department (513-897-8020) was contacted on April 30 and May 1. He said that the situation was first reported by citizen advisement to the Warren County Sheriff's Department. \"Someone at home sitting near a window looked outside and spotted this thing,\" he said, \"they notified the Warren County Communications Center. Waynesville officers re- sponded and also saw it. The object sighted by two Waynesville officers was oval-shaped with blue and red lights circling it.\" Carter reported that a total of three objects appeared over the Girl Scout Camp in the vicinity of the Stoneybrook Nature Reserve and Township Line Road. From their van- tage point at the entrance to the Stoneybrook Nature Reserve, the UFO was seen at a distance toward the south-southwest. \"Ohio State Patrol, Caesars Creek State Park police and Warren County were also there,\" he said. When asked if the Waynesville officers had consid- ered the suspected UFOs could be misidentiiled stars or planets, Chief Carter said the notion was dealt with and discounted. \"These things held stationary for about an hour before they started moving,\" he said in response to the question. \"We're not experts in such matters, but they discount the possibility that these things were stars.\" Chief"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 2001 Page 5 Carter said the oval-shaped objects circled by blue and red lights appeared at a distance and were observed by the Waynesville police officers through binoculars. When asked if he reviewed the \"In-Car Video\" foot- age from the nights of April 24 and April 25, Chief Carter said the objects were \"too far away\" for the depart- ment to acquire good video footage. Chief Carter was not familiar with a report from a resident near Mason, OH, who reported hearing police radio traffic on a scan- ner where it was said the objects accelerated upward at high velocity. .   , Field investigation Arrangements were made for a survey of the night sky in Waynesville on Saturday evening, April 28,2001. The sky was very clear and the temperature was in the low 50s. An all-night stake-out of the area was made with headquarters set up in an open field at a campsite on Miller's Camp Ground located on Township Line Road, 2.5-miles from the sighting location. Shortly after dark, around 9 p.m., a momentary odd- ity became visibly apparent in the south-southwestern skies. Chris Mork and I noted a reddish-colored ball of light with soft, diffused edges briefly appear some dis- tance away, seen in the sky above treetop level. This aberration seemed to hold stationary and was only vis- ible for 1 to 2 seconds. I first noticed the abnormality, thinking it to be a light on top of a cell-phone tower. Mork caught the oddity from the corner of his eye. There was absolutely no sound, and the light source simply vanished as if a lightbulb switched off. It is unlikely that this unusual light source would be fireworks, since none were seen or heard at all the whole evening. At first it seemed un- likely this would have been attributed to a meteor due to its unusual appearance and seemingly stationary posi- tion in the sky. Despite this initial suspicion, the object was, in all probability, a meteor. Due to its brief appear- ance and our inability to accurately chart and document something seen so fleetingly, we conclude this suspected oddity to be an anecdotal and insignificant event. Looking to the south-southwest around 11 p.m., stars were visible along with a slight moon. The brightness of the stars were of no exceptional nature to justify a sus- picion of UFO misidentification by law enforcement of- ficers just days earlier on Wednesday, April 25 and Tues- day, April 24. Nothing else was seen for the duration of the evening. The following morning, a trip to the 4600 Block of Wilkerson Road was made to survey the area. The ad- dress listed as the location of the police sighting on Tues- day, April 24, was at the front gate of the Stonybrook Wildlife Refuge. No trespassing signs were posted, pro- hibiting our entry. The area was photographed using a digital video camera.

Phone: 513-588-4548 E-mail: ufo@fuse.net Website: UFO Research http://home.fuse.net/ufo/ Waynesville police officer was sighted in his car, parked at a service station. We approached the officer and explained our interest in the UFO sightings from this past week. The officer, Patrolman Christopher S. Wong, was only familiar with the reports of UFO sightings two nights in a row and was also aware that Wright Patterson Air Force Base had been alerted by the Warren County Communications Cen- ter. When asked if he had heard of any description'of the object, Patrolman Wong was only aware the object was circular or \"saucer-shaped\" with \"many lights circling it.\" One officer, he said, may have viewed the UFO through a spotting scope. Wong said he was unsure if the two Waynesville officers were able to videotape the UFO, but that the Ohio State Patrol officers might have been able to capture the UFO on videotape (Note: The \"iri-car\" video footage was requested for release from O.S.P. offices, but in a written statement dated May 16,2001, Jeff Maute, the Central Records Supervisor for the Ohio Department of Public Safety, said that no such video recordings were ac- quired by O.S.P. officers during the incident). History of the area Oddly, this same area was subject to some very bizarre UFO sightings in March and April of 1993, as documented by the late MUFON researcher Pat Packard. Talking with several people in the area, Packard learned of several in- stances of \"Flying Triangles\" sightings from an area near the Girl Scout Camp and Township Line Road. One dra- matic account, similar to that reported during the early morning hours of April 26,2001 near Genntown, involved an alarmed motorist claiming harassment from a pursuing UFO. One witness recounted to Packard that UFO sightings take place near Waynesville on a seasonal basis, seen in the area of her residence every spring. Packard, in discus- sion with me, stated at one point: \"Keep your eye on Waynesville. These people who live out there say that ev-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 July 2001 MUFON UFO Journal ery spring these things show up.\" The dramatic spate of UFO sightings near Waynes ville in 1993 drew to a climax on April 8 when police officers and prison guards of the Lebanon and Warren Correc- tional Institutes sighted a UFO hovering over the dual prison facilities. The object, first reported by citizens in the area before moving over the prison complex, was vis- ible to tower guards for an extended duration. According to The Cincinnati Post newspaper, an unusual sound was heard by inmates at the prison during the incident before the object departed to the north along Route 741, over the Qtterbein Retirement Village. Ruling out the likely suspects Various explanations have been considered to account for the unidentifiable nature of the April 24 UFO sightings. In the past, bright \"battlefield illumination\" or \"heat-seek- ing countermeasure\" flares discharged from military fighter jets have engendered UFO sightings in Ohio, Indi- ana, Michigan and Arizona. However, the Waynesville area is not in a MOA (Military Operations Area) zone where flare deployment is permissible. And although Air National Guard pilots have been suspected of violating MOA boundary restrictions (the March 26,1997, sightings in Southern Ohio and the April 6,1998, event near Evans- ville, IN, are two documented violation examples), the time frame of the Waynesville sighting exceeds the 8 p.m. time restriction for practice combat maneuvers. Further, the described appearance and ballistic conduct of the sus- pected UFOs were not consistent with either jet aircraft or flare deployment. Some .UFO sightings have been explained as hoaxes, possibly caused by flare or \"fire\" balloons. Two examples of hoaxes leading to UFO reports are the Middletown, OH, sightings during the summer of 1996, and the Gulf Breeze \"Bubba\" flare and fire balloons that acquired na- tional attention. With Waynesville, however, we are deal- ing with a completely different visual description suffi- cient enough to obfuscate this explanation attempt. Consideration has been given to the possibility that this situation was engendered by a misperception of routine stars and planets by both civilians and police officers on both evenings. This theory was first advanced by Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center, who was advised of the incident by the Ohio State Patrol while the sighting was in progress. The star Sirius was identified by Davenport as a likely candidate for misperception, but after sober review of the police tapes acquired from the Warren County Depart- ment of Emergency Services, this attempt at explanation is not looked upon favorably. The \"misidentified star sce- nario can be comfortably discounted due to observation of the object simultaneously from two vantage points: by one officer looking to the south from Waynesville and also sighted by a police dispatcher looking to the north from Lebanon. Further, as reflected on the police tapes, the officers involved cite specific distinctions between the stars and UFOs during the episode. In addition to headlighting situated in a straight tine (in- ferring a fixed structure), structural detail was specifi- cally afforded from an interview with the primary wit- ness, who said there was grid-work or \"cabling\" that en- cased the center light. It's structure was described by Chief Carter (and others) of the Waynesville P.D. as be- ing \"saucer-shaped\" with tights encircling it. Unless further information surfaces to shed light on this event, there may be reason to suspect that this hap- pening withstands any attempt at solid explanation.

Two of the individuals involved in this new study are Dr. Kary Mullis and Peter Khoury. Dr. Kary Mullis received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his discovery of the PCR technique. Mullis is unique amongst Nobel laureates in claiming that he may have had an alien abduction experience. He confirmed this to me and indicated others had similar experiences at his northern California cabin. See my article on Mullis' expe- rience at the CUFOS web site: http://www.cufos.org/ iur_Spring99_addendum.html Peter Khoury, whose 1992 experience with two enti- ties resulted in the retrieval of unusual strands of hair which could be analyzed, was born in 1964 in Lebanon. He migrated to Australia in 1973, met his future wife Vivian in 1981, and married her in 1990. They have two children. What might have been Peter's first encounter with a UFO occurred in Lebanon in the summer of 1971 at age 7. He and seven other children had gone up onto the flat rooftop of his neighbour's house to play. Peter was the last to walk through a heavy doorway that leads onto the roof. He then saw all his friends \"frozen\" like statues in front of him, while a silent egg-shaped craft hovered above. All eight children later found themselves on the ground floor after some time had elapsed, with no memory of the intervening period. hi Sydney, during February 1988, Peter and Vivian saw a strange light doing extraordinary movements in con- junction with a beam of light effect. A frightening experience A frightening and lif e changing alien abduction experi- ence occurred on July 12,1988. Khoury was lying on a bed and was overwhelmed by paralysis. A number of beings became apparent around him. One of them, a tall thin golden yellow coloured being with large black eyes inserted a long needle-like object into the side of his head. Khoury blacked out. He regained consciousness with a start and rushed into About the Author Born in Grafton, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, in 1952 and educated at the University of New England, Bill Chalker gradu- ated with an Honours Science Degree (B.Sc. Hons.) with majors in chemistry and mathematics. He lives in Sydney, Aus- tralia, and has more than two decades ex- perience in industry as a chemist, laboratory manager, and quality manager. He is one of Australia's leading UFO researchers, has written extensively on the subject, and is a contributing editor for the International UFO Reporter. His book on the Australia UFO experience, The OZ Files: the Australian UFO story , was published in Australia by Duffy & Snellgrove in 1996. His address is: P.O. Box 42, West Pennant Hills, NSW, 2125, Australia. (Please note that his email address: bill_c@bigpond.com has an underscore between \"bill\" & \"c\".) the adjoining room, where he found other family mem- bers in a \"switched-off\" state. Rousing them, Khoury dis- covered that while they thought only some 10 minutes had passed, in reality it seemed that between 1 and 2 hours had passed. An injury to his head was verified. At that time Peter Khoury had no real context to an- chor his disturbing experience. Eventually he became aware of abduction experiences and entered the UFO field to initially understand what happened to him. Even- tually, frustrated with the problems and politics that plagued his association with ufology, he formed a support group, the UFO Experience Support Association (UFOESA) during April, 1993. Despite trying to focus on supporting others, Peter found mat strange experiences had continued for him. In retrospect, the most striking one occurred on July 23,1992, according to diary entries. He had been recovering from head injuries received in a job site assault (he worked in the building industry in his own cement rendering business). At about 7 a.m., having returned to his Sydney suburban home from the train sta- tion, after dropping off his wife, Khoury felt unwell and lay down on the bed to sleep. He awoke with a start sometime later, becoming aware of something alighting on the bed. He was shocked to see two strange women kneeling on the end of his bed. Both were naked. One appeared Nordic and the other Asian. Aspects of their appearance were quite odd. The Nordic female had a very elongated face and a sharply pointed chin. Her eyes appeared to be blue and 2 to 3 times larger than normal. She had very fine wispy"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Page 8 July 2001 MUFON UFO Journal blonde hair that seemed to be oddly blown up. Her skin colour was quite light. The dark brown-skinned Asian look- ing woman seemed to have almost completely black eyes. Her hair was black and set in a firm page-boy style. Although no normal communication occurred, the Nor- dic woman seemed to be in charge, and Khoury got the impression she was giving the Asian looking woman some sort of instruction. What followed was quite disorientat- ing for Khoury. Very strong The Nordic woman, who seemed to be over 6 feet tall and apparently very strong, reached forward and pulled Khoury's head to her breast. He resisted, trying to pull away. She did this three times. Finally Khoury, trying to cope with the shock and disorientating nature of this ex- perience, bit on her nipple, apparently swallowing a piece from it. The Nordic woman, although seemingly confused, did not react with any pain, nor was there any sign of blood. She seemed to convey to the other woman that this was not the way things were supposed to happen. Khoury was overcome with a coughing fit. Moments later, look- ing up again, he found that both women had vanished. The coughing caused Khoury to go to the bathroom to get a drink of water. When he went to urinate he found it very painful to do so, due to, it turned out, some very fine blonde hair wrapped tightly under his foreskin. Khoury removed the hair and had the foresight to place it in a plastic sachet bag with a seal. He did that because he felt there was no way it should have been there, since it was unlike his wife's hair. Khoury concluded that something extraordinarily bi- zarre had just occurred and linked the two pieces of blonde thin hair (about 10-12 cm & 6-8 cm long) to the strange tall, blonde haired Nordic looking woman. Even though Vivian had been very supportive of him about his 1988 abduction experience, Peter refrained from telling her what had occurred for about two weeks. She accepted it far better than Peter did, telling him it was something he has no control over, and they would deal with it as best as they could. Other experiences Like many other abductees, Peter Khoury has had a number of experiences. During November, 1996, while lying in bed with Vivian beside him asleep, he felt an en- ergy presence intruding into the room. He opened his eyes and saw what seemed to be several hooded small figures (similar to his 1988 experience) appearing to come through the mirror. As they came closer, Peter experienced pa- ralysis and felt he was being floated horizontally feet first towards the mirror. Touching the surface of the mirror with his feet felt like he was going into water, like a change of density, not something solid. Khoury felt a sense of electrical static buzzing right through his body. He watched as the reflection of his head approached his face. As soon as they touched, he blacked out. He did not remember anything else other than wak- ing up in the bed again. There were other episodes in about 1994 or early 1995 involving a light burst or sound of an explosion, this being witnessed in part by Vi vian. On another occasion he felt a \"pins and needles\" paralysis developing. He tried to wake Vivian, and was eventually after great difficulty able to touch her. She woke up and simultaneously it was \"like somebody ripped the sheets off me.\" Peter said it was as if something was sucked out of him. The feeling had been engulfing him and as soon as he touched Vivian the feeling was gone. Between 1996 and 1999 Khoury is unaware of any expe- riences. In 1996, Peter was hypnotically re- gressed by Pulitzer prize-winning Harvard psychiatrist John Mack to try to clarify the 1988 expe- rience. Under Mack's regression Peter described being taken into an illuminated room. He was on a table with one entity above him, speaking to him, but with a sound like birds chirping. It was one person-a shadowy tall figure-but the sound seemed like 50 of them. Peter thought at the time, how was he going to remember what the entity told him. The recollection faded and everything went dark again. That was all that came out in the session. Peter has had a couple of regression sessions. He is not really satisfied with any of the hypnotic recollections and feels more comfortable with the consciously recol- lected details, such as those of 1988 and 1992. . Because of the bizarre and controversial nature of the 1992 episode. Peter was more comfortable describing his 1988 experience. The 1992 strange encounter with the two unusual women was discussed and examined in a limited and fragmentary way. The hair sample It was not until 1996 that I heard from Peter about the hair sample that had been recovered from what may have been an alien abduction sexual assault case. By 1998,1 began an investigation into the hair sample, when bio- chemical colleagues agreed to undertake what was the world's first PCR (polymerase Chain Reaction) DNA profiling of biological material implicated in an alien ab- Peter Khoury"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 2001 Page 9 duction experience. The analysis confirmed the hair came from someone who was biologically close to normal human genetics, but of an unusual racial rype-a rare Chinese Mongoloid type -one of the rarest human lineages known, that lies fur- ther from the human mainstream than any other except for African pygmies and aboriginals. There was the strange anomaly of it being blonde to clear instead of black, as would be expected from the Asian type mitochondria! DNA. The study concluded, \"The most probable donor of the hair must therefore be as (Khoury) claims: a tall blonde female who does not need much colour in her hair or skin, as a form of protection against the sun, perhaps because she does not require it.\" The original DNA results were reported in detail in the following reports: \"Strange Evidence,\" International UFO Reporter (IUR), Spring, 1999 issue, Vol.24,Nol,pgs. 3-16,31.

The IUR report includes the full analytical report and methodology of this initial phase of the work. The original DNA work was done on the shaft of the hair. Fascinating further anomalies were found in the root of the hair. Two types of DNA were found, depending on where the mitochondrial DNA testing occurs, namely confirming the rare Chinese type DNA in the hair shaft and indicating a rare possible Basque/Gaelic type DNA in the root section. More recent findings This was very puzzling and controversial until a \"Na- ture Biotechnology\" paper appeared in 2000. It revealed recent findings on hair transplanting with previously in- compatible hair, using advanced cloning techniques, de- veloped in a possible cure for baldness. We seem to be seeing similar combined or \"grafted\" DNA in the sample recovered under controversial circumstances by Peter The blonde entity (copyright APEG/UFOESA) Khoury back in 1992. Perhaps even more controversial is that we have find- ings suggestive of nuclear DNA indicating possible viral resistance. The hair sample seems to show it contains two deleted genes for CCR5 protein and no intact gene for normal undeleted CCR5. This CCR5 deletion factor has been implicated in AIDS resistance. To keep a very complex story somewhat uncompli- cated, what seems to be suggested by the range of find- ings is possible evidence for advanced DNA techniques and DNA anomalies & findings, for which we are only now discovering or starting to make sense of in main- stream biotechnology. A detailed follow-up report focus- ing on these new results is being completed. Connections with ancient cultures? The nature of these genetic findings has led to some interesting possible connections with ancient cultures, myths and archaeological finds, such as the strange Taklamakan mummies in China—tall European-like peoples (Celtic?), some of whom had blonde hair—and the stories of the female Basque God Mari and the Gaelic Irish tales of the Tuatha da Danann. The Tuatha tales describe powerful gods with orange or blonde hair and other unusual attributes. While such cultural and mythic connections are fascinating specula- tions, they provide for an interesting perspective on the many stories of Nordic type beings implicated in UFO abduction and contact cases. The records from ancient Ireland describe a whole series of invasions. The \"Lebor Gabala Erren\" (\"The Book of the Taking of Ireland\" or the \"Book of Invasions\"), compiled during the 12th century A.D., describes the com- ing of the mysterious Tuatha de' Danann or Tribe of Danu. They were apparently tall, blond or red-haired strangers, \"expert in the arts of pagan cunning,\" who supposedly interbred with the locals, while teaching them many kinds of useful skills. The Lebor Gabala records their dramatic entrance to Ireland as follows: \"In this wise they came, in dark clouds from northern islands of the world. They landed on the mountains of Conmaicne Rein in Connachta, and they brought a dark- ness over the sun for three days and three nights. Gods were their men of arts, and non-gods their husbandmen.\" According to the mythic tales, the Tuatha de' Danann were advanced enough to arrive in western Ireland (near modem Connacht) by air. They divided into two social classes: \"gods\" as teachers of medicine, smithing, com- munication or druidry, and \"non-gods\" as farmers or shep- herds. Although no one knows for certain what the Tuatha looked like, descriptions, such as of their female war-leader Eriu, indicate tall attractive people with pale skin, high foreheads, long red hair and large blue eyes. Other de- scriptions indicate blonde, golden hair with blue eyes. The"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 July 2001 MUFON UFO Journal blonde haired woman in the 1957 abduction of Antonio Villas Boas also had red body hair (pubic hair). She seems remarkably like Peter's female visitor and the description of Eriu. If the Tuatha cross-bred with local humans, they would have left hybrid descendants who look somewhat like themselves. Further focused DNA analyses of biological samples implicated in alleged alien abduction experiences will help determine the reality behind the claims of abductions and the validity of speculations driven by DNA, historical, cul- tural and mythic connections. Specialized equipment Some limited funding has permitted the purchase of specialised equipment to further this fascinating and groundbreaking work. Funding has permitted a DNA re- search presence, co-ordinated by the APEG, in a friendly laboratory facility. The equipment includes the PCR Ex- press system, imaging and data transfer equipment, specialised freezer and centrifuge plus controlled waterbath/gel processing equipment, and PCR & DNA consumables (chemicals etc). Further funding of this re- search is encouraged. Please contact me for details. Many abduction cases exist where alleged biological evidence has been reported. Few of these cases have been the subject of investigations that try to adequately address the question of whether such evidence supports or refutes the possible alien reality behind such experi- ences. Such events lend themselves to an established fo- rensic DNA profiling technique, which could help estab- lish the credibility of such claims. Since most abduction cases imply a measure of un- wanted assault on the victims of such experiences, a fo- rensic approach towards verification of the alleged per- petrators is desirable. Since DNA is the only building block of life that we know, biological specimens recovered in alleged abduction cases would provide researchers with a clear point of comparison. A key claim by many abduction researchers is that abductions involve some form of genetic agenda. This scenario would require compatibility between aliens and humans. The claims of sexual encounters are alleged to add further support to this scenario. This very element amongst the extraordinary range of fantastic claims made about abductions is one of the major stumbling blocks to the credibility of abduction claims. Mainstream science argues that if alien life exists it is unlikely to be compatible with human life. Hence any claims to the contrary, such as alien abductions, are re- garded as absurd. Therefore this limited and focused DNA profiling technique goes to the very heart of one of the key claims behind the alleged alien abduction agenda. It provides an opportunity for testing such claims. If these claims are true then there should be some com- patibility in the DNA of alleged alien specimens, but some possible anomalies may be evident that would perhaps Video available The images of Chalker and Khoury used in this ar- ticle come from a video produced by Diane Harrison & Robert Frola of the Australian UFO Research Network, entitled \"UFO Abductions and science,\" based on a lecture Khoury and Chalker gave in Brisbane, Queensland, on Oct. 7,2000.

One established way of undertaking this is to undertake such analysis with the goal to establish a pre- cise DNA base sequence of mitochondrial hypervariable region I, spanning nucleotides 16,000 to 16,400 of mito- chondrial DNA. Such DNA is present in hundreds of copies within each human cell, and therefore acts as an easily amplified ge- netic marker for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), even in moderately degraded samples, i.e. measuring the DNA variability beyond the documented \"human consen- sus\" of the region of DNA hypervariabih'ty. This technique has been tested in only one abduction case to date, the one involving Peter Khoury in 1992. This case confirms the utility of the DNA forensic ap- proach, but the real challenge ahead for researchers is to determine if these anomalies are both valid and signifi- cant. To do this, researchers in the controversial area of abductions should cooperate with a testing programme focused on this specific area of DNA profiling. Database of biological evidence Testing of a significant number of legitimate samples would provide an opportunity for validation of the unusual anomalies found to date. The further results would add to the database of biological evidence of alleged alien speci- mens. Such a strategy could help to determine if aliens are a biological reality and if indeed any are visiting our planet and abducting humans. Perhaps such information could also provide for an in- teresting perspective on the many stories of Nordic type beings implicated in UFO abduction and contact cases. The Anomaly Physical Evidence Group (APEG) has been formed to focus attention on biological strategies in abduction investigations. As noted, preliminary funding has facilitated a small laboratory presence addressing this exciting area. The APEG can be contacted through this writer at P.O.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This certainly is an unusual book. Written as fact, it reads almost Uke fiction. Adams, a cattleman from Mis- sissippi, describes his surprising experiences after finding one of his cows mutilated and trying to discover who or what did the deed. He describes the mutila- tion as follows: \"I noticed an unusual in- cision just back of and above her left front leg. Moving closer and bending over the cow I saw a circular incision going deep into her body! The hole looked like a well into her body; it was six inches in diameter, extended through the rib cage, and ended with a very large cav- ity where the heart was sup- posed to be. The rib bones had been severed with pre- cision, the heart was missing, and no blood or other body fluids filled the opening.\" He continues, \"The incision extending into her heart cavity was perfectly round, circling all the way to the bottom. The hide, flesh, rib bones, heart, and veins had been removed along the way, leaving a precise circular entrance to the heart cavity. A geometically perfect tri- angle was taken from the northeast section of the open incision. The length of the base of the triangle coinciding with the circumference of the open wound, was about four inches. Each side of the triangle was eight inches long and came to a precise point. The triangle was well balanced with no jagged, uneven, or torn places.\" Adams recalls, \"I saw that the udder had been sev- ered and removed. The method of removal was excep- tional in that it was done in the form of a perfect circle with no tears. There was no blood to be seen, but there was a dark hue around the very edge of the circumfer- ence. This dark color made the hide look Uke it had been cauterized or microscopically burned.\" He noted that fire ants had balled up on the very edge of the lower eastern comer of the incision. They intended to feed on the carcass, but most of the ants were dead, with the rest sluggish. The rest of the cow showed no cuts, bruises, rope marks, or evidence of a disease. A few feet from the cow in every direction there was a very heavy cover of vegetation. None of it had been bent or broken. Her body was outside the pasture, and no Uvestock roamed this area. Adams provides a great deal of background informa- tion regarding the raising of cattle, rather minute details regarding his search for the missing cow, and detailed experiences at the local sale barn, using this to set the stage for some highly unusual encounters. He vividly describes the strange circumstances in which he bought the cow in May of 1996, just a few weeks before the animal disappeared. He had selected five cattle to bid on from a group of 14 in a pen at the auction barn, but was somewhat concerned that one of the five, a gray heifer with red markings, had a minor amount of \"sleepy\" display in her eyes and a very slight nasal discharge. Closer inspection, however, revealed that she was healthy, and he decided to try to buy her. Suddenly a stranger appeared, described as \"a very slender forty-year-old man of dark complexion that had long, strong; arms, slender hands with power, and long fingers. His physical countenance of about six feet was of even design, and perfectly balanced. Nothing was de- fective or uneven. His forehead was sUghtly higher than normal, and each side of the head, just above the ears, expanded outward more than expected. This gave his head something of a balloon appearance, but because everything was so evenly proportioned, these variations were disregarded as just a blend with the whole person. His eyes were so bright they appeared lit up. It was pain- ful and difficult to look directly into his eyes.\" Adams describes the man as wearing \"a long-sleeve shirt and blue overalls. The fiber of both appeared as though the clothing had been often and frequently worn. Most would say that his clothing was worn out. The cloth- ing was perfectly clean, without grit or grime at all, pressed to perfection without any wrinkle, and a precise fit. His shoes were of the military combat type, except red in color. 'Like his garments, they were cleaned and poUshed as though to meet the approval of any critic. The leather on the front toes of both shoes had been damaged in small spots. These little worn-out places occur in tough leather when one walks through rugged terrain, such as places containing saw briars or barbed wire.\" The stranger asked, \"Do you plan to bid on any of the cattle in this pen?\" Adams recalls the words affecting him strangely: \"Though the words were only a simple question, somehow his expression and the tone of his voice made me uneasy about how to answer. I replied, 'Yes, but not all in the pen, only a few.' Hearing my reply he slowly looked back at the cattle. Suddenly without warn- ing or expectation the man went into a seizure-like trance, pointed into the pen, and exclaimed, 'That is the one that"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 July 2001 MUFON UFO Journal I want, that one, right there.' His voice sounded loud as if he were speaking into a pipe or culvert. His lips, slightly parted, did not move. His body vibrated with emotion. The cattle immediately lowered their heads, butting in or- der to move around in the pen. \"The one exception was that the gray heifer with a red tint raised her head above the herd and moved toward us. Her ears were thrust forward and her eyes were excited. She reminded me of a calf that had been released into a pasture with its mother after having been separated. This heifer was looking for its mother, but it came directly to the [stranger], and he was pointing directly at that cow with his left hand extended into the pen.\" The stranger then \"regained his composure with equal speed of the onset of the trance. He looked at me and grinned, almost a guilty appearance. Regaining my com- posure, I inquired, 'I should not bid on that cow?' His quick and definite response was in the order of, 'That is correct. I want that cow very much. Do not bid on that cow.' His voice was a very calm, educated, clear, and soft sound that characterized his first few comments. Immediately after the seizure, he looked momentarily ex- hausted, but within seconds he had fully recovdered and looked energetic and rested.\" The stranger then, \"for the next eight minutes, went into details of the prices cattle were bringing on the local as well as national level. I was so impressed with his knowledge, expressions, and clear voice that I began to wonder whether or not he was a college professor.\" However, as Adams was about to enter the main arena where the bidding takes place, the stranger \"suddenly trig- gered into seizure....With rump extended back, waist bent so that face and eyes were looking through several rails below the six-foot top, left hand extending slightly into the pen and pointing with one finger, his body became totally inflexible. His entire skeletal structure became locked, and there was a very brief body tremble instantly before he exclaimed, 'That is the one that I want, that one, right there!' \"The sound of the voice was not from the same man that had spoken only seconds before. It was loud, rasp- ing, everywhere in the environment, and as though he was yelling through a barrel! The cattle lowered their heads, butted each other, moved around in the pen as though to avoid danger, and seemed fearful. The one exception to all of this movement was the gray heifer. She raised her head above all of the others; and with ears cast forward, excitement in her eyes; took steps directly toward [the stranger], whose finger wa pointing directly in her direction. Though this acute activity took place in the pen, it lasted only about ten seconds. While momen- tarily remaining in this postion with finger still pointing into the holding stall, [the stranger] looked directly at me. His expression was one of, 'Did you get the message?' \"It was over. He stood, and with all stamina regained, looked back into the pen. The cows were being moved to sell; I must get into the arena because some of the ones selected might sell first.\" In the arena the stranger sat about 12 feet behind Adams, and to his left. Recalls Adams, \"He sighed and pulled his pants legs seveal inches above his knees. The side of the calf of his right leg had tiny scars that ex- tended in several random patterns all the way from the top of his shoes to about two inches below his knee. A hurried extimate would place the number at about thirty. The scars were much like the place that develops on one's arm after a smallpox vaccination.\" At this point the gray heifer had entered to be sold. Adams, who says he is more stubborn than the average man, decided, \"I will not let that man dictate policy to me! My selection of that one was before he appeared on the scene! He has no right to restrict what I need; I'll buy that heifer.\" . As Adams bid, the stranger bid higher, then Adams offered more. The price rose until it was noticeably be- yond market value, and other bidders were watching in wonder. \"It was suddenly over,\" says Adams. \"He stopped bidding; I had bought the cow! Slowly, with a very embarrassed feeling and submissive countenance, I turned to express an apology to [the stranger]: But he had accepted defeat. He stood, smiled, and bowed. He looked directly at me, smiled, and nodded his head in a friendly manner as though to say, 'It's all right; I under- stand. ' Having done this, he left the building.\" This gray heifer, of course, was the cow that was later found mutilated. Additional checking with the previous owner of the heifer resulted in Adams being told that the previous owner had also had a cow mutilated, but he had blamed this on a hunter, speculating that a hunter had made incisions in order to retrieve a bullet that could be traced. As though the described encounter with the mysteri- ous stranger was not enough, Adams recounts a second encounter at the cattle auction pens weeks later with a nother stranger who was younger, dressed differently, and was less friendly. However, the clothing was as wrinkle free as the first stranger, his red combat boots were like those worn by the first stranger, and, most importantly, he announced his selection of a cow in the similar strange manner as the first stranger. Adams could not remain at the auction barn to follow up on this animal, however. In late July of 1997 Adams reportedly had another en- counter of a very different sort. There is much more to this story, of course, and it is even more unbelievable, but I will leave this material for those who buy the book. If all of this is real-and I have no evidence that it is not-it is a fascinating, unusual, and possibly enlightening look at cattle mutilations."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 2001 Page 13 Filer's Files By George A.

Oregon flying triangle SGAPPOOSE - The witness was driving northbound on Highway 30 from Portland to Astoria, OR, on May 12, 2001, when he noticed a very bright yellow/white light de- scending. At 9:45 PM, just out- side of Scappoose he pulled his car off to the side of the high- way thinking it might be a me- teorite. As the car neared a hill, the object \"morphed\" into an ac- tual ship with bright lights. The lights were blinking within the trees, and the craft rose „ „ straight up. The witness says, treorge filer \"I pulled the car over again, in disbelief. It began moving as though it was going to cross the highway, so I got back on the road after two cars drove by. The craft, wider than the 4-lane highway and ten feet above the telephone wires flew directly over the cars. Both cars' brake lights came on, but neither stopped! \"I sped up, and as it crossed the highway anxiously looked for a road to turn down. I turned east onto a small road, crossed the RR tracks and sped up, all the while keeping my eyes on the craft, which I could see through the trees. It was now heading south at 20 to 25 miles per hour. The lights were blinking very brightly in an interest- ing rhythm, but there was no reflection on the actual craft, which was nearly invisible.\" The witness claims he saw the craft twice several months ago in Astoria, while his female partner saw it three times and took photos. \"The light patterns are very distinctive,\" he said. \"I got out of my truck and watched as the craft stopped and hovered approximately 1/10 mile east of me, and 50 feet up. There was no sound or move- ment. \"Strangely aware that they knew I was watching, I became frightened, and, legs shaking, got back in the truck, where my usually very active dog was sitting quietly. I drove about 20 feet, and then stopped when a car pulled up behind me. \"I jumped out of the truck and pointed, yelling, 'UFO!' They got out of their car and stood staring at the light as it zoomed off maybe 3 miles? The man said, 'I was in the government for years and that was no plane or helicopter either.\"' Thanks to NUFORC. Arthur C. Clarke sees life on Mars SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM — Sir Arthur C. Clarke, probably the world's most famous space author, spoke by phone from Sri Lanka on June 6 to the Wernher von Braun Memorial Lecture Series, telling the audience he believes that new images of Mars clearly show the red planet dotted with patches of vegetation, including trees. He feels this fact may spark new exploration of Mars. He and director Stanley Kubrick joined to produce \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Clarke claims to have studied im- ages from Mars taken by the now-orbiting Mars Global Surveyor on his home computer. Clarke encourges ev- eryone to have a really good look at these new Mars images. Clarke said. \"Something is actually moving and changing with the seasons that suggests, at the very least vegetation.\" There is something akin to Banyan trees in some Mars photos. Note: I personally have also studied these images and agree with Sir Arthur Clarke that there are signs of veg- etation evident in the photos. I had experience in photo interpretation while in the Air Force, and I think the water at the Martian Poles is melting in the spring and creating some kind of vegetation as it moves towards the equator. The color and branches appear similar to trees. In addi- tion, there also appear to be structures, possible earth mov- ing equipment, tunnels, and other indications of Martian Life. Having traveled to many of our Earth's pyramids, the D&M Pyramid on Mars is particularly intriguing. The five- sided pyramid reveals a structure that is contradictory with the surrounding geology. Neither volcanic nor other geomorphologic processes are likely to create a natural mechanism for the formation of an equilateral five-sided pyramid. Further, like our own pyramids, the structure is situated in a complex surrounded by other likely struc- tures. The pyramid is only part of the larger Cydonia com- plex. The structures have a similarity to the ancient King- dom of Kush in Sudan. We can speculate the Cydonia complex may represent some type of fortifications or re- ligious compound. The comers of the D&M Pyramid ap- pear to point towards the city at Cydonia and the Mars face. The pyramids on Earth are known to be structures built by intelligent beings; it seems logical that intelligence was needed to build or shape the D&M Pyramid. Additionally, the possibility of a tunnel complex on Mars creates even more interesting questions. The intricate relationships are so numerous that I must agree with Sir Arthur Clarke that the highly sophisticated designs indicates life on Mars."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 July 2001 MUFON UFO Journal MUFON FORUM Letters to Mufon UFOJoamar DearDwight: In discussing the 1993 case of Filiberto Caponi and his series of six photos of an anomalous creature, you write in your review of Unearthly Disclosure that Caponi \"at one point admitted [it] was a hoax, then changed his mind.\" More precisely, having been charged by the Carabinieri (Italian military police) with \"creating a panic and spread- ing false rumours liable to disturb the public peace,\" Caponi was coerced into signing a confession that he had fab- ricated the photographs. You correctly point out that Caponi \"seems to have the means (professional painter and ceramics arti- san) to have created the 'creature'...\", yet fail to mention that I commis- sioned a Law Society- checked Expert Witness, Professor Roger Green, to provide a thorough analy- sis of the photographs and to examine examples (in photographic form) of Caponi's paintings and terracotta work. Green concludes that \"the complexity of the evidence reinforces the idea that it is a genuine creature [which] does not really re- semble a terracotta model by Caponi\". You write that Capon i \"sold his photos to the highest bidder.\" While it is tnie that he considered doing so at one time, the original photographs have never been sold and are stored in a safety deposit box. I made copies of the originals and published them, together with Caponi's story, in my book. I did pay him a substantial fee, but had he been motivated by money alone he could have obtained a great deal more from a tabloid. I agree that video footage would have been helpful in assessing the authenticity of the creature (particularly in terms of its movements) but the Polaroid photographs reveal much more definition than would have been pos- sible with a camcorder. Regarding the white \"tubes\" protruding from the creature's sternum, you cite my reference to a \"1995 case in Puerto Rico [which] tends to corroborate the 1993 [Caponi] photos. But [Good] does not describe the 1995 Puerto Rican case...\" In fact, the incident - which I do describe - reportedly took place in 1989 but was not pub- lished until 1995. You write that \"12 pages are devoted to an unnamed 'senior reporter' who supposedly has access to an un- named \"senior Air Force officer\" as a source of informa- tion about alien bases on Earth and bodies from crashes. Again, documentation is lacking..:\" Not so. You fail to mention that the names and backgrounds of my sources are known to Lord Hill-Norton.. \"[Good] just seems never to meet a case or contactee he doesn't like,\" you state. That's nonsense: I remain highly sceptical of the majority of cases, including those involving abduction and contact. Finally, you refer to my \"generally poor choice and treat- ment of cases.\" I beg to differ. Incidentally, Unearthly Disclosure cost me over $50,000 to produce. Readers of the Journal can avail themselves of signed copies by sending a check for $36 to me, c/o 247 High Street, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 1 AB, U.K. Good wishes, Tim Good Response Professor Green, the investigator, said the following: \"Also, there are photographs of terracotta work by him [Caponi], using a clay which results in a similar colour to that of the creature. The contention may be that the crea- ture is, in fact, a terracotta model. An examination of the terracotta work reveals smooth surface textures what- ever the colour of the finished object. The brown teracotta objects are constant in colour, unlike the coloration of the creature, which varies from brown to white. To create this colour variation would either require careful painting, or, even more difficult, dyeing of the clay when mixed and before sculpting....The conclusion would be that, if a model, the creature has been painted.\" Dr. Green discusses the apparently fixed position of the \"creature\" as follows: \"The creature is seen to be in a similar sitting position in both pictures: The question arises as to whether or not the creature has moved in the inter- val between them [the two photos] being taken [a few moments, according to Filiberto-T.G.]....In Photo 4 there seems to be a small object, possibly a piece of wood, not far from the creature's upper thigh, and this also appears in Photo 5. Another object, near the right foot in Photo 5, does not appear to be present in Photo 4. Similarly, marks elsewhere in Photo 4 do not appear in Photo 5. There- fore, this suggests that the two photographs had a time interval between them.... \"The position of the various limbs of the creature can be compared in the two photographs. As much as may be gained from these, it seems that the relative positions have not changed perceptibly....The inescapable conclu- sion which may be reached, in comparing these two pic- tures is that, if they were taken at around the same time, then the creature has not moved much, if at all.\" Dr. Green summarizes his investigation as follows: \"It"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 2001 Page 15 is not possible, however, to determine the origination of such a creature from the images, whether 'man-made' or otherwise...Instinct suggests that the complexity of the evidence reinforces the idea that it is a genuine creature [which] does not really resemble a terracotta model by Caponi.\" So far as selling the photos to the highest bidder, Good's own subheading on page 145 is entitled \"THE HIGHEST BIDDER,\" and he reports, \"Filiberto decided to take his uncle's advice to sell the photographs to the highest bid- der.\" Copies of the photos were, as noted by Good, even- tually sold, and there is no indication that any higher amount was offered by anyone and refused by Caponi. The advantage that a Polaroid print has in offering more definition than a video camera pales in comparison to the value of a video in providing evidence that the creature could actually move. And why did Caponi not borrow a still camera which uses film and which provides a nega- tive that could be analyzed? For something so unusual, why not use more than one camera when successive en- counters occurred and were to some degree anticipated? In regard to the \"white tubes,\" the full \"description\" of the Puerto Rico case provided by Good is as follows: \"One night, early in November 1989, two boys were confronted by a hideous creature that jumped out of some bushes in the Rabanal area of Puerto Rico, between Cidra and Aibonito. Described as about three feet tall with brown hairy fur, two large gaping eyes, a couple of holes for a nose and two sharp fangs, the creature remained for a while underneath a street lamp, trembling and writhing as if in pain, and emitting queer noises. It then began foam- ing at the mouth and from several 'fleshy tubes' in its chest emerged a foamy, green liquid.\" This was taken from a 1995 article by Martin Jorge entitled \"Impossible Animals: What is going on in Puerto Rico?\" in Evidencia 0WV7,no.6. Good says, \"Though dissimilar from the Caponi crea- ture in some respects, this singular report in Puerto Rico provides a degree of corroboration for Filiberto's claims, inasmuch as it was first published (in Spanish) in 1995.\" Assuming that the 1995 report is reliable, there is virtu- ally no similarity in the two creatures. They look and act nothing alike, and the Caponi creature allegedly had two (not several) white (not flesh-colored) \"tubes\" which did NOT emit foaming liquid. To Good's credit, he includes both the positives and the negatives in his 70-page description of the Caponi case. Whether the author remains \"highly skeptical of the ma- jority of the cases, including those involving abduction and contact,\" is a matter of perception, and he provides no criteria. Good seemed sincere, honest, and open-minded when I discussed the case orally with him this spring. He is. a nice person, and I would very much like to provide a more positive review of his next book. , —Dwight Connelly Interacting with scientists Dwight, I was interested to read the respective responses of Stan Friedman and Richard Hall in the May Journal. Stan's response I think pretty much illustrates what our attitude has been, namely, that we think it is the problem of the scientific community if they haven't gotten the message. Stan has undoubtedly something like a world record in delivering the message, as he indicates. But I think Dick Hall's attitude is much closer to what has become my own, namely humility and self-reflection. We are in the presence of an immense and disturbing mystery. We certainly know more about this mystery than we did fifty years ago. Both Dick and Stan, senior UFOlogists, have helped to elucidate this mystery. But making real headway, as Dick says, will require resources greater than our own. The mainstream scientific community, as Stan says, also in- cludes the technical community involved in making space- craft, much of it way outside academia. Nonetheless I am much more concerned about con- tacts with, say, the International Astronomical Union, than I am with Lockheed. The engineering community, I be- lieve, has been far more open to our work than the scien- tists per se. But it is astronomers and exobiologists that I would like to involve in our dialogues. In the meantime there is a great deal we need to do to get our house in order. —RonWestrum   . An invisible wall Dear Dwight, I lived in Illinois for almost 40 years, and now live in Henderson, NV.'A few months ago I was walking slowly north in my back yard and I walked into an invisible wall. I felt it with both hands, and it was taller and wider than my reach. I felt like a mime. I also thought Ishould go back into the house. Knowing that most forces and many natural processes are invisible to the naked eye, such as gravity, centrifugal force, etc, I thought that the reference section of our lo- cal library could look it up in the new Star Trek Encyclo- pedia, to no avail. Since I was busy I did not call the library until today.   • • - , You may want to print all or any parts of this letter if anyone may want to theorize about this. —Russ Osantowski  :. 2000 MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS Theme: UFOs in the New Millennium in St. Louis, MO.

Mutual Unidentified Flying Object Network. We all understand what unidentified flying objects are, but let's look at the other two words: Mutual and Net- work. According to Webster's dictionary, Mutual-shared in common, enjoying their hobby, joint; Network-an inter- connected or interrelated chain, group, or system. Both mean something shared in common and interrelated; there- fore, the acronym MUFON. Pretty simple, huh? However, this is only partially correct. MUFON infor- mation has always been intended to be shared and, be- lieve it or not, a problem exists in that members do not know how to take advantage of, nor acquire, this shared (read \"mutual\") information. . In times past, it was quite a common thing to hear some- one say that all the information gathered by MUFON went into a \"black hole.\" This no longer has to be a true state- ment. Read on and find out how you can become a part of the \"network\" and learn the deep dark secrets of MUFON. The MUFON UFO Journal does a wonderful job of sharing articles and useful information, but this is only the tip of the informational iceberg available and being passed on to members. Why am I not receiving this information you ask? There is no communication from MUFON head- quarters, State Directors, State Section Directors; other members do not communicate with me; where is all this networking? There are those suspicions of deep dark se- crets again: it's not being passed on, it's still a secret, right? Wrong! It's right in front of you and available! The information is here We have a wonderful opportunity to correct this com- munications problem once and for all, and it's called WUFOb-Worldwide UFO Database. The WUFOD ad- ministrators, Don Weatherby and Wendy Ban, are doing their best to bring this data to all the members of MUFON. How can this be done? Very simply, via computer. Are you aware that each case entered into the WUFOD database is also sent to each SD, SSD, FI and FIT? As soon as a witness fills out a report and sends it to WUFOD, it automatically goes out to all of these members. And, even though that sounds like Utopia, unfortunately, it's not that simple. Bob Long, Assistant State Director of New York State, has volunteered his time and efforts to com- pile a list of all of the MUFON members who are on-line and have email addresses. Bob has done a wonderful job in a not-so-simple task. Providing an email list is somewhat like trying to catch the wind; members are not aware of how important that address is to them and, unfortunately, change addresses like you and I change socks, thereby making it virtually impossible to send out this vital email. It does Bob no good to put a member on the mailing list unless he has the correct address. I am going to use Florida as a prime example as to why WUFOD is not being used to its maximum capability. Florida has approximately 175 members. Of those, only 35 have email addresses that are listed with MUFON, and only 25 are using their Internet connection properly. Usually, when I (as State Director) send out information to all those on-line, approximately ten will not receive the message because their mailboxes are full and cannot ac- cept any fresh mail or, more commonly, because they have changed email carriers/addresses and failed to notify their state director of this change. Additionally, the actual number of members who have computers, are on line, and have as yet not given their email address to their State Directors is probably close to 50 or 60 percent. I would suspect that this is a conserva- tive figure. (Neither MUFON nor any State Director or SSD will use a member's email address for any purpose other than official MUFON business.) Communication is the answer All of these problems must be ironed out in order for us to accomplish our mission, and this can only be done through mutual networking and by communicating with each other. That communication can only be accomplished between members effectively with computers, and not US mail. When did you mail an important letter, and how long did it take to arrive at its destination? A lot longer than you would have liked, I'm sure. At thirty-four (34) cents for each letter, US mail is no longer a bargain. Even the \"penny\" postcard now costs you 21 cents, and that's no bargain either. Do you realize how fast an email goes from one com- puter to another? Much faster than it took to write this sentence. It only makes common sense to use email for communication. It is no longer a toy; the deep dark se- crets of computers which were conjured up in the past are now just mat, a thing of the past. Computers are here, my friends, and here to stay, I'm sure. Let's all become computer literate and begin to com- municate and network mutually.

C. Levengood, has become increasingly familiar to people interested in crop circles and related phenomenon. Although Levengood's expertise has pro- vided the majority of the scientific data presented at the BLT lectures, it is primarily Ms. Talbott who has recruited and trained field sampling personnel, raised funding to cover expenses and expand research ca- pabilities, and publicized the results obtained over the last eight years. Talbott has lectured widely in the United States, Canada and Europe, including the MUFON symposium and, most recently, at Lou Farish's.Ozark UFO Confer- ence, and is scheduled to speak at several upcoming con- ferences in England, Mexico and the U.S. later this year. She travels, as finances permit, to crop circle and other unusual phenomena sites both in the states and abroad to participate in arid oversee fieldwork and to gather samples and anecdotal data first-hand. Ms.Talbott was initially drawn into crop circle research because of her conviction that \"the crop circles-and other so-called 'anomalous' phenomena-offer a doorway through which a greater understanding of reality can be approached.\" When she learned, in the U.K. in 1993, that an American biophysicist was actually interested in crop circles too, she saw an opportunity to begin building an organization which would, hopefully, eventually attract other professional scientists as consultants and collabora- tors. \"Since scientific knowledge is now so extensive and so compartmentalized that no one individual can possibly be informed in all areas,\" she notes,, \"it seemed that of- fering a situation in which multiple scientists could col- laborate was the optimal goal. And, since the reporting and field-sampling network built to help explore the crop circle phenomenon includes many people interested in other little-understood arenas-many of which may be re- lated in some fashion-this field network could be utilized to gather data and samples at various unusual-event sites for examination by a number of consultants with differing capabilities.\" It is only in the past decade that Nancy has become involved in unusual phenomena research, but her organi- zational skills were utilized in the past. Following atten- dance at Johns Hopkins University and extension work at Harvard College, and subsequent employment as a re- search analyst in the graduate departments of anthropol- ogy and pyschology (also at Harvard), she began devel- oping a circuit of venues along the East Coast of the U.S. for bluegrass musicians from Appalachian Many of these musicians were, at that time, forced to work in the coal mines in order to make ends meet, a situation Talbott felt was both unhealthy for them and a cultural loss for the rest of the country. And since she had a \"daddy from Georgia and a mother from Massa- chusetts\" and some organizational talent, she thought per- haps she had the necessary background to \"bring real Appalachian music to the Yankees.\" After years of presenting bluegrass concerts to audi- ences in the Boston area and building up the number of tour dates the bands would play along the way North, she formed a non-profit company, Hazard Productions, Inc. Then in 1976, in a huge natural amphitheater oh a rented dairy farm in NY state, she put on New England's first major outdoor Appalachian music festival, The Berkshire Mountains Bluegrass Festival. That first year the festival lost an enormous amount of money and it seemed impossible to keep it going. But almost miraculously a new backer appeared and, by the third season, the show had broken even. By the 10th year the week-long annual event attracted 30,000 people, most of whom camped out in the fields at the farm all week with \"their kids, their grandmas and then\" banjos,\" and the Berkshire Festival had become the largest of its type in the world, with attendees from as far away as Japan and Australia. Nancy says she accomplished her real goals, which were to spread appreciation of this mu- sic and its culture outside the South (and particularly to Yankees) and to help raise the standard of living for the bluegrass musicians \"so they could quit working in the mines.\" Life-changing illness After 15 years as a music producer, a serious illness demanded, as she says, \"all my attention.\" It was while recuperating from multiple surgeries and chemotherapy that she first became aware of crop circles after seeing photos of them in a British magazine at the Harvard Square kiosk one night. \"Perhaps because of my interest in the arts, generally, the designs of the crop formations really struck me,\" she recalls. \"One of the Brits mentioned in the article was veteran crop circle researcher George Wingfield, so I got his num- ber and called him, suggesting that I set up a lecture tour for him here in the States in exchange for him taking me"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 July 2001 MUFON UFO Journal on a guided tour of the crop ckcles as soon as I could get to England. George took me up on it, and that's how I got started.\" While in England that next summer she learned that American scientist Wm. C. Levengood had already be- gun looking at plants from crop circles sent to him by British crop circle investigator Pat Delgado (co-author of Circular Evidence). Levengood had already discov- ered some interesting changes in the plants sent to him by Delgado, and Nancy, who had strongly suspected that the circles were not all manually-made, immediately wanted to know the details. A visit with Levengood As soon as she got back to the U.S. she called Levengood in Michigan and, shortly afterward, visited him in his lab. \"I wanted to see what he was doing and what he was finding,\" she explains. Once at the lab, \"It was clear to me from my years working in the anthropology and psychology labs at Harvard that he was pursuing the examination of the crop circle plants in a trained profes- sional manner and that he was intensely curious about the causative agency responsible for the abnormalities he was finding. I also saw that this man had the courage to pur- sue an interest that many scientists would be afraid to touch with a 10-foot pole.. .that he had what all real scien- tists have: genuine curiosity.\" In an effort to assist Levengood in obtaining field samples and in documenting the anecdotal details, Talbott volunteered her time, talent (\"such as it is,\" she says) and money. The organizational lessons learned from running the Berkshire Festival proved helpful here, and soon she was helping to establish a reporting and sampling net- work in several countries where crop ckcles were being discovered. John Burke (the \"B\" and third member of the BLT Team) had already become acquainted with Levengood, \"getting involved for the same reason I did, I think,\" says Nancy, \"the unique chance to study the phe- nomenon scientifically.\" In those days (the early '90s) Burke, Levengood and Talbott worked together, pooling resources in a serious effort aimed at both documenting the physical changes in the crop circle plants (and, later, soils) and in trying to understand the physical processes at work. The struc- ture of the group was completely informal, but became known as the BLT Research Team as other crop circle enthusiasts demanded a name for the group effort. Early research in the UK Early on Burke visited England with Talbott to carry out electrostatic voltmeter studies and to take readings of ground electrical change at the crop circle sites. Burke later spent many hours in libraries, scanning the published literature in an effort to assist Levengood in the develop- ment of a scientifically grounded hypothesis. Although there were a few people involved, when Talbott first met Levengood, she took on the responsiblity of organizing the fieldwork on an international.scale. In the next several years she recruited hundreds of volun- teers in eight different countries,\"getting several hundred crop formations sampled for the Michigan lab. \"Levengood is the scientist,\" she emphasizes; \"with hun- dreds of samples now coming into the lab each year, we didn't want to waste his time organizing the field effort.\" It was also extremely expensive to stay in contact with the growing number of fieldworkers and other people in- terested in the BLT effort, money which Nancy felt was well-spent. As Levengood's research progressed, he began writ- ing papers which were then published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. By 1999, three scientific papers had been written (Levengood, 1994; Levengood & Burke, 1995; Levengood & Talbott, 1999), covering the majority of the results obtained so far. Lab reports have been generated on each individual case studied, and Nancy has helped edit many of these, then mailed out thousands of copies of both the lab reports arid the published scientific papers to the interested public. She also has developed field sampling protocols and, several years ago began dealing with the media as inter- est in the BLT results grew. When various conference promoters began calling wanting to book a lecture on the BLT work, Nancy developed an extensive slide show/ lecture at Levengood's request. Scientist teaches non-scientist According to Talbott, the greatest challenge she has run into is understanding the science behind what Levengood has been doing, so that she can translate and present it accurately: \"He [Levengood] expects that people will understand certain basics in science. I had very little biology background and none to speak of in physics. So he has had to spend many hours trying to explain concepts to me which, to him, are obvious.\". Talbott says that this has taken a great deal of effort on her part, and that she suspects it has been \"downright painful\" for Levengood, enduring long phone calls often twice a week for the past eight years. However, she says the education she has garnered through this process has changed her perception of nature, \"awakening the realization of how incredibly complex and elegant the world in which we live is.\" In addition to the knowledge gained from hundreds of conversations with Levengood, Nancy has had many ex- periences in the field which have stretched her concepts of \"reality.\" In 1993, while in England on a sampling trip, she happened to discover a new formation at a site known as Overton Road. She was apparently the first one there and approached the long pictogram-type formation cau- tiously, standing just outside it's edges marveling at the undulating flow in the downed crop which she describes as looking like \"water rushing down a shallow mountain stream, eddying around rocks in it's path.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal July 2001 Page 19 Elaine Douglass and Ron Regehr, Utah state co-directors, presented a session in St. George, Utah, on May 5 which attracted 80 people, re- cruited four new members, and generated sev- eral leads. They were also written up in the larg- est area newspaper, and spent two hours on the radio. They report a side'benefit of getting to know SSD Eleanor Sanini much better. The crop looked soft and springy, and she was aware of a distinct reluctance on her part to enter-and conse- quently crush-the plants in the formation. After battling with indecisi veness as to whether to go into the main circle or not, she decided that it was her job to go in and begin sampling, in spite of the fact that this didn't \"feel\" exactly OK. While sampling, other people arrived, some of whom helped with the work, and by mid-afternoon they had taken the required number of samples. As Nancy was leaving the formation to take the plants to a nearby barn to dry, she suddenly turned to Canadian crop circle investigator Chad Deetken and a friend, saying \"I want you guys to come back here tonight and park up on Overton Hill, fac- ing the formation....because there's going to be an addi- tion.\" As she spoke the words she wondered what had made her say them, since she had no reason to even think, much less say, what had come out of her mouth. Paralyzed After dropping off the plants at the barn, Talbott re- turned to her nearby B&B to wash up. However, upon reaching her room, she fell onto the bed and for the next 24 hours was totally unable to move any part of her body. She states that her \"entire focus was on making my lungs work; it was all I could do to keep on breathing.\" During the nighttime she recalls wondering if there were hospitals in the area, then wondering if there were ambulances, then realizing that \"it didn't make much dif- ference, since I was completely unable to do anything to call attention to my situation.\" She thought she might ac- tually die, but says she felt oddly at ease with the idea. The next afternoon, just about 24 hours after collapsing on the bed, she was \"suddenly able to move\" again, and realized she felt more or less normal. After cleaning up she returned immediately to the Overton Hill site, to see what, if anything, had transpired. As she walked into the field she noted that both Chad and his friend were there, as were many other people. Chad immediately began to describe his return to the Hill that night with his friend, saying they had parked the car near the top of the hill, facing toward the crop circle which they could easily see in the moonlight. He related that, at about 2 a.m., they watched as a white misty fog began to roll in across the field in which the formation lay, seeming to become more dense as it approached the crop circle itself. \"Then, to both witnesses' total amazement,\" says Nancy, \"this fog took on the shape of a large white horse which then galloped directly across the formation and into the East Kennett longbarrow on the other side of the field. Chad knew that the East Kennett longbarrow was the only unexcavated longbarrow tomb left in southern En- gland, and both men were apparently so frightened they started the car and put it into reverse and then backed down a very narrow, steep hill into the village of Overton, rather than go forward, which would have taken them closer to the crop formation and the place where the 'horse' had just been. In spite of the fact that this story seemed absurd, and the men felt awkward telling it. Chad swore it was what had happened.\" A new circle Whatever had happened, says Nancy, \"Neither Chad nor his companion was willing to return to the field until well after daylight the next day. When they and some other friends did return, apparently some time aftern noon, they found that a brand new circle had, in fact, been added at the far end of the pictogram. And then, while all of these friends were standing inside the new addition, a small tuft of standing crop in the center of the circle sud- denly curled around on itself and went down—while they were watching.\" This had occurred not long before Nancy returned to the site, and everyone was talking about what they had just seen. The fact that Nancy had experienced such re- luctance to go into the original formation, the fact that she announced there was \"going to be an addition\" without any conscious knowledge of such an event, and her sub- sequent apparent paralysis may be related, she says, to \"some sort of unconscious awareness of the energy sys- tem behind the crop circles. It appears the energies, what- ever they are, were still residual in the area. Perhaps I recognized this presence intuitively.\" Another situation in which \"intuition\" seems to be in- volved is Talbott's involvement with a young man in the Netherlands who not only seems to often know when, and where, new crop circles will appear in his area, but"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 20 July 2001 MUFON UFO Journal who has now witnessed many of them actually forming. On several of Nancy's visits to Holland to stay with the family, brilliant light phenomena have occuired in her pres- ence which she cannot explain. \"Many of the circles,\" explains Nancy, \"which have been witnessed as they occurred have involved balls of light or light-forms hovering over the crop surface, and these formations, when sampled and subsequently tested in the lab, have revealed the same plant and soil changes found regularly in crop circles all over the world. And in many of these cases Robbert, the young man involved, somehow 'knows' they are about to happen. An energy connection? Nancy continues, \"Although it is not currently under- stood how he is alerted to these events, it seems clear that there is some sort of connection between him and the energies involved, and a study is planned which may may provide some answers.\" In 1998, in order to qualify for financial support from New York philanthropist Laurance Rockefeller, Ms. Talbott incorpoorated BLT Research Team Inc., obtaining non- profit, tax-exempt status for the new corporation. She has also succeeded in attracting several new con- sulting scientists to the group with expertise in geology, mineralogy, chemistry, x-ray diffraction, infrared spectros- copy, scanning electron microscopy, electron dispersive spectroscopy and statistics. A large-body veterinarian has also indicated his interest in examining unusual ani- mal death cases. New study provides significant results BLT Inc's most recent project, a soil study in which specific clay minerals in the soils at crop circle sites have been examined by x-ray diffraction to see if the crystal- linity has been altered inside the circles relative to the control*, has resulted in the discovery that the crystalline structure is in fact, increased \"This finding is statisti- cally significant at the 95 Vr level of confidence (a level accepted in scientific studios around the world),\" says Nancy. \"Furthermore, when Levengood's plant data (increased plant stem node-lengths in the crop circle plants) was com- pared to the soil results, a significant correlation was found between node-length increase and increased clay-min- eral crystallinity, at the 99% level of confidence.\" These results rule out manual flattening of the plants in crop formations as an adequate explanation for the phe- nomenon, and support the results published by Levengood, Burke and Talbott over the past 10 years. When Ms. Talbott was asked about Colin Andrews' pronouncement in the summer of 2000 that 80% of crop circles are man-made, she replied, \"Of the approximately 350 crop formations sampled and studied in the lab, many of which were British events and some of which were complex 'geometric 1 designs, fewer than 10% appeared to be man-made.\" She further expressed the wish \"that people would stop making definitive statements about the crop circles be- fore they have produced the data needed to back up such claims, because superficial remarks ultimately dam- age both serious research and the public's ability to evaluate which claims are well-founded and which are simply sen- sationalistic.\" She explained that \"no one knows for cer- tain what percentage of crop formations worldwide are the real McCoy; we only know about the ones which have been properly sampled and evaluated in the lab.\" In recent years John Burke has not been involved in the BLT Inc. effort, notes Talbott, his time spent instead fine-tuning a piece of equipment patented by Levengood & Burke in April, 1998, which enhances seedling growth characteristics by exposing seeds to organized electron avalanches. A few months ago Levengood decided he wanted to pursue his various research interests on his own again, choosing to function in the lurure as a \"consultant\" to BLT Inc. Says Talbott, \"Levenaood has laid the founda- tion for a dozen future BLT Inc projects if the money can be found to carry them out.\" This long-term collaboration of three seriously inter- ested individuals, backed up by a large international re- porting and sampling network of trained fieldworkers, has contributed conclusively to the knowledge available to the public about crop circles, unusual animal deaths, and UFO trace-cases-both through in-house lab reports and in peer- reviewed scientific journals. Now, with the availability to BLT Inc. of multiple new scientific consultants, who offer a variety of disciplines and technical capabilities, Talbott intends to continue \"as- saulting the doors of the establishment\" with scientifically- documented \"hard data\" obtained in the study of what- ever physical evidence comes across her path. She says she often feels like \"one of the Greeks besieging the gates of Troy,\" particularly when dealing with mainstream me- dia. However, with the strong results obtained from the new soil study, a fourth scieniific paper is in progress, and two new and very intriguing projects are taking shape. \"Calls come in every wee k, sometimes every day,\" says Talbott, \"from new people who have just had their eyes opened to the fact that something real is going on.\" Nancy concludes, \"It took a lot of Greeks, and of course the Trojan Horse....but the Greeks did, after all, prevail.\" Contact info: Nancy Talbott BLT Research Team Inc.

The stance adopted in the UK-where in many places regression is simply banned altogether-is one of the most controversial aspects to this issue, and I thought I would take some time to explain why we do things this way. It is no mere whim. Reasons to be fearful Firstly, I should emphasise that hypnosis has been quite widely used in the researching of British close encounters, and in some quarters still is. There is no blanket ban. I, personally, have had quite a lot of involve- ment with cases that have used regression, although none as an investigator for many years because I now support the ban. My reasons are similar to those more generally behind the attitude of British UFOlogy and are based on three primary factors. Firstly, many witnesses have told me that the use of regression has not made them feel better, but, if anything, worse. Secondly, my observations of cases in the field and my own personal experience of being regressed (both to an alleged past life and to a LITS UFO sighting) leaves me well aware of the serious pitfalls of the technique. But, thirdly, I have seen genuine risk to witnesses and signs of misinterpretation of the evidence that stems from the use of regression. These may be my personal reasons for not supporting its use, but I have, from time to time, sat in on even fairly recent cases where regression has been used (under care- ful medical supervision). This is still done by groups and researchers in the UK who do not adhere to the ban. I should add that these experiences have not altered my view that it is right to be concerned over the widespread use of regression in the UFO field. A brief history The first use of regression hypnosis in a British case dates to the 1960s, during the follow up of a famous inci- dent-the sighting by the crew of a BOAC stratocruiser whilst flying over Goose Bay, Labrador, nearly 40 years ago. This case puzzled the Condon report and also in- trigued the British government of the day. During interviews that we did for the TV show \"Strange But True?\" (with which I was very closely involved throughout), we secured frank recollections by several of the air crew which indicated both the extent of the Air Ministry interest and of how regression hypnosis was used during later efforts to bring out fresh recall of the matter. It does not seem to have significantly added to the story, but it is important to realise that this method was used in a British UFO case about the same time as it first was employed in the US as Betty and Barney Hill were re- pressed by Dr Benjamin Simon. So we are not latecom- ers 10 the possibility of its use. The first time it formed part of the investigation of a possible British abduction was in 1977 when the two adult members of a family that had lost time afte r d n v i ng into a bank of green mist at Aveley, Essex, were repressed. I sat in on one of the early sessions and had chance to interrogate the mother of the young children (who were not regressed) whilst under hypnosis. This first direct ex- perience provided me with an important warning. After 1978 the use ol regression became widespread in the UK, as it did in (he US Any case that hinted at missing time was subject 10 the suggestion of regression, and this often did follow. Quite a few major abductions emerged from otherwise inconclusive conscious testi- mony. The best known is probably the abduction from his patrol car of police officer Alan Godfrey amidst one of the most active UFO window area in Britain-at Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Whilst the Godfrey case and a few others were con- ducted by well-qualified medical doctors with experience in hypnosis, this was far from always true. In fact, many regressions were of the self taught/cut price/do-it-your- self method-employed by UFOlogists and groups because they could not afford to pay the often hefty fees to em- ploy professional doctors. UFOlogy in Britain lacks the scientific support that groups like MUFON have. In the early days in particular it was often a case of do it yourself or don't do it at all. The potential value of regression sesssions operated by less than qualified people began to concern some of us, not to mention the risks they posed to the witness. Often people were literally allowing unqualified UFO buffs who had watched someone else do hypnosis and \"picked it up\" the skills mess with their heads, with who knows what long term repercussions? The turning point There was a growing concern amongst the fairly mod- erate and cautious British UFO community. After a few of us had conducted research into the scientific contro- versy and reported back that hypnosis was known to sumu-"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Page 22 July 2001 MUFON UFO Journal late fantasy almost as much as it facilitated the release of subconscious memory, the extent of the problem was al- ready being debated. Were we diluting the value of the consciously recalled evidence, it was asked. Did we have a desire to find more dramatic and commercial alien contact cases that were flooding out of the US within sightings that were strange, but otherwise not recalled as being alien contacts? Some of us began to fear that in this mad rush to get \"better\" evidence we were potentially compromising the reality status of the data (since the abduction part of the story, being so exciting, tended to get over-emphasised, whereas it relied on at best contentious methods rather than the under-emphasised-but probably more trustwor- thy-conscious recall). This provoked the writing of a clause about regression hypnosis into the Code of Practice that was defined in the UK in 1982 by a series of meetings across the country. In these, local and national groups came together on this common project to create a self regulatory code of eth- ics. One of the many clauses insisted that regression hyp- nosis should only be conducted under proper medical su- pervision-i.e. an end to the UFO buffs doing their own hypnosis after reading a couple of \"how to do it\" books. This code was ratified by several (but by no means all) major UK groups. Some local groups signed it too. Oth- ers declined. Of national organisations, BUFORA, the British equiva- lent of MUFON as a nationwide and long-standing mem- bership group, fully approved it. Indeed they went further than most, making the code mandatory to all members if they wished to join the society. Ironically the only investi- gator who declined to sign (and thus had to leave the team) is today best known as a skeptic! Then something happened. During a hypnosis session with a witness who was taken back to the day he had been \"zapped\" by a lightbeam when a young child, the witness had a form of epileptic seizure. Although this was not a BUFORA investigation, the incident sent a Shockwave through that group's investigation team. We discussed whether we really needed to do more than merely regulate against hypnosis. We decided that we should send a message lo UFOlogy. That positive action was required.

Not only does this keep us better informed, but occasion- ally there will be news from the local groups that de- serves national/international coverage. 2001 MUFON SYMPOSIUM Hyatt Regency Irvine Hotel, Orange County, California www.mufonoc.org (Updated Speaker Topics) Friday, July 20 6 p.m.-9.p.m. Buffet Reception Saturday, July 21 9 ajn.

The ruddy planet moves westward, setting in the WSW about 12:30 a.m. (midmonth). Bright Planets (Morning Sky): The two brightest planets, Venus (-4.0) and Jupiter (-2.0), come within a degree or two of each other on Aug Sand 6 Look for the pair in the E during twilight. In mid-Au^ii 1 -! Venus rises shortly before 3 a.m.; Jupitei. aboui 2 a m The lunar crescent adds to the scene on the 16th. Saturn (-0.3), in Taurus, rises in the NE about 12:30 AM in midmonth, rising to a point high in the ESE by dawn. Saturn lies near the crescent Moon on Aug. 14. Meteor Shower: Unfortunately, after midnight on August 11-12, the last quarter Moon interferes with the maximum of the Per- seids meteor shower, reducing the normal rate seen of 50 to 100 meteors per hour. The annual shower can be ob- served in fewer numbers on either side of the peak, from late July to late August. Face on Mars II: It has been 25 years since the Viking 1 orbiter snapped the controversial picture of a feature on Mars resembling a human face. In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor took an- other image of the structure, 10 times sharper than Viking's, clearly revealing a natural mesa, not an intelligently cre- ated alien monument as some thought. The 1998 photo should have ended the mystery. Just to be sure, this past April MGS took an even sharper image of the 800-foot-high mesa, confirming the first finding. Showing objects as small as a car, this latest image breaks down the \"face\" completely, showing it to be only one of many mesas and buttes littering the plain of Cydonia.

Not a true constellation diib \\ ery obvious right triangle is com- posed of the brightest stars of three constellations. Vega, third brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere night sky, is situated in Lyra the Harp. Look for a crooked rectangle. Because of the slow precessional wobble of the Earth's axis, Vega will be our North Star in 12,000 years. This also is the first star ever photographed (1850). E of Vega lies the star Deneb, tail of Cygnus the Swan. Cygnus often is nicknamed the \"Northern Cross,\" with Deneb located at the top of the cross. Altair forms the southern corner of the Summer Tri- angle, marking the head of the Eagle Aquila. With some care, it is possible to discern the bird's two outstretched wings and pointed tail. The Eagle and Swan fly in oppo- site directions along the Milky Way. Jul> 20-22, MUFON 2001 Inrem.monal UFO Sym- posium, Hyatt Regency Irvine, Ir\\me CA. Theme: Join- ing the Cosmic Neighborhood.

Special Grant Supports MUFON's Outreach Project Throughout the history of the organization the MUFON UFO Journal, and SKYLOOK before it, has brought the i e^ulis of UFO investigations, research projects, and or- ^jmzation activities to MUFON members throughout the world. Even so, we have always felt that this informa- tion should go to a much larger audience, and in 2001 we identified three groups to be recipients of the Journal: all U.S. Senators, all U.S. Representatives, and all major news outlets. Thanks to a generous donation from Dr. Bob Hieronimus and Zoh Meyerhoff Hieronimus (www.futuretalk.org and www.21 stcenturyradio.com) we are able to activate the first step of this project. All U.S. Senators will begin receiving the MUFON UFO Jour- John Schuessler niil with ihe July ixsue Our ouireach project ib, under- way. Your International Director has appeared a number of times on 21st Century Radio with Dr. Bob Hieronimus. He has generously given airtime on his vast network so that his listeners could hear about the real work of MUFON-what we investigate, how we investigate, and how seriously we take the issues surrounding this mys- tery. His very positive support is appreciated. We are looking forward to future visits with Dr. Bob on 21st Cen- tury Radio and with Zoh Hieronimus on Future Talk. We are still seeking grants for the second and third parts of our Outreach Project. New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director of Field Investigator Training, has announced the following Field Investigator Trainees have successfully completed the Field Investigator's Exam and are now MUFON Field Investi- gators: Gail Barton, Lakewood, CO; Jack Marino, Sun- rise, FL; and Debbie Ziegelmeyer, Imperial, MO. New T-Shirts and Hats As mentioned in the June issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, we are working the design and manufacture of a new \"Field Investigator\" T-Shirt. The plans have been finalized, and the new shirts along with matching caps will be available for the first time at the 2001 MUFON UFO Symposium in Orange County, CA, and by mail order fol- lowing the symposium. The shirts will be available in white with blue lettering or black with white lettering. Prices have not yet been determined. When does my membership/subscription expire? The answer to this question appears on the mailing label on each Journal (see example below) 01/05 Name Street Address City, State, Zip The first line on the label provides the answer. The first two numbers show the year of expiration (01 =2001, 02-2002, etc). The two numbers after the slash show the month of expiration and show the last issue that will be mailed (05=May,08=Aug, ll=Nov, etc.)."}]
