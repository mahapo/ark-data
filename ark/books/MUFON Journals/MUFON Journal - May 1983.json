FROM THE EDITOR With the introduction of canned \"UFOs\" and \"UFOs With Meteors\" by the Franco-American spaghetti company in the U.S., the subject enters \"pop culture\" status. All we need now is an Andy Warhol poster! UFOs have become as \"American\" as Mom, apple pie, and Chevrolet. They have become pasta in tomato sauce, to be eaten (obviously) by kiddies. The only surprise is that the breakfast cereal companies did not beat the pasta peddlers to the punch. The concept of UFOs has penetrated the public consciousness to an unprecedented degree; no close parallel comes to mind. But more as a joke, (something lighthearted and humorous; something to be exploited) than as a serious, scientific mystery which might have profound consequences for humanity. Pasta for the masses!

Boechc (Nebraska State Section Director) At approximately 10:30 p.m. on the night of December 11,1982, a series of UFO sightings began which would eventually involve six law enforcement officers and eight civilian witnesses. Three incidents occurred, each becoming stranger than the previous. Joe and Tauni Murnan live on a small farm about 7 miles northwest of Nebraska City, Nebraska. Employed by a manufacturing firm in Omaha, Joe also enjoys raising a small number of horses. These animals provided the first indication that something was happening. Kept in a fenced pasture about 200 feet east of the home, the horses had become \"spooked,\" and were galloping around the enclosure and whinnying. Joe glanced out an east-facing window and saw \"two purplish-pink objects a little larger than a car, bobbing up and down\" over his corral. He called Tauni and they watched for several minutes as the objects continued to hover over the horse's enclosure. Deciding they wanted other witnesses, Joe telephoned the Lyons, neighbors about a quarter of a mile east of his house. Phyllis Lyons answered the call, and Joe excitedly explained about the lights, and told her to \"look in the pasture.\" Mrs. Lyons mistakenly began to look in her own pasture and saw nothing. Switching off all of the lights in the house she continued to look, but again, in the wrong pasture. Joe, who had continued to watch the objects' while on the phone, had observed one of the lights move off to the southwest, and continue on out of sight, while the remaining object moved slowly north about 100 feet, and then began to descend into the pasture between his home and the Lyons'. As he watched, the object dropped behind the crest of a steep hill which marked the beginning of his pasture and remained out of sight for about a minute. Joe thought that it may have landed briefly. Subsequent investigation revealed 'no physical evidence that a landing had occurred, however, this descent between the two homes apparently was responsible for affecting another animal, the Lyons' dog. The animal is a 2-year-old Collie, kept in a pen located between the Lyons' home and the Murnan's eastern- most pasture fence. The author visited the Lyons' home on December 18,1982 and witnessed a large sign at the driveway stating \"Beware of Dog.\" No dog was evident, either physically or vocally, as the author parked and approached the house. Mrs. Lyons remarked during the course of his interview that the dog, which in her words \"barks at everything that moves, all of the time,\" had not barked at all since the night of the llth, a full week earlier. Joe Murnan also commented when asked about any strange animal behavior that it seemed to him the dog had been awfully quiet.lately. When the object reappeared above the hilltop, it began to slowly move west towards Joe's home, and stopped about 75 feet away. Remaining motionless, the object hovered about 10 feet above the ground. After a few seconds, the object rose vertically, and then began to move east again, passing directly over the Lyons' home. Joe, still in telephone contact with Mrs. Lyons, informed her of the object's movements, and so finally, looking out of her east-facing front door, Mrs. Lyons sighted the object and watched as it continued to move east of her house for approximately a quarter of a ' mile, and then turn north. From their respective vantage points, Joe, Tauni, and Mrs. Lyons watched the object as it continued to slowly move north and disappear from sight. After losing sight of the object, Joe telephoned the Otoe County Nebraska Interim Sheriff, Rich Tilson, in Nebraska City. Sheriff Tilson received the call at 11:10 p.m., and responded by driving to the Murnan residence. After questioning the original witnesses, surveying the area,, and observing nothing unusual, Sheriff Tilson then drove to an intersection of county roads about 4 miles north of the Murnan residence. This vantage point is well elevated in relation to the surrounding terrain, affording a view in all directions which is almost totally unobstructed. Sheriff Tilson was joined at this site by his Chief Deputy who had been approaching from the west. After stopping their cars, the Chief Deputy told Tilson that as he was driving to the intersection, he had been observing a small, white light, flashing at regular intervals, which was moving in a circular pattern in the eastern sky. The Sheriff and his Chief Deputy watched as the object ceased its circular movements, and began to move slowly westward, passing directly overhead. Traveling at an estimated altitude of 3,500 feet, the object passed, by in complete silence. Puzzled by the lack of engine noise at such close proximity, the officers began attempts to identify the object as a conventional aircraft. Sheriff Tilson contacted his dispatcher, and he, in turn, was able to . establish contact with radar operators at Omaha's Eppley Airfield, and Offut Air Base, located just north of Omaha in Bellevue, Nebraska. The radar operators stated that they were not tracking anything in the Nebraska City arei. (It was also determined that they had tracked nothing during the time- frame of the Murnan's initial sighting.) The radar operator also stated that due to the excellent weather conditions, the radar visibility was exceptionally good that evening. Tilson and his Chief Deputy continued to watch the flashing light slowly move west toward the city of Syracuse, Nebraska. As the object (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Nebraska, Continued approached Syracuse, Tilson made radio contact with the Chief of Police in that city, who was also observing the light. The Police Chief watched as the light began to move in a large circle around the city. As the light circled, it was also observed by a Johnson County'Deputy Sheriff, located south of ; Syracuse. The first \"change\" occurred at this point. Both the Deputy and the Police Chief reported that the light they, were observing was a helicopter. No other running lights normally associated with a helicopter or a fixed wing aircraft had become visible — only the single, white flashing light was visible. However, the distinctive engine/rotor sound of a helicopter was now heard. Checking again with the radar operators, via his dispatcher, Tilson was told that there were no aircraft in the Syracuse or Nebraska City areas. After circling the Syracuse area, the light then began to move slowly to the,north, toward the town of Weeping , Water, Nebraska, where another law enforcement officer became involved, . and another puzzling change occurred. The Weeping Water officer had overheard the radio transmissions of the other officers, and watched as the light approached his town. After observing the light, he radioed Sheriff Tilson with the information that the object he was observing appeared to be a biplane! Sheriff Tilson questioned the Officer's description with some suspicion, but he maintained that what he saw definitely appeared to him to be a biplane. The \"light-helicopter-biplane\" continued to move to the north, and the Weeping Water officer asked Sheriff Tilson if he would like the police in Louisville, Nebraska, notified in order to continue tracking the object. (Louisville is directly north of Weeping Water.) Sheriff Tilson's comment to the MUFON investigative team regarding this communication was. quite interesting. He stated: \"When the Officer asked if i wanted Louisville to follow it, I thought to myself, 'No, its transformed itself twice, I don't think I want to know anymore about it.\" The 4 Approximate View Showing Steepness of Hill East of Murnan Home Weeping Water .Officer watched as the \"light : helicopter-biplane\" continued on to the north. No further reports of this ; particular object were received, and none have been uncovered in the course of this investigation. Sheriff Tilson and his Chief Deputy continued to scan the skies from their original vantage point, the intersection about 4 miles north of the Murnan's home. At this point (about 12:15 a.m.), Sheriff Tilson was looking into the western sky when suddenly a brilliant, completely silent flash of white light appeared 'about half way up the horizon. The flash originated from a single point in the sky, however, the Sheriff described two diagonal \"arms\" of light which radiated from the point- of-origin, one downward toward the ground, the other upward. Sheriff Tilson, as stated, was looking directly at the point of origin when the flash occurred.      ; It was indicated by the Sheriff that though very brief, the light was of such brightness .and intensity that it cast distinct shadows; indeed, it was bright enough that it was witnessed not only by Tilson and his Chief Deputy (located in Otoe County), but also by law enforcement personnel in Nemaha and Johnson Counties, and by civilian witnesses in Otoe, Cass, and Lancaster Counties. The flash was seen and reported by a total of ten witnesses in five counties—an area approximately 48 miles in diameter. (This distance may be somewhat misleading; it is the greatest distance between two sets of observers, Sheriff Tilson and his Chief Deputy in Otoe County, and a couple in Lincoln,. Nebraska. Due to the brief nature of the flash it is impossible to gain an exact determination of the location of the point of origin. .The probable location, as determined by the available data seems to place the point of origin over, central to west-central Otoe County.) One of the Lancaster County witnesses (who also stated that the flash was intense enough to cast shadows at her point of observation) described the event in somewhat poetic terms: \"It was as if someone were taking a picture of the Earth, and that was their flash bulb going off.\" T ' Having discovered no reports of a straight-line nature such as a meteorite or a fireball would create, and a consistency among the witnesses of a point-source-origin, a meteorite/fireball explanation seems very unlikely. Sheriff Tilson, initially thinking that the flash, though silent, was the result of an aircraft explosion ascertained, again, through the radar operators in Omaha that no aircraft had been or were in the vicinity. Misidentification of either conventional aircraft, or heavenly bodies was also examined, however, the lack of radar tracking of a target, and the apparently controlled movements of the object, and the bizarre transformations witnessed by credible, trained observers seems also to rule out this possibility. Weather conditions were also closely examined, (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Nebraska, Continued but were not determined to be a factor. Clear and cold, with unlimited visibility, the actual statistics, as provided by the National Weather Service were as follows: Temperature — 7° F.; Wind Direction — South-Southwest; Wind Speed — 4 m.p.h.; Relative Humidity - 69%; Barometric Pressure - 30.37 and falling. Prior to this, the National Weather Service had recorded a total of 20 hours of clear skies. In summary, we have, at the present time, no explanation for these events, reported by witnesses who all appear as highly credible, sincere individuals, some of whom, as law enforcement officers, are trained observers. No motivation to prompt a hoax, or maintain one involving such a large group of people spread over such a wide geographic area has been indicated whatsoever. It is the author's considered opinion that all of those involved are telling the truth regarding their experiences. To conclude: we have an initial UFO sighting, involving 3 civilian witnesses, and 2 instances of animal effects. Then, approximately 40 minutes later a second, apparently unrelated UFO sighting, involving five law enforcement officers. During the course of this sighting, the object apparently exhibited itself in 3 different forms: (1) a silent, flashing white light; (2) a flashing white light accompanied by the engine/rotor sounds of a helicopter; and (3) the configuration of a biplane, accompanied by an engine sound. Finally, and again apparently unrelated, the intense, silent flash of white light observed over five counties. It is the opinion of this researcher, that until such time as further evidence to support a conventional explanation can be brought forward, it is safe to relegate all three incidents to the category of unknowns.

At all times when giving talks in this part of Africa, I have tried to persuade as many of the local people'as possible'to attend, but it has not always been easy for them to assimilate the basic principles of UFQs, due to language and ethnic difficulties. This particular sighting took place . on the.evening of August 15, 1981, at LaRochelle, a large estate 9 km outside Mutare, a small town near the border of Mocambique and Zimbabwe. La Rochelle was originally owned by Sir Stephen and Lady Virginia Courtauld. The Courtaulds were extremely wealthy and generous people and gave much to the nation. When they left the country for good in 1972, they donated La Rochelle to the people of Zimbabwe. It is situated in the beautiful Imbeza Valley and is not part of the Nyabara Forest Training School, and its gardens and buildings have been a tourist attraction for both locals and visitors from abroad. As one approaches the estate, wide sweeping lawns slope up to the homestead and buildings at the back which comprise an observation tower, the main living quarters and towards the back, a futuristic type of building which is known as \"the Fantasy\" and was used as a retreat and orchid-house by Lady Courtauld. On the right-hand side facing the buildings is a long narrow building which is the tea-room and behind this, the quarters for the laborers. The place is kept in meticulous condition by the Forestry Commission who employ about 30 laborers and 3 Observation Tower at La Rochelle Game Park Wardens to supervise and run the place. I first heard of the sighting through one of the Wardens, Andrew Connolley, who wrote to me after reading my book and explained that something had happened there in August 1981 which had them all puzzled. He wondered if I would be coming that way so that I could investigate what had happened. I replied immediately and arrived there in November 1982. ' One of the first people I met was Clifford Muchena, the main witness to the event. Clifford is 1.65 meters tall, slightly built and pleasant faced. He is not highly educated but he can read and speaks a reasonable English. He said, \"It was around half-past six when I saw a ball of light near the tearoom from my house nearby. Then everyone started seeing it. It was very big and it rolled towards the tearoom. Other people who saw it saw it first in the observation-tower rolling around inside the room, and they thought the tower was on fire as there were flames coming out of the window. \"They were very frightened. Then I ran to ring the emergency bell which is at the side of the house and some more men came running out. Then the ball went in front of the main building and past me onto the Fantasy building. I stopped ringing the bell and ran to the Fantasy building to see what was happening and I could see that it was all alight and filled with flames. Then I saw three men standing there — it might have been four men, but I think it was three. I was very afraid and I wondered what kind of a fire this was. \"At first I thought one of the men was Mr. Connolley and that he had come because of the fire. So I tried to greet him by calling his name. The men were tall, more than 1.8 meters and when I called Mr. Connolley's name they turned around, very slowly, and I was very frightened. They were wearing shiny whitish overalls; the color was like this\"... (he produced a silver 20-cent piece from his pocket) ...\"and there were three of them. Maybe four. When they were standing there, they had their (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Entities, Continued backs to me but when I called Mr. Connolley's name, they turned around. \"I couldn't see their faces because it was shining so much light that I had to put my hands up to protect my eyes. I couldn't see if they were wearing anything on their heads. I didn't look very closely because of the light; it blinded me. \"And then, when I put my hands up to cover my eyes, I fell down. All the time I was very frightened.\" I asked Clifford why he had fallen down. He couldn't have been pushed as he indicated to me where he was standing and where the men were and it was about 3 meters away. \"There was a power from them, too much light shining in my eyes, so I fell down.\" I asked Clifford if he had trouble with his eyes subsequently, but he said \"no.\" Also, who did he think the men were? \"I thought at first it was Mr. Connolley and some friends of his but then I could see that they had such strange clothes on so I knew it wasn't Mr. Connolley. I thought they must be Mr. Connolley's friends but there was no car in the car park. They must have come by car, but where was the car?\" He went on, \"The shape of their clothes was like overalls, all one color. I didn't see anything more because they turned to me almost immediately as. I called and it was such a shock to my eyes:\" I asked if he had ever read anything about Outer Space, about the possibility of people and craft coming from out there? He was obviously puzzled. \"I don't know. Do you mean astronauts? I read about astronauts in a book.\" . Did he see a picture of the astronauts in the book he read? Did they look like these men? \" I don't know,\" Clifford replied, \"there were no pictures. Just the story.\" He hesitated. \"Some of the 20 or more people who saw this thing, they think that it was ghosts. I think it might have been the spirits of my ancestors.\" I put it to Clifford that his ancestors, with all due respect, would surely have worn hide clothes, and not Clifford Muchena, Head Gardener Alarm Bell at La Rochelle silvery overalls. Was it not true that they would wear fur around their heads and necklaces of lion or crocodile teeth? \"Yes,\" he said, \"but you know, times change!\" While I had been talking to Clifford, one of the gardeners had gone to fetch another witness, Eunice Kachiti, who was a domestic worker at the Forestry Commission house in the grounds. In fact, I learned later that Eunice was also in charge of the home- crafts workshop for the women of the estate and before I left, they asked me to view their needlework, crocheting and knitting. Eunice said, \"It was a Saturday and I was at my house when I saw some fire at that tree\" ...(she indicated a Cassia tree, now bare of foilage, in the center of the lawn) ... \"There were two men standing there; two strange men. They had torches (flashlights) in their hands. The light that was shining was like the light from a torch. They had on blue jeans but I couldn't see the top half of their bodies as the torch was only shining on their legs. I thought they were standing and looking at the ball in (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Entities, Continued . front of thein.\" I asked Eunice to describe the torches, or what she could see of them as best she could. She told me they appeared to be longer than the normal torch used in that area with an elongated end where the light was coming from. \"The ball of light started to move towards the tearoom. The color of the ball changed from yellow to bright red and as it moved it became bigger and bigger until it was about \\ l / 2 meters wide. \"It started from the Cassia tree over there, then it stood for about 2-3 minutes and then it came back to the tree. All the time, the men were still there, they never moved. At the time I thought the men were just ordinary visitors watching the fire. Then the ball went back to the tearoom again and later to the wall of the observation tower. It walked up the wall of the tower and into the room at the top.\" As far as we know, and based on the memories of the people involved, there were no visitors to La Rochelle that afternon. The entrance fee is 50 cents and receipted in a book, but the total number of visitors is recorded on a weekly basis, not a daily basis. However, the weather was very poor, overcast and drizzling most of the time, and none of the workers could recall any visitors being there. However, this is open to doubt as their memories could not be expected to go back that far. I asked Eunice if it seemed to her that the men had anything to do with the ball of fire, or were they just observing it. \"I don't know,\" she admitted. \"I think they were just looking at it because it jumped in the air and began bouncing higher and higher. Then it bounced to the tower and crept up the wall and I saw it walking around the tower inside. It looked like the tower was burning. When I looked back to where the men were, they had disappeared. Then the fire went away.\" Soon after Clifford had rung the emergency bell, Eunice told me that one of the Game Park Wardens, Mr. Gardener, arrived on the scene. She 8 Eunice Katete, Who Also Saw Entities said, \"I asked Mr. Gardener what it was and even he did not know. The people here say it was ghosts because they have seen this thing before.\" The next person I spoke to was Naison Sampindi, who was formerly head gardener to the Courtaulds and is now garden-foreman. He said, \"It was after six o'clock and I was coming from the Apostolic Church where I had been. I saw the fire coming up to the tower and burning through the top window. The light was so bright that it lit up the whole house and all the garden. I saw the fire going right down the tower wall and then walking, in a ball, round to where the emergency bell was. I went to my house and then I heard the bell ringing. I wondered who was ringing the bell as it was too dark to see. It was Clifford ringing the bell to call the European (white) men to come because of the fire. Then Clifford came to my house and told me that he had been ringing the bell because he saw this big fire at the Fantasy and the people standing there.\" What did you think it was, I asked Naison. He laughed hilariously. \"I thought it was a ghost,\" he said. \"First of all I thought it was a fire but when Clifford talked to me, then I thought, that must be a ghost.\" Gardener, who was the first on the\" scene in response to the ringing of the emergency bell, could find no evidence of the fire. There was no smell, no smoke, no signs of physical burning. He tried to calm the excited crowd, as most of the women had run off into the bush with their children, too terrified to wait and see what it was all about. However, he dismissed it all airily. \"They were all drunk,\" he said. Apparently, Saturday night was beer- drink night, and Clifford was noted for being \"one of the boys.\" However, neither Eunice nor Naison were drinkers and Gardener admitted this. Also, one should take into account that they drink every Saturday night, so why did the fire and the strange men not occur on any other Saturday night? On the Monday, when Connolley came on duty, he was told about the incident and checked the grounds thoroughly with some of the witnesses. He said, \"I looked inside the observation tower and the Fantasy. There was no sign of footprints or any burn marks.\" However, he did tell me that there was some methane gas down in the valley. The Fantasy stands high up and looks down into a steep valley at the bottom of which is a small dam with quite a bit of rotting vegetation, an ideal situation for the production of methane gas. I subsequently spoke to Professor Geoffrey Bond of the University of Zimbabwe about methane gas and its (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Entities, Continued behaviour. Methane is a colorless, odorless gas (CH 4 ). Prof. Bond informed me that it was produced from swampy ground where there was rotting vegetation. The methane collects into a large ball below the vegetation and then bursts forth, burns readily in contact with the air, and explodes. When burning it forms into carbon dioxide and water vapor which of course, has no smell. Prof. Bond said that normally the gas did not leave its own environment, or so it was thought, but during the establishment of Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, there were many reports of balls of fire high above the rotting vegetation, and during the War of Liberation, was often mistaken for flares by the troops. Bond did agree that despite this, he thought the movement of the described ball of light was rather unusual and not quite in line with the normal movement of methane gas. Thomas Kachiti, Eunice's husband, recalled that on August 7, 1981, they were coming over the rise behind La Rochelle when they also saw a light in the tower which vanished after a few seconds. One of the senior African staff thought that the place was haunted by the • ghosts of the Courtaulds coming back to their home, a theory prescribed to in African lore. I thought perhaps that Ball Lightning might have been involved, but the sky was heavily overcast, there was constant drizzle and no sign of thunder or lightning in the area. A further hypothesis was put forward by a friend of mine. He thought that perhaps some \"illegal\" visitors had arrived, had entered without paying (the entry gate is closed at 5 p.m. but the grounds are easily accessible) and were viewing La Rochelle with their torch. This would account for the \"blue jeans\" that Eunice thought, the men were wearing and the torches she saw. On Tuesday, March 29, 1983, I drove down to Mutare and La Rochelle to test his theory and take some more photographs of the area. With the assistance of Andrew Connolley, my friend Helene, Clifford and Naison, we agreed to meet at La Rochelle at 7 p.m. It was dark but the moon was quite 'The Fantasy\" Building bright. Connolley had arrived with a very powerful torch and we started the experiment. Helene walked with the torch in her hand across the ground and there was no doubt that it \"bounced.\" But, said Clifford, it wasn't the right color. The ball they had seen was far brighter and far larger. Naison agreed with this. When we reached the tower, Clifford again said that the light of the torch \"climbing\" the tower was similar to what they had seen, but not bright enough. However, when the torch light was shone on the observation area windows, both men immediately pointed out that this was not the way it had been at all. When the torch shone on the windows, the inside of the observation room was quite black; whereas on the night, the observation tower had appeared to be on fire, so bright was the light from inside. We shone the torch directly into Clifford's face. He admitted that it was bright, but again, nothing like the light and power he had experienced on August 15, 1981. Also, he said, after he had fallen down, the men disappeared. Could they have run away? Helene ran across the grass, across the concrete, and finally along the gravel driveway. Each time, light as she is, we could hear her footsteps. Clifford heard nothing! Again, if it had been ordinary torches, it could not account for the brilliant lighting up of the grounds, which are large. Also, our activities, although unknown to the rest of the laborers and their families, elicited no curious calling out or cries from their quarters. There are several points to bear in mind on this case. Firstly, the people readily accepted the events as \"natural\" to them. They were either ancestors making an appearance, or they were ghosts. In African tribal belief, there are certain ceremonies which should be carried out upon death. A feast should be prepared by the immediate famijy and contributed to by other members of the tribe: the feast is attended initially by the Chief and the Elders who are later joined by the rest of the tribespeople. If this is not done, the spirit is restless and will appear to remind his family of their obligations. When a person dies, the head must be turned in the direction of his home, so that he will easily know the way, for that is where he will want to spend his spirit days. If the person is away from home, in a strange land, and this ritual is not observed, again the spirit will remain restless and haunt his relatives until some retribution is made. Therefore, the actual act of haunting or ghosts is not unacceptable to the people as a whole. Nocturnal lights are also part of African lore. This is usually the ghost of a person whose spirit was trapped in the body by a sorcerer or witch before it"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MULTIPLE ABDUCTIONS IN CANADA: PART I ,  . By Lawrence J. Fcnwick • ,  (Co-Director, Canadian UFO Research Network) ,.'-..:  • (Note: This report was originally published in CUFORN Bulletin;] Oct.- Noy., 1982.) :' ' / The Canadian UFO Research Network (CUFORN) has investigated a series of incidents that it feels is proof that some people are abducted more than once. ,,    , ,'• : A man whom we shall call Jack T. was 27 years old in 1982 and, as of this writing, worked as a supervisor and technician in an electronics warehouse. In his spare time, he plays a recorder in a local rock band in his home town of St. 'Catherines, Ontario, Canada. He bought Budd Hopkins' book Missing Time in the spring of 1982. After reading it, he felt that there were some periods of time he could not remember in his past. He wrote to Hopkins in New York City, and later had three regressive hypnosis sessions under the' direction of Dr. Aphrodite Clamar at her New York office. He felt that he had gained some knowledge' from the. sessions after, he heard the tapes played back to him in New York. When Jack got home, he heard that the MUFON UFO Symposium would be held in Toronto on the first weekend of July. There, he spoke to CURORN's Eric Smith. Eric telephoned Joe Muskat, CUFORN's President and Entities, Continued  , could pass on, and is used by that person for its evil ambitions. . In Zimbabwe, there is the story of Maganga who was coming home one night when he saw a very bright light in front of him. He took fright and turned back, running down the path, but to his amazement, the light again appeared in front of him. No matter which way he ran, the light was always before him and growing closer. Suddenly, it went out and invisible hands caught him roughly around the throat and then manhandled him violently. He fell to the . ground and eventually summoned up enough strength to crawl back to his kraal where he lay, partially paralyzed and without speech. Only when his relatives called in a special ghost-laying nganga (witchdoctor) who gave him herbal medicine which made him vomit green froth, was he able to return to normal and regain his speech. The teller of this story was a District Commissioner in Rhodesia at the time and he says when he saw Maganga before he was cured he was convinced the man was dying. When he saw him again after his treatment, he was in excellent health 1 . There are many similar stories 10 recorded in the annals of Rhodesian history; many involving dogs, who also were either cured by the nganga or died as a result of their encounter. The other point I want to make is that these people had no idea of UFOs or craft from other worlds or dimensions, and had no idea what I was talking about, so one can hardly blame their imagination for running riot. And if there was any mass hallucination, it would scarcely take the form of men in silvery overalls! Of course, there are many questions left to tantalize one, and if readers have any suggestions as to what further investigations could be undertaken, I would very much like to hear from them 2 . On an overall basis, if this is a genuine confrontation, it does appear to me that it is an important piece of evidence in favor of the existence of men from Other Worlds, or Other Dimensions.

Cynthia Hind, P.O. Box 768, Harare, Zimbabwe. Co-Director. Joe spoke to Jack and found that he had proved normal after, psychological tests in New York prior to the hypnosis there.'CUFORN's ; Co- Directors interviewed Jack for seven hours at Treasurer Harry Tokarz's Toronto apartment on July 17, 1982. Jack seemed intelligent, stable, subdued, honest, arid:a bit nervous at meeting hew people. He talked softly and looked naturally worried yet curious about the reasons for his encounters. Jack is recently separated from his wife. He is an only child. He is left-handed. (Are all or most abductees left-handed?) 1 He wanted no publicity and only agreed to relate his incidents if his name was not used. In the course of the investigation, we found out that the series of events began when Jack was two years old in 1957: The others happened in 1959, 1961, in 1964 or 1965, in 1969, on October 16, 1971, and in 1976. Four occurred in the St. Catharines area. The 1957 and 1959 events were in the Owen Sound district near Georgian Bay in Central Ontario. The 1961 event location is unknown. On July 20, Harry Tokarz phoned Dr. Susan Schulman, a competent M.D. and behavioral' .therapist in Toronto, whose practice is restricted to hypnotherapy. She reconditioned Jack in the first session on July 24. Afterward, she said he was an excellent subject. The August 7 session brought out the first event which occurred in the summer of 1957. Jack's mother let him do small errands for her on his stroller, which was the kind that lets a child walk by himself or herself. He walked one day to a small store nearby to buy milk. On the way, he met a small, silver- suited humanoid and saw a silver saucer-shaped object close at hand. Sitting'on a mound, it looked like two discs, one inverted on the other! The (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Canada, Continued humanoid told him it was a \"space ship.\" Jack described the creature: \"Its hands were silver-grayish. It had funny- looking fingers and big black eyes.\" Jack had apparently caught jt and another creature off guard and working around the object. He asked them what they were doing. One humanoid asked Jack where he came from. The humanoid took Jack inside the craft. There was a film being run on a wall screen which the humanoids were watching. One humanoid picked Jack up and 'placed him on a table. He saw different colored lights on the craft's walls, a round shelf in the middle of the floor, and an exit in front. The screen was to his right. Something was put on his wrist. They examined his mind with another device by siphoning information from his brain using a computer which had wires attached to it and to his head. The humanoid told him it was a test. ., Jack saw another screen which the creatures watched while they tested him. He saw unintelligible figures like numbers on the screen. They said the machines were used to examine him to see if he met the criteria for something. They moved the wrist and head bands. Jack felt very tired. The creatures took him off the table and down some steps out of the craft. They put him back on his stroller; and one creature walked with him to a point near his house. The humanoid told Jack: \"I have to go.\" The humanoid's feet were' pointed straight and moved simultaneously. It glided up the craft's steps and entered it. Jack now recalled an incident that took place about two years later. He was in his Owen, Sound home playing with toy blocks 1 . Something shot out from behind the couch and drew blood painlessly from his ankle in less than a minute. The device swiftly released his ankle and moved behind the couch. He told his mother he had hurt himself. She bandaged the ankle which healed soon afterwards. -   , Jack and his father Bill underwent' a double hypnosis session on September 18. Bill had told Harry Tokarz and Joe Muskat on August 1 of an incident which happened when he was driving near his home with young Jack in 1961. He remembered getting out of the car and being confronted by four-foot-tall humanoids who were standing in front of a landed craft. He shielded his son with his body and told him to get back into the car, saying to him \"I know how to deal with them.\" Then he recalled driving and a vague memory of being stopped again. The September 18 hypnosis allowed Bill to relive the incident. These facts confirmed what Jack said under hypnosis previously regarding this • incident. However, Bill came up against a \"block\" when the humanoids brought him to a \"black, shiny mirror-like entrance to the UFO.\" At this point; he started crying. He claimed he did this because he was rejected by the humanoids for a \"mission\" that had already been programmed into him. Since then, Bill has had vivid dreams of seeing a \"museum of time,\" a place or a chamber where the humanoids apparently took him and where he saw a whole 1 range of antiquated and modern technological devices, all man-made. These included electronic sending and. receiving equipment, computers, gauges, and tape machines. The devices dated from the early 1900's through the present and there were some which looked like they may be from our future 2 . The Black Cadillac At Twelve Mile Creek .'j- | j July 24 and 31, 1982 hypnotic trances brought forth the Twelve Mile Creek incident which occurred in the summer of 1964 or 1965, when Jack was 9 to 10 years old, near St. Catharines. He and Jim Voss were playing in a deserted, hilly conservation area 10 miles south of Lake Ontario. Jim spotted a humanoid and called out to Jack who also observed it. The creature approached and mentally asked them to follow him to 'see something interesting. They were told that they would not be harmed. . Jack described the humanoid as about 4 feet tall, bald, with cream- colored skin. A slit-like mouth did not open. The nose was small. There was a small, hook-shaped opening where the Jack T. Dr. Susan Schulman ears would have been. The creature's facial expressions were human-like. The head was very large in proportion to the body. The large eyes had a hypnotic quality to them and were slanted around to the sides of the head. The hands had four fingers, two of which were long with very wide ends. They wore shiny, dark blue, skin-tight uniforms and boots. The pant legs seemed to be inserted into the boots. There was a black belt. The uniform covered everything except the hands and face. It had a long collar open (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Canada, Continued slightly at the chest and had no buttons or seams. A black insignia on the right shoulder and one just below the left lapel appeared stencilled on (See drawing). The boys followed the humanoid to a nearby garage. There they were maneuvered into a \"used, four-door, black Cadillac automobile, which seemed to be air-conditioned, with one- way glass in the windows. The interior was plush.\" They sat in the back and saw no humnoids in the front. The car was driven down the dirt road to a swampy area near the Sea Cadets building. They emerged from the car and were shown a large, metallic, disc- shaped object on the ground. They were taken inside the dimly-lit craft and placed on cots which had wheels on them. Jack saw computer consoles along one wall and couches in the room. They were made to drink a liquid which made them drowsy 3 . Instruments probed their bodies. Jack saw a screen on the wall. After a few seconds, a dark spot appeared on the screen. The instrument probes were removed. The boys were released and told that they should forget everything because people would not believe them if they told their story. The boys were put back into the car and driven back to the garage area. Jack remembered that, inside the craft, there had been two other humanoids who were shorter than the first one. Their uniforms were a light silvery blue with black belts. The shorter creatures were \"like workers,\" said Jack. He recalled seeing the creatures walking away from the garage. The various hypnosis sessions helped trigger memories of a few other incidents. Jack was able to consciously recall an encounter which took place when he was 14 in 1969. He was with his friend Ken Johnson (a pseudonym) in another St. Catharines conservation area, Short Hills. He and Ken were picked up by a large Bigfoot-type creature and taken on board a landed object. There, a Type I humanoid told them that they use the Bigfoot creature to do their heavy lifting on Earth. 12 The boys had seen the Bigfoot sit down on a large chair in the UFO. The humanoids placed wires on its head which led to another device nearby. It seemed to Jack that the creatures were programming the Bifgoot to do some other task. Jack remembered seeing Ken on an operating table with blood issuing from his left ear and temple, while surrounded by humanoids dressed like doctors; Jack felt certain that some sort of implant was put into Ken's head. Jack felt that he too may have had an implant given him. Infrared photography done by Joe Muskat was of no use because the film was past its expiration date. This was not noticed until it was too late to take more photos. We urged Jack to have x-rays taken, but he is rather lazy and has not bothered to get it done. We will try in the near future to repeat the infrared photography. Jack arrived at Dr. Schulman's office for hypnosis on August 21. A series of seemingly unrelated problems began that day and ended on September 18. Jack's grandmother died on August 21. Jack's father was attacked by a \"metaphysical entity\" clothed in black. The attack left a black mark on Bill's chest. During the hypnosis, Jack described the exact location of the party his band played at on the night of the Van incident, which is described later in this article. The doctor noticed some wavering and insecurity in Jack and gave him a \"shot of confidence.\" Jack was very frustrated about his inability to prove the incident was true. Jack also had some problems with his boss, something that had never happened before. Larry Fenwick got two odd phone calls at his office. One sounded like a series of tape recordings being played simultaneously; the other was the sound of a screaming woman. Both calls came within one hour of each other on the same day. He also found out that his wife had cancer and pleurisy. As of September 18, she had recovered from the pleurisy and by March 1983, chemotherapy and radiation had eliminated the cancer. Harry and Sandy, his girl friend, had a very unusual set of problems with a marketing company which led to litigation. Sandy had medical problems and was hospitalized briefly. Harry's motion picture and television casting business was near bankruptcy when one of his major clients, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, dropped him. His business declined by about 40 percent. This has since been resolved. Joe had personal difficulties with a female co-worker. Joe's wife threatened to leave him. Dr. Schulman had a \"horrendous argument\" on a Las Vegas vacation with her boy friend and lost an unusually large amount of money gambling. CUFORN contacted Jack's father who agreed to hypnosis after much prodding. On the day before the session scheduled for September 11, which would also see Jack hypnotized, Harry got an anxious phone call from Jack, saying that he got a telephone call at work from a \"friend\" of Dr. Schulman — not the doctor's secretary. The caller said that the appointment was cancelled, and dodged all questions as to why, not even suggesting another appointment. Four previous attempts by Joe to reach the doctor were unsuccessful. By the time Jack called Harry, it was clear that Dr. Schulman was avoiding contact with CUFORN. She was absent from her office and home for three weeks. Joe and Harry went to her office on September 11 to see if they could find her. There was no sign of her. They left a note asking her to call them as soon as possible. When Harry got home at 9:30 p.m., he opened the door to find Sandy holding the telephone receiver with a puzzled look on her face. She told him a rather unusual call had just ended as Harry walked into the apartment. A deep male voice had asked: \"Is the male of the house in? This is official business. Tell him and them to stop what they are doing or else. You will not be—\" Then the phone call was cut off. There were numbers being recited in the background during the call. Curiously, after we finally contacted the doctor two days later, she claimed she never got our note, and seemed disinterested. A session was rebooked for Jack and Bill through our (coninued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"BRIGHT PLANETS IN 1983 (Constellation locations at mid-month and evening/morning visibility.

(It is odd that the doctor was the one who had originally urged us to set up the appointment.) Jack and five or six other persons were returning from a party at Jenny Miller's (pseudonym) house in Vineland Station on October 16, 1971 at 1:30 p.m. Most of them were members of a rock band which had been hired to play there. The band was returning to St. Catharines. Tom Irving (a pseudonym), the guitarist there, arrived on September 22,1982 for an appointment, along with his wife Ann Marie (a pseudonym). While he was in a preconditioning session with his wife present, she went into a light trance state and said that she recalled the party. On September 29, Tom resisted Dr. Shulman's probing. He stated: \"There is something there in the back of my mind. . .all the time. . . like a resistance.\" He also \"vaguely\" recalled \"going off the road.. .maybe because of an accident.\" He did not recall the party. Dr. Schulman told us that Tom had a mental block both consciously and unconsciously. We phoned Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, veteran UFOlogist, psychologist and Director of the Division of Counseling and Testing at the University of Wyoming. He advised us on how to continue the exploration of the case and said that the problems we had personally were all part of it .He said later that \"if you acknowledge it, it tends to taper off.\" Dr. Schulman had a long conversation with Dr. Sprinkle which she said was helpful. Joe and Harry visited Tom and Ann Marie on October 8. She led them straight to a house in Vineland Station where the party was held. According to the records of Tom's engagements, the party did occur at that house on October 16, 1971. Only she and Jack recalled the incident. Sam J. (a pseudonym), the drummer, and Calvin Stoddard (a pseudonym), the bass player, offered no help. (To be continued.)

It may . never be adequately understood or described. It concerns, the controversial case of Rev.. Harrison E. Bailey's \"entity\" photos. The first public report about this, series of Polaroid photos appeared in 1981 in this Journal. In a two-part • column, 1 Bailey's description of how he' photographed two early morning \"unknown visitors\" was condensed into about 4,000 words. According to his . own statements, the two \"entities\" apparently materialized and demater-' ialized within the rooms of his small Pasadena, Calif, studio apartment. The Journal made a brave attempt to reproduce two of the photos, chosen from a series of ten. A black/white reproduction of a full-light photo showing two masks with white appendages reproduced well enough to show the readers the bizarre nature of the case,, but the reproduction of the , second \"entity,\" purportedly showing a silhouetted humanoid shape with thin ' body and large head leaping through an open doorway and backlit by a strong, unidentified light source, was hopelessly dim and obscure. In actual fact, this second photo, which Journal readers could not have a fair chance to judge, is probably the best of the lot. Although shadowed and not in full color, this photo is rather startling. When seen at its best — either in good photo copies or when projected in slide form onto' a screen - it shows a strange \"shredding\" effect of the humanoid form's right arm and torso, which fits in with the witness' statement that the creature(s) \"dematerialized.\" Equally strange is another photo of the series, which purportedly shows two brownish heads with distorted features postioned against a window shade. This photo, also, is not in full color, but deeply shadowed, and is seen 14 at its best only when projected onto a screen in slide form or, better still, scanned under a microviewer. The main purpose of this column is to answer, at least partially, our Journal Editor . Dick Hall's \"Editorial Comments\" which he entitled \"A skeptical view of the Bailey case.\" These comments appeared immedi- ately following Part I of the column on pp. 11-12 (No. 155, Jan. 1981). My longtime friend and colleague, • Dick Hall, is a serious, veteran researcher, and I value his judgments. I wish, however, to center on ten points of his \"Skeptical View,\" and to answer them one by one, drawing on my detailed knowledge of Rev. Bailey and his UFO involvement. I have wished to answer these comments for two full years, but because of the extreme complexity of the case, could not quite figure out how to do it succinctly. His view of Bailey as a man who craves attention and who has somehow concocted the photos as a means of gaining attention has become rather widespread. During a meeting in Los Angeles recently — a planning session for the forthcoming 1983 MUFON Symposium in Pasadena — I found myself listening to a researcher who ordinarily could accept even bizarre cases as potentially real, but he was expressing his offhand impression that the Bailey photos were a bid for attention by the witness. This researcher did not know much about the case; he was merely repeating Richard Hall's \"Comments.\" I realized then I could not put off any longer an extended explanation of the facts as I know them, even though full explanation may take several column spaces. The specific points which Dick Hall mentions are: 1. Bailey's long record of activities and claims regarding UFOs. 2. The nature of the hypnotic regression which led to his \"abduction\" story, concerning a close encounter with a landed craft with two occupants which he reported as occurring Sept. 24, 1951. . 3. Bailey's statement that in 1975 he had a run-in with Nazis, after which he was found suspended from a tree in a Pasadena Park. 4. His various statements about his medical history, alleging several specific illnesses and medical anomalies supposedly resulting from alien contact. 5. Bailey's statement that the entire series of 1978 photos were taken without flash equipment, even though the four fulllight photos showing the masks and appendages revealed typical reflective patterns of shiny surfaces. 6. A \"rambling\" statement, supposedly dictated by the visiting \"entities,\" which contains spiritually- oriented messages for earth. 7. The fact that Bailey's medical records from the Northwestern University Medical Center (dated Nov. 18, 1966) indicated that he had \"mild cerebral damage\". 8. Specifics of an hypnosis session transcript revealing some apparent confusion on Bailey's part regarding time of day. 9. Hall's hypothesis that Bailey, rather than being an actual encounteree or consciously dishonest is, instead, to quote Hall's words, \"A mildly brain-damaged, mentally confused person who needs and wants caring attention,\" and who has presented dubious photographs... \"as less-than-conscious attention-seeking devices to maintain contact with a caring and supportive investigator\" in order to \"feel some sense of individual (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued importance.\" 10. That Bailey was a \"self-styled minister.\" Obviously, these ten points in Hall's \"Comments\" cannot be answered quickly and briefly. Point #2 was answered, with the help of R. Leo Sprinkle, PhD, in the \"California Report\" column in the Journal's Nov. 1981 issue. Since then, nothing further has appeared about the case in these pages. It would take a book-length manuscript to adequately cover this case. I have what I think are adequate facts to respond to each of Hall's other nine points. The main concern of this present column is to answer his #9 and #10 points, which reflect badly on Rev. Bailey's personality and character. For the purpose of demonstrating that Bailey is an independent, emotionally intact, and productive member, of the Pasadena community, and to answer seven 2 of the other eight points above, I collected numerous articles and other documentation and sent them all with an accompanying seven-page letter to Dick and to'several other researchers who were vitally concerned — pro and con — with the case. The letter, per se, cannot be included in toto here, as it was accompanied by copies of the articles and documents, which were listed alphabetically in the text from A to Z. (This in itself points up the extreme complexity of this case.) I will attempt, however, to condense those parts of the letter and documents which refer to Points #9 and #10. . . Rev. Bailey is an associate minister of a mission Baptist Church, in Pasadena. 1 have interviewed several members of the Black community which he serves, and they all unequivocally describe him as a caring, productive, and sensible member of society. These individuals included members of his own church, members of my own (Catholic) parish, and professional persons involved in socioeconomic betterment of underprivileged members of the community, Rev. Bailey is well-known and liked, regarded as an excellent preacher and religious leader. In addition, he is an untiring activist with deep concern for unemployed or otherwise deprived members of the large Black community in Pasadena. During my 25 years of active investigation of Southern California UFO reports, I have come, across numerous cases of claims of ET contact by unstable persons. I can recognize these types of persons for what they are. They include the (1) deluded; (2) unconscious embellishers; and (3) clinging, dependent persons who constantly seek attention; as well as (4) jokers and hoaxers. I try to help all who contact me, but take care not to enter into long-term investigative relationships with the first three types (the fourth type takes care of itself), since the demands of the deluded, the unconscious embellishers, and the attention-seekers can drain an investigator of physical, mental, and emotional energy and because truth cannot be separated from untruth in their statements. I reserve my limited investigative time for balanced, honest individuals, whether their statements regarding UFO encounters are bizarre or not: The entire subject of UFOs is bizarre, if one stands back and looks at it objectively, and relative degrees of bizarreness do not enter into my decision to handle a case on a long-term basis, provided the individual(s) concerned seem honest, productive, rational, and relatively undemanding. Rev., Bailey definitely fits into the \"acceptable witness\" category. He does not drain energy from an investigator. In addition to his excellent standing in his community, he has a keenly-honed, though subtle, sense of humor. This, as any psychiatrist known, is. one sign of a balanced and stable individual. I have never seen him angry, uncharitable, or objectionable in any behaviour pattern, he exhibits normal stress during difficult financial and physical periods, but, in my experience, he has never attempted to load responsibility or guilt onto others. He takes care of his own problems as best he can, in a mature, effective way. Since Dick Hall categorized Rev. Bailey as a \"self-styled minister,\" Bailey provided me with copies of his preliminary preaching license, granted on September 22,1968 by the pastor of his church (Document L). He also provided his full Certificate of Ordination (Document M),granted on December 13, 1970, which was signed by a four-city Commission (seven member) of the Baptist Church in the Los Angeles area. In December 1970 he was assigned the post of associate minister of his present church 3 , performing regular duties of preaching and other ministerial work. 4 . Rev. Bailey has also been totally involved with the Pasadena Foothill Branch/Greater Los Angeles Urban League. Document N, sent to Hall and others, was a personal letter of commendation for his \"dedicated and persevering work\" on behalf of the citizens of Pasadena, and signed by John W. Reagan, ExecutiveDirector. 5 Document O was an article written in 'the STEEL LABOR publication, following a tour Bailey took from Pasadena to Washington, D.C., in an effort to help stop organized crime and poverty. This article referred to Bailey's earlier life as a Gary, Indiana, steel worker, but concentrated on his . implementation of the idea of the \"Junior Store\" in Pasadena. The Junior Store was described in STEEL LABOR as \"a model of what can be done in the face of discouraging prognosis and cynical statistics 6 .\" It described Bailey as \"something special,\" \"a little man., changing things in a big way\", and as a \"champion... who answers arguments from pessimists with a smile of faith and with an around-the-clock schedule that leaves no time for futile debate.\" Bailey has been deeply dedicated to community development with the Pasadena Commission on Human . Needs and Opportunity (PCHNO) for the past 17 years. The Junior Store was founded in Pasadena by PCHO, acting directly on Rev. Bailey's ideas. Document I was composed of selected pages from an 80 page \"Program Evaluation Report\" and names Bailey as being involved in several aspects of the Commission's work. On pp. 68 and 69, the Junior Store is discussed at length 7 . Hall and the other researchers (confinued on nexf page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued . were also sent, as Documents Q, R, S, and T, an official certificate of appreciation to Rev. Bailey from PCHNO 8 , a letter of appreciation and a monetary contribution to the Pasadena Junior Store from a Gary, Indiana, lawyer, Hilbert L. Bradley, who had evidently read the STEEL LABOR article 9 , a letter from the Director of Public Relations of the United Steelworkers of America 10 , and a letter from the Executive Director of the Community Development Agency of the City of Pasadena, commenting on the \"excellent community service\" provided by the Junior store 11 . Another exceptionally telling document (Document V) was a memo from PCHNO's director, appointing Bailey to a sixth term on the commission. This was an unprecedent- ed action, since it is PCHNO's policy to \"retire\" members after a maximum of five terms (10 years). In the memo, the Director states he will take any \"flak\" resulting from this action, and the memo praises Rev. Bailey highly 12 . I could go on for several more pages, outlining Rev. Bailey's effective involvement in Pasadena community affairs, but the above should suffice for the present. The documentation described above, and referenced at the end of this article, is but a portion of similar documentation available. It should convince any open-minded person that Rev. Bailey has been, and remains, a productive, respected individual in the Pasadena community. The only aspect of his work that is not totally accepted by some of his colleagues and friends are his UFO claims. However, the persons I talked with respect him in spite of his UFO activity. He has received so much acclaim and attention for his community service that, if he were an \"attention-seeking individual,\" as Dick Hall and others assume, he would logically concentrate on socio- economic activities, where he receives acclaim. Instead, he continues to make public statements and accepts publicity regarding his ideas on UFO research, for these have been an integral part of his life since his reported intitial CE III 16 on September 24, 1951 outside Orland Park, 111. He has received no acclaim, respect, or attention from these efforts. His UFO activities are tolerated by his colleagues and friends because they respect him for his many other contributions to the Pasadena community. As explained by Rev. Bailey, the Black populace of our country, as a general rule, avoid any involvement with or interest in UFO phenomena. To paraphrase his words, at the present time, Blacks have a hard enough time being accepted as individuals — they do not want to jeopardize their position by reporting UFOs. Rev. Bailey's consistent efforts to inform members of the Black community about UFOs continues, for he is a persevering man. He hopes someday that Blacks will accept the idea of UFOs as has the White population. It is hoped that this initial character and personality profile of Rev. Harrison E. Bailey will provide for Journal readers information about the man as a rational UFO witness as well as a productive member of society. Subsequent columns will be involved with answering the other seven points of my good friend and Editor's \"Comments.\" My long-term investigation of Rev. Bailey's UFO claims and photos may have given some persons the impression that I have no doubt about their authenticity and am trying to persuade everyone to accept them as real. As one of our Presidents said, \"Let me make this perfectly clear.\" My interest in the Bailey photos is based on two factors: (1) They are presented as unique \"material evidence\" by a man whom I consider rational and honest; (2) They lend themselves to photogrammetric analysis, some types of which have not been employed to date, such as deblurring and reduction techniques 13 . They are a challenge I cannot ignore. However, I am open to any evidence or analysis, pro and con, and wish only that the truth concerning them be revealed. If they can be proved as hoaxed, I would happily accept the decision, just as I would happily accept any input which points toward authenticity. This is the only way to proceed on any UFO case — objectively and with an open mind. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1.

The short account accompanying it reads as follows: This UFO is still a mystery no one can explain. In Raub's Chung Ching School, one teacher, Heng Chiang Teck, sighted a bright circular object in the sky while in the school field. He has heard about UFOs and thought it could be what people call a flying saucer. He was carrying a camera at the time and took a photograph of it. He was leading a group of scouts camping in the field at that time. The object remained in ••• view for 1 minute before disappearing. The author wrote to the teacher for further details of the sightings and received 2 copies of the color prints of the strange thing. The photo was taken at about 6:15 p.m. on August 30, 1981. The place was in Raub in Central Malaysia. The UFO was described as saucer-shaped and very bright. It remained stationary for about 6 seconds and then disappeared. Camera type was Yashica FX3 using Sakuracolor 135 ASA 100. Shutter speed was 1/125: Weather condition was described as fine. From the photograph (see cover photo), the \"UFO\" is quite, typical of what is known as a lenticular cloud. The brightness is due to the setting sun. Its stationary nature and situated right above the cloud makes it more obvious that it was just a cloud. If there had been no cloud,.such as over the desert, the sighting may pass as a.genuine UFO. About 3 week's before this photo • was taken, on August 7,1981 at Scudai in Southern Malaysia a brightly lit object was seen descending from the sky at 8:30 p.m. The sighting was reported to the author and the details are as follows: There were 4 witnesses, one adult and 3 children. They were sitting outside the house talking when, their attention was drawn to a strange light. As they watched, the light started to get closer and bigger until at about 500 feet, a saucer-shaped object could be made out. It was described as dark in color and was rotating. The bright light was coming from what appeared to be windows. A bright beam-type of light was also coming out from its base. After 3-5 minutes the UFO ascended rapidly and was lost from sight. There were two other sightings of anomalous lights in the sky for 1981. I It's no o 2 * joking matter •a § Unidentified Flying Objects have been with us since the beginning of recorded his- tory. Thousands, if not millions, of people have reported sightings of UFOs in the ensu- ing centuries and the mystery is still with us. Even here, In the seacoast area, we have many such sightings.; In fact, the seacoast has been put forever on the UFO map with the famous \"Incident at Exeter,\" written by John Fuller a few years back. Portsmouth's well-known Betty Hill is also familiar to local residents because of her and her husband's reported abduction-by an UFO in the north country (the subject of, a popular made-for- television movie). However many sightings are reported, and no matter how respectable the people In- volved in such incidents are, many publica- tions treat the subject with ridicule. This will 'not be the case with the Atlantic News & Ad- vertiser. This editor, for example, saw a UFO in Hampton Falls three years ago and, therefore, cannot rightfully deny the exist- ence of them. , In this and next week's issues, this news- paper will treat the subject in an adult, Intel- . ligent manner. The UFO controversy Is of great concern to many area residents and it is hoped this in-depth coverage of the subject will help to further Inform those so concern- . ed, and also spark interest in people who are somewhat ill-informed on UFOs in the sea- coast. October and November have been known as \"UFO Months\" here In Rockingham Coun- ty due to the many sightings which are re- ported every year at this time. Let us take advantage of this unusual season and see If we can come up with some answers. Your comments are welcome. These are not of much value as they involve a small moving light following a straight course. The closing event for 1981 was the UFO sighting near Seremban. It. was sighted in early November at about 10 p.m. by several drivers along the Seremban-Kuala Lumpur Highway. It was described as diamond-shaped, giving out red, yellow, and blue lights. The center of the object was white in color. The object was reported to be moving very fast. Ground Saucer Watch analysis report on Malaysia photo, Nov. 21, 1982, by W.H. Spaulding: The subject photograph was briefly analyzed using computer enhancement techniques. The brightness of the tenuous image is due to the backlighting angle of the sun and the nearly-elliptical shape is typical for lenticular clouds (double convex shaped). The edges of the image are comparable to features on the other clouds in the photo. There is no evidence that the image is structured nor that it represents an extraordinary flying object.

It is with regret that we must advise our members of the passing of David Stupple, Ph.D., a Consultant in Sociology and a colleague of Ron Westrum's at East Michigan University. Dr. Stupple was a speaker at the 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium in San Francisco. Only 44 years of age, David leaves a wife and two children. He joined MUFON in 1972 and became a Consultant in 1976. Due to the logistics and lead time involved in publishing the MUFON UFO Journal, published information is not always current when received by our members. Events and symposiums may be publicized adequately if your International Director is advised several months before the event is scheduled to take place. Announcing the showing dates of UFO related television programs is very difficult and usually impossible, since they are not released by the networks to our sources. As an example: when we were • notified of the time and showing date for the P.B.S. NOVA series film \"The Case of the UFOs,\" I sent a special letter to all. State Directors notifying them of this fact and the anticipated negative slant, based upon the featured participants. John Mansfield, Executive Producer, was deluged with critical letters as our people responded. Using this communication technique, the timely events in my Director's Message for the April 1983 issue of the Journal were published and mailed in a new MUFON Newsletter to all State and Assistant State Directors by Mrs. Marge Christensen, State Director for Massachusetts. All of us are indebted to Marge for initiating this idea and volunteering to print and mail the newsletter. Favorable reports are being received already. Mrs. Christensen will also extract timely news from this copy and mail to our State Directors. The success of the program will dictate the perpetuation of the newsletter. It is suggested that the State Directors reproduce the Newsletter and distribute to their State Section Directors for greater exposure. 18 The much-awaited third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, edited by Raymond E. Fowler, Director of Investigations, is now available. The manual, which consists of 20 sections or chapters by authorities in each of their respective fields of expertise, .will, cost $6.00 plus $1.50 for postage and handling to current MUFON members. For all others, the price is $10.00 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. The new manual consists of 161 pages, &Y 2 x 11 size, in a three- ring binder format. MUFON has a very adequate supply of sympoisum proceedings from 1975 through 1982 to fill all orders on our publication list, whereas prior issues are out-of-print. We recently obtained 10 copies of the 1973 MUFON Symposium Proceedings held in Kansas City, Missouri on June 16,1973, with papers by W. Andrus, J. Schuessler, T. Phillips, Adrian Vance, B. Downing, S. Friedman and J.A. Hynek. While the supply lasts, they will be $3.50 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. Since this offer is for current members only, when we have depleted our small supply any refunds will be applied to extending your MUFON membership/subscription. We still have copies of Observing UFOs by Richard F. Haines for $5.00 plus $1.50 for. postage and handling. This is an ideal book to complement our new Field Investigator's Manual. John Magor, Provincial Director for British Columbia, has advised that he expects to have copies of his new book, titled Aliens Above — A UFO Report for sale at the MUFON Symposium in Pasadena.

The Foundation for UFO Research has announced the first in a planned series of awards. President Allen Benz said, \"The first award will be for significant work currently being done in UFOlogy. To be eligible, work must have been done since January 1, 1980.\" The amount of this first award will be $100. Benz indicated that nominations will be accepted from members of the UFOIogical community. The nominations will be reviewed by a panel of judges, who will make their recommendations so that the award may be presented during the summer of 1983. R.

That pub- lication's May 10 issue reports on the sighting of a large triangular object in various parts of Great Britain. The May 17 ENQUIRER tells of tall alien beings who ascended into the sky after trying to forcibly enter houses in a region of Bolivia. The Rev. Harrison E. Bailey's claims of encounters with ghost-like aliens are detailed in the \"Anti- Matter/UFO Update\" column in May OMNI. A photo accompanying the story, taken by Bailey, is somewhat less than convincing, to say the least. The June issue of FATE has a good article by Peter Jordan summarizing the case of Scottish forester Robert Taylor, who encountered a UFO and two smaller objects in 1979. Taylor was \"attacked\" by the two objects which resembled \"sea mines\" and was left unconscious. Various theories regarding the incident are examined, with no definite answers forthcoming. Wendelle C. Stevens continues his publishing program, bringing out three or four hardcover volumes per year. AH the books are nicely-done, with photographs, drawings and artwork. UFO...CONTACT FROM PLANET IARGA by Stefan Denaerde is the story of a Dutch multinational industrialist who claims to have gone aboard a spacecraft and to have been shown scenes of life on a distant planet. Later contacts provided him with much additional information, all of which is presented in this 365-page volume. The price is $15.95. The highly controversial Meier contact case from Switzerland is abstracted in a 542-page volume by Stevens, UFO CONTACT FROM THE PLEIADES. It goes without saying that whatever one's criticisms of the case may be, this book should be read before such criticisms are voiced. It contains over 100 photographs, plus a wealth of other data relating to the case. It is priced at $17.95. The most recent book is one which many people have long awaited, UFO CONTACT AT PASCAGOULA. Written by Charles Hickson and William Mendez, it is the \"inside story\" of the famous abduction case at Pascagoula, Mississippi in 1973. Details of hypnosis sessions and psychological tests are presented, as well as the accounts of what Hickson considers to be additional contacts with the UFO occupants. It is well-illustrated with photographs and drawings, selling for $14.95. There is a postage and handling charge of $1.25 on each book. Future books by Stevens include UFOs OVER MODERN CHINA (a collection of 600 significant Chinese UFO cases, translated by that country's JOURNAL OF UFO RESEARCH at the language department University of Peking) and UFO CONTACT FROM PLANET UMMO (a summary of the Ummo contact case, prepared by the well- known Spanish researcher, Antonio Ribera). Both of these books should be available before the end of 1983. All orders should be sent to Wendelle Stevens at P.O. Box 17204, Tucson, AZ 85731.
