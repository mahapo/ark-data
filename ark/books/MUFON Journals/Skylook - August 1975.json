The above photo, reportedly taken by Raul Golan, a profes- sional news photographer for LA CAPITAL, at Mar del Plata, Argentina, at 1:38 p.m. on April 15, 1970, is strikingly similar to the description provided by a Mexican pilot who claims three such UFOs paced and disabled his plane south of Mexico City on May 3 of this year. (The story begins on page 3.) The day after the above photo was taken, professional photographer Rodolfo Hasperue of Buenos Aires reportedly took a photo of another (or possibly the same) UFO over Mar del Plata. The object, reportedly seen by a number of residents, gave off a greenish halo. Witnesses said the object did not move away, but \"evaporated,\" according to the publi- cation LA RAZON.

Short Editor-Publisher Emeritus Editor's Column This has been a somewhat hectic summer for SKYLOOK, as readers have no doubt noticed. The editor has been finishing up a Specialist's Degree in Edu- cation (6th year) this summer, which has been \"hanging fire\" for three years, awaiting tine for completion. The time never seemed to be available, so it had to be taken anyway. Efforts are underway to spread out the work on SKYLOOK a bit more in order to lessen the mag- azine's traditional dependence on the editor. In an essentially voluntary operation, however, qualified personnel with the time to work are not easy to find. At least two areas must be covered more thoroughly in SKY- LOOK than in the past: (1) a special section on routine MUFON investigations, and (2) a sec- tion reporting summaries of routine press reports. Both of these areas require time in or- ganizing, summarizing, and writ- ing. In addition, we need a person to write stories composed of ma- terial from several sources (in- cluding audio tapes) so the edi- tor can spend his time editing instead of writing. Hopefully, we can find at least three qualified \"associate editors\" to handle the functions described above. ********************** MUFON Director Walt Andrus was in the midst of moving to Seguin, Texas, as this issue of SKYLOOK went to press, and was unable to write his monthly &$*• umn.

UFOs pace, disrupt airplane Date of sighting: May 3, 1975 Location of sighting: above lake of Tequesquitengo, near Mexico City, Mexico. EDITOR'S NOTE: The May 3, 1975, report by pilot Carlos Antonio de los Santos Montiel that he was escorted by three UFOs south of Mexico City is one of those frustrating cases that crop up all too frequently. There are several versions of the case, and it is difficult to know which version is most re- liable. The following account will present the information which is currently available, listing the various sources. Ob- viously, this report requires further investigation before any conclusions can be drawn. THE INCIDENT Carlos Antonio de los Santos Montiel was flying at 120 mph in a Piper PA-24 from Zihuatenejo to Mexico City. He was at an altitude of either 14,900 or 15,000 feet (depending upon which version is accepted), and while passing over Lake Teques- quitengo at 1:34 p.m. on May 3, 1975, according to the newspaper LA PRENSA, he felt that his plane was vibrating in a strange manner without apparent cause. Then, along the right side of his plane a 10-12 foot disc ap- peared. Another disc appeared to the left of his plane. He described them as being about ^ feet high and dark gray in color. At the center was a protuberance. Just above this was a small window, and on the upper part a kind of antenna. A third disc was reportedly spotted coming at the plane head-on. LA PRENSA reported that this disc hit the bottom of the plane, according to the pilot, \"giving it a light blow.\" A brief report from The Center for UFO Studies by Dr. J. Allen Hynek in PHYSICAL TRACES ASSOCI- ATED WITH UFO LANDINGS states, \"Soon a third object like the others appeared above nnd in front of his plane, and dropped down and collided with the under part of the fuselage, jolting the plane and the pilot, and disappeared from his view.\" LA PRENSA reported that the pilot \"instinctively on seeing that one of the objects was go- ing to pass underneath his plane pulled on the lever for lowering the landing gear so as to touch it, but the mechanism failed to operate.\" The pilot reportedly felt the plane was being magnetized, \"that is to say, as though it were being lifted up,\" and he believes this may have caused the malfunction of the' landing gear. He had reportedly attempted to wobble the wings of the plane, but the controls would not operate. According to LA PRENSA, the pilot also tried to slow the plane, but\" it continued at 120 mph. (This has some sim- ilarity to the reported case with the \"out of control\" auto in Rhodesia--see March, 1975, SKY LOOK. The pilot, quite shaken by the experience, reported an emergen- cy. According to LA PRENSA, he was weeping and unable to speak at tiroes, but he apparently maintained reasonably constant radio contact with the Mexico City airport. The airport cleared traffic for the pilot, and after awhile he was able to manually lower his landing gear and land. The plane was checked, and a Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"dent and possible scratches were found on the fuselage. Aeronau- tic authorities said the dent was not recent, however. THE PILOT Carlos Antonio de los Santos Montiel, 23, is a veteran of three years (370 flying hours) of flight experience, according to the NATIONAL ENQUIRER. The ENQUIRER quoted Commander Igna- cio Silva de la Mora, an airport inspector, as saying he had known De los Santos \"since he was a kid. He's a trustworthy and dedicated pilot who neither smokes nor drinks.\" The newspaper LA PRENSA quotes Roberto de los Santos Perez, an aircraft maintenance technician at the Mexicana Aviation Co., as saying he knows \"better than anyone else the behavior, the responsibility, and the judgment ef Carlos Antonio.\" De los San- tos Perez said he believes the pilot's story \"due to the fact that he is a very judicious young man without vices, and above all has great desires to become a professional pilot.\" The pilot's father expressed the opinion that \"there is no reason for that circumstance (the sighting) to alter his skill and commitment to his career.\" LA PRENSA describes the pilot as \"a rather straightforward and prudent young man,\" and quoted De los Santos as saying, \"I am not looking for notoriety nor propaganda. Notoriety and show are for artists and sportsmen, not for me.\" De los Santos was examined after his experience, and the doctor -could find nothing.physi- cally or mentally wrong with him. The doctor suggested the possibility that the pilot could have been suffering from hypox- ia, or lack of oxygen, causing him to imagine the saucers. The pilot rejects this theory, and THE ENQUIRER quotes Julio Cesar Interian Diaz, an air traffic controller on duty at the time of the sighting, as Page 4 This is a sketch produced from the memory of pilot Carlos Antonio de los Santos Montiel of one of the three UFOs which he says paced his plane and interfered with its control. \"Gris obscuro\" means \"dark gray.\" saying, \"De los Santos 1 trans- missions on the radio seemed quick _and concise during the period of the incident,\" indi- cating the pilot was not suffer- ing hypoxia. The pilot has said that he was \"terrified,\" was crying, \"and could hardly talk,\" during the episode, but said he maintained his composure. LA PRENSA quotes the pilot as saying, \"At some moments I felt a certain attrac- tion toward them (the objects) as if they were pulling me to- ward them.\" The publication ALERTA, which claims to have listened to the tapes made of the transmissions during the incident, concluded: \"All of the foregoing is record- ed....All of this coincides with what was declared by the pilot, which shows that he was not suf- fering from hypoxia, which also proves he was not the victim of an hallucination nor invented the story in search for publi- city.\" THE PLANE The plane in this incident is a Piper PA-24, with a \"180\" Ly- coming 0-360-A 180 hp engine. It has a wingspan of 36 feet, is 24.7 feet long, and is 7.3 feet high. The top speed of the Piper PA- 24 is 167 mph, and the optimum cruising speed is 160 mph. Its best rate of climb speed is 96 mph, and its rate of climb is 910 feet per minute. The service ceiling is 18,500 feet, and the absolute ceiling is 21,000 feet. THE RADAR An early United Press Inter- national report indicated that two air traffic controllers ob- served the incident on two sep- arate radar screens. However, there is some question as to whether the two controllers, were watching on separate screens or on only one screen. ALERTA reports a radar \"echo,\" indicating an object (in addi- tion to the Piper plane) \"was moving at better than 900 kilo- meters per hour (about 550 mph).\" LA PRENSA belatedly reported a week after the incident that \"a .mysterious signal was record- ed on one of the radar' screens at the Mexico City Center,\" but did not elaborate. The ENQUIRER reported that \"two of them (the objects) made an impossibly sharp turn which baffled air traffic controllers who were tracking them on ra- dar.\" • / •' The ENQUIRER quotes air traf- fic controller Emilio Estanol (Lopez), who reportedly was watching a radar screen, as say- ing, \"The objects made a 270- degree turn at 518 mph in an arc of only three miles. Normally a plane moving at that speed needs eight to ten miles to make a turn like that. In my 17 years as an air traffic controller I've never seen anything like that.\" Also watching a radar screen was Julio Cesar Interian Diaz. The Center for UFO Studies report of the incident, prepared by Dr. J. Allen Hynek and brief- ly reported in PHYSICAL TRACES ASSOCIATED WITH UFO LANDINGS, says, \"The objects on the wings presently rose up and merged in- to one and moved off in an east- erly direction, whereupon the radar operator could see the ob- ject for the first time. It disappeared in ' the direction of the mountain Popocatepetl.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"South River, New Jersey Atypical Humanoidencounter Investigated by Ted Bloecher (Assisted by Dr. and Mrs. Roger Wescott) The South River humanoid en- counter came to light just over ten years after its occurrence, when it was described by the ob- server in a letter dated Novem- . ber 2, 1973, to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, chairman of the Depart- ment of Astronomy at North- western University. At that time, the massive UFO wave of October, 1973, had just crested, producing an unprece- dented number of UFO reports, and Dr. Hynek was in the process of establishing the Center for . UFO Studies in Evanston, Illi- nois. .The letter, outlining the • South River experience of ten years earlier, was put aside to be answered at a later date and '\" was overlooked in the organiza- tion of the Center/ In April, 1975, I learned of the South River encounter from Miss Margo Metegrano, secretary ^ s for the Center. Because the -•' witness lived in New Jersey, not far from New York City, I asked j the Center's permission to fol- low up the report at first hand. j Dr. Hynek wrote to the. witness requesting his assistance in an interview, and an affirmative reply was received and forwarded to me early in May. ..-The witness -received his de- gree in forestry from a Mid- western university in 1961. In j, October; 1963, the week of his \". strange experience, he had at- tended a business conference in Boston. He was coming back from Boston to. go to business meet- ings in Washington, D.'C., the following week, and had planned to stay the weekend at the home of his parents in Matawan, N.J. NARRATIVE BY WITNESS This is what I saw on Oct. 23, 1963, about 11 p.m., near South River, N.J. At, the time— I believe it was a Friday night --I was driving from Boston to Mitawan, N.J., to spend the weekend with my parents, and the following week I was to be in Washington. I missed my turn on the Jersey Turnpike—Exit H--SO I proceed- ed down to the next exit, which was New Brunswick. I got off at New Brunswick and picked up Route 18. There was a back road --at least in 1963--which led from Route 18 through South River to Route 9, so I took this road (The Old Bridge-South Amboy Road), and at one point there is a very sharp turn, almost a 90- degree turn. I slowed down to make that turn, then hit a straightaway, and as I was accelerating to a- bout 50-60 miles an hour, some- thing luminous caught my eye oh the left side of the road. I think I actually turned my head. Then almost instantaneously— a split second later—three sil- verish figures started to cross 34% Sketch of one of the three entities observed near South River, NJ, on Oct. 23,1963. the road in front of me. Zip! Zip! Zip! across the road they came. (He said that the first figure was about three yards a- head of the last two, which were about a yard apart.) I think the light was associ- ated with the figures—an inde- pendent light source they were carrying. (He did not see them carrying a light source but saw it only\" briefly at the point from which they emerged onto the road.) When these things moved, they moved from left to right, across into an area that was wet, which has bothered me: why would they run INTO the cat- tails? You'd think they would go the other way. Now, there was something very unusual about these figures: it was in the way they moved. These figures—three to four feet tall --did not run like a normal human being . would. I would say that their movements were at least twice as. fast as the fast- est sprinter.  , And their leg movements, which I seem to remember mostly—the tremendous speed at which their legs moved—this was what dis- turbed me: the speed, and the actual leg movements. It was Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"almost like they FLUTTERED across the road; they didn't RUN.  . The body movements did not look human to me. There was something very unusual about the movement of the legs that I just can't describe. I don't remem- ber seeing any feet. The thing that sticks in my mind are those legs, those small legs, and how quickly they moved—almost like pistons; sort of spindly, but shaped--there was shape to them. I would say it was almost mus- cular—I could see a calf and a thigh. I'm not certain about the knee (bending) } it's been so long; I'm a little confused about that. REFLECTED LIGHT They were sort of luminous. Actually, it was like a silver- grey. They seemed to glow once they hit the headlights—the beams reflected off them. But not before that. They crossed ahead of the car at a distance of perhaps 50 to 75 feet. It was a clear night—I think I had the high beams on—and I got a good look at them. But I could see no features (The head was not overly large, but was round; seeing no fea- tures, he could not definitely say whether it was or was not a helmet.) except that they were two-legged, and they were faster than any living thing that I have ever seen, including ani- mals. I've seen deer and all kinds of small game and I never saw anything move that fast. The arms seemed to be almost like a person who is running. I think the movement was probably natural. It seemed more of a human thing than a mechanical thing, but just extraordinarily fast. I didn't get a back view, that's how fast they moved; all I got was the profile, a sort of 45-degree angle view. (He saw no buttocks on the figures as they ran into the cattails.) My .immediate reaction was just let the automobile come to a stop, but I didn't put the brakes on. I let it sfop a mile Page 6 down the road. It sort of frightened me. I was going to go back and take a look at this —whatever I saw, but after con- sidering the fact that it was a sort of desolate, lonely area and I had not even a flashlight, I decided to forget about it and just go on about my business. AFRAID TO GO BACK I was actually afraid to go back and look. I hate to admit that, but man, I'll tell you, that's the only time in my life that I know I experienced fear. I actually was afraid! That made the hair stand up on my head, or whatever that sensation is. I was afraid because I felt there were three of these things and only one of me. Yeah,. I'm bigger, but whatever I saw, I just didn't think they were— normal, and so I didn't want to get involved in .anything I did not know about. I didn't go back, and I didn't report it for the reason that I just didn't want the publicity. I looked at the speedometer •and actually wrote down the reading. I knew the vehicle had stopped a half mile beyond where I saw them; I clocked the dis- tance out to the junction with Route 9 and I had a record of this; but then I changed my mind and decided not to say anything to anybody, and I lost the records^ But I'm almost certain it was 2.4 or 2.8 miles from the junction of Route 9. (According to his reference points on the geological survey, map, the dis- .tance from the encounter site to Route 9 is under 2.4 miles.) After a while, I began to . think that what I had seen was something extraterrestrial, be- 'cause of all the UFO sightings That's why I wrote the letter (to Dr. Hynek): I was interest- .ed to know if there was a UFO sighting in that area, because then I would feel that maybe there was some relationship. I hadn't read much (about UFO's); I had heard.about them, naturally, in the newspapers and all, but since then I've been much more interested. STATEMENT BY WIFE Well, it was like a week later, when he came home—I don't really remember how long he was gone at the time, he traveled so much—but he told me about it and I thought it seemed rather stupid. I mean, it sound- ed weird,, you know, these strange little guys—they were small, he said, very small, and dressed in silvery (clothes), and zipped across the road real fast. And I laughed! Well, I'm STILL laughing. Oh, I believed him, but I thought: Ah! I don't know, it probably sounds like children. And yet he kept saying, No, .it couldn't have been children be- cause they were too fast and they, were silver, and I said, yeah, but because they were small, probably it was some teenagers involved in some prank or something. . He kept saying, no, no, it wasn't anything human. I really don't know. I think he saw some- thing. He just came home so ab- solutely positive he saw some- thing unusual that...I'm con- vinced he saw something, but what I really don't know. At the same time I was glad he didn't go back. I thought that was very wise. I'd read a few articles, of course, of people disappearing. I- didn't encourage him to report it be- cause I really didn't think any- body 'd believe him. DISCUSSION BY BLOECHER In citing the most convincing testimony regarding a reported encounter with strange, unident- ified beings, one could scarcely find a more exemplary reporter than this witness, So far as can be determined from a single face-to-face meet- ing (and several exchanges of letters and telephone calls), the credibility of this witness seems to be beyond any reason- able question, and his character"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"above reproach.. - ^ .'• .He: is 7 obviously an..\" intelli- gent and .hard-working young man who, over a period of a few years, developed his own busi- . ness, now .serving a national clientele in its special field. He is a responsible family man with a wife and three children who live in a modest but com- fortable home in the community where .his business is located. It seems entirely .unlikely that the witness would create out of whole cloth a strange story.like the South River en- counter,, and to deceive his own family with his continued disim- ulation. For what purpose? Such behavior would not be consistent with his character or disposi- tion. His credentials are such that our initial skepticism is assuaged. He is certain that he saw what he says he saw, and no more; it is difficult for us to blink it away. In addition, his is by no means a unique exper- ience, being just another piece of a complicated puzzle of'grow- ing dimensions and about which he quite clearly has only limit- ed knowledge. 'DETECT AND ESCAPE' Compared to some other hunan- oid reports, this experience was brief, relatively straightfor- ward and uncomplicated. It is a fine example of the. \"detect-and- escape\" variety of encounter (a descriptive term for cases in which the witness 1 attention is caught by some device—a light, in the witness 1 case, or per- haps the close flyby of a UFO— followed by the brief, but, ex- plicit exposure of several be- ings who then make a seemingly frantic effort to avoid detec- tion by escaping into a nearby woods^ or into a ; UFO that waits conveniently nearby, which then departs at high speed). This serves as a prototype for other reports that could have been drawn from the same scenario: a single and unwit- ting participant is driving a car or truck down a deserted back road. The time (usually) is late at night or very early morning. The scene is usually short but unforgettable for the unsuspecting driver: a flash or a bang, followed by the abrupt appearance and hasty departure, upon exposure, of two or three (usually) smallish figures of 'unusual appearance and behavior. An unidentified flying object is optional, being present more often than not. The diligent researcher is a- ware of the genre: the classic case of this type, of course, is the report by Patrolman Lorinie Zamora at Socorro, N.M., on April 24, 1964, (See J. Allen Hynek's THE UFO EXPERIENCE (Reg- nery, 1972), pp. 144-45.) al- though it occurred during day- light and.not at night. Another example is Stanley Moxon's encounter with two lit- tle figures and a UFO on a back road near Joyceville, Ontario, on August 23, 1967. (Kingston WHIG-STANDARD, August\" 2.4,_ 1967.) As his car lights lit up .the scene, .the beings retreated hastily within their/vehicle which then rapidly departed. . There are numerous examples, some from abroad, but one inci- dent that occurred at Rockvilie, VA., on May 11, 1969, is of such striking similarity to the South River case that a summary is in- cluded later in this report, as it has. - not been, published^pre- viously. CATEGORIES OF SIGHTINGS It may be important to pay more attention to. the relation- ship between entities and uni- dentified flying objects. It is possible that we are dealing with several different phenom- ena, and by noting these : asso- ciations, we may be able to dis- cover, what these differences are. '  \" • Reports appear to fall into •five (or six) categories, which may be defined as follows: - A.-Explicit Occupancy: entity observed only within an object, through window or \"port,\" or in open \"door.\" B. Direct Association: entity observed entering and/of leaving object at some point during en- counter. ' C. Implicit .Association': en- tity seen in immediate environs of object, though not, seen..en- tering or leaving it. , ''/,'. D. Circumstantial Association: entity observed during general UFO activity in area by indepen- dent witnesses. \" t . E. No known . association be- tween entity and UFO.s. . . F. No obje.ct or entity seen, 'but \"contact\" alleged, or some psychic experience, (\"messages,\" automatic writing, etc.). The South River encounter,';of course, belongs to the fifth category (Type E),. because, the witness observed no UFO,..and there•wa s no record 'of UFO ac- tivity in that area. . In • the following incident, strikingly similar but for this single feature,\" a .UFO was re- ported to have been seen .approx- imately two hours prior to.the encounter and less than . half, a mile away. It is a Type . D ex- ample. '...\",.

At 1:45 a.m., on Sunday, May 1-1, 1969,' Luczkowich was driving home after visiting his girl Page 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"friend in Rockville, VA. He had turned south onto Route 622 and was passing the Rockville gen- eral store when he saw something standing in the road directly a- head of him at a distance of about 50 yards (as measured at the site). His first thought was that they were a couple of deer, but almost immediately he saw that they were two small humanoid figures, three-and-a-half to four feet tall and wearing large .spherical helmets as large as basketballs. Running around the helmets was a vertical circle that reflected the car's head- lights with.a pale green color. The figures were standing motionless when they were caught in the car's light beams, but almost immediately they scuttled off to the witness' left, scrambling up an .embankment overgrown with weeds and vines. They had barely disappeared into a field of barley at the top-of the four-foot embankment when a third figure dashed into view from the right side of the road, clearly visible' in the headlights, about 25 yards in front of the car; it, too, clambered up the bank and van- ished into the' field. The third figure moved at very,high speed. COVERALL-TYPE GARMENTS Luczkowich said the men were dressed in light brown coverall- type garments that appeared somewhat baggy in the legs but fit snugly at the ankles. He could not recall having seen their arms and was unable to see any features behind the round helmets. Shaken by the experience, he told no one about it until late on Sunday. Monday afternoon he returned to the site with Ray Ricketts and two others. They found a definite trail in the poison ivy and honeysuckle on the bank off the left side of the road; at the top was a path trodden into the barley field. This ended after a few feet in two flattened areas where small entities had evidently thrown themselves down in the grain: the crushed barley in one of these impressions showed the imprints of two small bodies; the other of only one. The site was visited by a- nother NICAP staff member the next week, but by that time the barley had been mowed, and all traces were gone. Unfortunately, no photographs had been taken before the barley was cut. Half a mile to the west and two hours earlier, 18-year-old Debbie Payne was being, driven back to her home following a date when she noticed something luminous, of oval shape, appear over her home at the end of the lane. Only briefly visible, it brightened and went out, and re- appeared twice before the couple reached Miss Payne's house. The report is not very strong: according to Miss Payne, her es- cort did not see the object, and he refused to participate in an inquiry or to give out his name. Except for the proximity of time and place, any connection be- tween the UFO sighting and the humanoid encounter is purely speculative. CONCLUSION The Rockville and South River encounters have much in common: the same number of figures of similar size and appearance were seen in each case, and their be- havior is of such remarkable un- iformity it can hardly be ignor- ed. It seems reasonable to con- clude that if these beings had wanted to remain concealed or unobserved, it would have been a simple matter to do so. The noise and lights of the ap- proaching vehicles gave ample warning of the arrival of po- tential spectators, and yet their actions suggest that con- cealment was not their inten- tion: they meant to be seen by these two unsuspecting observ- ers, and we can only guess why. It is my opinion that the South River witness observed a Sketch by Michael Luczkowich of one of / r , three entities observed at Rockville, VA, on May 11,1969. ^ group of three small, humanoid ^ figures of unusual appearance and behavior on a back road in October of 1963, whose origin and purpose remain unknown. There are compelling reasons to believe they bear some rela- tion to a similar group of fig- ures encountered five and a half years later on a back road at Rockville, Virginia. Both of these incidents are unexplained.

Hid- den cases' continue to surface, and our present total of 64 re- ports for the wave year of 1973 includes 15 additional refer- ences that have come to our at- tention since the publication of Webb's 1973--YEAR OF THE HUMAN- OIDS, just six months ago! •The 1974 total -now stands at 38 cases (as of June, 1975), an average yearly total that some- what exceeds the norm (30 per annum for 900 cases between 1946 and.1975). Several of these 1974 reports are potentially signifi- cant cases. Bloecher presented a paper on the 1974 cases at the MUFON Symposium in Iowa in July. His presentation, \"A Catalog of Humanoid Reports for 1974,\"' was published in the 1975 Symposium Proceedings. .The Center for UFO Studies has recently, provided us with many leads on-a number of inter- esting cases, including many .of those described below. Peter Rogerson, formerly an editor-of the British Merseyside UFO BUL- LETIN- (MUFOB), recently, present- ed us with a \"list of more than 40 English references. -We are also currently in touch with French sources who have exten- sive humanoid files. The HSG is actively pursuing followups on a number of older cases. The more, than 20 listed below are those for which speci- fic followups are underway,. or for which material has already been received. . \" - Listed with each, report is the date, location, time, brief summary, 'and the status of 'the investigation. Please write to either Bloecher or Webb if you have further leads in any . of these cases, or for any refer- ences that have not as yet come to our attention. . Once again we would like to thank the many MUFON represent- atives arid friends who have con- tributed material to the HSG files. Without this, splendid assistance, our efforts to in- crease the HSG's input would be much more difficult.. We appre- ciate your interest and co-oper- ation. September, 1951. Near Joliet, IL. Night.

Location of sighting: Mellen, . WI. On' the night of March 13, 1975, the Philip Baker family was watching the beginning of \" the \"Harry-0\" TV program and 15- -v year-old Jane Baker was taking ' the cats to the garage where \"' they stayed each night. As she * reached the garage door, Jane heard \"strange high-toned nois- es.\" She looked to the north and saw what appeared to be an ob- ject' sitting on, or just above, the road which goes over a hill north of their home. The hill, which was snow-covered, was lit up by the object, according to the witness. Jane described the object as disc-shaped, silver, with a domed top, giving- off an overall yellowish-white glow. Flashing red and green lights were locat- ed around the middle of the ob- ject. After putting the cats in the garage, Jane summoned ' her father.. The two went back out- side and the object was still at the same location, about 320 feet away. However, there was now a square area in the middle of the object which appeared to be an opening and which gave off the same yellowish-white glow that had surrounded the entire object earlier. (The overall glow was subsiding at this point, and there were no flash- ing red and green lights nor noise.) The two then walked to their driveway, about 300 feet from the object, where they heard what appeared to be the banging of metal against metal. (This of course suggests the possi- bility of a repair operation; see the July, 1975, SKYLOOK.) Other members of the family-- Mrs. Baker, 16-year-old. Monty, 12-year-old John, and 11-year- old Jeff—also saw the \"object through a window. Mr. Baker and Jane went \"back into the house, where the father called the sheriff's office. As he was talking- on the :phone, they heard a loud \"boom\" from outside. Jane looked through the window and the obj ect had disappeared. The next day Jane went out. to examine the landing site. Look- ing towards a swampy area of pine trees she again saw what appeared to be the object seen the night before. This time, however, the object was hovering over the.trees. . .There was no glow, nor were there any flash- ing lights nor sound. Jane went back into the house to get heav- ier clothing. .When .she came back out, she brought the family dog. As she proceeded towards the object, the dog yelped, whined, pawed at its ears, then became completely still. Jane took the dog back into the house, and when she re- turned, the object was gone. Later that morning, .she, Monty, and John walked to the site where the object had been seen on (or slightly above) the road the previous night. They found-a round area on the road where the snow was \"fluffed up,\" obliterating, bicycle tracks made .before the object was sighted. An. auto track through the \"fluffed up\" area indicated that a car had passed over the site between the time the object had been seen and the time the site was examined by the witnesses. It was estimated that the ob- ject was approximately 12 feet in diameter. There were reportedly several additional sightings in the area of Ashland, WI., about 20 miles north of Mellen, the night . of March 13. The UFO conference in Ft. Smith, Ark., scheduled for Oct. 17-19 has . definitely expanded from an area conference to a national conference, according to Bill Pitts, director.

The article contains some errors, but also has some points of interest and is better than most of the articles of this type in MEN, MALE, STAG and other such magazines. HARPER'S WEEKLY devoted two pages to the UFO subject in their June 13 issue.

Spencer always makes much of the fact that he was once a NICAP member.

This case has not been investigated by UFO researchers, and is printed only as a mat- ter of possible interest. The only informa- tion thus far comes from the following article which was printed in the Aug. 2, i 1975, issue of the CAPE ARGUS, Cape i Town, Union of South Africa. (The article v was sent to SKYLOOK by Cynthia Hind, , MUFON representative for Rhodesia, through Joe Brill. By Ted Olsen . The mysterious metallic sphere which crashed to earth on Tues- day night, narrowly missing a Joubertina farmhouse and shat- tering a granite-hard boulder, has created a storm of intrigue and talk of UFOs in the Southern Cape district. . Yesterday I visited Oudtshoorn where the' blackened ball is under police guard. At an arranged time and brief- ing on security precautions, .1 was allowed to examine the strange round object which has the town buzzing with specula- tion. Where it came from no one has been able to say. \"A few things are certain—it never came from outer space or it would have disintegrated. Its construction would lead us to believe it was man-made,\" an ex- pert from a government depart- ment involved in the investiga- tion told me. \"But what is bothering us is that so far we have not been able to identify the metal. It must be extremely hard and it must have fallen from a great- height, as it shattered a boul- der when it struck earth and is only slightly dented.\" The mystery deepened when farmers in the Joubertina and Matjies River areas disclosed that the sphere fell to earth after a bright UFO had been spotted streaking across the night sky. For several nights bright red, green and White balls of light had flashed soundlessly over the farming district. Police were called and con- firmed the UFO mystery. But they were unable to answer the farm- ers' questions. Then on Tuesday, just hours after the last UFO sighting, Louis Mtwa, a labourer's son on the farm Kransfontein, which be- longs to Mr. Japie .Kritzinger, found the sphere near the farm- house—lying amid splinters of shattered rock. A gaping hole in the hollow ball had led experts to believe it was involved in some kind of explosion. Now a special government de- partment in • Pretoria has been notified'by telegram and a de- cision is being taken on where to-ship the cause of the mystery for closer inspection. : . Faint lettering in what ap- pears to be code on the shell has served to heighten the in- trigue. After a few minutes with the ball, I was ushered out of the security area. Outside on the streets, in shops and cafes, people were discussing the enigma. It was any man's guess—the Russians, the CIA, intelligent beings from somewhere out there, some unwel- come night visitor had left a calling card. \"One good thing—it might help shabby winter tourist busi- ness along a bit if you let enough people know what we have here in Oudtshoorn,\" a taxi driver told me on the way back to the airport and Cape Town.\"\"' QUARTER CENTURY STUDIES OF UFOs'I N ?

Location of sighting: Hampton Beach N.H. ;• also surrounding areas. Investigators: Dave Webb, MUFON State Director for Massachusetts; and John Oswald, Massachusetts UFO Re- search Center. Further details have been uncovered on the Hampton Beach, N.H. occupant report of May 20, 1974, outlined in the September 1974, issue of SKYLOOK. In- vestigation has provided evi- dence that .the entire story could have been a hoax. The witness (we will call him P) works summers at Hampton Beach, an ocean-side resort area in southeastern New Hamp- shire. In an interview, P's employer during the. summer of 1973 said that P had fabricated an intricate story about some . stolen money, a story to which P later confessed. Although his 1974 summer em-. ployer was satisfied with his work, P quit his job two weeks after his alleged sighting, having been on the job only a month. He left no forwarding address and we are out of touch with him. Could he have quit his job to avoid having to con- fess to another lie? Added to the implications mentioned in our first report, i.e. P has some possible mental problems, he professes some strange religious beliefs, and he is a \"repeater,\" we are left with little choice but to as- sign the label \"Possible Hoax\" to this report until the wit- ness can be traced for further questioning. Included are two sketches of the craft drawn by the witness and a map of the area. Despite the doubts cast on the witness 1 credibility, this report re- mains of interest because of a small flap that was taking place in .the southern New Hamp- shire and eastern Massachusetts area at the time. Two of these .sightings were mentioned in our initial report. The June 6 case in South Hampton (about 5 mi west of Hampton Beach) was re- ported on p. 11 of the. Septem- ber SKYLOOK. Six other . cases have been completely or par- tially investigated in this area in . the . May-June 1974 period. These, are described below in chronological order. April 28: Greenland, N.H. A low flying, orange UFO describ- ed as looking like a hockey puck was seen in the vicinity of Pease AFB. It was moving very rapidly. The Portsmouth, N.H., police were notified at 1:10 a.m. by the single male witness. (Investigated by John Oswald.) May 19: (probable date): Nassua, N.H. A mother, daughter, and son observed a bright ob- ject about % mi away at 9 p.m. It hovered, then seemed to move into a nearby forest.- No evi- dence cf a landing was found.

A woman saw a series of 3 lights fly by her window at 9:30 p.m. They were each estimated to be no larger than two ft, and only 5-10 ft away! This was the evening after the.Hampton Beach case and 1 14 mi WSW. (Investi- gated by John Oswald.) June 8: Gloucester> Mass. - At about 2:30 a.m. a woman saw a large, oscillating object described as a bright silver disc with .a line . of blurred windows. .Preliminary .investi- gation indicates the possibil- ity of an astronomical •, misi- dentification. . Gloucester is 22. mi south of-Hampton Beach. June 14: Nassua, N.H. There were three separate encounters between 12:35 and 2 a.m.- of an upside down saucer-shaped UFO that rose up from behind trees ' only 300 ft from the witness. \" It was very large, wilth a me- tallic upper part and darker \" lower half joined by red lights around the rim.

June 18: Sudbury, Mass. -At 9:30 p.m. a. bright, -yellow pul- sating ball was seen by 4 people crossing the sky in a- bout 2 min. At about 10 p.m. they saw a similar object'only 300 ft. away.

Ted Phillips suggested, however, that since SKYLOOK's circulation was quite small then, perhaps most of our current readers have not heard of this case. It is short and interesting, so we agreed that it might be worthwhile to describe it again, including drawings. By Ted Phillips This sighting took place at 0700 on Feb. 14, 1967, in a very rugged portion of the state about 30 miles south of Jeffer- son City, Mo. The witness, a 63-year-old farmer, was walking to a barn located about 100 feet east of his- home when he noted a cow looking out into a field. just east of the barn. He then saw a gray-green object 335 feet away and thought it was a parachute. As he neared the barn he could see the object was a disc, rest- ing pn a shaft which extended downward from the center of the base. Beneath, the object he could see several small crea- tures which were moving about rapidly. They seemed to have levers or arms which were also moving rapidly. The creatures were - also gray-green in color and had wide set eyes; he could not see any legs. The witness placed a bucket of feed inside the barn and ap- proached the. object. The sun was just rising and the ground was well illuminated. As he reached the first of two fences, he paused and \"as'I came through: the first gate I picked up two rocks, pretty good size, one of them was. I got up to about 30 feet . of it and it was .sitting there kind of rock- ing slightly, and I thought, boy here goes, I'm going to knock a hole in that thing and see what the hell it is. I cut down on it, and the rock stopped along about 15 feet from it and just hit the ground. The next rock I thought I would throw on top of it and it just hit something and bounced.\" Just before the rock-throwing incident, the witness noted that the creatures moved around be- hind the shaft and disappeared. At that point he was only 80 feet from them. \"I thought I was going right up to it, I got up to about here (15 feet from the object) and there it was, I just walked up against a wall, I couldn't see it at all, there was just a pressure.\" He described the object: \"It just looked like a big shell, grayish-green looking outfit, underneath there were oblong holes where the lights were com- ing out. They were so bright you couldn't see when .you got up there.\" As he stood there, 15 feet from the object, it started to rock slightly off the vertical; it did this six times before it took off. \"When it took off, it just rocked back and moved real fast to the left of that ridge. It made no sound and disappeared in seconds. It didn't make any sound at all, no odor at all. The shaft was pulled up into it as it took off. I never seen anything like it, it looked like silk or something, I couldn't tell though, if I could have hit it with that rock....\" The witness described the .ob- ject as a disc, rounded at the top, flattened at the base. It was some.12-15 .feet in diameter and about 6 feet .thick. .It was resting on a shaft 2% feet in height, 18 inches in diameter, the surface was described as more like silk than metal. No seams or rivets could \" be seen. Around the lower rim, several holes, oblong with a diameter of 6-8 inches, about 1 foot- apart. The light was constantly chang- ing colors: \"They were all the ..colors'of the rainbow.\" The object was seen for about 5 minutes. No traces were found. It took this writer several months to locate the witness as he would not talk to reporters. His sighting was made known by his brother after he witnessed a landing five nights later on his farm just across the road. His observation took place on Feb. 19, 1967. At about 2130 he went outside to investigate his dogs who were barking loudly. He saw a reddish light 140 feet from his house. He approached the light and walked to within 90 feet of it. It suddenly be- came multi-colored arid climbed vertically to an. altitude of a- bout 300 feet, .turned bright green and disappeared at high speed. No sound was heard.

Downing Author of THE BIBLE AND FLYING SAUCERS B.A. Hartwick College (major in physics) B.D. Princeton Theological Seminar Ph.D. University of Edenburgh (science and religion) THE DAY OF CELESTIAL VISITA- TION (Second Edition), by Ernest P. Moyer, Exposition Press, Inc., Hicksville, New York, 1975, $12.50). Published in 1970 under the title GOD, MAN AND THE UFO'S. In many ways Ernest P. Moyer 1 s THE DAY OF CELESTIAL VISITATION is one of the best efforts so far to seek a religious solution to the UFO problem. Still, I doubt that it will have a very wide reading. I will outline what the book does, and then explain why it will not be too popular. The real strength of the book lies in the fact that it raises one of the most serious problems facing a scientific study of UFO's—the problem of revela- tion. Moyer is trained as an electrical engineer, but he has the grasp of the nature of sci- entific method that is philo- sophically close to Jacques Vallee. He is 'not a typical engineer! SCIENCE AND CONTACTEES There are many problems in the UFO field, but perhaps none so great as to how to treat scien- tifically UFO contact cases, especially when the contact in- volves some message to the cori- tactee. NICAP has more or less avoided contact cases all to- gether. If UFO's stay in the air, and are chased by Air Force jets, that's fine. But if they Page 16 land on the ground and UFO be- ings start talking to humans, or take them on board their craft, forget it! This fear of the contact case is partly legitimate. The con- tactee may be out to take US for a ride, or to gain public ex- posure through sensational re- ports. But at the same time that part of us refuses to be- lieve the contact reports, there is another part which asks, \"If UFO's are there, why don't they contact us?\" The answer, of course, is maybe they have, but we don't believe it. One case in point is that of Barney and Betty Hill, described by John Fuller .in INTERRUPTED JOURNEY. Is this a true contact case, a fraud, or .a case of psychologi- cal transference? Even if we knew for sure the Hill case was a fact, we then have another problem. How does scientific method deal with rev- elation material—that is, what the UFO beings said to Betty and Barney? Scientists are used to dealing with a reality which does not try to hide facts from them. Reality may be hidden from the scientist—he may not under- stand why the law of gravity works—but he does not believe the law of gravity is playing games with him, or trying . to hide from him, or showing only part of itself to him. He be- lieves if he looks hard enough, what is hidden will be revealed. But what if you are dealing with an intelligent reality from another world— : space beings, angels, God, or whatever--and what if these beings have a hid- den motive for showing us some facts, and hiding others? How can the scientist deal with this? How can he keep from being minipulated? How can he really prove anything? He can't. There science as we know it ends. It is here that Meyer's book begins. For that reason, pure scientists will not like Moyer's book. Still, Moyer is raising an important issue, although a very uncomfortable one. PROBLEMS OF REVELATION Revelation is usually thought of as a religious issue—in fact, scientists have usually been content to leave revelation material\" to religious people. How do religious leaders deal with the problem of revelation? How do you know what revelations to believe, and what not? The church has solved this problem by developing a canon— The Bible—that is, a body of material which the church has labeled \"true\" revelation. Other revelations—the modern person who claims to have seen angels, or the Virgin Mary, are usually shot down. Most religious lead- ers treat revelation as some- thing that happened during Bible times, but not now. •From a scientific point of view, there is no logical or em- pirical proof that revelations happened then, but not now. Still, the average clergyman cannot spend his \" life running around checking out every person' who claims to have a revelation, so the church's canon rule is something I believe in as of practical help to me, although not justified in any way in terms of what is TRUE. MOYER'S ANSWER Which finally brings us to Moyer's book. There are three parts to it. Part I deals with what he believes to be legiti- mate 'modern contact UFO cases-- including Jonathan Swift's GUL- LIVER' s TRAVELS as the first modern case. He sees the \"fly-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"f JT Dr. R.

English liter- ature people will say Moyer's theory is wild—Swift was a satirist, not a UFO contactee. Moyer argues that Swift used satire to save his own neck. He did not dare tell the truth in undisguised form. Swift's- rev- elation from UFO beings is it- self disguised in a hidden form. We have a revelation in a revel- ation. Other contact cases used by Moyer are. George Adamski, Daniel Fry, Villas-Boas, and the Hills. Adamski and Fry have not been accepted by' the scientific UFO community. Therefore, Moyer will not make many friends by accept- ing the possibility that their stories are essentially true. I say essentially because Moyer says we have to take into ac- count the personalities of the contactees-.-who were deliberate- ly chosen by the UFO beings be- cause of their unique personal- ity types, as part of the over- all revelation plan. THE EARTH'S HISTORY Part II of Moyer's book at- tempts to deal with the whole human history of the earth. It boggles the mind to think of having this as Part II of a three part book! Moyer thinks that the main problem of human history goes back to a time when the earth was shifted on its axis so that our inclination of more than 20 degrees gives us our wild weather patterns—sum- mer, winter, high winds. Before this axis shift, the weather conditions were the same year round. When the shift came a- bout, probably due to the sink- ing of a continent, all hell broke loose, or actually, a great flood. Moyer examines the Bible and many ancient myths concerning the .life of man before and after the Deluge. Most scholars would fault Moyer for treating myths as historical facts, just as they would fault him for treat- ing Swift's satire as disguised revelation. I found this section of the book rather difficult reading. Furthermore, Moyer here introduces the URANTI BOOK as a source of revelation as\" di- vinely inspired as the Bible. I can't prove the book does not come from on high, but my in- stincts, if not my scientific method, are suspicious ; . BIBLICAL CONTACT CASES Part III finally gets to the specifically religious end to- ward which Moyer lias been mov- ing. He begins it with an ex- cellent chapter on the problem of time and space as a revela- tional issue. Others have worked with the problem, too, however, and he does not mention them. He deals then with specifically Biblical UFO contact cases— Moses,- Elijah, Ezekiel, Jesus, and' Paul—materials which- have been dealt with in.other book's. He does not mention Josef Blum- rich's THE SPACESHIPS -OF EZEK- IEL, although it was published after the 1970 . edition of Moyer's work. . , In any case, the outcome of the whole thing is a kind of LATE GREAT PLANET EARTH thesis, such as that of Hal Lindsey, whom. Moyer does not mention either. The angels, the messen- gers, have been telling us that if we don't shape up morally, we will blow .ourselves up with an atomic holocaust. On balance, 1 admire the.hard work that Moyer lias put in to try to cover the ground he has marked out for himself. There arc very few people 1 know who know enough to give his book a fair review.

By Richard Hall MUFON International Coordinator Ron Westrum 1 s article in the June 1975 SKYLOOK, continuing our friendly debate on how to cope with spacemen, gives me a much better understanding of his views. I. find much to commend in the application of insights from sociology to UFO research. There are many - useful sugges- tions and much food for thought. When it comes to theorizing a- bout extraterrestrial intelli- gence (ETl), we part company. Exactly why is clearer to me as a 'result of the article. - Aztecs and Spaniards I agree 'that we may be to the ITIs as the Aztecs were to the Spaniards. But what this example really tells us is that the Az- tecs could not explain the Span- ish ships, horses, and hardware in terms of their own technol- ogy/culture. So they were baf- fled, and self-deceived into thinking the Spaniards were gods. In some parallel way, we may be self-deceived in' our \"spaceship\" interpretation of UFOs. However, is it wise, or even necessary, to jump from there to the notion that the ETl \"Spaniards\" are deliberately de- ceiving the 20th Century \"Az- tecs\"? Ron now. depicts something akin to controlled and purpose- ful \"information management,\" along with testing, to prepare us for contact. That is an in- teresting idea to keep in mind. Still, the same baffling phenom- ena that Ron finds it necessary to account for in this way can, in my view, be accommodated more simply and directly by consider- ing them to be cultural/tech- nological displays for which we have no adequate analogies in Page 18 our 20th Century \"Aztec\" soci- ety; therefore they baffle us. If these phenomena are artifi- cial ones intended to dec!eve us, the ITIs need not be \"omnis- cient\" or \"omnipotent\" to befud- dle us. We regularly mislead animal and human;, subjects in psychological tests. All that is needed is to hold all the cards and to-be in the controll- ing position. There is no reason to believe that we can influence or control the ETIs in any way. A 'Narrow Gap' What we are observing could be a \"narrow gap\" on the order of Spaniard/Aztec, in which voyag- ers from space, roughly humarioid in form, are coming here in ve- hicles whose technology we don't understand. Or, considering some of the more bizarre \"high strangeness 1 cases, a \"wide gap,\" in which the supposed be- ings are of a form or origin be- yond our present concepts. This would be even more baffling, without even considering' mo- t i ves. It seems to me to\" be a cir- cular argument to impute motives or purposes (tactical deception,, testing, preparation for inter- species contact) to our hypo-, thetical spacemen in order to account for some of the baffling phenomena which have provided the basis for our \"spacemen\" hypothesis to begin with. We think they are spacemen because of the extraordinary \"vehicles\" and \"occupants\" that have been observed, and the rest remains to be explained. Ron would \"ex- plain\" the rest by supposing the spacemen have a certain set of motives or intentions. I would \"explain\" the rest by supposing that it flows directly from the cultural/technological gap, from relative human ignorance and in- experience. In my view., we.don't have any way of knowing the an- swer at present, and can only guess from among a number of possibilities until we gather and analyze a lot more data. Risky Business I maintain that it is a risky business and possibly self-de- ceiving to project human notions of \"strategy\" and \"deception\" onto spacemen, and even more so to insist that we \"must\" adopt this approach. At the same time, I recognize the essential reasonableness of what Ron is suggesting. Human travellers to another populated planet might well conceal certain facets of their capabilities or intentions from the natives^ for various reasons that are not hard'to im- agine. But reasoning from human analogies could take us far a- field from the truth unless the ETIs think and behave very much like we do. Behind the phenomena there may be neither gods nor conquer- ors, nor even friendly visitors with whom it is possible to in- teract and communicate. Suppose the ETIs are to us as we are to ants? Suppose \"they\" are inter- ested in us only as biological and sociological specimens? Sup- pose \"they\" are preparing to use the earth as an Eniwetok atoll to test some super space weapon and its effects on biological beings? Suppose \"they\" are not spacemen at all in the accepted sense, and are entities from another dimension or time frame? Regardless of which hypotheses we explore, Ron's suggestions a- bout preparing for culture shock are well worth considering. Both the Spaniards and the Aztecs were of the same species (HOMO- SAP I ENS), and it is not incon- ceivable .that they could have achieved understanding and har- mony. If the ETIs. are bene-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ficent, and not too dissimilar, and if their intention is to make contact, we have our work cut out for us. But if the ratio is ETI/ant, we had better stay out from under foot. The point is that we have no way of know- ing what STRATEGY to adopt with- out first knowing where we stand vis-a-vis the ETIs. A Conclusion My basic conclusion is that ''we ought to back off from over- \" commitment to one possible ex- planation; instead, we should . objectively gather and study data on those baffling phenomena we all agree are there and dis- cern as much as we can about them, continually testing and exploring various hypotheses in the process. In that spirit, exploring the implications for humanity of various possible ex- planations in a worthwhile en- terprise.

Creature sightings reported again in Pennsylvania By Stan Gordon Sightings of large hairy an- thropoidal-like creatures are again increasing throughout sec- tions of Pennsylvania. The pat- terns are quite consistent with those which were uncovered in our investigations into the 1973 Pennsylvania creature flap. (For details see the 1974 MUFON Sym- posium Proceedings.) Since June, 1975, we have had \"Bigfoot\" re- ports from six counties, and many other reports are being -followed up. More recently, on July 2, two men were fishing in a wooded area outside of Youngwood, Pa., when they heard a strange \"gur- gle-like growl\" coming from be- hind them. In a few minutes the sound became louder and the wit- nesses saw a creature which they can only describe as an \"over- grown gorilla.\" The creature, which was described as being over 9 foot tall and as wide as a refrigerator, began to ap- proach the fishermen in a hop- ping-like fashion. An investigation of the area by the Pennsylvania Center For UFO Research turned up some pos- sible footprints (three-toed tracks), as well as matted out areas in the high grass where the creature was first seen. On July 10 a police officer in Washington County was patrol- ing a back road about 4 a.m. when suddenly a large figure leaped from the side of the road directly into the path of his cruiser's headlights. The figure was several feet down the road, but seemed curious about the car. The officer described the creature as being about 7 feet tall. It had long arms and was stooped over like a man with a bad back. It also had a large head that had a rounded off point at the top. The figure, after leaping into the middle of the road, looked at the police car for a few seconds then turned and leaped several feet into a wooded area and went out of sight. The police officer stated that he didn't even tell his wife about the incident be- cause he thought no one would believe him. On July 14 at approximately 12:30 a.m. a father and son traveling on Interstate 70 in Washington County saw a large hairy creature run in front of their vehicle and up the embank- ment on the right side of the road. The two witnesses, who were very shook up, called po- lice officials, who went to the scene to investigate. The only evidence was that the weeds leading from the road and into the wooded area where it entered were smashed down. In this case the creature was said to be light brown in color, 7 to 8 foot tall, and having large red eyes.
