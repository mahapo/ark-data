FROM THE EDITOR The sparks are still flying from the NOVA (public television) \"Case of the UFOs\" in October, a purported documentary which — in the view of many of us — was totally one-sided. Several items in this issue address aspects of the production, and they are not likely to be the \"last word.\" The issues raised by the NOVA treatment of the subject are fundamental: the state of journalism, fairplay, objectivity, public education, the popular \"image\" of UFOs, and what constitutes science vis-a-vis UFOs, among others. All these are deserving of discussion.

Johnson (MUFON State Section Director) Pat Clausing of Maple Valley was driving southwest on Hwy. 18 at 6 p.m. on August 11, 1982, between Maple Valley and Auburn when he saw what he first thought was a hot air balloon. However, the object he was watching was not \"gondola\" shaped and did not have the \"personality\" of a hot air balloon. Its course appeared to be too stable and it appeared to have more control over where it was going. He finally decided that what he was watching must be a UFO. He temporarily lost sight of the UFO when he came down around a curve and when he saw it again he got close enough to get a good description. He felt that he was very close — about an eighth of a mile away from the object, which appeared to be 100-150 feet above the treetops. Mr. Clausing described the object as \"donut shaped,\" but without a hole in the center, with \"no windows, antenna, or landing gear\" (see sketch). When asked if it was kind of lozenge shaped he replied \"yes.\" The object was estimated to be 100 feet in diameter. There are numerous high-tension power lines in the area and a large Bonneville Power Authority substation nearby. The object was traveling in approximately the same direction he was — toward Auburn. It followed the curvature of the land as it went. When he first sighted the object he had the impression it was either hovering or going very slow. When he lost sight of the object it had accelerated to the speed of a jet, perhaps 300 miles per hour. The witness sped up to 75 m.p.h. in hopes of catching sight of the object but did not see it again. He felt that from beginning to end the entire sighting lasted 2 to 3 minutes. Mr. Clausing reports that there were other cars on the highway but none had slowed down to watch and he couldn't be sure if any of the other drivers saw what he did. He thought August 11,1982 Maple Valley, Wash. about flagging one down but decided that because he was on a two-lane limited access highway and because of the speed the cars were going it would have been too dangerous. When he got home he telephoned his brother to tell him what happened. This sighting occurred the day after another sighting, made by the Hanson family only a few miles away to the southeast. Steve and Bonnie Hanson and their 6-year-old son had left a relative's home in Black Diamond about 10:30 the evening of August 10th, on their way home to Kent. They were approaching a local trout farm just to the north of Lake Sawyer when they all saw a bright light in the sky at the same time. The light was above the treeline, off in the sky, and it was projecting a beam of light into the sky, moving it back and forth like a searchlight. The object had four red lights arranged in a pattern, and the young boy reported seeing four more red lights in a smaller pattern above the first four, although neither of the parents could confirm this. They estimated it might be about 2 miles away (although they admitted they really did not have any good way of telling the distance.) They came to a stop sign that was located underneath one of the many power lines in the area and watched as the object continued to move off. At this point the pattern of the searchlight changed^The beam of light that had been directed up in the sky quit and a new light beam began rotating down around the object. It appeared to Bonnie that the object was coming back toward them. She decided that it would be better if they left and asked her husband to please go. Her husband, who was driving, said he wanted to stay a little longer, but after a short while he did agree to go. Just as he put the car in motion and turned right around the corner a bright beam of light shone down into the car, bathing the driver in red light. When they looked again the object was gone. The entire incident was estimated to have lasted 3 minutes. When they got home they called their relative back in Black Diamond to report what they saw. The next day they called the UFO Reporting Center in Seattle. On Friday, August 13th, three days after the Hanson family sighting and two days after the Clausing sighting, a Tacoma woman who wishes to remain anonymous videotaped four frames of something she thought was a UFO while preparing a videotape for professional production. What follows is a brief summary of . our initial investigation and a narrative by the witness. The woman was filming a panoramic shot of the city of Tacoma from a hill near a restaurant that overlooks the city about a mile and a half away. The time was about 10:45 in the morning, and the camera was mounted on a tripod, pointed almost due north. The object on videotape appears as a dark cloud, somewhat lens shaped, with a possible dome or protuberance on the top (see photo).

Perhaps the main opposing viewpoint has been that the driver himself, in his panic, stalled/altered the performance of the vehicle. Very little research appears to have been carried out into the subject until the mid 1%0's, with vehicle interference reports being scattered here and there amongst other types of close encounters, in books, magazines, and filing systems. One of the first compilations of such data is to be found in The UFO Evidence, published by NICAP in 1964 which brought together 106 reports, including 45 in which motor vehicles were said to have stalled. Two years later came a challenge to the long held belief in electromagnetic fields being the cause of Vehicle Interference Effects (VIE). Vallee & Vallee in 1966, when discussing secondary effects (traces, VIE cases, etc.) wrote: ....the hypotheses put forward by UFO students are quite inadequate to explain these effects in terms of the UFO \"technology\" they assume. Michel, for instance, has summed up his discussion of the secondary effects by saying that all these effects can be explained by the production of a'suitable magnetic field. 5 (continued on next page) Washington State, Continued Its length is roughly five times its height. The object streaks across the field of view from left to right, appearing in only four frames in a recording made at 30 frames per second. The camera was not being panned at the moment the unexplained object appeared on the film. Witness's statement: I use a Hitachi GP-5 camera with a Sony portable 3/4\" videotape recorder. I was out taking pictures of Tacoma on a hilltop overlooking the Tacoma Dome and the Port of Tacoma at the site of a restaurant. As I was taking a panning shot of the Tacoma Dome I thought I saw a bird interfere with the picture taking. I went ahead and continued on taking pictures. I didn't think anything of it. Later on that afternon while I was reviewing the material on the tape I saw a flash go by and I took another look at the frames going by one at a time. I noticed what looked like a cloud going by on four frames. The more I looked at this cloud it seemed to have a form to it with somewhat of a long trail almost. I called Channel 11 up at first but they weren't able to send a reporter out that day. I called the UFO Reporting Center in Seattle and they said that they would contact me on Monday. Then on Monday I went over to Channel 11 to have them check over the tape I had to see what .they thought it was. One thing that was a little odd: their viewer showed an electrical disturbance everytime the object came on t- ~-~^'- — Videotape picture of UFO-like object, faintly visible here as elongated object in center above skyline (courtesy off Donald A. Johnson) the screen. So it looks like the film is going great but the moment the object is on the screen the electrical disturbance starts and the moment the object is off the screen the electrical disturbance stops. This case is still under investigation, and we will have more news on the results of the film analysis as it becomes available.

That year a more precise suggestion as to the nature of the EM effect was put forward. In her 1966 work, \"Flying Saucers, the Startling Evidence of an Invasion from Outer Space,\" Coral Lorenzen discussed the 1957 Fort Itaipu (Brazil) case, investigated by Dr. O. Fontes. Later, In a paper titled \"UFO weapons — Comments on Technical Aspects Involved,\" Fontes wrote: The evidence at hand indicates that UFOs possess means of creating in the ignition systems of automobile and aircraft internal combustion engines secondary currents powerful enough to destroy the synchronization of spark-plug action and thus stall the engine;....these \"electric effects\" are not merely side effects of the powerful electromagnetic fields that exist around UFOs, but the result of purposeful interference of a weapon used as a means of defense or attack.... Existing evidence suggests that such a weapon is not an alternating magnetic field in itself, but a high frequency, long-range electromagnetic beam of some sort, i.e. a radio-electric wave concentrated into a narrow powerful beam. After a careful analysis of the data I came to the conclusion that this weapon might be a microwave ionizer.... 2 In short, Fontes proposed the cause of a VIE event was in fact a weapon generating microwaves, which ionized the air, causing a short between the terminals of a battery thus bringing on the effects. Older ideas were, however, still very much alive and kicking in 1967, as evidenced by Otto Binder in \"What We Really Know About Flying Saucers,\" when he wrote a chapter headed \"Electromagnetic Wizardry.\" Recounting the 26 Oct. 1958 Loch Raven Dam incident he commented: This is one example of another pattern displayed by the UFOs — the widely reported phenomena of electromagnetic effects when a flying saucer is nearby. Some sort of field of energy, probably related to the ship's propulsion, seems to surround UFOs with effects that are various and startling: killing car motors....\" 3 A new suggestion as to the cause of VIE events came forward in 1968. Philip J. Klass, in a general overview of the UFO phenomena, proposed that natural atmospheric plasma was the cause of a multitude of UFO events. At one stage he stated: ....because a plasma contains a cloud of electrified particles, there is no doubt that if an auto battery were enveloped by such a plasma the battery could be short circuited. 4 However, this explanation was challenged by Dr. James E. McDonald who pointed out that Klass' suggestion as to how plasma ions could get inside the bonnet (hood) of a car by \"mirror- images\" was totally incorrect. The idea was easily dismissed according to McDonald. 5 The study of the subject of UFOs undertaken by the University of Colorado has received a tremendous amount of criticism since its report was released. However, they did come up with a way to improve the quality of vehicle interference research, in 1968. Chapter 4 of section 3 of the report was written by Roy Craig, an associate professor and co-ordinator of physical sciences at the University, and titled \"Indirect physical evidence.\" While commenting on the fact that some UFOs reportedly stopped cars and others did not, he added: ....strange animal reactions, and even interference with telephone operation, have been claimed in cases in which the UFO was later identified as a bird or a plastic balloon. 6 Discussion ensued on testing an hypothesis that motors are stopped or interfered with by magnetic fields associated with UFOs. Experiments were conducted and results showed that an ignition coil in a steel container would continue to operate in magnetic fields of less than 20 Kg. Coupled with the protection of the bonnet and body of a car, far higher fields would be needed to stall an engine. Further experimental work included the examination of the magnetic signature of a vehicle which the driver claimed had been near a UFO. The test showed no change when compared with a control vehicle, implying that the vehicle had not been exposed to a high intensity magnetic field. Meanwhile, Coral and Jim Lorenzen were posing questions: There is considerable dispute about just what causes these mechanical failures of vehicles because we actually know so very little about UFOs themselves. But, on the other hand, we do know, in the context of earth technology, that a rapidly varying magnetic field can create secondary currents powerful enough to disrupt the synchronization of the sparking action. Could this result from the power, so to speak, used by UFOs? 7 Later they added: Whatever the UFOs use to stall engines, it is not effective when used on diesels or steam engines (there have been several incidents of UFOs \"buzzing\" trains). It does not seem that the UFOs involved in these EM cases are using a defensive system, for they invariably make their approach at their own discretion, and therefore are not defending themselves against anything. Nor is there any indication that the device used to stall cars....is a purely accidental byproduct of the propulsion system of the UFO....There is one possible answer if the UFOs are real machines. The occupants may desire to disable the subject of their scrutiny in order to make a leisurely study.... 7 Research then seemed to take a back seat between 1969 and 1976. It wasn't until the latter date that James McCampbell presented some new ideas. In a book, UFO/ogy, while discussing electrical interference he states: The implication is clear: the mechanism of UFO interference is something other than low frequency, electromagnetic radiation. 8 Elaborating on this with internal combustion engines, McCampbell concludes that: The only way to stop a running engine, therefore, is to disrupt the electrical system. Thus the influence of UFOs upon automobiles is most assuredly electrical or electromagnetic in nature.... (continued on next page) 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Vehicle E-M, Continued Going on to discuss the Condon committee's investigation he notes: Instead of focusing exclusively upon strong magnetic fields, the investigation should have encompassed fluctuating electromagnetic fields that could have effects upon engines, radios and headlamps without altering the magnetic signature of the car body. This approach was suggested by David. R. Saunders who held a key position on the project. High frequency electromagnetic radiation is an excellent candidate for the cause of UFO interference with cars. 8 McCampbell also presented a paper at the 1976 Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) conference under the title, \"UFO interference with automobile electrical systems, part 1, headlights.\" 9 In the paper McCampbell noted that during the 1954 French wave and the U.S. 1957 Levelland, Texas, episodes, the UFO was reported to be in front of the vehicle. This led him to propose the idea that the headlamp reflector was perhaps acting as a receiving dish for microwave energy. This idea was further expanded on at ,the 1977 MUFON symposium and documented in the proceedings of that meeting. 10 The paper here explored the possibility of radiation causing engine failure by a UFO in front of the vehicle. Verification of the fact that the vehicle failures have a directional sensitivity followed from a survey by Mark Rodeghier of CUFOS, who showed that the typical event, in 357 cases, involved a UFO descending in front of the vehicle. Another case, in short, totally worthless from the point of view of scientific inquiry. Again, a single witness (suspect at that) sighting and no confirmatory evidence whatever.\" This is how Donald Menzel and Ernest Taves, in 1977, dismissed case 12 on the Condon report. The case was one where a lady reported observing a luminous object following her car with mechanical and electrical functions impaired. Their conclusion was based on the fact that the lady was a \"repeater,\" the account had discrepancies and that the examination 6 of the vehicle by the manufacturer disclosed all malfunctions (except a broken radio antenna) were the results of wear and tear. Later they demolished Condon case 17, describing a youth reporting a large glowing object affecting his car, by stating: Here we have yet another case of a single observer report with no supporting evidence. The magnetization pattern of the automobile was checked and found to be normal. The engine was found to be badly out of tune, but no physical evidence could be found that was related to the sighting. 11 Case 39 likewise fell to their combined talents. It would seem from their treatment of these three cases that they had little time for single witness reports. Following the lead of investigators and researchers such as McCampbell, 1979 brought the beginning of serious research, and the gathering of basic data on our topic of interest. The British UFO Research Association (BUFORA) in the UK published a 102-page report 12 presenting summaries of 424 vehicle (motor, aircraft, and boats) events. Besides this essential catalgue was an indepth examination of two 1968 UK cases. One was of a man driving a car when a small golden object, moving at high speed and visible for only two seconds, passed by. The car's headlights failed, the radio fell silent, the engine stopped, and the vehicle came to a halt. After the object had gone, the headlights relit and he was able to restart the motor. However, the radio remained inoperative. Fortunately, the radio was examined and an analysis prepared and given in the report. By comparison there is recounted an incident in which three separate vehicles reportedly experienced a simultaneous electrical systems breakdown. The reported effects included: Car 1 — no current across the battery terminals, stone cold radiator, speedometer jammed on 30 m.p.h., interior thermometer showing zero, car' clock stopped. Car 2 — car-mounted compass spinning wildly, stopped clock, zero battery current. Car 3 — no battery current, stopped clock. To top it all off, car 1's key wouldn't open the boot! Half an hour later their lights came back on, the drivers could start their engines and proceed. The most important point to note here is that at no stage was a UFO seen. BUFORA also attempted a few statistical extractions related to percentage of engine malfunctions, lights, humanoids, and physiological effects. Finally a discussion by a project team was given. They explored \"engine malfunctions,\" \"failure of lights,\" and \"mechanical trouble.\" Their suggested recommendations for the future included: *Expand analysis of the most interesting cases. *Look for cases earlier than 1945 (aircraft). *Experiment to try and reproduce effects. *Use of a questionnaire to gather basic facts. Jenny Randies and Peter Warrington in their book, UFOs: a British viewpoint after discussing an example of a VIE event wrote: We can of course postulate some kind of electromagnetic field — but it is of interest to note that examinations of vehicles involved in cases such as these do not usually reveal the tell-tale signs of being subject to a field strength which would be capable of causing the ignition to fail....Are we therefore to believe that this whole thing is again subjective? Could it be that the car is stopped by relatively normal means? In other words, the UFO experience creates a particular atmosphere around the witnesses which causes them to stop the car — although they quite possibly are not aware of doing so nor of making futile attempts to re-start it. 13 They go on later to say: Whatever causes the UFO event in some way causes the electromagnetic effects. Then they point out that not all close encounters with vehicles result in effects — why? Their suggestion was to look perhaps towards the emotional state of one of the percipients. Later they recounted Professor John Taylor's analysis of apparent (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Vehicle E-M, Continued parapsychological effects and suggest that perhaps the witnesses create the effects themselves. Quite a different approach to the early days of metallic discs beaming vehicles to a halt. In an entry in the 1980 Encyclopedia of UFOs, 14 Stanton T. Friedman, under the heading \"Electromagnetic Effects of UFOs,\" in summing up why all UFOs do not manifest EM effects suggests several possible factors: *Effects may depend on distance. *Occupants of UFOs might be testing devices capable of affecting vehicles. *One might need a certain type of object in a certain proximity to a certain type of UFO. He also stated a need for greater data collection and attempts at duplication of effects in laboratories. 1981 saw the publication of a joint catalogue and analysis by Mark Rodeghier which to date has been the best overall contribution to the subject under study. In his introductory remarks he stated, as have so-many before him: However, I soon discovered that the data that has (sic) been collected about the vehicles involved has (sic) been, to put it charitably, somewhat skimpy for all but a few well documented cases. 15 Rodeghier presented a catalogue of 441 events which involved land vehicles, together with sources, before proceeding to look at the data. Thorough analyses of a variety of parameters; date, time, duration, size, witnesses, etc., are given. Finally he looked at patterns analysis. Thirty five spearate statistically significant correlations were found, with clusters of interesting factors (e.g. the presence of a light beam, control of a vehicle, a physiological effect, or the chasing of a vehicle). In summarizing his thoughts about the clusters, he commented: (1) It is unlikely that a natural phenomena (sic) would suddenly begin occurring with some frequency after 1953, when many vehicles had been on the road for dozens of years before that date. (2) A natural phenomena would probably not occur preferentially in unpopulated areas. (3) There is no ready explanation for the avoidance of the daylight hours by EM events... (4) No relationship was demonstrated between severity of EM effects and distance to the UFO, unexpected for a natural phenomena. (5) The presence of humanoids in several events is an obvious difficulty. (6) While a spinning plasma might appear metallic to an individual under certain lighting conditions, it is unlikely that so many witnesses have been unable to determine the true appearance of the phenomenon....These considerations, in conjunction with the existence of two strongly correlated, groups of characteristics, argue powerfully against the hypothesis that all EM events are due to unknown natural phenomena. 15 1981 seemed the year for the commencement of more rigorous examination of the available data. Donald A. Johnson presented a paper to the second CUFOS conference held in Chicago in September of that year. He chose 78 cases which provided details of size, distance, and duration information and analyzed them. Seven clusters of information were found. \"The incomplete ignition interference cases were found predominantly in two clusters, both representing encounters with small objects of brief duration. One cluster in which all encounters resulted in stalled vehicles identified cases of high strangeness (occupant and contact reports).\" 16 The most recent study to come to my attention is a currently unpublished one (1982) conducted by Patricia McMahon 17 of the USA who looked for patterns in VIE events. She reiterates a call for better data gathering. From our review we can see that there have been a multitude of explanations put forward to explain VIE events. A partial listing might read as follows: • Hoax • Witness panics • Psychological • Intenal stimuli not yet understood (parapsychological) • External stimuli — natural • External stimuli — the UFO phenomena However, and most importantly in my opinion, as pointed out by the .Vallee's (1966), BUFORA (1979), Friedman (1980), Rodeghier (1981), and McMahon (1982), the vital thing we still lack is hard data, available to us all. Only a relatively few cases detail exactly what the witnesses did to the vehicle (e.g., did they brake, declutch etc.), what the exact effects were (e.g., did the oil and ignition lights come on when it stalled), and exactly how did the event end (e.g., how did the engine restart). It appears to me that although pioneering efforts have been made to gather some data, we have insufficient good hard data to hand to really evaluate much more than has been achieved until now. The remedy is threefold. Firstly, a call to all investigators to comb their files for past VIE cases and ensure they are published. Secondly, for all future events to be carefully investigated, documented and published in full. Thirdly, there is a crying need for someone, or a group of people, to start looking indepth at these cases. They represent a subgroup of reports from which we should be able to retrieve a vast amount of material. If there are any takers for initiating such a study group, either within an organization or just as a loose network of researchers, this author would be interested in joining in.

The skin bum gives a further clue to the energy of the emitted radiation. For a surface burn to be observed on a person at the distance of 175 feet, the radiation might have been in the spectra of ultraviolet to the soft x-ray region. In this region, the principal radiation interaction is the photoelectric effect which produced the observed burn as well as the sensation of heat. From the physiological injuries and observed skin bum, it is apparent that a delivered exposure of between 200-300 rem occurred in the observation period of not greater than ten minutes. From this data, the power of the emission can be calculated. For the calculation, it was assumed that the distance from the object was 175 feet and the exposure rate was 1200 rem/hr for a ten-minute period. To further simplify the calculation, it is further assumed that a monoenergetic gamma/X-ray of 50 kev was emitted from an isotropic point source. Working backward to the source of the total gamma/X-ray emission, total power could be obtained. The total gamma/X-ray power appears to be around 50 kw. The amount of power emitted in this fashion can give insight to the possible source of power employed. Several man-made devices will emit radiation in this range and power. These are 1. an unshielded atomic pile; 2. particle accelerators; 3. X-ray devices. It is possible that the device observed was a military test platform. If this was the case, several types of devices could cause the observed effects such as a nuclear reactor or a large scale magnetohydrodynamic propulsion device. In either case, these devices would require massive shielding (i.e., weight) to make it a manned platform and would therefore most likely dictate that such a test vehicle be remotely piloted for early development. This would require that the pilot be in visual contact with the device, yet maintain sufficient distance to avoid excessive radiation exposure!

Maccabcc, PhD (MUFON Maryland State Director) Transcript of the Statement by Phillip Klass regarding the initial radar detections and reporting of targets by the Wellington Air Traffic Controller during the beginning of the New Zealand sightings (from the NOVA program), followed by John Cordy, an air traffic controller in New Zealand (involved in previous sightings): Klass: No, it's interesting, I think in that connection, to point out that the function of an air traffic controller is to maintain safe separation between an airplane and another aircraft....and yet the Wellington radar traffic controller did not bother, even, to call Captain Startup's plane and say \"I have unknown targets in your vicinity\". He did not do that until Captain Startup called and'said \"I've got a TV camera crew on board....do you have any interesting blips for me?\". And then the traffic controller said \"Oh yes, I have one, I think ten miles to ahead, or five miles.to your left, or six miles to the right,\" and so on. The interesting thing is, if Captain Startup at that point really thought that there was some unknown aircraft in his vicinity or directly ahead of him, he would certainly have said to the controller, \"Please vector me out of the way. If this is a craft, you don't know its identity, if its not operating under your control, vector me around it because I don't want to run the risk of a collision.\" Yet, Captain Startup didn't ask for such directions, nor did the traffic controller volunteer them. And so, based on that, I think, each of them knew that these were simply atmospheric angels, or anomalous blips. Cordy: We have to be rather careful when we do pass odd messages to aircraft because you mustn't distract the pilot from his primary duty, which is flying the aircraft safely. (Editor's Note: Dr. Maccabe's letter is too long and detailed to print in full, including a minute-by-minute reconstruction of the relevant portions of the 1978 New Zealand sightings and communications between the pilot, Capt. William Startup, and air traffic control. The author may be contacted at 10706 Meadowhill Rd., Silver Spring, MD 20901. The following excerpts are an outline of the letter contents.) Dear Phil: I believe that you owe an apology to UFOlogists and to the general public who may have watched the NOVA documentary,. as well as to the pilot, copilot, and air traffic controller who were involved in the New Zealand sightings. (continued on next page) Radiation, Continued Although a true unknown cannot be discounted, it is my opinion that this case is due to a military device not responding to flight control signals and the principals in this case observed the device during the subsequent recovery operation. Comments on Stowe Analysis (Mr. Stowe's analysis was reviewed by Dr. Peter Rank, Madison, Wise., MUFON consultant in Radiology. Excerpts from his review follow.—Ed.) Mr. Stowe is to be congratulated for the depth of his knowledge and the thoroughness of his analysis. Many of the general principles he has enumerated were used by me in evaluating the Cash/Landrum case, only with less precision. I would agree totally with Mr. Stowe's analysis on pages 1 and 2. (The portion published here; the balance consisted of physics and mathematical calculations.—Ed.) Mr. Stowe has made certain assumptions which may or may not be warranted. The first assumption is that the principals in this case suffered total body radiation. This is by no means clear. I do not believe that a general dosage level can be assigned to the Cash/Landrum case. My reasoning is based upon the observation, to the best of my knowledge, that although both women had symptoms of radiation sickness, there were no well documented changes in the blood and the diarrhea reported was not bloody in nature. My analysis assumed that ionizing radiation, exact wavelength undetermined, was responsible for most of the symptoms. We also know that the women had exposure to light as well as to infrared waves. As Mr. Stowe points out, some of the erythema of the skin can be attributed to ultraviolet, and some certainly can be attributed to shorter wavelengths with higher energy and of an ionizing nature. The extent to which microwave radiation was involved is not clear, and I was unable to come to a position with regard to it. The data Mr. Stowe quotes from the Department of Defense are based primarily on the results of total body radiation at Hiroshima, as well as the pioneering research of Dr. Warren Shields, pathologist, who was one of the first investigators into the effects of radiation following World War II. It must be emphasized that our experience with human total body radiation is limited to these wartime episodes, plus a very few radiation accidents at nuclear installations since then. I have no opinion as to the source of the radiation in the Cash/Landrum case, either military or unidentified, but must certainly agree that any of the three possibilities outlined by Mr. Stowe could be likely. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the source of this radiation probably was an instrument that emitted a wide variety of electromagnetic waves. It is therefore misleading to assume that monoenergetic rays of any kind are the principal determinant of the patient's symptoms."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"SOVIET UFO COVER-UP: A RESPONSE By William L. Moore With respect to Jim Oberg's recent article \"The Great Soviet UFO Cover-up\" (MUFON UFO Journal, No. 176 and 177), let's set the record straight. (1) After satisfactorily explaining the Kamennyy UFO as a Soviet rocket launch, Oberg goes on to state: Ironically, Moore boasted that \"Zigel's reports tend to be limited to those UFO cases that have managed to withstand the most rigorous scientific investigation\".... Fact: While Oberg correctly cites my article \"Red Skies: A History of UFOs in Russia\" (UFO Report, June 1980) as the source of this quotation, he has deliberately chosen to quote me out of context to serve his own ends. The truth of the matter is that Moore makes no boasts at all about Zigel's work or his reports, but merely paraphrases a statement made by Professor Aleksander Kazantsev about his \"friend and colleague\" Dr. Zigel to a reporter for the National Enquirer on 6/25/75. My UFO Report article, when taken in context, reads as follows: According to...Prof. A. Kazantsev, Dr. Zigel realized \"...that if one of the sightings he had reported on in his two volumes is established as a fake, it would....destroy all his years of work, because it would be used against him....\" As a result, Dr. Zigel's reports tend to be limited to those UFO cases....(etc.) Since there is no change of paragraph here, it is clear to anyone with even a basic knowledge of English grammar (Oberg included) that the sentence beginning, \"As a result....\" (result of what? — unless in reference to a previously made statement), is only a continuation in paraphrase of the quotation cited in the previous sentence. My \"Red Skies....\" article makes no boasts about anything. It was intended only as a straightforward, unsensational representation of the facts as I knew them \"at the time (Dec. 1979, as I recall). (2) At the end of his article, Oberg concludes, \"(The Moscow) cover-up is aided unwittingly....by the endorse- ments of such data by Hynek, Haines, Moore, and other leading Western UFO experts....\" While I deeply appreciate the categorization (for once, it seems, I'm in good company), I feel that I must again object to Oberg's casual interpretation of the facts. (continued on next page) Open Letter, Continued This apology is for the distortion of the sequence of events at the beginning of the sightings (i.e., just after the plane passed Cape Campbell, or about 12:10 a.m., Dec. 31,1978). As a result of your version of the sequence of events, millions of NOVA viewers now have the impression that (the) pilot called the air traffic controller and asked if there were any blips on his screen because there was a news crew on board the plane. Your distorted version of the sequence \"just happens\" to lend some support to the conclusion you drew, namely that both the pilot and the controller knew at the time that the blips were only a result of weather conditions, yet they did not inform the news crew, but instead allowed the news crew to believe the radar was picking up unknown targets....\"UFOs.\" In other words, your faulty recitation of the event sequence was used by you to imply that the pilot and controller joined in a de facto hoax by not telling the 10 news crew of the \"true\" nature of the radar targets Apparently in the recitation of pseudo-history of the flight you are trying to set a \"tone\" for your comments to follow (about how the pilot didn't think the targets were \"real\" craft since he didn't try to vector the plane away from them)....What is not acceptable is your statement that the controller reported no blips (radar targets-Ed.) until the pilot (a) said there was a TV crew on board and then, (b) asked if there were any \"interesting blips.\" The uninformed listener would assume that you were reciting the actual series of events.in a very even- voiced, accurate manner. And yet the Wellington Air Traffic Control tape proves that this was not the actual sequence of events. (Moreover, I know that you have a copy of the Wellington transcript and have read it, very likely -more than once.)....(At this point, Dr. Maccabee recounts the actual sequence of events and the air-ground communications from the Wellington tape and analyzes them extensively in comparison to Klass's version.—Ed.) To summarize, Phil, I think you should apologize for giving the impression that the captain waited until he told the controller about the TV crew before asking about the presence of radar blips, when in fact the captain did not mention the TV crew until 7 minutes after the initial contact with Wellington. Furthermore, you should apologize for giving the impression that the Wellington controller only reported blips because he had been told there was a TV crew aboard and only because the captain asked. Instead, it can be shown that the controller, after the initial contact, reported several radar targets without being prompted by the captain, and before he (controller) was told about the TV crew....

Moore, 14-years-old, was fishing with friends near Newberry, South Carolina, when he saw a large cigar-shaped UFO land on the water. The sighting took place around 10:30 p.m. on July 15,1981. The weather was excellent, with a clear sky and a temperature of 75 degrees. Carl and his friends had been fishing that day, but with very little luck. They had only a few fish to show for their efforts and were on their cots for a rest. Carl decided to go down to the boat ramp and check his trot lines; so he was alone when he observed the UFO. The UFO was a 30-fobt-long glowing silver-white cigar-shaped thing. It was flying very slowly over the water, perhaps 20-25 m.p.h. He said it slowly settled on the surface of the water causing steam to rise around it. After about 3 minutes it rose slightly and hovered about one foot above the surface. Suddenly, it shot skyward, UFO hovered over water rising vertically until it was out of sight. Carl described the speed as \"faaast!,\" claiming the UFO went from the hovering position to more than 250 m.p.h. in an instant. The UFO was larger than a standard-sized automobile, without windows or doors. It was covered with small whitish-blue lights. These lights kept flickering back and forth as long as the object was in sight. When the UFO landed on the surface of the water it was less than 50 feet from Carl. Carl described his feelings during the sighting as \"quite disturbed,\" but he was able to \"keep his cool\" and observe the whole event. Because his friends were asleep on their cots, he felt that no one would believe his experience; but when he heard about Project VISIT in Friendswood, Texas, he felt compelled to make a report.D Moore Response, Continued Unless \"report\" and \"endorse\" are synonymous, I have never \"endorsed\" any Soviet UFO data. I am merely guilty of having reported on it in a single unpretentious article written three years ago without (I might add) benefit of knowing that the pentagon \"FOBS Report\" cited by Oberg even existed. (Somehow I suspect that at the time my article was published, Oberg didn't know such a report existed either; otherwise he would have commenced his hand-waving, finger-pointing exercise long before this.) (3) I have noted in the past that Mr. Oberg is quick to take other UFOlogists to task for failure to adequately cite souces of data. Yet when it comes his turn to cite his own apparently numerous sources of Soviet missile/UFO and other data, there is a distinct scarcity of footnotes. I am aware of Jim's steadfast maintenance that he is not an active part of the American intelligence community, yet he has consistently demonstrated an access to information (in many cases Soviet) which is not generally available to the rest of us. I for one call upon him to end the \"cover-up\" and provide us with a list of his sources so that we can more adequately check the reliability of his data and interpretations. After all, if he can so easily misquote me, who knows what he's doing in other cases. (4) Finally, Oberg takes CUFOs to task for allegedly violating \"international copyright law\" by offering for sale a reprint of the Soviet \"Gindilis Report\" without a certify(|ng) copyright before publishing.\" According to Oberg, CUFOS, by so doing, had \"open(ed) themselves to the possibility of a lawsuit from the Soviet government\". All of this would appear at first glance to be a statement of authority, yet as far as I am able to determine, Oberg doesn't know what he's talking about. In the first instance, I am unable to discover any source that lists the Soviet Union as a member of the International Copyright Union; which means that we are not bound to honor their copyrights, nor they ours, except as expressly outlined in any separate bilateral treaty which may exist between the two nations. In the second instance, there appear to be only two such treaties currently in effect (TIAS 8570 and TIAS 9205), both of which are vaguely worded and neither of which would appear to deal directly with the matter at hand. Again, what we seem to have here is yet another example of Mr. Oberg's well-known penchant for making pronouncements from on high without bothering to first check his facts.D 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Case of the UFOs NOVA : REVIEW Illustrations by Mark Fisher \"The Case of the UFOs,\" co- produced for NOVA by WGBH Boston and the BBC London. On October 12, 1982, the Public Broadcasting System featured UFOs as their topic on NOVA, a popular science documentary series. Although the show was well done, a great deal of positive data was discouragingly absent, whereby some of the participants dominated the program with natural explanations and misinterpretations for most UFO reports. The show's first few minutes were exciting, showing footage of a speeding UFO leaving a contrail near Luke Air Force Base, Arizona in 1953. An instructor on a weapons practice mission filmed the event, gave chase, and even fired his guns at it. In 1953, not many aircraft were capable of moving at 400 m.p.h. at an altitude of 30,000 feet. The report was filed with Project Bluebook, and is still listed as \"unknown.\" The first \"UFO expert\" to appear was none other than Philip Klass, an aviation journalist whose negative books on UFOs are well known to the UFO community. Klass explained how the Soviet Union could exploit misinterpreted UFOs here, in the event they launch a surprise attack on the United States. Next came Allan Hendry, a UFO investigator for the Center of UFO Studies, who reported his favorite 12 Venus story when that planet was mistaken for a UFO. Venus is responsible for many UFO sightings, reports NASA engineer James Oberg, who gave examples of how astronauts (in particular, Michael Collins) and a train conductor had mistaken Venus for a UFO. Allan Hendry demonstrated to the viewers-an excellent visual display of how a flying advertising plane with lights strung underneath the wings at night, looks remarkably like a circular flying saucer. Next, NOVA exposed a case that should have embarrassed UFO researchers around the world. In 1970, David Simpson, a physicist from the National Physical Laboratory in England, deliberately engineered a UFO hoax, and had pictures taken to see how the UFO community would respond and interpret his photographic evidence. Many UFO experts ' considered his photos genuine, even though Simpson built flaws into the shots. Simpson's two and a half year experiment was conducted to demonstrate the lack of rigor UFO investigators have in their approach to UFO reports. Today, it is much harder to fake UFO photographs, thanks, to Bill Spaulding's Ground Saucer Watch, which analyzes UFO pictures using computer enhancement techniques. Spauldirig reported that of the 1,100 motion pictures and photos examined, they found 46 or 4% of the pictures to represent structured objects. In my opinion, NOVA could have enhanced their program by showing us some of Spaulding's valid photographic evidence. But instead, producer John Groom continued rehashing fake or misinterpreted UFO pictures. With the help of James Oberg, astronaut sightings are .explained as being anything from fallen boosters to space debris; The balance of the NOVA presentation concerned itself with three UFO encounters. Although I realize a limited amount of funds and resources are allocated for each NOVA program, it is obvious some of the best evidence for the reality of the UFO phenomena was completely ignored. Strong reports like the Kinross case, Iranian case, Michalak case, Coyne- Helicopter case, and Ubatuba case all were overlooked, while weaker cases are presented. Most of the reports that are delved into in detail fit neatly into a theory a scientist on the program was trying to promote. A good example is the first case involving Police Deputy Va Johnson of Oslo, Minnesota. While on night patrol in his car, Johnson observed a lighted object zoom towards him, and he blacked out. When he came to, his car's top was dented, headlights were smashed, windshield shattered and „ antenna was bent. What may have caused this occurrence is explained by Professor Michael Persinger, a ; neurobiologist from the Laurentian | University in Sudbury, Canada. According to Persinger, there is a correlation between balls of light moving erratically near fault line areas and earthquake activity. The presumed mechanism for this phenomenon is that stress in the rocks produce electrically charged ionized gases that appear as unidentified balls of light. Since Johnson was driving near a geologic fault, Persinger claims a luminous display caused the accident. No one can doubt that balls of light can be produced in this way. Visual experiments on NOVA conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Mines proved that fact. But someone should have asked Persinger why UFOs are reported in all sections of the earth, and not simply in areas of geological turmoil. Also, the theory fails to explain why many witnesses report seeing structured, . metallic objects, and not just balls of light bouncing around the sky. NOVA's second UFO case , involved Travis Walton, who allegedly ! was struck by a beam of light from a lighted UFO above, and claims he was abducted by alien creatures and returned four days later. The details of this 1975 encounter are well documented in UFO literature. But Persinger claims he has a solution to the Walton case. He claims Walton wandered too close to a luminous display, and there was a discharge that struck him. What caused Walton to believe he was abducted is that near approaches to these geological balls of (confirmed on nexf page,)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ROBERT SCHEAFFER: \"UFOLOGIST By Virgil Staff Robert Scheaffer (author. of the skeptical book The UFO Verdict—Ed.) was host to the Jim Eason show on the afternoon of January 26, 1982. Eason has a talk show on KGO, San Francisco, and provides opportunity for the airing of various conventional and nonconventional views. James Arthur Hasten, of Berkeley, tape recorded the show, and since — until recently — there has been a paucity of data for evaluating the work of Mr. Scheaffer, there may be interest in the views expressed at that time. Scheaffer tells us he is a UFOlogist \"to the extent that anyone is.\" He grew up interested in UFOs, but when he reached maturity, there was a revulsion to what he had read. \"I sort of felt like I'd been had. . . .1 guess I'm the kind of person who just can't sit back and watch nonsense being paraded loudly and trumpeted like it were truth.\" When asked the reason for writing his book, Scheaffer retorted: \"When I see what appears to be blatant nonsense, masquerading as fact, which unfortunately seems to be the case most of the time, I'm the kind of person who likes to set the record straight.\" Scheaffer tells us he would like to believe there is something out there, \"but that is why we have science fiction.\" What people see are natural phenomena, advertising planes, stars, etc. Those who are not hoaxers are confused. \"The human eye and human mind is not a precision recording device, and people are prone to frequent misperceptions and errors of observation. And its not just uneducated, untrained people. . . .Scientists, pilots, anyone is fallible.\" Scheaffer gives no credence to the photographs so far taken, and he informs us that every one was taken by NOVA Review, Continued .light stimulates the hippocampus in the human brain, in this case causing Walton to hallucinate a fantasy UFO abduction. Persinger may think the Walton case fits his model, but I believe one must strain his imagination to think this hypothesis is a solution to the UFO mystery. Although some UFO reports could be explained as ionized balls of light, many more cannot. The final part of NOVA's program was devoted to a number of UFO sightings over New Zealand between December 21 and 31,1978. In this case, a simultaneous radar-visual- photographic observation was made, documented by pilots in separate aircraft, radar operators, and on December 31 was even filmed by a professional television cameraman. Much debate over what the image is on the film continues. Optical physicist Bruce Maccabee feels the New Zealand film is unexplainable in ordinary terms. However, a skeptical atmospheric physicist named Bill Ireland said the UFOs filmed that night were nothing extraordinary, and were probably nothing more than city lights, a lighted squid boat, or lighthouse. At the end of the show the producers gave Klass, Hendry, and Oberg a chance to reflect on the probably natural explanations for the UFO mystery. Although the narrator says UFOs exist, a better understanding of the scientific process and the needs of the mind are required before we will be able to discover the key to UFOs. In my opinion, the program was certainly interesting, however, it seemed slanted towards putting UFOs in a negative light. A more balanced program might have included a Stan Friedman or J. Allen Hynek to present a stronger case for the phenomenon. — T. Scott Grain, Jr. only one single photographer. With the multitude of cameras around, why was there never more than one photographer involved? \"If something real were up there, and it were as real as a 747, we would have so many clear, undisputable photographs of it, given the number of cameras in the world.\" As to the usefulness of what he calls \"blobs\" and \"blurs,\" these are surely of no account. \"If the UFOs are here-and they have been flying over New York City, and Chicago, and Los Angeles, and any other major city you'd care to name\" then \"the worst part of it is that they've been getting away with it all these years. That's the part I can't explain. If they're here, and if they're doing all these things, by golly, we would have caught them, and not just one. We would have caught them many times over—If they don't want to be seen, they should stay away from New York City.\" Pascagoula (1973 abduction report by Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker—Ed.) was undoubtedly staged, and Scheaffer uses Phil Klass as his source. Nick Mariana's 16-mm movie at Great Falls, Montana, (1950) is most likely of two airplanes. While what Jimmy Carter witnessed subtended a visual angle like unto a full moon, Scheaffer tells us that Carter saw Venus. Upon being queried as to what might alter his views, he tells us: \"If a UFO lands in Times Square — it doesn't even have to be that dramatic — if a UFO tomorrow were to fly over New York City and be seen by 50,000 people, and be photographed by 200 of them, I would be pretty sorely pressed to explain something like that.\" By this writer's count, six individuals telephoned the program to speak with the host.

This individual, and two others, had witnessed an unusual phenomenon in the 1950's, and the same had been reported by numerous other witnesses around the area. Scheaffer obviously did not wish to talk with this man, and the caller was twice interrupted in his statements. When the caller attempted to report his experience, Scheaffer retorted: \"This is your memory, approximately 30 years later, of what you recall the object as looking like. I can cite any number of studies saying that any group of people, or any individual regardless of how well educated, or how sober and sane, can be seriously mistaken in perceptions of-this kind. We can cite papers from Scientific American and all kinds of other places where these experiments have been done. What you're describing is your recollection — your mind's reconstruction of what you think you saw. But unfortunately what you actually saw, we have no way of getting at because nobody has any photographs or any other instrument- ation of any kind. ...\" When the caller obviously wanted to relate his sighting, Scheaffer interrupted to say: \"I don't have any star tables with me and you probably don't know the date, the time, and we don't know what the airline flights were like.\" As if the presence or absence of any of these necessarily made any difference. Scheaffer apparently requires time to: (1) cull but the incidents he can't immediately handle; and (2) prepare comments that will cause the interpretation of the phenomenon to appear silly. In two instances, Scheaffer refers to \"little green men,\" and he attempts to make UFOlogy appear ridiculous by reference to items such as \"the little dome on the top, you know that kind of stuff — the little man leaning out the window and waving.\" It is this writer's conclusion that Scheaffer resorts to lightweight humor and ridicule to produce his stereotype of UFOlogy. His so-called skepticism of the phenomenon is untrustworty since it smacks more of doctrinal than of the 14 mefhodo/ogica/ variety. His habits of thought appear rigid rather than differentiated, and he employs symbols, unacceptable to most UFOlogists, in order to cause UFOlogists to appear discredited. The great mass of evidence is ignored, and while he is flippant about the investigative evidence, his recognition of sensory cues is highly arbitrary and selective. Scheaffer alleges an attempt to be scientific, but his criticism is nurtured in views currently in vogue among the debunkers, and not on the particulars of reported events. The degree to which such assertions are intellectually bankrupt can be seen in the observation that should such an event be witnessed in Scheaffer's own back yard, such event would not be recognizable. In Scheaffer's mind, there is an answer even prior to the event. In his search after verification, Scheaffer employs the academic research findings of experimental psychologists to cause it to appear that he who was not there may explain what was experienced by the witnesses who were. All witnesses — credible and otherwise — are lumped together, and what these believe they have seen is secondary in importance to interpretations of distant academics who have produced materials relating to the commonly known tricks played on us by our perceptual equipment. This is a simplistic and pompous approach to the interpretation of any phenomenon, and while it adapts to the prevailing temper of the official ideology, one would seem forced to conclude that it is of little circumstance in aiding in the explanation of such phenomena. Since Scheaffer has shown no legitimacy to his allegations, it can be concluded that his views possess little utility. That is, they provide no evidence of being based on rational doubt. His views are undoubtedly aimed not at those familiar with the literature, but at the great mass of those who are not. Scheaffer selects, accentuates, and interprets, but he goes beyond the evidence. In Scheaffer's statements, there are no alternatives to his beliefs.

Allen Hynek are featured in 'i the September Journal; the meeting of the local MUFON group near where I live seethes with criticism of the program's skeptical viewpoint. I think the entire episode provides an excellent opportunity for the UFO movement to review its public relations situation. A fundamental rule to keep in mind is that you cannot tell people just what you want them to believe: you must modify your message to the limits of (1) what the audience will accept, and (2) what the communication medium will permit. Many years ago when I was in newspaper work, I though that \"news\" was something out there, with the newspapers' task being to collect that \"news\" for the convenience of the readers, and in as \"objective\" and \"fair\" manner as possible. But over the years I have come to realize that the volume of \"news\" is so huge that the media's task r is more one of selection rather than collection, and the complexity of that \"news\" is so involved that the media must organize the selection to what people are able and willing to understand. Look at the situation now from the standpoint of the director of the NOVA show. You are asked to put together a show about UFOs, and you know little about them. What should you do? Ideally, you would plunge into extensive research about UFOs, and determine an \"objective\" point of view to serve as the focus of your program. As a practical matter, however, the available information about UFOs is so extensive, complex, and partly contradictory, that you despair of developing your own \"handle\" on the subject which will turn this mass of information into an understandable \"package\" for the average viewer. Furthermore, NOVA is a science program, so you want your show suitably scientific. So, you might well turn to a sensible scientific observer of the UFO situation to suggest a list of people to contact and to film for possible use on your show. Andrus reports in his letter/article that Kendrick Frazier, editor of the Skeptical Inquirer, the publication of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), provided such a list for the program's producer. (Incidentally, I found it curious that Andrus considered Frazier \"biased\"; actually, we are all biased in favor of our own point of view, and I would interpret Andrus as objecting to a program biased in favor of the CSICOP point of view rather than biased in favor of the MUFON point of view.) Ideally, of course, one might hope for an \"objective\" point of view, but I regard that as virtually if not entirely impossible given (1) the complexities of the UFO situation and (2) the widely- differing attitudes among the potential audience of the program. The advantage of the CSICOP point of view is that it \"hangs together,\" it is consistent, it \"makes sense\" — all from the standpoint of the average viewer who knows little about UFOs. Supposing that the NOVA producer had instead turned to Andrus or Hynek for a list of recommended subjects for a UFO program. Presumably they would have provided a list that reflected more the great variety of materials and views in the UFO field — a complex array of ideas including (as Hynek suggests in his editorial) \"E-M cases, animal cases, Close Encounters of the First Kind (and others) which have defied rational explanation,\" plus the extra-terrestrial theory, the \"abduction\" claims, and other aspects of the current UFO situation. The problem with such a program is, first, it would be difficult to get all that material into a one-hour program. Second, it would leave the average viewer quite confused, since it would have no single clear focus or point of view to bring it all together. Check any NOVA program, or for that matter any TV documentary, and I think you will find a simple coherent theme, one that you could summarize in the proverbial nutshell of 25 words or less. Also, this UFO TV documentary must cope with an audience whose knowledge and experiences and top-of- their-head impressions of the subject are so varied. A TV documentary on, say, the Tylenol poisoning scare would reach an audience with basically similar background: we've all heard about the situation, we all regard it as deplorable, and we all agree that something should be done to prevent a recurrence. But a TV documentary on UFO's will be viewed by a widely-fractured audience including people who have seen UFOs, people who believe everything they read about UFOs in the National Enquirer, people who dismiss the UFO movement as a bunch of kooks who believe in little green men from Mars, and people who regard UFOs as sinister, or amusing, or silly, or irrelevant. Television, even more than the print media, demands a clear-cut unity of approach designed for and understandable to the mass audience. How, then, could the UFO scene be handled as a TV documentary? Not easily, unless you adopt a simple and specific point of view, such as CSICOP's. I would think the primary point of the UFO scene is its diversity — which is difficult to portray clearly in (continued on next page) 10"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"1982 UFO SUMMIT CONFERENCE By Walt Andrus The enthusiasm and willingness to take positive steps'to secure maximum cooperation in UFOlogy in North America by representatives attending this history-making event exceeded everyone's expectations. We want to acknowledge the fact that both Peter Mazzola and Mrs. Barbara Schutte had previously proposed the need for such a top level conference. The 1982 MUFON UFO Symposium in Toronto on July 2, 3, and 4 became the ideal vehicle to bring the leaders of the various UFO organizations together for the July 5th meeting at the Westbury Hotel, hosted by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. Speakers for the morning session and their subjects were Walter H. Andrus, Jr. (Moderator) (MUFON), \"Cooperation, Sharing, and Establishing UFOlogy as a Science through Professionalism in Investigation and Research\"; J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D. (CUFOS), \"The Role that the Center for UFO Studies Will Play in the Global Scene\"; William L. Moore (APRO), \"APRO's Position with Respect to Worldwide Cooperation in UFOlogy\"; Sherman J.

(Sweden) \"Ufology- What Next?\"; Paul Norman (VUFORS), \"How Cooperation in Ufology was Accomplished in Critic's Corner, Continued one hour. Plus the problem of making sense both to viewers of the program who read the National Enquirer and those who read the Skeptical Inquirer. And then too there's NOVA's demand to be scientific. Most serious students of UFOs regard what they do as scientific, but the public image is something else. Even CSICOP would agree, I think, that extraterrestrial visitations are possible, although extremely unlikely, but I imagine many scientists would question the \"science\" of a field where a substantial number of people unreservedly embrace the ETH even though there has never been a single acceptable piece of hard evidence to support it. And what of the insistence of many people in the UFO movement that not only are there extraterrestrials buzzing around out there, but that they are invisibly \"abducting\" earth people; these \"abductions\" allegedly have 16 occurred at least 300 times in the last decade or so, yet there is no hard evidence, or even just eyewitness testimony of an \"abduction\" by someone seeing it but not hypnotized or in some other altered state of consciousness. The \"lesson\" of the NOVA program furor, I think, is that (1) the UFO movement consists of individuals with ideas so diverse that it cannot present a single clear viewpoint to the public, and (2) that in any case the public has its own ideas about UFOs and about what sort of evidence might be acceptable. Let's not expect to \"educate\" the general public without hard evidence: if an extraterrestrial spaceship lands and makes itself known, no further proof is needed; without that, no other proof is acceptable. Instead of complaining about the NOVA program, let's concentrate on developing good evidence that a future documentary will want to include. Australia\"; Mrs. John L.

Over 50 people attended the full day conference and participated in the brainstorming style discussion to chart the direction of the proposed federation for North American UFO groups. Since each of the represented organizations had established themselves as entities, it was their unanimous desire to retain their autonomy. With one exception (APRO), they all enthusiastically voted to form a federation to represent all UFO groups, leading to greater cooperation in UFOlogy. In addition to the people who made presentations during the morning session, the following people represented specific UFO groups to the Conference: Rick R. Hilberg, Northern Ohio UFO; Mary Ann Hawk, Cleveland Ufology Project; Mike Bird, UFORCOS (Canada); Elaine Kaiser (SBI); Mrs. Mimi Hynek (CUFOS); William T.

Some of the reasons suggested for forming the federation were elimination of duplicate effort, the future of UFOlogy, to elect delegates to an International Organization, accredit- ation of field investigators, standardization of vocabulary and investigative techniques, a united spokesman for the federation, and basically to resolve the UFO phenomenon. Delegates to P.I.C.U.R. already selected were reaffirmed as id Haisell (UFOCAN), J. Allen ; Hynek (CUFOS), and Michael Sinclair \\ (MUFON). Goals and objectives proposed by the participants for the federation included establishing a vocabulary of UFO definitions, selecting a steering committee, determining authority of the federation, federation structure, preliminary funding, membership assessment, a plan to resolve the UFO phenomenon, tax exempt status, prepare federation bylaws, delegation of authority to federation committees, means of communications to the federation members, laboratories for analysis, investigators list with location and specialization, utilization of computers and software development, field investigator training and certification, an accreditation board, no preconceived doctrines, list of consultants and their areas of expertise, coordination of field investigators, a \"react\" team, a mobile laboratory, and a means of validating ^N our research. j The scope of the federation could ; vary from a loose federation of UFO i organizations in North America to the ultimate—One Worldwide Organi- zation. No attempt was made to select a name, since the scope of the federation must first be determined. A steering committee was selected from the representatives attending the summit conference to meet, develop an organization structure, address the goals and objectives, and communicate this information to participating groups. The steering commitee is composed of Peter Mazzola (SBI), Rick Hilberg (Northern Ohio), Charles Wilhelm (OUFOIL), Walt Andrus (MUFON), Richard F.

The steering committee has been functioning via correspondence and telephone and plans to meet in a centralized location to consolidate a plan of action for the federation when the timing is appropriate. Since the steering committee members are located from Staten Island, N.Y., in the east to Laramie, Wyoming, in the west, Canada to the north, and Texas to the south, the cost of transportation will be a factor in the first formal meeting. It was predicted that the 1982 UFO Summit Conference could be the most significant meeting of this type ever held; the participants through their letters and telephone calls have confirmed this prediction in glowing terms. The first giant stride has been made to unite UFOlogy in North America. It is now the responsibility of each one of us to be a part of the future of UFOlogy as a science and a profession. Will you accept this challenge? Your elected represent- atives have voiced their approval.

Allen Hynek's guest editorial (No. 175, Sept. 1982) both state that I played a large role in the selection of participants for the NOVA/BBC program \"The Case of the UFOs.\" This is incorrect. The facts are these: I had one substantive phone conversation with the producer, John Groom of the BBC, who called me from London in early 1982. This was a very preliminary call, prior to his beginning any travels or interviews. He asked my advice on who might contribute to the program. I assume he asked the same question of everyone else he spoke to as well; that is good jounalistic practice. I gave him the names of five persons. Two of those five persons ended up being in the program. The work of both of those two was already familiar to Mr. Groom when he called me. About a dozen other people appear in the program; I neither had mentioned them to Groom nor had anything to do with their \"selection.\" My only other communication with Groom was about a month after the first when he called to see if we might be able to meet when he made his first trip to the United States. Our schedules did not permit it. To this day I have had no other communication with Mr. Groom. The attempt of disgruntled UFO proponents to rationalize the program's critical, investigative approach to UFO reports as somehow being due to a \"bias\" of the Skeptical Inquirer has no factual support. I assume Mr. Groom made his editorial judgements based on his own assessment of the credibility of individual UFO witnesses and investigators.

I will not attempt to define the conditions in this montly Director's Message, but will ask that our legal staff provide an interpretation that is applicable to our members in layman's language. In the meantime, a review of the Internal Revene Service sections that apply will be enumerated. MUFON, Mutual UFO Network, Inc. is exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is a publicly supported organization of the type described in section 509(a)(2). Donors may deduct contributions from their Federal income tax. Bequests, legacies, devises, transfers, or gifts to MUFON, Mutual UFO Network, Inc. or for our use are deductible for Federal estate and gift tax purposes if they meet the applicable provisions of sections 2055, 2106, and 2522 of the Code.

Peter has made valuable contributions as a member of the North American UFO Federation Steering Committee. On February 15 through 19, 1983, MUFON will be featured with an exhibit at the Sunrise Mall, 8302 South Padre Island Drive, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. each day. The exhibit will consist of a large photo display and the activities of the Mutual UFO Network, a continous slide show of CEI, II, and III photos and cases, and scheduled video programs titled \"The Chariots of the Gods,\" \"UFOs Are Real,\" and \"The UFO Experience.\" This is part of MUFON's public relations program. The photo exhibit is constructed as a portable unit that may be disassembled for transporting. It is similar in design to the one built by Sherman J. Larsen for CUFOS. Mr. Larsen shared his construction ideas, sketches, and a photograph of their display as a guide. Sherm is the President of CUFOS and a Director of NICAP. He was instrumental in reprinting NICAP's The UFO Evidence edited by Richard H. Hall, which is now available from NICAP or CUFOS. NICAP now is basically a document publishing and distribution firm and not a membership organization in its present configuration. We want to thank Stephen J. Kurzweil, M.D., 936 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10021 for his list of pertinent quotations titled \"UFOs Mean Business.\" Due to the success of the organizational meetings in Corpus Christi, Texas, we are now planning to have similar meetings in Austin to revitalize the capital city into an effective investigative team during January or early February.

The November 30 issue tells of a Russian geologist who allegedly was saved from drowning by a UFO and later claimed to have met his extraterrestrial benefactor on the streets of Moscow. An article in the December 7 ENQUIRER reports on over 400 cases of UFOs stalling car engines or causing electrical system malfunctions. Such reports date back to 1909. The \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" segment of December OMNI has a report on a 1979 case from Scotland in which a forester was allegedly attacked by two robot-like \"things\" from a landed UFO. In the January issue, a biology professoi speculates that extra- terrestrials will look very much like humans, rather than being the monstrous creatures of science-fiction. James Oberg's article in the January issue of FATE gives his explanation for UFO sightings reported in the Soviet Union and in Argentina on June 14, 1980. Needless to say, Oberg finds a conventional explanation — Soviet satellite launchings — for the reports and manages to disregard anything which might tend to invalidate his theory. The \"scientific method\" at work! The writings of the late Richard S. Shaver generated one of the greatest controversies ever seen in the ranks of science-fiction \"fandom.\" Shaver had the audacity to claim that his stories of subterranean races and ancient civilizations were based on fact. His concepts have been \"cussed and discussed\" for nearly 40 years. A recent privately-published booklet, SHAVER: RESHARPENED, represents some of the best writing on this particular subject that it has been my pleasure to read. Canadian researcher/writer Jim Pobst discusses various aspects of the \"Shaver Myster\" and provides a good background for those not familiar with it. To me, the most fascinating portion of the booklet deals with the various forms of \"Mech,\" the highly- advanced machinery of the \"Elder Race,\" which supposedly still function deep in the caverns beneath our feet. Technicians with an open mind may want to study this section in detail. Pobst's writing style is both erudite and very enjoyable. Included with the booklet is a 14-page checklist of Shaver's original stories, for those wanting to obtain them. The price for both items is only $5.00 and orders may be send to Pobst at: General Delivery, Maple Ridge, B.C., Canada V2X 6AO.

SchuesslerV newsletters. The Action Item Format became the media for this Newsletter No. 3 dated November 29, 1982, requiring the vote of each of the eight members on significant items related to the proposed bylaws of the federation. It was broken down into the following categories: The purpose of the federation (11 issues); scope and authority of the federation (7 points); membership (9 stipulations); financial (10 procedures); and Executive Committee (11 requirements). Items to be covered in future action item forms will include the duties of the officers, budgets, committees, consultants, publications, and meetings. John may be contacted at P.O. Box 58485, Houston, TX 77258- 8485. Your Director investigated the cost of the teleconference method of communication between the members of the steering committee and forwarded same to Mr. Schuessler. The Mutual UFO Network underwrote the cost of conducting the 1982 UFO Summit Meeting in Toronto, Ontario on July 6th, however, the costs of a teleconference arrangement must be shared or another financial source sought. Mr. Schuessler is to be commended for his fine work as chairman of the steering committee in helping to unite the efforts of UFOlogists in North America. The theme for the 1982 MUFON UFO Symposium at the Huntington- Sheraton Hotel in Pasadena, Calif., on July 1,2, and 3 is \"UFOs — A Scientific Challenge.\" Speakers already confirmed are James M. McCampbell, Richard F. Haines, Mrs. Ann Druffel, Paul C. Cerny, and Peter Jordan. Other speakers will be announced in the near future by William Hassel, chairperson for the symposium. Thomas Gates will serve as Master of Ceremonies. Jack A. Jennings, State Director for Montana, has announced the appointment of James R. Leming as the new State Section Director for Cascade County. Jim has recently moved from Cincinnati, Ohio to Box 4398, R.R. 4, Great Falls, MT 59401; telephone (406) 761-7127. Readers of the MUFON UFO Journal are familiar with his expertise as an artist. Howard S. Finkelstein, Box 163, Port Aransas, TX 78373, telephone (512) 749-6988, has accepted the position of State Section Director for Nueces, San Patricio, Aransas, and Refugio Counties in the Corpus Christi area. Howard was the host for the recent MUFON meeting at the Civic Center in Port Aransas to organize a field investigator team. Mr. Finkelstein has a B.S. degree in Geology and has been working towards a masters degree. He also speaks Spanish which is an asset in south Texas. Robert M. Hendrickson, Jr., Ph.D., of 501 S. Chapel St., Newark, DE 19713 recently volunteered his services as a Consultant in Entomology. Bob will also be involved in field investigations with Juan J. Magrans, our Acting State Director for Delaware. Dr. Hendrickson ordered all of the MUFON publications so that he could be apprised of the research accomplished to date. We have received a few letters from members inquiring about the current status of the Journal. We recognize that the Journals are behind schedule and apologize for any inconvenience that may have been created for our members. Due to typesetting personnel problems at our printer in Seguin, Texas, the Journal is now being published by our original printer, Larry Boatright, operating as B- W Graphics, Inc. in Versailles, Missouri (formerly Morgan County Printers). Some of the delay may be attributed to the logistics of changing printers and the distances separating our Editor, Richard H. Hall in Brentwood, Md., the typesetting and printing Versailles, Mo., and the mailing from Seguin, Tex. There are no plans to combine monthly issues in order to become current, since the \"pipeline\" is full of far more material than we can currently publish. We hope to systematically speed up our processes and logistics each month until we are mailing the Journal concurrently with the monthly issue identified on the cover. On November 21st, a telephone conference was held with one of the new MUFON public relations committees at the home of Mrs. Marge Christensen. These committees are being organized to provide the public with factual and positive UFO information to combat the negative exposure attributed to the vocal minority. The east cost committee in Massachusetts is composed of Walter Webb, Joan Thompson, Barry Greenwood, and Mrs. Christensen. Other committees will be made up of members in California and Texas. All, news releases will emanate from MUFON's headquarters in Seguin, Texas, to the appropriate news media. Marge and her committee are already preparing a news release based upon material provided by Mr. Greenwood.
