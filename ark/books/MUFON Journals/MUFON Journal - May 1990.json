By the cover date (May), we're almost a month late again. On the other hand, Walter Webb's June astronomy column arrives in time for our readers to make use of it. Sometime soon, we hope to be back on a regular schedule, but it's not going to be easy with the upcoming Symposium and the editor bound for two European conferences that impinge on the UFO phenomenon at the same time. Your patience is appreciated. In the meantime, we think we've put together another interesting Journal, with Dr. Bruce Maccabee reporting on recent UFO videos, and two other Ph.D.'s (Ted Spickler and Barry Downing) also weighing in with timely articles, along with all of our regular columns and departments. Your comments are welcome. IN THIS ISSUE RECENT UFO VIDEOTAPES Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D. 3 UFO HOAXES & AGENTS: A SOUR SONATA  Eugenia Macer-Story 8 THE ROCK OF AGES PRINCIPLE  Rev. Barry H.

O ver the last year I have received four video- tapes for analysis. These are all daytime videos and come from places as far apart as Japan, Spain, Western Maryland (very far out!) and (you guessed it) Gulf Breeze, PL. (No, Mr. Ed was not involved with any of these!) All have been studied on a frame-by-frame basis and three have been found to contain more than the \"usual\" unusual characteristics. Bill Sudbrink Video On May 28, 1989, while returning from a vacation in the area of Green Bank, West Virginia, Bill Sudbrink of New York and his brother saw UFOs several times. The first sighting oc- curred shortly after 10 a.m. while he was driving in West Virginia. The sighting was of a shiny \"daylight disc.\" Unfortunately it only lasted a few seconds and Bill was not able to get his videocamera out of the car in time to film it. Nevertheless, he was now \"sensitized\" to the appearance of UFOs and he kept the camera with him as he continued to drive. About two and half hours later he had a second sighting, this time in western Maryland. This caused him to stop his car and stand beside the road while holding his camera and looking around at the sky to see if it would reappear a third time. It did and he managed to film the appearance of a bright light that literally came \"out of the blue.\" The UFO was a bright light against the clear sky background. He filmed it for about four seconds and then it simply disappeared in one frame of the video (1/30 sec) at about the center of the field of view of the camera. Unfortunately the image of the light is so small (about two mm diameter on a 13\" monitor where the scan line spacing — one \"line pair\" - is about one mm) that there are no discerni- ble features other than its brightness. The brightness fluctuated, sometimes very rapidly, occasionally disappear- ing in one TV \"field\" (1/60 sec or 1/2 of a \"frame\") and returning at good brightness in the next field. Such rapid brightness changes are difficult to ex- plain in terms of conventional air- borne/atmospheric phenomena. Other portions of his video show nearby and distant scenery, and even a passing passenger jet. This non- UFO imagery establishes that his camera was operating properly and was focused. It also establishes that the UFO at its brightest was brighter than normal objects in the vicinity, but not brighter than specular reflections of the sun. He also got images of dark objects against the sky which may be the result of insects flying past the camera close to the lens. Although the appearance of the bright light in the sky is by itself an unexpected occurence, from the point of view of photo (video) analysis, that is about all that can be said about this event. Saturn-Shaped Of more interest for analysis is the next video, that of Mr. Hamazaki of Kanazawa, Japan, west of Tokyo. This video, taken during the evening of Ju- ly 7, 1989, was shown on Japanese TV and has also appeared in TV news and documentary shows in the USA. It shows an object, against the clear evening sky, which passed nearly over his house. The shape of the image suggests that the object can be represented approximately as \"the planet Saturn with a square ring,\" or a sphere with a square card of larger size cut through its center, except that the upper half of the sphere is not visi- ble and must be inferred from the ap- parently circular lower half below the \"square ring\" (see Figure 1). In either representation the plane of the \"ring\" was apparently horizon- tal (i.e., parallel to the earth's surface). The upper half is not visible, perhaps because it was blocked by the larger sized square ring. The camera was, of course, viewing upward, so the ring is seen from an oblique angle. Of particular importance is the fact that the shape of the Hamazaki UFO is virtually identical to the shape of a UFO photographed in Hawaii on January 2, 1975 by Michael Lind- strom. Lindstrom's wife called his at- tention to the strange object passing over and he shot three color slides of it. The first and last show nearly the same viewing aspect, while the sec- ond slide shows a different aspect (see Figure 1). The image in each photo suggests that the UFO was shaped like a \"Saturn with a square ring.\" Some small bright dots are evident on the top edge of the ring in the first photo. The only clear difference between the Hamazaki and Lindstrom UFOs is the relative brightness between the \"main body\" (the spherical part) and the ring: in the Hamazaki video the ring is brighter than the main body, and the reverse is true in the Lind- strom pictures. The March 1990 issue of the MUFON Journal contains a brief letter by Richard Haines concerning the Hamazaki video and a photo made from a TV screen. A much more detailed analysis of the Hamazaki-Lindstrom connection is presented in the International UFO Reporter for May-June, 1990. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Spanish Video The third video of interest was taken about five miles south of Estepona on the southeast coast of Spain on August 10, 1989. This is quite close to Gibraltar, which was southwest of the witnesses. The video was taken by Dr. William Heijster, a Dutch military psychologist who works at the Ministry of Defense in The Hague. Dr. Heijster contacted the Fund for UFO Research in the fall of 1989 and offered to send a copy of his videotape for the cost of copying and transferral from European TV standard format to USA standard VHS. Last winter the Fund received the videotape with supplementary in- formation from Dr. Heijster. He was on vacation with his fami- ly driving southwest along the eastern coastal highway at about 9 p.m. when they saw the UFO northwest of them in the late evening sky. They stopped to watch the object. Mr. Heijster filmed it off and on over a period of about an hour. During that time it seemed to be hovering over a moun- tain. He said that it appeared to rotate about an axis at high speed, although this rotation is not apparent on the videotape. What is apparent is a slow change in overall shape from conical to circular. He said that it appeared bright on the upper surface and ap- peared to have a shadow on the bottom. After about an hour the UFO split into two parts which separated and then faded or \"dissolved.\" Unfor- tunately he did not have his camera on at the time that the UFO split apart, but he did film one part of the UFO expanding, fading and \"dissolv- ing\" into thin air. The angular elevation to the UFO cannot be determined accurately from the videotape. It is estimated to have been in the range of 30-50 degrees. The videotape shows nearby palm fronds on a palm tree as well as the UFO. These provide some foreground reference points that show that the camera moved around randomly, which is to be expected (it was not mounted on a tripod). The camera FIGURE HAMAZAKl- LINDSTROM UFO CONNECTION Bright Ring' Darker Bottom (shading lines indicate darkness) Occasionally gap appears in the ring with brightening of the ends of the 'ring* PHOTO .1 PHOTO 2 Bottom part not distinguishable against the sky PHOTO 3 (much more distant) used was a Panasonic S-VHS NV- MS50E with a 6:1 zoom (9-54 mm) automatic iris and F1.2 lens. At my request Dr. Heijster per- formed a calibration experiment which allowed me to determine the actual angular size of a filmed object from the image size on a TV screen. Dr. Heijster found that a one-meter long ruler at a distance of 10 m (angular width of arctan (Im/lOm) = 5.7 degrees) makes an image at full zoom (54 mm focal length) that HAMAZAKl VIDEO IMAGES (seen against the blue sky) Bright spots on ring Dark ring Bright bottom (spherical or pyramidal shape) THE THREE LINDSTROM UFO IMAGES (seen against thin white cloud) is 43 cm long on a TV screen that is 48 cm wide. Converting this to a screen 28 cm wide (on a 13\" diagonal TV monitor which was used for analysis) means that an image that is 25 cm long on a 13\" monitor cor- responds to 5.7 degrees at full zoom. For a short period of time (several seconds) starting about 40 seconds in- to the video, the width of the UFO im- age is about 3.3 cm. Assuming that this image was obtained at full zoom its size corresponds to (3.3/25) x 5.7 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The image is \"pure\" white against the clear blue sky. Small brighter points of light appear to \"dance\" around on the surface and particularly along the left edge of the object. = 0.75 degrees. At the same time it is 1.5 cm high, or 0.34 degrees from the center of the base to the peak. (For comparison, the angular size of the moon is very close to 0.5 degrees.) The video of the UFO lasts three minutes and 53 seconds. During this time Dr. Heijster occasionally zoomed in and out, causing the UFO image size to change. Usually he had film of a nearby palm frond within the view of the camera. Mr. Heijster did not say that the size, as it appeared to his naked eye changed, as would have happened if the object moved toward or away from him. He said that it hovered in one place. Hence I have assumed that the largest measured image (3.3 cm wide) corresponds to the image at the max- imum zoom, and that any other size image is at a lesser zoom magnifica- tion. I have used only the maximum image size to estimate the actual size. (As a check on this assumption I have noted that the minimum size image in the first part of the video is about 5-6 mm in diameter. This size occurs as he \"unzooms\" the lens to get a wide field of view. This size is about l/6th of the maximum size of the im- age, 3.3 cm, which is consistent with the 6:1 zoom (focal length ratio) capability of his lens. Hence this minimum sized image provides justification for the above assumption that the maximum sized image oc- curred at maximum zoom rather than at some intermediate value.) An angular size of 0.75 degrees cor- responds to an actual size that depends upon the assumed distance to the ob- ject. The size, S, is given by the formula S = D x tan (0.75) = 0.013D, where D is the assumed distance. Thus at 1,000 ft. distance the width of the UFO would have been 13 feet. At one mile it would have been 69 feet wide, at FIGURE 2 W. HEIJSTER VIDEO FROM SPAIN INITIAL SHAPE OF OBJECT Very bright white against the blue late evening sky FINAL SHAPE OF OBJECT Very white (before it split into two smaller round objects and disappeared) 10,000 ft, 130 feet wide, and so on. Dr. Heijster had the impression that the UFO was hovering near a mountain range (the Sierra Bermeja) at a distance of several miles, suggesting a size well over 100 feet wide. The video can be very roughly divided into four parts. During the first part, lasting about one minute, the shape of the image is that of a cone or \"coolie hat\" viewed from the side (see Figure 2). The image is \"pure\" white against the clear blue sky. Small brighter points of light appear to \"dance\" around on the surface and particularly along the left edge of the object. Whether these are actual features of the UFO or artifacts of the camera electronics is not known. Some small black dots also seem to move around the right side. These black dots may be a result of the in- ability of the camera electronics to re- spond accurately to bright spots at the edge of the image. During the second part, lasting for the next minute, the shape gradually changes from conical to nearly round. This change in shape leads to the sug- gestion that the actual shape was that of a cone which slowly rotated in space. The edges of the image seem to \"twinkle\" with tiny bright dots. From about two minutes until three minutes and 47 seconds, the image is almost perfectly round, with some sort of motion of tiny bright dots around the edge. Then, at three minutes and 49.87 sec (roughly) the image suddenly (in one field) becomes very small. Accord- ing to Dr. Heijster, this last portion of the film was shot just after the UFO split into two smaller parts and the parts separated. He said that he had been watching and filming off and on for nearly an hour. He was not film- ing when suddenly, to his surprise, he saw the UFO split into two parts. He quickly raised the camera and turned it on, but he was not able to capture both of the smaller parts. He could on- ly get one into the view-finder. The image on the film is a small bright \"dot\" that moves around rapidly on the screen as a result of Dr. Heij- ster's attempt to stabilize the camera and point it toward the UFO. In about a second he stabilized the camera and the image became quite stationary. After about three seconds, the bright dot rapidly fades while increasing in diameter. This fading and increase in size lasts for only about five frames (about 0.2 sec) until the object is vir- tually indistinguishible against the sky. A very faint \"ghost\" image seems to remain for a second and then it is gone at about three minutes and 54 seconds into the video. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"According to Dr. Heijstcr there were many witnesses. He supplied several copies of newspaper stories about the sightings. Unfortunately no other photos or videos have become available for analysis. Gulf Breeze The final videotape to be discussed here is that of Mr. James Steward, a MUFON investigator in Gulf Breeze, FL. On January 28, 1990, he was cleaning his backyard when he no- ticed, out of the corner of his eye, something flashing in the sky. It was about 2:35 CST in the afternoon on a clear day (Temp., 65; wind E.S.E. 10 kts; visibility 7 mi; clouds scattered at 7,000 ft). According to his MUFON report, he first thought it was a small helicopter because the flashes made him think of sunlight reflecting off the rotating blades. But then he realized that the \"helicopter\" had an odd orange color. He began to suspect it might be an unusual object. He asked his son, who was just going in- to the house, to get his camcorder, an RCA ProEdit Model CC311 with an F1.2 lens and an 8X zoom capability. After about a minute he returned with the camera and gave it to his father. Mr. Steward put it on manual focus and sighted through the viewfinder, which gives a black and white picture of what the camera sees (it is a miniature black and white TV set). He was not able to spot the UFO in the viewfinder so he gave the camera back to his son who finally found the UFO in the viewfinder and filmed for many seconds, after which he returned the camera to his father, who filmed a bit and then handed it once again to his son just before the UFO got too far away to be visible in the bright sky. Mr. Steward said that the object was easy to spot with the naked eye, but not so easy in the camera viewfinder. Mr. Steward said that when he first saw the object and during most of the videotaping it was moving from east to west, but then, when he handed the camera to his son for the second [FIGURE 3| STEWARD VIDEO FROM GULF BREEZE Location of upper light \\ t Locations of lower light Dark shading indicates \"blobby\" orange glow between the upper and lower lights time, it moved toward the north. He watched until it was too far away to be seen. During the latter part of the sighting his wife and two other sons came out to watch. (At one point in the video Mrs. Steward can be heard asking one of the boys to get the binoculars.) He went to the phone and called friends who live a few miles north of him. He asked them to get a camera and to go outside and look for the ob- ject, and they did so, but were unable to see anything. Mr. Steward described the UFO as being round and orange colored. There were flashes of light that \"ran around the bottom of the object. These were elongated flashes and were not connected to the object. There was a gap between the bottom of the object and the uppermost of the flashes.\" The videotape confirms much of what Mr. Steward says about the ob- ject. Unfortunately the image is not large and so there is not a lot of detail. However, it can be described general- ly as a oval orange \"blob,\" i.e., without sharply defined edges as seen against the blue sky, with white flashes that occur, seemingly randomly, at the top and bottom of the \"blob.\" The intensity of the top light is usually quite steady with occasional bright flashes. The bottom light is generally not visible except during brief flashes that last for one or several video frames. The videotape of the UFO totals about one minute, 48 seconds. During the first 38 seconds no UFO is seen, only the blue sky. Presumably this is the time that Mr. Steward and his son were trying to find the UFO in the viewfinder. At 38 seconds the UFO first appears in the video, and his sons says \"I got it.\" A frame by frame analysis starting at this point shows that the image in- itially is an elliptical (horizontal major axis) orange \"blob\" with a small white light just above the blob and to the left of its center. This is the \"basic\" image throughout the video. The blob is about 5 mm wide by 2 mm high. Thirty-eight fields (a bit over a half second) after the UFO first appears in the video the upper light brightens. Then, 47 fields after the first ap- pearance of the UFO image a second white light flashes on just at the bot- tom of the orange blob and to the left of the upper light such that a line con- necting the lower and upper white dots has a slope of about 45 degrees upward and to the right (see Figure 3). This lower light lasts for four fields and disappears in field 51, not reap- pearing until field 60 (one second after the UFO first appears in the videotape). After this the lower light comes and goes in a seemingly ran- dom manner, sometimes appearing for only one or two TV fields. The spacing between the upper and lower white flashes is about five mm, with the orange blob in between. By 100 fields (about 1.6 sees) after its first appearance, the image of the UFO has changed somewhat. There is still the upper light and the orange blob, but now the lower light is to the right of the upper. A line connecting the two flashes then slopes 60 degrees upward and to the left (see Figure 3). Again the spacing between the flashes MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"is about five mm. As the video continues, the upper dot generally stays in the same loca- tion relative to the blob, but the lower dot seems to move around. Occa- sionally there are three or more white dots (flashes), sometimes even cross- ing over the image of the blob. By 211 fields into the video (3.5 seconds) the two white flashes are above one another, with the upper one still be- ing rather steady and the lower one random (see Figure 3). For example, going field by field and looking at the lower light one finds: fields 200-202: not present; field 203: lower dot present; 204-206: not present; 207-209: present; 210: no; 211-230: yes, but brightness changes from occasionally very faint to bright; 231-233; no: 234-239: yes; 240: no, and so on. As the video continues, the spac- ing between the upper and lower flashes diminishes. The last section of the video shows the upper branch of a nearby tree and the UFO, very faint and small now, as a randomly flashing light moving downward with respect to the branch. This sort of motion, corresponding to a decrease in the angular elevation, is consistent with In recent years skeptics have argued that if UFOs are real there would be more video- tapes of them. Evidently, in spite of themselves, they were \"correct\" on both accounts. the claim of the witness that the UFO was moving away, presumably on a nearly horizontal trajectory. Mr. Steward, at my request, filmed a ruler at a distance of 23 feet. This provided a calibration of the effective focal length of the camera at full zoom when the video is played on a 13-inch monitor and this, in turn, provided a calibration of the angular size of a filmed object as a function of its im- age size: 0.0035 rad/cm (0.2 de- grees/cm; 0.1 rad = 5.7 degrees). Thus the maximum spacing of the white flashes, five mm = 0.5 cm, cor- responds to 0.00175 rad or 0.1 degrees. A direct multiplication of the angular size in radians by the distance yields the actual size (as measured perpendicular to the line of sight). Thus, in this case, if it had been 1,000 feet away the spacing between the flashes was 1.75 feet. At one mile it would be 5,280 x 0.00175 = 9.2 feet. The angular elevation of the UFO was about 45 degrees. Unfortunate- ly, the distance is not known so the exact size and altitude cannot be determined. However, it is probably safe to say that it was at least 1,000 feet away, suggesting a size of nearly two feet and an altitude of around 1,000 feet. Conclusion Videocameras have become very popular. Over the last 10 years a relatively small number of UFO videotapes, as compared to photos, has been obtained. However, within the last couple of years the number of videotapes per year has increased. We are now witnessing the impact on Ufology of the increased availability of videocameras. In recent years skeptics have argued that // UFOs are real there would be more videotapes of them. Evidently, in spite of themselves, they were \"correct\" on both accounts (number and reality). Finally, A Weekly Television Program Just About UFOs Palm Springs, CA. \"The presence of extraterrestrials on this planet is a worldwide phenomenon. The evi- dence is overwhelming and undeni- able. The question is: Who are they and why are they here?,\" asks Rick Edwards, a spokesman for E.T. Clearinghouse. E.T. Clearinghouse, the producers of UFO Spotlight, a weekly news/documentary television pro- gram, announced the release of their pilot episode. The program focuses on UFO and extraterrestrial related issues, and they expect to be broad- casting by satellite early this summer. \"More than 23 million people have seen UFOs,\" Edwards explains. \"The public wants to know what is going on, but traditional news media only occa- sionally offer a brief news clip of a par- ticular event and treat it as entertain- ment or comic relief,\" he adds. \"There is currently no serious national televi- sion coverage.\" According to Mr. Edwards, UFO Spotlight will fill this void in television programming for continuous, in-depth coverage of UFOs and related subjects. \"The program will explore the impact of the extraterrestrial presence on this planet and our civilization,\" Edwards explains. \"UFO Spotlight asks the questions that others shy away from, and it encourages the kind of informed speculation that some programs avoid.\" Interviews with leading researchers, authors and UFO investigators were recently videotaped at the Ozark UFO Conference in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Portions of these interviews will be included in the pilot program and in subsequent shows.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 UFO Hoaxes & Agents: A Sour Sonata By Eugenia Macer-Story Eugenia Macer-Story holds a B.S. in Speech from Northwestern University and a Master's in Fine Arts from Columbia University in New York City, where she present- ly resides. She is the author of two books, Congratulations: The UFO Reality and Angels of Time: A Book of Hours. A poet and playwright, she has also contributed numerous UFO-related articles to Pursuit, Magical Blend and similar magazines. R eading Peter Rojcewicz's article on Men in Black in the March 1990 issue of the MUFON Journal reminded me of some recent experiences of my own, as well as the difficulty of determin- ing just how central or peripheral such encounters are to the UFO phenom- enon as a whole. In and of themselves, they don't always make sense. Approached holistically, however, a pattern begins to emerge. In February of 1987, for example, I returned to New York from Chicago, where I had attended the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. While there, I presented a poster paper, \"Verification of Six Predictions,\" which explained how six of my psychic predictions, made in the context of various research pro- jects, had been confirmed according to various associative criteria. I also had with me a videotape of my own original creation, \"Six Way Time Play,\" which I had just retrieved from a prospective producer's desk on my way to Chicago. At one point I returned to my room and had the vague perception that my belongings had been rearranged. Still, I didn't make much of it at the time. Back in New York, though, I replayed the video to make sure that it had been properly rewound. To my amazement, instead of the original opening choreography, I found myself confronted by thirty seconds of a steamy love scene, seemingly lifted straight out of the 1950's! Had the producer or the staff at \"Private Music,\" where I'd submitted the video, altered the original? A phone call assured me they had not. Then where had it been altered, and why? The most logical assumption was in Chicago, as a form of embarrassment. One doesn't want to unnecessari- ly belabor the issue of sexual harrass- ment, but I had to barken back to the previous year's AAAS meeting in Philadelphia, in May of 1986, when I had also presented a poster paper. Immediately upon my return I de- cided to go swimming. To my dismay, my expensive swimsuit had been sug- gestively mutilated in the groin area. Same meeting, same syndrome? Pervasive Paranoia? Either I'm paranoid, or the per- petrators are pervasive. In 1989, I was scheduled to give a talk on upstate New York UFO sightings before the U.S. Psychotronics Association convention at Sacramen- to State College, California. At 8:30 a.m., on my way to the meeting and in a deserted hallway, I suddenly found myself confronted by a man who appeared to be in his mid-fifties and perhaps of East Indian origin. He shook my hand warmly, although I had never met him before, and be- gan to stroke my forearms. He then asked me what I thought was a rather inappropriate question about my sex life, to which I answered that such things were none of his business. \"I come from England,\" he responded in a complete non sequitur. \"I do odd jobs.\" I excused myself and hurried down the hall to my lecture. Looking back over my extensive experiences in the realm of UFO in- vestigations, I could cite an almost interminable litany of similar incidents. What strikes me as unusual is that no similar string of \"oddities\" or interven- tions\" in any way plagues my \"tradi- tional\" career as a poet and play- wright. The significance seems obvious. Part of the problem, admittedly, is knowing what to tie to what. By way of example, in 1978,1 had begun cor- responding with one Miloz Wosniak, a Polish citizen who said he was in- terested in exchanging handcrafted goods for Xeroxes of American UFO reports. Four years later he offered to pay my expenses if I would visit him in Poland, which I gracefully declined. In the meantime I had been con- tacted by a group of people who wanted me to psychically divine the status of a Polish diplomat who had been taken in for questioning. This I was able to do with some degree of success, in exchange for an English translation of the Tass UFO articles I had received from Wosniak. Then, in 1984, I found myself on the way to visit Dr. Elizabeth Rauscher in San Francisco. Who should I find myself seated next to, seemingly as if by \"coincidence,\" but a United Nations employee with knowledge of the selfsame detained diplomat, who had since been released? My visit proved most interesting. For starters, and without my prior knowledge, Russell Targ addressed the meeting I attended on the subject of Soviet ESP research. Later, in Dr. Raucher's home, I was handed a piece of twisted metal, supplied by the Canadian government, and asked to psychoscope it, that is, employ my psychometric powers to see if I could determine anything about its origins. I had the impression that an explo- sion had been involved, and that peo- ple associated the explosion with a supernatural occurrence. Rauscher told me the object was reported to have come from an exploded UFO.

Only after the fact did I think of the \"Polish Connection.\" Had my \"diplomatic\" airplane companion slipped me a Mickey Finn unawares? If so, it indicated that she and her associates may have possibly known more about my upcoming weekend itinerary than I did. Implications The implication that covert \"agents\" may be involved with both the UFO and ESP research arenas is as in- timate as it is international. In 1983, for example, I had written an article for OMNI Magazine's \"UFO Update\" column about a contactee I con- sidered a sort of \"Typhoid Mary,\" a woman who was apparently able to infect others with UFO sightings wherever she went. Although I was paid, the article never appeared in print, for reasons that have always re- mained curious. It appears that editor Pamela Wein- traub decided to kill the article be- cause of a series of phone calls she received from one James Schneller, who claimed at the time to work for the Navy department of \"health physics\" in Bethesda, Maryland. Schneller was an acquaintance of Typhoid Mary, and he tried to become an even closer acquaintance of mine, to no avail. Schneller was present in Boston when I interviewed Typhoid Mary, but so was a male companion of mine, who had driven me down from New York. While we talked, so did they, in another room. Later, I learned that Schneller had engaged my com- panion in a series of probing innuen- does and suggestions about my per- sonal sex life. He later made the same suggestions to Typhoid Mary herself, and apparently to Pamela Weintraub as well. The result of the latter was that OMNI killed the article, not want- ing to lend even the semblance of a platform to people who were becom- ing increasingly self-promoting in their actions. I concurred. But obviously Schneller himself was the odd man out. Why had he become so involved with Typhoid Mary in the first place, and seeming- ly from such a sympathetic side, on- ly to work so assiduously behind the scenes to have the subsequent \"publicity\" on her killed? Schneller had first introduced himself to Typhoid Mary near the Ar- my's Tobyhanna Materials Depot in Pennsylvania, the site of her most traumatic encounters with UFO craft. Yet a quick inquiry revealed that Schneller was not employed by the Army, but the Navy, and at Bethesda, some distance away. What was he do- ing there, then, and why? The implication that covert \"agents\" may be involved with both the UFO and ESP research arenas is as in- timate as it is international. As a \"pawn,\" Schneller seems out of place on the tactical chessboard. Typhoid Mary's story, had it reached print, would have been but a footnote in the vast ufological landscape. But Schneller also obviously manipulated the situation, to the point of having the article killed. The only logical con- clusion I can draw is that there must be more to the Typhoid Mary scenario than first met the eye. To find out what that is, I hope I won't have to endure anymore would- be UFO lotharios or Mickey Finns poured from a diplomatic-pouch in the process.

Barry H. Downing, Ph.D. Downing is a MUFON consultant in Theology and the author of the recently reprinted The Bible and Flying Saucers. A s a member of the Board of the Fund for UFO Research, I was recent- ly given access to a letter from a man in Sheffield, England, ad- dressed to Budd Hopkins. The letter was classified by Hopkins as a \"possi- ble abduction\" which had not yet been investigated. The man said he and a friend were driving along a dark road one even- ing when they saw a \"brightly-lit ob- ject\" beside the road ahead. At this point he \"was absolutely frozen with terror, for no reason.\" His friend had a similar reaction, but as they drew near they realized the object was on- ly a tractor. Long after the original experience, the man drove over the same stretch of road where he \"was overcome with a sort of panic, and my eyes started to fill with tears.\" Having read In- truders, the man was now wondering \"if you know of any cases where UFO's have effectively 'disguised' themselves to the onlooker as every- day objects (in this case a tractor)?\" Disguised UFOs The issue of disguise is one of the most fundamental aspects of the UFO mystery, and should become one of the next major areas of UFO research. Up until now, the disguise issue has been only on the fringe of research. But it has long been a major theme in John Keel's work particularly in Tro- jan Horse and The Mothman Pro- phecies, with their speculations that UFO beings can mimic our culture, either with the Men in Black concept, or perhaps via unmarked helicopters that we hope are flown by the CIA. The issue of disguise and deception Most abductions, in fact, ap- pear disguised by some type of memory suppression. also surfaces in Raymond Fowler's The Andreasson Affair: Phase II, especially in regard to the strange phone calls Betty received, the helicopters pursuing her, and her vi- sion of the door she was not allowed to tell about. Whitley Strieber was similary concerned about disguise and the demonic in Transformation. Most abductions, in fact, appear disguised by some type of memory suppression, which is how Budd Hopkins discovered the \"missing time\" principle. Jacques Vallee coined the term \"metalogic\" to describe his interpretation of the disguise- deception issue. I suspect that one reason why the disguise issue has not been dealt with more thoroughly is that the ET hypothesis continues to remain the most popular theory among most serious UFO researchers. The ETH permits us to believe — perhaps hope — that UFO beings are mainly like ourselves, except that they have been traveling in space a little longer. But there is now a vast bank of data that suggests that UFOs can do things that simply outstrip our im- agination, that UFOs come from a world in which things are not as they appear. The issue of disguise — the metalogical — even shows up in just those places where we look hardest for nuts and bolts: in the Crash/Retrieval field. In the February 1989 issue of the Journal, for exam- ple, Leonard Stringfield reported the story of a crashed UFO about 30 feet in external diameter, and the size of a football field inside. Personal Belief I realize that belief is a personal matter, but speaking for myself, I find the evidence that our government has had access to several crash-retrievals very convincing; likewise, the evi- dence for multiple UFO abductions seems equally convincing. The pro- blem is how to interpret the meaning of these aspects of the UFO phenomenon, particularly if UFOs can take on almost any disguise. My impression is that UFO re- searchers are sharply divided over the disguise issue, in part because it has not been systematically addressed. We all know it is potentially part of the UFO problem, but we are not agreed as to how it should be assessed in our weighing of the data and in the for- mulation of hypotheses. Part of the recent debate among Hopkins, Jacobs and Vallee (February 1989 Journal), is that Hopkins and Vallee do not agree on the impor- tance of the disguise issue, either in the process of gathering data, or as to evaluating it. Perhaps to over simplify, Vallee is strongly committed to the disguise- deceptive nature of the UFO phe- nomenon, and therefore he is ex- tremely skeptical that we can for- mulate any useful conclusions about what UFOs are, other than that they apparently control us, like \"a rat press- ing levers\" (Dimensions, p. 280), and that they employ disguise and decep- tion as part of the control system. Because of his belief in the disguise issue, Vallee believes Hopkins and Jacobs are being too naive in the pro- cess of gathering data via hypnosis. Vallee believes the UFO phenomenon can feed us anything it so desires through the abduction process; fur- thermore, those using hypnosis can too easily contaminate the data with their own preconceptions. Hopkins' answer to this charge is that the only time Vallee was truly scientific dates to his earliest work, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 Anatomy of a Phenomenon. Since then, it has been all down hill, with Vallee getting more and more lost in subjectivism, from Passport to Magonia to Messengers of Deception to Dimensions. I would not want to defend all of Vallee's work. He and I have cor- responded privately, and we do not agree on how to address all the issues. But we do agree that the disguise- deception issue is fundamental to the evaluation process. Budd Hopkins and I have also talked privately about the moral behavior of UFO beings. Hopkins has written an article, \"What They're Do- ing to Us\" (International UFO Reporter, September/October 1987), in which he expresses anger over what he calls \"extraterrestrial indif- ference\" to the deep psychic trauma caused by UFO abductions. I certainly cannot deny his right to this anger. He says they have a \"flaw in their ap- parent power,\" in that they carry out their abduction experiments with such disregard for human suffering. The reason why such a discussion should occur between Hopkins and myself is because I have long argued for the \"God Hypothesis,\" and from Hopkins' point of view it seems un- God-like to abduct people and ter- rorize them. For Hopkins, a truly moral God would not relate to planet Earth like the UFO reality apparently does. Rock of Ages The issue of disguise, deception, and UFO morality leads me to sug- gest that current UFO research con- sider what in theology I call \"The Rock of Ages Principle.\" The root of this principle derives from Exodus, Chapter 33. The background is that Moses has met God at the burning bush, has gone with God through passover and the Red Sea, has met God at Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments, and despite all this, Moses does not yet feel he has really seen God. Moses says to God, \"show me thy glory.\" And God responds, \"you cannot see My impression is that UFO researchers are sharply divided over the disguise issue, in part because it has not been systematically addressed. my face; for man shall not see me and live.\" Nevertheless, God develops a com- promise plan. \"I will put you in a cleft of the rock,\" he says, \"and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by.\" From this story comes the old hymn, \"Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me.\" God is too powerful for any human to see full face on. What does this mean? Is God an energy system like the sun — if we get too close, we will be baked? Or is God a psychological power which is so great and complex that in His presence we lose our iden- tity, like a child brought up in the presence of an over-bearing parent? The text does not say. From this concept comes the ex- planation of the hidden nature of God. God stays hidden out of love for us. If he came into the open, we would expire. Yet, if he stays com- pletely hidden, we find ourselves godless. The compromise is disguised revelation. Moses sees a burning bush (not a tractor) — harmless enough. Closer inspection reveals the presence of God.  ' \"Chosen people\" (like Andreasson and Strieber?) are targeted for revela- tion as a means of protecting the larger society. The people at Mt. Sinai say to Moses, \"You speak to us, and we will hear, but let not God speak to us, lest we die.\" (Exodus 20:19) Jesus speaks in parables to disguise his revelation (Matthew 13:13), and there are elements of disguise in the resurrection appearance of Jesus to Mary Magdalene (John 20:11-18), as well as to two disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). The revelation of the apparent voice of God to Betty Andreasson came from behind a large eagle-like bird. She was protected from the full power of the divine. Yet even with that protection, she went through tremen- dous anxiety and pain. Good or Evil? One reason why all of the above matters is that we may be ap- proaching a time when we have to decide whether UFOs are good or evil. And how we evaluate the disguise-morality issue has an impor- tant relation to our conclusion. I say we may be approaching a time when we have to decide, because there are rumors from John Lear and others that our government is deeply involved with UFOs, perhaps in direct contact. According to these rumors, at the beginning UFOs gave us technological assistance, but lately they are carrying out \"experiments\" with humans that are getting out of hand. Suppose the government goes \"public\" and cries \"Help!\" President Reagan theorized about UFO bad guys that could conceivably unite the world. How would we react if the government actually announced the reality of such a scenario? Budd Hopkins would agree that UFOs are immoral; John Keel, though miles from Hopkins in methodology, would also agree with the bad-guy analysis; Christian fun- damentalists already claim that UFOs are in league with the devil. If the government came forth and identified \"the enemy,\" much of the UFO and religious communities would un- doubtedly flock to their viewpoint. Suppose, however, that we adopt the view that UFOs are a reality so superior to humans, so powerful and complex, that it would destroy the human race if it came in direct con- tact with civilization as a whole. (Remember what whites did to Native Americans?) Yet what might UFOs do if they wanted to help us? They might do something to cause the governments of the world to change their nuclear weapons policy.

How could this interaction with our government have been carried out without destroying the government's ego structure? One way might be for UFOs to disguise themselves. \"We're friendly people, just like you,\" they could claim, \"except that we happen to be from another planet.\" As I read Leonard Stringfield's two part series on \"UFO Crash/Retrievals,\" I did not necessarily doubt his data. Instead, I found myself thinking that his report sounded more like a wreck on the Los Angeles Freeway than the story of advanced space vehicles from another world. Why are Boeing 747's safer to fly than UFOs? I found myself suspecting that all UFO crashes may be staged, as a part of the overall disguise. Whitley Strieber reports in Transfor- mation that the Visitors showed him a drawer full of apparently dead bodies, from which he concluded that they only used bodies \"as we use scuba gear to penetrate the depths of the sea\" (p. 40). This observation sug- gests that crashed UFOs, along with the dead bodies left behind, may not be proof that they are mortal, after all. Up until now, UFO research has oc- casionally reacted by denying strange evidence: right angle turns are im- possible; abductions are impossible; government involvement, and UFO crashes are impossible, and so on. We now know it is all possible. But we also have to take the next step. We have to be willing to suppose that every piece of UFO evidence could be some form of a disguise — not as a tractor, perhaps — but never- theless we must suspect all UFO revelations fall short of a full disclosure of what the reality behind the event we observe really is. Symptom of Fear A truly benevolent reality which is vastly superior to humans might realize that we need a rock to hide in We need to suppose that the terror many feel in the presence of the UFO reality may be an inevitable part of the UFO revelation experience. because if we look the UFO reality straight in the face, we may die. We need to consider the Rock of Ages Principle. We also need to suppose that the terror many feel in the presence of the UFO reality may be an inevitable part of the UFO revela- tion experience. Returning to the letter to Hopkins from England, the man's terror is a common part of the UFO abduction experience, including the religious type of abductions of Andreasson and Strieber. The man's continued terror of the space where the sighting oc- curred is also common. Biblical encounters with God were filled with terror, had spatial conse- quences, and often involved trance or sleep as a coating of insulation. Abram met God in a deep sleep, and \"a dread and great darkness fell upon him.\" (Genesis 15:12) Jacob had a dream of the angels of God ascending and descending on a ladder to heaven, and when he woke up he was afraid and said, \"How awesome is this place.\" (Genesis 28:17) He then built an altar there; the place became sacred space, a place of dread. Mt. Sinai became a holy mountain because that is where Israel had its basic UFO experience (Exodus 19-30). In our modern UFO abduc- tion cases, the place where the abduc- tion occurs, that lonely stretch of road, suddenly becomes a place of fear and awe — it becomes holy ground. I think Vallee is essentially right when he says that the UFO phenomenon is \"more complex, more interesting and more profound than any of us has ever dreamt.\" If he is right, we need to suppose that this reality is intelligent enough to know that it can only show itself to us in disguised ways without destroying us. And if UFOs are using a disguise to protect us — the Rock of Ages Principle — then we must be very careful about passing judgments on this reality that label it as either im- moral or demonic. It appears to me that the UFO reality is behaving in such a way as to communicate its presence to us, and much of its com- plexity to us, without destroying us at the same time. Furthermore, we must suppose that what is \"good\" from the point of view of UFOs might not be good from the point of view of the American government. Pharaoh probably did not have a high opinion of the \"pillar of cloud and of fire\" when it drowned his army in the Red Sea (Exodus 14:19-30). But it looked good from the Jewish point of view. Even if most students of UFOs do not accept my God Hypothesis, I believe we need to think very serious- ly about any data that indicate that UFOs often use a disguise in relating to humans. A vastly superior reality might well do this, not out of evil in- tent, but because to confront us face to face might lead to our death. We need to suspect that if some kind of UFO disguise is at work, then even if our government has crashed UFOs, and is working with live alien beings, it may still not have the full pic- ture. If we remember that our govern- ment is taking a tight security ap- proach to UFOs, that means UFOs are evaluated only on a \"need to know\" basis. Very few minds have ac- cess to the whole picture. Most of those minds would be scientific- military, not necessarily the best minds to deal with a reality which may be right in front of their eyes, but not be what they see. I remember a Roman military- political leader sending an alien Jew to the cross almost 2000 years ago because he did not understand what he was looking at. We are poised for a war of the worlds, and if there is a war, I am worried that the govern- ments of this world could again be the bad guys.

O n Saturday February 24, Dave Meyer, Adri- an Spickler and I drove to Parsons, West Vir- ginia where we met Hank Thompson, Sheriff of Tucker County. He had reported some apparent close en- counter cases to the UFO Reporting Center in Seattle a few weeks earlier and took them seriously because he knew the witnesses and judged them to be credible people. The sightings occurred on the evening of Saturday, January 27, 1990 which raised my suspicions immediately because that evening an exceptional fireball gen- erated many reports throughout the East. A Mobay Corporation chemist and laboratory foreman happened to be vacationing twelve miles east of Par- sons on this particular night, and saw the fireball through the living room window of their rented chalet. They described an exceedingly bright, blue- white oval-shaped object descending toward the southeastern horizon on a slanted, debris strewn path. The time was estimated to be sometime after 7:00 p.m. An Associated Press dispatch reported that David Arnold, an air traffic control supervisor at Dulles Airport, clocked in the sighting at 7:10 EST that evening. During the course of our afternoon in Parsons, Sheriff Thompson intro- duced us to Jimmy Roy, a local truck driver, who had a clear view of the entire sky from behind the Parsons Elementary Middle School parking lot. He described a bright oval-shaped object passing slowly from the north- east horizon (30 degrees east of north) toward the southeast (about 150 degrees). The light was com- pared in brightness and color to a welder's arc and may have taken as By Ted Spickler, Ph.D. long as 15 seconds to sweep across the sky (Arnold claimed 30 seconds). At its highest point the object was perhaps 30 degrees above the north- ern horizon. Mr. Roy expressed the opinion that he saw space junk enter- ing the atmosphere, a very reasonable assessment considering the appear- ance of the object (AP reported that NORAD was confident the object was not re-entering space junk). A few other witnesses, however, described what sounded like close en- counters with something quite unlike a distant fireball, which is the reason why we drove to Parsons. Sheriff Thompson was extremely helpful and generous with his time. He introduced us to Angie Murphy, a delightful 14-year-old daughter of Roger and Dotie Murphy, who live in a lovely ranch home in a neighborhood above and to the north of downtown Parsons. On the night in question, Mrs. Mur- phy was lying on a living room couch under a big picture window. Angie straddled a padded coffee table in front of the couch with a view to the north through the window. Across the street a mercury vapor light bathed their neighbor's house. At around 7:30 p.m., a rough estimate, Angie turned white and exclaimed amaze- ment at a bright light approaching from the distance. As it seemed to come rapidly closer, its angular size became considerably larger than the street lamp. It apparently hovered just over the house across the street. She described, and later drew, a dark football-shaped object with blue lights running across the midline. If the neighbor's compact car were hung by a crane over their house the relative size of car and object may have been the same. Within a few seconds a red light came on at one end of the thing, which then shot off quickly to the right. There was no noise and the total time for the sighting could be measured in a matter of seconds. Angie raced to another window, searching in vain for any further sign of the object. Her parents even went outside to look around. The passage of some bright lights in the sky was verified by a neighbor who lived a number of houses down the street, but who was not willing to go on record with the sighting. Aerial Football At about this same time Steve Sim- mons and Kevin Hebb were sitting in a truck alongside Route 72, facing southeast, and overlooking Parsons from about a few hundred feet above the valley. Steve was starting to pull onto the road when he caught a glimpse of a bright blue light from behind him (to the north), and as- sumed a police car was about to ap- pear over the crest of the hill. As he waited, a huge oval or football-shaped object, bright bluish-white in color, could be seen through the trees pass- ing to his left and traveling toward the valley below, looking as if it were about to plunge into the field before them. The sky lit up with sufficient brightness to reveal \"every blade of grass.\" Then in a shower of sparks, the oval appeared to change course and shoot up out of sight. They hung around for a while to see if anything else might happen, but the night was calm and they proceeded onward to a pool hall. They both estimated the inherent size of the oval as about 30 to 50 yards long, but were vague as to its apparent angular displacement. Later, Kevin talked to another witness who described what sounded like the same thing. This other sighting took place some twelve miles away at about the same time. In fact there are many witnesses describing something ranging from a bright, slow-moving star to a burned-out cinder.

Could the witnesses have really mistaken the fireball for something close to .them and therefore apparently large? A common feature of these reports is the opinion expressed by the wit- nesses that they have seen meteors before and this was certainly no meteor. The common misconception that all meteors are only \"shooting stars\" may give rise to a lack of ap- preciation for the truly awesome ap- pearance of fireballs. When a meteor is exceptionally large astronomers call it a \"fireball.\" In fact, a really spectacular fireball is quite unlike the tenuous, dim, and brief flash of a \"shooting star.\" The light from a fireball can illuminate the ground and may be many times brighter than the light from a full moon. A major fireball was studied by C.A. Chant in 1913 and his conclu- sions were re-examined in the Con- don Report (p. 579). Many witnesses to this event mistook the object as being huge and close by. They perceived the object as being some type of aircraft emitting fiery exhaust. The slow-moving horizontal trajectory added conviction to the belief they were seeing an ar- tificial flying machine. This sighting took place long before the modern era of the UFO, so their precon- ceptions centered around the \"aero- planes'\" of that period. Other studies of re-entry and space debris burn-up reveal the same pattern of credible witnesses interpreting an extraor- dinary, yet explainable, high-altitude re-entry as \"just over the hill,\" \"at tree top level,\" or \"just a few yards away\" and therefore huge. At the time of her sighting, Angle was looking toward the northeast through a window that had a thin cur- tain stretched across it. The unusual appearing light from an extraordinary fireball may have appeared distorted through the curtain, and could possibly be misperceived as close by and just over the neighbor's house. A huge oval or football- shaped object, bright bluish-white in color, could be seen through the trees passing to his left and travel- ing toward the valley below. She did not report any light from the neighbors' mercury vapor light reflect- ing from the alleged object, which is surprising considering that it was sup- posed to be hovering not far above the light. Shower of Sparks A difficult aspect of the sighting by Steve and Kevin has their object changing course and shooting up in- to the sky during a shower of sparks. This behavior was echoed by some observers reporting to the National UFO Reporting Center. Certainly these other people, a great distance removed, could not also be looking at a close encounter just over Parsons, West Virginia. Apparently, the behavior of the fireball led many witnesses to report a course change. Sometimes the physical object causing a meteor trail will skip in the Earth's atmosphere like a flat stone skipping over water. If this particular fireball also skipped it would have given the appearance of a craft changing direction and going back up into the sky. Some witnesses reported that behavior, while others gave the impression of something falling to the earth \"just over the hill.\" Steve des- cribed the object as heading for the valley floor below them as if it might crash into the ground but when asked to point to where he saw the object at its lowest altitude, his arms flailed vaguely around in the direction of the distant horizon. We suspect that the primary wit- nesses would not agree to an iden- tification of their sighting as an astronomical fireball. But considering the temporal proximity of their ex- perience with the passage of the fireball, its direction, behavior, and visual appearance, we have no real choice. The witnesses are obviously sincere and describing as accurately as they can what was perceived. Am- biguous visual information is neces- sarily processed by the mind in real time, which then tries to make sense of what is being seen. For this reason perceptions are not the same thing as observations. The witnesses can take comfort in being fortunate at having seen such an extraordinary event and having the fact of the observation verified by so many other witnesses up and down the East Coast.

Tabloids, MIB Tales From The Tabloids Like Johnny Carson, ufologists occa- sionally get into high dudgeon over the headlines in the tabloid press. Early in the month of May, I was in my neighborhood grocery when my eyes were distracted by the follow- ing front-page banner in the then cur- rent Weekly World News, the poor b&w stepchild of the National En- quirer: \"It's Alive! New Galaxy Shaped Like A Human Fetus ... and Scientists Detect a Heartbeat!\" Now, who could find any fault with that? The two-page spread, contributed by \"Special Correspondent\" Nelson Mann, occupied the rag's center-fold seat of honor. The supposed dis- coverer of the newborn galaxy — \"40 thousand light years from Earth and ... millions of miles across\" — was described as one Dr. William Radin- ski, \"whose studies of galaxies and black holes have earned him a global reputation.\" A somewhat dashing, silver-haired Radinski was pictured alongside his newfound fetal galaxy, complete with umbilical cord, rather grimly clenching a pipe stem, as might be expected of any exposed surrogate father. All we really learn about the Good Doctor Radinski is that he and \"a research team discovered the galaxy while per- forming a routine telescopic survey of the heavens from a base in Kenya on March 24.\" Radinski was quoted as saying, \"I don't think it's going too far to say that we might be witnessing the birth of a new life-form ... It could be a coin- cidence — but I doubt it.\" Well, I doubt it, too. In fact, this lat- ter gem stems from the \"fact\" that \"further study revealed that radio waves are coming from the galaxy in heartbeat-like bursts that indicate the star system may be alive.\" Go figure. More on MIB Peter Rojcewicz's profound, perceptive and thought-provoking paper invites constructive comment rather than cavilling criticism; but I feel I must question his statement that \"the prevailing position (on MIB) insists that we see anomalous beliefs as pro- ducts of cultural expectations.\" Nothing wrong about that, so far as it goes: but it seems to me Peter is telescoping two kinds of belief — the belief of the person who experiences the event from the inside, and the belief of a person who comments on it from the outside. Now each of these beliefs may be culturally conditioned, just as each may be conditioned by the psychological make-up of the in- dividual, be she/he experiencer or observer. But the two beliefs may, and most probably will, be very different. For example, my view of what hap- pened at Lourdes in 1858 is quite dif- ferent from that of Bernadette Soubirous. Whether one or other of us is justified in our belief, or whether we are both wrong, it remains true that both her beliefs and mine may be the result of cultural conditioning. I don't see how it could be otherwise, unless there exists a basis of un- disputed fact to work from. Such a basis does seem to have ex- isted in the case of the 1977 West Wales sightings, which included inter alia a fairly classic MIB incident, in which a mysterious car silently ap- peared \"from nowhere\" outside the remote farmhouse, and a weird per- son emerged with a foreign accent and \"large, penetrating blue eyes which seemed to go right through her (secondary witness Caroline Klass) and examine her thoughts.\" A series of strange incidents ensued, culminating in the car driving off and Pauline (a primary witness) arriving seconds later having met no other vehicle on the narrow farm road ... All very sinister ... except that when I re-investigated the case, Caroline was astonished when I showed her the investigators' write-up of the in- cidents. Most of them, she insisted, either hadn't happened or had been misreported: for example, the reason why Pauline hadn't passed the strange car was simply that Caroline had pointed out to the driver a short cut to where he wanted to go, by a track through the fields rather than the farm road ... I n short, there was a real enough event at bottom of the tale: but the 'MIB' elements had been grafted onto the base material, con- sciously or unconsciously, by the investigators. Far be it from me to suggest that this happens in every case, and the Yates case which Peter cites may be a happening of a more complex kind. If so, Peter's 'crack area' model would be a convenient means of putting such cases on hold pending further understanding of them: but while I ap- plaud his initiative in creating a pigeonhole into which we can put these kinds of events, I feel that the classification can only be provisional, and that in the end we shall have to decide between consensus reality and subjective fantasy. For the question remains in, say, the Yates case: given the 'real' basis, where did the 'unreal' elements come from? Was there a third party, a trickster playing games with Yates, with the police and everyone in- volved? Or was it the mind of Yates, projecting outwardly some inward preoccupation? Or was everyone con- cerned the victim of cultural forces? Someone, somewhere, has to be responsible. Finding out who, seems to me to be the one essential ques- tion we should be asking. — Hilary Evans MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 Current Case Log Dan Wright, Investigations The following summarizes case reports received in April 1990. which are well documented and represent recent events of significance to ufology. Unless noted, no sound, vibration or odor was detected in the incidents described. • Log #900401: 1/12/90. 1 a.m. event near Underwood. Indiana, in- vestigator Jim Delehanty. A woman was watching TV when she noticed bright lights through a window. Pro- ceeding to another room for a better view, she discerned perhaps 500 yards distant two round lights on either side of a smaller hemispherical red light. An undefined dark probe extended from one side. Momentarily, five or six iden- tical sets joined the first, each about 100 feet above the ground. After hovering for approximately 10 minutes, all quickly departed. • Log #900402: 2/22/90, 5:30 p.m. event near Henryville, Indiana, investigator Jim Delehanty. A teenage girl home alone heard a strong wind outside. [A weather station check afterward revealed a wind speed of 7 mph in the area.] From a window, she spotted a bright silvery disc less than 100 yards away and hovering over trees that were swaying seemingly from a force emanating from the ob- ject. Within two minutes, the vehicle moved laterally over a mobile home, then ascended out of sight. The equi- hemispherical disc was further described as having numerous steady white lights which (from a lateral perspective) appeared to extend around the top and bottom. The fami- ly dog howled and whined through- out and had little appetite over the next few days. • Log #900403: 3/4/90. 10:10 p.m. event near New Albany. Indiana, in- vestigator Jim Delehanty. Two men were driving when they noticed something rise up from behind a stand of trees in the distance. Stop- ping the car, they witnessed a stingray-shaped object which even- tually passed directly overhead at 1,000-1,500 feet altitude and 100-150 mph. The vehicle was described as a \"wedge\" or \"flying wing,\" much wider than a 747 jetliner and with a short pointed tail at the rear. The underside was composed of numerous rec- tangular panels. An amber light was visible at one wingtip, a blue light at the other, and a pink-orange light at the front. An oscillating sound (remindful of a blank audiocassette on fast forward) was detected. The dura- tion was estimated as four minutes. • Log #900406: 1/27/90. 9:50 p.m. event in Harrison City, Penn- sylvania, investigator Wayne Willis. Driving along the main steet of a small town, a woman observed a 30-50 foot disc hovering 150-200 feet above and in front of her. She stopped for a better look, noting the underside's metallic brown exterior, perhaps four tight concentric circles of blue-green lights, and an undefined appendage hanging down. After one-to-two min- utes, the object moved off in a southerly direction and was quickly lost from view. • Log #900408: 3/7/90. 2 a.m. event in Gulf Breeze. Florida, in- vestigator Joe Barren. A woman was feeding her infant when she noticed a beam of white light, approximately three feet in diameter, descend to the ground just beyond the window. In two seconds, the light disappeared. During its presence, she detected a slight vibration of unknown source. The following morning, the woman's husband discovered a circle of burned grass 11 feet in diameter near the win- dow. Along with the woman's parents, they detected a strong \"perfume\" odor emanating from the scorched area. • Log #900409: 2/28/90, 11:30 p.m. event in Gulf Breeze, Florida, in- vestigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. While driving, two women noticed a cluster of red and white lights hover- ing low over a nearby store. As they turned onto the adjoining street for a closer view, an undefined form en- compassing the lights glided slowly overhead and into the distance. Two bright spotlights were illuminated for seconds, then extinguished before the object was lost from view. • Log #900410: 10/4/89, 2:40- 5:00 p.m. near Ipava, Illinois, in- vestigator Poe Clark. The investigator heard a low-flying military jet ap- proaching and so reached for binoculars to follow its path as routine observational practice. Moments later, he spotted at an altitude of 10,000 feet three white spherical objects con- nected by thin, white flexible strands and drifting slowly across the sky. Within minutes, he noticed an amor- phous white form, also at high altitude and perhaps 50 feet in diameter, con- sisting of a cotton-like substance. Myriad small particles of this drifted to the ground over a wide area. Three days later, in the company of an additional investigator, many more linked spherical objects were observed, moving in all directions and expelling the same white substance. Also seen were a large silver-grey, cigar-shaped object and a smallish white, egg-shaped object, both in ver- tical orientation; a rotating white oblong/cylindrical object; silver spheres; a wavering, red diamond- shaped object; dark brown discs with an appendage from the underside; and a slender white boomerang- shaped object which rotated while in motion. Dozens of the \"angel hair\" samples were collected. Three of these were MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 sent to a commercial laboratory. Spectral analysis indicated that \"the material is organic and of a composi- tion similar to amino acids.\" The lab report further related \"strong similarities between the FTIR spectra of these unknown materials and similar spectra of a spider's web.\" • Log #900416: 3/20/90, 9 p.m. event near Carney, Oklahoma, in- vestigator Jean Waller. A woman, along with three adolescents, were driving home on a rural road when approached from behind by a beam of dark red light estimated as perhaps 50 feet in diameter and hundreds of feet high. They stopped and departed the car, at which point the column of red likewise halted over an adjoining field. Due to its brilliance and height, the source above could not be discerned. As they re-entered their vehicle, two or more white conical beams ap- peared within the red column. Then they realized several apparent E-M ef- fects: Spontaneously, their auto's ceil- ing dome light, windshield wipers, emergency flashers, and radio dial light (which had not shown for years) were operating, and the interior generally felt uncomfortably warm to all. Unable to reverse any of these ef- fects, they continued homeward a few miles distant, paced by the anomaly. Upon their arrival, they yelled for the father as the column of light halted just across the road. He arrived out- side in time to see the display recede into the distance until lost from view. Total duration was estimated as 20 minutes. • Log #900419: 3/2/90, 11 p.m. event beginning near Beavercreek, Il- linois, investigator Don Krieger. A couple was driving through the coun- tryside on their way home when they spotted a brilliant, rapidly pulsating white oval next to the road perhaps a mile ahead. Initially assuming it to be a powerline discharge, they were perplexed when after five-to-six miles they had not overtaken it. The light then moved directly over the road and hovered. Momentarily, they ap- proached and stopped just short and 30 feet below it. Amid the intense glow was an undefined dark form. Directly underneath was a tapered cylindrical object. This appeared refrigerator- sized, one end obscured by the brightness above. The visible portion of its surface appeared dark brown, with at least two narrow bands of lighter brown. A small bubble-like dome extended from the underside. The cylinder \"jumped\" to a posi- tion directly over them and cast a 20-30 foot white beam of steady strength over the truck and roadway. The couple sped away, the dual anomalies following closely behind. At one point, the unknowns seeming- ly anticipated their turn onto an in- tersecting road, crossing diagonally over a field to rejoin them. As they approached the next town, the objects withdrew and moved erratically in the distance. The pulsating glow re- mained visible in the distance for several miles farther until finally lost from view. Total duration was estimated as 20 minutes. • Log #900421: 4/5/90, 8:15 p.m. event in Gulf Breeze, Florida, in- vestigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A man was driving eastbound near the bay when he noticed, perhaps two miles ahead, what at first appeared to be a jet fighter in a flat spin and about to crash. At that moment, two military jets approached from the north, and the first object immediately shot lateral- ly southward, halting one-to-two miles distant. The witness pulled off and departed his car. The object, depicted as a domed disc, proceeded to rise slowly beyond a treeline. It was further described as having a white body, with red and green lights spaced evenly around the side, and an unlit dome at the top. The witness retreated to a phone, beckoning a friend and the in- vestigators (who are acquaintances) and also calling the sheriff's depart- ment, which dispatched two deputies. The additional witnesses, upon their arrival, were able to distinguish a bright light many thousands of feet high which, over the course of two hours, continued to ascend slowly and at variance with the motion of referenced stars in the same section of the sky. • Log #900422: 3/2/88, 10 p.m. event in Gulf Breeze, Florida, in- vestigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A woman glanced out a window, see- ing a 20-foot, dark oval-shaped ob- ject passing slowly through a wooded area adjoining her property. She ran outside and noted evenly spaced, round yellow-white lights along its near side. She expressed amazement later that the vehicle did not impact with the tightly situated trees as it con- tinued its straight-line path through the woods and into the night. Dura- tion was estimated as five minutes. • Log #900422: 11/30/89, 9:45 p.m. and 10:15 p.m. events in Gulf Breeze, Florida, investigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. The same witness as above was driving eastbound near the bay when she noticed a bright light approaching from the northwest. She parked alongside the road and observed a dark \"arrowhead\" shaped object, the size of a light aircraft, rapid- ly descend and hover 100 feet away next to a power substation. From the object's underside shown 30 or more small white lights that covered the sur- face excepting a centered circular por- tion. Three intensely bright lights came on. She drove across the road and onto the substation driveway, at which point the vehicle receded rapidly. The witness tried unsuccessfully to follow the object, then turned toward home. Along an unpopulated area she spotted ahead of her the same or an identical object (save the three spotlights) at treetop level and ap- proaching at jogging speed. She again stopped the car and watched it cross her path 40-50 feet away. As she turned her car around to follow it, the \"arrowhead\" accelerated rapidly, ex- ecuted a sharp turn and climbed quickly out of sight.

The pilot. Captain William Sperry, described what he saw: \"The object was flying head-on at us. It was 50 times the magnitude of the brightest star. I immediately made an abrupt turn to avoid colli- sion. As I looked to my left the ob- ject appeared to come to a stop. It ap- peared as a perfectly streamlined ob- ject without wings or tail section as it was silhouetted against the full moon. \"At all times it had a brilliant shim- mering blue light in the nose. It was traveling at fantastic speeds, and although it had passed off our left wing tip it circled us in a matter of seconds and appeared off our right wing. There again it stopped, and we watched it for several seconds. When again it started, it reversed its direc- tion. We watched it for several more seconds until it disappeared in the east out of sight. I have never seen anything like it before or since.\" Cap- tain Sperry had flown for American Airlines for 17 years with more than 15,000 hours' flying time. Following widespread publicity about the UFO encounter. Captain Sperry heard from a pilot by the name of Henry H. Myers (President Franklin Roosevelt's personal pilot during World War II), who had been flying another American Airlines' plane over Virginia some 400 miles to the south the same night. Myers noticed a brilliant light at the same time as Sperry's sighting. The light had dropped down out of the night sky to his north, where Sperry's plane was at the time. To Myers' astonishment, the light fell a distance, leveled off, then moved away in horizontal flight. H 1955 The London Sunday Dis- patch for the first of the month reported, \"The Air Ministry stated that the results of their five year investiga- tion of UFOs is not to be made public. It is to be locked away and may not ever be released, for the Air Ministry is afraid it will encounter or promote much scepticism.\" This announce- ment was followed by another story, cabled to America through the Inter- national News Service's London office by Dorothy Killgellan, a staff cor- respondent for the New York Journal- American. \"London, May 22 — I can report today on a story which is positively spooky, not to mention chilling. British scientists and airmen, after examining the wreckage of one mysterious flying ship, are convinced these strange aerial objects are not op- tical illusions or Soviet inventions, but are flying objects which originate on another planet. \"The source of my information is a British official of Cabinet rank who prefers to remain unidentified. 'We believe, on the basis of our inquiry thus far, that the UFOs were staffed by small men — probably under four feet tall. It's frightening, but there is no denying the UFOs come from another planet.' This official quoted scientists as saying a ship of this type could not have possibly been con- structed on Earth. The British Gov- ernment, I learned, is withholding an official report on the UFO examina- tion at this time, possibly because it does not wish to frighten the public.\" • While the Killgellan story was be- ing both officially and unofficially denied by the Defense Ministry in London, the sighting of a silvery, cigar-shaped craft by the crew of a Portuguese Air Lines Skymaster bound for London from Lisbon on the 25th, was widely reported by the British press. The crew said it had no wings, and was moving at terrific speed. It was long and slim, and seemed to be revolving as it passed under the nose of the airliner. The flight engineer, Jose Eliva, said: \"The object seemed to approach from the port side and pass right under the nose. To me it looked like a silver cigar. There was no smoke trail com- ing from it.\" The British Air Ministry reported that the object was a child's balloon accidentally released from the Dorking area. • 1960 A mysterious triangular- shaped object was sighted on the 22nd by astronomers at an obser- vatory at Palma on the Spanish island of Majorca. The object spun on its own axis without deviating from its path and appeared about the size of a quarter-moon. It was seen for two minutes. Its velocity, altitude and lack of noise or tail ruled out its being a jet aircraft or a balloon, an observatory spokesman said. • 1965 While standing watch at 1:10 a.m. aboard a navy ship in the Philippine Sea on the fifth, a signal- man using binoculars sighted three objects in close proximity to each other; one object was first magnitude; the other two, second magnitude. The objects were traveling at extremely high speed, moving toward the ship at an undetermined altitude. Four minutes later, four moving targets were detected on the air search radar at ranges up to 22 miles and held for up to six minutes. Over the ship the objects spread to a circular formation and remained there for about three minutes. This maneuver was observed both visually and by radar. The bright object which hovered off the starboard quarter made a larger presentation on the radar scope. The objects made several course changes during the sighting, con- firmed visually and by radar, and were MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"19 tracked at speeds in excess of 3000 knots. Challenges were made by IFF but were not answered. After the three minute hovering maneuver, the objects moved in a southeasterly direction at an extremely high rate of speed. The entire aerial display was observed by the commanding officer, all personnel on the bridge, and numerous personnel working topside. Air Force Project Blue Book identified the objects as \"aircraft.\" • About 3:25 a.m. on the 28th, an Australian DC-6 operated at Ansett- A.N.A., was on a regular flight from Brisbane, Australia to Port Moresby, New Guinea, when a spheroid- shaped craft made a close pass at the aircraft. The airliner captain, using a call sign of \"VH-INH,\" radioed a Queensland airport control tower that the DC-6 was being \"buzzed\" by an unknown flying object. He described it as a sphere, flat on the top and the bottom. For ten minutes the vehicle paced the airliner, during which time the captain took several photographs of the mystery craft. The captain was instructed not to have the film developed in New Guinea. On his return trip he was flown to Canberra where the film was taken from him. The 12-hour tapes with the pilot's report to the control tower also were confiscated. • 1975 Three disc-shaped craft took control of a single-engine plane near Mexico City, Mexico, said the young pilot who admitted: \"I was so scared I was crying.\" For 10 horrowing minutes, beginning at 11:30 a.m. on the third, 23-year-old Carlos Antonio de los Santos Monteil reported he was surrounded by UFOs — one on each wingtip and the other beneath him — on a flight from Zihuatanejo to Mex- ico City. And when the incredible craft finally departed, two of them made an impossibly sharp high-speed turn, baffling air traffic controllers who were tracking them on radar. De los Santos — with three years and 370 flying hours experience — estimated the vehicles were 12 feet in diameter and five feet thick. He said they were dark gray and had a dome- like area with what looked like an antenna sticking up from the center. \"I was terrified ... and I was crying. I could hardly talk,\" he said. As his air- craft approached a regular navigation checkpoint about 50 miles south of Mexico City at 15,000 feet, the pilot made the following recorded radio call to \"Centro Mexico\" — Mexico City's air traffic control center: \"Emergen- cy! Emergency! ... Three unidentified but visual flying objects are around my plane. The plane is not under my con- trol ...\" De los Santos said two of the craft took up positions \"just inches\" from his wingtips, while the third seemed to bump his plane from underneath. \"There were mechanical sounds like the sounds in a garage,\" he remem- bered. He said he could not control his altitude or turn the plane. Then to his horror the plane began to climb, escorted by the disc-like objects. \"I'm going up!\" he shouted into the radio. I'm now at 15,000 feet and I still can't control the plane ...\" The radio went silent for several minutes. Suddenly it cracked and the pilot's voice, with a sigh of relief, said: \"I now have con- trol of the plane ... Both discs are off to the right now. They're headed toward the mountains ... I can't see the third one.\" Centro Mexico air traffic controller Emilio Estanol, watching a radar screen, recalled that \"The objects made a 270-degree turn at 518 mph in an arc of only three miles. Normally a plane moving at that speed needs eight to 10 miles to make a turn like that. In my 17 years as an air traffic controller I've never seen anything like that. There were no other flights in the area, not even training flights.\" After De los Santos reported that his land- ing gear didn't work, an emergency was declared and Mexico City Inter- national Airport was closed to all traf- fic for 35 minutes. But after several passes he managed to get the land- ing gear into a \"down\" position and landed his plane safely. (Editor's note: Walt Andrus personally interviewed De los Santos in Acapulco, Mexico in 1975.) • 1980 On the seventh, the pilot of a KLM (Dutch) airliner was flying at 10,000 meters over the Dachstein Mountains, Austria. The time was ap- proximately 3:50 p.m. Suddenly, the pilot saw a grey, spherical-shaped object flying overhead, and he im- mediately reported this to the Air Control Center in Vienna. In turn the ACC contacted the military head- quarters of the Austrian Air Force. The officer in command at that time, Major Carl Schwarz, ordered three Saab-Draken 105s to take off and in- tercept. Once visual contact was made, two of the 105s attempted to intercept while the third had the task of taking as much film footage of the object as possible. The craft's erratic maneuvers and speed made it im- possible for the aircraft to follow, and it was soon out of sight. Approximately two hours later, at 5:30 p.m., a German aircraft belong- ing to the Lufthansa airline came in- to close contact with a similar object. Although there was no radar contact, Major Schwarz ordered two Saab- Draken jets scrambled, and another attempted intercept was under way. Commenting on the pursuit, one of the pilots said: \"We were operating at a height of 12,000 meters. The 'thing' was flying very fast, and then very slow. It seemed to be playing with us. The UFO was flying 3000 meters over us, and although we tried all possible maneuvers, we couldn't catch it.\" As for the film record of the first in- tercept, the only comment came from a Major Wolfgang Brauner, at military headquarters, who said \"... the films are useless.\" What was his explana- tion for the craft that out-maneuvered experienced pilots and their excellent aircraft? Major Brauner believes it was a ... balloon! Until a reporter heard about the incident the case was kept \"hushed up\" but, under pressure, the few details above were given to the press.

Spencer, Harpenden, England There have been several impressive attempts over the years to produce the blueprints of a flying saucer and this book by John Ackerman must rate as one of the best of an already impressive list. The book is of course highly scien- tific, with most of the detail passing over my head - and I suspect many readers' heads - and for that reason it would be useful to see it reviewed by Mr. Ackerman's peers. However, this does not detract the reader from the book as it very sensibly ties together the scientific theory with reported UFO observations and even some aspects of what could loosely be called the 'mythology of UFOs.' Two questions came to mind with regard to Mr. Ackerman's arguments: 1. Mr. Ackerman argues that we may be discussing the technologies of a civilization perhaps 100,000 years ahead of our own and reminds us that our own sophisticated technology has only evolved over the last 200 years. In a later part of the book he then sug- gests that we have observed different shapes of flying saucers and that these may represent advances and modifications in their craft as time pro- gresses. I think the analogy is akin to exposing a Neanderthal man to the automobile age and expecting him to spot the difference between a 1970 model and a 1975 model vehicle and I doubt that that would be possible. (However, there are differences observed and that does need to be ex- plained somehow! So, we would not be right to reject out of hand Mr. Ackerman's suggestion.) 2. Mr. Ackerman's theories very neatly tie up the activities of flying saucers on the basis of our present day understanding of technology with reasonable latitude for advances that we have not ourselves yet made. Again, I have some doubts about the logic of this, in that I do not feel we would be in a position to even com- ment on the technology of a civiliza- tion 100,000 years more advanced than our own any more than our sug- gested Neanderthal man could com- bine his own knowledge of his own world with even the most keen obser- vation of our world, and come up with a reasonable working model of a microwave oven, automobile, etc. But I am the first to admit that these amount to nitpicking, and in any case do not detract from the very worth- while effort of an attempt to under- stand this puzzling enigma of UFOs. I am also delighted to find that such an elaborate effort has been made by a physicist/engineer. It is very impor- tant that all attempts by all persuasions are made to understand this pheno- menon so that eventually the truth can be understood by an amalgam of those efforts. There is a great deal of effort, particularly in Europe, to understanding the sociological, mythological and psychological aspects of the subject - indeed I am one of those who concentrates his ef- forts mostly on these areas - and we must never lose sight of the fact that there are certain hard, physical aspects to the subject, which need to be addressed by those qualified to do so. In summary then I believe this is a well written and well approached book, which should be on the bookshelves of - and read by - all serious ufologists.

Webb June 1990 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter, in Gemini below Pollux and Castor, lies low above the western horizon, shining at magnitude -1.8. In mid-June the celestial giant sets in the NW about 9:45 PM daylight time. By month's end the setting time has decreased even farther to about 9, only half an hour after sunset. The planet is near the thin crescent Moon on the 23rd. Saturn (magnitude 0.2), in Sagittarius, now rises in the ESE about 10 PM in midmonth. It advances westward in the southern sky throughout the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): At dawn Venus (-3.9), Mars (0.4), and Saturn remain low in the east (the first two objects) and in the SSW (the ringed planet). Mars actually rises about 1:30 AM and Venus about 3 AM in mid-June. Saturn lies near the waning gibbous Moon on the llth. Moon Phases: Full moon — June 8 O Last quarter — June 16 New moon — June 22 First quarter — June 29 C The Stars: At 11 PM a nosediving Leo the Lion in the west begins to signal the end of spring, while the summer sky symbol, the Summer Triangle, dominates the opposite half of the heavens. Early cultures noticed that the planets always moved close to the 'yearly path of the Sun through the stars. This apparent path is called the ecliptic (where eclipses of the Sun and Moon occur) and is centered within a belt of constellations 16° wide — the zodiac. The planets never stray beyond this zone (with the possible exception of Pluto). The reason the Sun and planets appear to ride along in similar paths is because as we look across Earth's orbit, we also are peering across the plane of the solar system. All of the planets revolve around the Sun close to this same plane. (Pluto and Mercury depart the most from the ecliptic.) Of the 12 \"signs of the zodiac,\" those visible late on a June evening, from west to east, are Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius and Sagittarius. The last is Saturn's current location. Virgil C.

In this regard, John W. Komar, State Director for Tennessee, has been ex- perimenting for a few months with \"MUFONET\" Message Echo, along with MUFON members in Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Nevada and Ten- nessee. Anyone interested in such a network or seeking information con- cerning MUFONET should write to Mr. Komar at 4769 Lake Ridge Drive, Memphis, TN 38109 or contact him on his voice line (901) 785-4819 or the data number (901) 785-4943. Readers will be kept abreast of the progress of MUFONET, as it matures. Computer Input Form 2 All MUFON Field Investigator's Manuals (third edition) mailed after April 1, 1990 have the new Com- puter Input Form 2 (3 pages) and the 11-page \"Instructions for Completion\" enclosed. Anyone desiring to update their manual should write to MUFON by postcard or letter, requesting same. Rocky Mountain Conference The llth Annual Rocky Mountain Conference on UFO Investigation will be held June 28, 29 and 30, 1990 at the School of Extended Studies, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY, conducted by June O. Parnell, Ph.D. and R. Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D. The pur- pose of the conference is to provide an opportunity for UFO experiencers and UFO investigators to become ac- quainted and to share information about UFO experiences. Speakers scheduled and workshop leaders on June 29 and 30 are Marilyn J. Sprinkle, Penny Goodson-Kjome, Jane A.

The Fund for UFO Research will provide a $500 cash award to the recipient. The following people have been nominated for this prestigious award by the MUFON Board of Directors, listed alphabetically: Charles D. Flan- nigan, Stan Gordon, Richard H. Hall, Ed and Frances Walters, and Dan Wright. A ballot is enclosed with this issue of the Journal so all members and subscribers may vote for their choice from the candidates proposed. All ballots must be returned to MUFON in Seguin, Texas by Satur- day, June 16, 1990 so adequate time is allowed for engraving the plaque. National UFO Information Week The Sixth National UFO Informa- tion Week has been scheduled for August 12-19, 1990. This will be an ideal opportunity for State and State Section groups to set up photo ex- hibits, displays, booths for receiving UFO sighting reports from the public and closed circuit TV showing of UFO documentaries, etc. in shopping malls and libraries. Advance planning is re- quired in order to reserve space in these facilities and to construct the ex- hibits and displays. Marge Christensen, Director of Public Education, heartily endorses this pro- gram in order to take advantage of the resurging interest in UFOs by the public, printed media and television. New Officers Virgil C. Staff, M.A., presently a State Section Director living in Berkeley, California, has been pro- moted to State Director for Northern California by Paul C. Cerny, Western Regional Director, replacing Marvin E. Taylor, Jr. who recently resigned. Mr. Staff joined MUFON in 1978. Mrs. Anna Gloria Colon, Puerto Rico State Director, has appointed Jorge Martin, editor of the UFO magazine Enigma, as her Assistant State Director. Charles D.

MUFON 1990 Symposium The theme for the MUFON 1990 International UFO Symposium in Pensacola, Florida is \"UFOs: The Im- pact of ET. Contact Upon Society.\" It will convene on the weekend of Ju- ly 6, 7 and 8 at the beautiful Pen- sacola Hilton Hotel, only a few miles from the Gulf Breeze Sightings that have continued for over two years.

Flannigan, State Director; Carol and Rex Salisberry, Co-State Sec- tion Directors; and Donald M. Ware, Eastern Regional Director. The speaking program agenda is listed separately in this issue of the Continued on page 23 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 265 May 1990"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"23 MESSAGE, Continued Journal. A \"Get Acquainted\" Recep- tion with hors d'oeuvres will be held Friday evening, July 6, from 6 to 9 p.m. Cost: $5 per person before June 1; advance reservations are required. A cash bar will be available. The ad- vance registration fee for all five speaking sessions is $35.00 before June 1 and $40 thereafter. Individual sessions will be on a space available basis at $10 per person per session, paid at the door. A chartered bus tour of UFO sites in the Gulf Breeze area is scheduled for Sunday morning, July 8 from 8:30 to 10:00 a.m. Advance reservations for the bus tour are required; bus fee: $12 per person before June 1st. (Two buses have already been sold out and more are available.) Delta Airlines is the official airline for the 1990 Symposium. Delta is of- fering 40% off regular coach fares and 5% off their lowest available fare. Seniors (age 62 and older) get an ad- ditional 10% off the lowest available fare. To get these discounts, you must call: 1-800-768-5463; ask for Reagan or Sue at Gulf Breeze Travel and tell them that you are coming to the MUFON Symposium. Since only a limited number of seats at these prices are allocated on each flight, the airline tickets have been selling fast.

Other events scheduled include the following: Press Conference on Fri- day, July 6 at 1:30 p.m. for the speakers who have already arrived. Dan Wright is moderating the annual State and Asst. State Directors meeting (or their authorized represen- tatives) on Friday, July 6 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The four Regional Directors will also preside. The Annual MUFON Corporate Board of Directors Meeting will be held Sunday morning, July 8th from 9 a.m. till noon. Donald M. Ware, Eastern Regional Director, has scheduled a closed meeting (by invita- tion only) for Monday, July 9th. All MUFON Board of Directors who can stay over another day are invited. Western Regional Director Election The second term of Paul C. Cer- ny, the present Western Regional Director on the MUFON Board of Directors, will soon expire according to corporate bylaws. Filling this impor- tant position for the western states is a unique opportunity for a person with leadership abilities, dedication to resolving the UFO phenomenon, and time resources. Experience as a State or State Section Director are valuable attributes, however enthusiasm and available time are significant assets to fulfill this prestigious position. Since this is a volunteer job, anyone in- terested in being considered should write to Walt Andrus expressing their interest, desire and qualifications. An election will be conducted by ballot by the members of the western states of WA, OR, CA, ID, NV, UT, AZ, MT, WY, CO, NM, AK, HI and Guam. Obviously, the candidates must reside in one of these states. Stanton T. Friedman Elected to MUFON Board By official action of the MUFON Board of Directors at the 1988 annual corporate meeting, Ted R. Phillips was removed from the Board as Specialization Coordinator and assigned to the MUFON Staff for Physical Trace Research. In a letter to all Board of Directors on March 2, 1990, the MUFON Executive Com- mittee proposed and nominated Stanton T. Friedman, M.S. to be- come a member of the Board of Directors with the title of \"Director of Special Investigations.\" ft was felt that Mr. Friedman would add stature to the scientific credibility of the MUFON Board of Directors. His reputation in Ufology and record of accomplish- ments speaks for itself. Based upon the tabulation of affir- mative ballots returned by Board Members, it is with extreme pleasure that Stanton T Friedman is welcomed to the MUFON Board of Directors. We look forward to many more years of close association with Mr. Fried- man, who has contributed numerous articles to the MUFON UFO Journal and has been a featured speaker at more annual MUFON symposia than anyone during the past 21 years. Paranet Overview Mike Corbin, administrator of PARANET, has moved his head- quarters from Colorado to Las Vegas, Nevada. Paranet's mailing address is P.O. Box 97797, Las Vegas, NV 89193-7797; Voice line (714) 624-2051 and Data line: none at pre- sent. Paranet was started in 1983 as a loosely-knit group of privately own- ed bulletin boards (BBS), with no financial charges to callers accessing the BBS. At present, Paranet includes approximately 24 BBS's operating within the U.S.A., 13 in Australia and six in Europe. The original concept of Paranet was in the area of paranormal activities and UFOs. Paranet is comprised of three areas of operation: (1) Message Bases, (2) File Areas, and (3) In- vestigative Activity. The main activity is within the message bases. Users access same thru the various Paranet boards. A user can receive and reply to messages. File Areas are text files, mostly compiled by Users and Paranet SysOps, and cover a variety of topics. As for Investigative Activity, there does not presently exist within Paranet a viable framework of investigators. UFO investigations, on rare occasions, are handled by a Paranet SysOp, but the majority of in-depth investigative reports are generated from outside of Paranet. Limited in-depth reports come from the administrative staff. MUFON members and subscribers, who own personal computers and modems, are invited to participate in the Paranet operations.
