Today, UFO research has become highly specialized. There are books on ab- ductions, books on UFO propulsion sys- tems, books on the government cover-up and so forth. One aspect that has been largely ignored, however, is the positive medical effects of UFO encounters, in other words, UFO healings. UFO healings are nothing new. In fact, virtually every major UFO investigator has uncovered these types of cases. Budd Hopkins, John Mack, MD, and David Jacobs, Ph.D., arguably the three leading abduction investigators, all admit that ex- traterrestrials apparently heal people. Says Budd Hopkins: \"The question is whether we hear about healing cases. We do sometimes, very rarely, but they do turn up. And we don't know what to make of them. It's kind of a sad thing because I have some abductees who have serious medical prob- lems who wish they were being healed themselves, but are not... so we don't know. Incidentally, again, there's no evidence whatsoever that this is a malevolent, evil conspiracy going on in the sky against us, they're going to take us over, or anything else. I'm very optimistic about the outcome because they seem to be most interested in what I consider the most lovely aspects of being human...There's no evidence, how- ever, that they're here to help us. We wouldn't perhaps have AIDS and the hole in the ozone layer and everything else if they were here to help us. So there's no sense to this.\" Says David Jacobs, Ph.D.: \"In extremely rare cases, the aliens will undertake a cure of some ailment troubling the abductee. This is not in any way related to the con- tactee/Space Brother concepts of benevo- lent aliens coming to Earth to cure cancer. Rather, in special circumstances, it appears that aliens feel obliged to preserve the specimen for their own purposes. As one abductee said, 'It's equipment mainte- nance.'\" Says John Mack, MD: \"Some encounters are more sinister, traumatizing and mysteri- ous. Others seem to bear a healing and edu- cation[al] intent... many abductees have ex- perienced or witnessed healing conditions ranging from minor wounds to pneumonia, childhood leukemia, and even in one case reported to me first-hand, the overcoming of muscular atrophy in a leg related to po- liomyelitis.\" As can be seen from the numbers, the healing of an illness is not a consistently re- ported symptom of a UFO encounter. Still, Brad Steiger, Richard Boylan, Ph.D., John Carpenter, Antonio Huneeus, Ralph & Judy Blum, James Harder, PhD., Jim & Coral Lorenzen, Kevin Randle, William Hamilton, Jacques Vallee, Michael Hessemann, Timothy Green Beckley and Leonard Stringfield are all well-known UFO re- searchers who have investigated UFO heal- ing cases. Edith Fiore, Ph.D., says that fully one half of her clients have experienced UFO healings. E xactly how many people experience UFO healings? We can only make ap- proximations based on the reported cases. The first clue comes from Thomas E. Bullard and his massive volume, UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery. Of the 270 abduction accounts in his study, there were thirteen cases of UFO healings. In other words, 4% of all abductees re- ported a healing. According to Bullard, \"The other and more cheerful side of per- manent aftereffects are the 13 instances where the witness left the abduction healed of some ailment... many of the cures ap- pear to result from deliberate intervention whereas the harmful effects could be acci- dental.\" A further refinement of Bullard's study comes from Dan Wright, manager of the MUFON Abduction Transcription Project. According to the preliminary statistical Dennett, a MUFON field investigator, received his BA in English from California State University of Northridge. He has writ- ten more than 50 arti- cles and four UFO books. His previous Journal arti- cles include: • UFO: Don't Shoot! March, 1993 • One in Forty June, 1990 October 1996 Number 342 Pages"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL UFO Healings: True Accounts of People Healed by UFOs Preston Dennett Wild Flower Press Illus., $13.95 1-800366- 0264 • Case 17 Let's Face the Facts About Flying Saucers, by Gabriel Green & Warren Smith, NY, Popular Library, 1967, pp. 85-86. • Case 07 Personal files analysis, 11% (4 cases) of physiological ef- fects caused by UFOs are healing cases. T hat people claim extraterrestrial cures shouldn't be all that surprising, given that the central feature of most abduction accounts is a probing medical examination. Indeed, by reviewing the existing UFO and abduction literature, I've managed to turn up more than a hundred healing cases, which I detail in my new book, UFO Healings: True Accounts of People Healed by Extraterrestrials. Ailments allegedly healed or cured range from the common cold to cancer. What follows is but a partial list of some of the healings reported by UFO witnesses or abductees: Aneurysm Angioma Arthritis Asthma Back Pain Burns Cancer Candidiasis Cold Diphtheria Fever Flesh Wounds Heart Condition Infertility Kidney Disease Liver Disease Multiple Sclerosis Muscular Dystrophy Myopia Paralysis Pneumonia Polio Rheumatism Tuberculosis Tumors Warts October 1996 Number 342 Page 4 Of the 105 cures reported, 24 (22%) in- volve healings of flesh wounds and injuries, 16 (15%) involve healings of minor ill- nesses and ailments, 7 (7%) involve eye cures, 4 (4%) involve cures of the integu- mentary system, 6 (6%) involve kidney and liver cures, 6 (6%) involve lung cures, 31 (30%) involve cures of serious and/or chronic illnesses, and 11 (10%) involve can- cer cures. There are several well-known cases of UFO healings in the literature in which no apparent abduction was involved. The fol- lowing (my case numbers) is certainly one of the most curious: CASE #017: On September 3, 1965, two police officers, Patrol Deputy Robert W. Goode and Chief Deputy Billy McCoy were driving along Highway 36 South in Damon, Texas. The two officers were returning from a high school football game. Deputy Goode was suffering from a painful although minor injury. He had been bitten on the left index finger by his son's pet baby alligator. The finger was red and swollen. Suddenly, Chief Deputy McCoy saw strange lights rising from the right side of the road. He pulled the patrol car off the road and pointed out the lights to Deputy Goode. When Goode looked, he too saw the lights. At this point, the lights moved to- wards the police officers. They weren't able to see any detail until the lights were very close, at which time a beam of light shope down on the officers. As McCoy says, \"The inside of the car was lit up by the bright light.\" Goode's left arm with his injured finger was hanging outside the window when the beam struck. As Goode says, \"I could feel the heat from the light. We got out of there.\" It was shortly after they left the area that Goode noticed that his finger was no longer throbbing with pain. As he says, \"I suddenly realized it was not bothering me and I pulled off the bandage. Hell, you couldn't tell I had ever been bit.\" McCoy verified Goode's story, saying, \"The swelling had disappeared and the fin- ger looked a lot better.\" There are many other very well-known cases, including an anonymous French doc- tor who was cured of a flesh wound on his ankle and partial paralysis; an anonymous Peruvian official who was cured of rheuma- tism and myopia; an Argentinean who grew a new set of teeth after his encounter, and the daughter of a Brazilian official who was cured of cancer. Interestingly, in each case the witness was cured by an unusual beam of light. However, rather than cover additional cases which have already been widely pub- licized, I will concentrate on those that have received little or no publicity. CASE #007: involves a four-year-old girl from southern California. The case occurred in the early 1950s. Details were uncovered through hypnotic regression, conducted by therapist and UFO investigator Barbara Lamb, MS, MFCC. According to Lamb, \"She had an experience at age four where she was sexually abused by her grandfather, and there was actually some physical dam- age done to her in her genital area because of that. And fortunately the act was stopped sort of in the middle by the grandmother who discovered them. Anyway, later on that afternoon, probably an hour or so later, this"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL lady was taken by her 'little people,' the lit- tle gray extraterrestrials, and taken aboard a spacecraft. And they did a sort of whole medical healing procedure on her, the little gray guys did.\" Cure of flesh wounds is only one cate- gory. There are cures involving virtually every part of the body. For example, in the following case, investigated by Bob Teets, author of West Virginia UFOs, a man was reportedly cured of dental problems. CASE #076 involves a man by the name of Daniel D. from Harrison County, West Virginia. Daniel reports that he has had many, many contacts with \"gray guys\" and \"tall green, lotus-looking figures.\" Daniel feels that his aliens are quite friendly. As he says, \"They've never hurt me, that means a lot... I think they've helped me in certain ways. I've heard for years that I [had] to have my wisdom teeth out. One day they were bothering me really bad, and I was in no financial situation to get them fixed, no insurance. That night I was abducted. I can remember it felt like they were stuffing things on my teeth where my wisdom teeth are. The next day they didn't bother me anymore and haven't bothered me since. That was a couple of months ago.\" E xtraterrestrials are apparently able to cure a huge variety of illnesses. One ill- ness whose cure has eluded our own grasp is the common cold. However, as we shall see, ETs have reportedly cured colds with a simple beam of light. The following case was investigated by one of the leading pio- neers of ufology, Leonard Stringfield. It is one of two cases I found in which people were cured of the common cold. CASE #036: On May 10, 1975, Chuck Doyle of Florence, Kentucky went outside to check his horse when he encountered a twenty-foot long metallic object shaped like a \"manta ray\" hovering over his neighbor's garden. The object had colored lights and was emitting a green beam of light. Suddenly, the light began moving towards Chuck. He described it as \"a straight shaft of light that didn't get wider at the bottom, like a laser ... then the beam came at me. When it hit me, it was like being hit by a bucket of ice-water. I felt suddenly frozen. I couldn't move.\" Chuck was actually frozen in the position of trying to run away. Although he was leaning forward, he was held in position by the beam. To his surprise, a flood of strange symbols and images filled his mind. He saw mathematical equations, images of a strange planet and a kaleidoscope of strange colors. Then the beam retracted and Chuck fell to the ground. The UFO disappeared with a purple flash and a loud bang. Chuck returned to his house in a state of shock. It wasn't until he returned inside that he noticed something strange. Before the en- counter, he had been suffering from a miser- able head cold. Immediately afterwards, all traces of the cold had disappeared. Chuck saw a doctor a week later, making no men- tion of his UFO encounter. The doctor pro- nounced him perfectly healthy. ETs have shown a great interest in human eyes. There are several cases on records in which people have had their eyeballs re- moved from the socket and then replaced. The following case, from UFO investigator John Carpenter, is a typical example, except for the fact that there was a marked im- provement in the man's vision. CASE #089: This case involves a 21-year- old man from the mid-western United States by the name of Eddie X. Eddie was in the middle of a series of hypnotic regressions to explore his many abductions when he expe- rienced yet another encounter. Carpenter notes: \"During a physical examination by the beings, Eddie's right eye was removed. He felt it pulled out and replaced. Afterwards there was a redness, a physical soreness. He did not feel they were implant- ing anything behind his eye, only that they were 'fixing' him. The side benefit of this operation appears to be enhanced colors.\" Carpenter further substantiated the heal- ing by obtaining a statement from Eddie's eye-doctor which says that Eddie suffered from \"profound color blindness,\" though af- ter his experience, his vision \"had improved up to green color blindness.\" T he above is only one of several cases in which people noticed dramatic improve- ments in their eyesight as a direct result of a UFO encounter. Why these healings are tak- ing place remains a matter of speculation. The question has divided researchers into those who feel that the aliens are healing \"A straight shaft of light that didn't get wider at the bottom, like a laser... came at me. When it hit... it was like... a bucket of ice-water. I felt suddenly frozen. I couldn't move.\" • Case 76 West Virginia UFOs by Bob Teets, Headline Books, Terra Alta, WV, 1995, pp. 26-27. • Case 36 Situation Red by Leonard Stringfield, Fawcett Crest, NY, 1977, pp. 63- 69. • Case 89 Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind by C.

The question has divided researchers into those who feel that the aliens are healing peo- ple out of kindness, and those who believe that the aliens heal people for their own selfish pur- poses. The experiencers are also equally di- vided. • Case 19 The Other by Brad Steiger, Inner Light Publications, New Brunswick, NJ, 1992, pp. 145-146. • Case 80 Encounters by Edith Fiore, Doubleday, NY, 1989, pp. 132- 145.

The following case, investigated by long- time UFO researcher and author Brad Steiger, may be unique in the history of ufology as it not only involves a well-veri- fied healing, but the healing occurred to a well-known UFO investigator. Even more astonishing, the UFO investigator had been told by an experiencer that he was going to have a contact. And when the contact actu- ally occurred, it was witnessed by four other UFO investigators. CASE #019: On December 7, 1967, Danish UFO investigator Hans Lauritzen and four of his friends were conducting an active field investigation of UFOs. Their re- search had led them to participate in routine sky. watches in hope of observing a UFO close-up. Lauritzen had reason to believe that he might encounter a UFO in the near future. One month earlier, Lauritzen had been contacted by a Swedish girl who told him that he was on the list of the Space People as one of the Earthlings scheduled for con- tact. However, sitting out in the field wait- ing for a UFO was particularly difficult for Lauritzen as he was suffering from an ill- ness that made such work very tiring. In February of 1966, he had contacted severe liver hepatitis and had to retire and go on a pension. At the time of the UFO watch, Lauritzen was not only tired and weak, his liver was ten centimeters increased in size. Just before ending the sky watch on December 7, the five men were surprised to see two \"great, dim, yellow globes about a hundred yards away from them.\" Lauritzen immediately became hypnotically en- tranced, walked away from the group and had a telepathic communication with the UFO occupants. The conversation was about helping humanity. Lauritzen was told he had great power to help people. After an hour, Lauritzen suddenly came out of his trance and heard his friends call- ing. He ran towards their voices and was surprised to find that he didn't even feel tired. As he says, \"I ran and ran so fast that my four friends could not follow me. I had to wait for them. I realized that I had been cured of my hepatitis.\" Lauritzen went straight to the doctor. Says Lauritzen, \"I passed a medical exami- nation, not mentioning my contact, of course, and to the surprise of the doctors, ten centimeters of my liver had disappeared so that it was now normal size. The blood test showed that it functioned now as any other healthy liver... before I had a sick liver. At one time it was as much as sixteen centimeters too large. Now I have a healthy liver. I am most thankful to the UFO for curing my otherwise chronic disease... I swear to God that I have told the truth as far as I can see it.\" The following case, investigated by Edith Fiore, Ph.D., involves a young boy who was cured of an extremely rare disease that would otherwise have been fatal. This case also illustrates how shockingly advanced aliens are reported to be in the field of med- icine. CASE #080: At the tender age of eighteen months, \"Ted\" of Santa Clara, California was diagnosed with a rare congenital disor- der known as angioma, which is a vascular malformation in the brain. Typically, this condition puts tremendous pressure on the brain, usually causing epilepsy. In Ted's case, the bloods vessels in his brain were abnormally large, causing a variety of dev- astating symptoms. His case was so severe that doctors gave him only a few years to live. Meanwhile, Ted's condition rapidly dete- riorated. By the time he was three, he suf- fered from double vision and partial paraly- sis; he was unable to talk or feed himself, and the right side of his body had stopped growing. About this time, when Ted should have died, his condition began to miracu- lously improve. He was hospitalized for ex- ploratory surgery. The surgeons, to their amazement, discovered that the abnormal tissue growth had not only stopped, but the tissues had shrunk. They were unable to provide an explanation. Years later, however, Ted discovered the explanation. Under hypnosis, he recalled being taken aboard a UFO where he was laid on a table and strange lights were shined on his head. \"When they turn the ap- paratus on,\" Ted said, \"a beam of light comes out. It's very straight, and it's very thin. It's needle-like. It's very much like a laser light. And it comes out and strikes my head, but it doesn't hurt. Ted recalled that the aliens actually cut open his skull and examined his brain."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"...They touch all over and they find en- largement. And with the laser light, they're able to shrink it.\" Ted noted that the light had the \"thick- ness of a spiderweb\" and seemed to be \"al- most like silk.\" After the beams were shone on his brain, another suction-like instrument was placed over his brain and an ash-like substance caused from the laser was re- moved. The top of his skull was placed back over his head and healed with another in- strument that emitted a strange beam of light. \"This time instead of cutting it, it mends,\" said Ted. \"It mends the skull back together. The atoms go back together and there's no scar tissue. And when it's fin- ished, there's no indication that the skull has been opened.\" Serious diseases seem to pose no prob- lems for extraterrestrials, either. Consider the following case, investigated by David Jacobs, Ph.D., in which a young girl was evidently cured of diphtheria. CASE #O16: In 1972, Alice Haggerty, then six years old, was stricken with diph- theria. Because of her religious background, she had not been vaccinated against the dis- ease. For the same religious reasons her par- ents refused to take her to the hospital. The doctor pleaded, but her parents were firm. Alice got sicker and sicker until the doctor told her parents that he did not expect Alice to live through the night. That night, Alice was transported inside a UFO where she saw aliens whom she de- scribes as \"angels in white robes with silver belts.\" Alice now realizes that her experi- ence matches the typical onboard UFO ex- perience. Inside the UFO, the aliens waved a small \"rod-like device\" around her body and then made her stand inside a \"large blue cylinder.\" A blue light was turned on, and then Alice exited the cylinder. According to Jacobs, the aliens \"informed her in a matter- of-fact way that she was now cured and 'cleansed.' \" D iphtheria, tuberculosis, polio, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy are just a few of the many diseases reported cured by aliens. Nearly every organ and organ system has been cured at one time or another. The study and treatment of heart disease has made great advances in the last few decades, mainly because of a huge increase in the number of deaths caused by heart dis- ease. There are several cases on record in which ETs have reportedly cured people of heart problems. Consider the following case which comes from UFO abductee Katharina Wilson. CASE #060: On August 7, 1989, real- estate broker Katharina Wilson of Portland, Oregon was injured by a nearby lighting strike while staying in Pensacola, Florida. She knew she had been injured by the strike, but decided to wait until morn- ing in hope that her condition would im- prove. That night, Katharina was taken aboard a UFO. She woke up to find herself lying on a table, suffering from excruciating chest pains. As Katharina watched from a dissoci- ated state, gray-type aliens cut a square into her chest and attached a black mechanism with several extensions to the hole in her chest. When the pain became particularly in- tense, the aliens telepathically told her, \"We are repairing your heart. You will be okay now.\" The next morning, Katharina woke up with a sore chest, but was otherwise healthy. As she says, \"The first thing I did when I got out of bed was to look for a scar of a square cut into my chest. I found nothing. No blood on my sheets and no scar. My chest was sore throughout the day, but it was not as sore as I would have expected it to feel after such a radical operation. I be- lieve this machine they had over my head was realigning the electrochemical impulses in my heart because they had been altered by the lightning ... somehow I believed the aliens were repairing the damage the high voltage of the lightning had done to my heart.\" Katharina reports that she has undergone a large number of operations at the hands of aliens: \"They have performed surgery on me many, many times!... It was shocking to remember the different times the aliens had performed surgery on me... What could the aliens be doing to me that would require my having surgery so often? It was not the first time I felt I may be a part of a huge experi- ment.\" Tumors and cysts are by no means rare. Millions of people have had to deal with the shock of discovering a cyst, and then for some comes the agony of biopsy and possi- ble surgery. (In fact, President Clinton just The top of his skull was placed back over his head and healed with another instrument that emitted a strange beam of light. \"This time in- stead of cut- ting it, \" said Ted, \"it mends the skull back to- gether. The atoms go back together ... and when it's finished, there's no in- dication that the skull has been opened.\" • Case 16 Secret Life by David Jacobs, Simon & Schuster, NY, 1992, pp. 191- 192. • Case 60 The Alien Jigsaw by Katharina Wilson, Puzzle Publishing, Portland, OR, 1993, pp. 127- 129, 250.

One case comes from none other than Debbie Jordan, who was featured in Budd Hopkins' book, Intruders. Debbie had been diagnosed with a cyst which disappeared in conjunction with a UFO encounter. I have also uncovered a very similar case and there are several others in the literature. One im- pressive case was revealed by longtime MUFON field investigator, William Hamilton, Jr. CASE #078: This case involves a lady with the pseudonym Morgana Van KJausen, from southern California. She had several close encounters throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. On December 4, 1994, Morgana went to the doctor and discovered that she had an unwelcome cyst. As the chief investigator of the case. Bill Hamilton noted: \"An x-ray found a peculiarity in the axillary segment of the right breast. This was followed by an ultrasonography over the same area. A small non-cystic mass measuring 1.6 x .6 cm was found in the problem area.\" Surgery was scheduled for December 14, so that Morgana could have time to recover from the slight fever she had developed. However, a day before the surgery, on December 13, Morgana was driving with her son when they both saw a \"white trian- gular-shaped craft.\" That evening, Morgana was overcome by intense pain in the area of the non-cystic mass. She tried to get up but was unable to move and lost consciousness. When she woke up the next morning, she went straight to the doctor for surgery. That's when both she and her doctor got a huge surprise. The doctor inserted a needle into the mass and took another X-ray. To everyone's surprise, the new X-ray showed that there was no mass. The old X-ray was retrieved which clearly showed the mass. Another ul- trasound was ordered which confirmed that the mass had disappeared. As Hamilton ob- served, \"Both the radiologist and the sur- geon confirmed that the previous diagnostic had revealed a solid mass and that solid masses don't just disappear.\" Hamilton speculated that the aliens might have removed an implant, but that \"the ex- planation is only speculative.\" C ancer has long been one of the most dreaded of all diseases. Not only can it strike any part of the body, but its causes are only partially understood, treatments can be very painful, and cures are not always effec- tive. As it turns out, however, cancer is the single disease which aliens have reportedly cured the most. This is probably because cancer can strike any organ system. In the following little-known case, a UFO ab- ductee insists, like many others, that she was cured of cancer as a result of her UFO experience. CASE #067: Licia Davidson of Los Angeles, California, has been having UFO contacts for as long as she can remember. In 1989, Davidson was diagnosed with termi- nal cancer. By the time the disease was di- agnosed, it had already metastasized to her colon, making it inoperable. She was given three months to live. She then experienced an abduction, dur- ing which she was placed on a table and given an extensive operation to cure her cancer. In her own words, \"I was abducted. They told me I had cancer. They said, re- lax.' And they did a cure. It was excruciat- ing.\" Licia was returned to her LA home. Upon her next doctor visit, it was discov- ered that all traces of her cancer were gone. Licia has recovered her medical records, and states that her cure has been verified by a major medical university. She also states that she fears the United States government (who has harassed her exten- sively) knows more than she does about the aliens. The above 11 cases represent only a small portion of the total number. However, they are a fairly accurate representation of the various types of UFO healing cases. Although they may sound incredible, there are simply too many cases to be ignored. One or two or even ten cases might be a co- incidence, but when over a hundred such cases exist, little room is left for doubt. People are apparently being healed and of a variety of illnesses. That much, at least, is very clear. A statistical analysis of the total 105 cases reveals many unexpected patterns. The cures can be broken down into four main categories. • Healings aboard UFO (49%.)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL • Healings inside home of witness (22%.) • Healings outside (20%.) • Healings inside hospital room (9%.) The dates of the cures range from the 1930s to the present. Sixty-five per cent of the cures have occurred in the United States, but Europe, England, Russia and South America account for most of the other cases. UFO healings have usually been rele- gated to the realm of the contactee. However, the data shows that 45% of the cases have occurred to abductees as op- posed to 28% which involve cases more properly classified as contactees. A sur- prising 22% of the cases involve people who have had no prior associations with UFOs. Also surprisingly, the statistics show that more men (64%) report cures than do women (34%.) T here are also patterns to the manner in which the cures are affected. Twenty-six per cent involve surgical operations onboard UFOs; 21 % involve some type of light beam; 13% involve alien instruments held over the body, not including the surgical op- erations. Thirteen per cent of the cures oc- curred apparently as the result of being in close association with a UFO; 9% involved pills, salves or medication; 5% involve in- jections, and 5% involve healing by alien mind power. The statistics regarding the types of ill- nesses cured has already been covered. However, it bears repeating that the cures performed are far in advance of our own medical capabilities. Diseases that we be- lieve chronic are easily cured by the ex- traterrestrials. This alone should reveal that when doctors say a condition is incurable, what they are really saying is that they can't cure it. In other words, is there really any such thing as a chronic disease? Or does this label conveniently cover our obvious profound lack of knowledge about the hu- man body? In either case, these healing cases have the potential to teach us a great deal about disease, health and the human or- ganism. If only we could do what the aliens seemingly do... The statistics tell us many things and readers are left to form their own opinions. However, there is one inescapable conclu- sion to be drawn, which is that UFO heal- ings can occur to anyone at any time. The book, UFO HEALINGS: True Accounts of People Healed By Extraterrestrials, has just been released by Wild Flower Press. It is the first book ever to deal with this unusual subject. The book presents over 100 cases of UFO healings. Each case is footnoted and documented. The book is fully illustrated and indexed. It is available from Wild Flower Press for only $13.95.

David Spencer, MUFON's Deputy Di- rector, In- vestigations, is presently compiling MUFON sight- ing reports into a com- puterized database for- mat. This is one of a se- ries of ongo- ing status re- ports. Section 5, Part 2 will appear in a future issue of the Journal. To be considered the same vicinity, locations of reports had to be within one degree latitude and longitude. ^ If there were three or more cases involved, the selection included those in which one day was. skipped in the sequence, in order to account for no one report- ing a sightings for reasons other than objects not being in the area. October 1996 Number 342 Page 10 S eventy-eight groupings of indepen- dent but time-relatable sightings were identified in the database. These groups were composed of 256 reports of events that occurred on the same or sequen- tial days. The events occurred during seven of the nine years from January 12, 1986 through January 28, 1995, and they repre- sent 54 percent of the 471 reports of object sightings in the database during this 3,304- day period. Either \"miniflaps\" are being ob- served or the sightings are of the same or part of a group of aerial object(s) seen at different times and locations. Attempts were made to correlate sight- ings based on the observations of the wit- nesses, but there were only a few successes. More in-depth study would need to be made to establish the basis of each claim, includ- ing factors leading to decisions of shape (e.g., an outline of lights, masked area of the star field, etc.), which is the third most significant feature for corroboration (after location and time). Some correlations are reasonably certain because the descriptions are similar. Some are not highly alike, but the sightings could still be of the same object seen at different aspects, under different conditions, and by different observers. In some cases, the loca- tions of points of light, seeming to encircle an area, led to imagined shapes. For some correlations, the objects could have been changing shape, as suggested in Section 4, Part 2. Portions of data may be valid and others simply coincidences. Since there is no certainty that events within these groups were related, this analysis is an exercise of possibilities. In the viewpoint of this author, there is potential for a significant amount of re- search with this material, especially if it is used together with other data outside this database. MULTIPLE SIGHTINGS, SAME VICINITY The database contains 84 reports pointing to 31 multiple sightings occurring in the same vicinity 1 and on the same or sequential days? These cases are particularly interest- ing, since they show concentrations of ac- tivity. One could speculate that some sight- ings were the result of the media publicizing other sightings, but this is not evident from the individual reports. Fifty-eight of these same-vicinity sight- ing sets occurred on the same day, 33 during the same hour, and 12 at the same time. As indicated in Table 5-1, which gives addi- tional statistics for these same-vicinity sightings, 22 sets had two sightings each, four had three sightings, two had four sight- ings, and three had more. There was a total of 12 States involved, and 20 different vicinities were identified. The name given to a vicinity identifies a town or city close to the sighting locations, since 21 of the sets included sightings in multiple locations. The reports involved 33 CE, 28 MA, 11 FB, and four AN cases. Sixty-one CE and MA sightings were distributed over twenty- six (84 percent) of the same-vicinity sets. Because CE and MA sightings are usually associated with phenomena that defy expla- nation and a high proportion of same-vicin- ity sightings have one or both, the events cannot be simply dismissed. All of the six major object shapes were observed, the most prominent being the disc (16 events) and the star (13 events). For the objects identified as \"other\" in the table, el- liptical shapes were observed six times and rectangular forms three times. One conical and one cylindrical formation were seen, and six shapes were claimed to be un- known. There were only two sets of multiple events claiming one object shape (January 12, 1986 and March 13, 1988). This may be due to there being multiple different objects, but it is also likely that the witnesses' inter- pretations of the same type of phenomenon differ. Reading the original reports does not conclusively suggest which reason is most likely, simply because there was no unbi- ased observer who could make compar- isons."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL TABLE 5 -1.

October 1996 Number 342 Page 12 As examples, the following two sets of data each involve two sightings: 1. October 26, 1988 - Apparently, the same object is seen first headed in one direc- tion then headed in the opposite direc- tion: At 2100 hours during a local power outage in Fresno, California, a man and his wife were strolling along the northern end of Woodward Lake out- side the city when the husband noted a strange set of lights about a mile to the northeast of them. There were about nine white lights in a string that ap- peared to be longer than a 747 jet air- craft and looked \"like a short passen- ger train with lights along the side. \" The two watched the lights moving slowly to the southeast, until they faded out of sight in the distance about five minutes later. (Log # 890101 - FB-1) At 2230 hours on the same day, a man went outside his house in Fresno, California to find the extent of the lo- cal power outage. He noticed an odd string of lights within a mile of them in the Southeast, at an altitude of roughly 4,000 feet. He summoned his wife, and the two of them went into their back yard to see the object more clearly. They could see two rows of between six and eight bright white lights, the rows separated about 25 yards and the string spanned about 50 yards. The object was moving to the northeast in a straight line, initially go- ing about 50 miles-per-hour. Over three minutes later, it sped up and went out of view in the foothills in a matter of seconds. (Log # 890102 - FB-1) 2. May 20, 1989 - Possibly the same object was seen at nearly the same time from two different States: At 2230 hours, several men at a camp outside Long Eddy, New York spotted a triangular object to the West travel- ing southward, along the Delaware River but beyond the mountain ridge more than a mile away. Like a triangu- lar kite inverted, the object's apex was pointed downward. Multiple (15-20) soft but bright red, orange, and bluish lights outlined each leg, and the object was trailed at 200-400 yards by two larger red lights. The men believed the pattern was moving at between 150 and 300 miles- per-hour. They were sure they could detect a hum from the object, since the evening was otherwise quiet on the campgrounds. After about four min- utes, the object moved behind the mountain ridge and was hidden from their sight. (Log # 890627 - MA-1) At 2240 hours, near Honesdale, Pennsylvania, a man arose from bed and looked out his window to see a very large (estimated 200- by 300- feet), rectangular object hovering at a distance but below an altitude of 500 feet. Since the object did not appear to have a solid structure, the shape and size were based on amber lights at each of its corners. There were three amber lights in a row at the front, which, after about three minutes, changed from steady to flashing as the object began slowly moving to the Northeast, toward the Delaware River. The man claimed to hear the \"whirring sound of several electric motors. \" (Log #890628-MA-1) The circles in Figure 5-1 illustrate the same-vicinity sighting locations. In four re- gions, the locations appear to be overlap- ping, but this is because the circles denoting them are much larger than the actual vicini- ties. For example, the two vicinities near the western tip of Florida are associated with Gulf Breeze, Florida (also including Cantonment, Milton, Navarre Beach, Pace, Pensacola, and Warrington) and Atmore, Alabama (including Loxley). The concentration of vicinities in the Northeast is characteristic of the database quantities of reports seen there as compared to elsewhere in the U. S. Sixteen vicinities are located east of the Mississippi Riven.Six States have more than one identified vicin- ity, and four of these States are north and east of Illinois. Although they are interesting, the same- vicinity sightings, alone, do not unfold much information that could be useful for analysis of the UFO phenomena. On the other hand, it might be useful for providing"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL TABLE 5-2.

MULTIPLE INTERSTATE SIGHTINGS The database provided 65 groups of events from 227 reports in which sightings in dif- ferent States/Providences were seen on the same or sequential days. The data averaged 2.7 States/Providences and 3.5 sightings per set. A condensed summary of this data is provided in tables 5-2 and 5-3. There were 81 CE, 82 MA, 47 FB, and 17 AN cases in the reports. As with the same-vicinity sets, nearly all of the group- ings included either CE or MA events, and the majority included both. One or more CE, or one or more MA cases occurred in 62 (95 percent) of the sets, and 36 (55 per- cent) had both. This means that the data cannot be easily discounted. All groupings included one or more of the six principal shapes (boomerang, disc, oval, sphere, star, and triangle), averaging two of these shapes per set. Multiple sight- ings were made of the same shape in 25 grouped sets. Disc and oval shapes were each reported in 36 events, the star in 40, sphere in 22, boomerang in 14, and triangle in 15. Among the objects reported in the tables as \"Other\" are 12 rectangles, eight each of cylinders and ellipses, and 23 very individualized descriptions. Other evidence of events crossing State boundaries was not included in the grouped sets, because no object shape was actually observed. Two cases involved visitations or abductions alien beings on the same day, September 20, 1994. The first was at 0100 hours in Yuma, Arizona, and the second at midnight in Miami, Florida. UFO SIGHTING \"TRACKS\" Provided the interstate sightings within each grouping are related, linking the cases to- gether across large distances could illustrate pathways, or tracks, which may provide added insight into the behavioral patterns and focuses of UFOs, primarily in the United States. At the least, knowing re- peated sources, homing areas, and tracks for UFO activity could help identify where ob- servations are most likely. Relating the sightings within sets The following four statistics, taken together, provide substantial evidence that the grouped sets are more than random coinci- dences. In turn, this suggests that the sight- ings may be related: 1. For this data, there were 192 days in which sightings were made outside the dates of the grouped sets, and there were 182 days of sightings within the grouped sets. There is only 5 percent difference between the two sets. 2. Whereas the reports that were not grouped averaged 1.1 sightings per day, the grouped ones averaged 1.5 per day. 3 There were over 36 percent more sightings seen on a single day within the grouped sets than outside the sets. 3. The average time between sightings for the 374 sighting dates was 8.8 days for the database during the 3,304-day pe- riod covering this data. If the 182 dates associated with the grouped sets are removed, the average for the data- base is 17.2 days between event dates, nearly double the original. 4. All but five sightings are sufficiently separated in time (measured using Greenwich Mean Time) for objects to traverse the distance between the sighting locations at less than 2,000 miles-per-hour. It would be naive to believe every sighting was related to another, but potential scenarios of multiple-object movements support the validity of all but one of these cases. Because any number of scenar- ios are possible, these five cases are retained as part of the total evidence for UFO sighting tracks. The likelihood that a person who ob- served an object would not contact a MU- FON Field Investigator to investigate and report it is probably high. When this is fac- tored into the statistics, it is easy to conjec- ture that the occurrence of multiple sight- ings is more indicative of what is actually happening than are the single, time-isolated observations. Most UFO sightings may be only samples, or time stamps, of the move- ments of objects over long-distances. There are assortments of objects seen within most of the sets, which leads to the assumption that the sightings were not in- fluenced by news of other sightings. The variety of shapes also makes corroboration Disc and oval shapes were each report- ed in 36 events, the star in 40, sphere in 22, boomerang in 14, and trian- gle in 15. Among the objects reported in the tables as \"Other\" are 12 rectangles and 23 very individualized descriptions. • Section 4, Parti, Viewed Objects: Sighting Conditions, Shapes and Multiple Objects, July 1996, pp. 3- 8. • Section 4, Part 2, Viewed Objects: Distance and Size, Surface and Colors, Emissions, Landings and Following the Witness, May 1996, pp. 3-8. •* The average of 1.1 sightings per date for the non- grouped events is due to witnesses having more than one sighting on one day. October 1996 Number 342 Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL An inspection of Figure 5-2 results in a few points that may be highly signifi- cant for fu- ture UFO studies. The first, and most obvious, deduction is that the area of Gulf Breeze, Florida was a major focal point, involv- ing many en- tries and ex- its of objects. Definitions: • AN Anomaly • FB Fly-by • MA Manuever • CE Close Encounter October 1996 Number 342 Page 16 especially difficult. Rather than speculate on possibilities, all cases are retained as evi- dence of relatable sightings. A few sets of data, in which similar- shaped objects are described, give a degree of assurance that the sightings (within these sets) are mutually corroborating. These identified sets are flagged by a dark circle in the Year column of tables 5-2 and 5-3. An example of one set of these mutually- corroborating events is the grouping for the July 16 - July 18, 1989 period. Beginning at 2015 hours on July 16, in New Harmony, Indiana, a CE event identified a glowing white disc with multiple unwavering white and red lights on the bottom. Two hours and 1,750 miles later, at 2030 hours in Corcoran, California, a glowing oval was seen at a distance, the oval appearing yel- low-orange with a trail of orange sparks. At 2030 hours the next day and 1920 miles from the second sighting, a dark oval hav- ing a gray surface and bands of unwavering red lights was sighted at a distance in Gulf Breeze, Florida. The fourth sighting was made 90 miles away and one day later, at 2055 hours, near Button, Alabama. A glow- ing white oval was moving slowly eastward. The fifth was a distant sighting a few min- utes later the same day, but 280 miles away, in Memphis, Tennessee. The object was identified as a white star with a red hue. To correlate these sightings, a disk had to become first an oval, then a star. This dis- crepancy could simply be a matter of the angle of perception and the distance. The color differences between the first two ob- servations could be attributed to unseen smog, smoke, or humid air and dust in California, which absorbed the shorter wavelengths of the white light and changed its appearance to a yellowish color. Yellow and red lights, merged because of distance, would make the object appear orange. Collected view and observations of the evidence In Figure 5-2, the sightings are geographi- cally mapped for each set of data, to build a prototype model picturing UFO sighting tracks. The lines were drawn in the order shown by the forward arrows between the State abbreviations in tables 5-2 and 5-3. An inspection of Figure 5-2 results in a few points that may be highly significant for future UFO studies. The first, and most ob- vious, deduction is that the area of Gulf Breeze, Florida was a major focal point, in- volving many entries and exits of objects. This probably comes as no surprise to any- one. Of course, any location with such an abundance of sightings would automatically become a major focal point, as it probably should. Some, possibly a lot, of the Gulf Breeze UFO activity may have been (or still be) associated with interstate travels. Another focal point was in the region of Concord, Derry, and Manchester, New Hampshire. The possible existence of this focal point is supported also by the three same-vicinity locations in New Hampshire (Figure 5-1). From August of 1989 through July of 1990 there may have been a tempo- rary shifting of activity from Florida to New Hampshire. In 1989, there were only three different sets of interstate sightings that in- cluded New Hampshire, two of which also included Florida. Through July of 1990, there were nine groupings that included New Hampshire, and five of these were part of the 13 sets that included Florida. In two sets, totaling five sightings, Florida and New Hampshire were the only States in- volved. As the many lines along the eastern edge of the United States suggest, there may have been many more voyages between Florida and New Hampshire than are sug- gested by the New Hampshire sighting re- ports. Another focus, or a frequented intersec- tion, is in western central Michigan. The interactions with Gulf Breeze, the potential UFO intersections and changes of direc- tions, the four same-vicinity locations in Indiana and Michigan (from Figure 5-1), 18 sighting locations across lower Michigan, and nine sighting locations across the upper edge of Indiana all sup- port this proposition. A major crossing point appears at the southern end of Indiana, between Indianapolis and Louisville, Kentucky. Although no same-vicinity location exists in the region, there are 28 sightings in the database that support the possibility that this has been a major intersection. Similarly, an intersection is apparent in Oklahoma, due to southwestward tracks from the northeastern corner and north- westward tracks from the southeastern cor- ner, and it is supported by 16 Oklahoma sightings near the track lines. Another intersection is observed in Illinois. Tracks from Maine and New Hampshire, and from Connecticut appear to join.

There are only six sighting locations in the database supporting this intersection, but this may be because there are fewer tracks than at the •^ other intersections. Rather than calling them tracks, each set of combined multiple tracks will be called a traffic way, since there are so many in con- centrations. Referring to Figure 5-2, one traf- fic way would be between Florida and Maine, and another between Florida and Michigan. These form a triangle with one be- tween Massachusetts — New Hampshire — Vermont and Indiana — Michigan. Another traffic way may have existed between the far Northeast and southern California, and an- other from Gulf Breeze to the far Northwest. There is no certainty that what has been observed in past data will continue with the same patterns in the future, but if a few of the focal points represent UFO operation bases, then there is a possibility that many routes, if validly identified, will be re- tained. If so, perhaps the foresight can lead to more investigative efforts in the principal areas. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS There is significant evidence that a large number - possibly a large percentage - of sightings have been associated with UFO travels across State boundaries, that some have been extensive in distance, that there have been focal locations or stopping points, and that several main traffic ways were formed. October 1996 Number 342 Page 18 MORE ABOUT \"ALIEN AUTOPSY\" - Continued from Page 19 Recently a TV researcher discovered that I had produced a 1971 horror film in Hollywood, \"BRAIN OF BLOOD\" (a/k/a \"The Creature's Revenge\") which featured a brain operation/transplant scene which looked very much like the Alien Autopsy. We compared the footage from my film and the autopsy and indeed there were some ar- eas which looked similar. If someone had faked the alien autopsy footage it would seem that they studied many similar movie scenes in their research, including \"BRAIN OF BLOOD\". Since I have been working on \"BE- YOND THIS EARTH\" as my main UFO focus, I didn't think it was my job to debunk the \"alien autopsy\" even though many peo- ple, for reasons unknown to me, still ask my opinion. This led to my reviewing the com- mercial video tape of that program. I did discover one interesting item: The newly filmed part of the show, pre- sents someone opening old film cans of 16MM motion picture film, apparently this being the autopsy footage. What struck me instantly is that they were opening 400 foot (ten minute) old cans and not the original three minute cannisters that Ray Santilli told me about. Also striking was the fact that these film cans and reels were of Kodak manufacture circa 1932, not 1947. I decided to run this section single frame to see if I could make out any labels of a military or government nature or with a date. I could only read the labels on two cans, which noted \"A BRINY BOOB\", reel 1 and reel 2.1 decided to look this title up in the copyright catalogue of the Library of Congress, and found the following entry: (see excerpt of original page) A Briny Boob (Billy Dooley comedies) - 1926. 2 reels - (with the credits.) It is possible that Ray Santilli had no actual film elements only the subject reproduced on videotape. The film cans shown were old home movie releases on 16MM film of old Hollywood comedies and such which were made for rental film libraries in the 1930's. If the \"alien autopsy\" is a fake, who made it and why? One source told me he met a special effects man who claimed to have made the alien dummy for the films which were recently faked in Canada. I have no proof of this. Looking at the video of these films there are many technical details which to a film person look wrong. I cannot state by who or why these films were made. I can only hope that when the government intends to inform the world of aliens and UFOs, that they will de-classify their footage and give fair and equal access to all to see and show this material.

Sherman My connection to this film is a bit more than just viewing it from the sidelines and I will explain further: I am a motion picture producer-writer for over 30 years. In 1961 when I was a maga- zine editor/photographer, I sighted a UFO over the northeastern part of New York City at 2:OOAM in the morning. My sister and parents saw it too and, I shot telephoto stills and motion picture footage of it. I have been curious about the meaning of that sighting to this day. In December of 1992 I started producing a docudrama feature film on the UFO phe- nomenon \"BEYOND THIS EARTH.\" We have filmed all over the world and are still working on the project. Over two years ago an article in the New York Daily News claimed that the U.S. government was giv- ing producer Steven Spielberg access to ac- tual motion picture footage from the Roswell crash. Feeling that I (and the rest of the media) should have equal access to this material, I wrote a letter to President Clinton, which made the rounds in government. An agency wrote back denying this was being given to Amblin Entertainment, naming the produc- tion company and not Spielberg by name, which sounded odd. The next step along this line was infor- mation that a Ray Santilli in England had supposedly gotten \"this\" footage. Since I wished to license a few of these clips for \"BEYOND THIS EARTH\", and assuming the footage was authentic, I contacted Mr. Santilli, who was evasive at best. When I contacted him in England he was at a company known as The Merlin Group, which name rang a bell, but later on, as fol- lows: Some years previous a sci/fi thriller I produced and copyrighted known as \"NURSE SHERRI\" had been licensed for Home Video rights in England for a short few year term for England only. At the expi- ration of this term - no rights remained in England, but there may have been video masters still there. Apparently someone got ahold of my video master on \"NURSE SHERRI\" and pirating with an illegal distri- bution license into Canada and perhaps other locations. Due to this piracy in Canada, I lost a big sale of my film to a Canadian company. Upon investigation.the Canadian company claimed they purchased the Canadian rights to my film from the Merlin Group in England. Research re- vealed that both the Canadian video com- pany and the Merlin Group were almost bankrupt, so I could recover nothing from either. Can I be sure that this Merlin Group had anything to do with Ray Santilli - no, I am only stating this as background. My conversations with Ray Santilli re- vealed little about the \"alien\" footage but he told me that the film came in \"three minute cannisters\", most was still undeveloped and had to be sent to a lab in Philadelphia for processing. 100 foot 16MM camera spools of 16MM film running at 24 frames per sec- ond would run at 2.78 minutes each. I initi- ated all of the discussion of film edge code and identification with Mr. Santilli, as he had never heard of it before. I have many years expertise in archival restoration of old 16MM and 35MM motion picture film. I am aware of many tests to de- termine a film's age and authenticity. The Kodak yearly edge code is only one test of many. This became a big issue when Bob Kiviat produced the \"Alien Autopsy\" show for Fox network. I was to be on that show and seen testing a piece of that film for au- thenticity. When I named several other tests besides edge code that I would perform, I was dropped from appearing on the show. On several occasions when people have asked my opinion regarding if the film was a genuine recording of a real \"alien au- topsy\" event, I have stated and will again herein the following, that the film could be one of three things: 1. The absolute genuine article. 2. A fake made for commercial exploita- tion. 3. A changed re-enactment of a real event event, made by an official agency and released through a non-credible source. Possibly to test the public reaction to something like this possibly being real - then if there was no panic the \"agency\" would go further with more release of information, or dis-information.

If his suspicions are true, for- mer astronaut Edgar Mitchell says the lid of secrecy engages nothing less than \"criminal culpability.\" Mitchell, 65, returned to the Space Coast recently to do location shots for an \"NBC Dateline\" retrospective on the Apollo 14 adventure. At the highlight of that mis- sion—Jan. 31-Feb. 9. 1971—Mitchell and Alan Shepard spent 33 hours roving the desolate lunar hills of Fra Mauro. It was there that Mitchell first courted an avant- garde reputation by conducting off-the-clock mental telepathy experiments by transmitting symbolic images to an acquaintance in Chicago. Shortly thereafter, Mitchell left the astronaut corps and founded the Institute for Noetic Sciences in an effort to integrate various scientific disciplines into the study of human consciousness. Mitchell's upcoming book The Way of Explorers will address the latest research upon its release in April. Perhaps because of the imminent publicity, Mitchell found himself invited to a private meeting of former government/military officials hoping to recruit his visi- bility for their most peculiar campaign. \"These were people who in their official capacity had an opportunity in the course of their duties to have ET (extraterres- trial) contact.\" Mitchell says. \"The purpose of the meet- ing was not to convince anybody else of their stories, but to get people released from their security oaths with regard to these phenomena. Given who they were, and their credentials, I have to tell you, it pushed my confi- dence level up five notches.\" Taking a break from the NBC taping, the MIT-edu- cated former Navy captain relaxed at the Villa Roma restaurant in Rockledge and rolled his own imported to- bacco. He expressed his \"total disbelief in a recent U.S. Air Force report attributing the alleged crash of an ET spacecraft in New Mexico in 1947 to a classified military balloon. Last summer, the General Accounting Office an- nounced the failure of its 18-month effort to acquire the dispensation records of the debris from that cele- brated event. In 1994, the Air Force admitted that it initially lied about the wreckage in order to conceal a balloon-based nuclear-monitoring system called Project Mogul. But. unable to produce the paperwork on the re- trieval in question, USAF officials based their case on circumstantial arguments. \"I am convinced there is a small body of valid (UFO) information, and that there is a body of information ten times as big that is total disinformation put out by the source to confuse the whole issue,\" says Mitchell. \"The information is now held primarily by a body of semi- or quasi-private organizations that have kinda spun off from the military intelligence organizations of the past. Just like we build a rocket through a private contractor, there have been private groups involved with this issue for a number of years because they have the expertise. \"The dangerous part is, they're still operating under a black budget, which has been estimated at over $30 billion a year. And nobody knows what goes into black budgets. The prime requisite is security first and every- thing else second. Imagine an organization that has a black budget, an unquestioned source of funds, reports to no one, and has this exotic technology that they can keep to themselves and play with.\" Mitchell, Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper, and some 20,000 Americans have signed the Roswell Declaration, a grass-roots petition calling for an execu- tive order to release UFO documents to the public. Mitchell, however, stresses he has no first-hand knowl- edge of the existence of recovered ET artifacts. And during his Apollo-era training, the subject of UFOs never arose. \"NASA at that time was so sure there were no such things, there was no discussion of it,\" he says. \"I would say, however, that if there was knowledge of ET contact existing within the government, and we were sent into space blind and dumb to such information. I think it is a case of criminal culpability.\" \"To send us up there? Into a what-if scenario? If the evidence is real, and we were led to believe no such thing was possible? To me, that's criminal.\" He says he's looking forward to the discussions his new book will generate. \"We're talking about a revolu- tion.

Saturn (0.8), in Pisces, is in the ESE at dusk and moves west- ward during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-4.0) rises in the E about 3:45 AM in mid-November. The lunar crescent lies only 1.4° below the planet on the 8th. Mars (1.1), in Leo, rises in the E about midnight. The red planet stands in the SSE at dawn. Look for it 5° above the Moon on November 5. This month the U.S launches its first Mars spacecraft since Mars Observer was lost in space three years ago. Called Mars Global Surveyor, this craft will orbit the ruddy world next September and photomap the planet's surface for one Martian year. Saturn sets in the W about 2 AM. Life on Mars? A NASA and university team announced in August (when this is being written) that they believed they had found \"evidence for primitive life on early Mars.\" After examining a Martian meteorite discovered in Antarctica in 1984, the 9 researchers described finding 3 items of evidence for past life in the 4-lb. rock: 1) organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hy- drocarbons (PAHs), the decay products of dead microorgan- isms; 2) carbonate globules with outer rings of iron sulfide and magnetite, characteristics of biological processes (especially anaerobic bacteria); and 3) clusters of tiny ovoids and tubular structures resembling microfossils of ancient Earthly bacteria (but 100 times smaller). While each one of the elements of evidence can have alter- native inorganic explanations, the researchers were impressed by the fact that all three components were found extremely close to each other spatially. If the carbonates actually did form 3.6 billion years ago (this dating is being disputed). Mars at that time was believed to be warmer and wetter. Perhaps microbial life developed and later fossilized before the water dried up. Everyone agrees that the evidence is \"compelling but not conclusive,\" requiring further independent investigation and confirmation. Meteor Shower: Though an intense display of the Leonid meteors is antici- pated, most likely in 1998 or 1999, eastern North America may be well placed this year for a possibly increased shower in the early morning hours of the 17th. (Normal peak rates are only 10 to 15 per hour.) These swift, bluish meteors streak out of the E from Leo's Sickle after midnight. Many are bright, nearly half of them leaving behind persistent glowing wakes (\"trains\").

CROP CIRCLES REPORT In the summer of 1992, Project Argus investigated one of the most remarkable mysteries of the century, the sudden and baffling appearance of hundreds of huge, magnificent shapes—dubbed \"crop circles\"—in the fields of England each summer. Made of grain flattened methodically to the ground in intricate patterns, they were a form of landscape art which quickly attracted worldwide attention. But the \"artist\" was unknown. Where did they come from?'What agent or force rou- tinely generated them overnight? Could they be products of something other than human activity? It seemed ap- propriate to seek to answer such questions with the in- struments and methods of science. Everyone interested in the study of the crop circle phenomenon should have a copy of the Report on the Results of Project Argus: An Instrumented Study of the Physical Materials of Crop Circles, edited by Michael Chorost, in 1993. Since MUFON provided $2,500 to fi- nancially support this ambitious team project, we have a supply of the 115-page books for sale.

We are extremely indebted to Mr. Stewart for pro- ducing this valuable addition to the literature to per- form UFO research of the MUFON archives. The IN- DEX may be purchased from MUFON in Seguin for $59.95 plus $3.50 for postage and handling. Orders are now being accepted.
