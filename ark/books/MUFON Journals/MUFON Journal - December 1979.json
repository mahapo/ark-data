L FROM THE EDITOR An appropriate New Year's resolution for all of us would be to \"clean up our act\" — to be more thorough, and critical in our investigations of and reporting on \"high strangeness\" UFO cases in particular, and UFO reports in general. To some degree, both Allan Hendry and James Oberg are correct in their criticisms of rank-and- file \"ufology.\" Both, however, paint with a broad brush and seem unable — or unwilling — to recognize competent work by others. Oberg, especially, uses the excesses of irresponsible or incompetent investigators to brand us all. Without considering motives, it must be stated that what they say is grounded in fact. Careless, incompetent, incomplete, uncritical investigation and reporting abound in the field. If we hope to be taken seriously, we must upgrade the quality of our work and set exacting standards of truth and accuracy. In this issue INDIANA SIGHTINGS    3 By Charles L.

Tucker 1 (MUFON State Director) On January 8, 1979, Mr. Marion Ritchie and his wife viewed a UFO on county road 138 right in back of Fairfield High School, Indiana, for a continuous 5 minutes. Mr. Ritchie is a resident of Rome City, Indiana, and an employee of Starcraft Industries in Topeka, Indiana. He knows he viewed something he had never seen in his life — an unidentified flying object. Mr. Ritchie, a credible man in his community, viewed a cylinder-shaped object over an open held about 50 feet from the road with lights of white, red and green. At first he thought it was a water tower, but as he drove under the object he knew it couldn't be. The time was around 8:00 PM. When I interviewed him on February 1,1979, Mr. Rite hie described the cylinder as being 15 feet long and hovering about 75-100 feet from the ground. The lights suddenly became so intense that it was hard for Mr. Ritchie to tell what the object really was. As the lights grew brighter and brighter, the object zipped off into the cold clear night. As Mr. Ritchie and his wife drove off, they were silent at first, then broke into laughter and exclaimed that no one would ever believe what they had just viewed. During the interview Mr. Ritchie stated, \"No way am I trying to hoax this. I know what I seen and I feel it was definitely a UFO.\" On November 8,1978, Mrs. Cathy Wilfong and her sister Mrs. Cindy Bridges viewed a UFO near Greenfield, Indiana. You could say they had very good proof that they did see something unidentified by the large imprint, about 140 feet long, that was left in their soybean field in the back of their home. It was around 9:00 PM when Cindy went out to get some firewood, when she noticed a big fiery light coming •down towards the soybean field. When she went to investigate what the object was, she became frightened and started screaming for Cathy to come out and look at this thing that was coming down towards the field. Cathy knew something was wrong when she heard the screaming and her dog, Babe, barking wildly. When she saw the object coming down she couldn't believe it. Although frightened, Cathy ran to the garage to get her camera. When she couldn't find her camera she ran into the house petrified. At this time Cindy was in the camper watching the object from the inside. She stayed in the camper for an estimated time of 4 minutes. When she noticed Cathy running into the house she decided she had better go into the house too. After calling the Sheriff's Department, Cathy then called her mother who lives 6 miles away from the Wilfong residence; she came immediately and saw the lights of the UFO as it departed. (She watched these lights as she drove towards their house, and first saw them from 4 to 5 miles away as she approached on state road 209.) The Wilfong's live 8 miles from the Sheriffs office, but it took them at least 30 minutes to get to the house from the time Cathy called. Upon the Deputy's arrival they informed Cathy that what they had seen was a \"helicopter.\" This so-called \"helicopter\" made no sound whatsoever, had no propeller so it just naturally threw no propwash, did not have any night flying navigational beacon as required by FAA regulations, and was 120 to 140 feet long! As described by the witnesses, the UFO was oblong, very, very huge with a kind of greenish-dray color. (See sketch.) It had three lights, one red and two white. The UFO did not have any sound, and it moved flying sideways behind the barn and then took off flying frontways. Cathy stated, \"the thing moved like it was in slow motion. It was very huge with three lights. There was some kind of circle in the middle of the bottom or underneath side. The whole time we watched this object, we could only see the bottom side.\" The estimated time they viewed the object was 40 minutes. This UFO incident attracted the attention of the Center for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois. They sent out one of their investigators, Allan Hendry, who is the top field investigator for the Center. Hendry stated, \"This sighting was one of the two most significant sightings the Center has examined in 1978. Due to the fact that this sighting was at such a close range by two credible witnesses and also due to the physical evidence the UFO left, which was the impression in their soybean field.\" Hendry went on to state, \"The impression left in the field is similar to 'Saucer Nests' found and reported in Australia and elsewhere in the World, also indicated the UFO never did touch the ground.\" The stems in the bean field were not uprooted at all, and the stems were intertwined and matted together. The case also was investigated by MUFON Field Investigator, Arthur Morros of Zionsville, Indiana. On September 25, 1978, a very unusual thing happened to Jim Altees. Jim was walking out in an alley near his home in Indianapolis about 10 PM when he heard a loud noise. The noise grew louder and louder, then the ground seemed like it began to shake. He looked up into the sky and saw a bright object coming nearer and nearer to the ground about 100 feet away. (continued on next page) 1. Director of International UFO Investigative Bureau. P.O. Box 228, Nappanec, IN 46550"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Indiana, Continued) Jim's brother Paul was walking with him, and he said he thought that it was just a jet because of the loud noise. But as the two kept watching this object, they knew they were witnessing something very unusual. What was the object that they were viewing? Why did it have so many lights? Jim ran into the house and called the STAR, the local newspaper for the Indianapolis area, to come out and take pictures of this UFO. But the STAR told him to call the police. When Jim called the police they gave him a number to call to report his sighting. He called the number, which was a number in Washington, D.C., and they took the report. The object was described by Jim as being as large as two houses or two 747 jets. George described the object as reminding him of a World War n bomber. He stated, \"I never seen an object in the sky with that many lights!\" There were 18 lights that flashed on, 18 floodlights that beamed very brightly upon them. The shape of the UFO appeared to be octagon. The Altees' only view of the object appeared to be the bottom of the craft. The bottom was described by Jim as being of a shiny silver material with the lights all around the outer part of the craft. Right in the dead center of the craft was a green blinking light. The object remained visible for 4-5 minutes. The Altees were shown a UFO Identification sheet that the Internation- al UFO Investigative Bureau provided them to see if the UFO they had viewed was the same as any pictured on the sheet. They noted that the object was similar to one seen in 1965 only more \"square.\" (See sketch.) When I asked them what they thought of what they had seen, George Altees, the father, stated, \"it could be one of three things. A secret weapon that the United States has got, something from Russia that doesn't show up on our known 'radar,' or it could be from some place else outside the earth.\" Jim stated that \"it was a strange experience...! wanted it to land so I could get a better observation of the craft.\" But they both were convinced that what they had seen was not something they had ever seen before.

Investigations have recently been completed and the following accounts are courtesy of the Tasmanian UFO Investigation Centre, GPO Box 1310 N, Hobart, Tasmania 7001 and UFO Research (Far North Queensland) PO Box 1585, Cairns, Queensland 4870, respectively. Lawitta, Tasmania On February 5, 1979, a Hobart man (name held on file) was returning home from Hamilton in the Derwent Valley when problems occurred with the car he was driving, and it was enveloped in a dazzling white light. The next thing the man was aware of was of being stopped by the police for driving without lights. He couldn't recall who he was, nor anything of the past period of time. In fact he didn't recall anything until a nurse at the Royal Hobart Hospital shone a torch in his eyes, after he was taken there for a medical checkup. The following account then has been reconstructed by TUFOIC's . investigator, Keith Roberts. The reporter estimates he left Hamilton at about 9:30 p.m. on a fine clear evening to drive back to Hobart via the Lyell Highway, a distance of 71 kms. The event occurred at Lawitta some 42 kms from Hobart at around 9:50 p.m. (time is only an estimate), there being little traffic at the time. He recalls that his car radio died out. Pressing the station buttons had no effect and the radio remained dead. Seconds later an intense white light seemed to envelope the car and he could not see beyond the front of the bonnet (hood - Editor.) The car's lights and the motor failed in the same instant. Beyond this things are vague. He thinks he tried to start the car when he realized the engine had stopped. Ten minutes may have been occupied by a stop at this point but we aren't sure of this. If he did stop it must have been in such a manner as not to bring attention to himself from any other cars traveling along the road during this interval. Recollection after this is of driving up the rise in the road from Lawitta, then slowing down for the intersection of the Midland Highway at Granton, 21 kms from Hobart. Shortly after this he was pulled up by the police for driving without lights. He did not know where he was going, where he lived, nor who he was. The police looked at his personal papers and took him home, leaving the car in town. He was then taken to the Royal Hobart Hospital in an apparent dazed condition. Reports quote a pulse rate of 100 and a state of shock. A nurse shone a light into his eye and he backed off as if scared, and then seemed to recover his memory, although even at the time of writing, he still couldn't recall everything which occurred. His vehicle, a Ford Cortina 71 TC station wagon, was recovered later. It was found to have a flat battery and the oil level was low. This is puzzling as according to the reporter it was checked 3-4 days earlier and he hadn't been anywhere since then except for that evening. The battery was fairly new when the car had been bought 12 months prior. The cut-out switch on the alternator needed replacing, as did wiring especially in the headlights. It was bubbled over as if overheated. Radiator water was also low. The reporter does not want to undergo hypnosis to attempt to recover the missing details, which is disappointing for we shall probably never know just what did occur on that night. An inspection of the times of departure, arrival, and expected duration of the trip does not allow us to determine if there is any missing period of time which might have allowed for an \"abduction\" style event to have occurred. The main reason for this is the uncertainty of the reporter's timings, which are only guesswork. Liverpool Creek, Queensland Almost exactly 4 days later to the hour, about 9 p.m. on Friday, February 9, a banana farmer was driving home alone to Mission Beach from Innisfail, North Queensland. Driving down a hill about one kilometer north of the Liverpool Creek bridge on the Bruce Highway he noticed a dull white light which appeared to be sitting on the edge of the bitumen on the left-hand side of the road. Nearing the light he noted what looked like a dark beehive shape behind it. The light then rose vertically, and when it was an estimated 10 meters away from him (one meter off the road) there was a blinding flash. Upon regaining his sight he realized that the car's headlights, dashlights, and engine had ceased to function. The reporter put the car into neutral (automatic transmission) and coasted to a stop in a nearby truck rest area. He was just lighting a cigarette when the headlights and dashlights came on of their own accord. He therefore tried the engine which started successfully the first time and drove home carefully without incident. The object was not seen during this trip home. Once home the car was inspected. The battery leads were tight and in good condition and the terminals free of corrosion. No lasting after-effects were noted on the vehicle since the event. Ms. H. Goriss, investigator for UFOR (FNQ), interviewed the man and reported that he was very unsettled by the event and had absolutely no idea as (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ANOTHER \"BORDERLINE\" UFO By Wayne LaPortc In the past year and a half there have been many reports of \"borderline UFOs,\" that is, UFOs which seem to be true UFOs but may actually be some type of aircraft. Sightings of such a UFO occurred in Scandia, Minn., on March 22, 1978; Orange, Calif., on September 27 and 29, 1978; and in Wheeling, W.Va., on November 3, 1978. On March 9,1979, a \"borderline\" UFO showed up in the Charlotte, N.C., area. It was seen by many, but exactly what everyone saw is difficult to say. For on that particular Friday night a flight of military helicopters flew through the area. Furthermore, the \"choppers\" appear to have been flying with non-standard - navigation lights which created a fantastic UFO illusion. During the first two weeks of March I received several \"good\" UFO reports. Most of the witnesses .requested confidentiality. However, one very credible witness, Steve Morton, elected to \"go public\" to see if any others saw what he and seven others sighted over a field below Monroe, N.C. Local newspaper coverage of the sighting resulted in 11 (Vehicle, Continued) to what he had encountered. After he stopped the car he said that he had a feeling that he'd just had — or just woken up from — a nightmare. The location was inspected with negative results and a magnetic signature check conducted on the vehicle, compared with another wagon of the same make, type, and mileage, showed no large significant differences had occurred. NOTES: For some speculation on this type of event see, \"A matter of fact\" ACOS Bulletin No. 10, June 77, and \"UFO repofts r vehide effects\" ACOS Bulletin No. li, Sept. 77, both by this author. A specialized reported form for vehicle cases is currently being used'by all Australian organizations to gather fine detail on the behavior of the vehicle in such cases.

All encounters occurred on March 9 and a total of 37 people were involved. However, a routine check with the local F.A.A. and Thurston Aviation (which has a military refueling contract) indicated that all .the witnesses may have seen a flight of four Army helicopters that refueled at .Thurston. So, I queried the Army helicopter field at Ft. Bragg, N.C., for flight information on any flights in the Charlotte area on the 9th of March. The answer came in 2 weeks. According to. the Army, a flight of four military helicopters flying in diamond formation did arrive at Thurston Aviation at Douglas Municipal for refueling about 8 p.m. They left at 9:15 p.m. The flight approached from the N.E. on a 250° heading and departed on a 090° due East bearing. They were not on military maneuvers, but on a cross- country training flight flying from Pope AFB to Greensboro, N.C., to Charlotte and back to Pope AFB, N.C. All flights were direct. There were no other Army copter flights in the area that night. By knowing this flight information, I was able to identify 5 out of the 12 cases as being misperceptions of the helicopter flight. However, the other seven cases appear to be a sighting of a \"borderline UFO\" which moved southeasterly out of Charlotte while the helicopters were still on the ground at Douglas. The seven -cases of the \"mystery object\" were abstracted and published in the May 9,1979 issue of the Charlotte News. NEWS, Charlotte, *C May 9, 1979 The first sighting came at about 8:30 p.m. when a Charlotte couple heard a hellcopter-Uke sound and went outside to see two white lights and a red light In a triangular shape traveling toward Monroe. At 8:45 p.m. a Matthews woman said she beard a noise like a tornado and went outside with her daughter. Mrs. Nelda Bahr said she saw three clusters of white lights In a triangular formation with a blinking red light near the rear. •At about the same .time, three teen-- agers, traveling west on U.S. 74 be- iween Monroe and Indian Trail, saw an object traveling southeast near Ken- drlck Brick and Tile Co. with white lights In a triangular shape with a red ' . light at the rear.. Between 9 and 9:19 p.m.. Union County building Inspector Steve Morton was traveling toward his home In the White Oaks subdivision with his family •nd several neighbors la the car. Morton and his family reported see- • Ing • blimp-like object, with three row* of white lights, a red light oa the top and another on the front Up. At about 9 p.m, a woman and sever- al companions spotted an object they thought was the Goodyear blimp Just southwest of Monroe. In Pageland, S.C, at about 9:15, a couple watching television heard a sound like helicopters outside and went to Investigate. When they got outside, the sound stopped and they aaw a rectangular ob- ject with many red and white lights. The object moved slowly away. However, the most intriguing aspect of this case is the possibility that the helicopters- were flying without conventional helicopter lighting. According to eyewitnesses who had a \"close encounter\" with the helicopter flight, no green,, lights were visible despite a head-on approach. In fact, the lead helicopter appears to have been flying with only the red blinking light on while the following three only had their white lights on. The red-lighted helicopter was flying the lead forward point of the diamond formation. All this created the illusion of a huge blimp-like object with white lights on the rear and a red blinking light on the nose. Military and F.A.A. flight regulations both require that a helicopter, have a: blinking red light, visible 360 degrees, and a starboard green light. Of.course, it's possible that the witnesses may have overlooked the green light. However, about 2 years ago, I personally witnessed a flight of helicopters -pass over my .house. I quickly noticed that none of the copters (confirmed on nexf page) r"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"white (3) blinking red white (3) blinking red Army helicopter flight formation flight UFO illusion (Borderline, Continued) was displaying any green or blinking red lights. Their approach .was head-on and they were flying at about 1,000 feet • altitude. After they passed overhead, I noticed a blinking red light on each helicopter. But, I never saw any green lights. And, a total of seven helicopters were in the formation. A friend of mine and Vietnam helicopter gunner veteran related how in 'Nam they would paint out some of the lights in order to confuse the Viet Cong. Such tactics would prevent the 'Cong from successfully identifying the gunships from the troopships. If such tactics are being used stateside during military maneuvers, they may also confuse . many witnesses and UFO investigators alike. Some of the \"borderline UFOs\" may be nothing. more than military helicopters on maneuvers and flying with some of the lights painted out.

Madrid, Spain, November 15 (UPI)--Whatever a government investigation decides, a reported.UFO sighting over Spain must be one of the best-documented on record. The case involves a.Spanish airline pilot carrying 109 passengers who made an emergency landing over the weekend. The pilot claims unidentified flying objects buzzed his plane and threatened a collision. An airport director-among others-says he saw the UFO's, too. And Air Force jets were reportedly sent up to take pictures. Spain's Transport Minister, ordering an investigation, said- \"It is clear that UFOs exist.\" s The 34-year-old pilot of the Spanish Caravelle jet broke his silence on the weekend incident Wednesday and explained why he dropped 14,000 feet and landed in Valencia-on Spain's eastern Mediterranean coast-rather than in the Canary Islands. Francisco Lerdo-who has 15 years experience as a pilot-says he saw two \"intense red lights\" streak across the sky toward his jet shortly before midnight Sunday. Within minutes, he said, the objects closed in. That's when he ordered, his passengers to fasten their safety belts, and he dove toward Valencia. Lerdo claims radar in Madrid picked up the UFOs, and saw them plunge 12,000 feet in 30 seconds in an attempt.to follow him. And the Director of Valencia Airport says he saw the mysterious objects hovering over the airport.

They planned to attend a performance given by a traveling theatre which was •Translated by Lex Mebane from LDLN #175 (May 1978). Edited by Ann Druffel. giving a play, \"Lucrezia Borgia.\" The weather was clear and warm. When they turned into the street, Mme. X and her two companions saw, 60 meters away, a small ovoid object, entirely transparent, which was motionless at a height of 7 or 8 meters at the level of the square and behind the theater. No one in the audience seemed to have noticed it. The play had already begun and everyone's back was turned to the eng/n. It was still daylight. Intrigued, the three witnesses advanced toward the object and distinguished a \"pilot\". He was seated in the front of the vehicle; his height appeared normal. He was dressed in a light-colored suit (combinaison) and seemed to be \"thin and aged.\" Indeed, this individual had a long white beard, and it was this that most impressed the witnesses. The being's skin color was normal. He wore nothing on his head. The witness (Mme. X) no longer remembers certain details of nose, eyes, mouth, hair, etc., but nothing apart from the long beard particularly shocked her.

It was at this moment that, he uncovered in part a second \"personage,\" likewise seated, whom the witnesses could not clearly make out. Mme. X did not see the slightest mechanism in the engfn — or, as is more probable, she no longer remembers very well the details she may have then observed. Presently, Mme. X found herself very close to the UFO.- After reconstruction at the site, we would say 'between 7 and 8 meters; the .object being at an equal height. It measured between 4 and 5 meters in length. At this distance, the witnesses began to call out to the spectators at the theater to have them confirm their incredible vision. The object then immediately .took off, very rapidly and with a slight whistling sound. It disappeared in one second to the NNE, behind the roof of a house. The witnesses could not convince the spectators who had taken notice of them that.•. they . had really, seen something, and they passed \"for madmen.\" This was a lesson to Mme. X, who did not speak of it again, outside her family, for 26 years! • The observation in itself was rather short, about 20-25 seconds. The witnesses felt nothing; they were not frightened. There were no ': consequences for any of the three. They were simply intrigued. While they were descending the street toward the square and the object, Mme. X's husband heard voices \"like Russian.\" As for Mme. X she no longer remembers. Oh the other hand, the object seemed to her, with respect to the ambient light, lighter in the interior. Mme. X was not able to give an answer to the question: \"If you could compare what you saw to a precise memory or to a common and familiar object, what would you compare it to?\" What she saw is perfectly unknown to her and evokes no comparable memory. Some Remarks A. On the witness. We are all personally as convinced as it is possible to be that the witness is of good faith. Mme. X is a good -woman, perfectly well- 10 balanced and poised. Her son has confirmed to us that, when he was quite small, he always heard the same account, without any variation. B. On the observation. This observation attains, undoubtedly, a high level of strangeness. This scene where two beings seemed to watch a theatrical play astonishes us somewhat.. How long had they been there? How does it happen that no one, not even the actors, observed the engin? Was it visible only for the three witnesses and for no one else? There are so many . questions , which must remain unanswered, in view of the long time since the event, and above all the few elements which we have at our disposal. Nevertheless, we can say that the general context of the observation excludes, in our opinion, any error of interpretation on the part of the witnesses. It is to be remarked as rare that such an \"entirely transparent\" object should be observed by day. This type of observation is much more frequent at night and seems linked to the luminosity of the phenomenon. After reconstruction at the site, we arrive at a rather embarrassing interpretation. It seems that the machine must have been inclined toward the witnesses in a way that, whether voluntarily or not, favored their vision. When we were at the site we particularly insisted on this point: Mrs. X definitely saw the beings \"in profile\" and not from underneath, as logic would have required. It is for every reader to draw reflections and hypotheses from this observation in relation to his own experience of the UFO phenomenon. A last word concerning the voices \"like Russian\" heard by Mr. X. Research in the archives has shown us to what a degree the onset of the 1950's was marked by the cold war. The press of the period was impregnated with it, speaking notably of the war in Korea, but also of a mysterious machine in preparation by the Soviets which was to go around the world at a high altitude in a very short time (Sputnik). It is therefore perfectly possible that the witnesses made an immediate and unconscious association between the object observed and the sounds heard on one hand, and the psychological environment of the epoch on the other. In this view, the exact origin of the sounds has little importance, the process described above being much more interesting to analyze and to note. We could just as well reverse the thought and speak of \"mimicry\" on the part of the phenomenon, but in this case we have discovered no element able to come to the support of this hypothesis. C. On the beings observed. We will classify the humanoid observed as Pereira's Type 1, variant 1 (i.e., occupants of normal height who resemble us feature for feature). This type of Ufonaut is the most frequent in the French observations of the 20th century, both in the number of cases (14, thus 11.2% of 126 cases) and in the number of beings observed (70, thus 19.02% of 123 cases). Between the years 1950 and. 1962, these beings have been seen several times on the Mediterr- anean coast. This type humanoid is apparently not aggressive, indeed quite the contrary, their attitude frequently betraying a good knowledge of the terrestrial human environment. On the other hand, it is extremely rare for bearded personages to be. '. observed in this type. This testimony of Mme. X thus constitutes a notable exception, which adds a supplementary note to the \"differences\" usually observed under the resemblances classed by types and variants.

The National Enquirer sent these veteran reporters to the Soviet Union on six separate trips to gather the material for this most absorbing book. Henry Gris, Senior Roving Editor, is an experienced Russia-observer and speaks the language. William Dick, a General Editor, specializes in the latest developments in science, particularly medicine and parapsychology. They used special contacts inside the Soviet Union to reach leading scientists and researchers who had never before talked to Western journalists. The authors obviously know how to get along in the difficult world of Soviet bureaucracy; in fact, the obstacles and their resolving are part of the adventure. Because of their special contacts, the approval of their mission by the Soviet government, the help of the \"Novosti Press Agency,\" the tireless assistance of their two friendly guides, and their own perseverance and capability, the interviews are fascinating. The style is thorough, honest and colorful. Sidelights on the country, citizens, and customs give it extra appeal. There are many good photographs. The book is in three parts, and \"Part Two: The Search for New Life Forms on Earth and Beyond\" is of vital import to ufologists. Here are fresh cases, different researchers with uninhibited theories, and above all, on every side, support from the government. \"The Search for Extraterrestrial Civilizations\" (Chapter 11) covers the effort to capture light or radio signals from space, and to study telepathic messages from UFOs to Russian witnesses. \"The Missing Planet Phaeton\" tells of the theory that a planet similar to Earth but with a more advanced civilization used to orbit the sun just beyond Mars. A tremendous explosion blew it to bits; tektites found in Australia, the Philippines, Czecho- slovakia, and finally in 1975 near the southern border of the Soviet Union are evidence of this explosion. Professor Felix Zigel and author Aleksandr Kazantsev think that refugees from disintegrating Phaeton were forced to flee to Earth 500,000 years ago, thus providing the models for the Honshu figurines found in Stone Age Japanese graves. At this time Zigel refused to talk about'UFOs,.but the tactful persistence of the reporters resulted in the interview, told word for word in the next chapter. \"Professor Zigel and the Soviet UFO Controversy.\" Like us, Zigel deplores the skepticism of the scientists who have not studied the subject, and the sensational aspect. To further research, he recommends building models of UFOs, exploring the more exotic problems of contemporary physics to explain the physical aspects of UFOs, and active experiments with UFOs using laser beams. He considers cooperation between American and Soviet scientists in the study of UFOs to be both possible and desirable. He says that the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in its Program of Possible Communications with Extraterrestrial Civilizations, published in 1975, recommends a system of continuous observation of the entire heavens by radio and radar to discover probes \"sent out by extraterrestrial civilizations which may be at present within our Solar System and possibly even in orbit around Earth.\" Zigel expects that UFO sightings will increase, and considers UFOs the most important area of research existing today. He could not permit Gris and Dick to examine his files, but they resourcefully found their way to \"The Club of Fantasts,\" a meeting of civilian UFO investigators, where the authors heard about individual cases. Although the press .no longer prints UFO news, active investigation continues. Gris and Dick contacted, a senior instructor at the Department of Automatic Devices of the Moscow Technological Institute, an engineer who is trying to devise an automatic probe similar to UFOs. . He has collected many documented case histories, spoken to witnesses, lectured on UFOs and tried to analyze their power source. He thinks we are dealing with a fourth and fifth dimension, and is experimenting in this direction. The cases in his files, which the authors studied, are similar to those in the West. Among the cases described is a fascinating one • investigated by Professor Aleksei Zolotov, head of the Kalinin Geophysical Expedition which is still being investigated. \"The Tungusky 'Divo' (magic miracle) — a Warning Shot from Space.\" This chapter gives us eyewitness accounts of the famous event, and tells of the efforts made to find the cause. Zolotov believes passionately that the nuclear explosion was caused by an unmanned, automatic spaceship, deliberately sent to blow up in an uninhabited region. He fears that another great explosion from out space might be interpreted as having been initiated by somebody on Earth, and thus start a nuclear war. He has sworn to let his beard grow until the mystery of Tungusky is solved, and it is already very long! \"On the Trail of the Almasty —the Caucasus' Abominable Snowman.\" In this chapter Gris and Dick interview a military doctor who examined aBigfoot captured by partisans in the Caucasus during World War II. Besides this unusual story there is a lively interview with Dr. Jeanna Kofman, whose life is devoted to tracking down the Almasty. Her aim is to bring together a Bigfoot and the Soviet parapsychologists, \"to explore the recesses of the human mind as it was when we were coming into being.\" There is no suggestion that the Almasty is connected with. UFOs. \"Part One: Extraordinary Individuals,\" deals with famous psychics, mind reading, clairvoyance, telekinesis, the Kirlian effect and Kirlian himself, healing, and psychic ability of all kinds. \"Part Three: The Scientific Investigations\" covers dream study, aspects of hypnosis and the possibility of using it for mind control, sight-by- touch, use of the Kirlian effect against disease, the latest breakthrough in PSI technology, and acupuncture. The .final chapter, \"Conclusions: the Aftermath of the Toth Case,\" is a thoughtful and perceptive pulling together of the whole subject as related to the policy of Soviet authority.

Nelson (MUFON State Section Director for Orange County) In recent UFO sightings that I have investigated in Orange County, Calif., there have been noted similarities in light effects and UFO shapes with nationally reported UFO events in far- spread geographic locations. For instance, in the MUFON UFO JOURNAL of Jan-Feb 1979, the \"California Report\" column contributed by Morrey Allen 1 described a definite UFO shape accompanied by angled light beams, seen by three young witnesses in Northridge, Calif., on December 14, 1976, at approximately 4:30 p.m. (See Figure A) Comparing these boys' sketch with a sighting I investigated in Orange, Calif., about 45 air miles southeast of Northridge, definite similarities are evident. On February 4, 1978, at 5:30 a.m., the Semaza family, living in Orange, viewed a similarly-shaped object with two light beams angling sideward. In the Semaza sighting, both light beams were red (See Figure B) rather than one red and one green, as in the 1976 Northridge sighting. The Semaza object, fully described in the Jan. 1978 MUFON UFO Journal, 2 also flashed bright white before departing. (See Figure C) In this interesting category of intense white light flashes, let us look at further information regarding the Orange, Calif., sightings of September 27 and 29,1978, which were reported in ; the MUFON UFO Journal of March- April 1979. 3 Both of these sightings began with an intense flash of light in the sky and then, according to the witnesses, \"there was the UFO.\" Since the publication of that article, I have prepared an addendum which notes that two additional persons in the same 12 apartment complex also saw the flashes. 4 Mrs. Maureen La Lave noted it \"looked like a big flashbulb going off behind the neighboring apartment building,\" but she didn't know it was UFO-related until later after she learned what the neighborhood yelling and excitement was all about. Shelly Murphy, a high-school senior, saw a \"blue white flash — not white, not yellowish — which lit up everything\" in their patio area outside. This turned out to have been when the UFO was directly overhead. She went outside later to see what the commotion was all about and watched the UFO depart southward. Now let us compare bright flashes from some other reports: 1. The report of Officer Amparano in Kerman, Calif., on May 13,1978, as printed in the International UFO Reporter, had a detail that was missing from earlier newspaper accounts. IUR reported, \"Suddenly the light source (from the hovering UFO from which he (Amparano) received a 'sunburn') shot out a beam of blue light like a camera flash,\" just before it departed. 5 2. In the same issue of IUR referenced, the following description appears in a discussion of the Belton, Mo., radar-visual case: 6 \"Prior to this, a white flash or light was seen ... witnesses actually heard a loud 'pop' or 'crack' of sound accompanying the flash.\" 3. APRO 7 reported that a Mrs. Kiteveles and a neighbor in Orandaga County, New York, said a bright beam of white light \"lit up everything\" just before the UFO departed. \"Like a flashbulb going off.\" Where have we heard that before? 4. In the Lumberton Report (CUFOS 1976) a cluster of North Carolina UFO events between April 3- 9, 1975 were described by Zeidman, Speigel, and Phillips. One report mentions that Patrolman Hagens and John McPherson saw a triangular- shaped object give a \"blinding flash of light which lit up the woods like a giant flashbulb\" before it rose slowly above the trees. In the final comparison, please refer to the sketch of the West Virginia UFO of October, 1978, in the MUFON UFO Journal 8 in which there is an elongated projection to the UFO shape. This is a decidedly asymmetric and non- standard shape. (See Figure D) Yet a young man in Orange, Calif., on November 2,1978, saw a similar shape only nine days after the West Virginia report. Mike Kinnard's sketches (two days apart) both show a noticeable projection pointing to the left and away from the witness, the arrangement looking strikingly like the West Virginia UFO except for lighting and colors. (See Figure E.) On Thursday, November 2, 1978, Mike and his friend Al Rogers, a fellow sixth grader, were viewing the sky through a hand-held telescope of 15-20 power. They were taking turns steadying the scope on each other's shoulders as they viewed the stars. The night was especially clear with a new moon in the west. The scope was facing east. At 7:00 p.m. a red light moving up from the south attracted them. Traveling east, the light covered 30-45 degrees azimuth over the trees to their right in approximately 2 or 3 seconds. It then stopped in a clear sky (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Figure A Figure B it\" Figure C £ II I • I I I I I Wist Virginil UFO; Octobtr 24. 1970 Figure D Figure E (California Report, Continued) space directly in front of them at about 45 degrees elevation. Mike immediately aimed his telescope and saw that it had two red lights on the aft trailing portion, and the body shape glowed reddish. There were no white or flashing lights, only red. Later the boys drew identical pictures of the object. What impressed Louise Kinnard, Mike's mother, was that both boys drew a hump or lump oh top of the generally ovoid shape, and also indicated a projection in the direction of motion. \"It was like some jet planes have,\" said Mike, wondering if it were some sort of radar dome. During the sighting he noticed \"a beep sound\" which he thought was coming from the craft \"about once every 2 seconds.\" The thing stopped, or was moving very slowly, for about 3 seconds, as though hestitating in its path. As it stopped, the two red lights blinked out, but they came back on as the craft began moving again, accelerating north and moving rapidly out of sight along its original trajectory. The beeping sound stopped after the object went away. Its distance was difficult for Mike to estimate, but it filled about half of the telescope's field of view. I looked at a car about a block away through his telescope, and the car was of similar size. The boys hurried to tell Mrs. Kinnard what they'd seen. Mrs. Maureen LaFave, with whom Mike and his mother were temporarily living, also verified what followed. Both Mike and Al Rogers looked frightened. Mike's face was pale and \"he had goose pimples on his arms.\" When asked why he was scared, Mike responded, \"Because I don't know what it was.\" They next sat down and drew pictures of the object for the adults. Mike was still fearful and went outside again cautiously, but watched the sky for a long time afterward. Mrs. LaFave stated that all during the day and particularly into the evening of the sighting, her pets — a cat and dog — had acted strangely, slinking around with ears laid back, avoiding people, which was very unlike their usual behavior. However, this might- have been due to the fact of new people (Mrs. Kinnard and Mike) in the apartment. Interestingly, both Joyce Dehner (West Virginia) and Mike Kinnard (Orange, Calif.) described the feature on top of the UFO as a \"hump\" rather than as a \"dome,\" which is more usual. With the great variety of shapes and phenomena in ufology, it is somewhat comforting that there are similarities of detail and repeat phenomena among geographically separated events, even if the technological meaning of such similarities eludes our present understanding.

Fawcett MUFON of North Carolina held its third annual training conference in Winston Salem on Saturday, July 14 and Sunday, July 15, 1979. This year's conference, hosted again by officers and members of the Tar Heel UFO Study Group of Winston Salem, was chaired by Mrs. Jayne J. Ware. Representatives, from the four major UFO groups in the United States, APRO in Arizona, CUFOS in Illinois, MUFON in Texas, and NICAP in Washington, D.G., were in attendance. The pioneer leaders of each group were praised at the conference. Almost .50 investigators, researchers, members, and guests of MUFON-NC were present from 17 towns and cities in North Carolina. Henry H. Morton of Wadesboro served as Master-of : Ceremonies for the 2-day conference. Newspaper coverage prior to the conference arid a ; follow-up interview over WFMY-TV in Greensboro at the close of the conference reached an even larger audience. The conference opened\" with a brief cassette tape entitled \"Encounters: Past, Present and Future\" and also a taped message from Walter H. Andrus, the international director of MUFON, who congratulat- ed the Tar Heels for their accomplishments and achievements over the years in the UFO field and who urged continued cooperation of all present with the combined efforts of the four major UFO groups, already mentioned. Henry Morton, an electronic research e.r from Wadesboro, who serves.as a MUFON Field Investigator, was the opening conference speaker. Morton's topic was \"Scientific Phenomena Associated with UFOs.\" Morton : outlined the instrumentational approach to, UFO sightings by \"Project Starlight\" in Austin, Texas. \"Magnetic, electric, gravitational, electrostatic, and radiation effects have been documented worldwide during UFO appearances over the past three decades and such incidents are continuing and need to be investigated by the scientific community,\" Morton said. A study of these effects could lead to an understanding;of the means of propulsion utilized by UFOs, which we may be able to duplicate someday, he added. Nolie L. Bell of Rural Hall, president of the Tar Heel UFO Study Group and an engineer, who serves as a MUFON State Section Director, next outlined the organizational structure and activities of this group. Bell also told the audience about the types of exhibits on display at the conference and handed out a Field Investigator's Kit listing of items needed by UFO investigators. Sgt. E.G. Baker of the Winston Salem Police Department and a certified polygraph operator spoke on \"The Polygraph: Its Uses and Limitations.\" Sgt. Baker outlined the history of the development of the polygraph and the training required for certification. Persons using drugs and/or alcohol can fool the polygraph, as can ones own strong personal beliefs. Despite this, Sgt. Baker said that the percentage of accuracy in using polygraphs today borders around 99.1 percent. The United States and Canada are the only two nations in the world who use polygraphs at the present time, Baker said. \"Polygraph tests by qualified personnel can be used effectively with UFO experiences to serparate truth from deception successfully,\" Sgt. Baker stated. Dr. Jim McGormick of Winston Salem and an employee of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine next gave an illustrated slide presentation on \"Dolphins, Most Unusual Creatures\" and spoke of the difficulty encountered in trying to crack the code of the dolphin's language. Dr. McCormick mentioned NASA studies, which showed that the dolphins had brains like humans and communicated easily among themselves. Government studies were undertaken by the pioneer John C. Lilly in 1964 in hopes that once we were able to communicate with dolphins, we would open the door to communication with extraterrestrial intelligences in the Universe someday. \"The dolphins have the smarts, but not the machinery to speak English,\" Dr. McCormick stated. He also told of some of his experiences with dolphins at the Quinlan Marine Attractions in Lincolnton. Opening the evening program, I presented a talk entitled \"Where Do We Go From Here?\" I noted that we have learned two things: the people who have seen UFOs have not lied about their UFO experiences, but the various governments who have investigated their experiences have lied and are continuing to lie about their investigations. According to new revelations, some uncovered by the recent Freedom of Information Act lawsuits against the CIA and others yet to come against the USAF, our government agencies have made the UFO enigma the biggest public deception in American History regardless of motives. Sam Jacobson of Winston Salem was the next speaker and his topic was \"Sound Encounters.\" Jacobson, a psychic who teaches self actualization meditation for relaxation, commented on the importance of recognizing the spiritual implications of the UFO phenomenon. \"Through a relaxed state, we are able to more fully understand ourselves, as well,as the import of UFO activity,\" Jacobson said.

Ray Rhein, a MUFON Field Investigator and a retired engineer from Pfafftown, was the final speaker for the evening. ' He gave an extremely interesting illustrated talk on the topic \"The Spaceships of Ezekiel,\" where he correlated the Old Testament prophet Ezekiel's vision 2,500 years ago with our recent technological advances towards space travel. In essence, Rhein feels that the Bible tells of space ships, and the ones that Ezekiel encounters and his experiences sound identical to some of our own space programs and UFO visitations today. \"Scientists who examined Ezekiel's claims found out that they could duplicate the devices seen, that they would fly, and they also got a patent on their work and it will be incorporated during our own future space missions,\" Rhein concluded. The conference closed for the evening and all present enjoyed a reception hosted by Dr. and Mrs. Jayne Ware at their home. The Sunday sessions opened with an illustrated and well researched speech given by P. Wayne LaPorte of Matthews, a facilities industrial engineer who serves as a MUFON State Section Director. LaPorte's topic was \"UFOnauts: Major Types & Characteristics.\" LaPorte described many of the different types of UFO occupants encountered in Poland, California, West Virginia, New England, Mississippi, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Mexico, etc. He described the use of hypnosis, psychological stress evaluators (PSE), lie detectors, truth serum, and voice tape analyzers by scientists investigating these encounters, which involve many different type entities being seen. \"Some of the UFO entities seem to be able to take on the appearance of humans and perhaps live among us, while others appear to be sinister and frightening and more animal-like rather tha i human,\" LaPorte said. Cases number in the thousands. The final conference speaker was Carl Ruchte of Lewisville, a professional photographer by trade, whose topic was \"Fake Photographs.\" Ruchte said that people will see on photographs pretty much what they want to see and mentioned that he was extremely suspicious and skeptical if- UFO films he had seen to date. Ruchte Sgt. E.G. Baker, Winston-Salem Police Department (photo: Dennis Beck) told the audience about the different things to look for, such as grain structure, photos out of scale, light shadows, the placement of the subject matter, perspective, second or third generation UFO photographs, film defects, different camera and lens characteristics, etc. Ruchte said, \"If the time c&;nes when you see a UFO, try to remain calm and get as many shots from as many locations as possible and other witnesses as well. As soon as possible after the incident, you should sit down and write every bit of narrative data possible and then take them (the films) to the best processing place and keep the films inside the camera at all times on the way to the processor.\" Ruchte admitted not knowing about the computer enchancement photography studies being utilized by scientists of Ground Saucer Watch in Phoenix, Arizona. The speaker concluded that he would assist local investigators in their future investigations that involve UFO photogrpahs. The 1979 MUFON.NC 3rd Annual Leadership Training Conference then adjourned for a picnic hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Nolie L. Bell at their home. 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PRESERVING THE UFO LITERATURE: A STATUS REPORT By William E. Jones (MUFON Field Investigator) Over the past 30 years or so the UFO phenomenon has become a part of our 20th century history, if not a part of our science. No matter what one's view is concerning the reality of the UFO, the phenomenon is undeniably a real part of that history. During these past years many books, bulletins, journals, and other publications have appeared on the subject. Some of this material has been published by the major publishing houses and has been readily available. Unfortunately, however, most of it has been printed by small companies or private individuals and this material has not been so available. As a matter of fact, much of this material is now extremely hard to obtain and will become lost for all time if steps are not taken now to preserve it. An interesting part of our history is in danger of being lost. Over a year ago MUFON undertook a small project to identify libraries, universities, historical societies, and other similar institutions that would be willing to assist in the preservation of this material. It was decided early on that, in order to provide for adequate preservation and access, the material should be treated as \"rare.\" In other words, the collection should be stored in an area of limited access and used on a non-circulating basis, in the library itself as other such rare books and materials are used. Proper indexing is essential. MUFON has identified several institutions that are interested in this problem and are willing to take the necessary steps to .adequately preserve and make accessible this material. Mr. George M. Eberhart 1 , MUFON's librarian who is with the University of Kansas, School of Law Library, has been working with University Microfilms of Ann Arbor, Michigan, to try and interest them in 16 microfilming and making available a. greater array of UFO material than they presently handle. At present, they have available the UFO Investigator, the Canadian UFO Report, and Ray Palmer's Flying Saucers for 1973-76. It is hoped that, at the very least, they will add a complete set of the Skylook/MUFON UFO Journal to their collection. The Ohio State University Library, Special Collections Division, in Columbus, Ohio, has already started a special collection on ufology, using primarily my own material which was donated to them in April 1979. Mr. Robert Tibbets, who is the director of the division, is very interested in obtaining as much quality material as possible in this area. Columbia University in New York City has had an established collection for several years. This collection was the gift of Dr. Leon Davidson and covers the period between 1950 and 1970. Approximately 1,955 items are in this collection. A number of other libraries have expressed an interest in helping with this project. Their only problem is locating established collections in the hands of private collectors that can be used to start the effort. A current list of interested libraries follows: Columbia University c/o Butler Library New York, NY 10027 Attn: Mr. Kenneth A.

In order to keep these institutions interested, we need to start donating material. As a rule, most ufologists will be hesitant to give up their collections. However, there are still ways to help. If you are in a group that publishes a bulletin, one or more of these libraries can be added to the distribution list. If you have extra copies of bopks, journals, bulletins, and other items, these could be donated without reducing the quality of your research library.

A spectrofluorometer, operates by illuminating a sample in a small container with a particular frequency of light and then measuring the intensity and color of light given off by the sample.

Many ufologists spend years and a sizeable amount of money building up their UFO research library. This library becomes a real source of pride. By the proper use of a will, this library can remain intact long after the ufologist's death, continuing to serve the UFO research community of which the owner was once a part. If you are interested in using your will to dispose of your UFO library, see your attorney. It is always a good idea to preview your estate plan every few years anyway. The story of the UFO, as told in the literature that has come out over the last 30 years, is well worth preserving. Contact one of the institutions listed and let them know of your willingness to help. If these don't interest you, contact the library of the university you graduated from or the one nearest you and see if you can interest them. The more libraries and other institutions that we can get involved, the better our chances will be to preserve the literature of one of the most fascinating and challenging aspects of pur history — the search for the meaning of the UFO.

His figure 2 shows the photomultiplier, labelled PMT, in the upper left hand portion of the diagram. His statement that the photomultiplier by itself would allow one to identify spectra is incorrect. One needs a frequency (color) selective system and optics (a telescope) ahead of the PMT in order to be able to use the PMT (and associated recording electronics) to plot color spectra of distant sources such as UFOs. The impression that one gains from reading his article is that the PMT is a simple and inexpensive color analyzer. In actual fact, the PMT is not expensive (only $100 or so for a useable one), but the associated parts can run to thousands of dollars. The assembly of a photomultiplier system to spectrally analyze UFOs could be quite complicated, although if done correctly it would certainly provide useful data. A much simpler but nearly as effective (Book Review, Continued) and Dick realized that the entrapment of Robert Toth revealed that the Soviets took parapsychology very seriously; they rank it with nuclear, rocket, and other strategic secrets. Early in 1977 they began to stop the flow of psychic information to the West. Parapsychologists were no longer permitted to attend meetings in other countries. Also they were reevaluated, and some interviewed in this book have since come to grief. Briefly mentioned is the revelation in 1977 of the CIA's vast program for research on all types of mind control. The newspapers exposed CIA secret files by means of the Freedom of Information Act. Gris and Dick can read between the lines. This timely and well- presented book is packed with news, descriptions, and impressions that \"give one to think.\" It fills the gap between Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain and the present. Right now there is no possibility of learning more in the future.

Bruce S. Maccabee Silver Springs, Md. Editor, I am writing in response to the September 1979 Journal article \"How to 'Hear' and 'Fingerprint' UFO Light\" by Russ Reardon. Some things Mr. Reardon has said in his article are misleading and I believe they need to be pointed out. In his first paragraph and in the caption of his figure 2 he has made it sound as if a photomultiplier we're a large complicated device capable of doing a host of unique operations. The photomultiplier itself, the round schematic figure, left center of figure 2, designated as PMT, is very similar in construction to a standard radio tube and can do no more than convert a light signal to an electronic signal in a proportional manner. It is Only through sophisticated optics, filters, and state of the art electronics that the photomultiplier can be utilized to accomplish all Mr. Reardon has alluded to.. The circuit in figure 2 could surely be used to contour plot a light source and could also be caused to give an audible signal proportional to the light examined; but a photomultiplier cannot fingerprint or hear. From the second paragraph — hundreds of other light sources each have set wavelengths of light emissions (Angstroms) — all sources of light are measured in Angstroms. An angstrom is a unit of length; like an inch. They are not tangible, as the article makes them seem. One angstrom equals one-one hundred-millionth of a centimeter. I am certainly a proponent of new ideas and I hope Mr. Reardon keeps thinking, and that the same \"disease\" spreads throughout the UFO research and investigative community. Thpmas P. Deuley Ft.

In the midst of the investigation by Wendelle Stevens and his group, Mr. Meier said he had a contact during the night (his 105th), wherein he was given a small package of amber crystals delivered by \"Quetzal,\" expressedly for Stevens to have examined. Even though some of the photographs were submitted to photogrammetric analysis, each of the objects purported to be a UFO has a clear distinct edge, whereas the remainder of the photograph is out of focus whether in the distance or close up. There are four distinct types of craft (or models) depicted in these \"unusually beautiful color photographs.\" After receiving a complimentary copy of the book from Wendelle Stevens and studying its contents, I advised him in writing that I could not under any condition endorse the authenticity of material in the book and the bizarre claims made. by Bill Meier. At \"UFO 79,\" Jim Lorenzen, International Director of APRO, disclaimed any endorsement of the book which Stevens had previously implied in advertising literature. Only the naive attendees at \"UFO 79\" were impressed with the book, since it allegedly offers evidence or investigation into the credibility of the claims. If you are overwhelmed with Volume I at $24.95, be prepared to purchase Volumes II and III, which are promised. Need I say more? From your Director's viewpoint, this book could be one of the most damaging pieces of literature available to the skeptics, since they will have a \"field day\" on the lack of authenticity for its claims. Wendelle Stevens advised that they have published 10,000 copies. It has been estimated that this could consist of a $60,000 investment, which is a reasonable cost, considering the professional caliber of the processes involved. I am using this vehicle and occasion to make a personal statement concerning my evaluation of the book, before the skeptics have an opportunity to start making innuendos for lack of a public disclaimer. When one has been involved in the controversial field of UFOlogy for 30 years, all of the .evidence must be scrutinized, evaluated, and applied wherever feasible to the resolution of the phenomena. This requires an open mind to newly discovered scientific evidence that will help solve this enigma. If \"UFO...Contact From The Pleiades\" proves to be scientific fact, it would be the greatest \"breakthrough\" in modern UFOlogy. If my personal evaluation of this book is incorrect, I will be the first to apologize to Col Stevens for this statement. A new column titled \"UFO Secrecy Update\" by Larry W. Bryant was inaugurated in the October issue (No. 140) of the Journal. This was based on the decision to suspend publication of the newsletter JUST CAUSE due to lack of broad public support, limited operating funds, and the inability of such a specialized organization as CAUS to reach a wide enough audience for its message. Correspondence between Larry Bryant and your Director to negotiate an arrangement whereby the MUFON UFO Journal would fulfil the responsibilities of JUST CAUSE to its subscribers has been taking place for nearly 2 months. MUFON heartily endorses the fine work that Peter A. Gersten, Larry Bryant, and Brad Sparks have been doing regarding the lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In the meantime, Larry Bryant has been able to publish and distribute Vol. 1, No. 9 (December 1979) of JUST CAUSE to present subscribers. In Bronx, N.Y., on October 25, 1979, a press conference was held by CAUS legal director Peter A. Gersten to publicize the latest developments in the litigation of Ground Saucer Watch, Inc. vs. CIA; to highlight the plans of Gersten.to file (on behalf of CAUS) FOIA lawsuits against the National Security Agency and the Department of the Air Force; and to dramatize the concern of CAUS members and others that the Federal Government's apparent mishandling of legitimate, hard-core UFO data could endanger the national interest. , Since many JUST CAUSE subscribers are also MUFON members and receive the MUFON UFO Journal, we are using this medium to advise them that as of December 10, 1979, a financially satisfactory arrangement for merging JUST CAUSE with Journal subscribers has not been consum- mated. The Executive Committee of MUFON recommended several steps and alternatives to Mr. Bryant to alleviate their financial situation. The December 1979 issue of JUST CAUSE contains some of these recommend- ations. Since MUFON endorses the objectives of CAUS, we are seeking a workable compromise that will assist them in achieving their goals. (Letters, Continued) slightly shorter period of time. I do not find Messengers of Deception* to be paranoid. To me it states a possibility: that some humans are simulating the UFO phenomenon for their own purpose. As I understand the author's reasoning, there is both a \"real\" and a \"fake\" UFO phenomenon. How can we tell the difference? An interesting question. To me Vallee's research and investigations are original and significant. It won't do a bit of harm to ask yourself, after reading yet another tedious, personal and Freudian abduction report, \"Could this have been engineered (either physically, mentally, or a combination of both) by humans?\" What about UMMO, declared a hoax by Dr. Claude Poher? A lengthy,'expensive and serious hoax. Why? What about the Meier case, not yet accepted by researchers? Don't these arouse your suspicions? They do mine. A fresh point of view should not be attacked emotionally, but kept in mind as one more clue to the murky UFO mystery.

A UFO, traveling at 6,000 miles an hour, exploded over the Persian Gulf on August 24, 1979, according to an article in the November 6 issue. Another questionable report in the November 13 issue contends that UFO aliens are using Saturn's moon, Titan, as a base for their visits to Earth. Another feature in this same issue tells of Dr. Richard Niemtzow's research into the \"paralysis effect\" often noted in the vicinity of a UFO. The November 20 issue contains a report by an Indian physicist who claims that a tornado-like phenomenon near New Delhi, India, was actually the exhaust from a nuclear-powered UFO. THE STAR for October 23 features an article telling of mysterious noises and UFO sightings on the island of Bermuda. In a welcome change of pace, Harry Lebelson contributes the \"UFO Update\" column for the November issue of OMNI. Some very interesting information on UFO physical evidence is presented, including an update on the famous Ubatuba, Brazil, magnesium sample. The December issue of UFO REPORT features contributions by the late B. Ann Slate, Wayne Laporte, and others, including excerpts from Allan Hendry's THE UFO HANDBOOK. A special \"Collector's Edition\" of PROBE magazine is now available, containing several interesting UFO articles. California UFO researcher Richard Zimmerman is the editor of this edition and PROBE evidently intends to make a reappearance on newsstands as a regularly-scheduled publication. The #16 issue of TRUE UFOs & OUTER SPACE is helped somewhat by Bill Retoff s article on the 1979 National UFO Conference, held at Norwood, Ohio. Most of the remaining material in this issue is rehash. It takes little prophetic insight to predict that UFO...CONTACT FROM THE PLEIADES will shortly become a very controversial volume. The disputes and arguments will center around the photographs of alleged alien spacecraft, plus the fact that said photographs were taken by a Swiss farmer/caretaker who claims to have been in contact with UFO occupants for many years. The research into this case, spearheaded by Wendelle C. Stevens, has unearthed an amazing store of data. The present volume — one of a series of books on the case — concentrates on the photographs, while giving a brief summary of the contactee's claims, plus excerpts from alleged conversations with the \"Pleiadans.\" The photographs, genuine or not, are very impressive; more than a dozen are enlarged to 12\" X 12\", with others being 12\" X 24\". The book also contains photos of claimed spacecraft metal samples which have been supplied by the aliens. One must admire the perseverance of Stevens and the others who have labored hard and long to present this case to the public. Whatever one may think of the photos, the contact claims or the other evidence, these research efforts should not be ignored.

I would hope that this evidence will be given careful and serious consideration, rather than being automatically rejected because of its association with a contactee claimant. I Mark R.

It is 6 degrees north of Antares on the 18th. Venus — It is rapidly becoming easier to see, as the angle between the ecliptic and the horizon increases. It is low in the southwest at sunset, and sets about 2 hours later. Mars — In Leo, it rises in late evening, and is high in the southwest at sunrise. It is 1.7 degrees north of Jupiter on the 13th. Saturn is only 15 degrees further east, and the moon joins the array on the llth to 13th. Jupiter — In Leo, it rises in late evening and is high in the southwest at sunrise.

Speakers already confirmed are Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, University of Wyoming; Ray Stanford, Director of Project Starlight International; and Stanton T. Friedman, nuclear physicist and lecturer, who has titled his paper \"Flying Saucer Technology\" to fit the theme of the symposium. Two additional features of the program will be a tour of the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center on Sunday afternoon, June 8th, and an Advanced Propulsion Workshop, coordinated by Alan C. Holt. A separate article in the MUFON UFO Journal will detail the plans for this workshop and the dates for submitting abstracts to Alan C. Holt. Featured speakers are advised to submit their papers to Walt Andrus by March 1, 1980, for inclusion in the published 1980 Symposium Proceedings. Other featured speakers will be announced in the January issue of the Journal. The September 1979 (No. 50) issue of the Japanese newsstand magazine \"UFOs and Space\" has as it's lead story our Tenth Annual 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium in San Francisco, Calif., devoting three full pages of color photographs, a 5-page story with black and white photographs, and 9 pages to the presentation delivered by Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee on the New Zealand motion picture UFO sequence. It was a pleasant surprise to open the cover and find a color photograph of Peter Tomikawa shaking hands with your Director. The entire credit for this outstanding exposure must be given to Mr. Tomikawa for his photographs and articles, and to the Universe Publishing Co., Ltd., the publishers of UFOs and SPACE. The address of the publishing firm is Yamato Building, 5-1-6, Ueno, Taito-ku, Tokyo, Japan. The price of a single copy is 450 yen. In addition to this fine coverage, another page printed in English gave an overview of the symposium, the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON), and the announcement of our 1980 symposium to be held in Clear Lake City, Texas, on June 7 and 8. A second article of prime interest was a photographic introduction to the leaders of UFOlogy in Japan today. A brief resume accompanied the photographs of MUFON's three officers in Japan; Jun-Ichi Takanashi, National Director for Japan; Yu \"Masaru\" Mori, Deputy Director for the northern Japanese islands; and Takao Ikeda, Deputy Director for the southern Japanese islands. Several of the J.S.P.S. members who visited MUFON in August, pictured on the cover of the October 1979 issue of the Journal, are also featured in this same article, including Shinichiro Namiki, President of Japan Space Phenomena Society. The Royal Quality Inn in San Diego, Calif., was the site for \"UFO 79\" on the weekend of November 16, 17, and 18, sponsored by Hal Starr and R.H. Peck. The entire conference was videotaped for possible use on national television. The speakers in order of their appearance were Walter H. Andrus, Jr., \"A New Look at the UFO Entity Evidence\"; James A. Harder, Ph.D., \"Do UFO Aliens Communicate with Humans? — An Overview\"; Stanton T. Friedman, \"UFO Propulsion Systems\"; Alan C. Holt, \"Hydromagnetics and Close Encounters\"; L.J. \"Jim\" Lorenzen, \"UFOs and Cattle Mutilations\"; R. Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., \"UFO Prophesies\"; and Cleve Baxter, \"The Efficacy of the Polygraph in Determining the Validity of UFO Encounters.\" The informal Saturday evening banquet was devoted to honoring pioneers in the UFO organizational field, Donald E. Keyhoe, Major USMC (Ret.) and Coral E. Lorenzen, with complimentary expressions by Hal Starr, Chairman; J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D. via a prior videotape titled \"The Necessity for Cooperation Between UFO Study Groups\"; Coral E. Lorenzen; and Walt Andrus with a short tribute to Mrs. Lorenzen and Major Keyhoe. Due to the serious illness of his wife Helen, Major Keyhoe was unable to attend to accept the recognition due him as the former director of NICAP. Even though several speakers such as Bruce. S. Maccabee, Ph.D.; Marcel Vogel; J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D.; and Major Keyhoe were unable to attend for various reasons, the speaking program was a success. However, it was a disappointment that none of the demonstrations promised such as a new supersensitive magnetometer, photogrammetric analysis of pictures, and \"metal samples delivered by extra- terrestrials\" were available for the attendees to view Mr. Starr and Mr. Peck are to be congratulated for being very gracious hosts for this event. An even greater disappointment and a prime subject of discussion at \"UFO 79\" was the public introduction to the new book \"UFO...Contact From The Pleiades\" Volume I by Col. Wendelle C. Stevens and published by Genesis III Productions, Ltd. It is billed as \"The amazing photo-events and photo-experiences from the most startling case of ongoing Alien Contact to appear in modem history.\" Eduard \"Billy\" Meier claims to have had more than 130 meetings with the Pleiadian cosmonauts (named Ptaah, Quetzel, Semjase, Asket, and Plaja), made 600- (continued on page 18)"}]
