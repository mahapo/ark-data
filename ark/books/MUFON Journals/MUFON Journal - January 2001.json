Thompson Nebula Editor Submitted by Murray Bott, MUFON National Director for New Zealand In December 1984, a package was received at the home of Jaime Shandera, a Los Angeles TV producer and writer. It contained a roll of unprocessed 35mm film, which when printed proved to reveal photo- graphs of allegedly secret government documents that described the recovery of a crashed extraterrestrial craft from the New Mexico desert in 1947. Specifically, the documents were (purportedly) a memo from President Truman to Secretary of De- fense Forrestal, authorizing him to begin \"Operation Majestic 12\"; a seven-page memo to President-elect Eisenhower, apprising him of the state of Majestic 12's operations in studying (and covering up) the New Mexico crash; and a memo from Robert Cutler, an assistant to President Eisenhower, to Air Force Chief of Staff Nathan Twining. For various reasons most people have concluded these documents are total fakes. Their provenance is unknown, there are serious errors in their prepara- tion and structure, and their claims are often at odds with known historical facts. Since the release of the Majestic 12 story ten years ago, the phantom cabal of military men and scien- tists has become a staple of UFO lore, even figuring in the TV series \"Dark Skies\" as the secret group that runs the whole United States from behind the scenes. A most relevant question might be: Where did it come from? There are leading candidates for the du- bious honor of having created the bogus documents, but it's not my purpose here to point fingers. If read- ers are curious and research the available literature, they will recognize who the suspects are. My pur- pose here is to suggest what non-UFO influences in- spired the hoaxers to create the mysterious Majestic 12. Magic ciphers and Majestic forgeries In the documents, two coded abbreviations are used in place of the full name \"Majestic 12,\" namely \"MJ12\" and \"Majic.\" Use of the latter is particularly interesting, as it represents, I think, a deliberate at- tempt to link the phony UFO cover-up group to a real secret operation known as \"Magic.\" Thus people who knew something about the history of intelligence operations in the 1940s could link the two labels in their minds, and the real Magic would lend credence to the phony Majic. \"Magic\" was the cover name used for the decipher- ment of the Japanese diplomatic code machine in 1940. The Japanese had introduced an advanced new cipher machine, the Type 97, or \"Bei Gwa\" (\"B\" Machine) in 1937 to safeguard their diplomatic messages from for- eign eyes. The lead designer of the Bei Gwa was Captain (later Rear Admiral) Jinsaburo Ito, who departed from the usual mechanics of rotor-operated cipher machines (like the German Enigma) to incorporate rotary stepping switches into the mechanism. The stepping switches introduced further transpositions into the encipherment process of up to ten to the fifth power (10x10x10x10 x 10). The Japanese believed the Bei Gwa was impervi- ous to decipherment. Such was not the case. An American team of cryptoanalysts, led by the brilliant William F. Friedman, began attacking the Bei Gwa messages in 1938. Using advanced statistical methods Friedman pioneered, the Americans soon determined the nature of the Japanese code machine, but it took them two years to crack the code. The breakthrough came when a young Army cryptologist, Harry Lawrence Clark, theorized that the Japanese could not be using rotors in their machine, and deduced that stepping switches were the key. After that, a trial machine was lashed together in great secrecy, and the Bei Gwa cipher was compromised. The American cover name for the Bei Gwa cipher was \"Purple.\" Rear Admiral Walter S. Anderson, head of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) in 1940, gave the cracking of \"Purple\" the code name \"Magic.\" This was a whim- sical label at that time, a reference to both the incred- ible brilliance of the cryptanalysts, as well as the secre- tive occult flavor that has clung to cryptography since the Middle Ages. Individual Japanese messages, once deciphered, were called \"magics,\" with a lower case M. People who had access to \"Purple\" messages were known as \"Ultras.\" Because of extreme sensitivity of the knowledge that the Bei Gwa had been broken, \"Magic\" also became a security classification, much higher than Top Secret. The entire advantage gained by reading Japanese messages would be lost if the Japanese learned the Bei Gwa was compromised. So convinced were the Japanese of the infallibility of the B Machine, they never abandoned it, even when evidence came their way that the Americans had pen- etrated it. The story of Magic remained a national secret for some time after the war, as did the British-French- Polish solution of the German Enigma cipher machine."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 January 2001 MUFON UFO Journal By the 1960s books began to appear about the crack- ing of \"Purple\": Ladislas Farago's The Broken Seal and David Kahn's The Codebreakers, both in 1967. In 1970 a major semi-documentary film, \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" was released which dramatically depicted the operation of \"Magic,\" the security surrounding it, and the small group of American leaders who knew about it. A few words about code names, and how the U.S. military uses them. During World War II, the cre- ation of code names was systematized, and lists of approved codenames were compiled into books for official use. Codenames were never re-used, and sometimes an operation could be renamed if its pur- pose changed or its security was compromised. Thus the invasion of North Africa was called \"Torch,\" the Normandy operation \"Overlord,\" etc. In the \"cameraman's statement\" associated with the alien autopsy film, it was alleged that the recovery of alien bodies in the desert in 1947 was codenamed \"Anvil,\" but it was soon pointed out that \"Anvil\" was the first codename for the invasion of southern France in 1944. Lo and behold, \"Anvil\" disappeared from printed versions of the so-called cameraman's state- ment. It would be interesting to research the archives to see if the codename \"Majestic\" was allocated to any operation in World War II. The hoaxer(s) who created the Majestic 12 docu- ments knew enough history to include prominent gen- erals and real scientists on the list of purported mem- bers. They also rather carefully chose 12 men who were all dead by 1984 and thus could not deny ever being members of MJ12. The most unusual member (from the UFO point of view) was Dr. Donald Menzel, the Harvard astrono- mer who published a couple of sarcastic and superfi- cial debunking books about UFOs. When a little dig- ging uncovered the \"revelation\" that Menzel had done work for some intelligence bureaus during the war and possibly after, this was hailed as proof he was a member of MJ12, and indeed proof that MJ12 really existed. The plain fact is, almost all scientists in the U.S. had some role in the war and cold war that followed, either in actual research and development or as con- sultants on matters in which they were experts. Menzel's intelligence career is scarcely startling to anyone who understands how America's national re- sources were marshalled during the war. Magic vs. \"Majic\": a comparison So how much did the MJ12 hoaxer(s) draw upon the real story of \"Magic\"? Short of their confession, there's no way to know, but the parallels make useful comparisons: \"Majic\" claims: ditto ditto \"alien\" technology, \"alien\" bodies ditto \"majic\"\"MJ12,\" etc. MJ12 continues to study aliens even after the New Mexico crash; MJ12 exists today Photocopies sent to Jaime Shandera, an associate of William Moore and Stanton Friedman,well known UFO researchers who previously published a book on the Roswell In cident. These parallels amply demonstrate the possible inspira- tion by the historic \"Magic\" to the false \"Majic.\" Coupled with the lack of provenance and the errors in the docu- ments themselves, there seems no reason to regard the MJ12 documents as anything but fiction—and failed fic- tion, at that. \"Magic\" history: The most secret operation in the US, even more so than the A-bomb project. Access highly restricted for security reasons. Involved new technology and advanced scientific analysis. Those in the know include high ranking military men and top scientists.

Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region New Jersey triangle WALDWICK — Joe Furando writes, \"On the evening of November 22,2000, at 12:05 PM, I was on my way home to Montvale when I spotted an unusu- ally bright light just over the western tree-line. I be- came concerned when I realized how low it was fly- ing. I slowed down and brought the car to a stop to get a better look. The shape was triangular and this was NO plane. \"It had a low, quiet jet engine sound almost inau- dible over the sounds of the cars on Route 17. It was mov- ing slow, and I got out of the car as it flew overhead! It was flying just over the trees and was a solid triangle, with red and green lights and two closely placed very bright white lights towards the center of the craft. It was so close to the ground, I could even make out the small bump in the back where it should have been flat like a triangle. It followed Sheridan Avenue south and di- rectly back toward Waldwick. The double lights were striking!\" Thanks to Joe Furando, jfurando@hotmail.com Ohio triangle OREGON — The witness reports, \"I was sitting in my living room Thanksgiving morning watching TV, when I heard an unusual slow low frequency modulating hum. I looked through the sheer drapes and noticed quite a few lights directly east moving northbound. When I parted the drapes, I had expected either helicopters or planes, but was stunned by the enormity of the 'one' triangular object that I saw. \"The object was bigger than a football field, had one red light in the bottom middle with smaller white lights in each of the corners. It was charcoal gray to black and surrounded by a dull orangey faint glow. \"It moved slower than stall speed for an aircraft in a northeastern direction. It just cleared a radio tower, of which there are several in the direction it was headed. The hum sound it emitted was neither a prop nor jet engine, as I am familiar with both of these. I am a 38-year-old music teacher, and have programmed sounds on synthesizers regularly, and relate it to a low modulating frequency with a slow sweeping resonance effect. \"I used up a little time trying to look for a camera, and decided to give up the search for one, and step outside to get a better look. By the time I was outdoors it took about 20 seconds to disappear over the north- eastern neighborhood rooftops. The conditions that morning were overcast, and still dark out at 6:30 AM.\" Thanks to Kenny Young. ufo@FUSE.NET (Kenny Young) Louisiana triangle ELM GROVE - on Nov. 27,2000, a Triangle shaped craft flying at 3,000 feet altitude, heading northeast was sighted at 10:30 PM by two witnesses. It had bright white lights on all \"ends\" of the triangle and bright smaller red light off center of the object. The husband was ex-military and familiar with vari- ous aircraft, but could not identify the object. The ob- ject had an extremely loud \"droning\" sound. The ob- ject was the size of a thumbnail at arm's length. The husband was in his office when he heard the craft and went on the back porch to observe. There was an ex- traordinary amount of air-traffic that day with \"angel hair\" falling for good part of day. The couple observed 10 similar triangle craft awhile back and reported them. Those craft also had the same droning sound, same shape, altitude, and direction heading. The unusual \"droning\" is what first drew at- tention. Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC www.ufocenter.com Oklahoma triangle YUKON — Shelley Ritter, MUFON field investi- gator, reports, \"On Dec. 4, 2000, my friend and I went for a walk at 7:30 PM, when we noticed this huge, black solid triangular shaped craft. It was silently hov- ering over Yukon at 45 degrees above the horizon. On the back end of the craft was a pulsating red light that moved from right to left. We ran to my house to grab my binoculars to get a better look. \"We saw yellow, white, blue and green lights un- derneath of this craft, but I couldn't see how the lights were fixed because of distortion. It started heading east, so we jumped into my truck and drove to Czech Hall Road, but it had disappeared from sight. It was the size of a city block square or larger. I have a sketch of what we saw that night.\" Thanks to Shelley Ritter bbbritter@aol.com Canadian intercept BRITISH COLUMBIA — Lt. Col Charles D. writes, \"I had a very interesting incident involving a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 January 2001 MUFON UFO Journal UFO while flying an F-102 in 1958. While on alert duty with the 318th in British Columbia, we scrambled to intercept two bogies on a 90 degree heading. While being vectored to the location, I observed a white light. I was flying on a 270 heading and the light was to my 1300 position. The light continued towards my aircraft. \"As it approached, I noticed the light had a fuselage body behind it. Just prior to the light hitting my air- craft it veered to the south. My partner also observed it. After identifying the two bogies as Canadian civil- ian aircraft, we returned to base. While positioning my aircraft for final approach, I again observed this white light directly ahead of me. I believe the runway we were using was 29, so that would have put the light at about the same heading. After landing, we were debriefed inside the Combat Alert Control (CAC). We were told that radar at Elaine Air Force Station also picked up this white light (ob- ject). I never did find out what it was.\" Cigar-shaped object sighted in Poland LODZ — Tomasz Wierszaowicz writes, \"John, while driving, saw a UFO on Dec. 1, 2000, near War- saw in central Poland. The UFO was the shape of a cigar at about three kilometers distant. The large cigar was observed at sunset in a clear sky and no clouds. \"John could see the reflection of the sun on the ob- ject. He stopped his car to watch the object, which stayed in the same position in the sky for an extended period. He also saw two white streams coming from the object towards the ground in a 'V shape. The white streams sometimes were shorter, sometimes longer. We expect more detailed information.\" Three new planets found SOUTHERN SKY - A group of southern astrono- mers have found three new planets orbiting stars simi- lar to our sun. The three new planets are 150 light- years from Earth. They are the first to be found by the Anglo-Australian Telescope in Australia. One of the new planets is a gas giant, about the size of Jupiter. It is circling Epsilon Reticulum in the \"habitable region\" of its parent star, suggesting liquid water could exist on the planet's surface. The smallest of the newly-discovered planets is an object called a \"hot Jupiter\" because it sits just six million kilometers from its parent star, HD179949, in the constellation Sagittarius. The planet, with a mass that's 84 per cent of our Jupiter, orbits the star in only three days. The third of the new planets is almost twice as mas- sive as Jupiter and circles a star called mu Ara, in the constellation Altar. The discovery brings the total num- ber of known exoplanets to more than fifty. New York object LONG ISLAND — Sheryl Wade writes, \"I read George King's sighting on Easter morning 1999. I'm responding because very early Easter morning, I was looking at the moonless sky in a northeastern direc- tion at 12:15 AM when an object flew over my head just above the trees. The amazing part is that if I wasn't looking up I would have never seen it. It was big, fast, and quietly moving southwest towards Amityville. \"That same morning something crashed right off the Southern State Parkway at Exit 32 that took down trees in a field and accomplished a lot of damage to the land. They quickly tried to plant new vegetation and blocked off from the public what happened. It was chalked off in the news as a meteor. Thanks to Sheryl Wade, mi gente @ earthli nk. net. New Jersey teardrop-shaped object EAST BRUNSWICK — Ed Nolan writes, \"I am a stock room manager for a retail store, so was in the process of removing trash todumpsters located directly behind the store at 4:35 PM in late November. My helper and ! were walking back to the rear door when I noticed a black object that appeared at first to be a balloon coming over the tree line moving east. \"As it came closer it took on a teardrop shape. It flew directly over us, and dipped its nose at us, reveal- ing that it was not round, but was in fact a craft of some sort. It was all black with two fins running the length of it. It was an elliptical shape as viewed head on, similar to the body of the SR-71 Blackbird air- craft. \"Because there were clouds overhead, it was very easy to see the black object. It was like nothing we had ever seen before. I am very familiar with every known aircraft type in the world, and this was definitely not a known aircraft. Once it was directly overhead at 300 feet it was obvious to us that it was either extraterres- trial, or a government black-ops craft. \"It never changed speed or altitude, but did do the dip and wobble when directly over our heads, afford- ing us to get a good look at it. We have had no ill effects from our encounter, other than to say to each other, \"They are real!\" Martin an engineering student at Rutgers University also saw the object. Airplanes were also seen at the same time.\" V-shaped object reported WEST ALLENHURST — On Thanksgiving evening Nov. 23, 2000, the witness observed a V- shaped and crescent-shaped dull or faint orangey/pink lights crossing the sky. She reports, \"At 6:15 PM, four of us were getting in our car. As my husband was un- locking the car I was gazing up to the sky and noticed"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2001 Page 7 a faint light crossing the sky. I continued to look and I noticed that there were 6 or 7 faint lights in a V shape. I called to my family to look up to the sky and they all saw it as well. \"We watched as it silently crossed the sky. As we drove, I continued looking up and saw the same type of faint lights, but now there were 8 to 10 'lights' in an arc or crescent shape. \"Even though the 'lights' were faint, the 'object' appeared relatively close compared to planes that you see in the sky. There was no sound either time, and there was a hint of a 'shadow' where the body of this craft would be. \"The dull lights were orangey/pinkish on both of the sightings and were steady, not blinking or flash- ing, heading in a southerly direction.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director of the National UFO Reporting Center www.ufocenter.com. Disc-shaped objects spotted in Georgia ATLANTA — Several disc-shaped objects were seen moving north at 9:30 PM across the sky on Nov. 23, 2000. The witness reports, \"The discs were bright at the onset, then slowly faded away similar to a re- flecting light that moved away from the light source. The first sighted group of two objects was followed by a formation of about 8 to 12 UFOs. Then a pause and then a new formation of UFOs were repeated several times. \"The discs were moving against the wind in the up- per atmosphere and above the cloud cover. The fading away of the objects could have been due to the clouds. It is not possible to determine if the brightness of the objects was due to their own light or if it was reflec- tion from the sun. The objects were disc-shaped as seen with low-powered binoculars. There was no noise, but this may have been due to the distance. I am a scientist with a Ph.D. in biochemistry.\" A second sighting in Georgia ATLANTA — Formations of between 2 and 12 disc- shaped white-yellow lights (as seen with binoculars), at first bright as they appeared in the sky, then dim- ming as they were moving north-northeast. All seemed to be of identical shape and size. In total, over 50 of these lights were seen by three scientists (including one B.S. and two Ph.D.s), and two professional high tech people (including an MBA graduate from Harvard University), and by a 13-year girl. The last formation disappeared behind clouds which started to move into the area. The whole epi- sode lasted for about 15 minutes. Saucer shape in Georgia DALTON — The witness reports, \"I was driving around my neighborhood about 7:15 PM onNov. 27, 2000, when I saw what seemed to be two bright lights about a quarter of a mile away above the tree tops. I drove towards the object, trying to get a better vantage point to identify it. As I got within 500 feet, I got the scare of my life. It was a saucer-shaped craft that was about 70 to 80 feet in diameter hovering 100 feet over a house. \"It had two bright lights on each side of the disc and many multicolored lights between. None of the lights were blinking. I rolled down the window to listen, but it did not make any sound at all. I had slowed down to about 5 mph when the craft, which had been hovering on a horizontal axis, slowly turned onto a vertical axis and very slowly moved off towards the southwest. \"As it moved off I noticed what looked to be a very weak bluish light emitting from what previously was the top and bottom of the saucer when it was hovering horizontally. The color of the craft was gunmetal gray or black, since it was dark and the lights on it were bright, but they were not illuminating it like I would have expected them to. \"After it had moved over the treeline I did not see it again. I saw this object at a very close range, and it was the most awesome thing that I had ever seen. I am a very credible and intelligent 32-year-old in great health and have 20/15 vision in both eyes. This was not a common object. This was a real craft that was made and operated by intelligent beings. Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC, www.ufocenter.com Disc sighted in Nebraska LINCOLN — Scott Colborn related this story to me while we were on the air on his radio show \"Exploring Unexplained Phenomena\" on KZUM 89.3 and Lincoln Cable TV #10. On November 30, 2000, a farmer heard his dogs barking very loudly on a farm off Highway 2. The bark- ing was the kind the dogs made when a car approached their home. The witness looked outside and noticed a very bright light in his field around 7:00 PM. He de- cided to walk over to the field, and invited his dogs to join him. Normally, they were always willing to go for a walk, but they were afraid and refused to go. The farmer walked to a grove of trees on the edge of his field, but the lights that had been very bright, sud- denly blacked out. Since the field was now dark, he decided not to go further and returned to his home. His dogs acted very violently toward him and did not seem to recognize him, so he ran into his home. He ran up to the second floor and used his binocu- lars to search the field. The lights were now on again,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS January 2001 MUFON UFO Journal and he could see a disc-shaped object. He focused his binoculars better and was able to see portholes or win- dows in the disc, that he calls \"a unit.\" He noticed movement in a thicket near the disc. Suddenly some- thing moved quickly from the thicket to the unit. Shortly thereafter the object brightened and took off. He has been very busy and has so far not checked the field for landing traces.

Arizona formation of triangles AVONDALE — The witness reports, \"I was going to the backyard on Dec. 1, 2000, when I turned to the southwest, towards \"South Mountain,\" and I saw a whole bunch of lights in the shape of one big triangle at 6:45 PM. There seemed to be helicopters flying along side the flying triangle that looked like they were pro- tecting it. The sky was sort of pinkish purple that day.\" Teardrop-shaped object reported VAIL — \"My son-in-law and daughter witnessed a large glowing teardrop-shaped craft flying very low at almost 100 meters off the ground on Nov. 4, 2000. They drove toward it the craft flashing their lights. The craft \"doubled\" it's height, and started to move west along the railroad tracks. The sighting was near a new golf course two miles north of I-10 Interstate. \"As the craft moved west, two A-10 fighter aircraft tried to follow it. It increased in speed and lost the A- 10 aircraft. The color of the craft was a \"glow in the dark\" light green/white. It had a red light at \"pointed\" aft end. It was encircled with different colored lights around the perimeter. It made no noise during any movement. My daughter says that there was a dark area, like a windshield on the upper \"dome.\" My son in law is an electrician and my daughter is waitress.\" Another Arizona triangle On Nov. 28, 2000, Jason Ingraham reported seeing a mass in the shape of a flying triangle with a deep red light on each point that three lights would blink on an off together. Around 7:00 PM Jason observed it mov- ing northwest for about 10 seconds when the object began to lean to the left and began to rotate in a clock- wise motion. \"I was able to watch it long enough to see it make a full rotation before disappearing behind some distant trees,\" he reports. \"The movements were so smooth and unwavering thatit seemed unreal. There were six normal airplanes in the sky along with the very different flying triangle.\" Disc reported in Florida NORTH MIAMI BEACH - At 6:42 PM, on Nov. 28, 2000, the witness observed an object like a plate with an upside down cup in the top. The disk had yellow, white and red lights at the bottom. Some of the lights were steady and others were blinking at the top. The witness stated, \"I just remember seeing some- thing around the object, but not too close. They looked like stars to me, but they were following the object. There were at least three of these little things. \"I watched it through a window. It was bright in some parts. The lights also had some kind of move- ment or perhaps the object itself had some kind of ro- tation. The disk was north of me and it was moving west, but when I came out of the apartment to see it again, it was gone. Although I saw it for only 35 sec- onds I can still see it in my mind's eye.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC www.ufocenter.com Illinois triangle PEORIA — Two objects were seen over the down- town area on Nov. 28,2000. The witness reports, \"Each had four bright white lights on them. The first one con- densed into one light and suddenly disappeared. The second one was in a wide V formation. It was very low to the ground. Too low to be an airplane. It almost looked like it was going to graze the tops of the Peoria buildings. Then it condensed into one light and disap- peared. The UFOs were against the orange glow of the city lights and were very easy to see. Normally, I would not report something like this but my wife is a skeptic, and when she saw this she absolutely freaked. She encouraged me to report this so I did.

Rob said, \"Come here and look at this.\" Dar looked and exclaimed, \"That's a UFO!\" She immediately ran outside saying, \"Grab your camera, it's a huge ship!\" Rob grabbed his equipment and ran out to the creek and saw a huge UFO about 1000 feet off the ground. Rob started to video the UFO. That's when two ships appeared. Rob said, \"It was not one, but two. It started to shine a beam of light down on the ground and started moving towards us. It stopped, and all of a sudden one ship blinked and disappeared.\" Rob continued to observe the craft. He came into the house and called a friend and asked him to go out- side to see if he could also see the UFO. The friend also saw the craft and Rob again went outside and it was still there.

In fact, they experience some unique forms of stress very much like that experienced by explorers, research scientists, and entre- preneurs. Ufologists are busy collect- ing data associated with anomalous events, interfacing with research institutions and government agencies, dealing with the most varied popula- tions of humans possible, lack- ing sufficient funding and sup- port, and usually doing this as an unpaid second job. These factors naturally subject ufologists to additional forms of stress that they would not otherwise experience. Why do some individuals handle the stress better than others? How can UFO organizations help their workers deal with stress? Are there some common sense steps available to ufologists for stress relief? This paper pro- vides answers to these questions and more. What causes stress? Stress results from the interaction between a person and his or her environment. It appears when there is a discrepancy between the demands made upon a per- son and his/her perceived ability to respond to these demands. Stress can result from both positive and nega- tive events. Some thoughts about dealing with stress We live in an ever-changing world. That means change is natural, but that same change is what pro- duces the demands on people that results in the stress in their lives. Since change is an evolutionary process, dealing with it requires patience with one's self and others, education and learning, and the passage of time. If a person can stand out as assured, oriented, edu- cated, in control, and conforming to high standards as a source of honor, strength, and maturity, then that person will be able to deal with stress in a healthy and productive way. Individuals can be as stressed or stress-free as they decide to be. Start by diagnosing what is going on that is causing stress. Then take responsibility for your own ac- tions. Realize that it is not your job to fix everything or do everything. Since stress is natural and can be either posi- tive or negative, your job is to manage stress to a com- fortable level. Our society tends to drive people to seek instant gratification in everything we do. There is also a ten- dency to expect others to do whatever it takes to help us achieve this instant gratification. This isn't likely to happen very often, so it becomes a source of frustra- tion and disappointment. Happiness is key to stress reduction, and you are as happy as you decide to be. Be a beacon of light-have a positive outlook. Celebrate your accomplishments and try to catch other people doing things right. Don't dwell on the negative outcomes. Do not despair. Your ca- pacity to respond will match any challenge that may confront you. Joy gives us wings! In times of joy our strength is more vital, our intellect keener, and our understanding less clouded. We seem better able to cope with the world and to find our sphere of usefulness. But when sadness visits us we become weak, our strength leaves us, our comprehension is dim, and our intelligence veiled. Some sources of stress for ufologists While the methods addressed in this paper may be useful for dealing with the normal sources of stress such as job, family, illness, death, divorce, marriage, retirement, finances, and other normal stress-produc- ing events, I will only address some of the specific sources of stress experienced by ufologists, as follows: 1. Too many UFO reports 2. Too few UFO reports 3. Lack of access to the latest tools for detection and identification of UFOs 4. Lack of the necessary funds to travel and conduct extended investigations 5. Lack of time 6. Debunkers 7. Critics 8. Employers/employment 9. Experts and their egos 10. Communications 11. Government cover-up 12. Public appearances 13. Other Dealing with ufological-related stress Ufologists must deal with some unique stress-gen- erating situations. Whether or not they are successful in dealing with these situations will depend on their"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 January 2001 MUFON UFO Journal response to stress in general, plus some knowledge and understanding about the cause of ufological-related stress. Because we are all unique individuals, there is no \"one size fits all\" approach to stress management. However, the following information may be useful in forming your own approach to ufological-related stress. Too many UFO reports: While this may not seem like a big problem to everyone, some people are frus- trated by it. If you live in an area where UFOs are fre- quently reported, you may feel over-worked and un- der appreciated. A single UFO incident can take hun- dreds of hours to properly investigate and document. It all begins with a report by a witness to the media, police, or UFO organization. Then you must locate and contact the witnesses, do a screening interview, and then visit the site of the in- cident. Site visits may lead to additional witnesses. Collecting and safeguarding physical evidence is an important part of the job as well. Seeking possible ex- planations can take as much time as the basic data collection phase of the investigation, and often involves revisiting the site and original witnesses. Before the case is ready for peer review or closure, the job of docu- menting every facet of the case can take a lot of time. If you are in a \"hot\" area, You may get additional reports while you are still working on the first inci- dent. Often, the tendency is to jump on the new case and put the original one on hold because a fresh case can be more exciting than the grunt-work phase of the original case. After this happens two or three times, you may be getting very frustrated at the workload you are seeing and the lack of closure on any of the inci- dents. As a result, many good cases never get past the investigator's notebook or tape recorder. There is a simple solution to this problem. It is called teamwork. Sharing the workload with other investiga- tors can drastically reduce the frustration-induced stress. In addition, it can result in a faster, more com- plete investigation. There is a lot of common sense in the old adage, \"Two heads are better than one.\" Too few UFO reports: Some areas of the world seem to have very few UFO reports. Whether this is because there is no agency available to collect the re- ports, or it is against the sociological norm for the area, or UFOs are not seen is not relevant to the stress man- agement issue. When a person becomes a UFO investigator, he/she expects to conduct investigations. That is why time and energy is spent to become a certified investigator. Having nothing to investigate is as frustrating as hav- ing too many reports to investigate. The stress caused by this situation may be relieved by using the time to study past cases, get familiar with the history of ufology in your area, establish contacts with the police, weather, military and business officials, and develop a well-stocked field investigator's kit. Also, through networking you may establish contacts where you can assist other investigators in UFO hot spots. Lack of access to the latest tools for detection and identification of UFOs: It is unusual for a volunteer UFO investigator to begin his/her quest with a fully outfitted investigator's kit. Usually, the kit is devel- oped a piece at a time as the investigator's budget per- mits, and generally consists of a field meter, camera, video recorder, Geiger counter, and a few other items. Even then, the investigator may never have the funds available to buy expensive pieces of analytical equip- ment or have access to well-stocked research laborato- ries. Lacking the proper tools to do the job is a very frus- trating situation. This is especially true when the in- vestigator encounters physical evidence in a case and has no way to determine what that evidence means. It is also frustrating to know that most military installa- tions, national laboratories, private laboratories, and universities have tons of equipment capable of provid- ing the answers we are seeking, and we have no way to get them involved in the investigation. The stress reliever in this instance is a bit more dif- ficult to find. Initially, you must be satisfied you have done everything you can do, and be proud of that ac- complishment. However, by following the industry technique of \"continuous improvement,\" you can build on your suc- cesses by teaming with other investigators having ac- cess to additional facilities; developing contacts in lo- cal businesses that can assist with laboratory work; af- filiating with local police agencies to tap their forensic capabilities; and perhaps eventually establishing a working relationship with government agencies to gain their technical support. ' Lack of the necessary funds to travel and con- duct extended investigations: UFO reports can occur anywhere. Many reports come from remote areas of the state or country. This means the closest investiga- tor may be miles away from the scene of the incident. Since a thorough investigation may take days or even weeks to complete, this means the investigator must be financially able to establish a base near the scene of the incident and remain there until the investigation is finished, or make numerous trips to the scene. Since few investigators are independently wealthy, taking the dollars from the family budget for an ex- tended stay or repeated trips can be very stressful to the investigator and his/her family. It may even mean that the annual family vacation must be aborted in fa- vor of the investigation, something that is never for- gotten by the family members. Since money problems are very high on the list of stress makers for most people, this can be a difficult situation to"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2001 Page 11 face. Again, however, it is important for the investigator to do the best job he/she can do, while minimizing the impact on the family. Celebrate the success of the inves- tigation even if it cannot be as extensive of you would like it to be. This may be a situation where teamwork is almost mandatory in order to accomplish the whole investi- gation. With several people on the case, it can go much faster and require less time in the field. One team mem- ber can handle the witness interrogations while another is collecting and documenting physical evidence and another is working with local police and county agen- cies. To reduce costs even more, the team may choose to camp out in the field during the investigation. And last but not least, the Mutual UFO Network headquarters, the National Institute for Discovery Sci- ence, or other groups may be able to help with the field work by assisting with the cost of the investigation, supplying additional field investigators, and helping with the laboratory analysis of the physical evidence. Such teamwork can significantly reduce the investigator's out-of-pocket expenses. Lack of Time: In our fast-paced society, we all feel the pressure of too much to do and too little time to get it all done. For the ufologist, this can be highly stress- ful because many ufologists work at full-time jobs, have family and societal duties, and still conduct extensive UFO investigations. Initially, this can be a devastating problem for ufologists. The drive to do a good investigation can become so intensive that work and family duties can suffer. The answer to this problem is found in main- taining a balance. It is the same as maintaining a bal- ance between work and family life. For the ufologist, however, the balance must include a third factor-the UFO investigations. Debunkers: I have heard it said that the most frus- trating and least useful aspect of ufology is the machi- nations of the debunkers. Debunkers are experts at the use of disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda. They provide prosaic explanations for everything. If the first story gets challenged, they simply generate another story, and do not even apologize for changing their position. No information or data supplied by the ufologist is ever good enough for them. Truth, honesty, ethics, and things like that are foreign to their way of operating because it might erode their position. They seldom do real investigations. Most of their explanations are canned and used over and over so that they do not feel it necessary to do investigations. All this is very frus- trating to the ufologists that conduct extensive investi- gations, record every little detail of a UFO incident, assemble statistics, maintain vast databases, and prob- ably most of all, respect the good and honest witnesses who report their UFO incidents. Perhaps it would help ufologists to deal with the debunkers if they understood why the debunkers act in such a manner. This is best described in The Argument Culture, a book by Georgetown University professor Deborah Tannen. These machinations are an example of what the cultural linguist Walter Ong calls \"agonism\" or \"programmed contentiousness.\" Agonism does not refer to disagreement, conflict, or vigorous dispute. It refers to ritualized opposition. Professor Tannen says, \"The way we train our stu- dents, conduct our classes and our research, and ex- change ideas at meetings and in print are all driven by our ideological assumption that intellectual inquiry is a metaphorical battle. Following from that is a second assumption, that the best way to demonstrate intellec- tual prowess is to criticize, find fault, and attack.\" Further, she says, \"Many aspects of our academic lives can be described as agonistic. For example, in our scholarly papers, most of us follow a conventional framework that requires us to position our work in opposition to someone else's, which we prove wrong. The framework tempts-almost requires-us to oversim- plify or even misrepresent others' positions, cite the weakest example to make a generally reasonable work appear less so, and ignore facts that support others' views, citing only evidence that supports our own po- sitions.\" This approach \"fosters a stance of arrogance and narrow-mindedness.\" There is much more of value in The Argument Culture, but in these few words, I be- lieve Professor Tannen has clearly exposed the oper- ating mode used by most debunkers. With this information in mind, it is fairly obvious that we are stuck with a continuing tirade by the de- bunkers, and it will continue until they all die off. They are unable to change-they are programmed to act as they do. Fortunately, most ufologists have no desire to play the debunkers game. Programmed contentiousness is viewed as dishonest, unfair, and unethical. It puts an end to exploring ideas, uncovering nuances, compar- ing and contrasting different interpretations of a par- ticular work, and gaining a deeper and more accurate understanding of the material. It kills the quest for open- minded inquiry. Even knowing all of this, ufologists still allow them- selves to be stressed by the actions of debunkers. A good investigator is likely to be provoked by a debunker's announcement that a certain UFO was ac- tually Venus when everyone knows that Venus was not visible at the time. A debunker's demand for \"all of your investigative files so I can identify the UFO\" is another provoking ploy. They play on your ego by saying, \"I have never"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 January 2001 MUFON UFO Journal seen any credible evidence of a UFO,\" hoping you will try to provide some evidence that will convince them. Will it convince them? No! Their debunker's pre-sub- scribed dogma will not allow it. If all else fails, they will claim it is your responsibility as an investigator to respond to their demands. Don't fall for that ploy. Only you and the organization you represent can define your responsibilities. A formula for avoiding stress caused by the actions of the debunkers is to follow industry's lead in look- ing for \"value added\" in any interchange or effort. If there is nothing to be gained from responding to them, then don't do it. Apply your energies where they will make a difference. Don't play their game. It takes two to make a game, and if you do not respond to their provocation, then they do not have a game. They lose and you are not stressed. Critics: Criticism is usually stressful, and the world is full of critics. In ufology, a lot of criticism stems from the \"beliefs\" held by the critic. You may be criti- cized because you accept the extraterrestrial hypoth- esis or you do not accept it; because of your stance on abductions; the way you conduct an investigation; whether or not you attend meetings; which organiza- tion you support; your views on the conspiracy theo- ries; and just about everything else you accept or do. It is more difficult if your critic is someone you re- spect in the field, a co-worker, a family member, some- one from your church, an alumni pal, or a business acquaintance. Nevertheless, the game is the same. The critic wants you to believe and act as they do whether or not it makes any sense. Critics pride themselves at being good at pushing your buttons to get you to re- spond. You may find that personal criticism is the most difficult stress maker of all. It strikes at your personal being. It attacks your ego. It affects your self-image in a number of ways. It makes you feel like you did some- thing wrong. It points out that you are not conforming to pre-described norm, and this hurts even if you don't agree with that norm. It may make you angry. And worst of all, it may make you want to give up-to quit. If you are more experienced in dealing with people, you will quickly recognize the critic's style and be able to deal with it. However, ufologists are generally car- ing and honest people. That is why they try to help the victims of UFO events. If you are in this category, you may find it difficult to refute the criticism until you have developed the necessary skills to do it. At that point, the critic may explain that they were just play- ing the part of the devil's advocate. My response to that claim is that \"only the devil needs a devil's advo- cate.\" Be an optimist. Critics are almost always pessimists. If you doubt the wisdom in remaining optimistic, con- sider the study done by researchers at the Mayo Clinic. They found that mind and body are linked, and that attitude has an impact on the final outcome, death. They found that optimistic people live about 19 percent longer than pessimists. Employers/employment: In the dark ages of ufology, some thirty to forty years ago, ufologists were afraid to tell their employers about their interest in the subject for fear of retribution or loss of employment. Fortunately, employers are more enlightened today. The equal opportunity laws and privacy laws thwart their attempts to control employees' private lives. In- dustry leaders are becoming more open to new experi- ences and ideas because of the fast-paced changes in science and technology. Many things that were once seen as impossible are now a reality or are on the hori- zon, soon to become a reality. People have a right to a life outside of work, and most companies today en- courage that to happen. Unfortunately, this is not true for many government workers who must still conform to the old rules of the game. Some ufologists cause a problem with their employ- ers because they expect to be able to spend their work- ing hours steeped in their UFO interests. They expect their employer to be as interested as they are, but this is seldom the case. Employers are generally interested in the success of their businesses, and everything else is secondary. Admittedly, some employers still want to own their employees and control their lives. The good news is that the legal system will eventually get them for it if they don't run themselves out of business due to their archaic ways first. A good way to control stress associated with your employment is to lead a balanced life. Ufology does not need to be all consuming. Employees can have a strong interest in UFOs, do investigations, participate in the work of non-profit corporations, and still be equally involved in their jobs at the same time. The third part of the balance involves maintaining a happy personal life as well. Balance is a good stress reliever.

He is the original civilian investigator of Roswell, and one of the few ufologists who has seriously studied the alleged MJ-12 documents. Friedman has lectured at more than 600 col- leges and more than 100 professional groups in all 50 states, nine Canadian provinces, 11 cities in Australia, 12 cities in the UK, and in 11 other foreign coun- tries. His basic presenta- tion, \"Flying Saucers ARE Real,\" is constantly updated to reflect the lat- est research. He is the author of Crash at Corona: the Definitive Story of the Roswell Incident with aviation-science writer Don Berliner, and TOP SECRET/MAJfC, which Stanton Friedman delves into the controver-  \\ sial MJ-12 documents.  \\ He produced the interactive CD Rom, \"UFOs: the Real Story,\" instigated the Unsolved Mysteries program on Roswell, produced the two-hour \"UFO Controversy\" video, and was heavily involved with the 1979 documen- tary video \"UFOs Are Real\" and the 1996 documentary videos \"Flying Saucers Are Real.\" He has also written more than 75 papers concerning UFOs. With Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in physics from the University of Chicago in 1955 and 1956, he brings an oustanding academic back- ground to the UFO phenomenon. His practical scien- tific background is also impressive, having worked for 14 years as nuclear physicist for General Electric, Gen- eral Motors, Westinghouse, TRW, Aerojet General Nucleonics, and McDonnell Douglas on such projects as nuclear aircraft, fission and fusion rockets, and nuclear powerplants for space. With this sort of background, his conclusions re- garding the UFO phenomenon are significant. He be- lieves that some UFOs are alien spacecraft, that the aliens are not hostile, that some M-J documents are genuine and some are not, that SETI is a waste of time and resources, that the Travis Walton abduction occurred, that the star map drawn by abductee Betty Hill and re- searched by Marjorie Fish is authentic, that a UFO crashed in Brazil and was retrieved with help from the U.S., that there were two crashes in the vicinity of Roswell, NM, in 1947, and that government denial of UFOs constitutes \"a kind of Cosmic Watergate.\" Friedman, a member of the MUFON Board as Di- rector of Special Investigations, also utilizes what he terms his \"gray basket,\" meaning those cases and theo- ries that he is not sure of one way or the other. These would include cattle mutilation, crop circles, the mys- terious death of a Brazilian policeman involved in the Varginha case, the possible connection between reli- gion and UFOs, whether the \"foo fighters\" of WW II were UFOs, alien impregnation of abductees, artifacts on Mars, alien implants, Zecharia Sitchin, and the Ari- zona video. In evaluating the MJ-12 documents, Stan says, \"I believe I have demonstrated that most, if not all, of the new Tim Cooper MJ-12 documents are frauds. How- ever, the finding by the GAO of documents using the strange security marking TOP SECRET Restricted helps to assure that the original MJ documents are genu- ine, despite the vicious baseless attacks that have been made.\" Stan's \"Roswell and MJ-12 in the New Millenium,\" a 27-page report presented at the 2000 MUFON Sym- posium, is available along with 12 other speakers in the MUFON 2000 Symposium Proceedings ($25.00 plus $1.75 postage from MUFON) or as an individual paper from UFORI for $4.00. When asked to evaluate the work of other ufologists, Friedman replied, \"Jim McDonald was certainly my all-time favorite. A real bulldog, and the courage to speak out to loads of technical groups. Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Budd Hopkins, Ted Phillips, David Rudiak, Dr. Richard Haines, John Schuessler, and Aime Michel have all demonstrated a really scientific approach.\" Stan says that Dr. J. Allen Hynek \"made major con- tributions, though was more of an apologist ufologist than any of the others. I am very impressed with the work of John Greenwald, and appreciate the efforts of Roger Leir. Dick Hall has done an awful lot for ufology, and I am looking forward to the new edition of his The UFO Evidence. Dr. David Jacobs, Dr. John Mack, and John Carpenter have all made major con- tributions on the abduction scene. Other good research-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 January 2001 MUFON UFO Journal ers include Chris Rutkowski, Tim Good, Graham Birdsall, and Bob Pratt. This is by no means a complete list, and I do not necessarily agree with all of these researchers all the time.\" Friedman says he is not impressed with Kevin Randle, Derrel Sims, Robert Lazar, Frank Kaufmann, Billy Meier, Guy Kirkwood, Frank Stranges, Michael Wolf Kruvant, Al Bielik, Ray Santilli, or Phil Klass, to name only a few. When asked to list the five or ten \"best cases,\" he replied, \"I'm not best-of-lists oriented. I think a great deal of the Roswell Incident; the Betty and Barney Hill Case; the Travis Walton case; the Delphos, KS, Land- ing Trace Case; the RB-47 visual-radar case; and a whole host of the other cases reported by Dr. James E. McDonald in his 1968 Congressional testimony (71 pages, $10 postpaid from UFORI, PO Box 958, Houlton, ME 04730-0958). Asked what books he would recommend, Friedman replied, \"For data I like Project Blue Book Special Report 14 (available for $25 from Stan); Hall's The UFO Evidence; Hynek's The UFO Experience; The Congressional Hearings of 1968, with McDonald's article especially important; the Condon Report; and Jerome Clark's UFO Encyclopedia. Regarding abduc- tions, I was very impressed with UFOs and Abduc- tions, edited by Dr. David Jacobs, as well as the other books by Hopkins, Jacobs, and Mack. Bruce Maccabee' s UFOs Are Real and Here's the Proof and his The UFO-FBI Connection are good bets. There's a ten-page bibliography in TOP SECRET/MAJIC.\" Friedman is frustrated not only with the government, but also with the mass media. \"The media are, frankly, ignorant of the data, worried about ridicule, and have enormous egos. They seem to think that if flying sau- cers were alien spacecraft and the government has known about it for 53 years, they would have also known it by now. They don't, so they won't put their resources to work on it. \"If they put ten percent of the effort spent on Elian Gonzales and Monica Lewinski, they could blow the lid off the Cosmic Watergate in less than six months. In short, they don't have the courage to do their home- work, and they have blindly accepted the totally false arguments of the nasty, noisy negativists.\" Stan does note that \"some media people are aware that the public is very interested in the subject. Note the TV specials. Not all are bad. A major problem has been produced by the SETI (Silly Effort To Inves- tigate) cultists who take every opportunity to attack ufology while preaching the SETI dogma, though we have the data and they don't.\" Like many ufologists, Friedman got involved in the phenomenon not because of a personal sighting (he has had none), but out of scientific curiosity-and because of a specific book. In this case it was E.J. Ruppelt's original The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, published in 1956. Capt. Ruppelt had been head of Project Blue Book for the Air Force, and wrote his well-balanced book after leaving the service. (He later revised it, reversing his \"pro-UFO\" view.) Friedman, then a 24-year-old nuclear physicist for GE Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion in Cincinnati, says he was intrigued by the original book, \"but not fully con- vinced.\" He continued his reading, and 15 books later came upon Leon Davidson's Blue Book Special Re- port No. 14, \"which had a major impact on me. Tons of data and clear proof that the Air Force was lying.\" Stan soon joined both APRO and NICAP, noting, \"I didn't take Aime Michel's advice not to get in- volved.\" Frank Edwards, who Friedman had gotten to know in Indianapolis when he was working for GM, sent him a copy of his book, Flying Saucers: Serious Business, soon after the book was printed in 1966. Edwards, a radio broadcaster, also put Friedman in contact with KDKA Radio in Pittsburgh in 1967, and it was there that Stan participated in his first radio talk show. This led to an invitation to speak to a book review club which was discussing Edwards' book-his first speaking engagement. Friedman continued to do \"loads of freebies,\" but after a very successful program at Carnegie Mellon University allowed an agent to book him at the Engi- neering Society of Detroit, where he addressed a sell- out crowd of more than 1,000 people. Since then he has booked nearly all of his own programs. Meanwhile he was moving from job to job on spe- cial nuclear projects, working for Westinghouse Astronuclear Lab on fusion rockets and nucleonics, moving to California \"to try to figure out saucer pro- pulsion\" for McDonnell Douglas, then to TRW to work on the Pioneer Spacecraft. \"Since so much of my work dealt with classified advanced nuclear propulsion systems, such as nuclear aircraft for GE, portable nuclear powerplants and fu- sion fockets for Aerojet General Nuclonics, fission nuclear rockets at Westinghouse, and so forth,\" says Friedman, \"I am much better prepared than most to deal with the silly objections, such as you can't get here from there, and that secrets can't be kept. I had a security clearance for 14 years, and have visited 19 archives.\" The series of scientifically exciting projects finally came to an end, however. \"The bottom had fallen out of the advanced nuclear and space system business in 1970,\" Stan recalls, and he decided to be a full-time"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2001 Page 15 ufologist. \"I was tired of moving the family every three years,\" he explains. \"If the McDonnell Dou- glas job had not fallen through, though, I would have been happy to stay there working for Bob Wood. But I do like the freedom of being my own boss and the op- portunity to travel.\" Stan says he doesn't make a great deal of money as a full-time ufologist, but that he had turned a good profit when he sold his home in California in 1980, which enabled him to move to New Brunswick, Canada, and enjoy very low house payments. In looking at the good and the bad of being on the road a great deal, he says, \"I enjoy being on stage and doing the talk shows, meeting people, seeing new places, and visiting archives. But I rarely hear new questions, and I get sick Friedman enjoys talking with people as he sells his books and other materials during his engagements. of the false reasoning and foolish arguments of the nasty, noisy negativists, the fossilized physicists, the ancient aca- demics, and the apologist ufologists. But I must say, I have had only 11 hecklers in more than 700 lectures, and I come on very strong.\" Although becoming a full-time ufologist allowed him to settle his family in one place, the time he spends on the road does take its toll. \"Certainly it has kept me away from home a great deal,\" he notes, \"though when I am home I work at home. I probably didn't spend as much time as I should have with my kids. \"My oldest son was very pleased when I attracted the largest lecture crowd ever to his college. My second son has attended many of my lectures, sold my papers and books, and so forth, so he is definitely interested. My older daughter, who is deaf, was very pleased when I spoke at a college near her which provided an interpreter so that she, with a number of her deaf friends, could 'hear' the lecture. She liked the lecture and the approval of her friends. \"My youngest daughter, who is a journalist now, hasn't heard me speak, but has reported hearing some good things about me from her friends who see me on TV. My first wife was somewhat interested. My current wife is not at all interested, and can manage nicely when I am not home.\" Never one to sit still. Friedman is looking for a pub- lisher for a new book, Flying Saucers and Science, and will be working on a documentary for TV with a primary focus on the government cover-up. Missouri MUFON to host meeting of central states Missouri State Director Bruce Widaman will host a one-day meeting of state directors and assistant state directors from the central part of the country in Kan- sas City, MO, on Saturday, Feb. 10, at the Holiday Inn next to the airport (Hwy 29 & 112th St.). Special mo- tel rates are offered for those staying overnight. The meeting will get underway at 12:30, and an evening session is also planned. The focus of the meet- ing will be the sharing of ideas on how each state can improve operations, as well as on generating ideas to pass on to MUFON Headquarters. \"As MUFON has changed and is still changing,\" says Widaman, \"we at the state level need to take a new look at what we are doing and how we are oper- ating. It's so easy to get in a rut and stay there. We had an interesting experience with the ballot initiative, and we are ready to give that another try, but with more time in which to do it. Not every state would want to do this sort of thing, but there are probably many other activities that would build interest and show results.\" He adds, \"This will be a fun, positive look into the future as we try to put some of the profits from the 2000 MUFON Symposium in St. Louis to good use.

Dolan, Keyhole Publishing Company, 5x8 pa- perback, 544 pages, $27.95. Reviewed by John Schuessler Richard Dolan claims to be a \"history and politics\" sort of a person, and it was from that viewpoint that he researched the UFO problem. In UFOs and the National Secu- rity State, Dolan presents a thor- ough historical analysis of the na- tional security dimensions of the UFO phenomenon and concludes that the military and intelligence community take UFOs very seri- ously, despite their public state- ments about the matter. He makes the case for the UFO problem being a real one because it has involved military personnel around the world for more than fifty years, and is wrapped in secrecy. Dolan says, \"I have tried to weave together three strands of narrative that have important re- lationships to one another: (1) UFO reports themselves, with an emphasis on military encounters; (2) the response to UFOs by na- tional security organizations in the U.S.: and (3) additional activities by American national security groups that, while not directly UFO-related, still provide impor- tant context to the problem, and at times unique insights and connections.\" This volume covers the period 1941 to 1973 and pro- vides a good argument for UFOs being objects, not just misidentified natural phenomena. It covers a period when nearly all military and intelligence operations were cloaked in secrecy, but the cloak had holes in it and important information leaked out. Dolan interprets the \"available facts\" gathered from these leaks to provide a clear and concise roadmap through the maze of UFO history to expose the fact that there was, and is now, a UFO cover- up in place. It is no longer necessary to \"believe\" there is a UFO problem. Dolan clearly scopes the massive nature of Thorough end Mont// Ci. tasru ttaewt, liMtly H An Unclassified History Volume One: nm-1173 RICHARD M. DOLAN the problem and illustrates how each and every intelli- gence group delved into it. It is important to read how Dolan arrived at the conclusion that \"at some point during the mid- 1940s, the intelligence apparatus of the U.S., as well as of several other nations, had reason to believe that there were artifacts in the skies that did not originate from America, Russia, Germany or any other country. Within the U.S., these objects violated some highly sensi- tive military air space, and did not appear to be natural phenomena. One may presume that the affected national security authorities made it an immediate obsession to determine the nature and purpose of these objects, and we may infer that the issue prob- ably became a deep secret by 1946, or 1947 at the latest.\" Dolan answers the question about how power and fear con- tribute to the UFO problem by de- scribing how the bottom 80% of the population must be controlled, pacified, and made compliant. In the \"National Security State\" nearly everything of significance undertaken by America's military and intelligence community in the past half-century has occurred in secrecy. This could be done because the U.S. Defense and Intelligence es- tablishment has had more money at its disposal than most nations. Even though there is supposed to exist an official oversight of these operations, the fact is that over- sight does not occur because of the compartmentalized nature of the security establishment. He shoots holes in the claims that se- crets really cannot be kept and shows how \"they\" really can cover this up. Because there are some flaws in the system, we do learn something about what is going on, while expos- ing the whole truth of the situation is avoided. How- ever, deception is a key element of warfare, and when winning is all that matters, the conventional morality held by ordinary people becomes an impediment. Examples of public deception by national security el- ements are provided in many of the chapters. This book gives some common sense answers to questions such as: Is interstellar travel still impossible? Do we need breakthroughs in propulsion for \"them to get here from there?\" Why would presumably supe- rior aliens be interested in us?

Andrus, Jr. & Ruben J. Uriarte Veteran ufologist and MUFON activist Paul C. Cerny died Nov. 27,2000, in San Jose, CA, from a massive stroke. He is survived by his wife Genevieve \"Gen\" Cemy. Paul was born in 1920 in Cedar Rapids, IA, leaving the \"tall corn state\" for California in the mid-fifties to con- tinue his occupation as an electronics engineer and minia- turization specialist. From 1961 to 1972, when NICAP was the flourishing leader in ufology, he was the chairman of the very active Bay Area Sub-committee. He had a long-time inter- est in astronomy which in- spired him to research space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial intelli- gence. Before getting deeply in- volved in the UFO field, Paul received his ama- teur radio license, K6SOG, p aul Cerny and earned a private pilot li- cense. After no longer be- ing active as a ham operator, he utilized his CB radio dur- ing extensive field investigations throughout northern Cali- fornia. His many projects included experiments in \"Operation Lure,\" as related by Major Donald E. Keyhoe in his book Aliens From Space (1973).

Dolan's research provides facts to substantiate the claims that the UFO phenomenon has always been glo- bal; that UFOs are actual objects; that the actual num- ber of UFO sightings exceeds any official total; and that official government investigators found that some people were actually seeing alien beings. He concludes that the UFO cover-up is one secret among many within the American system. Like other areas within its domain, the UFO problem has been handled secretly, with great deception, and significant resources. MUFON and were assigned leadership roles consistent with their past accomplishments. He was appointed State Director for Northern California on Feb. 6,1973, sharing this honor with Mrs. Idabel E. Epperson, who assumed the position of State Director for Southern California. Paul served in this position for more than 14 years. He also worked with Dr. J. Allen Hynek as a field investigator for CUFOS. Paul was elected to the MUFON Board of Directors in 1975 as the Western Regional Director, and was appointed to the staff of The MUFON UFO Journal in 1977 to handle promotion and publicity. He produced his own illustrated UFO brochures for distribution in re- sponse to inquiries received from his numerous appear- ances on radio and television stations throughout the west- ern states. His superb public relations and effective leadership resulted in not only a well-organized State Section net- work in northern California, but the largest concentration of MUFON field investigators for any section of the coun- try. He had traveled close to a million miles by auto, a good share of this on UFO investigations and field research. He had probably done more field investigations of the phenomena in Northern Califomia-and possibly the west- ern states as well-than any other individual. Paul served on the Executive Committee and hosted the 1979 Tenth Annual MUFON UFO Symposium in San Francisco (Burlingame, CA), surpassing all previous sym- posiums with respect to the number of attendees, speak- ers, special features, and displays. He utilized another of his special talents by con- structing the mechanized/lighted flying saucer that is a featured attraction in the MUFON UFO Museum, formerly in Texas and now in Colorado. In a newspaper article dated April 8, 1978, Paul in- dicated that he had seen four unidentified flying ob- jects, the last one in February, 1976. But considering the possibilities, the sightings were only a taste of a tempting pie. He stated, \"I have been throwing myself at them for four years now. I would love to be taken on board, but they keep kicking me back as a reject.\" Paul was a tremendous asset to MUFON, and a great guy to all of his colleagues. He will be sincerely missed by all of us.

As I write these words, my report titled The UFO Evi- dence, Volume II (UFOE-II) is scheduled for slightly de- layed publication in January 2001 by Scarecrow Press. This work has had birth pangs spanning several years now, nearly aborted when Barnes & Noble (who had published a reprint edition of the original 1964 volume in 199?) decided-after signing a publication contract with the UFO Research Coalition-that they couldn't deal with its size and complexity, so they can- celled the project. Research and writing of the new vol- ume originally was sponsored by Robert T. Bigelow under a contract with the UFO Research Coalition. When Barnes & Noble bowed out as publisher, the Coalition sent a publication proposal around to a few dozen publishers and received a positive response from Scarecrow Press. The rest is (I hope, by the time you read these words) history. The publication delays have caused the content to be slightly outdated, but not seriously so, since very little has changed in the past few years. The word \"perspective\" applies exceedingly well to UFOE-II, since that is exactly what it provides. Per- spective on the long-term, highly persistent patterns of UFO sightings over the past 50+ years. Younger generations who did not experience the sighting waves and \"classic\" sightings of the 1950s through 1980s tend not to appreciate why the ET hy- pothesis is the most likely answer to the phenomenon, broadly speaking, the only viable alternative explana- tion being what I termed long ago the \"Deluded Ob- server Hypothesis\" (DOH, or maybe it should be \"DUH\"). The DOH essentially says that witnesses, regardless of intelligence, expertise, or experience, ALWAYS are being fooled by prosaic phenomena and didn't really see what they thought they did. Well, having now reached the age of 70 and having spent close to 50 years of my life seriously investigating UFO reports, I am very pleased to be in the position of laying this report on the figurative table and challenging the skeptics to explain why allegedly random misperceptions display such strong phenomenological patterns in all respects. The report covers the 30 years since 1964 in great detail, with some last minute updates after that, and frankly (in my opinion) totally demolishes the \"psy- chosocial\" theorists' position. By \"all respects\" I mean that witnesses from all walks of life (from highly trained professionals to av- erage citizens) have, with remarkable consistency, reported exactly the same details of physical appear- ance (shapes, structures, appendages); associated ef- fects (various forms of physical trace evidence); and performance features over a span of more than 50 years. A far more extraordinary phenomenon to me than accepting the overwhelming witness testimony as ba- sically valid is the casual rejection of their testimony by the \"data deniers\" who really seem to think that a hodgepodge of misperceptions can account for every- thing. Never mind whether you think UFOs carry alien visitors to Earth, the reasoning of the \"psychosocials\" and their allies falls far short of explaining the reported data. That data, as UFOE-II strongly establishes, is highly consistent and not easily explainable in any conventional terms. Since emotional commitment to one or the other opposing belief systems will never get us anywhere, I propose in UFOE-II that we treat UFOs as a natural phenomenon whose well-documented effects on hu- manity justify scientific study at least to the same de- gree as natural disasters. Furthermore, I suggest spe- cific procedures for studying the reports. The UFO Evidence, Volume II is a challenge to the major institutions of society to wake up to some seri- ous facts that need to be thoroughly studied. Detailed case reports and tables of recurring features are pre- sented. The original 1964 volume was helped along by a timely revival of credible sightings after many years of quietude, and as a result received international publicity. We may not be as fortunate this time as far as exte- rior events are concerned, but those who glibly de- bunk UFO sightings at least will have to deal with the evidence presented here.

Barry still requires assistance in finding new articles not contained in this listing, especially from foreign and non-English lan- guage journals. Another new item recently added to the Sign His- torical Group Resources page, \"Barry Greenwood's UFO Clipping Volumes Listing,\" helps to demonstrate the enormous amount of press coverage the UFO sub- ject has received over the past 50 years. http://www.projectl947.com/shg/ufoclips.htm Greenwood's collection comes from decades of per- sonal searches in literally thousands of different news- papers, and from large newspaper clipping collections such as those contained in the Center for UFO Stud- ies' files, the collection efforts of others such as Loren Gross, Robert Gribble, Ted Bloecher, June Larson, Gene Duplantier, newspaper columnist Buckley Grif- fin, the New England UFO Study Group, and the Me- teor Research Society. New clippings and accumulations of material in various libraries, archives and newspaper morgues around the country continue to be added from the con- tributions of scores of other researchers and correspon- dents. Large portions of the Project 1947 collection effort are also present in these files. Finally, an ongoing inventory of File Folder Head- ings of Government Documents in the Holdings of Jan A Idndi http://www.projectl947.com/shg/janfold.htm shares the Sign Historical Group website with a simi- lar compilation by Barry Greenwood http:// www.projectl947.com/shg/govintro.htm Both inventories represent decades of work by many researchers. While there are overlaps in the material in the two collections, they are mostly complemen- tary, containing much material which is not duplicated in the other. Again, the huge amount of material shows the extent of government interest and research into the subject during the last 50 years. The Sign Historical Group (SHG) is dedicated to collecting important UFO material, preserving UFO history, and indexing and categorizing UFO documents and research materials. Most members of the Sign His- torical Group have their own research projects which take up most of their time and resources. The Sign Historical Group was formed with the aim that some type of concerted action should be taken to improve the understanding of UFO history. SHG has approved a number of modest projects not requiring a great amount of time or money. First and foremost is an oral history program which has inter- viewed a number of important personalities in UFO history: Frederick Durant, Col. Robert Friend, Profes- sor Charles Moore, J.J. Kaliszewski, Al Chop, Capt. Willis Sperry, Dr. Leon Davidson, Col Doyle Rees, Dr. Frank Salisbury, William Rhodes, and dozens of others. SHG attempts to acquire important UFO material and personal papers which are in danger of being lost. A number of small personal collections have been ac- quired, as have several larger holdings representing decades of UFO research. SHG encourages members and non-members to produce inventories of their UFO material, to give an indication of what exactly is avail- able in various collections. SHG members conduct research at various archives and libraries, and utilize Freedom of Information re- quests and contacts with specialists and historians to locate new material. Utilization of the USAF Intelli- gence Report Index Cards has resulted in a number of FO1A requests for various intelligence reports concern- ing UFOs or related material. SHG looks forward to further important develop- ments which will increase our knowledge of UFO his- tory and aid in the preservation of important documents and material concerning this intriguing and far reach- ing subject. Looking for answers to mysteries teaches us a great deal about ourselves as well. Due to upgrades on the server, some documents got left out during the last update of the Project 1947 website.

I will try to use this column lo bring you a flavor of UFO activity in my native Britain. You will find some things that are familar but others that seem very different over here. To start with I want to update an issue that some- what defines British UFOlogy-since the UK was the place from whence the crop circle mystery was ex- ported to the rest of the world, although, ironically, it did not start here. There were, in fact, multiple crop circle events in Canada and Australia well before the British UFO community discovered these strange cir- cular patterns in cereal fields during the summer of 1980. This past year has been the most active in this field since 1991, so it is appropriate to offer a status report. The circles were first found in fields of Wiltshire oats about 100 miles southwest of London. These initial marks were rough swathes, and whilst they had the look of a giant cookie cutter from the sky stamping out an oval in the Meld they were not sufficiently well defined to suyyc-si any kind of intelligence at work. Indeed these ejrly circles were nnc^ngatedby just a few UFOIogisUt (led by Ian Mrzyglod, now part of the UFOIN team) and one physicist, Dr. Terence Meaden (editor of the. Journal of Meteorology). Their mutual opinion that they were created by a hot weather whirlwind was perfectly reasonable given the form of these 1980 circles. But the problems grew as more and more circles appeared and exploded in complexity almost weekly. By 1983, when the tabloid press discovered them in a big way, the numbers had risen, and no longer were they rough ovals but multiple formations. The com- plexity continued to escalate until we had animal glyphs, gigantic formations in mathematical patterns, complete with straight lines and undeniable evidence of order and intelligence behind them. The battle lines were drawn. On the one hand were the original investigators, sure that basic circles were weather induced, but suspicious of the complex ones (the first hoax-a moderately complex pattern-was ex- posed in July 1983 when one national paper paid a farmer to try to fool the rest of the media, and many others soon followed.) But a growing number of UFOlogists and new age mystics (already strong in the area because of the con- nections with ancient sites like Stonehenge and Avebury) saw the gradual increase in complexity as a warning of ecological catastrophe-surely coming from another intelligence. Then, overnight, the media interest was killed off suddenly in 1991 when two elderly artists claimed that they had fooled the world by producing ever evolving patterns using boards and rope. Their yarn convinced the press. But the circles and the researchers refused to go away. In fact, these two chaps, Doug and Dave, had not claimed to create more than a small percentage of all circles. And, much more importantly, said they based the idea on apparently real circles that formed in snake infested reed beds in Northern Queensland, Australia, during 1966. Thus there always was a crop circle mystery even before the hoaxers began their games. The media have simply missed the significance of that vital clue. Against this background, the past year has proved fas- cinating, not merely because the media rediscovered circles with a vengeance, but because several key events took place amidst the numerous pretty patterns that dotted the crop fields as always and have fast become a major tourist attraction (another clue not to be over- looked!). Although hoaxers had been caught in the act be- fore, one man who was arrested faking a circle was successfully prosecuted. He also turned out to be a well known ufologist. One of his motives was to test out the research community, but, of course, he was un- lucky because most tricksters escape the courts to the chagrin of affected farmers. But, again, incidentally, most of the damage is not done by the actual hoaxer (flattened crop is still harvestable), but by the hordes of sightseers that their handiwork attracts. Yet for me the real intrigue during the 2000 season was the curious reversal of positions between the \"be- lievers\" and the \"skeptics.\" Colin Andrews, who had long argued for the strange- ness of the phenomenon, announced a theory that re- vol\\ e^ around a natural magnetic/electrical energy field ti i^cnng the non-hoaxed circles. Meantime, the once cynical media are now champi- oning tar more remarkable solutions. The well known crime writer Colin Wilson had a major article in a re- sponsible newspaper (the Daily Mail) explaining why he believes aliens are creating these marks as a mes- sage to us all. Wilson's argument was based on an incomplete knowledge of the mystery. For instance, he charged that if circles were natural in origin they would have always occurred. Yet, indeed, the biggest argument in favour of the natural origin of some circles is that they have, in fact, always occurred! Whilst the media may have been AWOL for some"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 2001 Page 21 Jenny Randies takes a break in Shropshire, England, following a lecture to RAF officers. years, crop circle research has not been idle during that time. It has established conclusively that outside the pretty widespread hoaxing that clearly is rife, a smaller scale, but real, if usually more simplistic, phenomenon does genuinely exist. This is the phenomenon that has provoked some circles virtually everywhere (and not just in crop fields because circles have been found in grass, sand, snow and other media, but these rarely last long enough to be noticed). There is even a circle on a wet road surface tied to one of Britain's best known abduction cases (that of police officer Alan Godfrey in Todmorden, West York- shire, in November 1980). Furthermore a large body of eyewitnesses have actually seen them during for- mation-usually observing an invisible energy laying flat the field (in one case described as like a fan open- ing up). And numerous sources, from pioneering aviation surveys of the landscape during the first half of the 20th century to Victorian age science journals (such as Nature), and even back to old woodcuts and folk tales, all seem to establish the pattern that there have been circles reported for at least hundreds of years. But, importantly, almost without exception these ob- served and historical circles have been of the simpler variety, not animal glyphs or mathematically precise patterns as so common today. So, as we enter the third decade of crop circle re- search it is interesting that whilst the pioneer working researchers have come to establish what is, and is not, true, and have moderated their stance to a more ratio- nal-if still fascinating-one, the move to revive the alien force behind crop circles is coming from a media long About the author We are pleased to welcome Jenny Randies to the staff of the MUFON UFO Journal as a regular col- umnist. One of Britain's most prominent ufologists, she is the author of more than 40 books, beginning with UFOs: A British Viewpoint in 1979. She was ac- tive with the British UFO Research Organization (BUFORA) for 20 years, serving as director of in- vestigations from 1981 until 1993. Jenny wrote and presented a six-part in-depth documentary series for BBC radio entitled \"UFO Call,\" which set a record audience for that arm of the BBC, gaining more than 4 million listeners. She has edited the Northern UFO News since 1974, and is the British consultant to the J. Allen Hynek Cen- ter for UFO Studies (CUFOS) journal, the Interna- tional UFO Reporter. starved of the big story. Of course, there will be readers of the Journal who support the view that an alien intelligence is creating some of the circles. And, to be fair, there are many other aspects to this debate that I do not have space to go into here. Without doubt an argument exists that some intelligence has used a long occurring natural phenomenon as the template on top of which to con- vey a message. Indeed that seems to be precisely what has happened with the crop circle mystery-the only dispute being whether that message conveying intelligence is an alien one seeking to warn us of the fate of the planet or hu- man (and thus the message being conveyed is \"fooled you!\") My personal view is that circles are nine part hoax (basically the complex patterns) and one part some kind of atmospheric eiicrp) lorce (essentially the more simple patterns). But I am prepared to be convinced otherwise, as no doubt further evidence will continue to appear. In UFOlogy it is never wise to say that all questions are conclusively answered. That tempts the fates! But in British UFOlogy, as you will find during coming issues, caution and objectivity are words ihai we use often. Just try not to translate them wrongly as disbe- lief and skepticism, because usually thev arc not that- as I hope you will come to see through my future re- ports.

Cooperation in UFO Investigations During my presentation at the MUFON 2000 In- ternational UFO Symposium in St. Louis, MO, I urged greater unity and cooperation in the UFO field. While most groups have their own rules, goals, and ideas, we all have the common goal of resolving the UFO mystery, and we have a much stronger voice when we work together in some way. I am pleased to note that I have been hearing of a number of cooperative ventures since the July event, and in each case it was a win-win situation for the groups and for UFO research. One of the more recent examples was reported in the October 2000 issue of the MUFON UFO Jour- nal on page 11. State Section Director George Pindroh said that the investigation of the July 22, 2000, Ohio UFO incident was successful because it was a cooperative venture involving himself. Rick Dell'Aquila, and Cleveland Ufology Project (CUP) investigator Captain Chuck. The Cleveland Ufology Project is said to be the oldest investigative club with regularly scheduled meetings in the world. My thanks to Captain Chuck and CUP for working with MUFON investigators to make this a success- ful investigation. Cooperation is another reason for the success of the annual MUFON UFO Symposium. Presenters are selected on the basis of their contributions in the field, with the most important factor being the con- tent and quality of their work. You will note that each year some of the presenters represent organiza- tions other than MUFON, and we are proud to be working with each of them. UFO Information - Special Offer A frequently asked question is \"where can I get reliable, well-investigated UFO information?\" There are a number of sources, including MUFON, the Center for UFO Studies, Fund for UFO Research, and a number of other organizations. However, if you want to know what has gone on in this field you should look at the historical treasure trove of UFO data that may be found in annual MUFON UFO Sym- posium Proceedings documents. MUFON has copies of the Proceedings available for sale dating back to 1976. It is important for researchers to understand the depth of the work that has already been done, as well as how it was done. For that rea- son, the Proceedings are never out of date and are valu- able additions to any library. Further, few of these im- portant papers can be found anywhere else today. To introduce new members to this valuable source of information, we are offering a special price on the Pro- ceedings of the MUFON 1988 International UFO Sym- posium in Lincoln, NE.

National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena (NARCAP) formation announced Dr. Richard Haines has announced the formation of the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anoma- lous Phenomena (NARCAP), a research organization which will study the impact of anomalous aerial phe- nomena on aviation safety. NARCAP is a non-profit, scientific organization that will provide pilots and air traffic controllers with spe- cial reporting facilities to improve US aviation safety. Ted Roe, NARCAP's executive director, explains: \"Our center was developed to help enhance aviation safety by better understanding the nature and potential effects of unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) upon ground and airborne systems, piloting, and cockpit/ aircrew procedures.\" Roe says the center takes no position on the source or nature of such phenomena and prefers to let the data speak for themselves."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 January 2001 MUFON UFO Journal By John Schuessler International Director MUFON 2001 Annual UFO Symposium The MUFON 2001 Annual UFO Symposium will be held at the beautiful Hyatt Regency Irvine Hotel in Orange County, California, on July 20-22. Sym- posium Chairman Jan Harzan has announced the theme of the event as \"2001-Joining the Cosmic Neighborhood.\" MUFON has reserved a block of rooms for sym- posium attendees at $89 per night from Thursday July 19 through Tuesday July 24. Since Orange County is conveniently located for a variety of va- cation opportunities such as Newport Beach, Disney Land, the Queen Mary and much more, symposium attendees are encouraged to extend their stay and vacation in sunny California while paying only the MUFON room rate. The usual rate for these same rooms is $205 per night. Hotel reservations may be made by calling the Hotel's Reservations Depart- ment at (949) 975-1234 or by mail to the attention of the Reservation's Manager, 17900 Jamboree Road, Irvine, CA 92614. The hotel is conveniently located near Orange County's John Wayne Airport. The symposium committee has established admis- sion rates for attendees at one-half to one-fourth the cost of most UFO conferences. In addition, there is a significant break for early registration. The ad- mission price for the whole conference is $89 per person prior to April 29, 2001, and $99 per person prior to July 1, 2001. Admission at the door will be $109 for all events. Instructions for registering for the symposium will be given in the February 2001 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. The speaker's list is shaping up nicely with more than a dozen outstanding presentations to be given during the weekend event. Field Investigator Trainees MUFON is fortunate to have an ever-growing number of Field Investigator Trainees. Our goal for train- ees is for them to move through the training process as rapidly as possible and become certified as MUFON Field Investigators. Many State Directors offer training classes to assist in the process and team trainees with seasoned investigators to work on current UFO cases. The main tool for trainees is the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. The manual is organized for easy self-study and is a useful document to have on hand for a variety of investigations. The Field Investigator's Manual may be ordered for $25 + $3.50 P&H from MUFON, P.O. Box 369, Morrison, CO 80465-0369. The final step in the process is for the trainee to re- quest a Field Investigator's Exam from MUFON Head- quarters. The exam is an open-book self-administered test and may be ordered whenever the Field Investiga- tor Trainee has completed the prescribed field of study and is ready to be tested. New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director of Field Investigator Training, has announced that two more Field Inves- tigator Trainees have successfully completed the Field Investigators Exam and are now certified MUFON Field Investigators. They are Miller Johnson, Albuquerque, NM, and Barbra Maher, Littleton, CO. New State Section Director Utah Co-state Directors Ron Regehr and Elaine Douglass have announced the assignment of Eleanor Sanini as State Section Director for Washington, Iron, Kane, and Garfield counties in Utah. Vacant Board Positions Membership Director Gerald E. Rolwes has va- cated the post of Membership Director because his photography business is placing a lot of demands on his time. Although Jerry held the post for only a short time, we will miss his excellent administrative skills. Jerry remains as State Director for the state of Washington. Director of Investigations Dan Wright has been forced to vacate the position of Director of Investi- gations for personal reasons. Dan has been a power- house of activity on behalf of MUFON. He led the effort to revise the MUFON bylaws, and spent months working with the transition team to arrive at a set of bylaws that could be sent to the membership for ratification. Dan worked closely with Don Weatherby, Wendy Ban, Bill Konkolesky and Tom Deuley to bring the new MUFON web site and database into reality and make it a success. He screened all incoming UFO reports and worked with state directors and field investigators to coordinate in- vestigations and UFO reporting. He was active as a (Continued on Page 23)"}]
