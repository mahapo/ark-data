FROM THE EDITOR The spiraling \"UFO\" that dazzled the New England seaboard this summer was rapidly identified as an experimental Japanese satellite by both skeptics and ufologists. Articles from both sides of the fence are presented to show how the sources and techniques of each led to a quick solution of what otherwise might have been a source of some controversy. We thank Walter Webb and Stan Gordon, too, who also responded promptly with articles on the same series of sightings. Unfortunately, only so much space can be devoted to the subject- Inside, we look at a number of other recent American UFO reports which were not so readily solved, including updates on Petaluma and Cash-Landrum. Next issue we'll have two more articles that review Brazilian UFOs authored by New York-based journalist Antonio Huneeus and veteran researcher Irene Granchi. Meanwhile, apologies to our readers for the lateness of this issue, due to circumstances beyond our control. Some contributors will also be disappointed to learn their articles have been delayed until next month. To offset some of the imbalance we have included the Night Sky for both October and November.

By Walt Andrus     , Walt Andrus, MUFON's interna- tional director, lives in Seguin, Texas. \"; .'.,., '•  . • Robert Gribble at the National UFO Reporting Center (1-206-722- 3000) in Seattle, Washington received 100 telephone calls during the evening of August 12,1986 from throughout the eastern U.S.A., reporting an unusual lighted object moving from southwest to northeast. An F.A.A. .Air Traffic Controller in Syracuse, New York: stated to the press that he thought it was an unidentified flying object. Observed through binoculars, other • witnesses in Portland, Maine . and' Syracuse, New York told Bob Gribble that the object was a white light heading northeast as if propelled by a rocket in a \"cork screw\" fashion. The press wire services; distributed the report throughout the nation, creating considerable excitement. When Bob summarized his reports, he found that the object was observed from 9:50 pm to 10:10 pm EDSTi Witnesses in the southern states reported the direction as southeast, whereas those in the northern states observed it in the east and northeast sky. Due to the location of the Goddard Space Flight Center's Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia's eastern shore where rocketborne scientific experiments are conducted, this became the first target in the investigation. Bob Gribble immediately contacted this facility and found that due to inclement weather they had not launched the rockets that were scheduled that,evening. Walt Andrus called Joyce B. Milliner in the Office of Public Affairs, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, VA 23337, who confirmed that there were no rocket launches on the evening of August 12th from that location. The two launches scheduled for August 12 were also \"scrubbed\" for'August 13th. Walter H. Andrus, Jr. Since Joyce B. Milliner has regularly supplied MUFON with news releases prior to planned rocketborne scientific experiments, she was very cooperative .during this telephone conversation in resolving what had been observed. Mr. Virgil Gardner at the Laser Network Operations, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland identified the object to Miss Milliner, since he was involved in laser experiments in conjunction with the object. Mr. Gardner said it was a Japanese Experimental Geodetic Satellite launched from Japan on August 12th (Japanese date and time) that was placed in a 932-mile high orbit and scheduled to pass over the east coast of the U.S.A. at approximately 10 pm EDST. The,. 6-foot diameter, globe- shaped satellite is covered with 318 individual mirrors on its surface and was rotating at 40 r.p.m. Due to its height, the sun was reflecting from the mirrors providing .the illumination and the corkscrew cloud . noted by most •witnesses. Obviously the light reflected from the satellite mirrors was eliminated when it ' passed into the shadow of the Earth on its northeastward trajectory. ! LASER TRACK The screw-shaped cloud observed was the \"dumping\" .of unused liquid 1 , hydrogen , fuel from the launching rocket booster.-Mr. Gardner and the people at the Laser Network Operations were tracking the satellite from Greenbelt, Maryland with lasers as part of a . global cooperative experiment. Even 'though the object must now be classified. as an IFO after the investigation, 100 long .distance telephone calls from the Mississippi River to the east coast is' strong assurance that Bob Cribble's National UFO.Reporting Center is an effective tool in obtaining UFO sighting reports nationwide. (Even one of the astronauts flying a T-38 near Houston, Texas observed the object per John Schuessler.) 100 pre-paid telephone calls is gratifying evidence that the general public still has an interest in space and UFQs. Walt Andrus gave Miss Milliner the address of the Center for UFO Studies and asked. that CUFO$ also be placed on the news release mailing list from Wallops .Island. We appreciate the many newspaper clippings and personal sighting reports submitted to MUFQN on this sighting. Dana M. Schmidt, State Section Director in New York, interviewed several witnesses in the Rochester area. Richard D- Seifried, State Director for Ohio in Dayton received numerous inquiries.

While observing Mars in the \"handle\" of the teapot Sagittarius, Eugene's attention was caught by a first magnitude object just to the north and west of Mars (about 2 degrees NW). It was approximately 16 degrees above the south horizon and 3 degrees to the east of due south. It had the appearance of a small comet with a short tail pointing directly west. Through his 7 x 50 binoculars he saw a point source of light with a jet of vapor emanating from it into a spiral shape. He thought the point source of light was rotating counter- clockwise at a slow rate of speed. The angular size grew to 3/4 degree within the first 30 seconds. The \"gas\" was a very bright yellowish color when viewed through binoculars as it was being expelled from the star-like object and its intensity fell off with distance becoming a blue-grey color. After making two telephone calls to alert other observers and two minutes into the observation, he noted that the object had stopped spewing the gas. When the object was due east, the cloud was now elongated and was perpendicular to the eastern horizon. The star-like object was still preceding the cloud by approximately 1/8 degree and centered with the vertical About the photo Amateur photographer Lor- raine Whitaker of Lanesboro, in Susquehanna County, Pa., took this photo Tuesday night while out taking pictures of the moon. Whitaker, taking some night shots from the deck of her Via- duct Street house, said she was waiting for the moon to clear some trees when she saw a bright, white spiral cloud along with what seemed to be a star pulling the cloud. She said it was moving so fast she was surprised she was able to get it on film. \"I was in the right place at the right time,\" she said. Whitaker photographed the object using a 35mm camera with an 80 to 200 zoom lens. Her camera was mounted on a tripod, and she made the several-second exposure on 400 ASA Kodacolor film. Whitaker said photography is a hobby for her, and that she had just completed a summer course in color photography at Broome Community College. elongation. After 4 minutes of viewing the light source faded out in the northeast sky, heading north northeast toward the constellations Cassiopeia and Perseus. Mr. Witkowski alerted F.W.

It drifted horizontally toward the northeast. Ernest H. Wells, former State Section Director in Huntsville, Alabama and his son Ronald reported the following; the illuminated cloud was about 1/4 or l/5th the diameter of the moon and was located about 20 degrees east of the planet Mars when first observed. It became larger and more diffused as it drifted north. There was a smoky veil around the light becoming rod-like as it drifted out of view to the northeast. Walt Andrus was interviewed by Tom Bauerle at radio station WGR in Buffalo, New York who said his station was swamped with calls about the illuminated cloud just after 10 pm. In addition to the Geodetic Satellite launched by the Japanese H-l rocket it also carried a satellite for use by amateur radio stations. The key to the rocket is its new 10.5 ton thrust LE5 engine in its second stage. The engine burns super cold liquid hydrogen with liquid oxygen — the most potent rocket combination in, use, and the same propellants used by America's space shuttle main engines."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"UFO FOR A DAY By James E. Oberg James Oberg is a well-known Houston-based space scientist and aeronautics writer. At about 10 PM EOT on Tuesday, August 12, 1986 (0200 UT Aug 13), nearly the entire eastern half of-the United States was treated to a spectacular celestial apparition. Millions of people were outside looking for Perseid meteors, and many of them had their astronomical instruments and cameras at the ready. So when a bright .cloud-like UFO (for it was a genuine Unidentified-Flying Object, at least for a day) appeared in the eastern sky, moving from right to left, it had probably the largest audience of any UFO ever witnessed in North America. Sightings occurred from Georgia (Florida''was socked in with clouds) to Louisiana to, Houston, Texas, to Tulsa and Oklahoma City, to Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ontario and Quebec, and all points in between: South Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts — the whole eastern seaboard. Descriptions of the object, and its motion varied, but .a general picture soon emerged; It was called a pinpoint, a moving spiral, a glowing cloud, and a big ball of-fire. In Houston, Don Stockbauer described an orangish • nebulosity surrounded by an irregularly shaped white/ cloud elongated vertically, with a dim' starlike nucleus. Brenda Newton of Rochester, New York, recalled: \"It started to get bigger and it had a tail. By the time we got out of the truck, it had begun to spiral. It lasted for a few minutes, then became like a dim star and floated toward the west.\" The vice president of the Syracusan Astronomical Society (New York) said it resembled a \"reflection of the m'oon off a cloud, but it was very iridescent, very vivid.\" Wayne Madea, an amateur astronomer' in northern Maine, saw a bright star-like object emit a luminous, rapidly expanding donut- shaped cloud; through a- telescope James Madea saw \"a pinpoint of light, like a satellite, traveling with the cloud\". As it turned out, amateur radio listeners — \"hams\" — were also receiving radio signals from space at that very moment. And that was the key which led • many independent observers ; to solve the apparition quickly and accurately. Others (such as myself) did it the hard* way, with application : of basic principles of spaceflight and orbital.motion. My involvement began at noon Aug. 13 when, at a luncheon \"brown bag\" meeting of astronomy enthusiasts, a report of a bright light in the eastern sky, seen from Houston, was discussed. Returning from lunch, I received a phone call from David L. Chandler, a writer for the Boston Globe with whom I had discussed other spaceflight stories months before. He filled me in on the sightings, and I suggested he check about space Oberg •Richard Prwtt/Dallas Morning News launchings, particularly the Japanese launch (which I had also learned of that morning). At first there was difficulty in ascertaining the exact launch time (International Date Line, and'confusion at the Japanese representative's office over EST vs EDT), but an hour later, armed with a good liftoff time and with known orbital inclination and period, I was able to produce a hand-calculated map which showed the objct heading up the east coast at about 10PM EDT. Its altitude was about 1500 km (almost a thousand miles), well high enough for it still to have been sunlit even though the ground below had been dark for more than an hour.

Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (which got me on a Buffalo, New York radio show which had aired LIVE accounts of the UFO on Tuesday evening), to NASA Public Information at the, Kennedy Space. Center in Florida, and to the MUFON research group in Texas. This in turn resulted in my receiving about twenty additional telephone calls from news media throughout the east. . Chandler's story appeared in the Boston Gfobe (page 6) .on Thursday, August 14. It moved over some national news wire ; too, since it also appeared in the same day's Houston Chronicle, some Tacoma, Washington, paper, and presumably elsewhere. On Friday, I did an interview with an Associated Press reporter from Louisville, Ky, and that story moved nationally over the weekend. LESSONS . . Within a week, ;,the \"UFO\" was? , stuffed, boxed, arid buried.(it should also have been seen from Central America, the Caribbean, and the north coast of South America-. — those reports may dribble in over the next few .months). But it was a marvelous experience for the witnesses arid for the .analysts, and several interesting points can be raised,• about - \"UFO reports\" based pri this fortuitous experiment.. Several interesting events involved coincidences. .Caught . iip in the excitement, Air Traffic Controller Tim Jones in .Syracuse reported three different-colored lights ^randomly . moving and hovering for 45 minutes ' '(but it turned but he. was watching B- . ••'- 52sJandrat nearby'Rome AFB 1 ,-'several hours after, the real UFO); his account .was carried in , the nationwide news media, but the solution rarely was. ' In- Clark County, • Kentucky, residents were panicked by an explosion while the light show was .going on — but the sheriff later got an anonymous phone call, confessing to setting off illegal'• fireworks. Recalled County .Deputy. Larry Lawson/ \"The people said their.,.homes shook >and. windows vibrated aJnf there had been .- an explosion or earthquake... They said the whole sky lit up. All these people, weren't imagining or seeing things. Some of them were very terrified over it right after it happened.\" These illustrate the power of coincidence, in which two concurrent independent events can easily (and erroneously) be integrated into a single unsolvable mystery. Also, the emotional'state of witnesses (such as fear) is no . measure of the authenticity of their original perception. \"SOLUTIONS\" One other amusing aspect was the wide variety of half-baked explanations offered for the \"UFO\".-Some speculation associated it.. with the meteor shower, a barium cloud, or a satellite burn-up, while other guesses associated it .with an explosion of. the Japanese satellite. Professor Richard Stoner of Bowling Green State University in Ohio was quoted as saying: \"It is. caused.by little bits and pieces of dust from the comet. They're • very small, if there were a larger piece, an icy piece of. material, something about the size of a snowflake, it might well cause something like this. It would vaporize and leave a glowing cloud behind it.\" Astronomy . professor Martha Haynes of. Cornell didn't trust the observers: \"When people who watch the stars once, maybe twice a year go out and look hard for a while, they're bound to see\\things they, think are strange.... When you're in .that mind set anything like : the light of a plane,on the horizon looks'strange.\". John, Bosworth of NASA's Goddard Space Center scored a near miss when he attributed the reports to glints off the EGP satellite's mirrors, reflecting moonlight: \"I suspect that's what they saw\", he told a reporter. The National Weather Service and the Seattle-based National UFO Reporting Center agreed \"it was some sort of .natural phenomenon.\"  • • ,. . • A number of people, however, got it right,.and right from the start. Tom Boltori .'of the David Dunlap Observatory north of Toronto told newsmen it was 'Caused by release of something from.,..a satellite: \"The satellite. was actually seen in the telescope here and we had a report from an amateur astronomer (who) saw it and saw the release of material from it •— but we're not sure which satellite it. was and we're not sure what the material .was that was released.\" A number of amateur radio people also told their local.papers exactly the true story: for example, Richard C. Eaton of Fayetteville, NY, a retired GE engineer, was quoted in the Syracuse Herald Journal as suspecting the cloud was part of the Japanese launch. The spiral form also was intriguing. In .Syracuse, amateur astronomer Denise Sabatini reported: \"It started out as.a pinpoint of light. It was as if it were releasing some type of reflective gas, into the air, and as the gas was released into air, it was as if it was spiraling around the pinpoint of light.\" The spiral was \"like pouring milk into coffee.'.' . Astronomer Karl Kamper at the David Dunlap, Observatory in Richmond Hill, Ontario, described the object as starlike surrounded by a small .spiral cloud (he told newsmen the spiral (continued on page 16) ,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"BANKSONS LAKE UFO By Virginia 77//y Virginia Tilly is a Michigan MUFON field investigator. At approximately 10:30 p.m. on Friday, August 1', 1986, John Long.arid Richard Jandura f were fishing from a small boat in the middle of Banksoris Lake in Van Bureri -County Michigan... Suddenly Long noticed what appeared to be the landing light of a large aircraft approaching from, the south/southeast at an incredibly low altitude. As this was in the direction of the Kalamazoo County Airport, Long felt 1 that it might be preparing to attempt a landing there. He was concerned, however, that there were no runways there, to accomodate so large a craft/Could this unknown object with what seemed to be a landing light be looking for a sparsely populated 'area to attempt an emergency landing? ' The object was perhaps 200-300 feet high and about as long as a football field. In' describing the object as we talked in 'Kalamazoo/Long looked at Wings Stadium and said that it was at least that large. A steady white light was emitted from what appeared to be the front, while 3 red lights blinked steadily on its outer edges. When it was almost' directly in front of them and' over 'the water, the white light suddenly made a brilliant flash and went out.'.Long's blood pressure shot up when this occurred. (In the past he had been hospitalized for high blood pressure so was familiar'with what was happening to ' him.) He became very upset emotionally during this part of the experience,- and after the flash both men were scared and shaky for some time. During our discussion he also pointed out that neither man had been consuming alcohol, using drugs, nor taking.any medication. HEATWAVES? The sky was clear that night arid other conventional aircraft were spotted during the sighting. The surrounding countryside was very still with no noticeable wind so the water Kalamazoo Gazette was very calm. At this point they realized that there had never been any sound coming from this huge craft. As they watched it passing over the nearby trees and water, the red ; lights continued to blink and the men noticed what Long described as a \"magic carpet effect\". This was what appeared to be waves or a wavy effect between the blinking lights. No scents or temperature changes were .ever observed by the witnesses. However, Long speculated that the wavy effect might be heat rays. Likewise, no color nor markings were ever seen although they did feel that it was definitely a solid object. Long was sure that it was not a weather balloon, a helicopter, nor any airplane or jet. Within 15 minutes it had passed out of view in the northwest:' Long reflected that it was going in the general direction of South Haven on' Lake Michigan where the Palisades^ Nuclear Power Plant is located. He also speculated on the possibility that it was \"taking pictures or energizing\" during the flash. Long feels very strongly that this craft does not belong to the United States — and if it did it should not have been flying where it was. He also had a feeling that it was looking for something. During the sighting he also recalled having said, \"If they are from another intelligence, they are more intelligent and have a cure for cancer.\" During this sighting at least 3 other boats were on the lake. But if they were looking in the wrong direction Long mused, they probably would not have seen : anything unusual\" There were, however, several people on the shore •who saw it as the witnesses heard,a lot of animated discussions going on. Long was also concerned about a young boy about\"'10 years old who kept shouting, \"What is it?\" So far I have had rio luck in locating him. • UFO REPORTED ' After the sighting Long went to the airport but found the radar tower had closed at ll p.m. (The supervisor of the,, Kalamazoo -, County Airport radar tower told me that there was nothing unusual sighted that night.

Nelson Willard Nelson is a former state section director for Orange County, California.    . . After a private pilot and his wife witnessed a mid-air flyby of .a brightly J shining 'object during, the afternoon of May 11, 1986, his strongest impression was: \"Helta sense of awe.\" He had just made every effort to identify the fast- moving object which was closing on them from straight, ahead, in the flight path of their Cessna 172: It missed them but came close enough so they.could see that its shape was similar to a half- sphere ;.with a flat or slightly rounded bottom.  '.;.•\"•.. About the. witnesses: Robert H. Henderson is minister of the Valley of the Sun Religious Science Center, in Phoenix. He and his wife, Nann, have been friends of my wife and myself .for several years. Knowing of my interest in\" UFOs; he sent me 'a written, objective report after this suprise encounter. I phoned to get additional information and permission to use his name in a report to MUFON. The Hendersons were 25 miles south of Sedona, Arizona, traveling north at 8500 feet in their Cessna-172. It was 4;00 PM. They were almost to Verde Valley. Bob Henderson first saw a light (or reflection), estimated to be about 20 miles away, moving west. \"I'm quite sure of the distance,\" he said, \"because I had just measured it on the Sectional Chart.\" BRIGHT FLARE The weather was clear and visibility unlimited. \"I first thought it was sunlight reflecting from an auto, but it moved too fast. 1 lost sight of it temporarily, then saw a very bright object heading almost straight toward us. I prepared to take, evasive action, but it was immediately, evident that it would pass to our. left and below. I estimate it passed less than a mile to our left and probably less than a thousand 8 feet below.\" . After the sighting, he goes through the classic 'escalation of .hypotheses.' \"My first thought was 'airplane' but it was moving too fast. Then I thought : 'helicopter'' and the same : objection came.to mind. As it went by abeam and to our left, a little below us, I could not make out what it was. My reactions: 'Definitely riot an airplane, no wings, not a chopper,.no rotor....it is about twice the size of a 'bubble' helicopter.... more .compact than an airplane would be. Too rhuch glare, to see •details....impression is. that.it was a modified half-sphere, with the flat side down.\" .Nann, the only other occupant of the Cessna,. describes the UFO . in similar terms, adding: \"The front seemed rounder as it approached...as it passed by, the front looked a little more pointed and the roundness was in the back, more like a teardrop. The bottom was convex rather than perfectly flat: The bright silvery light came from the top of the object. It didn't look like the upper part had any seams.\" \"All this, happened faster than the description,\" Bob said, \"because it was moving.at a high rate of speed and we were traveling at 115 mph in the opposite direction. Closure from first sighting 20 miles away was less than one minute.\" This calculates to a minimum closure speed of 1200 mph. \"Ordinarily it would not be possible to see an airplane-sized object • 20 miles distant. In this case the bright light, whether self-generated or a reflection of the sun, made visibility possible. \"Subjectively, it simply did not/ee/ like an airplane. It was flying in an absolutely straight line from first sighting to the time it passed from view. The simplest explanation of the bright light is that it did reflect the sun. But it is hard to expjain how the light could remain so constantly and uniformly bright if it was a reflection of the sun. Without investigating the possibilities of different shapes reflecting, it would seem that at some point ^ from dead ahead to the 'nine-o'clock' or even 'eight-o'clock' position — the angle of . the, sun would change,, and the perceived light would vary. This did not happen.\"      • SIMILARITY This; sighting is especially interesting because of strong similarity with another pilot's sighting, reported in the MUFON Journal eight years ago: \"Veteran Pilot Sights Daylight Disc,\" by Richard Hall, MUFON Journal #122, January 1978. That, too, was a daylight sighting by the pilot of a Cessna, Floyd Hallstrom, of : an approaching dome- shaped UFO. The Cessna and the UFO were in the Los Angeles International Airport Terminal Control Area, going in opposite directions at nearly the same altitude. The UFO came even.closer, moving steadily at a slower relative speed. It passed to the left and below the witness' plane. His description was detailed, including report of a bright- spot sun reflection off the dome as the UFO passed by. It is .interesting that Bob Henderson wrestled with the question of whether it was a self-generated light bright enough, to be visible in broad daylight, or whether it was a reflection of sunlight. During my follow-up phone call he speculated that a reflection from a highly polished hemisphere might not change with sun angle. \"But it sure seemed abnormally bright,\" he said, and added: \"I do not claim what it is, just what we saw.\" MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

Torrey Jr. was witness to a strange spectacle in the sky over Ozone Park, a section of Queens County, one of the five boroughs of New York City. What he saw puzzled and disturbed him, but like most people he did not know who to contact in regard to the matter. Serious research groups like MUFON and CUFOS were not known to the witness. He did write a letter to the Editor of the Daily News (N.Y.C.), but never received a reply. In April 1978, he read an article on UFOs that appeared in an issue of the National Enquirer. Not knowing who to turn to, Fred Torrey wrote a letter to the Enquirer in early May describing his observation, asking them for assistance in trying to find a logical answer for what he saw. His letter was then sent to Ted Bloecher of N.Y.C. for further inquiry. Ted, who, at that time was one of the leading lights in serious UFO research, sent me a copy of Torrey's letter and requested that I look into the matter. I contacted the witness by telephone, in which he confirmed the basic points of his letter to the Enquirer. I then sent him a UFO sighting questionnaire, which he filled out and sent back to me. Included were detailed sketches of the objects as seen 1 from 2 angles of observation. The account was now complete. Before getting to the substance of the sighting itself, the solid nature of the witness himself should be pointed out. Fred Torrey was 56 years old, and had good vision with eyeglasses, good hearing, and was in fair health. He was retired after 27 years of employment in the aerospace field. This long particular job employment enabled him to be familiar with many types of aircraft and space vehicles. The witness sought no publicity or notoriety; in fact, he feared to tell anyone but his wife. He did want a logical answer to satisfy his own puzzlement and curiousity. CIGAR SHAPES Now to the incident itself. It was about 8:30 PM, somewhere between the 16th-20th of August: The ;sky was clear with no clouds, and a few stars were visible. It was a very warm evening, and Fred went to the rear yard, hoping to cool off (he had no air conditioning). Something caught his eye to the north. It was 3 lighted objects appearing to have a cigar shape. Each object emitted a pale ray of light from the bottom. It was a broad beam, and he knew from his 27 years of aerospace background that these were not landing lights. The objects seemed almost motionless, and the witness, by now most curious, decided to study them and make mental notes. Fortunately, the three objects were moving slowly in his direction, from north to south. They were moving very slowly, perhaps no more than l / 2 mile per hour (floating would accurately describe their \"speed\"). The three objects formed a triangle, with one leading in front. Fred looked carefully to see if they were attached to some kind of familiar object such as a balloon or helicopter, or even attached to one another, but none could be seen. As they came closer to the witness he could now see that their true shape was circular. Their altitude appeared low, no more than 200-300 feet. Each object had an apparent size much larger than a full moon, with the tight group occupying a total area of some 4- 5 full moon diameters across. When they reached a position exactly overhead Fred almost fell backward looking straight up at the underpart of the objects. They were about the same brightnesses the moon, with splotches of brighter spots mixed in, and emitted a weak ray of light into his yard. He estimated the true size of each round object to be between 20-25 feet in diameter. The witness listened very carefully for sounds of a motor, or even a hum. He heard absolutely NOTHING. The objects did not revolve, and each had a rim around it. As they slowly moved to the south, they suddenly disappeared. After some 45 minutes, the spectacle was now over. NEAR AIRPORT The locale of the incident was residential, located some three miles from Kennedy Airport. This raises a nagging question; did anyone else other than Fred Torrey witness this amazing sight? Considering the residential nature of the area, the lengthy three- quarter hour duration of the event, and the nature of what was seen, the answer would seem to be yes. Yet, if witnesses to this spectacle exist other than Fred Torrey, they remain unknown both to him and to this investigator. Perhaps a house-to-house canvassing of the whole neighborhood would have been needed to definitively answer this question. Since this was,not done, this aspect of the incident remains unresolved. There can be no question that Fred Torrey saw what he said he saw. His initial letter to the National Enquirer, for instance, was in essence a plea for assistance to help find .an answer for the sight he witnessed. But were the 3 round objects actual UFOs, or something far less mysterious? Clearly nothing of an astronomical nature is involved, nor were they conventional aircraft or helicopters. The' lengthy duration of the sighting, plus • the very slow movement of the objects, does suggest that some type of balloon explanation might offer a possible explanation for this event. Based on the reported facts, however, such an explanation would be a very forced fit."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"LORENZEN, COMPUTERS NEWS 'N' VIEWS APRO FOUNDER Jim Lorenzen, International Director of Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) died August 28, 1986 in Tucson, Arizona at the age of 64. Funeral services were held September 2,1986 at the Unitarian Universalist Church. He and his wife Coral founded APRO in January 1952 while living in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. They have coauthored five books on UFOs: Flying Saucer Occupants (1968); UFOs Over the Americas (1969); UFOs - The Whole Story (1969); Encounters:with UFO Occupants (1976); and Abducted! (1977). Mr. Lorenzen has served as the International Director of APRO since 1964. Walt Andrus first met Jim in July 1969 when he and his wife visited the Lorenzens in their Tucson: home. During'the intervening years, Jim and Walt renewed their friendship at several UFO Conferences and personal meetings. As one of the pioneers in the field of Ufology, Mr. Lorenzen will be best remembered for the fine UFO books that he coauthored with his wife Coral. In addition to his widow, Mr. Lorenzen leaves a son, Larry in Phoenix and a married daughter in Tucson. A floral arrangement was sent to the church for the funeral and a sympathy card mailed to Mrs. Lorenzen and family from everyone in the Mutual UFO Network. PERSEUS LIGHT Of interest to UFOlogists and to both amateur and professional astronomers is an unexplained light that sometimes flashes from the area of the constellation Perseus. It was reported in the Aug. 1, 1986, Astrophysical Journal Letters. An article about it also appeared in the August 23, 1986, Science News. 10 L.J. Lorenzen The flashes appear between the Pleiades and Algol. They last less than a second, may be as bright as Venus (-2 magnitude), and were first noticed in August, 1983. One flash has been photographed and a spectrum of this image matches that of the sun. The flashing does not show any noticeable periodicity. Astronomers do not know what the flashes are, but they may attempt to examine their distance from them by triangulation. I contacted a local astronomy professor to ask if this information had been reported previously. He believed that it had, but he couldn't remember where. Since this phenomenon can be observed by the unaided eye, it provides a good opportunity for the observation and recording of astronomical information. In the same issue of Science News it is reported that Riccardo Giacconi, the director of NASA's Space Telescope Science Institute, is offering some time on the Hubble Space Telescope to a few amateur astronomers. -Irena Scott NETWORK CUFON, the Computer UFO Network, now has over 700 members and users,- and most of them are MUFON members.

(4:10 a.m. to 4:30 a.m.) The , time involved is about 20 minutes, therefore the average speed was 72 m.p.h. All witnesses thought the object was moving slowly. Sue Harte and Wanda Madson saw the object while together, however Sue reported 4 lights that were white, whereas Wanda saw. 2 white lights and a. small red light. All other witnesses saw 4 lights. The San ; Francisco Chronicle speculated that the object was an ultralight aircraft. I.checked with the director of Petaluma's Liberty Field, near where the sightings occurred and was told that no one was. flying at that time.

Sunrise on May 22,1986"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"was 5:54 a.m. POST. CONCLUSION In attempting to sum up the Petaluma UFO Case, I feel that it is important to present both an argument in favor of ah IFO and one favoring a UFO. Witnesses generally spoke of lights that were unusual for-an aircraft, but \"not that unusual.\" The lights observed by the witnesses .were generally described as white. Some witnesses described them as having a green hue. Obviously missing.was the white anit-collison strobe light which aircraft are required to carry. The witnesses on three occasions described the object moving in such a direction that the green light would be showing in their direction. The one instance in which a witness saw a red light was by Wanda Madsqn, whereas Sue Harte did not. The fact that the object appeared to hover a number of times would tend to indicate the possibility of a helicopter. UFO Considering that most people are aware of normal aircraft. lighting, it is interesting that upward of 12 people called in to say that they had seen something unusual. Most people are capable of distinguishing between normal and abnormal lights, for an aircraft. In one case, a witness stopped her car, turned off the engine and radio, stepped outside and heard no sound. I also called airports. in the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento, Calif, area and could not • find any helicopters that were going through this locale at this time. I even checked with the George Lucas Special Effects Organization and they advised they were doing nothing on that morning. Lack of sound, lights unusual enough for witnesses to telephone in and no known helicopters transient through the area would indicate a UFO. IFO None of the witnesses could accurately determine the distance and height of the object. All but one witness was in a moving car with their windows Artist's rendition of UFO based on Petaluma eye witness accounts rolled up, thus they could make no accurate determination about sound. No witness could distinguish the shape of the object. This leaves the Petaluma UFO Case with very few solid details in order to definitely classify the sighting as an IFO or UFO at press time. -Tom Page BANKSONS, Continued no negative reactions and some people even say that they are envious of his experience.

By John Schuessler \" John Schuessler of Houstpri is MUFOIM's deputy director and chief investigator of the ,Cash- Landrum Case. On'December 29,. 1980, Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum and Colby Landrum encountered an unusual flying object and a large number of twin- rotor helicopters along a deserted road northeast of Houston, Texas. As the result of that encounter their lives were ' changed forever. They sustained life threatening injuries and have undergone long periods of suffering. They were'advised by the military- legal authorities at Bergstrom Air Force Base in Austin, Texas to;file a claim against the United. States government for the injuries they sustained. They did file the claim, which was later rejected. The appeal was also rejected. They were then told to sue the United States Government in Federal Court. Again, they followed.instructions and filed a civil action in the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston, Texas. Their contention was that they.had been wronged, physically injured, while driving on a public thoroughfare.-The United States Government'was at fault because their injuries were sustained while they were in close proximity of the millifary helicopters and the large glowing object, later called a UFO for lack of a better term. : .  : . . DATE SET The United States District Court Docket Call was set for September 3, 1985. Frank Conforti, Assistant United States Attorney, requested dismissal or a summary judgement-in favor of the United States. The attorney for Cash 'and Landrum-replied'that the United States was not entitled to a dismissal or a summary judgement. Judge Ross Sterling did not make a decision on Mr. Conforti's request. Therefore, the case did not go to trial. Nearly one year later, on August 12 CH-47 Helicopter 21, 1986, Judge RossSterhngdismissed the case on the basis of expert testimony submitted by Mr Conforti. The experts addressed the issue of whether or not the United Stales owned and opeiated a device as described by Cash and Landrum and sidestepped the issue of military .helicopters'. The claims of the experts are summarized below. , Robert W. Sommer, Chief of the NASA Aircraft ..Management Office, avowed that \"no object as described by the plaintiffs was, at any time, owned or operated, or was in the inventory or .under the control of NASA.\"Headded that NASA did have one twin-rotor helicopter, but it was in a hangar in California on the date of the incident. Colonel William E Krebs, Chief, Tactical Aeronautical Systems Division, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Systems, Air Force Systems Command, United States Air Force, has been involved in development, testing and evaluation of all United States Air Force craft capable of flight He said ,\"no such craft was owned, operated, or is in the inventory of the United States Air Force . \" Further, he said \"1 have never seen nor heard of any such craft. . . being associated with the military service\" While he did not address all twin rotor helicopters, he did declare that the CH-47 was not in the inventory of the United States Air Force.

Their new mailing address is 4732 N. Windridge Loop, Tucson, Arizona 85749. By now, P.1..P.E. (public information & public education) is undoubtedly a familiar acronym to MUFON UFO Journal readers, but since many of our members may be wondering who the P.I.P.E. Committee members are and what they've accomplished, we offer the following report: MUFON Public Relations Director, Marge Christensen serves as chairperson for the committee, which is made up of the following members: Walter Webb, Barry Greenwood, Jim Melesciuc, :-and- Ray Fowler, of Massachusetts; as well as John Schuessler, Walt Andrus, and Dennis .Stacy, of Texas; Dan Wright, Michigan, Paul Cerny, California, Mildred Biesele, Utah, Fred Whiting, Virginia, .and Bob Bletchman, Connecticut. The committee has been in existence for three years, however, there have been some changes in membership during that time. Over the past two years,, the committee has engaged in many projects aimed at providing public information on the UFO subject. Some of these include: • (1) Compiling and producing two sets of slides with narratives for use in the presentation of lectures on the UFO subject (2) Initiating National UFO Information Week as an annual event, and compiling a package of materials for use during this week. The package, which has been distributed to all State Directors, includes, a poster, public service announcements for .radio stations, a press release, a suggested bibliography, and a MUFON information page. (These items are to be copied by State Directors for circulation throughout their respective states.) (3) Writing a media policy, currently submitted to the MUFON Board of Directors for approval, and subsequently, to be submitted for publication in the Journal. . (4) Initiating the Award for Outstanding Work in the UFO Field each calendar year. (5) Responding to negative publicity in -the printed or electronic media whenever la situation needing such a response occurs. (6) Lecturing widely on the UFO subject. (7) Furnishing' materials and information to others offering public information on the UFO subject. (8) Publishing a monthly Newsletter for State Directors to keep them informed, and publishing a monthly P.I.P.E. Line for committee members. (9). Compiling the .national telephone network, TELUFONET. As we look ahead to 1987,. the P.I.P.E. Committee is already making preparations for. new endeavors. These include the following: . (1) The Committee will work with the-Fund for UFO Research (host of the MUFON 1987 UFO Symposium) to ensure record high attendance at the 1987 MUFON UFO Symposium scheduled to be held on June 26-28, in Washington, D.C. P.I.P.E. members will be drafting letters to make available to MUFON members, conveying the importance of the UFO subject and emphasizing the need to attend the symposium. These will be used as models for personal letters for everyone to send to their U.S. Congressmen nationwide. (2) A national campaign to encourage both university and public libraries to add subscriptions to the MUFON UFO Journal to their collections will be launched. . (3) Plans will again be made for the Third National UFO Information Week, with a few. modifications in order to cover a wider geographic area of the United States. (4) The Award for Outstanding Work • in the UFO Field will be continued, but the nomination process has been revised, and will be explained in-an upcoming issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. It would appear the the P.I.P.E. Committee is currently the only long- term working committee MUFON has on a national scale. What can be learned from the experiences of the committee? First of all, it is possible for UFOIogists of varying backgrounds, ; stretching from coast-to-coast to work together, and to produce significant projects regularly. P.I.P.E. members communicate on a regular basis via telephone, correspondence, or the P.LP.E. Line Newsletter. This has fostered a sense of belonging and has served to strengthen our commitment as individuals to the cause of informing the public about the reality of the UFO phenomenon and the need to afford it scientific respectability as a legitimate area of study. A genuine continual exchange of ideas and information takes place on this committee, and its members share equally in the work of the committee. Perhaps the same could be true of committees on other topics if they were to be formed to serve as working committees on specific topics. For example, suppose there was a committee to study reported abduction cases and their implications for humanity? This committee could meet annually at symposia, as does the P.I.P.E. Committee, and its members could be persons who investigate abduction cases. The committee could be chaired by someone such as Budd Hopkins.

The.testimony of other witnesses to the UFO events is presented, along with a review of the photos, films and metal samples which have been discussed in depth in the two previous videotapes. Perhaps the most interesting portion of this presentation is an informal interview with Meier in which he quietly discusses the information allegedly obtained from extraterrestrial beings. If you are one of those \"scientific Ufologists\" who think, that a contactee's only problem is counting his money, this presentation might give you something else to consider.

LETTERS (Last issue we published a letter by Philip Klass in which he asserted that the UFO chased by Thomas Mantell was indeed a Skyhook balloon launched from Wilmington AFB, Ohio, under CIA auspices. The letter was in response to an article by staff writer T. Scott Grain, whose rejoinder should have been published at that time. My apologies to Mr. Grain. -Ed.) Dear Editor, I have no argument with • Philip Klass that Wilmington Air Force Base was a launching site for the Navy's skyhook balloon program in the 'late 1940s. The question to be answered is whether or not a skyhook balloon was launched from the Base on January 5, 1948, the day Mantell died. '. , Edwart J. Ruppelt, former head of the Air Force Project investigating UFOs, writes in his book, The Report on UFOs (p.56) that he could never find the records showing \"whether or not a balloon was launched from Clinton County AFB, Ohio, on January 7, 1948.\" \"People who were working with the early skyhook projects \"remember\" operating out of Clinton County AFB in 1947 but refuse'to be pinned down to a January 7 flight.\" Yet Philip Klass states that Ruppelt and others in the USAF UFO program \"could only be told the meagerest of information about the Skyhook balloon secretly launched from Wilmington Air Force Base, ; some 30 miles southeast of Dayton.\" Klass seems to infer; that a skyhook balloon was secretly'launched on January 7, and that's what Mantell chased. •/ ,  , ; •\"•' . \\ ./.'.• I've said it before and I'll say it again. Produce the records and name the people involved. Several years back, space scientist James Ober'g wrote confidently in his December 1978 article \"Venus: Queen of the UFOs\" for OMM that \"although \"Venus was off the hook,\" the solution to Mantell's death became obvious when \"...investigators came . across declassified records of a giant, stratospheric spy balloon launched upwind of the sighting area a few hours earlier.\" In 1982,1 challenged Oberg to produce the records and name the investigators. Oberg replied, \"My only documentation is an anonymous note on the Mantell case file, saying it was a Skyhook, plus circumstantial evidence that during that period Skyhooks apparently were being flown from the site that was upwind of Mantell on thw day of the crash.\" An \"anonymous note\" and \"circumstantial evidence\" does not decide the fate of a military pilot. Oberg continued, \"My statement that records had been found specifying that date was wrong.\" I believe Philip Klass's assertions are wrong, too. He even admits in his own book \"UFOs Explained\" (p. 39), \"...that the precise date of launch of one of the Skyhook balloons from the southern Ohio site is not known...\" If anything, the most definitive statement .made about the Skyhook . balloon flight of 1948 comes from David R. Saunders, former investigator for the Colorado UFO Project. In his book, UFOs? YES! (p. 65) which he co- authored with R. Roger Harkins, a reporter for the Boulder Daily Camera, it says \"...contrary to the Air Force report, .there were no sky hooks released from Clinton County Airport on January 7, 1948, nor for two days afterward.\" T. Scott Grain, Jr. Port Matilda, PA Dear Editor, The article entitled \"Is This Adamski's Saucer?\" written by Charles F. Eckhardt which appeared in the July issue of the MUFON Journal was probably the worst form of journalism that I've seen in a Jong time. It was obviously a childish and mindless attempt to continue to discredit the early contactee George Adamski who has been dead now for twenty-one years and is still being bitterly attacked by people who have never met him, nor in most cases have never even read the books which,he wrote. Most of what has been disseminated about Adamski is second- hand information which has been passed on over the years from one debunker to another and much of it has never been verified or confirmed. It's simply, \"old wives\" tales with a few embellishments thrown in to try to lend some credibility to the them that Adamski was an uneducated hoaxer (he didn't have a college degree) but then who really cares? I only wish that such so-called \"knowledgeable\" people as author Eckhardt would take the time and make the effort to investigate before making false accusations and inventing theories which are only speculative in nature. Wouldn't it be worth Mr. Eckhardt's time to at least read \"George Adamski: The Untold Story\" written by Lou Zinsstag and Timothy'Good, published by Ceti Publications of England in 1983? Maybe then the critics of the late Adamski would have some stumbling blocks to counter in their unfounded diatribes which continue unabated thirty-four years after his famous encounter with an alien who landed his spacecraft in the California desert on that momentous day in 1952. . I think perhaps Mr. Eckhardt should find it worthwhile to know that Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands permitted Adamski a long audience with them in 1959 and were very much interested in Adamski's contact with an alien eight years before. Likewise, how does Eckhardt interpret the audience that Adamski had with Pope John XXIII on May 30, 1963 when the little understood (continued next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"LETTERS, continued Adamski was admitted to St. Peter's through a private entrace and ushered in by an aide to see the ailing Pope at his bedside? ..

Church died? , •' r ' •; '. ' , ' . In fact, the entrance of Adamski to the Vatican was witnessed by the late . ,Lou Zinsstag, a relative of the late Carl Gustav Jung, famed Swiss psychologist and May Morlet, a'.Belgian co-worker of Ms. Zinsstag's. It is also worthy of mention that persons of impeccable credentials such as William T. .Sherwood, an optical physicist and a senior . project development, engineer for Eastman Kodak Company of Rochester, New York had analyzed the 8mm movie film taken by Adamski ..and Madeleine Rodeffer in Silver Springs, Maryland on February 26, 1965 of a UFO and found the frames to be authentic and not faked in any manner whatsoever. Leonard Cramp an aeronautical designer and engineer wrote in his first book, \"Space, Gravity and The Flying Saucer\" that Adamski's controversial photographs were authentic and obviously not fraudulent. If author Eckhardt will take the time to read Zinsstag's book and refer to pages 175 through 178 which discuss Adamski's famous and yet controversial 1952 photos .; of the \"scoutcraft,\" which according to Eckhardt were merely lampshades of the 1920's period, then I think that he may want to reevaluate his derogatory remarks and reaccess his criticism of the much maligned Adamski, who has been supported by such luminaries as Brinsley LePoer Trench, Frank Edwards, Frank Scully, Lady Falkender, personal and political secretary to former Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Great Britain, Prof. Hans Holzer of New York Institute of Technology, Major Hans Petersen (Ret.) of the Danish Air Force, 16 Waveney .Girvan, former editor of \"Flying Saucer Review,\" and Carol Honey, a West. Coast aerospace engineer who for many years was a staunch supporter of George'Adamski. Before taking the encounters that Adamski claims to have had light|y, I would strongly suggest further research before heaping ridicule upon a man who has been dead now for over twenty years.

Chaffce ''••'. , Belmont, MA UFO, Continued could have been fuel .spilling from a damaged satellite, and said it must have been extremely high in the sky). Chuck Barnes, head naturalist at the Troy Farm and Nature Center near Detroit, had been giving an outdoor lecture on meteors when the UFO appeared: \"It was glowing like a spiral pinwheel standing on end and moving on a line from southeast to northwest\", he told newsmen (the motion was, actually from SE to northeast); \"It appeared to be five or six times larger than a full moon.\" In Massachusetts, an amateur astronomer watched the plume from the rocket perform two full turns in four minutes, painting the spinning spiral as he watched. The relevance of these perceptions to other UFO reports is connected with a series of night-time sky spirals seen over China in the late 1970s. While UFO enthusiasts have accepted them uncritically, experienced analysts have voiced the suspicion that they actually involved space launchings (much like the H-l over America on August 12). These intuitive suspicions were encouraged by a recent official Chinese disclosure of the cancellation of the \"Windstorm\" space booster, which through the 1970s was being developed in competition to the \"Long March 3\" booster; there . were several flight'tests, including one unsuccessful 1 satellite launching, although precise dates were not provided. Further disclosures may allow a precise connection between \"Windstorm\" space shots and the \"spiral UFOs\" over China. Another interesting phenomenon was the way in which UFO groups seemed . to get a different type of descriptions, than did the national news media. Robert Gribble of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle got more than a hundred telephone calls, consistently describing an object shooting straight up into the sky until it mushroomed at a certain altitude (\"It seemed to hold in a certain airspace\", . he recalled, adding \"I got NO reports of it moving across the sky\"). Sherman Larson, with the Center for UFO Studies in Illinois, said his. group received numerous calls: \"In each case, witnesses said an object appeared to have exploded in the sky .and then moved into a cloud.\" In these accounts, sub-conscious interpreta-, tions by .the collectors had evidently colored the straightforward pure per- ceptions, and without other accounts the stories collected by the UFO groups could well have coagulated into a \"true UFO\" if the solution had not been published so quickly. This is a long-recognized (but evidently still . serious) problem with anecdotal data collection. . , All in all, the great cloud UFO of August 12, 1986 was an exciting, illuminating experience, in more ways than one! .  .

NOVEMBER, Continued The Stars: This month places the six constellations in the royal family legend into prominence. (The story was highlighted in the movie Clash o} the Titans.) The characters are Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Perseus, Andromeda, Pegasus, and Cetus. The lengthy adventure culminates when Andromeda is saved from the jaws of Cetus. Her rescuer Perseus displays the cut-off Medusa's head. The creature's stare turns Cetus to stone, and Perseus and Andromeda ride off on the back of Pegasus the Winged Horse. Winter star patterns, such as Orion and Taurus, show up in the east now at 9 PM. The dipper-shaped star cluster known as the Pleiades is one of the feature attractions of Taurus and in fact of the entire sky. It is a spectacular si'ght, especially in binoculars and telescopes. On November evenings the Big Dipper has swung down above the northern horizon as low as it ever gets.

It was kicked off by the very successful Massachusetts MUFON Forum in Beverly, Massachusetts on the weekend of August 9 and 10. The featured speakers were Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Philip Imbrogno, Dr. Richard F. Haines, Budd Hopkins and Dan Wright. The Forum attracted an audience from 16 states and from Argentina. Marge Christensen 'has submitted an article to the MUFON UFO Journal with photos covering the highlights of National UFO Information Week and plans for 1987. Walter Webb will report on the UFO Forum. In order to concentrate maximum attendance and national publicity for the MUFON 1987 UFO Symposium in Washington, D.C., the Massachusetts MUFON Forum will not be held in 1987. The MUFON 1987 International UFO Symposium will be held on the weekend of June 26, 27, and 28 at the American University in Washington, D.C. Hosted by the Fund for UFO Research, it will be spearheaded by Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, Chairman and Fred Whiting, Symposium Coordinator. The theme will emphasize the international scope of the 40 year old mystery, since it will be commemorating the fortieth anniversary of Kenneth Arnold's sighting near Mount Rainier in Washington State that initiated the modern era of Ufology in the press. In addition to inviting speakers from all continents to relate the status of Ufology in their part of the world, a new practice will be introduced whereby short contributed papers will be solicited and presented. The \"First Call for Papers\" was published in the September 1986 issue of the .MUFON UFO Journal in the column titled, \"News 'N' Views\" along with the conditions under which they will be submitted, accepted and presented. This is a standard practice for scientific society symposia. The call for papers criteria will be published again in the November 1986 issue of the Journal as a reminder. * * * It is with deep regret that we must announce the passing of another pioneer ufologist into the realm of a close encounter with his maker. L.J. \"Jim\" Lorenzen, age 64, died August 28, 1986 in Tucson, Arizona. Funeral services were held September 2 at the Unitarian Universalist Church. As International Director of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO), Jim will probably be best remembered for the fine UFO books that he co-authored with his wife, Coral. Our sympathy is extended to his widow and their two adult children. Jim provided the stability to APRO as a Director and later International Director. * * * Harriett Beech, a former State Section Director in Michigan and now retired in Puerto Plata, has been appointed the Representative for the Dominican Republic. She will follow foreign reports in the Caribbean area and Latin America. Paul E. Tyler, M.D., living in Potomac, Maryland, is a new Consultant in Radiation. He is also trained in the fields of radio-biology, aerospace medicine, and hypnosis. His prime interest in ufology concerns human encounters with reported medical effects and injuries. Clifford E. Stone (U.S. Army) has accepted the position of State Section Director for Chaves and Lincoln counties in New Mexico, reporting to John L. Warren, the State Director. Sgt. Stone's major contribution to date has been in obtaining F.O.I.A. documents of UFO military cases which he has been sharing with MUFON. Bonnie Wheeler, residing in Cambridge, Ontario, has been appointed Provincial Section Director for Southwest Ontario by Henry H. McKay.

The 1987 UFO Symposium Committee will have an extremely difficult act to follow after the superb job done by Michigan MUFON for the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium. Not only was the program offered this year by far the most impressive ever offered at a UFO Symposium, but the facilities, staffing, special activities, publicity, etc. were outstanding, with meticulous attention given to every conceivable detail.
