FROM THE EDITOR If you watched the Oprah Winfrey show on May 22, you heard one abductee, Constance Morgan, a Kansas City TV advertising account executive, describe her November 1978 abduction, beginning with what she at first thought was a huge helicopter outside her bedroom window. The \"helicopter\" of course turned out to be a UFO. It is exactly this bizarre overlap that Dennis Stillings addresses in a rather lengthy lead article. We hope you find it as thought-provoking as we did. Stillings himself is the director of the Archaeus Project. For further information, contact him at: 629 Twelfth Ave. SE, Minneapolis, Minn., 55414. Next issue holds a surprise or two in store. In the meantime, you'll find herein the controversial \"MJ 12\" documents, and the regular departments that make the Journal the best in its field.

In addition, these usually unmarked, usually black helicopters demonstrate some rather remarkable properties: they move silently or with sound unlike those of normal helicopters; they fly at abnormal, unsafe, or illegal altitudes; their behavior appears both shy and aggressive. They are reported to carry \"Oriental-looking\" people; their passage sometimes \"blisters\" the dead and mutilated animals; they \"direct\" abnormally brilliant beams of light; they hover over missile sites and military bases; often they are heard distinctly and very loudly but not seen; sometimes they look like helicopters, but sound like airplanes; they Madonna and Helicopter: In this fifteenth century French painting, the infant Jesus holds a toy helicopter operated by pulling a string wound around a spindle. It may be reasonably supposed that the object had a religious significance, perhaps symbolizing spiritual ascension or resurrection. The connection of the helicopter with \"the other side\" goes back to the very beginning. sometimes flash multicolored lights; they are observed in association with nocturnal lights; they are sometimes seen flying at abnormally high rates of speed. They are occasionally seen flying without rotors. 1 All of this sounds very much like the sorts of behaviors typically reported about flying saucers. Strangest of all, however, is that UFOs are occasionally reported to change into helicopters; and helicopters, to change into UFOs; or that helicopters are seen shortly before or after sightings of UFOs. It was the type of abnormal characteristics that are seen, and especially the reports of apparent transmogrifications, that interested me. (See below: the discussion of Trickster/Mercurius and his ability to change into many forms.) I asked myself the following question: If such phenomena were reported as occurring in a dream, how would such a dream be interpreted? Such a dream would indicate that, in some sense, an equivalence or, at least, a very close relationship between helicopter and UFOs was being suggested. Since, in reality, helicopters are not identical with UFOs, the 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"relationship must be of a different sort. It was my hypothesis that, if there was such a connection, evidence, of it would appear in the experience and activities not of individuals preoccupied with UFOs, necessarily, but of those who had been involved in the design and operation of helicopters. Since their work predates the so-called modern era of UFO sightings, reliably naive material could be expected. EARLY PROGENITORS It so happens that one of the engineers most closely involved in early helicopter design was Arthur Young, who was the leading designer of the Bell Model 47 helicopter. As luck would have it, Arthur Young published, in a book called The Bell Notes, 2 the record of his thoughts and activities during the time of his most intense efforts to design the Bell Model 47 helicopter. In Peter Dreyer's forword to the book, and in the very first paragraph, he states that Arthur Young \"had come to see the helicopter chiefly as a metaphor for the evolving spirit — the winged self which he now began to call the 'psychopter'.\" In Arthur Young's own words, \"the many headed dragon of the helicopter 3 seemed to be growing more heads all the time\" (p.32), and \"I (am) working on the psychopter within the helicopter. I experiment with the self instead of with the machine\" (p.60). Using an image borrowed from alchemy, he writes, \"Bell has become a laboratory in which I try to distill myself. The helicopter is only the vessel\" (p.86), and \"I am constantly directing myself toward attainment of the psychopter\" (p.96). Arthur Young went on to become intensely involved in psychic phenomena and metaphysics. I also checked on Igor Sikorsky, the famous Russian aeronautical engineer and pioneer helicopter designer. In 1900, at the age of 11, Sikorsky had a dream that affected him deeply. The details of the dream are very much like a Jules Verne conception of being aboard a UFO. \"I saw myself walking along a narrow, luxuriously decorated passageway. On both sides were walnut doors, similar to the staterooms of a steamer. The floor was covered by 4 an attractive carpet. A spherical electric light from the ceiling produced a pleasant bluish illumination. Walking slowly, I felt a slight vibration under my feet and was not surprised to find that the feeling was different from that experienced on a steamer or on a railway train. I took this for granted, because in my dream I knew that I was on board a large flying ship in the air.\" 4 Like Arthur Young, Sikorsky went on to write several books of a theological and metaphysical nature. 5 In 1947, he published The Invisible Encounter, a rather despairing book on the morals and fate of the twentieth century. Another, very suggestive dream- illustration of the connection between UFOs and helicopters may be found in a dream reported in a letter to C.G. Jung in 1959. 6 The writer was not, as far as I know, deeply involved with helicopters. But this is not certain. The dream is as follows: (A)n aeroplane appeared through clouds of smoke or fog (The appearance of smoke or fog is often reported to be seen prior to encounters with UFOs and UFO abduction.) Then a contraption like a helicopter descended towards the dreamer to fetch him. (There is an apparent transformation of the aeroplane into a helicopter, a type of phenomenon also reported in the UFO literature.)He saw shadowy figures which he knew to be higher types of men, with greater knowledge and \"absolutely just,\" visitors from another world. The years 1946-1947 were notable for other events of relevance to this discussion. On March 8, 1946, Arthur Young's machine, the Bell Model 47 helicopter, was awarded the world's first commercial helicopter license. The helicopter thus became part of the general culture. 7 Considerable speculation was given to the possibility that \"everyone\" might own his own device for \"genuine three dimensional travel.\" In the very next year, 1947, atmospheric straight-line flight achieved another sort of freedom: the sound barrier (sometimes called a demon in the sky) was broken by a Bell X-15 rocket plane. In addition, the world ground-speed record was established in 1947. Following Churchill's Iron Curtain speech of the previous year, 1947 was termed the \"Year of Division.\" And, of course, 1946-1947 marks the beginning of the modern era of flying saucers. The theme of splitting was not only a feature of postwar science and politics, but manifested in the technology of the time as well. It seems as though the flight characteristics of the UFO — enormous straight-line velocities combined with the ability to hover and to move at right angles and in all directions — were reproduced by us in the best way we could: by means of our rockets and helicopters. Unable to combine the astounding performance characteristics of the UFO in a single device, we produced two quite different technologies, each of which mimicked only one set of UFO flight characteristics. One is tempted to view the UFO as the visible representation of a background dynamis that stimulates us to produce these technologies as partial representations of something that is, in its essence, irrepresentable arid paradoxical — a coincidental oppositorum. One is reminded of the behavior of the hero in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, who feels compelled to reproduce in material form a vague and elusive unconscious image. \"PSYCHOPTER\" One may further speculate that this background dynamis was in some sense stimulated to reveal itself in the form of the irrational and myth- provoking UFO, that man's accomplishment in producing supersonic rocket planes and reliable helicopters had evoked a response. It was as if this hidden element were now saying. \"No, that is not exactly it, that is not the whole picture. A merely technological representation is not ultimately satisfactory, so here is something for you really to think about!\" The UFO thus emerges as a sort of tertium quid, an image or representation of the transformative element of the mind related to human creativity. Arthur Young addresses himself to this point several times in The Bell Notes. He writes:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"What is the psychopter(?) The psychopter is the winged self. It is that which the helicopter usurped — and what the helicopter was finally revealed not to be. Fundamentally I am trying to get out of the helicopter not because it is what it is, but because I believe in the psychopter. The construction of the psychopter is not advanced by plunging again into the helicopter, it is advanced by trying to distill the helicopter. So that from the point of view of the psychopter, which is the important one, the only commitments toward the helicopter which should presently be stressed are indirect ones (p.67).\" Young refers to his book as \"[a] notebook on [a] machine that is much more complicated and subtle than the helicopter. The machine is my mind and body, with which I experiment every day, through which I will eventually achieve the end I seek, for I always knew it was not the helicopter. Here is a great experiment indeed (p.38).\" From these quotations we gather that this individual, Arthur Young, who was deeply absorbed by the problems of designing the helicopter, felt the machine to be an inadequate external representation of an inner driving force to which he was totally committed. He saw the psychopter/helicopter problem as related to the nature of his own mind and body. It is of interest here that Jule Eisenbud has referred to the UFO phenomenon as an \"into-our- experience-body\" event. 8 The biophysicist Otto Schmitt asks us to consider experiences like apports and, by extension, the phenomena of UFOs, as examples of what he terms \"matrix inversion\" - i.e., that instead of arising from the action of an external object on the sensorium, the \"perception\" event may be primary, with the external object arising as a secondary phenomenon - a point of view not inconsistent with traditional teachings of Eastern philosophy. 9 We already know that certain forms of mental disorder are accompanied by the loss of the sense of body boundaries. 10 Often this condition is accompanied by a view of the body as an extended machine.\" This condition has been well conceived by the UFO- naive artist who produced the lithograph titled \"Air Machine.\" This ET/helicopler illustrating cereal box. UFO-like image has clear resemblances to a machine, yet it is obviously of a very gigantic nature. It is composed of sinews and skeletal tissue that strongly suggest the parts of one or more human bodies. This \"flask\" or uas hermeticum of tissue is surmounted by a pair of wings 12 in the position of the rotors of a helicopter. The whole of the object seems to be emerging out of the metaphysical background of existence. Another artist, Richard Thompson, upon being shown the manuscript of this paper by Dennis Stacy of MUFON, became very excited about the UFO-helicopter connection and sent me photocopies of several art works he has produced using the \"helicopter\" as a central element. Speaking of the peculiar phallic/ dumbbell-shaped helicopter figures he uses, Thompson says in a letter: \"Always I have wanted them to be 'copters, but not exactly — a presence—a disturbance, a bother— something just there—not quite seen, but it could be a helicopter.\" A very interesting mythology has been built up around the helicopter within popular culture. Recently, a surrealist novel was published called God's Helicopter™ in which a demonic god terrorizes the main character by means of a helicopter and its disembodied noise. Some of you may also be aware of a popular piece of UFO literature called Cod Drives a Flying Saucer, 1 * God apparently having a predilection toward these two modes of transportation. Ron Westrum 15 reports an \"abduction\" case in which the sound of a helicopter figures as a fear- provoking element. One of Budd Hopkins' \"abductee\" subjects reported that the sound of an approaching UFO closely resembled the sound made by helicopter rotors. Hollywood's fascination with the sound of helicopter rotors as an irrational fear-provoking stimulus in the hero may be seen in several movies: Apocalypse Now, Blue Thunder, and Fire/ox came immediately to mind. There is a persistent and odd tendency in film and fiction to associate the helicopter with dramatic psychological and quasi-mythological imagery. In Blue Thunder and the spinoff TV series Airwolf, the helicopters possess such advanced technology that they take on a kind of personality. In the movie Apocalypse Now helicopters are portrayed as Valkyries 16 who attack the Viet Cong to the music of Wagner. In 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"this movie a bawling calf is even hoisted and flown by helicopter to a barbecue held elsewhere by the fliers of the machines, clearly mimicking reports of cattle mutilations. While the calf is being lifted away, the company chaplain leads a group of soldiers in a recifdfion of the Lord's Prayer! I doubt if this scene derived from the conscious intent of the film makers. Perhaps the most outstanding of the many examples of modern helicopter mythology comes from the movie Iceman. In this film, the resuscitated Neanderthal shaman see's the helicopter as a divine being. The consulting anthropologist in the movie attempts to explain the relationship of a helicopter to the Neanderthal as follows: \"The helicopter is the bird, the messenger of the gods, but also a Trickster— supposed to take you to heaven, but if you've done wrong, it takes you somewhere else where you're judged for your sins.\" Here the helicopter is given the alternate roles of devil or angel as expressed in the Trickster figure. The Trickster, who is prominent in the folklore of North American Indians, is well known for his considerable ability to change into many forms. In this way he is analogous to the alchemical figure of Hermes/Mercurius, who may be said to stand for the collective unconscious itself. 17 Trickster/Mercurius is the source of both creative activity and gross deception. 18 Hermes/Mercurius/ Trickster figures have been treated at length by C.G. Jung, 19 Karl Kerenyi, 20 and Paul Radin. 21 The tricksterish nature of the phantom helicopters is well documented by Tom Adams, John Keel, and George Andrews. 22 Many connections can also be made between helicopters and Hermes/Mercurius. Like Hermes, the helicopter is a \"savior,\" a \"duty angel,\" 23 the \"Holy Helos\" 24 that rescues people from danger under the most difficult of circumstances; it is a messenger (delivery of mail, serum, etc., to remote, inaccessible places in emergencies) 25 and a psychopomp to the dead. 26 Like Mercurius, the helicopter is inherently unstable, and achieving stability is the main problem of helicopter design. It has been said that \"airplanes want to fly, helicopters 6 \"Chinese helicopter\" ol a type slill made commercially in Arkansas. want to fly apart.\" Compare this with Jung's description of the nature of Mercurius: [Winged Mercurius'] inner confrad/citons can dramatically fly apart into an equal number of disparate and apparently independent figures. 27 Other odd, imaginative statements are made about the helicopter. It is a mechanical Pegasus and \"can do anything a horse can do.\" It is a \"pterophore \" (\"wing bearer\" — also a characteristic of Hermes/Mercurius), a \"lookout in the sky,\" \"the most universal vehicle of transportation ever designed or used by man,\" and a device that \"provides the poetry of three- dimensional living.\" 28 The immediate postwar period, particularly during the years that saw the first great interest in \"flying saucers,\" / was also a time of tremendous fascination with the helicopter—as is quite apparent from the popular imagery of that time, presented above. Clearly, the helicopter was a dart board for a host of mythological, magical, and fblklorish projections closely related to the sorts of projections made onto UFOs. MUTILATION PARALLELS The Trickster projection, however, is the one of most concern to anomalists. If one examines the corpus of North American Trickster tales, one is immediately struck by the extraordinary emphasis of these stories on dismemberment, disemboweling, mutilation in general, and ano-genital mutilations in particular. In one episode. Trickster actually \"cores out the anus\" of a bear. 29 A Filipino Trickster figure, 30 the Viscera-Sucker, sucks out the entrails, body fluids, and fetuses of its animal and human victims—all forms of \"mutilation\" described in the American literature on cattle mutilation. The Trickster of Greek mythology, Hermes, also indulges in Tricksterish cattle mutilation. 31 And Jahweh, whose own Tricksterish proclivities have been noted by Jung, 32 destroys Job's sheep by fire as one of his first tests of Job's loyalty 33 and, be it noted, Jahweh speaks to Job out a whirlwind . 34 It is difficult to think of helicopters without also thinkingof the tremendous whirlwind generated by the rotors. In folklore, whirlwinds are the abode of various demons, witches, and Tricksterish elementals of ill will. 35 These wind demons are frequently cited for their maiming and killing of cattle. It is of passing interest that coyotes are given major blame for the so-called \"mutilations,\" since the name of one of the main Trickster figures in Indian folklore is \"Coyote.\" 36 It appears as though these images are still active in the psyche of modern"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":". \"Rotorless\" helicopter illustrated in Jerome Clark's article, \"The Brushy Creek UFOScare\"(FATE, May 1974, p.97). man. He changes Trickster and whirlwinds into crazy visions of bizarre helicopters, and associates those \"helicopters\" with the mutilation of cattle—in exact imitation of his \"benighted\" and \"superstitious\" forbears. But does that mean that we are dealing with purely imaginary phenomena? Not necessarily. Betty Hill reports on a phantom helicopter that produced circular patterns in the grass measuring 22.5 and 20.5 feet in diameter. 37 In the July 1986 issue of Flying Saucer Review 36 much is made of some \"mystery swirled rings\" or \"UFO nests\" found here and there in England. Reliable ufologists suspect that they are the result of helicopter pranks, while others opt for passing \"whirlwinds\" or \"dust devils.\" And, of course, the UFO buffs say that UFOs did it. By now it should be clear that whether one is a debunker, a UFO buff, or even one of the 'copter borne, all- too-human Pranksters who made the swirls, one may in reality be caught up in an age-old pattern found in myth and folklore all over the world. The UFO/Helicopter/Trickster pattern—or archetype, if you will—is a broad spectrum effect, insinuating its influence into the perceptions, the explanations, and even the staging of certain putative \"anomalies.\" It may be that when UFOs are sighted in a given area, such an event is preceded or accompanied by dreams of UFOs, decisions to read or write about UFOs, and even plans to stage fake UFO phenomena or mimic 39 them in one way or another — all arising from the same underlying dynamic. And speaking of underlying dynamics, a reader of Flying Saucer Review, concerned with the possible paranormalcy of the \"UFO nests,\" wrote a letter to the editor 40 drawing attention to two papers by William G. Roll discussing \"radial and tangential forces\" as they occur in the poltergeist phenomena. 41 It seems that when objects go flying around poltergeist agents, they do so in a manner suggestive of an extended invisible pole or bar being rapidly swung around with the agent as center. Objects close to the poltergeist agent move slower and for shorter distances, while objects farther away move greater distances faster. This leaves us with the question: Is there some real force—symbolized by spirit-infested whirlwinds,, the rotor- wash of phantom helicopters, and other mythical vortices—that underlies certain forms of individual and collective psychokinesis? ADDENDA This paper has not exactly been met with enthusiasm by believers in \"hardware\" theories of UFOs. Nevertheless, almost without exception and always with alacrity, ETHers have supplied me with strange helicopter stories: Andrija Puharich tells of a Chinook helicopter, stolen from an airfield, which could be photographed at night by a local psychic, even though the machine \"wasn't there.\" David Jacobs tells of a farmer who reported the presence of two helicopters during a strange experience. Under regressive hypnosis, the helicopters were reported to be UFOs. Berthold Schwarz tells me that Stella Lansing did psychic movies of a helicopter, and Harder related an incident of a \"helicopter that couldn't be photographed.\" I wish to add and to emphasize that, for the purposes of our argument here, it is entirely irrelevant whether any of these claimed incidents can be verified. The mere fact that the helicopter/UFO connection is so often and so typically made is the fact of importance. HOLLYWOOD HELICOPTERS Several movies have cast helicopters in roles that lend support to the ideas presented here. I will list a number of these films, pointing out features of them that tend to amplify the peculiar symbolism of helicopters. Some of my comments will be fairly impressionistic; I am taking this liberty so that the reader may judge for himself—whenever he happens to see one of these films—whether my feeling about the scenes in question makes any sense. In many cases, the mythic connections are very obvious. Apocalypse Now. Helicopters are presented as fear-provoking mechanisms; the mystical enactment of a cattle abduction and mutilation scene takes place within the context of a Vietnam combat scene; helicopters are identified with the Valkyries of Teutonic mythology (Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is played over giant loudspeakers by the atacking helicopters); a helicopter approaches a field R & R center in the form of an undefined brilliant white light; many extended cinematographic effects involving helicopters are included in the film. Blue Thunder. Helicopter is a demonic craft possessing an almost living kind of intelligence; it first appears out of a blazing sun; the helicopter is shown operating in silent mode."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Sfarman. A giant helicopter lifts and transports a crashed UFO in a manner evocative of a kind of symbolic identity; the closing scenes involve the appearance of a giant UFO around which the dozens of helicopters present cluster as though they—as machines— had an affinity to the spacecraft. The Thing (modern remake). The opening scene involves the Thing's spacecraft crashing. In the very next scene, in a kind of posf hoc parallelism, a helicopter is shown in a lengthy flying scene, followed by its gratuitous destruction. The movie deals at length with shape-shifting and mutilation. Close Encounters of the Third Kind. UFOs are identified with both helicopter and automobile behavior (a UFO comes up behind the hero's car; he thinks it is a car and waves it on. The UFO/car/helicopter rises straight up and over the hero's vehicle). In another scene (which relates back to the past one), a helicopter approaches as an undefined brilliant white light. The people present believe that it is a UFO that has come to make contact. Late in the film, a \"religious\" scene involving faith and doubt takes place among the \"twelve chosen ones\" sitting in a helicopter. After this, there is a scene involving an attempt to capture the hero and heroine by using helicopters. The helicopters spread a gas that puts everything (birds, people, etc.) around the base of the Devil's Tower to sleep. This is a reworking of the folklore motif of suspended time as one enters the realm of the unconscious (as in \"Sleeping Beauty\" and a number of other folktales), where contact with the figures termed \"extraterrestrials\" takes place, In this case, however, there is no return to reality. The hero is lost to the normal world of consciousness when he leaves with the extraterrestrial spacecraft. Similar folklore themes may be found in the movie Splash, the play Brigadoon, and in Goethe's poem Der Fischer. The theme of entrapment in the unconscious (Orpheus and Eurydice, Herakles and Peirithoos, and Lot's wife (\"Don't look back!\"—the hero of Close Encounters admonishes), are played out in the helicopter chase scene. La Dolce Vita. A long opening scene involving the transportation, by 8 The Devil and his minions buzz a metropolitan area in an antique automobile/UFO, lights on bright [Marie Corelli, The Devil's Motor (Hodder & Stoughton: New York & London, n.d. [1910])] In the dead midnight, at that supreme moment when the Hours that arepat slip away from the hours yet to be. there came rushing between Earth and Heaven the sound of giant wheels, — the glare of great lights, — the stench and the muffled roar of a huge Car, tearing at full speed along the pale line dividing the Darkness from the Dawn. The great Car flashed along with grinding, thunderous wheels, and as it flew, vast Phantom forms followed it... The forest dropped like broken reeds ... the lakes and waterfalls dried up into black and muddy waters ...the Demon of the Car swept... with the force of a mighty whirlwind ...Unto you shall be unlocked the under mysteries of Nature, and the secrets of the upper air...

The ascension of Christ is parodied by emphasizing the shadow of the statue going up the wall of a building the helicopter passes over. The Christ statue makes gestures of blessing controlled, puppetlike, by the helicopter's movements. Repo Man. An automobile gets transformed into a UFO, a helicopter is present during the final dramatic scene, and it first appears as a brilliant, undefined white light. John Keel has told me of a case in which a UFO was apparently transmogrified into an automobile. Terminal Man. The opening scene (credits over) is of helicopter lighted internally in such a way that it resembles a glass skull with a rotor on top. The helicopter is heard passing by during a murder/mutilation scene. The doctor says—at the moment—\"Like he was some sort of machine.\" The helicopter appears again at the end (revealing that the opening scene was really a flashback, since the closing scene shows the helicopter, lighted the same way, with the original crew, landing back at the pad). It is part of a S.W.A.T. team assigned to capture or kill the \"terminal man.\" Iceman. The movie opens with a view from an icy cave which contains the body of a Neanderthal shaman frozen in ice. Helicopters are the first things seen as they appear in the cave opening. A long scene follows showing a helicopter transporting the iceblock containing the frozen body back to base. It turns out that the helicopter resembles one of the gods of the shaman. The special effects heavily emphasize the god-helicopter identity. See the discussion above—and the movie. The closing lines, which appear on the screen, are I, who was born to die, Shall live, That the world of animals And the world of men May come together, I shall live. —Inuit legend"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY It is my belief that science and technology do not arise solely as the outcome of the logical operations of ego-consciousness. The case of the helicopter may be generalized to include all forms of technological innovation and scientific theorizing. Like the hero in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, we may be collectively striving to create theoretical and technological representations of a background dynamis that in itself transcends any such representations. The history of invention may thus be a sort of three-dimensional hieroglyphic, which can be decoded and read out as the history of our attempts to bring forth in tangible, material form those very divine images that we have unconsciously projected into matter. Thus God emerges, not out of a spiritual, but rather out of a material matrix. The simple inventions of the past have represented parts of the puzzle. The complex technologies of the present begin to provide more complete representations of this dynamis and thus bear with them much larger accretions of mythological and theological imagery. We are therefore realizing the essence of the Frankenstein myth by generating a biomimetic complex of \"mechanistic\" ideas and devices that becomes a more and more suitable substrate for the incarnation of the psychic. A history of technology and science cannot therefore be complete without a consideration of the imaginal psychic matrix, its forms and goals, out of which the material object arises. Analyses similar to the one which concerns us here can easily be conceived even for such items as the electric light, the cyclotron, the automobile, the computer, and the various other major and minor technologies that have arisen in the last few centuries. I believe that this will be a direction for serious study sometime in the distant future. NOTES 1. For these and more details on \"anomalous helicopters,\" see Thomas R.

Sikorsky remarked that \"During the fifty years preceding the advent of flying, there appeared a marked anticipation of the flying machine\" (p. 240). As though relating a tale of saucer travel, Sikorsky extolls helicopter flight: \"I have never been in the air in a machine that was as pleasant to fly. ... It is like a dream to feel the machine lift you gently up in the air, float smoothly over one spot for indefinite periods, move up or down under good control, as well as move not only forward or backward but in any direction.\" 5. Among these works were two pamphlets, \"The Evolution of the Soul\" and \"In Search of Higher Realities,\" and a short book, The Message of the Lord's Prayer. Sikorsky visited Egypt and the Holy Land, and Charles Lindbergh said of him that \"he mixed mysticism with science and aircraft design.\" 6. C.G. Jung, Leffers, Volume 2: 1951-1961. (Princeton University Press, 1975), p. 476. In 1954, a case occurred in France in which a UFO appeared with \"blades like a helicopter's\" (Hilary Evans, The Evidence for UFOs [Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, England: The Aquarian Press, 1983], p. 101). A flying-saucer-like variation on the \"Chinese helicopter\" was a very popular toy in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Also, \"Frisbee\" had its early beginnings at this time. Students at certain Ivy League schools used coffee can covers and similar objects for this purpose. The practice became widespread (and dangerous). Also coincident with the modem saucer era was the fad of \"beanies\" with propellers on top (echoing the \"psychopter\"), and recently (1987) I saw a breakfast food box illustrated with helicopter-shaped extraterrestrials. A helicopter service in Hawii is called \"Meriehune,\" after the \"little people\" of that state. 7. Shortly after the commercial license was granted to the Bell 47 helicopter, Arthur Young noted that \"the problem of the helicopter is now a problem of people...\" The collective symbolic nature of the helicopter was also reflected in the popular nonsensical notion of the time that everyone would soon be flying about in his own personal helicopter. 8.

For an important study of these phenomena, see Victor Tausk, \"On the origin of the 'influencing machine' in schizophrenia,\" in Robert Fliess, ed., The Psycho-analytical Reader: An Anthology of Essential Papers with Critical Introductions (New Yotk: International Universities Press, 1948). Tausk draws attention to two of the recurring forms of \"influencing machine\": the magic lantern and the cinematograph. Symbolically such devices point toward phenomena of psychological projection. Jung dreamt of UFOs as lenses and \"magic lanterns\" that projected himself as \"C.G. Jung\" (Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections, p. 323). A rather oversimplified, notion of UFOs as psychological projections is criticized by Carl Raschke in his otherwise excellent essay, \"UFOs: Ultraterrestrial agents of cultural deconstruction\" (Corona 2 [1981]: 77-86), yet he returns to a theory of projection himself at the end of the paper. It needs to be noted that the concept 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"of psychological projection (at least in Jungian theory) has undergone a number of revisions. One of the most notable efforts at revising the theory of projection is Lee Worth Bailey's paper \"Skull's lantern: Psychological projection and the magic lantern\" (Spring [1986]: 72-87), in which the notion of projection is revised in a way that can begin to account for the peculiar form of \"projection\" characteristic of saucer \"sightings.\" 12. Winged flasks, disks, and globes were a standard feature of the old alchemical iconography and stand for both the beginning (winged chaos) and the end (the winged Self) of the alchemical opus.

It was the white of piano keys, multiplied by the white of angel food, multiplied by the white of pearls and cream and snow and flour and chalk and pigeon-shit and paint, Middlebaum said. There was only one white brighter and whiter than the white that enveloped Middlebaum's room, and that was the object from which all of this white radiated. Middlebaum could see it clearly, as it approached him from the distance. \"That was the last time Willie Heinemann had ever heard from Ronald Middlebaum, but before this final transmission went dead, Willie heard the noise.

L.H. Gray; and the imposing and very dense 10- volume Handworterbuch des deutschen Aberglaubens (Berlin and Leipzig: Walter De Gruyter & Co., 1927). These and other tools while not in themselves keys' to the solution of the mysteries of anomalistics, will nonetheless educate the investigator to the fact that many \"unusual\" things are, in fact, the very basic stuff of human imagination as it has been expressed in various guises at all times and places. Modem man is not exempt from this process; more than that, modern man may be the wildest and most prolific of mythmakers in history. 36. For an introduction to the Trickster stories and legends, the reader is referred to the book American.Indian Myths and Legends, selected and edited by Richard Erdoes and Alfonso Ortiz (New York: Pantheon Books, 1984). Lest one imagine that Trickster/Coyote folklore is far from the average person's everyday consciousness, this fabled creature lives in our very living rooms as the coyote in the \"Roadrunner\" cartoons. 37.

Allen Hynek drew attention to this pervasive 1 psychological impulse to mimic UFO phenomena (OMNI [February 1985], p. 114). However, Hynek saw this as a directed attempt of the UFO phenomenon to \"muddy\" the waters. This \"muddying\" is, of course, relative to our consciousness. The Phenomenon may be a single underlying dynamic, which is then translated into several different, apparently conflicting manifestations according to the psychologies of the various humans touched by it. It is therefore not necessarily to ascribe purposefulness to the UFO phenomenon. It gets muddy because we are the mud it touches. 40. Letter from Bernard E.

Moore The accompanying document is part of the research properties of William L. Moore. Jaime H. Shandera and Stanton T. Friedman. Moore (a professional writer) and Friedman (a well-known nuclear physicist) are recognized and respected UFO researchers of long standing with solid backgrounds for factual reporting. Both have written and lectured widely on the subject. Shandera is a Los Angeles television producer with a background that includes directing a variety of news and documentary shows. In 1982, after Moore had worked more than a year-and-a-half on his own, the three teamed up on a research project that would take them further into the strange world of government involvement with Unidentified Flying Objects than anyone in the civilian field is known to have ever gone before. This project involved anonymous government agents sharing research pointers and dialogue alleging that UFOs are indeed extraterrestrial spacecraft and that certain elements of the U.S. intelligence community continue to maintain a high-level but covert interest in this phenomenon at a time when official position statements assert that there is no government interest whatsoever. Over the past seven years, the Moore-Shandera-Friedman team, working closely with a number of other associates both in the news media and within the civilian UFO community, has aggressively pursued contacts, developed sources, and carefully researched leads. Numerous interviews were conducted and many days were spent combing through records at the National Archives in Washington D.C. as well as both the Truman and Eisenhower presidential libraries and numerous similar facilities both federal and private. They can now report that considerable progress has been made. The accompanying document arrived in the mail in a plain brown wrapper at the residence of Jaime Shandera in December, 1984. A detailed and exhaustive study of every aspect of this document has been under way since then. Although we are not in a position to endorse its authenticity at this time, it is our considered opinion, based upon research and interviews conducted thus far, that the document and its contents appear to be genuine. At the very least, it is possible to state with certainty that absolutely nothing has surfaced during the course of our research which would seem to suggest otherwise. Indeed, one document was uncovered at the National Archives which unquestion- ably verifies the existence of an \"MJ12\" group in 1954 and definitely links both the National Security Council and the President of the Unites States to it.

A aimllar analysis of the four dead occupanta waa arranged by Dr. Bronk.

Mars was and remains a possibility, although some scientists, most notably Dr. Menzel, consider It more likely that we are dealing with beings from another solar system entirely. numerous examples of what appear to be a form of writing were found In the wreckage. Efforts to decipher these have remained largely unsuccessful. (See Attachment \"E\".) Squally unsuccessful hare been efforts to determine the method of propulsion or the nature.or method of transmission of the power source involved. Research along these lines has been complicated by the complete absence of identifiable wings, propellers, jets, or other conventional tsethods of propulsion and guidance, as well as a total luck of net-ill le wiring, vacuum tubes, or similar recognizable -lectronic componento.

Implications for the National Security are of continuing im- portance in that the motives and ultimate Intentions of these visitors remain completely unknown.

Officers at the base say the \"disc\" was flown in a Super-Fortress to \"higher head- quarters\" undisclosed. The intelligence office reported that it gained possession of the \"disc\" through the co-operation of a Roswell rancher and George Wilson, sheriff at Roswell. The disc landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher, whose name has not yet been obtained, stored the disc until such time as he was able to reach the Roswell sheriffs office. The air base refused to give details of construction of the disc or its appearance. Residents near the ranch on which the disc was found reported seeing a;strange blue light several days ago about 3 a.m. * * * THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - July 1952: Since the first of the month UFO activity, was increasing across the. country. On the 20th they converged on Washington, DC. At midnight eight air traffic controllers, headed by Senior Controller Harry G. Barnes started their work shift in the radar room at the Air Traffic Control Center at Washington National Airport. At exactly 12:40 AM seven sharp blips suddenly appeared on the main radar scope. The airport control tower showed the same blips in the same location. One controller was observing one from the same tower at the same time. The scope at Andrews Field — across the Potomac River in Maryland — showed the objects in the same 16 location. The UFOs were moving in restricted air space — over the White House and near the Capitol building. On the Center scope one UFO was seen making a 90-degree turn. Another object moving at high speed suddenly reversed course.\" One of the objects streaking across an ASR scope at the National Airport tower had been tracked at 7200 M.P.H. At 3 AM as two Air Force jets approached Washington, D.C. all of the UFOs vanished from the radar screens at all three tracking facilities. As daylight began to show a radio engineer observed five huge discs circling in loose formation over the Capitol, then tilted upward and vanished in a few seconds. The five- hour survey over Washington, DC had ended. Harry Barnes summed up the events of the morning of the 20th in the Washington Daily News: \"There is no other conclusion I can reach but that for six hours on the morning of the 20th of July there were at least ten unidentifiable objects moving above Washington. They were not ordinary aircraft. I could tell, that by their movement on the scope. I can safely deduce that they performed gyrations which no known aircraft could perform. By this I mean that our scope showed that they could make right angle turns and complete reversals of flight. Nor in my opinion could any natural phenomena account for these spots on our radar.\" About 10:30 PM on July 26th, the same radar operators at the Air Traffic Control Center who had seen the UFOs the week before watched more of the unknowns on their scope. Controllers at the National Airport tower and the radar station at Andrews Air Force Base also were watching the objects on their scopes. Once again a call went out for jet interceptors. But just.as the two F-94's arrived in the area the UFOs disappeared from all of the scopes. A few minutes after the F-94's left the Washington area, the unidentified targets were back on the radar scopes in that same area. Once more two F-94's roared south toward Washington. This time the targets stayed on the radar scopes until the jets arrived. The controllers vectored the jets toward group after group of targets, but each time, before the jets could get close enough to see anything more than just a light, the targets had sped away. On the 29th the UFOs returned to Washington. .The Civil Aeronautics Administration traffic control center reported that its radar picked up the objects for about six straight hours. The CAA radar first started picking up the strange blips about 1:30 AM and they continued roaming the radar scope until 6 AM. There were as many as eight to 12 of the objects on the scope at the same time. * * * THIRTY YEARS AGO - July 1957: Fifteen-year-old Jack Stephens of Gait, Ontario, Canada said he saw a UFO land in a field within 300 yards of him on the 30th. \"I'm not sure if it was the noise or if I first saw the light, but I looked up, past the trees, and saw a kind of bright light. It was moving quickly. First I figured it was a plane. Then I saw it was circular and it made a queer, singing kind of hum. The machine dipped across one of the small lakes. Then it paused above the gully about 300 yards from me. The top was bright and it didn't revojve but the round body was spinning very fast. As I watched it dropped like a helicopter. I saw light around it, but as the speed lessened they became sort of portholes. As it came down there was no flame, but I could see a red flame out the bottom of it as it hovered about two feet above the ground. It looked big as a house but I guess it was 30 or 35 feet wide and 10 or 12 feet high. It just climbed away without a sound.\" At the scene investigators found a burned circle, two three-toed prints, eight patches which appeared to have been burned, and a number of small trees and limbs that had been snapped off. prints were 10 inches wide at the toes, and about 18 inches long.

A UFO approached their installation and began circling around it. The engineer that reported the incident said the object circled just like a Piper Cub airplane would. This was in broad daylight, and apparently the UFO was observing the radar station. It was a double-sided disc like two bowls put together rim-to-rim, and it was a silver coin color. There were no windows or anything else visible. It was about 50 feet in diameter, and was only a few hundred feet away — very close. One engineer grabbed his 35mm movie camera — he had been taking pictures of missile launches — and started shooting. He shot 90 feet of color film. Two days later the Air Force came to the installation and confiscated the film. * * * TWENTY YEARS AGO — July 1967: Mrs. Emma Funk was traveling near Millerton, NY on the 17th when her car was temporarily stalled when hit by a UFO at 11:25 PM. Under hypnosis she reported that as she was turning off her car's radio which was filled with static, a black object the size of a bowling ball with a blue corona came over the car's hood straight for her face. The object cracked her windshield and she saw it veer off to the right as the car stalled just before she passed out. Fifteen minutes later, Mrs. Funk reported that she was driving in the opposite direction on Rt. 22. Under hypnosis she said \"they\" turned her car around and struck her across the chest with a rod. Although she could not tell who \"they\" were, her doctor treated her for a chest bruise after the encounter. On the 30th, Sidney Zipkin, 50- year-old guard at a park in Churchville, NY, was making his rounds when he saw a UFO sitting on the ground in a parking lot. It was about 50 feet long, round in the center with extended sides that gave it the shape of a fat cigar. He could not make out a color but he saw green lights on the bottom. He stopped his truck about 100 feet away, training the headlights on the craft. As he gaped in disbelief, two midget-like men, dressed in shiny, black uniforms, ran past the truck and boarded the object. Within a minute it ascended vertically until the green lights disappeared into the black sky. Investigators said they found two witnesses who semi- corroborated Zipkin's story. About four hours after Zipkin's report was filed with the sheriff's department, a second UFO passed over Churchville. Its flight was confirmed by over 30 witnesses. * * * FIFTEEN YEARS AGO — July 1972: No significant reports on file for this period. * * * TEN YEARS AGO - July 1977: Molly Smith (not her real name) had never seen a UFO movie or read their books and magazines. She was on her way to Hulbert, MI at 4:50 on a hot, dry afternoon, (exact date unknown). She slowed the car to 15 MPH as she rounded the curve on a desolate stretch. Halfway into the curve, she saw someone standing on the right side, about a foot into the road from the 3- foot-high embankment: She described him as about 5-feet-5, slender, with normal body structure, and large almond-shaped eyes slanted tight against the side of his head. He wore a one-piece, metallic dark green suit. As the car pulled alongside, it slid out of control. Mrs. Smith recalls the sound of static electricity, and she pulled her hands off the steering wheel. The car hit the embankment, went into a 12-foot slide and was lifted into the air. With one sweep, it landed 10 feet into the woods to the left of the road, perched on a 4-foot-high pile of logs, encircled on three sides by trees. As the car struck the logs, she felt the jar and bit her tongue. Mrs.Smith turned and looked out the rear window. The man had moved up the road and stood directly behind her car. She felt disoriented, but without fear, except for the hissing in the car. Laying her head on the steering wheel, the mother of four thought of her children at home. When she looked up again, the man was gone. The woman grabbed her keys and purse, leaped from the car with difficulty, and ran 2% miles home. Her electric watch stopped at 4:50 PM. When she and her husband rounded up help to go for the car, they found no skid marks and no scratches on the trees. They found only a car wedged on top of the logs, her first footprints sprinting 12 feet from the car, spaced at 6-foot intervals until she rounded the curve. Then they found the footprints where she said she saw the man. Eight people saw the tracks. They described them as. being like horse-hoofs, only with heels, spaced close together with the toes dug three- quarters of an inch into the hard- packed gravel road. Hunters in the group agreed they were not animal tracks. The tracks led out of the woods, down the embankment to where she says she first spotted the man, back and forth behind the car, and disappeared again up the embankment. Smith called heavy equipment operator Jimmy Clay and Joe Durga to remove the car. Clay brought his front end loader, and Durga worked with a winch. The car wouldn't budge. They finally cut the logs out with a chain saw and dragged the car back to the road. It showed no damage except a minor scratch from a twig. The oil pan and transmission were intact, and Mrs. Smith drove the car home. People who saw the car in the woods don't talk about it much. They said little the day they worked getting it out. It was eerie, the quiet. But if you ask them, they tell it. Like Jimmy Clay. The tracks were there, he says. \"Somehow, the car cleared the embankment, but she couldn't have been going fast enough to put it on top of the logs.\" One of the men shakes his head: \"That lady didn't get that car in those trees by herself unless she picked it up and put it there.\" Following Mrs. Smith's experience, she and her family had several UFO experiences. 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"\"ABDUCTIONS\" AND CREDIBILITY By Robert Wanderer Robert Wanderer is a MUFON specialist in communications who seeks a middle ground between \"believers\" and \"debunkers.\" We're at a UFO symposium, and we've just heard a panel of four \"abductees.\" The man sitting next to me, a long time UFO investigator, turns and observes, \"I wish they'd abduct someone credible for a change!\" Mind you, this man is convinced that extra-terrestrial spaceships are visiting the earth, and that \"aliens\" on board are \"abducting\" people. But even such a \"hard-core believer\" is becoming uncomfortable with the continuing questionable quality of the \"abduction\" evidence. He and the general public will find no solace for their doubts in the year's two new major studies. Whitley Strieber,\" who describes his \"abduction\" in Communion, is a writer who until 1983 penned \"imaginative thrillers\" but has since turned to \"more serious fiction\"; one immediately wonders if his \"imaginative\" abilities haven't resurfaced. Budd Hopkins, the major researcher in the \"abduction\" field, worked with Strieber as he attempted to come to grips with his experience, and also wrote Intruders, on his research into a series of \"abductions\" in an Indiana suburb. Both Strieber on the very first page and Hopkins near the end of the book raise the key question: Are these \"abduction\" experiences \"real,\" or are they what Hopkins calls \"some new and heretofore unrecognized and nearly universal psychological phenomenon?\" Both writers seem absolutely convinced that their stories are \"real,\" and the material they present is designed to support that contention. The reader looking for a more credible point of view must ferret out clues here and there which lend some support to a \"psychological\" explanation. 18 EXPERIENCES Strieber tells of a \"dramatic personality change\" which resulted in he and his wife going \"through personal hell because of my demands and accusatory behavior\" (p.31). He describes his sudden adverse reaction to a house they were considering buying some years earlier and cities it as \"frightening\" because of his \"clear awareness that this was a paranoid fantasy\" (p.50). In his hypnosis he worried about \"the possibility that I was unconsciously eager to comply with an outcome I might secretly have longed for. I might want powerful visitors to appear\" (p.56). He writes of his \"distressed state\" over the past year in which he repeatedly went through the house in the middle of the night, \"opening closets and looking under beds\" (p. 101). He says he was \"terrified\" as a little boy by an appearance of Mr. Peanut which \"never happened,\" and how he \"told for years\" of being present at the University of Texas during Charles Whitman's shooting spree from the tower in 1966, \"but I wasn't there\" (p. 121). He describes the \"terror\" of how he woke from sleep one night to find \"small people\" lined up beside his bed, but at great effort he managed to smile, the small people, \"dashed away with a whoosh,\" and he immediately \"plunged\" back into sleep (p.174). \"Kathie,\" the chief protagonist of Hopkins' book, \"has had a long struggle with several chronic, possible psychosomatic illnesses — colitis, irregular heartbeat, acute anxiety, insomnia and so forth.\" When she was in group therapy her psychologist suspected \"some as yet undiscovered cause for her problems, such as a buried trauma, a particular unremembered event\" (p.20). She had suffered \"just about every medical anomaly\" Hopkins had ever heard of. She was overweight from a hormonal imbalance, at seven she began regular menstruation, at ten she had grown to her adult height and was being treated for high blood pressure, at fourteen she was operated on for gallstones and her gallbladder was removed — well, the list goes on a great length (p.54-55). No specific single problem here would rule Kathie as \"not credible,\" but the sheer volume of psychological and medical ailments leaves one dubious. The \"buried trauma\" listed by her psychologist would strike me as a possible basic experience leading to the creation of an \"abduction\" story many years later; however, Hopkins employs a curious circular reasoning that in this case would suggest the early trauma was a previous \"abduction\" as a small child. A deeper question of credibility might be raised about Hopkins himself; or, to be more specific, there seems to be a vast difference between his way of assessing probabilities and \"creating reality\" and that which strikes me as the more common and rational way. Take, for example, the story of \"Nan\" (p.98), described as \"Kathie's best friend.\" BIZARRE REPORT Nan went out to her kitchen one evening, and during the few seconds before the fluorescent light came on she was \"terrified\" to see a tall figure staring at her through the window a few feet away. When the light came on she could no longer \"see\" the man. And (1) \\ their beagle, \"which notoriously barked at any sound or movement,\" remained quiet, (2) their backyard was completely fenced in with high mesh broken only by two squeaking gates, and apparently no squeaking was heard, (3) \"there was fresh snow on the ground, but no sign of either the intruder or any footprints,\" and (4) the ."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ABDUCTIONS, Continued angle from which she \"saw\" the figure would require him to be either eight feet tall or floating a few feet off the ground. Hopkins says \"one does not know what to make of a bizarre report such as this.\" I would judge it a 99% probability of a misperception, but Hopkins only reluctantly considers that even as a possibility, to \"suppose\" that \"Nan's eyes could have played tricks on her, as they say.\" He adds later (p. 106) that \"with the staring figure in her backyard, Nan also seems to have her own personal involvement with the (abduction) phenomenon.\" What is the reader to make of an investigator who takes what appears to be Nan's two- second misperception and turns it into full-blown proof of her \"involvement\" with \"abductions\"? . One point these books certainly make clear, if the previous cases haven't convinced you, is that \"abduction\" people experience their hypnotically-induced stories as \"true.\" They are not suffering a major known psychological problem, they are not hallucinating, they are not faking it. It boils down to two possibilities: (1) their stories are \"objectively true,\" or (2). there is some factor in their background that causes them to go into something like an altered state of consciousness under hypnosis in which they create their \"abduction\" story and sincerely believe it to be true. It seems to me the evidence points clearly toward the second alternative, particularly because of the continuing lack of acceptable independent corroboration of any of these \"abduction\" stories. Another point that is becoming increasingly clear from these books and previous accounts is the poverty of the continuing attempt to find some physical correlation that would help support the \"reality\" hypothesis. Once again we hear of lights in the sky and UFOs seen, but nothing that I can find to show that these sightings are more than coincidental. Hopkins pushes his theory that unexplained scars on one's body came from previous \"abductions\" where the \"aliens\" were taking cell samples or whatever. But Hopkins (continued on page 15) THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant AUGUST 1987 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter, in Pisces, rises in the east about 10:30 PM daylight time in mid-Augus! and an hour earlier by month's end. This bright giant of the solar system shines at magnitude -2.7. It begins retrograde or westward motion on the 20th. Saturn, in Ophiuchus, is in the south at dusk, moves into the SW when twiligr' ends, and sets in the WSW about 12:45 AM in midmonth. The second larger. planet resumes direct or eastward motion on the 19th: Its magnitude 15+0.4. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter is high in the south at dawn. Meteor Showers: The period from late July to mid-August is the most fruitful time of the year fo\" meteor-watching. Two meteor showers range across the night sky, the DelU; Aquarids and the Perseids. In early August the Perseids are building to a peak on the morning of the 12th, while the Aquarids appear in decreasing number? until midmonth (their maximum occurred July 29). Ordinarily on the 12th an observer might see about one Perseid per minute toward dawn. This year, however, bright moonlight will severely hamper viewing. Most swift meteors coming from the north will be Perseids; slower ones from the south are Aquarids. Moon Phases: First quarter-August 2 Full moon-August 9 Last quarter-August 16 New moon-August 24 First quarter-August 31 The Stars: € O € August evenings bring the Summer Triangle high overhead. Not actually e constellation itself, the triangle instead in composed of the brightest stars o three separate constellations. The most brilliant of the three stars, Vega, lies in the constellation of Lyra the Harp, basically a crooked rectangle of lesser stars. This is the magical harr given to Orpheus by his father Apollo. The instrument's music was said tc enchant even the beasts of the forest. East of Vega is Deneb, which marks the tail of the flying Swan Cygnus. The \"pattern is often nicknamed the Northern Cross, with Deneb at the top of tht cross. Albireo, the foot of the cross, is a beautiful blue-gold double star in a. small telescope. Below Cygnus we find Altair, the third star in the triangle. It marks the head of Aquila the Eagle. This is the bird that carried Jupiter's thunderbolts. Both the Eagle and the Swan are flying in opposite directions along the Milky Way. This cross-sectional view of our star city home, a spiral galaxy, splits the sky overhead from north to south. Try to escape the streetlights of your city or town and admire the dim and delicate splendor of the Milky Way from a dark vantage point.    j"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus The MUFON Eighteenth Annual UFO Symposium, hosted by the Fund for UFO Research and held on June 26, 27, and 28 at The American University in Washington, D.C., exceeded all expectations. As the theme implied \"International Symposium on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena: 1947 — 1987,\" or subtitled \"Forty Years is Long Enough,\" speakers from every continent of the World appeared. World press was thoroughly exposed to the symposium due to its location and the agenda of international speakers. Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Chairman, and his symposium Committee must be commended for conducting the finest and most impressive UFO symposium in the forty year history of the phenomenon. An additional feature of this year's symposium included short papers contributed by participating attendees as well as the regular workshops and panel discussions. The MUFON 1987 International UFO Symposium Proceedings are available from MUFON for $15 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. It contains all of the papers delivered by the featured speakers that were received for publication by June 1,1987 when the proceedings went to press (222 pages). The 1987 Proceedings are respectfully dedicated to Ted Bloecher for his outstanding contribution to UFOlogy since the early 1950s. The MUFON AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING WORK IN THE UFO FIELD FOR 1986 - 1987 plaque was awarded to Raymond E. Fowler in absentia, by his colleagues in UFOlogy. The Fund for UFO Research presented a cash award in the name of Isabel Davis (a co-founder of the Fund) to Mr. Fowler in recognition of his accomplishments. * * * Since Stanton Friedman did not submit his symposium paper titled \"The Canadian UFO Scene\" in adequate time to be published in the 1987 proceedings, it will be published in a future issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. Bill Chalker's paper was mailed in two segments (Australia). The first part was published in the proceedings, whereas the second part titled, \"History of UFO Involvement of Official Government Organizations\" is being considered for the Journal, also. Mr. Chalker presented the government involvement in this speech in Washington, D.C. * * * On June 20, 1987 at 12:30 pm CDST, Paul Harvey, noted radio and TV commentator, devoted his entire program to the status of current UFOlogy and announced the dates and place for the MUFON 1987 International UFO Symposium in Washington, D.C. Marking the 40th anniversary of Kenneth Arnold's UFO sighting in Washington State, Ted Koppel, host for ABC-TV's \"Night Line,\" planned his entire program on June 24th on UFOs and provided additional publicity for the symposium. Even though the 1987 symposium has just concluded, we are soliciting bids for the MUFON 1988 UFO Symposium. A written inquiry has been received for the Chicago area from Thomas P. Stults and William Leone, State Section Director. Chicago would be an ideal central location for such an event. Mr. Ulf Ekstedt of UFO-Sweden in Eskilstuna has accepted the position of MUFON's Representative for Sweden. He is the cashier and chief investigator for UFO-Sweden, member of the board of Project URD, and member of the Project Coordinating Committee for Project Hessdalen. In addition to these credentials, he comes highly recommended by Philip Mantle, Representative for England. Jeffrey R. Neal, Major U.S.A.F., former State Section Director for Clark County and Acting State Director for Nevada, is being transferred to Germany in August. John Lear, an airline captain living in Las Vegas, became the new State Section Director for Clark County on May 26th. As a note of his accomplishments as a flyer, Mr. Lear is the only pilot to hold every pilot certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Larry G. Lemke, an aerospace engineer in Sunnyvale, Calif, has volunteered to serve as a Research Specialist. He has a Masters Degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics (1978) and a B.S. in Physics (1976). Paul C. Cerny, Western Regional Director has appointed Franklin A. Youri to the position of State Section Director for Merced and Stanislaus Counties in California. * * * In order to better serve the membership of MUFON and to modernize the headquarters office, a computer, display monitor, printer, modem, associated equipment and software has been purchased. Some of the first applications will be adhesive address labels on the cover of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL and current state membership lists. The word processor and printer will be used for multiple copy letters whenever it is superior to xerox copies. The increase in the membership dues structure in February 1986 has enabled MUFON to make this purchase."}]
