Wait a minute, you say, a) what is the World Wide Web, and b) what is a home page? We're glad you asked. The Web, in shorthand, is a component of the global Internet, or Net for short, a worldwide connection of various computer servers, each with any number of sites accessible by modem. The server site of an individual, university, commercial or other organization is known as a home page. To reach a particular home page, you direct a software program known as a Web browser to that site's specific URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, address. Wait another minute, you say. You're supposed to be making things simple, and already you're throwing more unknown terms at me. You're right. All you really need to know is that the major commercial online ser- vices like CompuServe and America On Line have al- ready made the Net and Web available to their members. If you prefer, you can sign up with a local provider who will connect you to the Net and provide all the software (PC or Mac) you need, a bundle which typi- cally includes a Web browser, a dial-up program, a newsgroup reader, and an E-mail program, usually a version of something called Eudora, which allows you to send and receive electronic mail. Local providers typi- cally charge anywhere from between $9.95 to $19.95 a month, depending on the number of hours you expect to actually be connected, or on line. The higher rate usually allows unlimited access time and includes the cost of your own Web home page, should you decide to create one, in the bargain. Of course you'll need a computer and modem — the faster the better — to get this far. Once everything is in place, simply open up your Web browser. (Netscape Navigator is the most popular one, but there are many others under different names.) Now type in the follow- ing address (usually under a Go To option): http://www.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/MUFON. This should take you to the MUFON home page. The first thing you'll see is a graphic logo for MUFON — created by Vince Johnson — followed by a green counter, which looks much like an automobile's odome- ter, or mileage indicator. It simply tells you how many people have been here before you, and is a way for us to keep count of incoming traffic. Next, you will notice a list of options, in our case the following: • An Introduction to Ufology. • More about MUFQN. How to contact MUFON. An application form to join MUFON. Excerpts from the latest MUFON UFO Journal on-line. Archive of past issues of the MUFON UFO Journal. Excerpts from the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. What to do if you see a UFO.

Clicking on the highlighted, or underlined, area of \"What to do if you see a UFO\" gains the viewer access to the UFO sighting report Form 1 found on pages 58-9 of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual (4th Edition). Selecting \"How to order publications from MUFON\" brings up a list of an- nual symposium proceedings which are still available, along with their individual contents, plus a list of other publications and videos available from MUFON. People new to MUFON can choose \"An application form to join MUFON,\" which brings up an application form that can be printed out, filled in and mailed to MU- FON. Many of the other options are self-explanatory.

For another, it's Net etiquette: link to other sites and they'll link to you. At the same time, MUFON obviously has no input or control over the material that appears on other UFO Web sites. In short, while we provide the address(es) of other Web sites, the information thereon isn't necessarily endorsed by MU- FON or its Board of Directors.

RAINING ON SAGAN'S PARADE by Dr. Bruce Maccabee D r. Carl Sagan has written yet another article in Parade Magazine (Dec. 3, 1995) regarding UFO sightings and aliens. \"What's the evidence,\" he asks. \"On so important a question as UFOs, the evidence must be airtight. People make mistakes. People play practical jokes. People stretch the truth for money, at- tention or fame. People occasionally misunderstand what they're seeing. And sometimes even see things that aren't there.\" According to Dr. Sagan, there is no convincing evidence that UFOs are real. Methinks Carl doth protest too much for a person who, as a young man, was at least favorable toward, if not totally convinced by, the early UFO sightings: \"It seemed pretty believable to me ... apart from a few har- rumphs and giggles — I couldn't find any counterargu- ments. How could all these eyewitnesses be mistaken?\" After all, he is a proponent of listening via radio to the universe in order to detect signs of intelligent life \"out there.\" Hence he must be a believer in life out there ... enough of a believer to commit his and other people's time and money to hours and hours of \"listening.\" Is there any evidence of life out there to listen for? Only probabilistic arguments based on the existence of intel- ligent life here. There are no observational data. This is in stark contrast to the situation regarding UFO sightings for which there is a lot of observational data, whether or not Dr. Sagan considers it \"airtight.\" Dr. Sagan points out that as he grew up and learned \"how science works — the secrets of its great success,\" he became skeptical of UFO reports. He decided that \"Essentially all the UFO cases were anecdotes,\" just stories, by people \"who reported what they saw.\" Some saw \"natural — if unfamiliar phenomena ... unconven- tional aircraft... conventional aircraft with unusual light- ing patterns; high altitude balloons; luminescent insects; planets seen under unusual atmospheric conditions; op- tical mirages and loomings; lenticular clouds; ball light- ning; sun dogs; meteors, including green fireballs; and artificial satellites, nose cones and rocket boosters spec- tacularly reentering the atmosphere.\" He also points out that \"the field attracted rogues and charlatans,\" that \"many UFO photos turned out to be fakes\" and at least in one case a mass UFO sighting was of a hot air balloon with candles. In other words, in Dr. Sagan's opinion, be- cause some or many UFO sightings can be explained as he has suggested, then all UFO sightings can be ex- plained as he has suggested and hence there is no \"air- tight\" evidence. At the end of his article (in which he also discussed crop circles, which I do not discuss here because they may not be related to UFO sightings) he appeals to skepticism as a counter to credulity and laments that the \"tools of skepticism are generally unavailable to the citizens of our society.\" The implication is that anyone who \"believes\" in UFO reality is not being properly skeptical but, rather, credulous (willing to believe in \"anything\"). Again methinks that Carl protests too much PAGE 4 NUMBER 333 JANUARY 1996"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL for it was by using the \"tools of skepticism\" that I ar- rived at the conclusion that UFOs are real. My \"conversion\" to \"belief (really, acceptance) of UFO reality was a result of considering and analyzing explanations for UFO sightings. 1 analyzed a number of the classic (read, \"older\") sightings and the explana- tions for them and realized that the explanations were unconvincing, at best, and just plain wrong, at worst. It was at this time that I became skeptical of the skeptics. I also discovered that some of the more vocal skeptics act as if they have a desire to disbelieve, and some go so far as to become \"debunkers\" who discount UFO sight- ings without so much as a sideways glance at them. Sometimes these debunkers disparage or make fun of people who report such sightings. Consider, for example. Dr. Sagan's suggestion that some sightings were actually of high altitude balloons (see above). Is he aware that some of the earliest flying saucer/UFO sightings were made in clear daylight by the scientists who launched those balloons? Is he aware that these scientists saw their own balloons and strange, circular shiny objects flying past or around the bal- loons? These men were trained observers of things in the sky, not to be tricked by any of the natural or manmade phenomena regarded by Sagan as \"the\" solutions to UFO sightings. So what if \"many UFO photos\" turned out to be fakes; not all are. Does Dr. Sagan know about the cinetheodolite films shot on April 27, 1950 by techni- cians at the White Sand Proving Ground? According to mathematician Wilber Mitchell, triangulation showed that the objects were traveling at a high rate of speed over the Holloman Range at an altitude of about 150,000 ft. The objects were about 30 feet in diameter. Several films of unidentified objects flying over White Sands were taken in the late spring of 1950. So what if many sightings could be explained by natural phenomena, as Dr. Sagan suggested. There are also many which can't, such as the first widely reported sighting, that of Kenneth Arnold on June 24, 1947. Many people have tried to explain Arnold's sighting; none has succeeded. The late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, as- tronomer and consultant to the Air Force Project Blue Book, was initially a severe skeptic of flying saucer re- ports. He was the first scientist to analyze Arnold's re- port to the (Army) Air Force and attempt to explain it, in 1948. By 25 years later he had reversed his opinion about UFO reports and realized that he hadn't explained Arnold's sighting. In November 1986, the Japanese pilot and two man crew of a jumbo jet freighter flying over Alaska wit- nessed a series of sighting events, including radar de- tections, which was investigated by the Federal Aeronautics Administration. In March 1987, the FAA re- leased a package of information on the sighting to the public and announced its \"solution\": the ground radar had been fooled by malfunctions that occurred just as the JANUARY 1996    NUMBER 333 crew was reporting objects/lights near the aircraft. The FAA had \"no comment\" on the visual sighting and no comment about the object detected on the airplane radar. The Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP) publicized its explanation for the sighting — misidentifications of Mars and Jupiter — before the FAA released its reports. A month or so later, when it became apparent from the FAA-released information that the visual sighting direction was not in the direction of these planets the skeptics revised their explanation to moonlight reflected from clouds. Neither explanation was satisfactory in view of the descriptions given by the three witnesses on the plane. Try as he may, Dr. Sagan cannot get away from the fact that UFO sightings have been reported under \"unim- peachable\" conditions, including multiple witness day- light sightings of structured objects (seen well enough so that identification would be immediately obvious if it were possible), multiple radar/visual sightings, multiple witnessed photographic and video sightings and sight- ings that involved landing traces (several thousand of these on record). It is true that we, the civilian commu- nity of UFO investigators, do not have something which we are positive is a piece of a flying saucer. However, there is a mass of circumstantial evidence of the type which, if this were to be tried in a court of law, would be sufficient to prove the case. If Dr. Sagan wishes to ignore all this, that is his choice. He can go back to listening for aliens. But he should leave the ufologists alone. We have enough in- born healthy skepticism to keep us from being overly credulous, while not throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Furthermore, contrary to Dr. Sagan's stated opinion that we might \"have a vested interest in dis- couraging skepticism,\" we encourage skepticism on both sides of this issue.

On November 28, ABC news reported that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and other security agencies spent as much as $20 million over the past 25 years on projects in which they used psychics on various top se- cret military projects. The psychics, called \"remote viewers,\" are able to perceive and describe remote data through the use of their mental powers. The revelation was made as a result of a Congressional inquiry into the value of continuing the expenditure of tax money on a phenomenon that many scientists scoff at as being nonexistent. ABC news, which received a copy of the report, revealed that psy- chics had been used on numerous occasions to \"see\" events occurring in other parts of the world. Among these projects were the location of Iranian embassy hostages during the Iran crisis, the location of under- ground nuclear testing facilities in Russia, the tracking of Soviet submarines and finding Moammar Gadhafi prior to our bombing Libya. Ted Koppel, on the TV program \"Nightline,\" inter- viewed former CIA chief Robert Gates, psychic Joe McMoneagle, physicist Edwin May (one of the project directors), DIA project director Dale Graft, and a con- sultant to the Pentagon identified only as \"Norm.\" Although the report concludes that no further use of psychics for defense purposes is warranted, psychic Joe McMoneagle made it clear that the projects had spec- tacular successes in many cases. Gates, Graft and May, however, minimized the value of the program, claiming that only 12 out of 500 cases produced accurate results. All three agreed that the program was of little use to the military and that such experiments were \"better ex- plored in an academic setting.\" Interestingly, one of those who helped prepare the study was Ray Hyman, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon. Hyman is a member of the exec- utive council of CSICOP, an organization dedicated to debunking the paranormal. Although he remained skep- tical, his co-author Jessica Utts, a professor at the University of California-Davis, said the psychics were accurate 15 percent of the time. These revelations confirm what Blum reported in his 1990 book, Out There: The Government's Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials. Blum uncovered evidence of the Pentagon's use of remote viewers for a top secret pro- gram called Project Aquarius, conducted by the DIA's Directorate for Management and Operations. This pro- ject was conducted right next door to the White House in the old Executive Office Building, in the Fall of 1985. The initial meeting that started the project was held in the office of George Keyworth, President Reagan's Science Adviser, and included staff of the Office of Science and Technology. The meeting was conducted by two scientists from the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). The demonstration consisted of having a psychic fo- cus his powers on specific longitudinal and latitudinal in- formation and asking him to see what was there. The an- swer, which he gave correctly: a mansion. As it turns out, the mansion belonged to Mikhail Gorbachev. The next phase of the demonstration was conducted by a Naval Commander, presumably from the Office of Naval Intelligence. He showed the psychic a group of about six photographs of Russian and American sub- marines, some armed with nuclear warheads, and asked the viewer to give him the whereabouts of each of the submarines by stating the specific coordinates of each site. The Commander had in his briefcase a list of the current actual locations of each craft. The viewer then went into a trance, his head gently bobbing up and down. Then he began announcing the locations of the ships: off the coast of South Carolina, off the northern coast of Iceland, etc. But when he got to the photograph of a Soviet Delta Class submarine, he stum- bled, \"his face suddenly became twisted with the sur- prised look of someone who had just encountered a small, but unexpected trouble in his path ... His trance broke ... and he was clearly uncomfortable. No, one of the witnesses decided: he was scared.\" \"What is it?\" he was asked. The viewer explained that he had seen something else at the same coordinates, which were off the coast of Nova Scotia. It was \"hov- ering above the submarine.\" The scientist asked the viewer to draw what he saw. Blum reports that \"It was the drawing of a wingless aircraft. To many in the room the drawing was quite familiar. 'A rocket?' the scientist prodded.\" PAGE 6 NUMBER 333 Continued on Page 15 JANUARY 1996"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Examining MUFON's Computerized UFO Data Section 2: Sightings by Year, Month, Day, Time, and Duration By T. David Spencer, Deputy Director, Investigations T his is the second of an eight-section report on the database. The CE, MA, FB. and AN types referenced in this section were discussed in the first section. The types are also described in the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, fourth edition, Section XVIII, Part 1, starting on page 210. SIGHTINGS BY YEAR Since the number of cases is critically dependent on submissions of completed reports by volunteer Field Investigators, the computerized MUFON UFO data- base may not be the best to measure the frequencies of UFO events by year. There should be some relationship between the number of submissions and the amount of observed UFO-related events, but it would surely vary from year to year. There are more reports during 1989 (125 sightings) than any other year (Chart 2-1). Thirty nine of the 1989 sightings were in Florida and were associated with the Gulf Breeze area, but even if the Florida cases were ignored, there would still be more reports in the database for 1989. There appears to be nothing extraordinary re- garding the sightings that year other than the Gulf Breeze phenomena. SIGHTING MONTHS Within the contiguous (48) United States, 539 reports identify the month of the event. These include 81 prior to 1985, 212 in the years 1985-1989, and 246 from 1990 through 1994, distributed as shown in Chart 2-2. By separating the CEs and distant sightings, a different picture is painted (Chart 2-3). There is a distinct peak of distant sightings during October, with secondary peaks in July, August, and September. The CEs do not show a distinct peak month and are fairly uniformly distrib- uted, slightly higher between July and December. Sightings by Year Ranges Referring back to Chart 2-2, the data of events before 1985 show most sightings per month occurring between May and November. The 1985-1989 data indicate that the last six months of the year exhibited the highest frequency of sightings, with peaks in October and December. In the 1990-1994 data, the greatest sighting frequencies occurred during four months - July, August, September, and October, with no significant peak month. For CEs, all months after June have had about the same numbers of sightings (Chart 2-3), but this period JANUARY 1996    NUMBER 333 covers only 59 percent of the total. It has been almost as likely to have a close encounter during the first half of the year as the last half. Sightings vs. Meteor Showers Despite our efforts to assure a sighting report is not of an IFO, the meteor showers in July and August (Aquarids and Perseids) and October (Draconids and Orionids) may have contributed to the number of sightings. In the milder climates of Summer and Fall, more people are likely to be outside at night. Table 2-1. Sightings During Meteor Shower Time Periods (281 distant and 205 CE sightings specified days.)

Sightings during periods of meteor shower activ- ity — not necessarily due to the meteors — have repre- sented only 10 percent of all sightings (9 percent of distant and 11 percent of CEs). Enough events occurred during meteor shower peri- ods to suspect that some sightings must be a result of meteors, but the percentage (10 percent) has little sig- nificance. DAY OF THE WEEK Historically, event data has indicated that more sightings occur in the middle of the week than any other time, and PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL this report supports that observation. From Table 2-2, 50 percent of the sightings occurred Tuesday through Thursday, peaking at 20 percent on Wednesday. For the periods 1985-1989 (191 events) and 1990-1994 (239 events), the percentage in each of the middle three days differed by no more than 1 percent from the total, for both CEs and distant sightings. Further analysis identifies two exceptions: 1. The MA type had 23 percent, not 19-21 percent, on Wednesday. 2. The AN type had a peak of 25 percent on Friday, not Wednesday. Table 2-2.

This possibility is studied in the analyses of locations (Section 3) and sky conditions (part of Section 4). Why did peak numbers of sightings happen on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays? Appropriate demographics would probably provide an answer, since there is no known reason to expect UFOs to have any in- terest in our designation of the week or days of the week. Nonetheless, the statistic is a curious one. TIMES OF THE DAY Chart 2-4 depicts the events by time of day for each of the three year intervals and the total. The hours are shown starting at noon in order to display the peak dis- tribution near the center. A total of 582 events con- tribute to this chart, 96 before 1985, 225 between 1985 and 1989, and 261 between 1990 and 1994. Peak Times for Sightings There are variations, but the time intervals and the total agree that the peak numbers of events occurred between 1800 hours (6:00 p.m.) and 2400 hours (midnight), the maximum during 2100 hours (9:00 p.m.). This five hour time period includes 61 percent of all data. Greenwich Mean Time The data in Chart 2-4 is based on local times for the sightings, including Standard and Daylight Savings times. In an effort to reduce the mystery of peaks, the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) for each sighting was used for a comparison. If sightings were geographically evenly distributed, normalizing the times (getting time- zone independent values) should make the distribution more uniform. A more pronounced peak in the GMT distribution would suggest that sightings were indepen- dent of local times. As illustrated in Chart 2-5, there is some broadening of the peak's shoulders. Primarily, the single peak is replaced by two, indicating that a significant percentage of cases occurred in two neighboring time zones, a find- ing which is studied in Section 3 (location). The GMT peak is less pronounced than the local time peak, suggesting that the \"2100 hours\" phenome- non was a social demographic (associated with the habits of people). Time by Month From 558 events that include both month and time, all months exhibit the maximum number of sightings be- tween 1800 and 2400 hours, but there is a difference be- tween the six months starting April and that starting October. As depicted in Table 2-3*, the peak period for sightings during the six months starting April began at 2000 hours and ended at 2400 hours, and the 2200- 2400 hours period has had an average of 24 percent of the sightings. For every months over the next six months, the percentage of sightings during the 2200 - 2359 hours period dropped to 16 percent, while the av- erage percentage in the 1800 - 1959 hours period in- creased from 6 to 23 percent (350% increase in the number of sightings). * Note: Although Table 2-3 reduces the data to quar- ters of the year, the monthly data exhibit the same type of results.

Since these time and quantity shifts occurring in the data are explainable, it is conjectured that this peak sighting time frame (1800 - 2400 hours) is a result of de- mographics-related parameters. Since UFO phenomena are not detectable unless they occur within time frames that witnesses are available to view them, they may have been happening equally during all hours of all months. Time by Day of Week Sightings between 2000 and 2400 hours have varied between 43 and 60 percent (average 52 percent) of the data, depending on the day, but data averages for every day of the week agree that this time period has resulted in more sightings than any other, based on 481 reports that include data for both day and time. Time by Type of Sighting From 582 cases that include the time of day, a larger per- centage of sightings (66 percent) occurred during 1800 - 2400 hours than any other six-hour period, irrespective of the type of sighting (CE, MA, FB, or AN). DURATION Not surprising, most sightings (two out of three, ac- cording to this data) lasted no more than 10 minutes. Three out of 11 lasted 10-99 minutes, and one out of 20 lasted 100 minutes or longer. Duration by Type of Sighting The results based on the type of sighting are given in Table 2-4. As could be anticipated, the FB and AN type sightings - the \"fly bys\" and anomalies - had a larger percentage at the low end (less than one minute). Table 2-4.

Month • Distant sightings were more predominate between July and October than any other time of the year, the peak month being October. • CEs (close encounters) have occurred with almost equal regularity by month throughout the year. Day • With the exception of AN (anomaly) types of sight- ings, Wednesday has been responsible for the highest rate of sightings during the week, regardless of the time of year. Tuesday and Thursday have shared the honor of the second-highest rate. • AN types of sightings have occurred with greatest frequency on Friday. Time of the Day • Times for sightings have been specific to local - not global - measures. They have been associated with times that potential witnesses are best available, which is probably not just the times that observable anomalies oc- cur. • The peak times for sightings has been 1800 - 2400 hours (6:00 - 12:00 p.m.), regardless of the month, day, or type of sighting. The peak rate of sightings has oc- curred during 2100 hours (9:00 - 9:59 p.m.). Duration • Over 65 percent of the sightings have lasted less than 10 minutes. • The AN and FB types have a higher percentage of sightings lasting less than one minute, compared to CE and MA types (38 versus 19 percent, average). • Sighting durations have been independent of.month, day, and time. Significance of Meteor Showers Meteor showers have not contributed significantly to the database (10 percent or less). PREVIEW OF SECTION 3 Locations of sightings, shifts over the years, coordi- nates representing the maximum numbers of sightings, and related issues are discussed. Are AN types of sight- ings different from the others? Are CEs more concen- trated by location than other types? Section 3 will help resolve these and other questions.

Theories as to the origin of the so-called Tunguska Event have gener- ated numerous articles and several books. They range from a large asteroid or comet, to a nuclear-fueled space- ship of extraterrestrial origin. Now it appears something similar may have tran- spired in the equally sparsely populated Brazilian jungle in 1930, according to a recent article in the English sci- ence weekly. New Scientist (November II, 1995, p. 12). The Brazilian event was reported in some newspa- pers at the time, and was even investigated by a Catholic missionary. Father Fidele d'Alviano, who wrote a report for L'Osservatore Romano, the papal newspaper. But d'Alviano's account had largely disappeared from view. It was first cited in a 1931 paper by Leonid Kulik of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, who initially investigated the Tunguska explosion, and then again in a 1989 article in The Journal of the International Meteor Organization by scientists Nikolai Vasilyev and Gennadij Andreev, referencing Kulik's original citation. British astronomer Mark Bailey, of the Armagh Observatory, backtracked the reference to d'Alviano's original article, aided by two local schoolboys, Damian Markham and James Scriven. Based on interviews with eyewitnesses, d'Alviano describes the event and its con- sequences — it happened at eight in the morning, August 13, 1930 — in graphic style, but omits many key details that would aid astronomers in ascertaining origin. Hope is still held, though, as d'Alviano kept voluminous diaries, which the Vatican still possesses, and which Bailey wants to review. Shortly before the explosion along its border with Peru in northwestern Brazil, says d'Alviano, the sun turned red and then the sky went totally dark, followed by a rain of white ash and an ear-piercing whistle. Then three fireballs streaked across the sky and exploded, their rumblings heard hundreds of kilometers around. Months later, some of the affected forest was still smol- dering. Bailey notes that three house-sized objects were prob- ably involved, resulting in a combined one-megaton explosion, or about a tenth of the estimated energy re- leased in the Tunguska Event. Whatever their cause — the Brazilian bombs occurred at the height of the annual Perseids meteor shower — such large scale invaders may be far more common than we previously suspected, says Bailey, when coupled in time with the earlier Tunguska explosion, perhaps ten times as common. \"The Earth may be subjected to three or four [such events] a century,\" he warns. As far as the twentieth century is concerned, then, that's two down and perhaps two to go, which could cer- tainly make for some Millennium-ending or beginning fireworks. It seems patently unlikely anyone is aiming these things, but here's hoping, if they are, that they continue to target highly unpopulated areas as in the past. Otherwise, we'll all read about it — except those directly impacted. — Dennis Stacy TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE For almost eight years the UFO sightings in the Gulf Breeze/Pensacola area have remained unsolved. Depending on your point of view, there are only two an- swers: PAGE 12 NUMBER 333 JANUARY 1996"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL 1) The UFOs are real and as yet still unidentified, or 2) the UFOs are not real; they are simply misidenti- fied. Many scores of witnesses have come forward to tell of seeing a wingless, soundless, flying object perform aerial feats apparently impossible for conventional air- craft. Even so, either of the above answers can explain these single witness and multi-witness UFO sightings. Scores of photographs and video tapes have been taken during local UFO sightings. If the photographs and video tapes show a distant glowing light, or the pho- tographs show no structural detail, again, either of the above answers still applies. But . . . what if the photographs and video tapes show an \"oops, there it is,\" \"knock your socks off,\" flying, wingless, soundless object in broad daylight? The debate will continue despite any amount of defini- tive proof. The reason for this is a psychological one (kind of a knee-jerk, human nature kind of thing): The more ab- solute the evidence, the more it cannot be real, and since it can't be real ... answer #2 applies... it must be a hoax. Why? Because, if UFOs were real, our govern- ment officials would tell us everything they know about UFOs, wouldn't they? Therefore UFOs can't be real, right? So here is the dilemma. What is it so many people are seeing? What is it they are photographing and video taping? The photographs I took eight years ago and some more recently, show \"something\" that looks like what \"can't be.\" I wrote two books about what so many of us have seen or thought we saw. So, what is it? What was that spherical, silver object that shows so clearly in the picture I took on January 12, 1994. You know, that unbelievable picture that shows what \"couldn't\" be an F-15 jet fighter racing past in front of what \"couldn't\" be a UFO. The Air Force said the jet fighter was a Navy F-14, and the non-UFO was \"a bunch of weather balloons tied together.\" Ah, now we are getting somewhere ... \"a bunch of weather balloons.\" Great! At least it's an answer (even though it doesn't even come close to looking like \"a bunch of weather balloons\") instead of the usual \"no comment.\" Seriously, my point is this. There seems to be a nor- mal reaction whenever clear, factual UFO evidence is presented. Which is, if the UFO evidence is too good, it can't be real. Not so long ago, on July 21,1 witnessed several \"fly- bys\" and captured them on video. The UFO can be seen clearly entering the field of view, crossing halfway (camera was on full zoom) and reversing direction. Below the UFO can be seen the Gulf Breeze shoreline, the Santa Rosa sound, and the 40-foot tall trees that cover Shoreline Park. The UFO briefly cast its shadow on the trees that line the beach. What does that mean? The UFO is real; and the shadow proves it. UFO witnesses, UFO photos, UFO videos, shadow evidence, etc. etc.... So what do you think? Is it all too good and too much to be true, or are we witnessing a historic event? Join me in considering the possibilities. Based on the worldwide distribution of The GulfBree-e Sightings and UFO Abductions in Gulf Breeze, thousands of UFO witnesses continue to send me their sighting reports, their UFO photographs and videos. The evidence is overwhelming — but it is not too good to be true. It is too good to be ignored. (Reprinted from the Pensacola Beach, FL Islander.) — Ed Walters Saucers and the Surreal by Paul Rydeen The comparative religion/comparative mythology approach to ufology is one I've found insightful. Recently I've found another source of pertinent im- agery: the art of the Surrealist Movement. Some may ar- gue that all UFO incidents are surreal, but I see more specific parallels as well. Max Ernst is a good example. He assembled three \"novels\" consisting entirely of collages made from woodcut engravings in popular works of fiction — JANUARY 1996 NUMBER 333 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ,Afe-fe^^^ '•' : Jr&?&& '., : '• A.* S^&^^Kli Illusiraiions hy Men Ernti \"dime novels\" of romance and adventure from the turn of the century. Lafemme 100 tetes ( 1929) was the first. It is available in the US from George Braziller (New York, 1981) under the mistranslated title The Hundred Headless Woman. Pages 167, 171. and 181 show large flying disks in the air. Page 241 shows a huge globe borne aloft on a suspended tapestry between two tropi- cal trees. Pages 163 and 169 show crashed spheres being excavated. Page 179 shows two giant Catherine wheels riding \"the bitter waves.\" The captions variously refer to the hundred-headed woman who chases men down on these globes or disks for her own mysterious ends. If I read the \"novel\" correctly, the hundred-headed woman is the spirit of Surrealism herself, whom Ernst puts forth as the herald of a new modern age. Ernst's A Little Girl Dreams of Taking the Veil (1930), also published by Braziller (1982), shows on page 91 a sleeping woman apparently abducted by three very alien-looking individuals, one of whom holds a glowing globe above her head as the others lay her in a coffin. Une Semaine De Bonte (A Week of Kindness, original 1934, published in the US by Dover, 1976), is also worth seeking out. M.C. Escher was not an actual member of the move- ment, but his recurring themes are definitely in the spirit of Surrealism. \"His Dream\" (1935) shows a sleeping bishop upon whose chest a giant mantis sits.Whitley Strieber mentions such a mantis while recounting his various abduction experiences in the best-selling Communion. Studies for Escher's engraving show the bishop was modeled after a mummified body resting in a catacombs. Insects are quite common in surrealist works. While not wishing to stretch my point too far, I find the ants of- ten shown by Salvador Dali reminiscent of the \"hive mind\" recently attributed to our alien abductors. They may represent industry, but they also speak of decay and death. Ernst's three novels also abound with insect ac- tivity. There are many other images associated with various contactees. Certainly few are the sole property of ufol- ogy, but their placement seems to call to mind the meth- ods of Surrealism. Incongruous combination of seem- ingly disparate elements is one of the strongest. Random assemblages based on intuition rather than reason are an- other. The original Surrealists experimented with auto- matic writing, hypnotism, and dreams in order to bypass the conscious day-world and reach the secret Other. Sound familiar? In short, what I propose is an examination of other possible sources of imagery which may shed light on the UFO enigma. We may not answer the questions How? or Why?, but we may gain a better understanding of why we react the way we do. That alone is worth the effort. By T. David Spencer MUFON Deputy Director, Investigations LOG #951111C, CE-1, 09/15/95. Investigator: Amara and Kyle Kubiak At 0430 hours, Ken and Janet (pseudonyms) were preparing to go to bed. Ken looked out the window and saw a distant light low in the sky and thought it might be one of the many helicopters he had seen flying over the area that evening. Instead of flashing lights, Ken no- ticed four unwavering, white lights — one on each side and two in the middle, which convinced him it must be something other than a helicopter. \"Oh, my gosh, it's a UFO!\" he exclaimed to Janet, then ran out the door with her to get a better view. On the porch, they watched as the object silently de- scended toward them, coming into plain view beginning about one-half mile away. The object reached 600 feet or so distance in about 10 seconds. \"It was right in front of us, floating.\" Janet explained. Suddenly, \"it got really bright where we were stand- ing,\" and the object appeared directly over them. Janet saw a smooth, metallic-surfaced disc, looking like two plates, with one inverted over the other and the four PAGE 14 NUMBER 333 JANUARY 1996"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL white lights in the gap between them. It was hovering 30-50 feet above their house. Blue and red lights out- lined the edges of the \"plates,\" the blue above and the red below and to the sides of the four white lights. Very shortly, there was a faint booming sound fol- lowed by a roar like a jet engine, and the object streaked off upward and westward into the distance, out of sight. LOG # 950924cC, MA-1, 07/30/94. Investigator: Ed Surma Noble (pseudonym) had the first of two sightings near dusk on July 30, 1994, while he was looking over his corn field located northwest of a small town in north central Texas. He thought he saw a plane approaching from a distance, with flashing white lights at both ends of a string that also contained red and green lights. Then, the lights stopped moving, dropped to half their al- titude, and ascended back to their previous level. They turned 90 degrees and moved in a zig-zagging, erratic manner westward until they were out of sight. No object was seen, but the movements of the lights were as if attached. The altitude was estimated to be close to 1,000 feet, and the span of the lights was thought to be \"about the same size as a small plane at a mile away.\" (The Field Investigator estimated distance to be about 4,000 feet, based on Noble's estimate of height and elevation angle.) Speed was estimated to be 200 m.p.h. or less. LOG #950924dC, MA-1, 08/01/94. Investigator: Ed Surma On August 1, 1994, at dusk, Noble again saw the lights. As he was driving west on a rural road, he looked to his right (northward) and saw the same configuration he had seen two days earlier, white-green-red-red-green- white, moving southward. This time, however, the lights were rapidly pulsing, and a second set of lights fol- lowed them. The second set was gaining on the first, but veered away when they were close to each other. Noble then lost sight, due to driving. Later, Noble returned to the corn field with his father, and the lights returned, coming toward them. The white lights extinguished and the others flickered. The as- sembly of lights then moved to the southwest without turning (still facing the two men), accelerated to a high speed, and disappeared in the distance.

It would seem that this project supports the com- monly held view among ufologists that UFOs are par- ticularly interested in nuclear installations and that mil- itary personnel have observed and reported such craft on numerous occasions hovering around missile silos and other highly sensitive areas. Indeed, the famous Roswell incident occurred near the only nuclear bomb storage fa- cility at the time, Roswell Army Air Field. Blum's story does not end there, however. It seems that one person present at the demonstration, a Colonel Harold E. Phillips of the DIA, had seen a UFO forty years previously and had a particular interest in fol- lowing up on what he saw that day. He decided to seek the assistance of the remote viewers on another case he knew about. It seems that at NORAD headquarters, buried deep within Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, radar used to monitor space debris had recently picked up an unusual unknown object travelling at a high rate of speed and changing course, something that space junk doesn't do. The incident had caused great alarm at the time, but the object eventually disappeared from the screens as mysteriously as it had appeared. Col. Phillips decided to ask the viewers to conduct a new experiment. The precise latitude and longitude of the object's original location was given the viewers and they were instructed to scan for anything unusual at that location within the past 48 hours and to draw what they saw. Each viewer was placed in a separate isolation chamber before being given the instructions. At the end of the day the three sketches were faxed to the colonel's office at the Pentagon. Blum reports, \"They were all crude, largely geometric pencil drawings. Each was obviously the work of a different artist, but all were quite similar. They were all rounded, wingless aircraft.\" With this evidence, \"the DIA was persuaded the time had come to convene a top-secret working group to in- vestigate the possibility that extraterrestrials were mak- ing contact with this planet. . .\" JANUARY 1996 NUMBER 333 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL BREAKTHROUGH: THE NEXT STEP by Whitley Strieber HarperCollins, 1995, hb, 297 pp., $23 Reviewed by Sean Casteel W hen Whitley Strieber first hit the top of the New York Times bestseller list in 1987 with the first in his series of first-person alien abduction accounts, the now legendary Communion, much of what he had to say blazed new trails of understanding about the abduction experience and popularized the subject with millions of readers who had never before taken UFO stories se- riously at all. When he followed that up with the re- spectably successful sequel. Transformation, there was again a huge audience waiting and eager to dive into Strieber's further adventures with the alien entities he has most often referred to as \"the Visitors.\" But Strieber sort of \"checked out\" for a while shortly afterwards. He said recently that he realized he was part of the process of bringing the abduction encounter experience closer to millions of people, and that he worried constantly whether he was helping those people toward some sort of alien-centered enlightenment or instead playing the role of a Pied Piper leading the chil- dren to something both terrifying and evil. After his crisis of conscience was over, he wrote Breakthrough: The Next Step mainly for other people who have had the experience and with whom he could share his own in- sights and methods of coping. There are those cynics who say that Strieber really wrote Breakthrough because he found his own horror fiction didn't sell nearly as well as his abduction books had. Released last May. the new book has yet to crack the bestseller list, and Strieber is already at work on a fourth book called The Secret School which will tell the story of many of his childhood encounters, the mem- ories of which have recently started to come back to him in a virtual flood. Breakthrough is divided into three sections, each of which takes up a different aspect of the phenomenon as experienced by Strieber, his family, and a few of his friends. For instance, in the first section of the book called \"The Communication,\" he invites a few friends and a film crew to spend the weekend at his cabin in the hope that \"the Visitors\" will show up and reveal them- selves. The aliens do arrive, and the confusion that fol- lows is reported with the same painful honesty that characterized the first two books. Strieber is also shown how his own life overlaps with close friends and how his relationships are inter- twined toward specific purposes that \"the Visitors\" seem From the mega-bestselling author of Communion itlev Stri to oversee with a firm and guiding hand. The chapters where the aliens make their presence felt not only to Whitley but also to one of his old friends, a woman named Dora Ruffner, imply an underlying framework for the guiding of the personal relationships of abductees that somehow serves both experiencers and the aliens si- multaneously. The middle section, called \"Beyond Communion,\" consists of further details of Strieber's experiences matched against his own philosophical and psycholog- ical musing and pondering. The death of Michael Talbot, the author of The Holographic Universe and a close friend of Strieber's, is an emotionally devastating ex- perience for Strieber, but it is also an opportunity for fur- ther speculation on the blending of the New Physics with the alien abduction events constantly happening to Strieber and the people around him. T he third and concluding section, called \"The Official Story,\" is a thoughtful summary of current cover-up and conspiracy theories as well as Strieber's take on var- ious governmental games designed to keep UFO be- lievers confused and off-balance, paranoid and suspi- cious. While this sort of thing has never been Strieber's real area of expertise, he does very well at reporting on PAGE 16 NUMBER 333 JANUARY 1996"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL the situation and giving readers new to this subject a good overview of the gap between the public denials and. the private classification of relevant information by a government determined to keep the lid on the subject that has so captured us all. I'm reminded of the joke singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell made to an audience as she laughingly apolo- gized for not writing songs the same way she used to. She said, \"It's like saying to Van Gogh, 'Hey, Vincent, paint \"A Starry Night\" again, man!'\" I suppose that is the same demand we make if we expect Whitley Strieber to give us another Communion or Transformation. We're asking the impossible of a writer who's already given so much to the field of UFO research merely by living and writing his own story with an honesty and an un- flinchingly thorough self-examination that brings the reality of \"the Visitors\" closer to us with every turn of the page. The courage to reveal the deeply personal, subjective elements of the experience to a world al- ways on the verge of laughter at the tales abductees tell (which they often do with a nearly compulsive hon- esty) lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of alien abduction outside the framework of \"nuts and bolts\" or \"typical\" abduction scenarios. Simply because an experience happens to just one person does not mean that it cannot be considered relevant to the field overall. We are not merely a medical or psychological speci- men of \"the Visitors,\" Strieber tells us, but are thinking, feeling entities entering into what may prove a long and productive relationship with them. And forging that relationship, as slow and painful as that process often seems, may eventually be the salvation of the world.

Expedientes Insolitos: El fenomeno OVNI y los Archives de Defensa by Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos Reviewed by Richard F. Haines H aving known Vicente-Juan for many years I con- tinue to marvel at his long-standing personal dedication to high quality UFO research and his prolific writing for the benefit of others. He has pro- duced four major and excellently written books about UFOs and. unfortunately for English speaking people, all are in Spanish so far. Nevertheless, his research is first rate and his selection of topics is both interesting and valuable. This is no less true for his latest book whose title in English is \"Weird Files: The UFO Phenomenon and the Defense Archives.\" Published by the large and prestigious firm of Temas 'de hoy (Madrid) in April 1995, this 300-page book presents many dia- grams, photos, and actual facsimiles of Spanish military documents obtained by the author over the years. The book's prologue is by noted Spanish journalist Javier Sierra and its epilogue is by Jacques Vallee, a writer and student of the phenomena who needs no in- troduction. The first two chapters include a collection of twelve UFO reports of high strangeness from Spain obtained over the past ten years, followed by several cases about objects and other phenomena which were subsequently identified. The objective? To show that most UFO ob- servations are misidentifications of natural, i.e., ex- plainable events. The third chapter turns to the important subject of the kinds of research methods one needs in or- der to study UFO phenomena. In order to stay as close to the evidence as possible, the author wisely focuses on his own research findings over the past thirty years — landings and trace statistics, human testimony, even cases involving death (\"probably caused by UFO radia- tion\"), etc. are covered. The longest (fourth) chapter (83 pages long) is titled \"The Air Force Reveals its Secrets.\" It presents, for the first time, declassified abstracts of this valuable mater- ial. Ballester Olmos begins this seminal chapter with how he succeeded, almost single handedly, in getting formerly closed military files declassified and released. Many American, British. French, German and other in- vestigators would do well to read how he did it. He moves forward to outline some statistics on the forty five Air Force cases he received (e.g., the frequency of UFO report occurrence continues at a rate of about zero to three cases per year except for 1968 which had 21). The remainder of this chapter presents extended ab- stracts of 37 selected reports of sightings made by Air Force personnel and others; they should be translated into English for the benefit of American researchers. The last two chapters focus on the efforts and ac- complishments of numerous so-called \"first\" and \"sec- ond\" generation UFO researchers in Spain (chapter 5), and a well known American UFO investigator (chapter 6), not only to recognize their efforts but to encourage younger enthusiasts to follow in their footsteps. Ballester Olmos states in this regard, \". . . if science does not cover this subject (proving that this enigma is amenable of scientific study), it will be a field entirely left to charlatans.\" Expedientes Insolitos is a valuable addition to the collections of serious UFO investigators of any country. Those of us in the United States can only hope for an English language edition in the near future.

The title of this singular work, conducted by the Belgium-based Caelestia Project, is Unidentified Aerial Object Photographed near Zwischbergen, Switzerland, on July 26, 1975: A Case Analysis. This isn't exactly the sort of sensationalistic title or come-on guaranteed to ensure high sales, but it is indicative of the industry and seri- ousness with which the Caelestia Project and authors Wim van Utrecht and Frits van der Veldt undertook their study. The case, also popularly referred to as the \"Saas Fee photo,\" after the nearby well-known ski resort of the same name, has been highly regarded within ufological circles. The late Dr. J. Allen Hynek once referred to it as one of the best UFO pictures ever taken, and it's been featured on the cover of several books and videos. (A sharp, professional color print made from the original slide is included with the book.) But is it a photograph of what Bruce Maccabee refers to as a TRUFO — a true UFO? I won't give away the authors' conclusions here, but will say that anyone seriously interested in learning the art, as well as the science, of UFO investigation should consider this the classic textbook example of how to conduct one, from interviewing the original witnesses and after-the-fact photoanalysis, to the meticulous ac- cumulation of meteorological and other data — over- turning every stone and following every clue wherever it leads in the process — and the final compilation of a clear, readable, comprehensive report. The amount of work that went into this project is monumental and shows on almost every one of the book's 240 pages, which include more than 80 pho- tographs, drawings and maps. Given the resources, this is how we would like to see every UFO case investi- gated — if only we could. The format is that of a quality paperback, with slick covers and high-quality internal pages, nicely illustrated as already said. And did I mention that it's all in English? The price ($27.00 US) is a bit high for American readers, but the information and lessons therein verge on the invaluable.

Almost at the opposite end of the scientific spec- trum is The Gift: The Crop Circles Deciphered, which isn't to say that this beautifully illustrated and produced PAGE 18 NUMBER 333 JANUARY 1996"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL hardbound book isn't an equal labor of love, only that it's sometimes hard to figure out what author Doug Ruby intends to say vs. what he does say, and what, if any, probative value the whole has. As best as this re- viewer can determine, Ruby (the dustjacket describes him as a former Air Force and commercial airline pilot) once read a handful of books about crop circles and, without so much as ever visiting a single site in person, nonetheless had a personal epiphany about their ultimate meaning one day in the living room of his Cape Canaveral, Florida, apartment, resulting in the present volume. I suppose more has been made of less, but rarely so picturesquely as here. For one thing, Ruby never so much as even remotely entertains the notion that some of the circle formations he employs to such ef- fect may have been the handiwork of \"simple\" homo sapiens, i.e., hoaxes, as opposed to enigmatic extrater- restrials. If I read the author correctly, Ruby apparently be- lieves that crop circles are a two-dimensional represen- tation of a three-dimensional reality, and that the latter reveals the true nature of UFOs and their propulsion sys- tems. As I say, it's all very vague, but worked out so wonderfully that one almost wishes Ruby will eventually be proved right. But the scientist in me says the chances of such vindication are slim. What Ruby does is take diagrams of various crop circles and \"insectograms\" and turn them on edge, or at right angles to reality. Thus the lateral pathway of a complex pictogram becomes a vertical spindle to which the various elements are attached at 90 degree angles. The whole is then modeled in wood, painted, attached to an electrical motor, spun at high speed and photographed in black and white and glorious living color. In fact, hardly a page of The Gift passes without some sort of graphic diagram or photograph. As said, the result is a wondrous work (the cost of the entire enterprise must have been considerable), and one a reviewer feels some- what churlish about for criticizing at all. But could such love's labor lost be wholly without scientific merit? Alas, I'm afraid so. But that wouldn't necessarily pre- vent me from plunking down $32.95, postage included, for what amounts to a uniquely subjective point of view. Another like it you won't encounter soon.

Lewis, is another one of those books that engenders ambivalency. On the one hand it's an academic collection of essays that treats a subset of the UFO phenomenon (contactees and cults) with seriousness (something we all welcome); on the other, it's evidence that some mainstream psychologists and sociologists either haven't read the available litera- ture, or, when they have, still can't quite seem to get the most basic and fundamental facts straight (which we all deplore). In short, there are some very good chapters, or essays, here, and some very bad ones in the bargain, which, con- sidering the high academic price tag ($57.50), isn't that much of a bargain. You may want your library to order a copy before you do, in other words, or opt for the much more affordable paperback edition ($19.95, ISBN 0-7914-2330-1). One of the book's decided pluses is Chapter 10, \"The Flying Saucer Contactee Movement, 1950-1994: A Bibliography,\" consisting of more than a thousand bibliographical references compiled by J. Gordon Melton and George M. Eberhart. Among the better essays: Melton's \"The Contactees: A Survey,\" \"Waiting for the Ships: Disillusionment and the Revitalization of Faith in Bo and Peep's UFO Cult\" by Robert W. Balch, and \"Spiritualism and UFO Religion in New Zealand: The International Transmission of Modern Spiritual Movements\" by Robert S. Ellwood, which deals with, among other things, Adamski's 1959 tour of New Zealand.

This is a profusely illustrated, trade-sized paperback of 191 pages, Part Six of which is devoted to UFOs. Cases of healings, ghosts, poltergeists, and near-death experiences are also covered. In general, the contents appear to be a cut above the usual sort of thing of this stripe. The English price is 10.99 Pounds, or approximately $22.00 US.

Without Consent, by Carl Nagaitis and Philip Mantle, is subtitled \"A Comprehensive Survey of Missing-Time and Abduction Phenomena in the UK.\" The writing style is somewhat breathless, but the concentration on United Kingdom abduction cases provides much new material for the American reader.

Encyclopedia of the Unexplained, by Jenny Randies and Peter Hough, is a well illustrated collection of the odd and unusual, profusely illustrated and running to 240 pages. Barnes and Noble is the publisher of the American edition, which you can probably find on sale in this country for under $10.00. Many of the pho- tographs will be unfamiliar. There is much UFO and re- lated material here, including sections on Men in Black, Ball Lightning, and Animal Mutilations. Lavishly illustrated books seem to be the trend, and UFOs and How to See Them by Jenny Randies is no ex- ception.The dustjacket says there are more than a hun- dred photographs herein, \"many in color and published here for the first time.\" This book was first published in England in 1992, but is well worth tracking down.

Letters to Mufon UFO Journal ROSWELL'S FLYING WING Kevin Randle's response to Stan Friedman's list of 38 \"false claims made by Kevin Randle and/or Don Schmitt\" (\"Search for Truth About Roswell,\" Journal, October 1995), includes yet another repetition of the false claim I \"told people Roswell was explained as a flying wing\" (claim 27). This is a base canard (no pun intended), and Randle knows it — and has known it for over two years. On May 18, 1993, during a conversation on the site where rancher Mac Brazel discovered the debris that launched a thousand speculations and several books, it was suggested to me Roswell may have involved the crash of a Northrop flying wing. A flying wing buff since childhood, I was highly skeptical, but my source was someone whose suggestions one takes seriously, and just the day before, alleged Roswell witness Frank Kaufmann had told me the crashed craft was winglike. So I did some checking. About two hours of research established without a doubt that as an explanation for Roswell, the flying wing does not fly. In a telephone conversation on June 12, 1993, I discussed the flying wing notion and my doubts about it with CUFOS's Mark Rodeghier in much the same terms outlined above. I followed up with a letter to Rodeghier on June 28, 1993, summing up my negative findings. On July 12, 1993,1 provided these findings to Randle and Schmitt for use as a supporting discursive footnote or sidebar to an article they were preparing for the'International UFO Reporter, debunking the flying wing explanation. (They did not use the material, so in slightly different form it became a letter to the editor in IUR, Sept/Oct 1993.) In late July, I discussed my negative views and why I had bothered to pursue the matter at all with Don Schmitt in person. Randle cites as confirmation of his false claim a newsletter article by Terry Endres and the late Pat Packard. In this article, Endres and Packard transmute my comments to Mark Rodeghier from those of an in- vestigator intent upon pursuing a plausible if doubtful lead to an unequivocal endorsement of a crashed flying wing explanation for Roswell. They also report Roswell photographer Jack Rodden — incorrectly identified as having \"firsthand knowledge of the Roswell debris\"— claims I told him I thought a crashed flying wing could well be the answer to Roswell. This claim is particularly curious, since my breakfast (not, as reported by Endres and Packard, lunch) meeting with Rodden took place on May 15, 1993, three days before the flying wing idea was suggested to me. The Roswell saga has many pe- culiar elements, but to my knowledge, this is the first in- stance of precognition The bottom line: Randle knows I never have en- dorsed a flying wing explanation for Roswell. So why does he continue to repeat this falsehood? — Karl T.

All State Directors were ad- vised by a letter nearly a year ago to utilize this number for filing hot UFO cases that came to their attention. A letter announcing the 800 number was mailed to all sheriff's offices and police chiefs in Texas last spring as a means of testing and evaluating the effectiveness of the system. The majority of our calls, to-date, have been from people who called the 800 directory and asked for \"UFO\" to report sightings or to seek UFO information. To send letters to every police department and sher- iff's office throughout the U.S.A. would obviously be both expensive and time-consuming. We would like for every State Director, State Section Director, Field Investigator, and Field Investigator Trainee to notify your local sheriff, police chief, and state highway patrol office of MUFON's 800 number via a postcard that they may post on their bulletin boards or at the dis- patcher's desk. Presently, we are attempting to answer all calls \"live.\" An answering box records the calls received late at night or early mornings. These sighting reports will be mailed or telephoned to the nearest State Section Director, State Director, or Field Investigator for a per- sonal interview. Brief replies to these cases under in- vestigation may be made to MUFON on the 800 num- ber. (The answering box is limited to three minutes.) However, this number is not to be used for other MU- FON communications. The MUFON business office number is (210) 379-9216.

SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS COVER DESIGN CONTEST The theme for the MUFON 1996 International UFO Symposium is \"UFOLOGY: A Scientific Enigma.\" We endeavor to depict this theme in the cover artwork. Obviously, this requires considerable ingenuity and something unique in design. The 8 1/2\" x 11\" size will be printed in black on a light pastel color leatherette stock. Since small and intricate details do not print well on a leatherette stock, please take this into consideration in your design. The winning design may also be used on the symposium program in Greensboro, NC. The dead- line for submission is April 15, 1996. The winner will receive an honorarium of $100 cash plus $100 worth of MUFON publications of your choice. Good luck.

JANUARY 1996 NUMBER 333 PAGE 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Walter Andrus NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP/SUBSCRIPTION INCREASE It may seem amazing to most Journal readers that the annual membership/subscription price has not increased for nine and one-half years, whereas inflation, paper, printing costs, employee labor, and postage charges have raised significantly. The more expensive kem- coated Journal cover is a radical improvement over the light-weight yellow cover on the February 1986 issue, giving our magazine a professional appearance along with the overall quality improvement in the contents. We were able to hold the annual price at $25 in the U.S.A. and $30 foreign through a steady increase in subscrip- tions and by supplementing publishing costs and labor from other sources. The Journal is our most important communication medium to our members worldwide. however it must be financially supportive of itself, not a liability. MUFON overhead has increased substantially over the past five years with the employment of the International Director, Assistant to the Director, UFO Database Administrator, and the Abduction Transcription Project Manager who were all formerly volunteers. Support income from the Bigelow Foundation to fund expansion and research was abruptly discontinued in July 1995. necessitating a study of MU- FON's financial status so as to continue its solvency. In both the September and October issues of the Journal. all readers were advised of the study being conducted by the Executive Committee on a new dues structure. As the world's leading UFO organization, we want to continue to cultivate membership worldwide. However, we are cognizant of the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to foreign currency in many countries, where the sub- scription price is already prohibitive for the average person who would like to join MUFON. The MUFON Board of Directors has recommended that the annual membership/subscription price in the U.S.A. be in- creased from $25 to $30 and retain the present $30 for foreign countries. It has also been recommended that a study should be conducted three years hence (1998) for a similar evaluation of MUFON's financial status to determine the validity of this increase. The new dues structure will become effective January 1, 1996. The cover price for a single copy will remain at $3. We pride ourselves for having published the finest monthly UFO magazine in the world and expect to con- tinue to do so with your loyal support. The UFO enigma still represents the greatest mystery of the space age therefore your most valuable asset to staying abreast of the phenomenon is your monthly MUFON UFO Journal magazine.
