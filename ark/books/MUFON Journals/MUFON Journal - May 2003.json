The latest informant is not an eyewitness, but the wife of an eyewitness, thus joining the considerable ranks of secondary witnesses to the Roswell incident. Her name is Anne Robbins, 84-year-old widow of TSgt. Ernest Robert Robbins, who reportedly as- sisted at a crash site 56 years ago. Present at the site, Robbins told his wife, were three occupants of the craft-one dead, one near death, and one apparently quite healthy. Mrs. Robbins says she clearly recalls that night in July of 1947. The couple had gone to a dinner party at the NCO Club at the Ernest Robert Robbins as a young sergeant. Roswell base, returning home around 10:30 or 11 p.m. After going to bed they became aware of \"every- thing outside lit up like it was daylight.\" They assumed the light had come from helicopters from the base, flying with their searchlights on. Not long after this, Sgt. Robbins received a call to return to the base. Mrs. Robbins says she assumed at the time that there had been an aircraft crash, but was puzzled as to why her husband had been called. His normal duties involved sheet metal work on planes. Sgt. Robbins returned home the following evening, his uniform wet and wrinkled. In response to her inquiries, he said he had to go through the decontamination tank, dressed in the same clothing that he had worn \"when I was out there.\" Following more questions, he finally said, \"Well, I guess you might as well know. It's going to be in the papers. A UFO crashed outside of Roswell.\" Mrs. Robbins says her husband did not appear to be emotionally upset, but told her he was not going to talk about the incident. He showered and went to bed. The next morning, however, Mrs. Robbins continued to quiz him, and he added some details. He explained that the UFO looked like two saucers put together, and that on the top layer there were oblong-shaped windows all the way around it. He said he had not looked inside the craft, but told her that there were three \"people\" who were apparently in The 84-year-old widow of Sgt. Robbins says she clearly recalls the 1947 event the craft when it crashed. He said one was dead, one was injured, and one seemed to be okay. He said he could not tell her anything else. However, a few days later he agreed to drive his wife to the place where the craft had crashed, telling her, \"This is where I was for 18 hours.\" The site was deserted, and there was no sign of debris, but there was a large burned spot in the shape of what she described as \"a perfect circle, so black that it was shiny. No normal fire could have made something like that. It was as if the sand had been melted and turned into a sheet of black glass.\" She asked her husband what had been done with the craft and the entities, and he told her he could not tell her that information. That was the last time he discussed the incident until after he retired from the mili- tary. But when their son Ronald was in high school doing a a report on UFOs, Robbins was persuaded to talk briefly about the incident. He did not elaborate on what he had told his wife, but did draw a sketch of what the entities looked like, explaining that they had pear-shaped heads, large black eyes, brown skin, no nose, and no mouth. The Robbins' daughter, Barbara, recalls only that her father had been stationed at Roswell, and that he had acknowledged that a UFO had crashed there. .. Shortly before Sgt. Robbins' death in January of 2000, the couple watched a TV show about Roswell, and Mrs. Robbins again quizzed her husband about the event. Again he stated that \"it did land,\" but provided no additional in- formation. Mrs. Robbins says her husband was not one to lie or to embellish the truth. \"He was a good Christian man.\" She adds that he would never reveal something he had been told to keep secret, such as what happened to the craft and the bodies. \"That's just the way he was.\" When she filed Sgt. Robbins' death certificate two years ago she discovered, that he had been given an \"intellir gence clearance.\" She speculates that this may explain why an aircraft sheet metal repairman was called to the site of a crashed saucer in the middle of the night.

California Highway Patrol Officers Charles A. Carson and Stanley Scott were patrolling on Hoag Road, east of Corning, on Aug. 13, 1960, when they saw what ap- peared to be a huge airplane descending from the sky in front of them. Thinking that the plane was about to crash, they stopped their patrol car to get a better look. The object silently descended to about 100 to 200 feet from the ground, then suddenly climbed back to about 500 feet above the ground and stopped. Officer Carson later described the encounter in an of- ficial report: \"At this time it was clearly visible to both of us. It was surrounded by a glow, making the round or oblong object visible. At each end, or each side of the object, there were definite red lights. At times about five white lights were visible between the red lights. As we watched, the object moved again and performed aerial feats that were actually unbelievable.\" Despite static on their police radio, the officers were able to contact the Tehama County Sheriff's Office. They asked Deputy Clarence Fry to contact the local Air Force radar station at Red Bluff.-Fry reported back that the radar station verified that an unidentified object was vis- ible on radar. On two occasions the object moved directly towards the patrol vehicle, coming within 150 yards. Each time it approached, it turned and illuminated the area with a red light some six feet in diameter. The object's searchlights were on the ends where the red lights were located, but only one searchlight operated at a time. The officers had their .357 magnum pistols with ar- mor-piercing bullets ready, prepared to fire if the object came too close. Officer Scott turned the light on the pa- trol vehicle towards the object, and it immediately shot away. The officers observed that the object swept the sky and ground areas six or seven times. The object then began to move slowly to the east, and the officers followed. They reported that the object seemed aware of them, moving away as they approached, but occasionally moving closer when they stopped. When they had reached the Vina Plains Fire Station, the object, now a considerable distance away, was ap- proached by a second object that came from the south. The second object moved near to the first, and both stopped and hovered for some time, occasionally emitting red beams. After a time, both objects vanished below the east- ern horizon. The officers had observed the first object for a total of about two hours and fifteen minutes, part of the time from a forest lookout tower. During the encounter, static was picked up on the po- lice radio, but the interference was not sufficient to block communications. When they returned to the Tehama County Sheriff's Office, they discovered that the object had also been seen by Deputies Fry and Montgomery, as well as by the night jailer. Their descrip- tions were similar. The next day, Officers Carson and Scott drove to the Red Bluff Air Station to discuss the sighting and to speak to the operator who had seen it on radar. A Maj. LeRoy refused to allow them to talk to the radar operator, and said that nothing unusual had occurred. He denied that the object had been seen on radar, contradicting what the radar operator had told Deputy Fry the night before. The visit was unpleasant and unproductive. Additional information regarding the sighting was ob- tained by National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) investigator Walter N. Webb, who contacted Carson and received a copy of the report, draw- ings of the object, and a letter from Carson. Carson explained that the object \"was shaped like a football,\" and that \"the edges, or I should say outside of the object, were clear to us,\" and the glow \"was emitted by the object,\" and \"was not a reflection of other lights.\" The \"official\" explanation for the sighting made little sense. In a letter to a NICAP investigator, the Air Force said: \"The findings [are] that the individuals concerned wit- nessed a refraction of the planet Mars and the bright stars Aldebaran and Betelgeux (sic). . . [Temperature inver- sions] contributed to the phenomena as the planet Mars was.quite low in the skies and the inversion caused it to be projected upward. \"A contributing factor to the sightings could have been the layer of smoke which hung over the area in a thin stratiform layer. This smoke from the forest fires in the area hung in a layer due to the stable conditions associ- ated with the inversions.\" When NICAP pointed out that Mars, Aldebaran, and Betelgeuse were all below the horizon at the time of the sighting, the Air Force changed the star involved to Capella, which was slightly above the eastern horizon at the time. They neglected the fact that Capella would have risen in the sky, whereas the objects disappeared below the east- ern horizon at the end of the sighting. Officer Carson had this reaction to the Air Force ex- Page4 MUFON UFO Journal May 2003"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"planations: \"I have been told we saw Northern lights, a weather balloon, and now refractions. I served four years with the Air Force. I believe I am familiar with the North- ern lights, also weather balloons. Officer Scott served as a paratrooper during the Korean Conflict.\" He added, \"Both of us are aware of the tricks light can play on the eyes during darkness. We were aware of this at the time. Our observations and estimations of speed, size, etc. came from aligning the object with fixed objects on the horizon. I agree we find it difficult to believe what we were watching, but no one will ever convince us that we were witnessing a refraction of light.\" Astronomer and \"bunker\" Donald Menzel agreed with (or advised?) the Air Force that the sighting was due to temperature inversions, but a check of the meteorological records of the area for that night by atmospheric physi- cist James E. McDonald failed to find any evidence that would indicate the presence of a tempera- ture inversion. NICAP called the investigation and explanation by the Air Force \"one of the most strained on record.\" Over the next week, similar sightings were reported, including another sighting the very next evening by Depu- ties Fry and Montgomery, as well as by a Corning police officer. In addition, several reports came in from wit- nesses throughout the area. In 1966 McDonald visited the scene to personally talk to the witnesses, but Scott had died in a plane crash, Fry was no longer in law enforcement and could not be lo- cated, and Sheriff Williams said he could no longer recall statements about radar tracking the object. New NASA study indicates Sun's increased radiation may be significant part of global warming In what could be the simplest explanation for one com- ponent of global warming, a new study shows the Sun's radiation has increased by .05 percent per decade since the late 1970s. The increase would only be significant to Earth's cli- mate if it has been going on for a century or more, said study leader Richard Willson, a Columbia University re- searcher also affiliated with NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The Sun's increasing output has only been monitored with precision since satellite technology allowed neces- sary observations. Willson is not sure if the trend extends further back in time, but other studies suggest it does. \"This trend is important because, if sustained over many decades, it could cause significant climate change,\" Willson said. In a NASA-funded study recently published in Geo- physical Research Letters, Willson and his colleagues speculate on the possible history of the trend based on data collected in the pre-satellite era. That does not mean industrial pollution has not been a significant factor, Willson cautioned. \"Solar activity has apparently been going upward for a century or more.\" Thanks to SPACE.com Poll participants believe some UFOs are spaceships John Colaw, membership director of Skywatch Inter- national, completed a poll April 9,2003, which involved 740 participants, with interviews from 24 different news teams and radio shows from all over the world, which helped keep the poll from being skewed to only UFO lists.

The following report could well be a model for investigators. My wife and I were preparing to leave our home near Greenbelt, MD, at 8:15 PM, when a strange wing-like object was observed overhead on March 8,2003. There was no aircraft body visible, even though there was ground light reflecting off the overcast clouds that should have clearly revealed any fuselage. The anomalous aerial object (AAO) was seen to emerge into view traveling on a twenty-degrees-east of a true north course, passing almost overhead. The \"wing\" spanned a full two degrees (120 ARC minutes), as con- trasted with the half-degree (about 30 arc minutes) cres- cent moon, for an immediate and good comparison of angular size. The object was perceived by binocular disparity (vi- sual parallax due to eye separation) as being 600 to a maximum of 1,200 feet overhead, and at the time its ac- tual maximum possible distance was constrained by a thin layer of clouds overhead. Officially, that cloud layer was overcast at 23,000 feet at 20:51. Most disturbing was the total silence of the nearby object. A bright, continuously white \"sphere\" was visible on the tip of each 'wing.' Each white \"sphere\" had a very sharp edge quite different from the lights on ordi- nary aircraft, and of a much purer white color. A much smaller (than the white \"spheres\") pure red light looked possibly more \"point-source\" and was located in the \"middle\" vertex of the \"wing.\" It was brightening and dimming, but at times it seemed more of a flicker or a pulse. The \"wing\" was quite strange. Although it was visible by the cloud backlighting, it was rather vague because subtle light around it seemed to vibrate or flicker at maybe ten hertz. All along and across the \"wing\" there was no sign of any aircraft type body. Since the sight was quite \"spooky,\" maybe one could call them \"disembodied wings.\" We live a few blocks north of the little College Park Airport, which is presently closed down to non-govern- ment air traffic due to security concerns. This object seemed so very low that my gut reaction was that it had taken off from there, despite the fact that it seemed to be on a very flat course (neither climbing nor descending). Subsequent inquiry to the airport revealed that there had been no takeoff around the 20:15 time of the first observation, and the airport had closed at 22:30, fifteen minutes before the second identical observation to be de- scribed below. Roughly fifty minutes after the first observation, an airliner type aircraft came over, possibly having taken off from Andrews AFB, just east of D.C. It was on a slightly more westward bearing and considerably higher up. We could see the aircraft's body, wings, and tail structure very clearly and hear it very distinctly. By contrast, the \"AAO\" had no body visible, but only that weird wing-like structure that seemed to shimmer. There was a bizarre silence, stillness, and smoothness that is hard to explain or even put into adequately descrip- tive words. After the object had disappeared beyond our north- northeastern horizon (taking roughly 30 seconds time to go from near zenith across the northern horizon), I ran up to the third floor where my Extreme Low-Frequency (ELF) magnetometer is located and noted a low-level, continuous magnetic pulse in roughly the 2-hertz range, accompanied by a few very strong \"spike\" type pulses, one of which may have pegged the needle. These were not normal background magnetics. About 10:46 PM, I was again upstairs with the magne- tometer, checking for any anomalous activity, when simi- lar magnetic phenomena began to again be seen by the action of the needle display, and on the analog frequency modulated audio output. Watching and listening to that, I suddenly heard a roar (seemingly directly overhead) that vaguely resembled a loud jet, but was distinctly different, somehow. Then af- ter maybe a 4 to 5-second duration, that roar suddenly subsided-taking about 0.5 second to go from loud to noth- ing. Because of the odd magnetic activity and the surpris- ing sound, at cessation of the sound I rushed downstairs and onto the front porch, from which I was surprised to see an exactly identical \"AAO\" (as compared to the 20:15 observation) on exactly the same course. As with the earlier \"AAO,\" I watched the object al- most directly overhead as it moved in spookily total si- lence to across the exact spot on the north-northeastern horizon into which the first object had headed and disap- peared. During the first observation, the sky above the thing was overcast, but in the second sighting it was totally clear, with all stars and planets visible. Still, I could see no \"body\" on the object, but only the \"wing.\" This time, too, the \"wing\" seemed to shimmer in a light-distorting way that made it much less clear than had the very clear wings, body, and tail section of the jet aircraft. In both observations of the identical \"AAO,\" when overhead the angular distance from white globe of light to white globe of light (\"wingtip\"-to-\"wingtip\") was about 120 minutes of arc (2 degrees), and I had a ready com- parison because the crescent moon (about 28 to 30 arc Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal May 2003"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"minutes) was still in the northwest during that second and identical observation. Clouds above an aircraft seem to amplify aircraft sounds to a ground observer, but although it was overcast during the 20:15 observation, even then not a sound of any kind could be heard. I found that really a bit spooky because both things were clearly under power, moving steadily and unwaveringly along precisely the same course in both observations. It was as if both had traveled upon the very same invisible track in the sky. Let me be clear in saying that I suspect this twice- seen object was some type of stealthy black-project air- craft (manned or unmanned) that is somehow propelled silently, but wonder at the wisdom of operating such a vehicle over this highly populated area within the Wash- ington, D.C., Beltway. Angular velocity of both \"AAOs\" averaged at three degrees per second, if the observation time in each case was 30 seconds. If 45 seconds, then it might have been two degrees per second. Oddly, everything seemed so still and quiet during the two passages of the objects that I am reminded of reports of a similar phenomenon (\"the OZ factor\") reported by certain observers of UFOs at close range. NASA scientists use proteins to make ultra-small structures NASA's Ames Research Center in California has in- vented a biological method to make ultra-small structures that may be used to produce electronics 10 to 100 times smaller than today's components. The new method uses modified proteins from \"extremophile\" microbes that live in near-boiling, acidic hot springs to grow mesh-like structures so small that an electron microscope is needed to see them. According to principal investigator Jonathan Trent, \"Our innovation takes advantage of the innate ability of pro- teins to form into ordered structures, and for us to use genetic engineering to change nature's plans, transform- ing these structures into something useful.\" The team took a gene from a single-celled organism that lives in near-boiling acid mud and changed the gene to add instructions that describe how to make a protein that sticks to gold or semiconductors, explained co-inves- tigator Andrew McMillan. The new protein is crystallized to form tiny, flat, lat- tice-like structures that act as nano-templates. The struc- tures are made of rings about 20 nanometers across, and are 5,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. The minute pieces of gold or semiconductor that stick to the protein are about one to 10 nanometers across. Today's standard computer chips have features that are roughly 130 nanometers apart. An array of nano- particles can serve as computer memory, a sensor, or as a logic device. Applications also exist in the biomedical field.

Teacher's diary records UFO from nearly 200 years ago Those who would argue that UFOs are not just a mod- ern-day phenomenon can point to several references in historical writings, including an American diary nearly 200 years old. . The diary was written by a school teacher, Cynthia Everett, who taught in Maine during the early 1800's. A woman well educated for her time, Ms. Everett recorded such natural events as earthquakes and meteor showers. She had attended Leicester Academy in Leicester, MA, a coeducational institution where women competed on a equal basis with men. The July 23,1808, diary entry recording the UFO sighting was written when Ms. Everett was 24 years old, still single, and living with a family near her school. She wrote in a steady hand on what is now yellowing rag paper: \"About 10 o'clock I saw a very strange appearance. It was a light which proceeded from the East. At the first sight, I though it was a meteor, but from its motion I soon perceived it was not. It seemed to dart at first as quickly as light, and appeared to be in the atmosphere, but low- ered toward the ground and kept on at an equal distance, sometimes ascending and sometimes descending. It moved round in the then visible horizon (it was not very light), and then returned back again, nor did we view it till it was extinguished.\" The diary was kept by Ms. Everett from 1804 until 1818, ceasing three days after she married John Ranlett, a widower with six children. It has been passed down in the family, and Dr. Judith Becker Ranlett, an historian who teaches at the State University College at Potsdam, NY, has recently taken on the task of transcribing the diary in 600 typed pages. It was she who discovered the entry regarding the un- explained light. Dr. Ranlett, whose husband is the great- great grandson of Ms. Everett, is using the diary to study the way women earned their own living in the early 19th Century. \"I have no feelings one way or the other on UFOs,\" she said.

NY, MUFON Sym- posium 2002. I pressed our director for more informa- tion, as I knew Betty had been retired for years, and I was a bit surprised that she would come out of retirement for this event. Betty did attend the symposium as a scheduled speaker. Her speech at the MUFON Symposium was titled \"Miracles.\" Ken Cherry, director of the Dallas/Fort Worth chap- ter of MUFON, asked about Betty, and we began to talk. He suspected that I knew Betty in some way by my com- ments. I told him, yes, I've known Betty for years. Ken encouraged me to make contact with Betty and see if she would be willing to sit down for a videotaped interview with me, and asked if I would present the inter- view to our local chapter. I said I would. I called Betty and she said \"showa\" in her rich, native. New England accent, which translates into \"sure.\" I flew up to New Hampshire, and after two sittings and hours of editing I felt I had an interview worth pre- senting. The video-taped interview was very well received by our MUFON chapter, and the comments following made me feel that it was all worth the effort.

Worth share the taped interview with others. The first thing that you notice about Betty is that she is unassuming, and her natural relaxed way of being is re- freshing, down-home, and true. She does not feel all that important, but believes it is very important that we con- tinue to study the UFO phenomenon and gather as much information as we can. Betty is fondly called the Grandmother of Ufology by many in the UFO community. It is a title she is aware of and is very proud to hold. She shares in the interview how thrilled she was to be at the International MUFON Symposium. With bursts of laughter, Betty recalls that on returning home she told her niece that she needed to increase her vitamin intake after hugging and kissing more than 200 people.

I stopped in at Scientific American Magazine in Manhattan and asked to speak to someone in the physics department. I got as far as talking to him on the phone. His first questions were \"Who is this scientist?, Does he have a doctorate in physics?, What university is he at? The request to explain the theory wasn't allowed to be discussed. 1 said that \"If he had a very valid theory you wouldn't look at it. but if Stephen Hawkins came up with a new theory that made no sense at all, you would print it.\" He said \"That's correct.\" It's next to impossible to buck the establishment and their conceit that they know everything. The Peter Priciple lives on. There is no such thing as an unbiased peer with- out an ego or not concerned with his standing within his peer group. He is very much aware of what is politically correct and incorrect, and surely doesn't want to be ridi- culed by his peers, even if he knows that current thinking is wrong and that a new theory makes good sense. That would be treading on very thin ice for him in his career. As for the opinion of competitors in the same field, that's another whole story. It's much safer for a peer to say no than to go out on a limb on a questionable idea. It might be a better idea to request an analysis by experts, especially in this field, and allow them to do their research anonymously. It's the re- sults that must make sense. -Alan L. Hausman, 9883 S.E. Osprey Pont Drive, Hobe Sound, FL 33455 772-545-4160 ahausman@adelphia.net Who controls research? The article \"Scientists say UFOs worthy of Serious Study\" reminded me of President Eisenhower's Farewell Address of January 1961. Not his famous remark warn- ing of a \"military-industrial complex,\" but one I think is much more pertinent to UFO research and its relation- ship to the scientific community. The outgoing President observed: \"Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in labora- tories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a sub- stitute for intellectual curiosity. \"For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project al- locations, and the power of money is everpresent-and is gravely to be regarded.\" By this quotation I do not mean to suggest that the government is forbidding or controlling academic research into the UFO phenomenon. This would be unnecessary in an atmosphere where institutional standing, funding, and publication are more important than \"intellectual curios- ity\" of subject matter that might inculcate embarrassment. —Brian Parks, Torrance, CA The Ramey document study It is gratifying to see (Journal, March 2003) that a good many people are still directing considerable effort toward the decipherment of the now famous Ramey Memo. As someone who has spent several years work- ing on this project, I feel certain that it will continue to provide mystery and controversy for years to come, in spite of the fact that (as David Rudiak and others so aptly observe) we all agree on enough of the salient points to make the memo a \"smoking gun.\" What bothers me about all this is not so much the spe- cific points on which we researchers disagree, though these are troublesome enough. I do continue to stick by my reading of \"CARLSBAD\" in line 5, as the -ARLS at the very least is exceedingly clear in my best images, and as the character group is demonstrably eight characters long, not seven as Rudiak maintains. As I have elsewhere pointed out, the teletype machine that produced this TWX has at least two identifiable pe- culiarities-it sometimes strikes \"D\" below the line, as at the end of'CARLSBAD,\" and it quite often strikes \"E\" right-of-field. And I continue to maintain that, the signature-line is very obviously six characters long (the fifth character clearly being \"L\") and reads TEMPLE; indeed this is vis- ible, in some images, from across the room, which, by the way, can be the best way to read the memo. Looking at the quality of images I have produced, one finds it incon- ceivable that the signature is \"RAMEY.\" And circumstantially speaking, Gen. Ramey could be holding a copy of a message that he had himself signed and sent to someone, but it's much more likely that in this case he would already simply have ordered an underling to file it. Most likely, this is a TWX to him from someone else. As I explain in my book The Golden Age of UFOs, a witness once claimed to me that at SAC Headquarters many years ago he had often seen messages signed \"Temple\" cross his desk, and they were from the office of FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover. When I asked the FBI, via FOIA, whether this had indeed been a code name for Hoover, they gave me a \"we can neither affirm nor deny\" response. But what bothers me more about current research on the Ramey memo is the widespread and mistaken notion that extreme magnification is the best approach. Not only is it not the best approach, but it can be, and has been, May 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"misleading. I have, among over a thousand images of the memo, one image printout that is only three quarters of an inch high by two inches long, and with the aid of a good magnifying glass I find it to be probably the most lucid image I've ever seen, high in resolutional clarity and re- freshingly free of imaging artifacts and ghost patterns. Indeed the problem with extreme magnification is pre- cisely that it inevitably produces effects that are only ar- tifacts of photo-image processing itself and not anything intrinsically belonging to the original memo in the Ramey-Dubose photo. In my best high-resolution images it is quite clear that beyond a certain level of magnification one encounters random-noise fields of light and dark-tiny fields which appear to contain \"patterns\" interpretable in any way one might imagine. I have produced a typical example. (I'm not sure whether this image can be reproduced here.) One may easily trace, among these patches of light and dark, the words MOON DUST. Now, before anyone gets excited about this, let me disclose the secret (besides the fact that 1947 was probably too early for Project Moon Dust)- this field of imagery in the memo is taken smack in the middle of General Ramey's thumb! In fact, I will here and now issue the following chal- lenge. If you will allow me to duck and weave among the \"patterns\" of light and dark at an extreme level of magni- fication, and if you will specify any line of poetry you would like, I will (guaranteed) go to the photo and \"find\" your line of poetry in Ramey's thumb and publish the re- sult. In saying these things, I do not mean to minimize anyone's work on the memo, as I think all investigators have done admirable work. I mean only to point out that we are all dealing with an exceedingly difficult problem fraught with the danger of being misled. I am convinced, having examined many hundreds of images over a period of several years, that the \"basic text\" visible in the memo is all there really is. Some have claimed to see pencil-marks at the bottom, esoteric routing data in the corner, etc., but in the best images I have produced-and I have used some of the best imaging software on the planet-there is nothing of the sort visible on the memo. (Also, nothing of the sort is visible on large glossy photos made directly from the nega- tive.) Rather than chasing ghosts and seeing the face of Elvis in the cracks in the wall, one is better off simply trying to read the words. That's certainly what I, for one, plan to continue trying to do. -Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D., State Director, New Mexico MUFON, Roswell, MM Validating the Ramey letter-an idea I thought the subject article in the March MUFON UFO Journal was fascinating. There were some meth- ods suggested for arriving at a consensus on the more muddy sections of the Ramey Message photographs. I was thinking that it might be interesting to go from a different direction. That is, why not create documents with similar char- acteristics to the Ramey message, in terms of type size and font, even perhaps using old typewriters (there must still be some around!). Type in a number of words that have been found in Ramey (such as disc or disk and vic- tims, wreck, etc.) and others that would be expected if it were the smoking gun, as well as other words that have nothing to do with the problem at all. Actually, I think some words that are similar (discuss vs disc, meeting vs needing/needed) to the smoking gun words should be included as well. Then try to set the test documents in approximately the same position and dis- tance from the camera as the Ramey message and sim- ply photograph them. It might even be necessary to use older camera equipment. That way, it might be possible to decipher the Ramey message by comparing the fuzzy appearance of the known words to the Ramey message. I certainly would feel honored if I could contribute to this effort. Thank you for your consideration of my idea. -Mary Marrs Rudiak replies Mary, Your suggestion has also been suggested by others, including a number of skeptics. The main problem I have with the proposal concerns standardization. How does one standardize readability to make something \"equally\" readable or unreadable? Also, how does one standardize context? Reading random messages is not the same as reading a message imbued in a well-understood historical con- text. Ambiguity in reading can only be dealt with in know- ing the proper context and knowing a great deal about the circumstances around the message. Allow me to give you an example from a recent TV show. On the fictional program about the CIA, \"The Agency,\" the CIA was trying to get leads on a domestic terrorist. He had been caught on a surveillance camera talking to one of his dupes, but the image was of poor quality and there was no audio. So they brought in a \"lip-reader,\" who immediately corrected them and said they preferred to be called \"lan- guage readers\" rather than \"lip readers\" because they were interepreting lip positions based on context, not di- rectly reading them. Then she gave examples of how different phrases could produce the same lip positions (another example of language ambiguity), and she required knowing something about the circumstances around the video if she was to properly interpret the lip motions. Thus with some reluctance, they told her what they Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal May 2003"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"thought the converstation was likely to be abput-he was a terrorist likely conveying instructions on the next bomb- ing he was planning. The same would have to be done in any testing situa- tion. Context is essential to proper readings when the text is lousy enough to produce ambiguity. A good deal of my Journal article was devoted to exactly this point and how Randle and Houran still didn't get it. Another problem I have with these proposals is that only negative results would be considered evidentiary. If I were to pass any tests with flying colors, that still would not be considered as corroboration that my reading of the Ramey message was likely correct. But if I were to fail such tests, then it would be immediately be jumped on as conclusive evidence that my reading was imaginary. It's a typical no-win situation, the same sort Randle and Houran were setting up in their first paper. Positive results by independent readers were worthless as evi- dence, in their opinion, whereas negative results should be accepted as invalidating the readings. It's hypocriti- cal, I know, but that is what would likely happen. Furthermore, what would be considered a passing grade on such a test? I suspect that even if I got 70% or 80% or even 90% of the words in such a test correct, it either would be arbitrarily defined by skeptics as a fail- ure, that the reliability of the reading wasn't high enough, or maybe that success on the test did not necessarily trans- late to success in correct reading the Ramey memo. My bitter experience in this field is that standards of evidence are always set ridiculously if not impossibly high by the skeptics. And even if one succeeds in meeting them, then the standard immediately changes-the old mov- ing goalpost dilemma. I might also add that nobody has ever proposed paying me for my time. I probably spent,around 200 hours on the Ramey message alone, and will be spending more time on it. Hundreds if not thousands of hours have been spent over nearly 10 years learning about the Roswell case in great detail. In short, a great deal of my time has been spent on just the Ramey message. Not only would it be difficult to recreate a similar situ- ation as the Ramey message, there is also no motivation on my part to partake in such a test. It would be nothing but a big time sink. I'm apparently expected to partici- pate in such a test without pay and with no personal benefit. If I \"pass\" (however that would be defined, probably very narrowly), it will likely be ignored, but if I \"fail\" (probably broadly defined), I'll never hear the end of it. These are the various reasons that I am not interested in such testing. I think there are much better ways to validate reading of the Ramey message. -David Rudiak Photos needed The MUFON UFO Journal welcomes photos from MUFON meetings and other events.

(Continued from page 8) ball.\" In spite of the fame which she has received, the ab- duction event is a small part of Betty's history. Betty was a child welfare worker in New Hampshire, and retired from a supervisory position after working for years for the state. Betty raised several children that she'd adopted while working and being a wife. Her father was a mayor, and her mother was very progressive for her time. Betty and Barney's interracial marriage was unique for its day, but they were valued members of their com- munity, and it was never an issue to them or others. They loved and lived full lives built on mutual respect for each other in the service of others. Betty has always held strong political views, and has been involved in politics, as well as other organizations that were designed to help the less fortunate. Barney was employed with the postal service after being in the military. He was equally busy working after-hours with civil rights, integration, his church, Community Action, and other projects. They were solid citizens and gave back to their com- munity more than most. These were people who had both feet on the ground. They were not a couple of loose camions with pie in the sky dreams or fantasies. If the truth be told, she would love to be known when she is gone as one of New Hampshire's finest child wel- fare workers, rather than Betty Hill of UFO fame. It was a job she took very seriously as she worked for many years protecting children. Betty has a great love of people, and I believe that is what makes her so open and friendly to all she meets. She has her opinions, as we all do, and they are held as firmly as her New England accent. Betty is extremely bright and quite articulate. A reflection of those qualities shows up in her ability to laugh. She has a warm and heartfelt laugh that she doesn't mind directing at herself when the occasion arises Betty and I went over her history, spanning the time period before, during, and after her abduction. When Barney died in February of 1976, Betty believed interest in them and their abduction would end. It did not. For years Betty traveled around the globe, going to Russia, South America, and many other places. She spent a good deal of time lecturing and doing TV spots, talking about the 1961 abduction incident. She gave telephone interviews, sometimes more than 120 in a month's time. Betty retired from the UFO community in September of 1991, her thirty-year anniversary of the abduction. She has never regretted her decision to do so. She has lived a very full life and gave much of herself over the years to traveling, lecturing, and documenting sightings. She was, as she says, \"ready to retire\" and become like one of the local tourists in her home state, lying on the beach and boating. Betty very quietly and unceremoniously slipped away from public view. But she never quite made it into that (Continued on page 16) May 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"FILER'S FILES By George A.

UFO the size of a car reported in Scotland BUCKHAVEN FIFE — On March 30, 2003, at 3:30 PM, when the witness was digging the vegetable plot an object about the size of a car came out from behind houses across the road. He yelled \"UFO,\" and got his partner to watch it as he ran for his camera. The object, which was about 100. feet away, looked oval, approximately 8 by 12 feet wide, with an under- neath part which revolved and had a pink/red flashing light. It looked tatty, black, and the two ends of the oval almost flapped like the fins of a manta ray would move. The witness reports, \"It was a clumsy looking object and just seemed to float. I went out my front door with the camera, but the ob- ject was a dot in the sky by then. I started clicking anyway. \"For that couple of minutes there was no traffic and the street seemed quiet. I ran across to the neighbor's house and watched it with two more people. One of them said it was a kid's balloon because he could see the string. He'd only been watching it for a minute, and had rushed out- side for a look when he saw me running with my camera. I didn't tell him it came out from the side of his house, and that it was the size of a car when I first saw it. It was not a kid's balloon.\" Light seems to move through auto in England FAKENHAM, NORFOLK — The witness reports, \"As my friend and I were navigating some sharp bends in the road on March 9, 2003, at 9:15 PM, we saw a large bright red light about 100 feet in the air. It was traveling slowly across the sky about a mile away, stopped, and then seemed to dive to the earth, changing its shape to a cylindrical form. \"It was about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide. The light seemed to quiver, but kept its shape, and disappeared when it reached the ground. The light was a very rich red set against the dark night, and was clearly visible. As we traveled two miles further along the road, my friend saw a rod-shaped light of white/electric blue fly across the field to our left and hover on the road about 18 inches above the ground. \"This object was about 20 inches long. It appeared to be extremely vibrant and was clearly seen. It was mo- tionless on the road when I (the driver) saw it, and we seemed to drive straight through it. My friend saw the inside of the car momentarily light up as we did so. This sparked off a great deal of thought and discussion be- tween us. We saw no further events the rest of the jour- ney, and we were none the worse for our experience.\" Father of space age says UFOs exist I recently gave a quote attributed to Professor Herman Oberth, father of the space age, stating, \"We find Our- selves faced by powers which are far stronger than we had hitherto assumed, and whose base is at present un- known to us..!\" Although he said something similar to this in an interview with MUFON's Antonio Huneeus, I was unable to reach Antonio to verify the exact quote. Oberth specifically stated for publication, \"It is my the- sis that flying saucers are real and that they are space- ships from another solar system. I think that they possi- bly are manned by intelligent observers who are mem- bers of a race that may have been investigating our earth for centuries. I think that they possibly have been sent out to conduct systematic, long-range investigations, first of men, animals, vegetation and more recently of atomic centers, armaments and centers of armament production.\" (\"Flying Saucers Come from a Distant World,\" The Ameri- can Weekly, October 24, 1954. In Paris Flammond's book UFO Exist!, Dr. Oberth is quoted as saying, \"These objects (UFO) are conceived and directed by intelligent beings of a very high order. They do not originate in our solar system, perhaps not in our galaxy.\" (From a press conference in Innsbruck, Aus- tria, June 1954.) Ole Henningsen writes from Denmark, \"Professor Hermann Oberth was a strong believer in UFOs = space- ships, and he attended UFO conferences and held lec- tures about his belief. I personally heard two of his lec- tures, one in 1966 in Denmark arranged by SUFOI, and one in Germany in 1967 arranged by Karl L. Veil. Close to Nueremberg, Germany, there is a museum devoted to him and his 'rocket-life.' \"According to my files, Hermann Oberth stated (trans- lated from his Danish lecture manuscript dated May 1, 1966): 'Regarding the UFOs, there is only one explana- tion, which until now has not been refuted, namely the Major Keyhoe hypothesis that UFOs are spaceships from other planets.' \"But he always in his lectures strongly supported a scientific approach to the UFO-phenomenon. His first appearance with a UFO lecture was at the DUIST con- ference in Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1960, as far as I know. \"He died on Dec. 29, 1989, at the age of 95.

I felt some sense of security as I had two passengers with me. My sister-in-law yelled outj 'Pull over, are those police lights?'

Not more than five minutes passed when I had the feeling that I had blinked out, and was back on the swing in a millisecond. As I sat wondering, I realized our conversation had suddenly stopped, and above our heads something was starting to illuminate. \"About 600 feet above us was a disk-shaped craft the size of a dish plate at arm's length. It was motionless, but the perimeter was illuminated by a faint blue light that appeared to come from the top center. The light started to brighten as if turned by a rheostat. \"As the light around the perimeter brightened, the craft started to slowly rotate up to the southwest, and as it rotated the light glow was changing from blue to a bright orange red. The glow of the light was like a source of May 2003 energy as opposed to illumination. It sat motionless for about ten seconds, then shot into the sky and disappeared among the stars in a split second. \"While I tried to grasp the wonder of what just hap- pened, my girlfriend started crying hysterically and jumped out of the swing. She cried, 'We just saw a flying sau- cer! ' She insisted we call the Miami Herald to report it, but there had been no other reports. \"Just then her parents came home, and we told them the story. They acted like I had drugged their daughter, and looking at the clock they suggested I leave, because it was after midnight. We had three hours of unexplained missing time.

While this is basically a biography of one man, it is also an intriguing behind- the-scenes look at ufology's key players and events of the 1960's, told as only a veteran ufologist could tell it. Readers will encounter not only Jacques Vallee, who wrote the introduc- tion to this book, but also such movers and shakers as Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dick Hall. Donald Keyhoe, Dr. Robert Wood, and Ray Fowler, as well as \"bunkers\" Phil Klass and Donald Menzel. The author has been a respected in- vestigator for 43 years, and became ac- quainted with McDonald while working with the National Investigations Commit- tee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). She has written nearly 200 articles for magazines, co- authored Tujunga Canyon Contacts, and is the author of How to Defend Yourself Against Alien Abductions. Ann has been in demand as a speaker for many years, and spoke at the MUFON symposium in 2001. This is a very large book, filled with material never before published, and there is no way that this review can do it justice. Ann has had access to McDonald's private archives, including his several \"diaries\" (four handwritten journals), and these have proven to be full of material of unusual interest. McDonald, whose specialty was atmospheric physics, established the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Arizona through the University of Chicago in 1954. A former teacher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and with experience in Naval intel- ligence, he was one of the most respected scientists of the 1950'sand 1960's. After at least eight years of studying UFOs privately, he went public with these studies in 1966, hoping that his prestige would encourage other scientists to come for- ward. He found, however, that this was not going to oc- cur, and that, from 1969 on, his own reputation was going to be tarnished in the eyes of most mainstream scientists. He was particularly upset with Hynek, who seemed to always hold back in expressing positive views regarding UFOs-at least during the time McDonald was trying to gain support from scientific colleagues. McDonald's wife Betsy was concerned with his increasing interest in UFOs, knowing that nothing would stop him from pursuing this subject the same way he pursued anything he considered a scientific mystery-intensely and fearlessly. McDonald was concerned, however, that he might be stepping into an area involving government security, and asked an associate to check this out. The associate re- ported that there was apparently no security tie-in. McDonald also was cautious enough to hedge a bit when asked what he thought UFOs might be, saying, \"The extraterrestrial hypothesis is, at present to my mind, the least unlikely.\" He made what appears to be an error in judgement while on a trip in 1966 to Australia which was funded by the Office of Naval Re- search (OCR). Operating in his spare time after normal working hours, he ap- peared on Australian media and criticized the Air Force and CIA work on UFOs, setting off a storm of criticism, including what was to become a virtual vendetta by Phil Klass, the anti-UFO editor of Aviation Week & Space Technology Magazine. McDonald eventually responded to the attacks by Klass by pointing out how Klass' theories regarding ball lightning and other topics lacked scientific validity. NASA had been funding McDonald with a small ($1300) grant which had al- lowed him to pay for part of his UFO stud- ies, but he apparently killed his chance for a renewal in 1968 when he spoke before the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) on the topic, \"Are UFOs Extraterrestrial Surveillance Craft?\" He summarized his opinion by saying, \"I should find it hard to choose between the safer answer, 'possibly,' and the riskier answer that actually comes closer to my present opinion, 'probably.' The ever-increasing weight of the evidence I have been examining would drive me to the latter answer, if I had to compress an hour's remark into a single word.\" McDonald was fascinated with the Socorro, NM, case involving Lonnie Zamora, working with other research- ers and visiting the site himself. The Socorro case is the only landing trace/occupant case listed by Project Blue Book as \"unidentified.\" Although McDonald was not intimately involved, the collapse of NICAP affected the entire ufological com- munity. Did the CIA engineer NICAP's demise? Druffel provides an interesting and informative account of NICAP's infighting and financial problems, as well as pos- sible CIA involvement. By 1970 McDonald's extensive time away from his wife and six children was taking a toll on his personal life, and he was frequently involved in trying to \"patch things up.\" Friends seemed to notice subtle changes in his per- sonality, but he continued both his atmospheric research and his UFO research. One of his projects involved the May 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"effects of supersonic transport (SST) fleets on the atmo- sphere, and he warned that the ozone layer could be dam- aged beyond its ability to repair itself. This could result in, among.other things, an increase in skin cancer. On-the UFO front, McDonald indicated he had been contacted by government officials in positions so high that he could not reveal who they were. This seemed to excite him, but also make him uncomfortable, because he felt he was being separated from colleagues. Meeting with Dr. Robert Wood, he said he thought he had figured out what UFOs are. \"You won't believe it,\" McDonald told Wood. But that was as far as he would go. Wood speculates that McDonald had found classified documents which involved a recovered craft. In a hearing before Congress on the possible effects of the supersonic transport, some members of the commit- tee brought up McDonald's work on UFOs, publicly ridi- culing his research. In addition, he had apparently just learned he would not receive funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to research UFOs. From being upbeat with Wood a few weeks earlier, McDonald was now depressed. Friends noted that he was not the \"ball of fire\" they had known over the years, although he continued his University of Arizona teaching duties, as well as his research obligations. He also began to study firestorms, the violent explo- sions which occur within intense heat concentrations, such as forest fires. But McDonald's domestic problems were about to catch up with him at a time he was not equipped to handle them. In March of 1971, Betsy asked for a divorce. He found her request \"all too painfully understandable.\" He sank into full depression, and began to plan his suicide. Even in the midst of this crisis, MacDonald worried about what would happen to his extensive UFO files, hop- ing they could be archived in the University of Arizona library. He also expressed hope that the book he had intended to write could be written by \"someone with roughly my combination of background and concerns\" who \"could squeeze out...of my files the full dimensions of USAF's incredible handling of the UFO problem.\" He left his UFO files in order and arranged most of them alphabetically in three cabinets, along with his ex- tensive library of UFO reference works. He did not im- mediately carry out his suicide plans, finishing papers he felt obligated to complete. However, on April 9 he put a pistol to his head and fired, missing the brain and hitting an optic nerve, which blinded him. Divorce plans were postponed as Betsy at- tended to his recovery. He resumed his work, returning to his office in June, analyzing how he could still be pro- ductive without his sight. He was told by doctors that some of his sight might return in two months' time. On June 12, however, Betsy sent one of their daugh- ters to pick him up at his office instead of going herself as promised. Her male friend had persuaded her she needed a rest. Hopes of reconciliation with Betsy were now gone. On June 12 McDonald went into a desert area, and his body was found the next day. One of the brightest atmospheric physics scientists of all time was dead in the prime of his life, and ufology lost one of its best researchers and advocates. My review copy of this book does not have an index, but I have been assured that the 640-page finished ver- sion of the book, set for release May 15, will have one. Firestorm is highly recommended.

(Continued from page 11) retirement. Now and then, as with the MUFON sympo- sium, she returns for a brief moment and then slips back into the background, tending to her brood of chickens, cat, and flower beds at home. Betty is more apt to talk these days about local or glo- bal politics. Tracing her roots and genealogy is a pastime she loves to do and discuss. She knows she has lived a charmed life, meeting as- tronauts, scientists, and celebrities along the way. She has woven into her somewhat controversial life a net- work of good friends whom she views as extended fam- ily. The telling and retelling of her story has allowed her to be on television around the world, even Chinese televi- sion, and has afforded her the luxury of traveling to many far-away places. She has lived the good life and worked hard to preserve her privacy when need be. She is in good health and spirits, but is tired of telling her story of being abducted, saying \"it's boring.\" She has moved on, and so have we; but every now and then she returns to us. Many people know of Betty Hill and her abduction experience, but not many know of the fifteen years she spent going out in the local community with a handpicked group of people to investigate and document sightings. Included in her group were high ranking military officials, medical doctors, police, associated press, television cam- eramen, scientists, teachers, and a priest. She has a col- lection of slides of UFOs that were made from the pic- tures taken over the years. She still has her dress that she was wearing the night of the abduction. Each time I see the dress, there is a little less of it to see, as samples are taken and sent off to be analyzed in labs around the world. As of today, the results are inconclusive regarding the pink powdery sub- stance that stained the dress. The dress is kept in a bag, but every now and then she will bring it out for review. She has the star map which she drew under post-hyp- notic suggestion still vividly ingrained in her mind. Marjorie Fish brought the star map to fame when she made a model featuring it. Other than the remembering of that map, Betty was left with no clues or information as to where the alien visitors came from, or any information about them or their civilization. Now, Zeta Reticuli is often re- ferred to as a possible home of our alien visitors, based on the map.

Britain probably has more UFO skeptics per square mile than most other countries, and recently I was talk- ing to one, a psychologist who has dabbled in a few in- vestigations. What, I wanted to know, would persuade him that UFOs are real? \"In what sense?\" was his first counter. Psychologists love to answer questions with another question, I have no- ticed. It is as if what matters can only be what you tell them, not what they dare to reveal about themselves. I resisted the temptation of mentioning aliens. I have learnt of old (from a battle in a uni- versity debate with an as- tronomer) that they want to disprove the possibility that UFOs are alien spaceships, and are delighted if you equate the two, allowing them to disprove spaceships and think they have disproven UFOs as well. Do not fall into the trap of regarding UFOs and alien craft as synony- mous. \"Merely that some UFOs exist,\" I replied. \"Phenom- ena that might add something new to our understanding of science. Something that cannot be adequately explained by a combination of misperception, hoaxing or delusion. Something real and unidentified.\" \"Ah,\" came the reply, with a short but telling pause. I knew I had hit the soft spot. Evidence After a careful consideration 1 was told by my skepti- cal nemesis that it all comes down to evidence. We need some. \"But there is plenty,\" I responded. \"What sort of evi- dence do you seek?\" \"Well, not witness testimony, that is for sure,\" came the reply. \"As a psychologist I am afraid I have to tell you that what someone says that they have seen is very rarely commensurate with what they actually have seen. Per- ception is riddled with cognitive difficulties. This, you see, is why UFO evidence falls apart. It relies on human be- ings and they are just not reliable.\" As I explained, I was very familiar with the fallibility of witness testimony. Nobody who had spent 25 years interviewing thousands of witnesses possibly could fail to be. I would never base any conclusions about UFOs merely on witness testimony-although I would certainly not be entirely so dismissive of cases where multiple wit- nesses, some of scientific training or observational expe- rience, all support basically the same type of phenom- enon. \"We have cases with consistent threads all over the world, such as car stop events where the same processes seem to be being described again and again. But, no matter, what else would convince you?\" Proof \"Well, of course,\" he began again, \"there is no proof.\" I finally elicited that proof meant tangible evidence- the sort of thing that scientists could look into in a labora- tory. \"There is such a thing,\" I replied. \"Indeed I have worked with quite a few scientists who have studied it in their laboratory, although I have come across one or two who simply would not do this for fear of being laughed at by colleagues. Science seems to require that you state pub- licly that you will study any evidence of UFOs, should it ever be made available-provided, of course, that such a promise never actully has to be carried out.\" After a bit of a harrumph in reply, I was told that, pre- sumably, the evidence that was studied all turned out to be bogus. \"Not at all,\" I could honestly say. \"Fake evidence is extremely uncommon. Often, of course, as with photo- graphs, the true cause of the image is revealed. Labora- tory tests have helped crack puzzling cases and solve UFO events for which hard evidence was available-and I am delighted, because that is what investigating UFOs is all about. But there have been one or two instances where the true explanation for what is on the film has not been revealed, despite much laboratory analysis.\" \"Ah, yes, but given more time, money, effort or what- ever it would have been, wouldn't it?\" \"How do you know? I asked, intrigued by this appar- ent certainty. \"Because otherwise it would have stayed a UFO.\" Indeed, I thought, and there is the rub. Proof of a UFO is only acceptable to a skeptic provided that it proves that the UFO really isn't one. Anything that fails to be re- solved is just proof waiting to be explained away at some point in the future. Even though on such a basis the moon could be made out of cheese because, whilst I cannot prove this as yet, eventually no doubt some evidence will come to light to let me do so. Wither skepticism? So, I pondered. If witness testimony or photographs will never come up to scratch, what would? Well, the skeptic wandered aimlessly into the trap, \"I May 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"guess, if I saw one.\" \"But would that not be another example of witness testimony, equally unreliable? \"Perhaps...\" \"And, if you took a photo, would that also not eventu- ally be explained away by other experts, since, of course, it could not really show a UFO?\" \"One would hope so. I would want the truth to be re- vealed.\" \"Arid, if we created some totally automated system to record scientifc data from a UFO hot spot-taking images from multiple cameras, recording spectroscopic emissions, revealing what the make up of the UFO was-all without the need for fallible witness testimony? Would that be acceptable to a skeptic once we established hard, physi- cal evidence for the nature of this particular type of UFO? \"Yes...and no.\" \"How so?\" \"Yes, because the evidence could be scientifically stud- ied in a laboratory, and we might discover what it was. No, because, even if that something was new to science then we would, of course, have identified it, so, naturally, it could not be called a UFO.\" \"Indeed,\" I agreed, \"but that is exactly what I was arguing. UFOlogy exists to investigate cases, find out if any describe something new to science, and seeks to ex- plain what these might be, if indeed such novel phenom- ena do exist. Our job is to find answers, not perpetuate mysteries.\" \"No, you said you were a UFOlogist, and once you have evidence of something that is a novel scientific phe- nomenon then that belongs to the field of physics, or me- teorology, or whatever branch of science best describes it. You are seeking UFOs, and these cannot exist, be- cause everything must eventually be explained in some scientific manner.\" Coda I gave up at this point, because it serves no purpose to debate such logic. UFOs mean one thing to me and an- other to a skeptic, and I do not see how the twain shall ever meet. If a UFO is only a UFO until we prove that it is real, then when it becomes an IFO, however novel its origin, we are doomed to forever chase our own tails, handing it over to its true parents- parents who, of course, will have denied the child was theirs until that day. But, frankly, who cares. I think I know who has the most chance of discovering something interesting, and the skeptical way of doing things seems only doomed to lead to obfuscation. Still, if it makes them happy....

(Continued from page 16) She has a bust of the lender that she and Marjorie worked on many years ago. Junior, the name the local school children gave to the peculiar green/gray alien, sits retired in the bedroom on a mantel. Not many people know that on the night she was ab- ducted, Betty was also wearing a pair of blue earrings that ended up missing. Many months later when she and Barney returned home from a visit to the White Moun- tains, they found a pile of leaves on their kitchen table. Brushing away the leaves, they discovered the blue ear- rings there. They knew that the aliens knew where they lived. Some time later, a neighbor told them that he saw two men in black enter the house and did not react of think it strange as Betty and Barney had strangers visit quite of- ten. Leaving the doors unlocked was something you did back then, so the neighbor did not think it was suspect to see them enter, believing Betty and Barney were home. Betty told of having a needle in the navel during the abduction, and being told it was a pregnancy test. Betty said there was no such pregnancy test back then in 1961, but afterwards doctors did develop the \"needle in the na- vel\" pregnancy test. Betty made an appearance on F.Lee Bailey's TV show and took a lie detector test which she passed. She under- went a brain scan to look for anomalies, and passed with flying colors. The best proof of her abduction is Betty herself. Her story is now 42 years old, and she has never wavered from it in any part. She holds fast to the validity of the event and, knowing Betty, one is immediately struck by her persona of being a woman of truthfulness and of being very grounded, exhibiting a no-nonsense approach to life. Betty says she has had numerous sightings over the years around her home. As she and Barney were return- ing from local events, it was not unusual for them to be paced by a UFO. Betty has sat out on her back steps and seen them over the house and the trees in her back yard. She is friendly and not afraid, and she believes this has a lot to do with all the sightings she has witnessed over the years. Betty talks about her experiences as casually as we might talk about going to the store or seeing a meteor streak across the night sky. I asked Betty one time many years ago, \"Why is it that you are able to see so many UFOs, and the rest of us will be lucky to see one in our lifetime?\" She replied, \"What do you see when you look up at the sky?\" I answered, \"Stars.\" \"Then all you will ever see is stars,\" she advised. That brief statement has stuck with me throughout the years, and at times I think it must mean something, but I'll be darned if I know what it is. It was not unusual for her to be contacted by someone local telling her they saw a UFO come down in broad daylight and land in their backyard. There were reports of families gathered in their living rooms watching TV (Continued on page 21) Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal May 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PERCEPTIONS By Stanton T. Friedman Stanlon T. Friedman James McDonald For more than 30 years I have been touting the out- standing UFO research of the late Dr. James E. McDonald (May 7, 1920—June 12, 1971). Jim was a professor of physics in the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He was an outstanding scientist who looked in depth at every scientific problem that caught his attention, which cov- ered a great deal of ground in- deed. Between 1960 and his death in 1971, he interviewed more than 500 UFO witnesses, made pre- sentations about UFOs to a host of professional groups from coast to coast and in Australia, wrote a number of papers, and provided inspiration to APRO and espe- cially to NICAP. His dogged persistence in not only tracking down witnesses, but using the methods of science to destroy the foolish \"explanations\" put forth by Dr. Donald Menzel, Philip Klass, and others, should provide a model for all those seeking the truth about flying saucers. Finally there has been a book published that thoroughly explores his UFO activities. Ann Druffel, herself a long time UFO researcher in the Los Angeles area, has authored a splendid book, Firestorm: Dr. James E. McDonald's Fight for UFO Science. The text alone covers 587 pages. With appendices and index, the total will be about 640 pages. Ann had full access to Jim's very voluminous and de- tailed files, and transcribed loads of notes. He was very well organized. Having had brief access to those files decades ago, with Richard Greenwell, I can testify to his extraordinary persistence and objectivity. Having met Jim several times when he met with our NICAP group in Pittsburgh, I can't find fault at all with Ann's portrayal of Jim McDonald the person, as well as Jim the scientist. He gave unstintingly of himself to all who sought assistance. It was Jim who was primarily responsible for the Hear- ings held by the House of Representatives Committee on Science and Astronautics on July 29,1968. The 246-page Proceedings of that Symposium are one of the five major scientific sources that I stress in my college lectures \"Fly- ing Saucers ARE Real,\" not because I contributed in writing, but because there is so much good material, es- pecially Jim's contribution. I consider his 71 -page paper the best single paper avail- able on excellent cases which were very well investi- gated. There are 41 different cases noted, including mul- tiple witness cases, radar/visual sightings, sightings over big cities, and sightings by astronomers, meteorologists, and pilots. His paper is available in an easier to read for- mat from UFORI, POB 958, Houlton, ME 04730-0958 for $10.00, including first class postage. One of the many themes running through Ann's book is the ongoing battle between Jim and Northwestern Uni- versity astronomer, (and Project Blue Book Science Con- sultant) J. Allen Hynek. Jim had visited Project Blue Book and was astonished to find how many excellent sightings had been swept under the rug or misidentified by Blue Book personnel and Hynek. He was upset that Allen had not alerted the scientific community to how much good information there was in the files, and how much poor investigation, intentional or not, had been done. Dr. Jacques Vallee, who wrote the foreword to Firestorm, was caught in the middle between the two. He was more or less Hynek's protege, but seemed to believe that more vigorous action could have been taken by Hynek. Hynek and McDonald had very different personalities and very different professional backgrounds. Jim was a very dynamic and thorough individual who went at all sci- entific problems quantitatively, using his very extensive knowledge of atmospheric physics to evaluate so called mirages, temperature inversions, ball lightning, atmospheric plasmas, etc, to demolish claims about these phenomena supposedly explaining UFO sightings, as put forth by Klass and Menzel. Allen rarely resorted to computations about these phe- nomena, and never seemed to want to learn a lot about them. I noticed the same problem when I tried to get him to look into the literature on interstellar travel. Much of it was by aerospace engineers. It is true that astronomers have almost always ne- glected aerospace engineering when \"investigating\" the possibility of space travel in general and interstellar travel in particular; they have almost always been totally wrong in their computations because of making absurd assump- tions. Ann discusses in detail Jim's fight against the SuperSonic Transport program in the 1960s. His focus was on the effect of the engine exhaust on the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere. The concern was that reducing the ozone layer would increase the level of ultraviolet radia- tion at the surface of the earth, and, therefore, would lead to an increase in skin cancer. There were, of course, aerospace companies and po- litical jurisdictions that were very much for the SST pro- gram because of the jobs it would create. Jim testified in depth at congressional hearings, and was ridiculed be- May 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"cause of his stand (falsely described by a congressman on the committee) about UFOs. He was right about the ozone. For economic reasons the UK-France consortium has recently announced that the Concorde SST will soon stop flying as well.   , . Jim had also appjjed quantitative computations to evalu- ating the impact on residents of Arizona cities if nuclear weapons were dropped on the missiles to be emplaced to protect them. He pointed out that with the prevailing winds of the area, the residents would have been exposed to much higher levels of fallout than would have occurred if the missiles had been on the other side of the cities. He thought science and the welfare of the people and the planet should take precedence over political considerations. Hynek seemed more concerned with keeping his con- sultant income for his Blue Book work than really doing something about UFOs. Part of the problem was he ap- parently needed the money to keep his children in univer- sity. Jim had 6 children, three of whom were also in col- lege, in the late 1960s, so this excuse for inaction carried little weight with him. Allen also seemed to feel that, by not making waves, he could keep his foot In the door. McDonald clearly felt that this not only accomplished little, but delayed the par- ticipation of many scientists who would have become in- volved, if they had known there were so many good cases needing investigation. Most of the scientific community apparently thought that with astronomers such as Hynek and Menzel not claiming there was much going on,, there was no point in even dipping their toes in the ufological waters. McDonald was understandably distressed when he fi- nally managed to obtain a copy of the Robertson Panel Report of 1953. He considered it a travesty, and Hynek's failure to do anything about it while there-or afterwards- incomprehensible. The unethical treatment of Jim by people like Phil Klass and Donald Menzel becomes obvious when reviewing how Klass was responsible for the Navy backing away from Jim's research contract (with the Office of Naval Re- search) on atmospheric physics. Jim had done yeoman work and published many papers in refereed scientific journals. Klass' misrepresentations about Jim and his work certainly make one wonder who Klass worked for. Ann talked to many of Jim's professional colleagues at the University of Arizona and elsewhere, as well as to people who had been at NICAP when Jim had greatly assisted Director Donald Keyhoe and associates, both in digging into cases and encouraging contributions from members and others. It is clear that the halls of academia are hardly a hot- bed of courageous professional people willing to risk sta- tus forgathering solid information. They sure worry about reputations and status, even if they have tenure. Ann notes that McDonnell-Douglas, a major government R and D and hardware supplier, also expressed concerns about possible public discussions, such as at the 1968 Congres- sional Hearings or the 1999 American Association for the Advancement of Science UFO Symposium by Dr. Robert M. Wood. I consider myself extremely lucky that Westinghouse Astronuclear, when asked by me for a policy statement about whether I could or could not lecture about flying saucers, responded so well. I was told that I could say whatever I pleased on my time, that I could state that I was a nuclear physicist employed by Westinghouse, and that I should begin each presentation with a disclaimer that the views they were about to hear were mine and not those of my employer. The company was also asked to send me on an ex- pense account to speak to the American Nuclear Society Chapter at Los Alamos National Laboratory and to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers chapter in Wilmington, Delaware. They did. Management had heard my lecture.    , Jim McDonald spoke to dozens of such professional groups and prepared detailed written presentations as well for many of them. They are extremely well done, loaded with solid information. He even allowed our group in Pitts- burgh to have 1000 copies of his paper \"UFOs: Most Challenging Scientific Problem of Our Time\" to be printed and sold for $1 to help raise funds for our answering ser- vice, newsletter, and investigations. We assembled it on the large conference table in the offices of one of Pittsburgh's largest accounting firms. Establishing credibility in the community was helped by people like Jim, who lent respectability so that the media came to us when the Condon Report was issued in Janu- ary of 1969. . KDKA, Pittsburgh's most powerful radio station, ac- tually told me they were getting an advance copy, and would give it to me if I would appear on their big talk show to discuss it. I agreed, not realizing the book was 963 pages long. The newspapers asked for our views as well, and treated them with respect. Speaking out care- fully, after having done one's homework can encourage the community to report sightings, and other scientists to come forth. Jim's technical group efforts certainly en- couraged many to take the subject more seriously. An important conflict within the book is the question of whether the government's totally inept Blue Book inves- tigations after Captain Edward Ruppelt's reign were just a foul-up by people who didn't care and were not scien- tific, or whether there was a cover-up. Ann indicates that, before his death, McDonald had finally come around to the position that there indeed was a cover-up, though he hadn't divulged whatever it was he found that led him to this conclusion. Ann tried, but was unable to determine what the information was. It should be noted that Jim did not have the benefit of the Freedom of Information Act to get at long covered up classified documents which, even though often very heavily censored with black ink or white-out, establish a cover-up. I wonder what he would have thought about USAF General Carrol IBolender's comment (20 October, 1969- obtained by Bob Todd a decade later) \"Reports of UFOs which could affect national security are made in accor- dance with JANAP 146 or Air Force Manual 55-11 and Page 20 MUFON UFO Journal May 2003"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"are not part of the Blue Book System.\" Ann deals very well with the real story of Jim's tragic death. I had done a quiet investigation of my own at that time after several people told me that the government must have killed Jim, and that I would be next. I spoke with Jim's wife, his daughter, and a colleague at U of A to get the facts. It was indeed suicide—an incredible loss to his family, the scientific community, and the world. He had been planning a book which would have cer- tainly done a lot to convince the press, the public, and the scientific community of the importance of the UFO prob- lem. It was outlined, apparently, but certainly never writ- ten.

Betty Hill: urology's grandmother... (Continued from page 18) who saw unearthly visitors peering in the windows watch- ing TV right along with them. One elderly couple report- edly became so unhinged that they sold their house out in the country and moved closer to town, nearer to people. Betty laughs, saying it was good luck for one of her fam- ily members, as her niece bought the home from the eld- erly couple. I asked Betty if she thought the beings she encoun- tered were biological or robotic in nature. She said they were real and not robotic. She said the beings she and Barney encountered were anywhere from 3 feet to 5 feet. They were not weak, skinny creatures; they were rug- ged. Each of the beings had a different face and personal- ity, just as if there were 11 different people together in a room. Again, she surprised me by saying, \"But...they do have a robot.\" It is some kind of robot they use that has a dark structure and a large orange head with wires run- ning through it. At one time she saw nine of them. Oth- ers in their silent UFO research group saw them as well. One sobering note came out in the interview. Betty believes that some of the beings that are seen with the aliens that are very human looking may be just that-hu- man. With all the child abductions, it would not be a stretch of the imagination to fathom that some of those humans had been taken as small children to live with their abduc- tors. Betty is just so dam used to having UFOs and aliens as a part of her life that she takes little interest in the gath- ered items she's collected and has stored away through- out her home. You would almost be tempted to think that some of the stories she tells are the ramblings of an 84- year-old woman who has a very vivid imagination or has lost touch with reality. But Betty is as solid as the granite rock that the state of New Hampshire itself sits upon. She is a no-nonsense kind of woman. Even in her advanced age she is quick- witted, agile, and has a good strong mind for dates, names, and facts. I for one would never want to have to come up against her in a court of law. She is that convincing. Betty became quiet at one point in the interview when she said to me, \"I'm the only one living. John Fuller is gone, Dr. Simon is gone, Barney's gone.\" I could feel her private memory tinged with sadness as she spoke. When I was last up to see Betty, another person of UFO notoriety had died. Norman Muscarello, of Exeter, died at the age of 55 on Feb. 26, 2003. Norman's UFO story was also penned by John Fuller in his book Incident at Exeter. Norman and Betty lived very close to each other and, although they did not know each other well, they knew each other. Only Betty is left now. Betty, the Grandmother of Ufology, remains as \"feisty\" as ever, living quietly among us. She will not be with us forever, but she and her story are the stuff of legends, and they will live on in history. May 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"\"Waiter N. Wetib 1 '•'-'. June 2003 Bright Planets (Evening Sky) Jupiter (magnitude -1.9), in Cancer, lies low in the W at dusk and sets about 11:30 PM in the WNW. Southern observers get a better view of the giant planet. Bright Planets (Morning Sky) Venus (-3.9) rises about 4 AM and remains very low in the.ENE at dawn. Mars enters Aquarius and nearly doubles its bright- ness during June, from -0.7 to -1.4 magnitude, as Earth heads toward an epic August rendezvous with its red-faced neighbor. The ruddy planet rises in the ESE about midnight (mid-June), climbing to the SSE at dawn. (From southern states, it rises earlier and reaches a much higher altitude.) Telescopic observers begin their Marswatch as the prime observing window opens late in the month. At that time the tiny Martian disk exceeds a diameter of 15 arc-seconds, permitting glimpses of planetary surface de- tail. On June 19 Mars lies about 2 degrees N of the gib- bous Moon. : Mars Landers To Be Launched This month three Mars spacecraft are scheduled for liftoff-two by the US, and one by the European Space Agency. Two Mars Exploration Rovers, launched sepa- rately atop Delta rockets, are being sent to two different locations on the planet. After landing on Mars next January, the robot explora- tion vehicles will roll across the surface, snapping color images of the terrain and analyzing rocks and soil samples for evidence of water in the planet's past. Europe's lander, called Beagle 2, arrives at Mars in December. Moon Phases: First quarter-June 7 Full moon-June 14 Last quarter-June 21 New moon-June 29 The Stars After the long twilight ends, a nose-diving Leo the Lion in the W signals the close of spring, while the summer sky symbol, the Summer Triangle, ascends in the opposite half of the heavens. In between, from W to E, are the. constellations of Bootes the Herdsman (its bright orange star Arcrurus), Virgo the Maiden (with the blue-white star Spica), Co- rona Borealis the Northern Crown, Libra the Scales, Her- cules the Kneeling Giant, Scorpius the Scorpion (with red star Antares), and Sagittarius the Archer. A rotating star guide, called a planisphere, helps im- mensely in recognizing the seasonal star patterns by time of night throughout the year. U of California experiment reveals new electrostatic rotation concepts In a discovery that is likely to impact fields as diverse as atomic physics, chemistry, and nanotechnology, re- searchers have identified a new physical phenomenon, electrostatic rotation, that, in the absence of friction, leads to spin. Scientists Anders Wistrom and Armik Khachatourian of the University of California, Riverside, first observed the electrostatic rotation in static experiments that consisted of three metal spheres suspended by thin metal wires, and published their observations in Applied Physics Letters. When a DC voltage was applied to the spheres they began to rotate until the stiffness of the suspending wires prevented further rotation. The observed electrostatic rotation was not expected, and could not be explained by available theory. For more than 200 years, researchers have known only about the push and pull of electric forces between objects with like or unlike charges. Wistrom and Khachatourian designed the study with concepts they had developed earlier. \"Experimental and theoretical work from our laboratory suggested that the cumulative effect of electric charges would be an asym- metric force if the charges sitting on the surface of spheres were asymmetrically distributed,\" said Wistrom. \"In the experiments, we could control the charge dis- tribution by controlling the relative position of the three spheres.\" Page 22 MUFON UFO Journal June 14 —International UFO Museum at Roswell, Paul Davids, producer of the movie \"Roswell.\" roswellufo@aol.com .
