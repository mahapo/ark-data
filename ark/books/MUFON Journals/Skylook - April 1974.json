Witness: John Meyer (Dispatcher, Shawnee, Kansas Police Department) John Meyer's Statement: John saw a very, very bright light in the southeastern sky at 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon. He watched it remain stationary for 45 minutes, then discontinued watching as he was on duty. It was a steady bright light. There was a slight overcast with no other stars visible. He had observed a yellow light close to the horizon at the same time. They have a police helicopter, and he is quite familiar with its appearance and lights. The Road Patrol was in contact with him by radio. They reported that the light moved southward, but John didn't see it disappear since he discontinued viewing it after 45 minutes. The Johnson County Sheriff's office in Olathe, Kan- sas, reported the same light to the Center for UFO Studies at 6:35 a. m., C.D.S.T.

Hosting this sym- posium will be the Flying Saucer Investigating Committee (FSIC) in Akron, and the Cleveland UFOlogy Project (CUP) at the Akron-Cascade Plaza Holiday Inn, 5 Cascade Plaza, Akron, Ohio 44308. Speakers for the Symposium and their subjects are: Ralph Blum, \"From Scoffer, to Skeptic, to Believer in Twelve Hectic Months\"; Walter H. Andrus, \"The Mutual UFO Network and Its Inter- face with the Center for UFO Studies\"; Ted Phil- lips, \"UFO Landing Case Traces\"; Rev. Barry H. Downing, Ph. D., \"Religion and UFO's: The Ex- trasensory Problem\"; Marjorie E. Fish, \"Journey Into the Hill Star Map\"; Berthold E. Schwarz, M.D., \"PSI, Saucers, and Psychiatry\"; and Stanton T. Friedman, \"Flying Saucers and Physics.\" Larry Moyers, MUFON State Director for Ohio, will introduce the speakers and the Mayor of Akron will deliver a short welcoming statement. Two additional papers will be published in the 1974 MUFON Symposium Proceedings along with the above listed prepared speeches. Stan Gordon, MUFON State Director for Pennsylvania, will share his study of \"The Possible Relationship of Crea- ture and UFO Sightings,\" and Eugene Burt, author of the book \"UFO's and Dlomgnetism\" and a science teacher in Memphis, Tenn., will explore his theory for the power source of UFO's. The Annual Corporate Meeting of the Mutual UFO Network is scheduled for Sunday, June 23, 1974, from 9 a. m. to 12 noon at the Holiday Inn in conjunction with the Symposium. Amateur Radio Operators are invited to aake advanced reserva- tions to attend the special luncheon Saturday noon for the MUFON NET with Dr. Willard P. Arm- strong, W0NC, presiding. Tentative plans are be- ing made for a workshop session Sunday afternoon dealing with the techniques of UFO field inves- tigations, moderated by Ron Westrum Ph. D., MUFON Consultant in Sociology. Ideas generated during this round-table discussion will be utilized in the preparation of the second.edition to MUFON'a \"Field Investigators' Manual.\" Hotel and motel accommodations in Akron will be arranged by the individual participants (ex- cept speakers) directly with the motel reserva- tions department. For the convenience of those attending, 180 rooms have already been \"blocked- off\" at the Akron-Cascade Holiday Inn for our Symposium attendees. Tour local Holiday Inn would be happy to make your reservations through their HOLIDEX Computer System and confirm in writing. The Holiday Inn Directory states that the regular. room price at the Akron-Cascade Plaza is $18 per night with either one or two beds for one person; $23 for two people for the same accommodations; Berthold Eric Schwarz, M.D. and ,$4 per night for each additional person oc- cupying the room. The Akron Convention Committee has volunteered their complete support to the MUFON Symposium which promises that the arrangements and services will be outstanding. Detailed ticket prices for the Symposium sessions and dinners were not available to meet the publishing deadline of this issue of SKYLOOK, but will appear in the May issue. There will again be a special \"package price\", for the entire . Symposium. The easing of the gas shortage is very encouraging, so make plans now to attend the 1974 MUFON UFO Symposium.

Allen Hynek of Northwestern University told an audience of about 150 on March 3 at Mc- Kendree College, Lebanon, 111., that interest in UFO'a is at an all-time high. Disclaiming any political allusions or in- sinuations, he observed that when one compares several recent Gallup polls, one sees that more people today believe in UFO's than believe in President Nixon. As he has done frequently, Dr. Hynek illus- trated his talk with slides and cartoons, point- ing out the persistent ridicule with which the cartoonists have approached the UFO phenomenon, and distinguishing six basic categories of UFO reports. Dr. Hynek mentioned one occupant report which apparently has not been publicized yet in any of the UFO literature, possibly because the witness- es have asked for anonymity. He also described this sighting in a speech made at Stanford Uni- versity in February. The sighting was as follows: \"This one occurred about two months ago in New Hampshire,\" said Dr. Hynek. \"This man and his wife had just gone to bed when the man saw a light coming under the door. He got up, turned the light off in the living room, and found that the living room was dark and the light was coming from the outside. He had a dog which was rather vicious. (In fact, when our investigator went there, the dog wouldn't let him through until he was called off.) The man went to the door, opened it, and found that the illumination was coming in from outside in the region of these .two creatures (a slide is projected on the screen showing a line drawing of two humahoids)i The dog rushed out, got half way to the creatures, stopped short, his hair bristled and stood on end, and he came cringing back to the house. And what do you suppose those creatures were doing? They were picking up rocks and putting them into a bag. This case had only two witnesses. It never hit the papers, and the people simply didn't want their names used at all.\" Dr. Hynek was quoted in a recent press release that he doesn't have a theory abcut what UFO's are. \"I don't necessarily believe that we are being visited,\" he said. In a recent issue of Family Weekly, Dr. Hynek was asked, \"When you were in charge of the Air Force's UFO inquiry, you rejected the existence of UFO's. Now you verify the experience of two men in Mississippi who say three creatures spirited them aboard a flying saucer. What gives?\" Dr. Hynek replied, !*I did examine these men under hypnosis, and have stated their experience was very real. I have not changed my mind about apace visitors. But I have changed my mind about UFO's being simple misper- ceptions of common things. I am now quite con- vinced that we do have a very real and as yet un- explained phenomenon going on. I believe people who report UFO's are sincere, and I, for one, cannot explain many of the things they describe. We must, however, remember that the \"U\" in UFO simply means \"unidentified\"—not necessarily vis- itors from outer space.\" Following his talk at McRendree College, he and MUFON secretary Ted Phillips answered questions from the audience. Concerning speculation regard- ing UFO's and the ETI (extraterrestrial intelli- gence) hypothesis, Dr. Hynek commented, \"UFO's are a real phenomenon, but this 'visitation from outside earth* may not be an explanation....Sup- pose—and I say this as pure imagination—suppose a thought-form can be projected elsewhere and have it materialize there—sort of 'beamed down* a la 'Star Trek'? Or, another possibility is: how do we know that the things that we see around us represent the sum total of our environment? May- be, as some mystics and other people have told us for centuries, there are other planes of exist- .-___ it ence.... When asked if he thinks the USAF or other gov- ernment agency is withholding information on UFO's, he replied, \"I would have to say that I think so. Because I know that while I was a part of Blue Book, there were a number of cases that never got into Blue Book.. that, as active as this sorts of Investigations, being touched by somebody.\" Bringing ,the evening to a close, Dr. Hynek men- tioned an upcoming NBC White Paper on UFO's, : which he is working on. It is to be aired in Sep- : tember in prime time, with Rod Serllng as the narrator. \"So at long last, I'm becoming a Holly- wood star,\" he quipped. \"We're getting some very Interesting things from NASA, and, believe it or not, from the Air Force as well. It's going to be a blockbuster.\" Dr. Hynek's book, \"The UFO Experience,\" which has become one of the most widely-accepted publi- cations on the subject, will be released in paperback in May by BalIantine.

Andrus Director, MUFON In the March, 1974, issue of SKYLOOK an expla- nation was presented on the \"Center for UFO Stud- ies,\" describing its objectives, functions, fa- cilities, and purpose. This article is a follow- up or continuation to explain how MUFON will in- terface with the Center. It would be advantageous for MUFON members to read the above-referenced article again, so as to better understand MUFON 1 s participation in this significant progressive step in resolving the UFO phenomena as the following actions, instructions, and philosophies unfold. The Center for UFO Studies is basically a re- search center without the benefits of 'an organ- ized field investigative network needed to secure the \"raw data.\" MUFON ideally fulfills this es- sential function and thus complements the Center. Dr. Hynek has frequently made the public state- ment that \"There is no place to report UFO sight- ings.\" His statement has been challenged on several occasions, because organized UFO groups have been assimilating reports from the public for over twenty years. It was brought to his at- tention by the Director of MUFON that, if he had said, \"There is no one place to report UFO sight- ings,\" his comment might be considered valid. Dr. Hynek's goal in life has been to establish a center where the estimated 90% of all UFO reports not now being reported and recorded would have an .outlet. As the \"laughter curtain\" and possibil- ity of ridicule disappear, it is imperative that private organizations provide ready access to the, public. MUFON is rapidly establishing a nationwide network that will fill the need for such services as competent and qualified personnel are located and trained. At the present time, MUFON has State Section Directors in thirty-eight (38) states of the fifty. There are still many areas which are not being adequately covered. If MUFON personnel have done a good public re- lations job In their home communities by cultiva- ting a close communication link with police agen- cies, the news media, and through public lec- tures, they will be automatically contacted or referred to when citizens report a UFO sighting. To date, the \"Enterprise\" toll-free nationwide telephone number has been made available by the Center to police agencies only. This, in itself, is a large step forward, since thousands of coun- ty sheriff offices now have access to the Center for reporting UFO sightings. These sources fill in hundreds of counties in the United States where MUFON does not presently have representa- tive This simply means that Dr. Hynek and the Center for UFO Studies have the means of decreas- ing the 90Z figure of sightings not presently be- ing reported. How does MUFON fit Into the \"big picture?\" Since we have established that the Center for UFO Studies\" is a research center, and MUFON is ba- sically an Investigative and research organiza- tion, MUFON can respond to UFO sighting reports referred to it by the Center from telephone calls made by police agencies. We thus have a fresh source of reports not previously available for study. Even though there will be a high degree of mutual cooperation and support between the Center for UFO Studies and the Mutual UFO Network, each will maintain its own distinct identify. By work- ing closely together, the tiro organizations are presenting a united front in the search for the answers to the UFO phenomena. Dr. Hynek is anx- ious to make one fact perfectly clear—the Center is not competing with existing UFO organizations, but endeavoring to supplement the work now being done in a more scientific and concise manner. In order to make the services of MUFON avail- able to the Center for referral of UFO sighting reports received via the toll-free number, the names, addresses, and home telephone numbers of all State Directors, State-Section Directors, Staff, and Consultants will be submitted by MUFON and placed in a confidential file accessible only to the Center. If, for any reason, one of the above designated Directors, Staff, or Consultants does not want to actively participate by receiving telephone calls from the Center, please advise Walt Andrus immed- iately. Any changes of address or telephone num- bers in the duplicated confidential file at the Center and MUFON must be immediately brought to the attention of Walt Andrus for revisions to maintain accuracy. The Director receiving the referral from the Center.will either investigate, the case person- ally or assign it to one of his or her qualified Field Investigators. Having been assigned the investigation, the Director is responsible for the continuity of the investigation and the writ- ten report regardless of whether he feels the re-j port Is significant or not. It is a \"UFO Sight-! ing Report\" as far as the, person reporting and the Center receiving It are concerned. My per- ; sonal experience on early Investigation into re* ports to the Center indicates that the citizens making the sighting are very appreciative of thei interview, because someone is seriously interest- ed. Following the interviews, a written invest!-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"gatlve report will be prepared in triplicate. One copy will be mailed to the Center for UFO Studies, P.O. Box 11, Northfield, Illinois 60093; the second to MUFON, 40 Christopher Court, Quincy Illinois 62301; and the third copy is retained by the investigator. In many cases, the State Di- rector also desires a copy of the UFO sighting report investigation, making a fourth. It has been wisely deemed that in order to maintain MUFON's distinct Identity, accuracy of current Directors' names, addresses, and tele- phone numbers, and follow-up on sighting reports that the Center will not contact individual Field Investigators, but will work through Directors. When a report is received by the Center, they will refer to a map and select the Director near- est the location to contact by telephone. It would not be feasible for the Center to call MUFON offices in Quincy with all reports, due to the long distance telephone call expense that would accrue to MUFON when these sightings were forwarded. As a tax-exempt institution, the Center will receive funds that will finance their telephone facilities. However, no provisions are available for long-distance charges by a MUFON Director to a Field Investigator or for telephone interviews, so each of us must use our own best ecomomic discretion in this matter, (this will continue to be an \"out-of'pocket expense\" attrib- utable to one's avocation.) At this point in time, MUFON is obligated to report only those sighting cases referred to MUFON by the Center. (All other reporting pro- cedures continue status quo.) Complaints have recently been received from MUFON Directors that the telephone operators at the \"800\" toll-free number refuse to accept re- ports from anyone except police agencies. . These are their current instructions from the Center. At present, MUFON members should have no occasion to telephone UFO sighting reports to the Center, since they should be investigated in the normal prescribed manner and the written report summit- ted to MUFON. Significant MUFON UFO sighting reports are for- warded by mail to David R. Saunders, Ph. D., MUFON consultant in Statistics at the University of Colorado to be added to his computer file, known as UFOCAT. It is expected that reports from the Center for UFO Studies will be delivered to the same point or a similar computer in the future. Thus all reports will be tabulated and recorded for computerized studies. It is thus apparent that at this stage of de- velopment of the Center the toll-free number be- ing utilized by police departments and sheriff offices in localities where competent Field In- vestigators are not known to police personnel or where qualified people do not exist is an asset and a source of reports not previously available. This featured article in SKTLOOK is being used to convey and communicate the responsibilities, obligations, and procedures by which MOFON will enthusiastically support the Center. New Zealand AUKLAND, NEW ZEALAND, SUNDAY NEWS, Jan. 6, 1974—A series of mysterious UFO sightings have shaken residents of the remote Hunua Ranges, 35 miles south of Aukland. Several have described sightings, but none would allow their names to be used. One witness reports that \"the first sighting was about 10:30 oh the night of Nov. 10. \"I just couldn't believe it. This terrifically\" bright light was all you could see at first. It came down over the hills and hovered over the lake (Aukland Regional Authority's Cossey Dam) for about seven minutes. Then it shot straight up in the air and took off to the west at a very fast rate.\" This witness made two more sightings, on Dec. 6 and Dec. 27. On Dec. 6 the object disappeared before he could call a friend as a second wit- ness. On Dec. 27 the witness turned on a light to search for his camera, but the object \"swit- ched its main light off, turned to the northeast, completed a full circle, and with one flashing red light and one still red light showing, took off to the west. He contacted Air Force and Civil Aviation au- thorities, which confirmed that there were BO helicopters in the area, but they said it was' probably lights from a jet airliner landing at Aukland International Airport. The witness re- jected this explanation, pointing out that there was no sound from the object, and that \"any noise in this area echoes throughout the hills. And there's no possibility of a big jet coming down behind the ranges and hovering over the dam. I don't know what the lights are, but if they're UFO'a, they're not hostile because they've been seen so often.\" Several witnesses have looked at the lights through binoculars, but have not been able to distinguish a shape. One man said the position- ing of the lights gave the object the appearance of being shaped like \"an old-fashioned lamp shade.\" He thought it was about 30 feet long. Observing it through binoculars about one mile away, the man said it seemed to be hovering about 100 feet above the water. The objects seem to appear around 10:30 p. ra., and thus far at three-week intervals. Capt. Bruce Cathie, a well-known UFO researcher, says the Hunua sightings are \"some of the better ones I've heard about.\" He added that there has been con- siderable UFO activity around Aukland recently, and said six people had sighted a number of high- flying discs over Piha about a week ago.

The sighting was first reported by Skylook in the December issue. The following information has been translated by Mrs. Mary Moeller for MUFON from the Oct. 23 1973, issue of El Comerrio of Lima, Peru, and the Oct. 23 issue of La Prensa of Lima: On Oct. 19 at about 3 p.m., Hugo Luyo Vega, 54, and a client stopped along the road between Lima and Matucana at a point which runs parallel to a railroad and the river Ritnac, about 31 miles from Lima. The client does not want his name used, ac- cording to Vega, who describes him as \"a wealthy person who wishes to remain anonymous.\" Skylook does not know the client's identity. The client reportedly first saw \"the luminous object\" near the bottom of a valley. The object was slowly moving in the direction of the two men, and Vega ran to his car to get his Polaroid camera. \"When I aimed my camera, and took the picture,\" he explained, \"the object was not over 50 meters (150 feet) from us and 20 meters (60 feet) from the ground. At the beginning the saucer moved . very slowly, but later the saucer rose out of sight, and this is precisely why I was able to take only the one picture.\" Vega said the object had unexpectedly changed direc- tion and turned towards the east, and at that time had increased its velocity and rose to avoid some high voltage lines that crossed the valley. The object was described as looking like an inverted soup bowl with a dome on its upper part. The color of the object was a shiny or polished silver. \"On the point of which 1 considered the dome, there was a kind of ball that emitted a fixed soft blue light,\" said Vega. \"Much lower we were able to distinguish a row of small win- dows resembling portholes.

Some detail has been lost in copying the original, enlarging the copy, and printing.

Mrs. J.P. (full name not given by Hoville) had gone into her kitchen to light a cigarette, and did not turn on the lights because of light from a nearby streetlight. At approximately 2 a.m. she was attracted by a white object which seemed to stand'just outside her kitchen window. She went to the window, which is very low, and discovered a \"four-foot-tall thing\" with a round head and two very bright eyes which had a phos- phorenscent glow. She said the eyes were three times as large as normal eyes. She did not see any mouth or nose. Around the head or helmet was some sort of halo or flames, and there seemed to be \"lacets\" around the neck. .The shoulders were not square like on human beings, but dropped from the head (or helmet) in a 45 degree angle. Mrs. J. P. said she was not afraid of \"the thing,\" and said it looked beautiful to her. She said sha was actually attracted by it, and could not move away. The \"thing\" departed after about 15 seconds, and Mrs. J.P. rushed into the bedroom to awaken her husband, who dressed, went to the door, switched on the.light, and saw nothing. He checked all around the house, except for the gar-- den, behind the garages, and found nothing but a \"scared to death\" dog lying on the ground. The following night the family's cat acted very strangely, running up and down; in the house and going to the window where \"the Thing\" had been seen the night before. The same night Provincial Police and a Catholic priest, Mr. Goulet, report- edly saw UFO's near Joliette in the vicinity of the Domtar Quarry, which, is about three-fourths of a mile from Mr. and Mrs. J. P.'s house.

The following is therefore a summary of the submitted data as it was presented in the Hungarian magazine Life & Science, January 12, 1955. Published in Budapest. On Oct. 25, 1954, literally thousands of Hun- garian citizens observed the appearance of a strange object which dashed through the morning sky. The time was 6:20 a.m., and it was seen by people from all sections of the country. It flew in a Northwest to Southeast direction. Most of the observers reported that it was extremely brilliant and appeared to be at a low altitude. The speed of this mysterious object was in ex- cess by several hundred times that of the fastest known airplane. Hundreds of eye-witness reports were submitted to the astronomical observatories in Hungary, and from these reports some possible calculations were made regarding this object. The Urania Observatory of Budapest sent out special questionaires (1500) to the best (in their opinion) qualified observers and from the answers of these witnesses constructed some very interesting conclusions. In a few cases, especi- ally in Budapest, the data on the altitude and the direction of flight were measured out on the exact location of the observer. The best obser- vations were those which fixed the movement of the object in the sky in relation to buildings and the direction of the rising sun. By this method, using data from 20 to 30 observations, it became possible to approximate the altitude and the trajectory of flight with relatively accurate precision. Of special interest here is the photograph of the object taken by Janos Biro, a teacher in Sopron County. This picture is a great rarity because as far as we know, only a very few such photographs of this nature have ever been taken with any success. At any rate, besides a great deal of luck one also needs a full measure of mental presence to be able to react in time to take such a picture. Biro did take a photograph of it and it is presented here for our readers to examine for themselves. By using the focal length of the . camera used by Biro and the dimensions of the resulting pic- ture, it is possible to ascertain with some de- gree of accuracy how large the phenomenon actual- ly appeared in the sky. According to the meas- urements carried out at the Drania Observatory, Photo taken by Janos Biro over Hungary on Oct. 25, 1954. the width of the object was somewhat smaller than twice the diameter of the sphere of the full moon. This was the size of the object as seen by the observer oh the ground with the naked eye. Assuming that the object's initial and final altitude was approximately 250 kilometers (155 mi..); and that its mid-trajectory was at 'about 190 kilometers (118 mi.) above the earth's sur- face; the distance travelled was roughly 2,200 kilometers (1,366 mi.), rather considerable. And if we then posit a flying time of 35 seconds, which corresponds to the median of the most plau- sible observations, we yield a relative speed of 63 kilometers per second or 39 miles a second. Although most of the observers thought this object was of a low altitude, the scientific com- munity felt from their analysis of the submitted reports and examination of the original photo- graph taken that the object was at an altitude of at least 250 kilometers. The witnesses had only reported what they had seen, and the astronomers stated their beliefs on what data they had to ex- amine. Was it a Flying Saucer, meteorite, or a fire- ball? No member of the scientific community would state an opinion positively, as no one was sure, and as of this date almost twenty years later it remains on file, classified as an Uni- dentified Flying Object. f 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Mini-flap in California noted SANTA ANA, CALIF. — Coming shortly, on the heels of the national UFO \"flap\" late in 1973, an unusually high number of UFO sightings have been noted in the Los Angeles-Orange Counties area within a two-week period. . Mrs. Idabel Epperson, Southern California's director for MUFON, recently commented on this flurry of activity, and her observations prompted authors David Branch -and Robert B. Klinn to re- port it in their weekly column, • \"The Continuing UFO,\" appearing in the Santa Ana Register. While details are somewhat sketchy, since in- vestigation is continuing, the following descrip- tions, excerpted from the column, are deserving of study:  . , . \"—Jan: 24, Santa Aha. Six witnesses viewed a circular red, blue, and white light as it hovered at an estimated altitude of 1,000 feet. \"--Jan. 27 and 28, Garden Grove. An unidenti- fied glowing object was observed by several people for as long as three hours. The fact that the object stayed in one spot, along with its sudden appearances and disappearances, seems to rule out a star or planet as a possible explan- ation. • , . • . . .\"—On Feb. 2 several witnesses, including two police officers, saw a huge, glowing white object over South Laguna. The chief witness, Patrick T. Archer, • first/sighted the UFO from the seventh floor of a hotel where he works at 5:15 a.m. (Mr. Archer is, -coincidentaly, the same man who re- ported being chased by a UFO on Nov. 8, 1973. Driving west from Elythe, Calif.,, he said he was pursued at 115 miles per hour.by an oval UFO with white lights.) \"Archer first sighted the object hovering over the water off the Laguna Beach Coast. After he blinked his flashlight at it, the strange light started moving toward North Laguna. It then stopped and hovered over the town for an esti- mated 30 minutes. During this time several other people, -including two police officers, became aware of the UFO and studied it intently. Sud- denly the object began moving toward South La- guna. It passed over Archer, and several other witnesses at an amazingly low altitude of about 300 feet. \"This case 'is reportedly under intensive.in- vestigation both by Archer and a Ph.D. geochemist representing MUFON. (Additional details of the sighting will be revealed when available.) 11 —At 5:30 a.m., Feb. 6, Mrs. Helen Mahan in Northridge saw a brilliant white light moving from the southwest to the northwest. It was a- bout a quarter of the apparent size of the full moon. The UFO had a smaller light which \"spurted\" as the main object flew. The light was also seen from Sherman Oaks by a young man unrelated to the witness. The witnesses do not believe the object was any type of conventional aircraft or celest- rial body. \"—The mother'.of the male witness, in Sherman Oaks, mentioned above, reports sighting an un- conventional aerial object on the following even- ing, Feb. 7, at 11:30 p.m. Mrs. Ethel Barnes is a pilot, familiar with the night sky. She and her family reportedly observed a brilliant star-like UFO, three times the size, of Venus (the most brilliant object in the night sky except the moon). The UFO had a definite trail of light, moved, from southeast to northwest, through 160 degrees in approximately 60 seconds. Because of the object's speed and appearance, . Mrs. Barnes rules out any conventional solution to her sight- ing. . , \"But the most recent dramatic case to come,.to our attention occurred Jan. 29. A flying in- structor along with.his student pilot .were cir- cled and buzzed repeatedly for one hour by at least five glowing red objects. The airplane was over the Pacific Ocean off the Southern Californ- ia coast. \"Last Friday night we met with the instructor- witness to gain preliminary information on the case. At .the request of the witness, we asked for and received specific authorization from Dr. J. Allen Hynek (head of the newly formed Center for UFO Studies and chairman of the Department of As- stronomy at Northwestern University) to.act as his agent in this investigation...\" In discussing this flurry of UFO activity in Southern California, Mrs. Epperson suggested to The Register the possibility that people in the paper's readership area are now more \"aware\" of the UFO phenomenon, thus more inclined to report sightings. (The Register has carried its weekly column, \"The Continuing UFO,\" since August, 1972) While almost impossible to prove, this factor undoubtedly has had some effect. This much is certain: since the column began, a significant number of calls have been received from several serious individuals reporting what they believed were genuine UFO sightings. In every case they were referred to Mrs. Epperson for appropriate action. In addition, a few \"hidden reports\" — dealing with incidents previously unreported — were volunteered to The Register.

Jacques Bergier's name will be familiar to those who have read the books he has co-authored with Louis Pauwels—THE MORNING OF THE MAGICIANS, IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBILITIES and THE ETERNAL MAN. Now, Bergier has come out with a new title in the continually-expanding line of books on space vis- itors of the past. This one is called—are you ready?~EXTRATERRESTRIAL VISITATIONS FROM PRE- HISTORIC TIMES TO THE PRESENT. Unfortunately, the book doesn't quite live up to its imposing title at times. Bergier covers much familiar ground and has also chosen to quote from unreliable sources for some of his material. There are some \"nuggets\" in this book, but one sometimes wonders if it is worth the trouble to dig them.out. The author is another of those who choose to con- struct hypotheses about ET visitors while ignor- ing the UFO evidence. Any such venture must, of necessity, be incomplete.

In CAN YOU SPEAK VENUSIAN?, he covers the viewpoints expressed by a variety of people whom he designates as \"Independent Thinkers.\" These are not to be confused with \"crackpots,\" Moore says. The basic difference between the two types being that \"independent Thinkers\" are quite sin- cere and well-meaning, while the cranks are more or less synonymous with crooks. Ne'edless to say, Moore lumps UFO believers into the same general category as believers in a flat Earth. One chap- ter of the book is devoted to the claims of \"Dr.\" George King; another chapter summarizes Moore's own \"research\" into the UFO phenomena. Some of the other subjects covered include the \"Hollow Earth\" theory, Atlantis, Velikovsky, astrology and the von Daniken theories. Though Moore claims the utmost respect for those with unconventional ideas, one cannot escape the feel- ing that his is merely a slightly more \"sophisti- cated\" way of poking fun. The book is available for $6.95 from W.W. Norton & Co., Inc. - 55 Fifth Avenue - N.Y., N.Y. 10003. A mixture of important historical data and questionable speculations may be found in F. W. Holiday's book, THE DRAGON AND THE DISC. Briefly, the author concludes that dragons and discs have been the basis for many religions. The disc is a symbol of good, while the dragon represents evil. It is true that such symbols may be found in the artwork of ancient nations, but interpretations are a different matter. Holiday equates dragons with the Loch Ness Monster and other such crea- tures; the discs, of course, are our modern UFOs. It makes for intriguing reading, but some of the author's theories must be seriously questioned. Holiday seems to be of the \"paraphysical con- struct\" school of thought with respect to aerial and aquatic phenomena. While the concept deserves consideration, it also has its drawbacks. Still, considering the research involved in this book, I would recommend it to all who may be interested. Well-illustrated, THE DRAGON AND THE DISC may be ordered from W. W.

The object was witnessed by Mrs. Fay Seeley, Mrs. Seeley's sons Richard and Russell, Mrs. Fay Hile- man, -and Mrs. Hileman's son Richard. They first saw the ob- ject as a bright, then dimming light low in the sky as they were driving on highway 14 near Bremond. Later, the ob- ject appeared first on one side of their auto, then on the other, \"quicker than the eye could see,\" according to Mrs. Hileman. Richard Seeley said, \"It was following us, but I did not say much about it. I knew that my mama was worried, and I was scared myself.\" As they kept driving, the object dimmed, then got brighter, and seemed to disappear. Later it appeared again as they neared the Brazos River bridge, and they slowed down. Mrs.' Seeley ex- plained that \"I. saw that the thing was going to land in front of us on the highway. It never did land, but was about treetop high and was blocking my way, so I stopped. No I did not stop, I don't think. I whirled that car around .and got out of there as fast as I could, but it was still right there all the time. But when we got to Reagan and got back on State 6 we were behind another car and the thing just seemed to.lift up and disap- pear.\" Richard Seeley described the object as \"point- ed on top.\" Mrs. Hileman said, \"It was sort of round and had a point on top and two on the bot- tom. When it would be bright, I could not see the points too well, and there were the shadows it cast when it was just over the highway.\" Mrs. Seeley said later that \"I just do not believe that thing would have let me drive on any farther ....I just know that the thing would not have let me go by.\" Another unidentified motorist reportedly told police about such an object following his car a- long State 6 from Reagan to Marlin Route, but this has not been verified. Other sightings of lights in the sky were also reported during the same general time period. (As reported in the Rosebud; Texas, News, Nov. 22, 1973.) Mr. J.P.

She asked her husband what it was, and he de- nied any knowledge of it. A neighbor (unnamed) suggested that possibly a flying saucer had land- ed, since the neighbor had reportedly once .seen an object land on the road going to Potchesfs- troom; the object disappeared before he reached it, but left a. dark spot similar to that on the lawn.  .   •'•'• The circle is about 9 feet in diameter, and there are cross-like grooves which look like \"paw marks\" at three points outside the circle.

Both Gordon and Skylook have the nanes of the witnesses, however. By Stan Gordon MUFON State Director, Pennsylvania At 10:55 p.m. Feb. 6, 1974, Uniontown State Police Barracks received a phone call from the daughter of the main witness, who informed the officer of the happenings taking place at their residence. The Westmoreland County UFO Study Group communications center monitored the bar- racks dispatching a car to check a report \"of some people shooting at two creatures from a spaceship.\" In a minute the car was advised \"that the spaceship is allegedly still at the location.\" The police call us when they have UFO's reported to them; however, since it was a possible landing, our operator immediately called the barracks to obtain all data. The names of the witnesses were obtained from the civilian radio dispatcher for Uniontown State Police. Trooper X was dispatched to the scene along with one national guardsman. The national guard has been riding as backups with state troopers during the truckers strike. As the report was relayed to Trooper X, Sgt. Y, the officer in charge that night, was notified of the incident. Any report of any unusual nature which might develop into something is always made known to the OIC. We made a tele- phone call to the residence of the daughter of the main witness to determine whether the case warranted having a field team dispatched to the area immediately. After obtaining the story, ana since no physical evidence was located., ,we made plans to see some of the witnesses early' £he next morning. This worked out better since it was about an hour ride to the area, and since there was a strike on, no gas was available till the next day. Early the next morning George Lutz and I ar- ; rived at the scene. The area of• the sighting was almost isolated with a few homes down the road. The area is surrounded by thick woods, and the Youghiogheny River flows about a mile away. The witnesses live off of a private drive. Mrs. Doe, the main witness, lives in an old house, and her daughter and son-in-law live in a modern trailer Just next door. Mrs. Doe showed us her animal pens, then we vent into her home and set up our tape recorders. Mrs. Doe, a 59-year-old woman who has lived in the country all her life, and has very little fear of anything living, sat down at the table and related the events that had taken place the night before. Sometime between. 10 and 10:30 p.m. she was sit- ting in her home watching television when she heard the rattling of tin cans on her front porch. There had been several wild dogs seen in the area, and thinking that this is what it was, she loaded her 16 gauge shotgun with one shell of 8 shot ammunition. The gun was double barrel; however she was going to use only one chamber to scare the intruder away. After loading the gun, she switched on the porch light and stepped into the doorway. In front of her porch at a distance of 6 feet was a huge hair-covered apelike crea- ture that raised its arms over its head as the light was switched on. The woman thought the creature was going to lunge at her so she fired the gun at the creature's midsection. Upon impact the creature just \"disappeared\" in a flash of light. The flash was discribed as bright, and as though someone was taking a picture. There was no sound or smell at this time. The creature was described as being over 7 feet tall. It was apelike, but stood erect on two legs and was covered from head to toe with dark gray hair. The incident happened in a matter of seconds and she didn't take a good look at other physical de- tails. Following the incident, she went back in- to the house and shut the door, quite shaken over the experience. Her son-in-law just then called on the phone and wanted to know what she had shot at. She related the details and he loaded his 22 revolver and proceeded on foot toward his mother- in-law's residence. On the way up he saw a figure running down the road, but was unable to make it out. Several feet ahead of him near the woods he saw \"4 or 5 shadows of hairy people.\" As he approached clos- er, the creatures also began to approach him at a< fast pace. He shined his flashlight on them and then became scared at the sight, and dropped his flashlight, but drawed his revolver. He fired two' shots at the intruders, then he ran, not looking back to see what they were doing. He described them as being over 7 feet tall, completely hair-covered, with fire-red eyes that were luminescent even in total darkness. The arms seemed to be long, and the creatures walked on two legs, moved upright but with an awkward movement somewhat like an orangutan. He didn't notice any sound or smell. After he fired at them, he ran into his nother- in-law's home and reloaded his revolver. He was persistent to \"get one of the things\" even though he just couldn't believe it. He went back out- side and couldn't see any creatures, but he did observe a bright blinking red light about 500 yards away in the woods. There are no radio, towers or signs to confuse the light with. The light was very bright and was said to be similar in size and shape to a Christmas ornament, or to 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"This sketch has been copied from one made by Bob McCurry for the Westmoreland County UFO Study Group. It shows a creature sighted about,5 p. m. Aug. 23, 1973, at Luxor, Pa. While many of the creatures sighted in Pennsylvania have some char- acteristics which are similar, the above drawing does not necessarily represent what Mrs. Doe or her son-in-law saw on Feb. 6. a beacon light on a police car. After seing this, he ran to his trailer to get his deer rifle, and to tell his wife to call someone for help. The family knew the county humane officer, so they phoned him. He was busy at the time and his wife,suggested that they call the State Police. The state trooper arrived a short time later, along with a guardsman. They interviewed the witnesses and looked • over the area for evidence. No footprints could be found, which could be due to the ground being frozen from the night before. The weather that day was: temperatures in the high 30's, humidity B2%, wind out of the SE at 5 mph, and barometer reading at 29:15 and falling. The two investigating officers just before they completed their search were joined by Troop- er Z and two other guardsman.' Trooper X stated \"that they didn't go out to where the light was seen, since it was a heavily wooded area.\" The light had disappeared prior to his arrival. The trooper -said that the son-in-law was visibly shaken, and that both witnesses seemed to be re- liable people. When the trooper was asked his opinion of the incident he said, \"I don't dis- believe it; there have been too many sightings to laugh at it.\" A short time before Mrs. Doe shot at the crea- ture, she heard a strange humming sound, some- thing like a propeller aircraft as heard in the distance, but louder. About one-half hour after the police left, she heard the sound again. One of the most bizarre effects that occurred during the incident was the animal behavior. The two families have a total of 4- dogs, including beagles, a bird dog, and an Eskimo spitz. The trooper and the witnesses all stated that all 4 dogs were shaking, and hiding in their housings, and that they wouldn't make a sound. The dogs normally would^bark. ferociously at'any strangers.; When we were there the next day they seemed to be normal. . . . . , Besides the dogs, the family's horse was act- ing very . nervous at the time. The horse, which normally runs to' its oats when they are put out, had to be forcefully moved to the barn to eat. The horse would only take a bite of oats arid run.' The horse also would stay in a part of the barn- yard that it never is in on a normal basis. The cats in the son-in-law's trailer also seemed very disturbed. The cats would not leave the daughter alone. Everywhere she went they would cuddle close to her. Another interesting point was that the daughter mentioned that she had been up all night with her 6-morith-old son. She said that the baby was crying all night, which is the first time that the baby was so dis- turbed since it was born. Not the first UFO-Creature encounter The son-in-law had told the state police dis- patcher as well as. us that this was not the-first encounter he had had with one of the creatures. He had read in the paper of creatures being seen, in October near Uniontown, but at that tine..he told his wife \"that someone had a little too much to drink.\" That was until his first encounter in November of 1973. He normally runs his dogs at night before going to sleep, and one evening a- bout 10 or 10:30 p. m. he had one of his dogs up near the corner of the woods. He always carries a 22 revolver with him because of wild. dogs. As he approached the area he saw a 'dark figure ahead of him. He thought that it was a man prowling around, so he told him to halt, and asked him what he wanted. He received -no reply. Then the. figure turned around and the son-in-law was con- fronted by a large hairy apelike creature. He fired six shots.from his revolver at the crea- ture. He said that the creature just vanished in front of his eyes, but that he could hear^it run- ning away and could see nothing. At times the steps seemed to stop, then continue on. The s.on- in-law couldn't believe his eyes, and returned to his trailer to obtain his 30.40 Craig rifle,.mak- ing up his mind to \"get one of those things. 1 ' He said that \"it was something that isn't supposed to be,\" and returned to the woods.to get his prey. When he was back near the woods, he again (continued on page 16) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(continued from page 15) saw the creature and fired at it. When it was hit it let out a very loud scream like the cry of a baby. His wife heard it from inside the trailer and said that she could hardly describe it except that it might sound like a person in very deep pain. After the incident they didn't know who to call, so they called the humane officer. During the summer of 1973 and continuing up until this time, a number of strange incidents have occurred at this location. Mrs. Doe late one night, either in September or October, was awakened by a bright light that was shining in her window. She got up to look, and observed a bright white sphere about 25 feet off the ground that was illuminating the trailer near the front section. Other strange lights have been seen by both families during this period. The strange humming sound that Mrs. Doe had heard before and after she shot at the creature, had been heard by her daughter and son-in-law and Mrs. Doe before. They believe they heard it a short time before the son-in-law had his first encounter in Novem- ber. The dogs always carry on very strangely when this humming.starts. Strange. Aspects Uncovered Sometime after 12 midnight after the police left the scene of the shooting on Feb. 6., the daughter called her mother on the phone to see if she was calmed down. She rang the line for a long period, but there was no answer. The daugh- ter thought she might have dialed wrong, so she re-dialed and let it ring over 20 times. She be- came worried, so she told her husband to go up to her mother's and see if she was okay. The son- in-law, still shaky,'drove (100 feet) by car to his mother-in-law's home. When he arrived\" his mother-in-law was awake and wanted to know why he came up. She said that she was lying awake and said she heard him get into the car and slam the door, • and just as his car passed by her window the phone rang.' The daughter had been ringing the line constantly until her husband ' got into the house. The mother-in-law says that \"the phone just wasn't ringing\" or'she would have heard it. The possibility exists that there might be a per- .iod of time missing from Mrs.. Doe's memory. This aspect will be looked into further. About a week before the incident of Feb. 6, 'Mrs. Doe heard a noise outside her home late at night and when she opened up her door and turned on her porch light she saw a bright flash in her yard (just like the flash that occurred when she shot the creature and it disappeared). Several times since the summer, Mrs. Doe stated that late at night when she was sleeping, she felt someone touch her and she would wake up startled since no one was around. She has several times felt as though someone was in the house with her. Two weeks before the shooting of Feb. 6, Mrs. Doe was awakened one night by a loud thump, as though something heavy was thrown against her house, but nothing was found. A couple of days after the son-in-law saw the creature in November a large black female cat mysteriously disappeared from its locked cage. The cage has two compart- ments side by side. The female cat was in the left side and two of its kittens were in the right side. The cat had been locked in the night before, and in the morning the enclosure where the female cat had been was locked but empty. There is an outside manual lock which has to be turned to open. What was so strange was that there was fresh snow on the ground, but no foot- prints whatsoever, not even that of a cat. Mrs. Doe believes that either the night before the large cat disappeared or within a few 'days of that incident she was out on the front porch when that loud humming noise started, but nothing was seen. At that tine the dogs began to bark and the cats huddled very close to her. When she went inside later her cats refused to go outside. While we were interviewing the witnesses, the Fayette County humane officer stopped in. He is not just a typical dog catcher, but investigates cruelty to any type of animal. He handles cases of mutilations of farm animals as well. First of all he vouched for the character of the witnesses and said that they were good honest people and .very reliable. After discussing with him the facts of the case as well as a general rundown of the other Pennsylvania cases, he brought to .Tight the fact that there had been numerous mysterious animal mutilations in the county arid that there x?ere four cases presently that they can't explain un- der natural circumstances. The cases had occurred in the same areas where investigating UFO and creature sightings. He is taking the possibility seriously that the mutilations might somehow be connected to the sightings. He searched the wooded area with us where the light had been seen but nothing unusual was found. We did find, how- ever, two bee-bee type holes in a tree, which would be\" directly in line with the point where Mrs. Doe said she fired at the creature. From all indications the witnesses appear to be reliable and down to earth in 'their, ideas. Mrs. Doe said that she was reluctant to tell any- one about her experiences because everyone would think she was crazy. The daughter stated when we first began to interview her that she didn't want anything in the newspaper about the incident. She was told as everyone else we interview that we never release names unless we are authorized by the individuals involved. Many of the -aspects of the case are identical to numerous other unpublicised UFO-Creature cases that we have investigated in seven counties in Western Pennsylvania. The animal disturbances was the most common effect of the cases that were reported. A number of individuals involved in these incidents also reported hearing loud thumps as though something was thrown against their homes. Others reported psychic phenomena such as : strange sound and invisible entities that touched them while they slept. Several other cases have brought forth possibilities that some of the UFO- (contlnued on next page) 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Around the Network MUFON will present a special public awareness program on UFO's at the three-day program of \"The Electronic World,\" a showing of home electronic devices at the Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City April 26, 27, and 28.

The continuing cases of this type indicate that we are dealing with an intel- ligence that is far more advanced technically and mentally than the human race. From the data that we have gathered I believe that it is of the utmost importance that detailed scientific study be made into this particular aspect of the UFO Phenomena. The implications that have been uncovered must be seriously looked into to find out the purpose behind these visita- tions. TRAVEL WECOMING COMMITTEE MEMBER c/fietnta- Paul W. Kelley, Sacramento, Calif., notes that the Lions Club's Interplanetary Space Travelers Welcome Committee now has thousands of members world wide: \"We received a letter from Eric von Daniken, and he believes we will have actual con- tacts with Visitors 'from outer space in our own lifetime. Also a very fine letter from Sen. Uarry Goldwater.\" The purpose of the Welcome Committee is to encourage humane treatment and possible, af- firmative understanding of space visitors. Mem- . bership in the committee is available from Kelley at 1200 Teneighth Way, Sacramento, for a donation of $1.00 or more. Donations go to activities of the South Sacramento Lions youth programs and for honorary Welcome Committee memberships for law enforcement agencies and others.

The UFO RESEARCH COMMITTEE (UFORC), formed in June 1965, is a fact-finding organ- ization serving the UFO community through dissemination of pertinent UFO informa- tion to interested and serious UFO investigators and researchers, scientists and computer-programmers, UFO groups, libraries (public and institutional), etc,, here and abroad. In May 1969, UFORC contracted for a UFO newspaper-clipping service through a re- putable, international clipping bureau, since we found it impossible to obtain needed news items oh UFOs without such a service (i.e., little-known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases, and other reports of these types, many of which are carried only in small-town papers.) In 1970, we added INTERNATIONAL COVERAGE, with clippings of UFO reports coming in from coun- tries such as: England, Australia, Canada, New Zealand & South Africa.All foreign language clippings used are translated into english. This complete United States and WORLD-WIDE newsclipping coverage costs UFORC any- where from $6^.00 per month to as.high as $2^0.00 per month in times of high UFO activity.

For this reason, WE ARE WILLING TO SHARE OUR CLIP- PING SERVICE WITH YOU, for our mutual benefit.

Mars—is past the meridian at sunset and sets about 4 hours later. Jupiter—rises in the east about 1*4 hours be- fore the sun. Saturn—is past the meridian at sunset and sets before midnight. Did black hole hit Tunguska? The December, 1973, Science Digest reports a new theory related to the spectacular damage to an area of Siberia which occurred in 1908. Residents of the sparsely populated Tunguska region had reported ' seeing a large pillar of fire, and hearing what sounded like several ex- plosions. Trees were leveled within 20 miles of the point of impact, horses were knocked down 400 miles away, and shock waves were recorded as far away as Washington, D.C. Though the damage was usually listed as the product of the Tunguska Comet, not all scien- tists agreed. Some said it was a meteorite of antimatter that exploded on contact with atoms of matter in our atmosphere. Others said that it might even have been a nuclear device aimed at our earth by an advanced civilization. Two American scientists, A. A. Jackson IV and Michael P. Ryan Jr., working at the University of Texas, now postulate that the cause of all the damage recorded was actually a black hole about the size of a fleck of dust. A black hole is an object which has collapsed to an extremely small size. Black holes have tremendous densities, and correspondingly heavy weights. Jackson and Ryan estimate that the black hole which may have caused the damage in Siberia weighed about a million billion tons, and trav- eled about 25,000 miles an hour. The physicists say that such a black hole would have caused shock waves and a fiery blue column. They estimate that it would have had enough force to pass through the Earth and out the other side, which would have been the North Atlantic side. The scientists plan to check their theory by consulting meteorological rec- ords of the North Atlantic area. UFO SIGHTING REPORT Date: February 18, 1974 Time: 5:15 a.m., C.D.S.T. Location: Farm Home Route 2, near Chelsea, OR. Witness: Clay Knight, Age 42 (Dairyman and grad- uate of Oklahoma State University) Telephone interview on 2/25/74 by: Walter H. Andrus, Jr. Clay Knight's Statement; Clay was about 300 yards from his barn when he saw the object. His dog heard the object and ran frightened back to their farm home. He saw the object at this time about 50 to 75 yards above his head. It had an orange-red blinking light on the bottom. This also frightened Mr. Knight, and he started running toward his house. It seemed to follow him and the light remained directly over head. He ran back to the house to get his wife. The light was now north of his house. His wife never did see the light. He later walked out to his pond and observed the light out in the pasture. He said it dropped down below a small hill. One and one-half hours later it moved straight up when it was north of him. He had heard an eerie sound when it was di- rectly over his head. He has never heard such a high-pitched sound before. His dog ran from it, probably due to hurting, its ears. The dog ran yelping to the house. Some of his cattle got ex- cited and ran through a barbed-wire fence when the light was nearby. In describing the object, he compared its size to that of a small bedroom. It was flat on the bottom and rounded off on the top. It was twice as wide as it was high. The shape could be best described as oval-shape with a flat bottom. The stars were not visible in the sky, since it was \"getting ready to storm.\" Appeared like a shiny tin color as it was departing. There was no indi- cation that it had landed or touched the ground. He was told that a neighbor saw it from a dis- tance, but he has not talked to the neighbor per- sonally. CONCLUSION; Probable UFO based upon the lights, sound and maneuvering. Check your ADDRESS Beginning with the March Issue, Skylook is using a stencil system of addressing the magazine each month.
