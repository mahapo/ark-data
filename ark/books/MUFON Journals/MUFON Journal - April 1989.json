The additional weight, for the-most part, comes from Dr. Bruce Mac- cabee's thorough, thoughtful analysis of the controversy sur- rounding the Gulf Breeze case, particularly the charge that the primary witness, \"Mr. Ed,\" may have hoaxed the resulting Pola- roid, 35mm and video pictures that support his remarkable ser- ies of repeat sightings, including alleged abduction(s). While we doubt Dr. Maccabee's article will dispel every lin- gering doubt in the minds of many, or heal all the rifts between individual researchers (tempers, apparently, have flared too much for that), we do hope it will aid and allow our other members and subscribers to reach their own unbiased conclu- sions about this extremely intriguing episode in contemporary ufology. In addition, we've managed to cram in our other regular departments, plus a few extras, like Dr. Richard Haines's sug- gested technique for the analysis of UFO-associated sounds. We hope it doesn't get overlooked in the Gulf Breeze crunch. In this issue THE SCALE REMAINS UNBALANCED .... Bruce Maccabec, Ph.D. 3 UFO SOUND RECOGNITION TECHNIQUE  Richard F.

The general points are (1) both favorable and unfavorable conclusions about the sightings report- ed by Mr. Ed were publicized prema- turely, i.e., before the analysis of the sightings was completed, (2) there has been insufficient publication of the results of the various investiga- tions carried out, not only of Ed's sightings and photographs, but also of the sightings of the other Gulf Breeze\" witnesses, (3) there is \"nega- tive evidence\" which reduces the credibility of Ed's reports and sug- gests that Ed and his wife (and also children and a friend and perhaps others in Gulf Breeze) have contrived a UFO hoax and (4) \"the 'positive' evidence has been reported in great detail,\" but legitimate skeptical ques- tions and issues have received far less attention. It is my considered attempt to demonstrate. The numerous incidents and pho- tos referred to in this paper have been described in considerable detail in reference 2, A History of the Gulf Breeze, Florida Sightings which was first published in the MUFON 1988 International UFO Symposium Pro- ceedings. A corrected and updated version is available from the Fund for UFO Research. The updated version includes an analysis of the stereo photos of February 26 and May 1, and also copies of the viewgraphs presented at the Symposium. Many of the incidents and photos referred to here nave been published in several issues of the MUFON UFO Journal, references 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 and 9 (March through September, 1988). Not Primarily A Photographic Case Before beginning my responses to specific questions I would like to make general comments regarding the numerous photographs which comprise a very important part of the Gulf Breeze sightings. My initial impres- sion (and that of other investigators) was that Ed's sightings constituted a primarily photographic case. In fact most investigators (myself included) initially felt that they could rely upon the photographic evidence alone to make or break the case. Therefore I, and others, diligently searched for irregularities and oddities which would clearly prove that hoax techniques were used in creating the pictures. I could find no convincing proof. As I searched, however, I recalled some- thing that I had learned years ago while studying previous photographic UFO sightings (e.g., Trent, 1950; Mariana film, 1950; Gemini 11, 1966; New Zealand, 1978), namely, that the validity or invalidity of photographic reports cannot be based solely upon a study of the photos because photo- graphic evidence is \"unfairly biased\" for the hoax hypothesis. This bias comes about because a single UFO photo could contain evidence that, by itself, proues the sighting is phony. (For example, there might be a verti- cal linear image above the image of a \"UFO\" indicating that it was sus- pended by a string or thread; there might be an image below the UFO image suggesting that the UFO was supported from below; there might be a discontinuous variation in bright- ness or color between the edge of the UFO image and the background indi- cating a photo montage; or there might be overlapping images indicating a double exposure.) However, it is my present opinion that no single photo could contain evidence which would, by itself, prove a sighting report to be valid (\"a photo does not a UFO make\") because the failure to find evidence of a hoax could mean that the hoaxing was done well enough to be undetectable. A corollary of this conclusion is that the truth or falsity of a photo which contains no clear evidence of a hoax must be proven using some other information. If by some other means the photo is proven to be a hoax then the fact that the hoax was not detected in the photo means that the hoaxer was either very lucky or had access to sophisticated photographic equipment and had developed an excellent photo hoaxing technique. It seems to me that, given enough equipment and capability any photo could be hoaxed. Therefore it appears a UFO photo which contains no clear evidence of hoaxing has no \"value\" other than to provide a reasonably accurate depiction of what the wit- ness(es) saw, assuming that the other information obtained from the sight- ing investigation is sufficient to prove that the witness(es) actually did see a UFO. There is another very important corollary to this argument: the \"bet- ter\" a photo is (the more convincing it is) the more difficult it is to fake. Therefore one can properly ask whether or not the level of technical ability and the quality of the equipment needed to produce the photo would be available to the witness. In order to answer this question the investiga- tor must (a) study methods by which photos can be hoaxed and determine whether or not the witness was famil- iar with any of these methods and (b) determine whether or not the witness would have access to the necessary equipment. It may be possible to show that the witness does, indeed, un- derstand the methods of hoax photo- graphy and has access to the equip- ment necessary. If this is true then 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the hoax hypothesis is supported. Alternatively it may be impossible to show that the witness has neither the knowledge of hoax photograph tech- niques nor the access to the required equipment. In this case the hoax hypothesis is not supported. In this case one could state that the photo was probably not hoaxed. (Of course, if it were possible to prove that the witness had neither knowledge nor the necessary equipment, and if it could be proven that no one hoaxed the witness, then the hoax hypothesis would be disproved.) Proper Perspective I have presented this general dis- cussion to set Ed's photos into the proper perspective. Ed has been accused of hoaxing the photos (or having an accomplice hoax them) and this raises the question could he (or an accomplice) have done it? A detailed study of his photos shows that they could only be hoaxed using rather complicated techniques, for example, by using models in combi- nation with matted double exposures, in combination with reflections in glass or in combination with photom- ontages and rephotography (paste a photo of a model on a much larger print of the background scenery and photograph the combination). I and other investigators have searched for any conclusive evidence that Ed has any more than a rudimentary know- ledge of photography. We have found no such conclusive evidence. Furth- ermore, there is no testimonial evi- dence or physical evidence that Ed has had a camera more complicated than his old Polaroid (until February, 1988, when the MUFON investigators gave him a camera to use). This lack of even slightly sophisticated camera equipment, such as a 35mm variable focus, variable f/stop, variable shutter time camera, \"bodes ill\" for the hoax hypothesis since it would be likely that he would have one or more sophisticated cameras if he were familiar with photographic techniques. One of Ed's acquaintances (\"Patrick Hanks,\" who is also a witness to one of Ed's sightings when a photo was not taken; Dec. 27, 1987) works in a video rental store which also accepts 4 film for developing. Some investiga- tors advanced the idea that perhaps Ed's photos were created by this per- son using equipment at the store. However, it was subsequently deter- mined that the store sends out the film for processing and has no equip- ment of its own. Thus it appears that Ed had neither the knowledge nor the access to the equipment necessary to make his supposed hoax photos. Of course, the failure to find evidence of photographic knowledge and capabil- ity is not sufficient evidence to prove that the photos weren't hoaxed. If they were, Ed would naturally attempt to conceal any information which Ocould suggest he was capable of hoaxing them. But, on the other hand, this line of investigation has provided no support for the hoax hypothesis even though one would expect it to provide some support for that hypothesis if the photos were, in fact, hoaxes by Ed or someone else. Besides Ed's photos there are two other sets of photos which show the same type of UFO: \"Believer Bill's\" photos that were delivered to the Gulf Breeze Sentinel office during the evening of Dec. 22, 1987 and \"Jane's\" photos that were delivered to the newspaper in late November, 1987. These photos were made with differ- ent types of cameras (110 format and 35mm format). The photographers have not revealed their complete identities, and therefore have not been interviewed. It should be possi- ble to establish that these photo- graphers were in collusion with Ed (or that Ed actually took these pho- tos) if all of the Gulf Breeze photos are hoaxes. I have studied Ed's photos and have found no clear evidence of hoaxing (no strings, no supports, etc.) Yet, there are odd features of the UFO images. The operative ques- tion is, do any of these odd features prove that the photos are hoaxes, or might any of these oddities be inher- ent properties of the UFOs them- selves? Many of these features cer- tainly bear discussion (and will be discussed), but none of these, in my opinion, proues that they are hoax photos. Thus I feel that this is not primarily a photographic case because the truth or falsity of Ed's reports must be based on non-photographic infor- mation. No Lack of Skepticism Hall and Smith have complained that there has not been enough skep- ticism about Ed's reports on the part of the \"pro\" investigators. However, to the contrary, the investigators were skeptical from the beginning (Walter Andrus' initial thought was \"shades of Billy Meier,\" reference 3, page 15). My initial response in hear- ing about the case, in early January (1988), was similar. A few weeks later I first saw (poor) copies of the first five photos and I wasn't impressed. I presumed that they were hoaxes and I wasn't interested in studying them. In late January I saw better copies (black and white, 8\" * 10\" prints made by Robert Nathan) and I was impressed by the lack of image over- lap in the first photo (more on this later). \"Tough double exposure,\" I thought. However, I still considered them to be hoaxes. It wasn't until I got a call from Budd Hopkins, near the middle of February, 1988, that I became more interested. Budd had visited Ed and had gained the impres- sion that neither Ed nor his wife were lying about their encounters (evi- dently the same impression that the local investigators had gained in Jan- uary) and he told me that Ed's sight- ings could be of considerable impor- tance and suggested that I study the photographic evidence to see if there was evidence of a hoax. I was still skeptical and thought that the local investigators were probably being a bit soft-headed in even thinking that these photos might be valid. Budd also told me that the Gulf Breeze sightings (not just Ed's sight- ings) had received a lot of press attention and that there was going to be a TV documentary on Ed's sight- ings. This worried me a lot. I felt that it was premature to be publicizing so \"shaky\" a case. I was afraid that after all the publicity was over the case would be proven to be a hoax and then, once again, UFO investigators would be the butt of jokes from the press and skeptics. Although I was reluctant to get involved because I MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"figured it would be a waste of time investigating a photographic hoax case, I decided to go to Florida before the major publicity got started. I hoped to be able to resolve the con- troversy (by demonstrating that the photos had been a hoax) before the TV documentary was completed so that the expose would not occur after the media blitz. My own investigation began on Feb. 19 when I flew to Florida and met the local investigators and Ed. As I carried out my investigation over the next few days I felt the \"weight\" of the impending press attention and I didn't like it. The press is always pushing for answers or at least for quotable statements and this pres- sure hinders the investigation. As I worked with the local investigators and with Ed I found more and more questions were being raised and few answers of the type I sought (proving a hoax) were forthcoming. I wasn't able to find immediate proof of a hoax, but neither could I prove that the sightings were real. My response to a press query about my opinion of the case was that it was \"impressive.\" I knew that this was certainly true: it was impressive whether real or a hoax. Because I could arrive at no conclusion I felt even more strongly that publicity was premature. (The documentary was shown on March 4.) Skeptical of the Skeptics I remained skeptical through the springtime as I worked on the MUFON symposium paper (ref. 2) and as I communicated with Ed and the local investigators. However, my skepti- cism was \"tempered by reality\" as Ed continually responded to my requests for technical information, some of which could have damaged his case by helping me prove a fraud. I care- fully listened to what Ed was saying and I checked and cross-checked. Of course, my investigation was not per- fect. \"Loose ends\" have cropped up since my report at the MUFON sym- posium. Nevertheless, I could find no \"smoking gun,\" although several skep- tics claimed that they had found sev- eral reasons, both photographic and non-photographic, to doubt the case. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 I felt that many of their arguments were weak or just plain wrong and so I became skeptical of the skeptics. Nevertheless I remained skeptical of Ed's case until the middle of May, after I had analyzed Ed's last photos. These were \"SRS\" camera stereo photos taken at about 1:15 AM, May 1, 1988, just before Ed had a \"missing time\" experience (which he reported to me about twelve hours after its occurrence). These stereo photos contain images of two UFOs of dif- ferent types and sizes and at different distances. The more distant UFO (\"Type 1\", about 475 feet away) was calculated to be quite large (e.g. estimated at over twenty feet across the center section and 14 feet high). It was of the same general type as he had photographed numerous times in December, 1987. The closer, smaller UFO (\"Type 3,\" 132 feet away) was different: it strongly resembled the UFO he had photographed on Feb- ruary 26 with the Nimslo stereo camera. My calculations showed that the size of this type of UFO as determined from the SRS camera photographs of May 1 was about 2.5 feet. Independent calculations for the Nimslo camera photos yielded a range of possible sizes from 2.5 to 4 feet (the Nimslo camera could not resolve distances as well as the SRS camera). In other words, the calcula- tions for the two cameras agreed upon a size of about 2.5 feet even though the distances were very dif- ferent (about 132 feet away on May 1, about 40 to 70 feet on Feb. 26) and the cameras were totally differ- ent (the Nimslo uses 35mm film, the outer stereo lenses are separated by about 2.5 inches and the focal length is about 31mm; the SRS camera is made up of two Polaroid Model 600 cameras separated by two feet and the focal length of each camera is about 110mm). I was struck by this agreement in size as i realized the dif- ficulty anyone would have in creating hoax photos with one type of stereo camera, to say nothing of two differ- ent types. I was also impressed with the May 1 photos themselves because the sighting lines to the UFOs, as deter- mined by identifiable ground lights (lights on a bridge), placed them more than a hundred feet from the beach, over the water of Santa Rosa sound. This information was presented at the MUFON symposium although it was not published in the symposium proceedings paper because the analy- sis of the May 1 photos and the Nimslo photos occurred after the paper was completed. However, this information is included in ref. 2. Limits of Disbelief By May 1 my skepticism of Ed's story was reaching its limit for many reasons including, but not limited to, the following: (a) Ed's previous SRS camera stereo photos of March 17 and 20 (references 2 and 6) that stretched the photographic hoax hy- pothesis to its limits, (b) the fact that he passed two lie detector tests given by a skeptical examiner (references 2 and 5), (c) the failure of the local investigators to find any proof of a hoax despite having Ed \"under a mic- roscope\" for several months, (d) the discovery of an unexplained circular area of dead grass, about 14 feet in diameter, in the field behind his house (references 2, 5 and 6), (e) the testimony of his wife (ref. 2), (f) the December 28 videotape which con- tains no evidence of a hanging model (ref. 2), (g) the reports of numerous sightings, including some with photo- graphs, by other people in the area; several of these occurred on some of the same days that Ed reported sight- ings (references 2, 3 and 4), (h) the sighting flap which occurred in March and April in Gulf Breeze (ref. 2), (i) Ed's obvious distress as he described to me, only twelve hours after the event, his May 1 sighting and missing time experience of the night before, (j) my failure to find any reason in Ed's background or present social status for him to want to create a UFO hoax and (k) his continual cooperation in carrying out my re- quests for information, measurements and camera tests, even though many of these requests could have resulted in the discovery of discrepancies that would be indicative of a hoax. Yet, in spite of all of these reasons I remained skeptical until I completed the calculations that established the identity between the small (\"Type 3\")"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"UFO in May 1 photos and the UFO in the Nimslo photos, as described above. The result of these calcula- tions surprised me. I spent some time trying to figure out how this result could have been hoaxed. I did dis- cover how to hoax this result, but then I realized that it would require much more technical capability than even \"normally sophisticated\" hoax techniques require (because these are stereo pictures). I subsequently reject- ed the idea that Ed or an accomplice could have done it. This was the \"last straw.\" The lim- its of my skepticism had now been surpassed. To be honest with myself I had to admit that I had not been able to find proof of a hoax and, instead, had found evidence that would be extremely difficult to hoax, assuming that a hypothetical hoaxer would even think of trying to hoax stereo photos. To be honest with myself I had to accept the idea that Ed was telling the truth (along with his wife, family and other members of the Gulf Breeze community). In other words, I concluded that his sightings were real. At the MUFON symposium I pres- ented arguments which tended to support Ed's claims so that, as I stated in the symposium proceedings, his sightings would not be rejected prematurely (i.e., before conclusive proof of a hoax was discovered). However, I did not state my conclu- sion because / mas still allowing for the possibility that someone might turn up conclusive proof that would \"break\" the case. (However, no one did come forward with conclusive proof of a hoax.) Subsequent to the MUFON sym- posium I learned of the results of personality tests administered by a clinical psychologist, Dr. Dan C. Over lade, who has publicly stated that Ed is normal by conventional standards (see the article following ref. 1 in the December MUFON Journal). I also learned that, after many hours of hypnotic regression by Dr. Overlade, Ed had described the abduction of May 1 and five previous abduction experiences (including one on Dec. 17, 1987). Thus Ed has turned out to be a \"classic\" abductee. Dr. Overlade told me that, in his 6 opinion, Ed believes what he is say- ing is true. I also had a long discussion with Harvey McLaughlin, the polygraphist. He told me that, in his opinion, Ed was not a sociopath (a type of person who is capable of passing a polygraph [lie detector] test even though lying) and that Ed was not on drugs when he took the tests. McLaughlin seconded Overlade's opinion that Ed thoroughly believes that he is telling the truth. In order to get an independent opinion of the polygraph results I asked a lawyer friend of mine who is familiar with the use of the polygraph to try to determine whether or not McLaugh- lin's test was conclusive. After he interviewed Mr. McLaughlin he told me that the test was probably as conclusive as any such test could be considering that Mr. McLaughlin had no previous experience in dealing with UFO matters. (Mr. McLaughlin had contacted Don Ware and Cha- rles Flannigan to ask them for ques- tions to use during the examination.) The lawyer agreed with McLaughlin's conclusion that the test results show that Ed believes he is telling the truth. I also learned that Ed has passed a psychological stress evaluator test (PSE) carried out by Michael Kradz of Dektor Counterintelligence and Security, Inc. The test was carried out on several taped conversations in which Ed was discussing his expe- riences. The PSE machine picked up some stress when Ed discussed his initial story about being an interme- diary for a \"Mr. X\" who, Ed originally claimed, took the photos. Since this story was, in fact, a lie (Ed took the photos, not \"Mr. X\") it is not surpris- ing that some stress should be detected here. The rest of the inter- view produced no reactions that caused the examiner to doubt Ed's answers. The same PSE examiner studied the taped interview of \"Patrick Hanks.\" He found noticeable stress at only two points: when Patrick discussed his feeling that the reason that the UFO disappeared when Ed saw him (Patrick) is that the craft can sense things through Ed (see ref. 2), and when Patrick discussed the withhold- ing of his real name and signed his pseudonym. In the first instance any communication by the craft would have to be pure speculation on Patrick's part, and such speculation might well produce some stress in his voice. In the second instance he was intentionally \"lying\" by signing an unreal name to the sighting form. The rest of the interview, including Mr. Hanks' discussion of the sighting and of the UFO, produced no evident stress, indicating that Patrick believed what he was saying. Now, over a year after the sight- ings began, what appears to be the most important evidence against the sightings has been compiled and pub- lished by H&S. The rest of this paper will discuss in detail the questions raised by H&S. I will show why, in my opinion, this \"evidence\" is insuffi- cient to contradict the mass of evi- dence which supports Ed's claims. I will show why \"the scale remains unbalanced\" in Ed's favor. Premature Publicity I agree with the criticism by Hall and Smith that there was a \"rush to judgement\" by both sides. I have already recounted my distress at learning in February, 1988, that a TV documentary had been planned on Ed's sightings even before the photos were analyzed. This \"pro\" publicity was clearly premature. Also premature was the public release, in the latter half of April, of a statement that Ed's reports were \"most probably\" a hoax. This .state- ment was made while I was still com- piling my report for the MUFON symposium. The investigators who made the statement (e.g., Robert Boyd, Ray Stanford) had not read my analyses of the stereo photos, which tended to rule out a hoax, nor did they have any of the other volume of testimonial evidence that I had com- piled and, of most importance, they had no good photographic analysis to support their statements. Neverthe- less they announced to the local Pen- sacola press and TV that Ed's sight- ings constituted a hoax (\"News Release\" dated April 18, 1988, ref. 10). Ray even wrote two long papers, based on his analysis of weather conditions and upon his analysis of the direction of motion of the clouds in Ed's first three photos, that purported to prove MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"that the first five photos could not have been taken in the order Ed reported (A Strange Breeze in Gulf Breeze and A Strange Breeze in Gulf Breeze, Part Two, ret. 11). On April 20, WEAR, the Pensacola TV station, ran a short news story in which Stan- ford's paper and the CUFOS press release were discussed. A phone conversation with Ray was shown on TV in which he explained how the weather reports and the images of clouds contradicted Ed's report. Also in that news story the Mayor, Ed Grey, stated his opinion that Ed's sightings were hoaxes. The fact that the mayor was given the opportunity to state his opinion on TV was a direct result of the CUFOS press release and Stanford's paper. Mr. Grey indicated that he was dismayed that Gulf Breeze was being made the butt of jokes and getting a \"bad image\" because of the UFO sightings. He further stated \"I believe (that) with us going on record that we believe it is a hoax that image will be turned around and we will get back to the image of it (Gulf Breeze) being a good quality place to live.\" Evi- dently Mr. Grey attached more impor- tance to the \"image\" of Gulf Breeze than to the necessity of establishing the truth or falsehood of the many UFO sightings in his fair city. It is \"amusing\" (actually depressing to one who believes that, to have any value in UFO investigation, UFO skepticism should be credible) to note that, on the very same TV show which presented Ray's claims his argument was refuted by Don Ware who showed that Ray had used the wrong sighting direction in his analy- sis. In the April 21 issue of the Pen- sacola News Journal an article based on an interview with Ray on April 20 quoted Ray as saying \"If I'm wrong, I will completely resign from the field.\" However, Ray did not resign. Instead he admitted on WEAR TV that his analysis was wrong because it was based on incorrect sighting direction information and upon partially incor- rect weather information. (Ray repeated his opinion that the sightings were a hoax, however. Ray's retraction was a result of investigation and analysis of of weather data by Ware and Robert Oechsler. Subsequent analyses by MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 Boyd and myself confirmed the Ware- Oechsler conclusion that the cloud motion is not inconsistent with what is shown in the photos.) General Basis For Skepticism H&S have pointed out that the answers to certain fundamental ques- tions have never been published. The first question they raise is what did Ed know about UFOs before Nov. 1987? What books had he read? Had he read Communion? Ed says that he has read no UFO books and has had no more than a passing interest in the subject such as one might get from seeing Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, and such movies. The investigators asked him this during the initial inter- views. When I visited his house in February, 1988, I looked at the books in his library. I saw nothing that remotely resembled a UFO book. Ed did attend the MUFON symposium in June 1988 and has taken more of an interest in the subject, as might be expected. However, the local investi- gators asked Ed, in January, 1988, to not read any UFO books and Ed has complied with this request. He states that he has not read Communion (nor Intruders) nor any of the other books presently on the market. He has never given to me any indication that he has any background in the field of UFO studies and instead has repeatedly asked questions which almost any UFO researcher could answer \"at the drop of a hat\" (I would hope). What is Ed's background and character, including his reputation as revealed by investigations? The sim- ple answer to this is, highly favorable. It is unfortunate from the point view of the investigators that Ed has requested anonymity for himself and his family. This means that the MUFON investigators have had to withhold his name from publication, although Ed is known to all the inves- tigators who have been involved, including Smith and Hall. Because Ed is a well known personality in his community his request for anonymity has also prevented the MUFON investigators from discussing his bus- iness. (Although Dr. Smith broke this confidence and publicized Ed's name and business at a late summer UFO conference, MUFON continues to honor this confidence.) In order to maintain this confidence, despite the difficulty this places me in, I will simply say that Ed's business consists of performing a certain type of per- sonal service for his customers. This service is quite expensive and suc- cess in his business depends upon him being able to gain the complete confidence of his customers and to convince them of his capability to perform the service to the customer's satisfaction for the price agreed upon. Any suggestion that he might be unreliable or incompetent to perform the service would be sufficient to cause a potential customer to request the service from one of Ed's competi- tors. This is one reason that Ed has requested anonymity. The main rea- son, however, is to avoid the impact of publicity on his family.) Ed's cus- tomers have been appreciative of his services. That is, he has been very successful because he has done his job well. Because his services have been in demand he has become wealthy, by normal standards, from his work. His success in this business attests to his truthful personality (he would not get far in his business by making grandiose promises and then failing to meet those promises). From the point of view of UFO investiga- tion his business success provides a prime reason why Ed would not want to be in any way involved with UFOs. Although Dr. Smith has suggested otherwise, the fact is that Ed is a prominent personality in his commun- ity. He is active in city affairs and in fund raising for worthy projects, most notably projects oriented toward the youth of his community. He has per- sonally donated thousands of dollars or time and money to the community and has been personally thanked by the Mayor several times for his generosity. H&S state that \"Little indication has been given of a rigorous study of Ed ... from a skeptical viewpoint.\" Whereas it is true that not much has been published which is skeptical of Ed, the fact is that the investigators did investigate Ed. Furthermore, al- though the \"negative evidence\" referred to by H&S was not published, it was 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"known to the investigators and it was analyzed. Ed refused to participate in a back- ground check, but he made no effort to prevent one. Furthermore, he did provide background information which was checkable. Intensive character checking was done by Donald Ware, Charles Flannigan, Robert Reid and Gary Watson in the early spring of 1988. Don Ware even had a \"spy\" at Ed's house numerous times starting in late November, 1987, because he suspected as early as late November that the first five photos were taken by Ed and not \"Mr. X.\" This \"spy\" was a friend of Ed's son. He attended many of the parties for teenagers which Ed has on a monthly basis. At various times he was in every room of Ed's house and was a witness to many party activities. He reported back to Dan Ware that he found nothing unusual in the house and no unusual activities at the parties, and certainly nothing remotely related to a UFO hoax. Robert Boyd and Willy Smith were informed of the failure of the \"spy\" to find any evidence of UFO hoaxing on the same day that they visited their \"secret witness\" (Mr. NM, a teenager). However, they chose to ignore the findings of the \"spy.\" Another intensive character check was done in late December, 1988, by Robert Oechsler on behalf of the Fund for UFO Research. Bob talked to several people who had employed Ed. They were fully satisfied. He also talked to others in the community who knew Ed, as have I. Everyone has given Ed a positive character reference. Ed's character has been severely tested four times by skeptical profes- sionals: twice by Mr. McLaughlin using the polygraph, once by Mr. Kradz using a PSE device and once by Dr. Overlade using a battery of psychological tests. He has been found to be entirely normal. These tests have found no evidence that would suggest that Ed had perpe- trated a UFO hoax, or any hoax, either for profit or for fun. Ed attended college where he learned the basics required to perform the ser- vice he provides. He has stated that he did not complete the course work 8 (leaving after three years) because of a \"joyriding incident.\" That was twenty years ago. Since then he has been a successful business man who has a wife and two children. Ed will eventually come forward publicly and then each person can make up his own mind as to Ed's character and credibility. MUFON Investigation How thorough and objective has the MUFON investigation been? H&S suggest that the MUFON investiga- tion was not sufficiently thorough, although ref. 2 (based on the investi- gations by the local investigators and myself) was \"admirable.\" (I agree!) They point out that in a complex case like this with its potentially great significance, \"additional analysis and replication is essential.\" I agree com- pletely. It is certainly true that not all of the questions were answered by the initial MUFON investigations. Yet, things are not as \"bad\" as H&S portray them. The investigation by the local MUFON members and by myself has been supplemented by the investigations of numerous others who are residents of the area or who have traveled to Gulf Breeze to try to discover \"the truth.\" Most notable of the latter are Walter Andrus (who has visited Gulf Breeze three times), Budd Hopkins (who has visited three times), James Falvo, George Filer, James Moseley and Robert Oechsler. Mr. Andrus' reports on the case have been published in the MUFON Jour- nal (references 3-9). Budd Hopkins has communicated his findings pri- vately. Mr. Falvo talked to a number of people in the area and found nothing to contradict the results of the MUFON investigation. His find- ings were reported in a letter (ref. 12). Mr. Filer, an ex-Army intelligence officer and a State Section Director for MUFON in New Jersey, traveled to Gulf Breeze where he talked to numerous \"people on the street\" as well as to Ed. Not only did he find no reason to disbelieve Ed's claims, he further found out that virtually eve- ryone in Gulf Breeze either has seen a UFO such as Ed reported or knows someone who has (ref. 13). Mr. Mose'.ey spent 16 hours interviewing Ed on Dec. 16 and 17, 1988. Although he had been very skeptical of Ed's reports (and had publicly called the sightings a probable hoax), he found no proof that Ed had perpetrated a hoax and he even began to question the accuracy of Ed's critics (ref. 14). The results of Mr. Oechsler's investi- gation were similar to those of Andrus, Hopkins, Falvo, Filer and Moseley. He found strong evidence of Ed's good character and good standing in the community (ref. 14). The local TV and Pensacola news- paper reporters were on the scene continually. Mark Curtis of WEAR TV conducted numerous interviews with the witnesses, including Ed, with the local investigators and with Ray Stanford and Robert Boyd. Curtis investigated various aspects of the sightings and did a rather extensive photographic evaluation which included several attempts, using several pho- tographers, to duplicate Ed's photos. (He failed.) Reporters David Richard- son and Mike Burke investigated the sightings for the Pensacola News Journal. They confronted Ed with one of Dr. Smith's calculations which purportedly showed that Ed had been \"lying\" about the distances to the UFOs in one photo. When Ed pro- tested that Smith's calculated dis- tance was wrong the reporters mea- sured it and found that it was, indeed, wrong. (This made them skeptical of Dr. Smith's calculations.) They, too, found no evidence that proved that Ed's sightings were a hoax. Several \"documentarians\" have travel- ed to Gulf Breeze. Most notable of these are the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" TV crew (Kris Palmer and Asso- ciates), and the \"UFO Cover-Up Live\" TV crew (headed by Tracy Torme). These people interviewed Ed and numerous other witnesses. They were impressed with Ed and disco- vered, as had many investigators before them, that Ed is far from alone in reporting sightings. Consistent with what I reported in ref. 2 (that there were many witnesses in the area), the Unsolved Mysteries filmed about 30 people who admitted to hav- ing seen a UFO. They featured two of the most priminent Gulf Breeze civili- ans, Dr. Fenner McConnell (the dis- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"trict coroner) and his wife as they described their sighting of July, 1988. They found no evidence that Ed's sightings were a hoax. Tracy Torme talked with many witnesses, including Ed. He became thoroughly convinced of the realty of the sightings. During the UFO Cover- Up Live TV show there were several dozen witnesses present in the audit- orium where the Gulf Breeze seg- ment was filmed. A TV station from Miami also investigated Ed's reports in the fall of 1988. This TV station presented a show that was completely from the skeptical viewpoint. Featured on the show was a photo which, it was claimed, indicated that Ed knew how to make double exposure photos with his Polaroid camera. I will discuss this photo later on. However, for the present suffice it to say that the pic- ture does not prove that Ed knew how to make a double exposure. The reporters who put this show together were not able to find any convincing proof that any of the Gulf Breeze sightings were a hoax. The point of this discussion is that, although the local MUFON investiga- tion was definitely weak (because of a lack of manpower in the face of an extremely large number of reports), it was supplemented by many other investigators from various professional backgrounds. In a sense Ed, and the whole of Gulf Breeze, has been under a \"microscope\" for over a year now. One would suspect that if a hoax were involved someone would have found some conclusive proof some- where. The fact is that, after a year of investigation by numerous people, no one (and this includes the skepti- cal investigators) has yet stepped forward to say \"I can prove that the photos and sightings are a hoax.\" How do the Gulf Breeze incidents fit in with' UFO history? Here H&S argue that \"basically they don't fit very well,\" i.e., the incidents reported in Gulf Breeze fall outside the norm of the historical phenomenon. In par- ticular they suggest that Ed's sight- ings and photos are so inconsistent with UFO history that they probably constitute a hoax. Actually this argument is a double edged sword: it \"curs both ways.\" MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 One could just as well argue that a hoaxer would attempt to make his reports consistent with UFO history in order to be believed. Therefore one could argue with equal force that because Ed's sighting reports are so unusual they are probably real. There is no doubt that H&S are partially right: certain aspects of the sightings do fall outside the norm, particularly the number of photos taken by one person. However, cer- tain major aspects of the Gulf Breeze sightings are consistent with UFO history even though they are unusual: â¢ The occurrence of a large number of sightings in a short period of time in a small region is called a concen- tration. Excluding Ed's sightings, the sightings of the other Gulf Breeze residents are unusual only in regard to the duration of this concentration which ran basically from November (1987) through the middle of April (1988). â¢ It is true that the number of sightings by Ed himself (and his fam- ily) is anomalous from the historical point of view and, in fact, would have been considered grounds for dismiss- ing them ten or more years ago. (Repeaters are not \"welcome\" in UFO history.) However, in recent years we have learned from abduc- tion experience reports that repeti- tion is the rule rather than the excep- tion. Historically, i.e., ten, twenty, thirty, etc. years ago such an idea would have been considered heresy. However, the work of Budd Hopkins and Dave Jacobs, as well as of numerous other abduction researchers (and abductees such as Whitley Streiber) has shown that, not only might a per- son have an abduction experience several times in a lifetime, but even several times in a year. As I have already pointed out, Dr. Overlade's work with Ed has shown that he has had several abduction experiences in his lifetime, including the experience on May 1, and a (recently revealed) experience on December 17, 1987. Thus, as an abductee, Ed's multiple sightings are less \"outside the norm.\" â¢ Where the Gulf Breeze sightings clearly fall outside the norm of accepted sightings is in the number of photo- graphs. Previously, investigations of people who have taken a large number of UFO photos have turned up highly suspicious photographic and non-photographic evidence that strongly points toward a hoax. Thus Ed's case immediately came under suspicion. However, Ed's reports act- ually fall outside the norm for hoax- ing. Previously large numbers of pho- tos have been produced by UFO \"contactees\" who have had some pseudo-religious message to give to mankind (from the \"Space Brothers,\" of course). If Ed had made any effort to promote his sightings, to reveal \"new and important information from the Space Brothers\" or if he had done any of the other things that have been done by \"contactees\" in the past (report on trips to other planets or accept donations from \"fol- lowers,\" for example) the local inves- tigators would have dismissed Ed's sightings early in the spring of 1988. However, there are no contactee aspects to Ed's reports. Since Ed's reports are not consistent with the history of UFO photo hoaxes one cannot argue that his sightings must be a hoax because he took lots of pictures. (Ed is clearly not a contactee.) Besides the fact of the unusually large number of photos by one per- son, there is also the fact that the depicted UFOs are highly unusual and do not \"fit in with UFO history.\" As H&S have pointed out, the depicted UFOs have even been called \"hokey,\" but this description could apply to many UFOs which are con- ventionally accepted (e.g., the Trent photos â McMinnville, Oregon, 1950 â in which the UFO has a \"pole\" on the top which is off center and tilted). But is this a reason to reject their reality in favor of a hoax? I think not. A hoaxer, it would seem to me (as I stated above) would be more likely to make his UFOs fit in with main- stream ufohgy rather than be unique. Certainly many \"acceptable designs\" would be available in the literature. I conclude that the fact that Ed's sightings fall outside the norms of UFO history is not convincing proof that they constitute a hoax. The Photographs Besides referring to \"hokiness\" as a reason for questioning Ed's photos, H&S 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"have also pointed out that several seem \"stagey,\" as if constructed for the benefit of the viewers. However, these photos are consistent with the verbal reports which accompany them and the verbal reports do not suggest \"staginess.\" At any rate, although, as H&S have said, experience certainly \"does count for something,\" \"hokiness\" and \"staginess\" are subjective impressions. As H&S point out, \"intuitive impres- sions of UFO photographs do not, alone, constitute science; objective analysis must be done.\" The first photos which they discuss analytically are #22 and #23 which were, accord- ing to Ed, his wife and his daughter, taken by Ed's wife. Number 23, in particular could not have been taken by Ed inasmuch as Ed appears in the photo (in a towel). The story behind these photos is summarized in refer : ences 2 and 5. H&S quote Zan Overall as claiming that \"the picture contains convincing evidence to him that the object was flashlit and model sized.\" Mr. Overall and I have had a running discussion of these pictures since he first asked me about them at the MUFON symposium. I had, indeed, considered the possibility that a model had been used to make these photos, just as I had considered the possibil- ity for all of the photos. In these pho- tos, as in the others, I also had con- sidered the possibility, favorable to Ed, that the illumination was from the object itself. If one could prove that the main body of the UFO in photos 22 and 23 (and in the others) was not luminous (i.e., not a source of light) then it must have been illum- inated by an external source. (Note: no one questions the idea that the brightest parts of the depicted UFOs, i.e., the \"top light\" and the \"bottom ring\" must be sources of light; this argument only applies to the dimmer central body parts.) The most likely external source for photos 22 and 23 would be the camera flash itself which illuminated foreground features that appear in the pictures. I asked Ed to carry out a series of tests to determine just what the range of the flash was. Experiments with his old Polaroid showed that it was about 40 feet at the most. (I carried out similar tests and found results consistent 10 with what Ed reported.) Based on these experiments it appears that, to get an image of the main body of the UFO as bright as it appears on the photos using flash illumination only, it would require that the UFO be within 20 feet or so of the camera. In this case the UFO would be small, i.e. model-sized. The preceding discussion says that if the main body of the UFO were not luminous then it was probably a nearby model. Therefore the key question is could the main body have been luminous and therefore beyond the range of the flash? H&S pointed out in a footnote that I have disco- vered evidence that the UFOs which Ed photographed are self-luminous. This evidence comes from two sour- ces: first, the December 28 videotape, and second, the March 17 stereo photographs (references 2, 3 and 6). The videotape clearly proves that the central body of the \"Type 1\" craft that Ed photographed could be but did not have to be luminous. In the first half of the videotape the central body is easily seen between the \"top light\" and the very bright \"bottom ring\" lights. In the second half of the videotape the central body is invisible even though the top light,and bottom ring are clearly visible. The second element of proof that the central body of the UFO can be luminous is contained in the March 17 stereo photos. The distance to the object, as calculated from the stereo effect, is estimated to be well over 130 feet and probably even greater than 180 feet. Yet, in spite of this great distance, which is far beyond the distance at which the flash could have any observable effect on the film image, the central portion is (barely) visible. Admittedly this second element of proof assumes that the March 17 photos were not, themselves, some- how hoaxed. However, I have inves- tigated the circumstances under which they were taken and have concluded that under the conditions pertaining at the time, ro fake stereo photos of a hoax object almost in the presence of several people and to have these photos develop as these people watched would require photographic capabili- ties far beyond those of most profes- sional photographers and certainly far beyond any capability that Ed has demonstrated. The \"discovery\" that the UFOs photographed by Ed can have lumi- nous bodies is not a major discovery about UFOs themselves. For years luminous shapes have been reported during nighttime sightings. Thus \"Ed's UFOs,\" although shaped differently from previous UFOs, have this as one of several characteristics in common with other UFOs, with silence, maneuverability and high speed travel being other common characteristics. H&S have pointed out that the first nine photos deserve particular atten- tion because they \"established\" the photographic context of Ed's sight- ings. Several of these photographs have been subjected to computer- aided analysis, as H&S have sug- gested (the computer analysis was done late last spring, long before the H&S suggestion). They have also been analyzed extensively using con- ventional photo enhancement tech- niques. H&S have claimed to find \"several problems with the early pho- tographs.\" In particular, they say that \"Nos. 1 and 7 show UFO images closely adjacent to and possibly ouer- lapping a foreground tree. An over- lapping image would suggest a double exposure.\" (my emphasis) Computer analysis done by Dr. Mark Carlatto of The Analytical Sciences Corpora- tion (Boston) failed to find any indica- tion that the images of the UFOs overlapped the tree images in either of these photos. This finding is con- sistent with what I determined from conventional analysis and it was con- firmed again by Robert Oechsler who has done an extensive photo analysis using conventional techniques. Dr. Robert Nathan at JPL also failed to find evidence of image overlap (see Appendix 1). The fact that the UFO images do nof overlap the tree images does not rule out a hoax, but it does make the hoax much more difficult. To use a double exposure technique to create one image \"behind\" another would require a matted double exposure in which an opaque object of the same outline shape as the UFO (a \"cutout\") is used to block the portion of the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"background where the UFO would appear while the exposure of the background scene is made. This is quite difficult to do well even under \"laboratory\" conditions such as in a professional studio. The \"double exposure\" was one photographic technique investigated experimentally by Mark Curtis of WEAR in Pensacola and by several other photographers who helped him. They found that to produce a double exposure hoax of a UFO silhouetted against the clear sky was quite easy. But to make the UFO appear to be behind the tree using the double exposure method was beyond their capability. (Curtis also investigated the \"reflection on a windowpane\" technique and found that even more difficult.) H&S have stated that \"Photos 1-3 show a surprisingly invariant back- ground for allegedly having been taken hurridly with a Polaroid camera by someone who had to lower and raise the camera between exposures. Contrary to the witness's story, this suggests the use of a tripod or other stabilizing surface.\" This is a not-well- thought-out criticism because it is easily explained. Furthermore, the statement is wrong in its basic claim that the background is \"invariant.\" By examining the parallax effect (position shift) between the image of the left edge of the nearby (ca. 4 feet) tree and the image of the distant (ca. 70 feet) light pole one can easily see that the second picture was taken from a position that was a few inches (at least) ahead (i.e., west) of the first picture, and that the third picture was taken from a location slightly behind the second. Thus the horizon- tal position was not invariant. The vertical position was, however, quite constant. But this does not mean that the camera was on a tripod. Since Ed sighted through the camera before each shot he obviously placed the viewfinder to his eye. He did not report bending over or stretching upward to take a picture. It is there- fore reasonable to theorize that his eye, and thus the camera, was always the same height to within a fraction of an inch, even if he did raise and lower the camera. The obvious corol- lary of this is that the camera was MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 always at the same height when the picture was taken. Consequently the claim that the camera must have been mounted on a tripod is not sup- ported by the pictures nor by the \"theory\" that Ed's eyeball would have been at the same height for the first three pictures. (When I suggested this theory as an explanation for the constancy of the position of the camera to Robert Oechsler he was skeptical. He tested this \"constant eyeball height\" theory during his December investigation. He asked Ed to take three pictures from the same location on his front doorstep from a point very close to where his UFO pictures had been taken. Ed did not move between the pictures. One can see from the paral- lax between the nearby tree and the distant light pole and wires that the altitude and position of the camera were constant to within an inch even though Ed raised and lowered the camera between pictures.) H&S have claimed that there are \"vertical line markings suggestive of supports for a UFO model\" that appear in some early photos (in par- ticular, photo #5). These lines have been analyzed extensively using con- ventional and computer-aided tech- niques and have been found to be flaws in the development mechanism and chemical process. They are found in non-UFO pictures as well as at various locations in some of Ed's UFO pictures. The lines usually do not intersect the UFO images, but in some pictures they do. The line in photo #5 in particular runs from the top of the picture to the bottom and passes right through the image of the UFO. As H&S pointed out in a foot- note, computer aided analysis has made it clear that this is a film flaw and not a supporting thread for the UFO (see Appendix 1). (Robert Nathan at JPL told me that he, too, was unable to find evidence of supports for the UFOs.) H&S have claimed that non-symme- tries in the images of the first UFOs, in particular the irregularly spaced \"windows,\" could \"easily\" be \"inter- preted as evidence of a distorted image due to photographic trickery or a crude model.\" The \"distortion\" they refer to is the irregular \"window\" spacing in some of the UFO images. This irregular spacing is not likely a result of photographic trickery since any optical effect which could pro- duce that magnitude of distortion of the \"window\" position would produce large, easily noticed distortions of the whole UFO image. The irregularities could be attributed to a poorly made model, although from what I know of Ed it seems unlikely to me that if Ed were to make a model it would be poorly made. The irregularity could also be an actual feature of the UFO as viewed from different angles, or perhaps these rectangular dark patches which have been loosely referred to as \"windows\" do not have fixed loca- tions on the craft, i.e., they might move left or right from nominal posi- tions. (They might not be \"windows\" as we think of windows as being part of the physical structure of a craft and therefore fixed in position relative to the structure of the craft.) I reiterate what I stated in ref. 2: we don't know what UFOs are sup- posed to look like. No one can say that a UFO cannot have irregularities or non-symmetries, just as our own transportation devices have non-sym- metries, (as well as symmetries). From the point of view of establishing or \"disestablishing\" Ed's photos as real the operative question is, are the non-symmetries sufficient ground to prove that the photos are hoaxes? In the absence of any information that would strongly support Ed's case and if there were other substantial evi- dence, photographic and non-photo- graphic that pointed toward a hoax, these non-symmetries could be a deciding factor in calling the photos a hoax. But, in view of the voluminous other positive evidence that supports Ed's claims and the lack of convinc- ing contrary evidence, I think not. H&S quote Robert Boyd as saying that Photo 6 contains \"strong evi- dence of double exposure.\" I pre- sume that he has based his statement on my claim in ref. 2 that \"Photo 6 appears to provide pictorial evidence that argues for such a hoax.\" I made this statement because in photo 6 the images of the distant power wires and streetlight are somewhat smeared in the vertical direction whereas the image of the UFO does not appear to 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"be vertically smeared by image motion, although it is a bit fuzzy around the edges. The different amounts of motion smear in this picture could have been created in only two ways: (a) (the real picture hypothesis) the camera panned with the UFO as it moved (downw- ard) while a single exposure was made, or (b), (the double exposure hoax hypothesis) the camera moved upward (or downward) slightly as the first (or second) exposure was made of the background but was steady as the second (or first) exposure of the UFO model was made. If there were no other photographic evidence in this case then the double exposure hypothesis would be preferred and the photo might well be thrown out on this account. However, there are equally impressive \"smeared image data\" which argue againsf a hoax. In photo 1 the motion smear of the image of the UFO is in the same direction and has the same magni- tude as the smear of the background (as determined mainly by the smear of the streetlight image) as nearly as can be determined. This is easy to explain if the picture were a single exposure. If the picture were a dou- ble exposure it would mean that the camera was vibrated in exactly the same way (by hand motion or for whatever reason) during both expo- sures; not an impossibility, but highly unlikely for a hand-held camera. Photo 4 also is smeared with the smear of the UFO image and the smear of the image of the light being identical. Thus in my opinion the image smear data are a wash: one photo (#6) has differential smears indicative of a double exposure and two photos (#1, #4) have identical smears indicative of a single expo- sure. Since the differential smear in a single picture can be explained with- out resort to the hoax hypothesis, i.e., it can be explained as a result of panning of the camera as the UFO moved, it is not possible to use photo 6 to prove that the photos are hoaxes. \"Road Shot\" & Other Photos On January 13, Ed reported to Charles Flannigan that he had been confronted by a UFO and aliens while driving along route 191-B the 12 evening before. The events are sum- marized in references 2 and 3. In ref. 2, I erroneously claimed that the photo was taken from a location to the right of the center of the cab. Ed did not remember it that way (he recalled being just to the right of the steering wheel), but I disputed his recollection basing my conclusion on my experiments at the site. However, an extensive analysis of reflections in the hood of the truck, done after the MUFON Symposium, has proved that Ed was correct: the photo was taken from a location to the left of the center and it shows the left hand windshield wiper. H&S stated that, after the white illumination came through the wind- shield and caused Ed to swerve the truck off to the left side of the road, he \"reached for his shotgun behind the seat, then changed his mind and took the photograph (my emphasis).\" Actually he didn't \"change his mind.\" As stated in ref. 2, he pulled the seat forward, grasped the shotgun and placed it on the seat beside him. After he had the shotgun he reached for the camera and took the picture. Although Ed didn't report any rain or effects of rain during his encounter on the road, Walter Andrus (ref. 3) conjectured the bright spots in the photo might have been caused by rain drops on the windshield reflect- ing light from the bottom of the UFO. This suggestion seemed reasonable considering that the clouds in the sky might have been rainclouds. In ref. 2 I also suggested that there had been rain and that the road was wet. (In the original symposium report I, too, suggested that the bright spots in the picture might be reflections from raindrops on the windshield. I subse- quently discovered that the spots are actually tiny holes in the emulsion. The suggestion of reflections from raindrops was removed from the revised version of the symposium paper as presented in ref. 2.) The assumption that there had been rain and that consequently the road was wet is now known to be wrong. Had the local investigators obtained the weather report for that day soon after the event they would have found, as Robert Oechsler did many months later (in December, 1988), that there had been no measureable precipitation for several days preced- ing January 12,1988. H&S have, unfortunately, built an argument against the reality of the photo on their exaggeration of my error regarding the rain: they claimed that the \"environment was dripping with moisture.\" They protest that because of the wetness there should be reflec- tions of light from the nearby vegeta- tion as well as from the road and that Ed should have mentioned encounter- ing the effects of wet ground. Ed didn't mention being wet and muddy as a result of crawling under his truck. (Now we know why Ed didn't mention being wet â there was no rain. He wouldn't have been muddy from crawling on the ground anyway because the ground at that location, like most of coastal Florida, is sand, a fact that should have been known to Willy Smith, if not to Richard Hall. The sand does not hold water and is not as sticky as mud.) Although the suggestion that there should have been numerous \"envir- onmental reflections\" because of the presumed wetness is wrong, their suggestion that there should be a reflection from the hood of the truck is still worthy of consideration since the hood, being a smooth surface, would reflect light whether it was wet or not. The problem of the lack of a reflection in the hood was researched in the late summer of 1988. By hold- ing a flashlight at various heights above the road and about 200 feet away it was determined that no reflection in the hood appeared until the light was seven or more feet above the road. This is because the front of the hood was bent by a colli- sion in the fall of 1986. The effect of the bend is visible in the \"road shot\" itself: the front edge of the hood is \"outlined\" by a relatively bright reflec- tion of the sky. If the hood hadn't been bent the dark ground ahead of the truck would appear reflected by the front of the hood rather than the sky. Since the bright bottom of the UFO was less than 4 feet above the road (see ref. 2) it was below the min- imum height that would reflect into the camera from the bent hood. H&S have protested that Ed's behavior, \"after being semiparalyzed MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"by a manifestly alien apparition ... is not what you would typically expect.\" That may be true, but then, H&S weren't there to actually experience what Ed experienced. H&S go on to sug- gest that instead of firing the gun at the UFO Ed \"casually\" took a pic- ture. The use of the word \"casually\" is highly inappropriate. Ed has said that nothing he did during that time was \"casual.\" He did manage to get a picture, but he did so as quickly as he could, before the UFO moved back toward the truck (where it zapped him a second time as he crawled underneath). H&S point out that the videotape requires extensive analysis with the full application of \"checks and balan- ces of the scientific method.\" They are correct and I am surprised that Dr. Smith did not do some of this \"extensive analysis\" of the videotape himself. Most of it has been available to researchers ever since it was shown on the WEAR TV documen- tary in March, 1988. Furthermore, Ed has made numerous copies for peo- ple to work on. Much of what I have done could have been done by anyone with a good stop-frame Video Cassette Recorder and a copy of the TV documentary. (However, I worked from a first generation VHS copy of Ed's 8mm video original.) By carefully measuring frame by frame the motion of the UFO relative to fixed distant street and building lights I determined that the UFO did not exhibit any of the characteristics of a simple hang- ing model (such as appears in one of Billy Meier's movie segments). Robert Oechsler and Edward Weibe (a God- dard Space Flight Center employee) used some very sophisticated video equipment to study the motion. Com- paring the UFO video with a daylight reconstruction by Ed they determined that the UFO went on the other side of a tree that lies behind Ed's house, outside his fenced yard, at a distance of about 50 feet from the camera position. I made a schematic recon- struction (diagram) of Ed's back yard and, with the aid of an excellent stop- frame VHS machine (which I pur- chased just for this analysis!) I con- firmed that the UFO went behind a tree. I also found that, at the very beginning of the videotape, it went on MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 the far side of a windscreen board that was about 20 feet from the camera and that is adjacent to Ed's pool. This suggested that the UFO was quite far away over the field in back of Ed's house, consistent with what Ed said had happened. I tried to imagine how the motion of the UFO on the videotape could have been created by a model. I con- cluded that the model would have to move along a rigid track that would be more than thirty feet away, more than 60 feet long and ten or so feet above the ground. This track would have to be built outside Ed's yard and sloped downward (i.e., not level). Whereas it would be possible to build such a track, it is likely that it would have been seen by someone in Ed's neighborhood. I studied the variations in bright- ness from frame-to-frame of the top and bottom UFO lights. I found that the fluctuations in brightness of the lights on the UFO are basically ran- dom as opposed to periodic. I found this by using the stop-frame VCR in combination with a \"frame grabber\" and associated computer analysis equip- ment to measure the peak frame-by- frame (voltage) of the UFO lights as recorded on the videotape. I asked Ed to carry out some experiments with his video camera. These involved filming known lights (incandescent flashlight bulbs, a fluorescent light) at known distances. The tests showed that random brightness fluctuations comparable to those of the UFO lights also occur in a videotape of a very small steady light source (a flashlight bulb) if it is filmed from a distance of several hundred feet or more. Considering this result from the point of the hoax hypothesis this would require a random amplitude modulation at a high rate of speed (1/30 sec) of a light on a nearby model. If the model used battery powered steady lights it would have to be hundreds of feet away and therefore quite large. At such a dis- tance the rigid track framework referred to in the above paragraph would have to be several hundred feet long, twenty or so feet above the ground and quite close to the school build- ings on the far side of the field behind Ed's house. My study of the UFO dynamics, the flight track and the brightness fluctuations has led me to conclude that it would have been somewhere between extremely difficult and vir- tually impossible for Ed to have faked the video. H&S have also referred to the Nimslo camera photos. The Nimslo camera photographic data indicated that the UFO was between 40 and 70 feet away (see ref. 2). Since the actual length of the UFO was calcu- lated from the image size and from the calculated distance (actual size = image size times distance divided by focal length), the result is a size range 2.5 to 4 feet, rather than a specific size. H&S point out that \"A sup- posed alien spacecraft of that size could only accommodate very tiny beings.\" This is a \"cute\" but unneeded statement. If they were sufficiently astute they would have noticed that in the May 1 photos, in which the Type 3 UFO was found to be 2.5 feet long and about 130 feet away, there was also a much larger craft esti- mated to be more than twenty feet at its maximum diameter and 14 feet high at a distance of about 475 feet. As I reported at the MUFON sympo- sium this larger craft moved very quickly (in a few seconds) over Ed where he saw it above him just before he \"whited out\" (and was abducted). Presumably it was this larger craft, and not the small one, which was involved in the abduction. (Perhaps the smaller craft is a \"scout ship.\") Other Witnesses H&S state that, despite the \"hordes of investigators, newsmen and towns- people that were staked out in Gulf Breeze at the height of Ed's encoun- ters, not one ever witnessed Ed tak- ing a photograph or separately wit- nessed a UFO that coincided with one of Ed's reports, while he took some 40 pictures over a six-month period.\" How H&S could make this state- ment in a supposedly scientific article, I don't know. Perhaps they didn't really read the available literature. Or perhaps they are saying indirectly that they don't believe there are any other valid sightings in Gulf Breeze. If 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the latter is true, they should offer explanations for the other of the sightings rather than simply assert, in an indirect way, that there were no oth- er sightings. First of all, the premise of this statement is false: there were no \"hordes\" of any type \"staked out.\" Most of the townspeople didn't know who the photographer was and Ed's sightings were late at night when people were in their houses and not outside looking for UFOs. The four local MUFON investigators (Ware, Flannigan, Reid and Watson) did the best they could and even had a hot- line to Ed starting in January, 1988. For a couple of weeks they main- tained a late night vigil, but eventually it was too much for them (after work- ing all day) so they gave up. During one of these \"stakeouts\" (Jan. 21) Ed did have a brief sighting, but the MUFON investigator (Reid) and Ed were separated by several hundred feet when it occurred. Ed tried to describe the location of the UFO as seen against the background sky using the walkie-talkie communicators they used to maintain contact. How- ever, not knowing the names of con- stellations he could not tell Bob Reid where to look and Bob looked in the wrong direction. Ed ran to him, but the UFO was gone by the time Ed reached him to point it out. The H&S claim that \"not one ever ... seperately witnessed a UFO that coincided with one of Ed's reports\" is at least misleading, if not just plain wrong, depending upon what is meant by \"coincided with one of Ed's reports.\" At the MUFON symposium I pres- ented a graph of the sighting reports as a function of the day from Nov. 11 through May 1. I showed that on Nov. 11 there were 7 reports other than Ed's. (Since then I have learned that there was another sighting, by Art Hufford and his wife, which was during the second week of November and could well have been on Nov. 11. See Appendix 2 for a listing of sight- ings.) The sightings by Charlie Some- rby and his wife occurred only min- utes before Ed's sightings. They claimed that the photos showed what they saw. When the Somerby's last saw the UFO it was headed in the direc- tion of Ed's house. Mrs. Billie Zammit 14 reported to the newspaper that she saw a UFO at about 2:30 AM that same day, i.e., about twelve hours before Ed's sighting (see references 2 and 4). There were other sightings that have been reported (ref. 2) including the one by Jeff Thompson. However, I would like to single out this sighting for a special discussion because of the way the public skepticism impact- ed on Mr. Thompson's decision to come forward publicly with his story. According to Mr. Thompson, at 8:10 AM on Nov. 11 he saw the same type of UFO that Ed photographed. He reported his sighting to the Sen- fine/ on Nov. 20 (the day after Ed's pictures were published; see ref. 2 for a brief summary of his description). Unfortunately he left no address or phone number where he could be reached (he had no phone of his own) so the local investigators wer- en't able to contact him for a direct interview. Furthermore, he did not respond to a public appeal for wit- nesses to come forward. However, on June 24, 1988, Mr. Thompson walked into the WEAR TV studio and said that he was upset over the pub- lic skepticism about Ed's photos. He said that he had watched a recent (June 23?) TV special \"follow up\" story on the photos in which reporter Mark Curtis investigated some possi- ble ways that Ed might have hoaxed his photos (Mark Curtis tested sev- eral methods for hoaxing but failed to produce convincing photos!). On the same show Robert Boyd claimed that Ed's sightings were \"most probably a hoax.\" Mr. Thompson told Mr. Curtis that he decided to tell his story pub- licly because he knew what he had seen. He said that he was \"tired of one man taking all the heat.\" Several weeks later Jeff was inter- viewed by Charles Flannigan. He repeated in greater detail the sighting information which was presented in the Nov. 25, 1987 issue of the Sen- fine/. He also provided a sketch of an object similar to Ed's \"Type 1\" UFO. In August Jeff agreed to be on NBC TV's \"Unsolved Mysteries\" show about the Gulf Breeze sightings (which was shown on Oct. 5). During the pre- show interview (in August) he stated \"They were saying that the pictures were fakes. And I was maintaining a low profile for a while. But then it started kind of ticking me off because the man that took the pictures ... (and the other witnesses are) ... all upstanding people of the community. (So) I came forward then, you know, letting them know that I did see it that day.\" The interviewer asked him, \"Did it make you kind of angry that people were saying this was a hoax?\" Jeff responded, \"Yeah, it did. But I can understand, maybe, them saying that, you know. Something that sup- posedly doesn't exist, you have to see it to actually believe it.\" It is amusing to realize that this very important witness came forward be- cause of the public skepticism. Two more witnesses who reacted to the skepticism in the same way are chemist Arthur Hufford and his wife. They saw a UFO in Pensacola during the second week of November, 1987. (Nov. 11 was in the middle of that week.) Mr. Hufford was also on the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" show. He told the interviewer that he had not read of the sightings in the Gulf Breeze Sentinel (because he lives in Pensac- ola) and that it wasn't until late Feb- ruary, 1988, when the Sentinel pub- lished a four-page special section on Ed's sightings and photos, that he \"realized something bigger had hap- pened. It wasn't just a one time affair in November. That there was some- thing strange going on.\" He then went on to say that he became aware of the controversy but he knew that it wasn't a hoax because \"I had seen it in the sky, and nobody was playing with mirrors on my windshield on my car ... if there was a hoax involved, it wasn't the photographer pulling the hoax.\" At that point Mr. Hufford started to \"come out of the closet.\" He informed some of his friends that the sightings were serious. He went on to say \"I was bothered when I read particularly one of the debunkers that was quoted in the paper, said it was obviously a hoax, and he wasn't even going to look at the photo- graphs. And I just ... I just laughed because this is crazy, beause it is real.\" (Note: Philip Klass is quoted in the May 21 issue of the Pensacola News Journal as saying that there is MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"only a \"one in a jillion chance\" that the Gulf Breeze photos are authentic, and \"I have not personally investigated. I wouldn't waste the time. I only investigate those (sightings) that might be genuinely impressive to the pub- lic.\" Assuming that \"jillion\" is a very large number, it would appear that Believer Phil was up to his old tricks, calling a sighting a hoax before inves- tigating it.) The relevance of Hufford's testimony to Ed's photos is clear from a statement made during that same interview: \"I'm convinced that what I saw was the same thing that was photographed on November llth and published in the Sentinel. There's just no doubt in my mind that this photographer took pictures of wha- tever it was that we saw\" (my emphasis). Other dates of \"coincidental\" sight- ings reported by people not related to Ed are Dec. 2, (2 others), Feb. 26 (2), Mar. 17 (3), and Mar. 20 (4) (see Appendix 2). On Dec. 27, \"Patrick Hanks\" (pseudonym), a friend of Ed's family, saw the UFO at the same time that Ed and his family saw it. No picture was taken, however (see ref. 2). On Jan. 24 Duane Cook, the edi- tor of the Sentinel, filmed Ed with a video camera as Ed took a picture of a UFO. (Compare this fact with the H&S statement that \"no one [person] ever witnessed Ed taking a photo- graph.\") However, Duane did not see the UFO himself. He was looking at Ed, in the opposite direction to the UFO, which appeared so briefly that Ed didn't have time to point it out (he just barely had time to take a pic- ture). Duane did watch the UFO photo develop only minutes after Ed had taken the picture with his old Polaroid. On March 17 several witnesses saw Ed set up and load the SRS (stereo) camera in Shoreline Park (see ref. 2). They watched as he took test photos. Subsequently they left Ed's vicinity for a short time but they did not leave the park. The saw the SRS camera flashes and returned quickly and saw the newly taken stereo pic- tures of a UFO develop as they watched. On the same night, City Councilwoman Brenda Pollack reported a glowing object moved in the sky over Gulf Breeze. She saw it only MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 minutes before Ed took his SRS pho- tos. When she last saw it, it was mov- ing in a direction toward the area where Ed's camera was pointed when he took the SRS pictures. H&S have stated that the \"more than 130 other cases claimed are â as of this writing â either weak and not supportive of Ed's sightings or not yet even investigated.\" This state- ment is wrong on several counts. First, I know of no one who has claimed that there are 130 other cases. In ref. 2 I stated that I had found 55 \"non-Ed\" reports and that many of these were multiple luifness sightings. This led me to claim that there were probably well over a hundred witnesses. I gathered these reports from the Sentinel newspaper stories. At the time that I wrote ref. 2 most of those sightings had not been investigated, and that condition is still true. However, well over a dozen of the most significant reports have been investigated (see Appendix 2). These reports are certainly not \"weak\" and they do support Ed's sightings. Robert Oechsler, during his December investigation, learned that there were more witnesses than had been reported to the paper. The results of his inves- tigation will be reported elsewhere. H&S have claimed that most of the photographs show the UFO in \"exactly the same orientation toward the camera.\" In particular, the \"bottom is tilted slightly toward the camera.\" The significance of this fact for the hoax hypothesis is not 'clear. Ed stated that the UFO rocked back and forth and sideways slightly and that he intentionally took the photos when the UFO was brightest. Since the bottom was the brightest part this meant that he took the photos, whe- never possible, when the bottom was tilted toward him. Character Issue As I have already pointed out, it is difficult to present a clear description of the character of a person who wishes public anonymity. However, he is known to many people in Gulf Breeze, including many who don't know that he has taken photos. Peo- ple who have worked with him, including businessmen, community leaders, teachers, etc. judge him to be a man of good character and not a man who would create harmful pranks or hoaxes. H&S have pointed out that Ed uses two different last names. My response to this is a big \"So What?\" He has never tried to hide his identity from any investigator (including Smith, Hall, Boyd and Stanford). He uses the names of both his father and his stepfather alternately. By either name he is well known in the community. H&S have accused the local inves- tigators of not following up leads that they have supplied but rather of ask- ing Ed for the answers to skeptical questions. (Actually the leads have been followed up over the many months that this investigation has preceded, although not totally by the local investigators.) Their chief com- plaint is that the investigators did not follow up on \"reports\" (note the plu- ral) \"that Ed had produced deliberate double exposure photographs\" (note the word \"deliberate\" and use of the plural of photograph) \"of 'ghosts' for party purposes and had bragged to local teenagers\" (note the plural of teenager) \"that he was going to pull off the 'ultimate' prank which they would recognize when they saw it.\" The claim that Ed took \"ghost pho- tos\" and that he planned an \"ultimate prank\" has been attributed to one local teenager (NM) who has had a grudge against Ed and Ed's son ever since Ed barred him from coming to parties because the young man brought some of his friends who were known to be \"into drugs.\" (Ed has been very adamant that there be no liquor nor drugs at the parties at his house for local teenagers.) Apparently this young man also was quite angry that a cer- tain girl was a close friend of Ed's son. In late 1987 he began to write nasty, demeaning letters to Ed's son (I have seen some of these). He also \"keyed\" (scratched) the son's car and put sugar in the gas tank. He ended the harassment when Ed threatened to call the police. As H&S have pointed out, Don Ware and the local investigators have dismissed the \"ghost photo\" and \"ultimate prank\" as a \"false issue.\" However, according to H&S \"the objective facts suggest otherwise.\" What objective facts? H&S claim 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"that there are reports that Ed bragged about an \"ultimate prank.\" From whom do we have these reports? We have only the testimony of a teenager who, himself, is far from being above sus- picion. David Richardson of the Pen- sacola News Journal tried to check up on this NM's story by interviewing several of the teenagers that NM had claimed could support his story. However, Richardson learned nothing to support NM's claim that Ed was involved with an \"ultimate hoax.\" Don Schmitt of the Center for UFO Studies also called several of the children mentioned by NM. Schmitt was surprised to learn that they hadn't been to Ed's house for a long time (months) and that they had no knowledge of Ed being involved in a hoax. Finally, Don Ware's \"spy\" attended numerous parties at Ed's house and found no evidence of a UFO hoax (or any other type of hoax, which is why Ware rejected the Boyd-Smith hoax theory as a false issue.) The relevance of the suggestion that Ed might have intentionally taken double exposure photographs at par- ties that occurred about two years before his UFO photos is clear: if it could be proven that he knew how to take double exposure photos then this would provide support for the claim that the photos were hoaxed, although it would not proue they were hoaxed. Thus the important question raised by H&S (following Boyd and Smith in earlier private publications) is this: is rhere proof that Ed deliberately took double exposure photographs? When this was first brought up in the spring of 1988, Ed stated that he could recall only one photo, out of hundreds (?) that he may have taken of children who have come to his monthly parties (for teenagers), had an unexpected image. The unex- pected image appeared in the photo of a girl who was at a Halloween party in 1985. Ed was as puzzled as the children as to how the image came about but, in keeping with the occasion, suggested that the image was that of a ghost. This suggestion was evidently heard by several child- ren at the party. In the fall of 1988 a Miami TV sta- 16 tion decided to do an \"expose\" of the Gulf Breeze sightings. With the aid of the teenager who had accused Ed, the station managed to acquire two original photos of the girl. The two photos were taken, one after the other. The first photo shows the girl and some background features of the room. The second picture, which was taken from a slightly different loca- tion, shows the girl, the background features and some bright spots in a random array, the \"ghost.\" Until the original photos were ob- tained no investigator had actually seen the \"ghost\" photo. Ed, trying to recall the photo taken over two years before, remembered only an indistinct blob or blobs of light that made an indistinct \"image.\" He did not recall a clearly defined \"ghost\" shape. Yet Robert Boyd and Dr. Smith and the other investigators (myself included) had discussed it as if it showed a def- inite image of a \"ghost\" or a \"devil.\" Smith and Boyd had therefore argued that it could only have been pro- duced intentionally by a double exposure technique or some .trickery using mirrors (my emphasis).\" The story of this photo grew in the skep- tical retelling to the point that Ed was \"accused\" of deliberately taking numer- ous double exposure photos at parties. When I saw the actual photo (on TV) I had to laugh. It shows that Ed's recollection was correct. The \"ghost image\" is just a number of bright blobs of light in a random arrange- ment at the left of the image of the girl. There is no definite image. Robert Boyd tried to find a face- like image in the arrangement of bright spots and, in so doing, proved that he can pass a \"Rohrshach Test.\" He found that if you look carefully you can find two roundish spots that are side-by-side (the \"eyes\"?) and a larger roundish spot (the \"mouth,\" or is it a fat nose?). These spots form a tilted \"face.\" Of course, you have to ignore all the other \"non-facelike\" blobs of light. In Ed's recreation room there is a large mirror on a wall. Opposite that is a plate glass wall that separates the living room from the recreation room. One can easily imagine these glass surfaces catching the flash and bounc- ing it off other reflective surfaces that are within the field of view of the pic- ture thus creating unexpected images in the picture. An accidental combi- nation of reflections from the mirror or from the glass wall with reflections off reflective objects could easily create unexpected images. For example, Ed may have taken the picture while looking at an angle (not 90 degrees) toward the plate glass wall. The girl might have been on the same side of the glass as Ed or on the opposite side (in which case the picture would have been taken through the glass wall.) Under these conditions some reflective objects (pictures, drinking glasses, white shirts, wall lamps, etc.) on the same side of the glass wall as Ed, could have been illuminated by the flash either directly by the flash cube or indirectly by a reflection of the flash off the glass wall. At certain angles of the camera relative to the glass wall, light from these objects could return to the camera so that they would be photographed indi- rectly, by reflection off the glass wall. On the other hand, objects on the far side of the wall would be photo- graphed directly, as through a win- dow. If the objects photographed by reflection from the wall were much farther away from Ed (the \"optical distance\") than the girl, then, since the camera was well focused on her, their reflections would be unfocused, diffuse blobs. These reflections could create images that would be super- imposed on the images of objects on the opposite of the wall (the back- ground images). This general arran- gement as I have described (photo- graphing a person who stands next to the glass wall) has been tested by Ed at my request. He has demonstrated that it is difficult to avoid getting images of reflective objects on the same side of the wall as he stands because the flash is so bright. Thus it has been demonstrated that a \"ghost\" image similar to the one in the pic- ture of the girl could have been created accidentally in Ed's recrea- tion room. The collection of randomly placed blobs appears only in the second photo, which was taken from a slightly different location than the first. It seems quite possible to me that specular reflections of the camera MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Demon's Delight? Mrs. Ed with \"ghost\" image. flash, being highly direction depend- ent, could cause odd reflection spots in a picture taken from one location and not in a picture taken from a slightly different location. In order to demonstrate how the so-called \"ghost photographs\" were accidentally made by Ed, the follow- ing experiment was conducted. The first photo shows Bob Reid next to the \"ghost\" and the second photo illustrated shows \"Mrs. Ed\" next to a different \"ghost.\" These pictures were taken by the method described in this report. Both Bob and Frances were stand- ing next to the glass doorway between Ed's (former) living room and the recreation room. They were on the same side of the doorway as Ed when he took the picture. The \"ghost\" in each case is a reflection in the glass. The \"ghost\" in the picture with Bob consists of reflections of Bob's face and also some objects on a ladder. The \"ghost\" with Francis consists of jars and balloons. Ed mentioned that balloons were present at most par- ties. Bob Reid stood next to the door in such a way that the wall adjoining the door is visible. Francis stood in such a manner that none of the framework of the door was vis- ible. Unfortunately there is no furni- ture in Ed's old house to make images of things seen through the glass door as there are in the original \"ghost\" photo. The importance of the pictures, espe- cially the picture of Frances, is that they show how the original ghost MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 photos could have happened quite by accident if the girl had happened to be standing by the glass door when Ed took her picture. These pictures prove that the original \"ghost\" photo could have been an accident and did not have to be taken by double exposure as has been claimed. The reason for publishing both and not just Frances is that the photo with Bob Reid establishes that these were controlled tests, carried out at my request, and that Bob can verify that the \"ghosts\" were, indeed, produced by reflection in a glass. If the photo of Bob was not published, the skeptic's immediate response would be that Ed simply duplicated his double expo- sure technique to create a picture of Frances. The photo of Bob, however, with the edge of the glass door show- ing and the ghost in the glass proves how the photo was taken. The Boyd- Smith argument, as summarized by H&S, now looses its importance. H&S have used the testimony of Mayor Grey to bolster their case that \"Ed's reputation as a prankster is not without prior foundation.\" Mr. Grey is quoted as saying \"Ed's a heck of a nice guy, very charming, but it is totally consistent with his personality to pull off a stunt like this.\" The reader will remember that Grey went on record in late April as claiming that the sightings were a hoax because he was afraid that Gulf Breeze was getting a bad \"image\" (see the section entitled Premature Publicity). Mr. Grey may be an expert on the \"image\" of Gulf Breeze, but is he an expert on Ed's personality? Ed is well known for inventing creative games for teenag- ers (to give them something to do and keep them out of trouble). He was personally thanked by the Mayor for creating a citywide game to help celebrate an anniversary. But is this comparable to creating a UFO hoax which could have a considerable unfavorable impact on many people in Gulf Breeze? I think not. Further- more, neither Dr. Overlade nor Har- vey McLaughlin, who studied Ed in ways which could detect a malicious personality, found anything in Ed's character that would suggest he might attempt a UFO hoax. Mr. Grey's implied suggestion that there is little difference between Ed's creative games and a large scale UFO hoax reminds me of Philip Klass' suggested explanation of the Val Johnson, police-car-damage case of August 1979. In UFOs, the Public Deceived (Prometheus Books, Buf- falo, NY, 1983) Klass essentially tried to deceive the public by suggesting that Johnson hoaxed the sighting and damaged his police car to provide hard evidence of the event. As evi- dence that Johnson might have hoaxed the sighting Klass suggested that Johnson was a practical joker. He based this suggestion on the state- ment by another police officer that, as a joke, Johnson might hide your cup of coffee. Evidently \"Believer Phil\" Klass hoped that the average reader could not tell the difference \"scale\" between hiding a cup of cof- fee and damaging a police car. H&S have protested that the inves- tigators were lax in checking into Ed's claims and background. They complain specifically about the deci- sion of the local investigators to refrain from questioning the 8-10 \"teenagers whose names and phone numbers had been provided as wit- nesses to the allegations against Ed in support of the teenager who had been involved in disagreements with Ed's son.\" Don Ware has said that the local investigators decided not to call the children since to do so and ask specific questions about Ed would reveal his identity as \"Mr. Ed\" and Ware and the others had promised not to reveal his identity. Moreover, as I have already pointed out, Don 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Bob Reid and a second, duplicate \"ghost\" image. Ware had a \"spy\" who would have been privy to the same information as the other teenagers, having been at Ed's house many times. However, the \"oath of confidentiality\" did not pre- vent others from questioning the children. I have already discussed the results of the investigations by David Richardson and Don Schmitt who independently questioned several of the children. They learned nothing of significance. Summary And Conclusions In concluding their article H&S claim that skepticism about the Gulf Breeze episode is \"entirely justified until independent photoanalysis work is completed and reported, the sup- posedly supporting evidence system- atically analyzed and the central questions answered.\" They criticized me and several others (Ware and Hopkins in particular) because our minds \"appear to be made up.\" (Nat- urally they did not criticize Dr. Smith who made up his mind at least by last April, when he wrote a paper entitled \"Gulf Breeze, The End,\" and perhaps even as early as last March when, according to Robert Reid, he tried to pressure Reid into convincing the other local investigators that Ed's sightings were a hoax ... and this was only after being in Gulf Breeze for a few hours! Nor do they criticize Robert Boyd and Mark Rhodighier who, in April, published the CUFOS statement that the case was a hoax, ref. 10.) I cannot speak for Ware and Hop- 18 kins, but I have described how I made up my mind at the beginning of this paper. Although I was aware of all the \"negative evidence,\" I was more impressed by the positive evi- dence, in particular the videotape and the stereo photos. Only very strong direct evidence to the contrary would convince me that Ed knew how to fake the SRS camera photos. (Just because 7 was able to figure out how to defeat the SRS camera after the March 17 and 20 photos were taken does not mean that Ed had figured it out before they were taken.) It is quite probable that a professional illu- sionist with plenty of support from associates could have hoaxed some- thing like Ed's sighting reports and photos if it had occurred to him to do so. But this statement regarding the capabilities of a professional illu- sionist is merely an observation with no relevance to the sightings since there is no evidence that a profes- sional illusionist was involved. If Ed were the only person to have reported sightings, i.e., if his family members had not reported seeing the UFO and if there were no other sightings by ~the Gulf Breeze resi- dents, I would still be very skeptical. However, I accept the idea that other people in Gulf Breeze have had sight- ings. I was, of course, aware of this fact during the spring and it played no small role in convincing me that Ed's sightings were real. As I said in ref. 2, \"It would, indeed, be strange if Ed's photos and sightings were writ- ten off as hoaxes while other sight- ings were accepted as true!\" At the beginning of this article I stated that I agree with general criti- cism ftl (premature publicity), #2 (insufficient publication) and #4 (un- even reporting of \"positive\" and \"nega- tive\" evidence) made by H&S. I also stated that I disagree with point #3 (there is \"negative evidence\"). It is my opinion that there never was convincing \"negative evidence\" of the sort that was publicized by Smith and Boyd. (Note that Ed's photos them- selves would not be considered \"neg- ative evidence\" unless one could find strong evidence within the photos themselves that trick methods must have been used. I could find no such conclusive proof.) The only potentially important \"nega- tive evidence\" was based on unrelia- ble testimony which was exaggerated by Boyd and Smith into a de-facto indictment of Ed's character. Specifi- cally, they used a claim by a teenager that Ed had taken numerous \"ghost photos\" at parties for children to suggest that the \"ghost images\" were made by double exposures or by other means for trick photography. To them this indicated that, at the very least, Ed knew something about trick photography. Even before they had the \"proof in hand, i.e., even before they had a \"ghost photo\" to prove Ed's knowledge of trick photography, they proclaimed the UFO photos to be hoaxes. However, now that (the) one \"ghost\" photo is available, they no longer have proof that Ed knew about trick photography. The \"nega- tive evidence\" has evaporated. There would be important negative evidence if credible witnesses testified that they had seen Ed (and his family) involved in creating UFO pictures. Such testimony of direct observafion of hoaxing would be very conclusive, as opposed to the evidence that H&S have cited which is, at best, indirect. Considering the number of photos that Ed took, the number of different UFOs represented, the number of locations at which he took photos and the videotape one would think that, if a hoax were being perpe- trated, someone would have seen something related to the hoax.

They complained loudly that the questions they raised were not being treated \"fairly\" by the local investigators. They were so certain that they were correct that they were willing to publicize their claims with a consequent negative impact on the Gulf Breeze witnesses. I have no problem with their skepticism of last spring, and I have no problem with the fact that they publicized it. What bothers me is that they have been unreasonable in continuing their adam- ant skepticism beyond the reasonable time for it to end, i.e., beyond last summer when Ed completed many hours of personality tests and hyp- notic regressions. These tests and regressions show that Ed is, without a doubt, a classic abductee. This explains why he is \"different\" from other people who have reported one or two sightings. By the end of the summer of 1988 the small community of researchers who worked directly on the case knew of Ed's regressions and his abduction reports (although the con- tent of these reports has been kept secret to avoid contamination of other cases; note that a number of items Ed has reported during regres- sions have turned up in other unpub- lished abduction accounts). At that point the skeptics within the UFO community should have admitted that, at the very least, they had little evi- dence to support their position. I hope that this article has ans- wered the questions raised by H&S. I hope the reader will now understand why I arrived at that conclusion and I hope that the arguments presented here will help the reader make a more informed decision of his own as to whether or not he accepts this case. As for myself, I agree with Jim Moseley that, until some universally convincing proof of fraud is unco- vered, \"Ed deserves benefit of the doubt.\" References 1) Hall, R. and Willy Smith, \"Balanc- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 ing the Scale,\" MUFON UFO Jour- nal, #248, December 1988. 2) Maccabee, Bruce, \"A History of the Gulf Breeze, Florida Sightings (revised), Analysis of Stereo Photos taken on February 26 and May 1 and Viewgraphs presented During the MUFON International Symposium Pro- ceedings;\" the first listed paper was first published in the Proceedings of the International MUFON UFO Sym- posium, June 1988; the revised ver- sion of that paper and the other two papers listed here are available from the Fund for UFO Research, Box 277, Mt.

APPENDIX 1 Computer Analyzed Photos Two of these photos have been studied to determine if there is evi- dence of hoaxing. These are ttl and #5. Photo #1 (see Figure 1) shows the UFO apparently behind the tree. If this photo were a superposition by double exposure the very dark image of the tree branch would be over- layed by the brighter image of the main body of the craft. Photo 5 (see Figure 3) has a line running from the top of the picture to the bottom. It has been suggested that this line is a suspending device for a model. This suggestion raises the question of whether or not this line crosses over the image of the UFO and therefore could be a film flaw. To study the possibility of a double exposure, photo ttl was \"tricolor scanned\" (red, blue, and green color separation filters were used) with an Optronics image digitizer operated in the reflection mode. The scanning was done with 255 grey levels (plus zero) and at 100 micron resolution. The data tape was sent to Dr. Mark Carlatto of The Analytical Sciences Corp (Boston). He used image pro- cessing equipment to produce Figure 2. Figure 2 is a reconstruction of a portion of the \"blue image\" (the dig- itized image obtained when the blue color filter was used) of photo 1. (Blue was used to reconstruct the image since the picture has an overall bluish cast, a property of the Polaroid Type 108 film when used at low light levels.) It is a blowup of the UFO image and the adjoining tree image. In this enhanced picture it is clear that the tree overlaps the main body of the UFO image because the tree image is \"perfectly black\" even where it cuts into main body of the image. The tree image does not overlap image of the bright bottom because the UFO was tilted. For comparison with the results of the computer-aided analysis, note that Figure 1 is a high contrast copy of photo 1 that was made for Robert Nathan at JPL. This high contrast copy also shows that the tree image 20 completely blocked the image of the left side of the main body of the UFO. The area within the small box drawn on the picture in Figure 2 was analyzed further to try to determine whether or not the UFO could have been a photo of a model which was cutout and pasted onto a photo of the background and the combination rephotographed. However this analy- sis was inconclusive because the images in photo 1 were clearly smear- ed a small amount by camera motion as proven by the elongation of the images of both the UFO top light and the streetlight at the right side of the full frame photo (see Figure 1; these images are smeared in a downward- to-the-right direction). Figure 3 is a high contrast copy of Photo 5 that was made at JPL. Barely visible, running from the top of the picture to the bottom and ouer the,UFO image just to the left of the third \"window\" from the left, is a faint white line. The line is quite, though not perfectly, straight on the average, but on close inspection is seen to have small wiggles in it. Figure 4 is a high contrast digitized blowup of the UFO image and the surrounding area. Ignore the bright spots and blotches which are film defects, dust, etc. which were picked up and amplified by the digitizing-enhancing process. Clearly evident, just to the left of the center of the UFO image is the wiggly line that runs from the top of the picture to the bottom. The line clearly passes \"over\" or through the image of the UFO. Thus this is a film flaw. This type of flaw has been seen in a number of the Type 108 Polaroid pictures, including non-UFO pictures, as pointed out in reference 2.

Haines, Ph.D. . Dr. Haines is the author of Observing UFOS (1980) and Mel- bourne Incident: Case Study of a Missing Pilot (1987). Abstract A simple technique is proposed for permitting UFO witnesses to recog- nize digitally produced reproductions of the sounds that were heard during a UFO encounter. Using a modern digitally controlled electronic keyboard (also called \"music synthesizer,\" \"dig- ital tone generator,\" etc.), a trained field investigator can plan, develop, and present a wide variety of sounds, find one or two that matches what was heard originally, and then record the settings to permit later character- ization of the frequencies and even comparison with recollections of other witnesses. Considering the very large number of different sounds possible, if two (or more witnesses) choose the same sound characteristic(s) inde- pendently while using the present UFOSRT, there is stronger reason to believe both actually heard the sound selected rather than selecting it merely on the basis of chance. The present UFOSRT might also be helpful in developing insights concerning the nature of the phenomenon itself. Introduction The general subject of sounds associated with UFO sightings has been treated elsewhere and will not be reviewed here in depth (Gillmor, 1968; Hall, 1964; McCampbell, 1973; Vallee, 1969). It is unfortunate that Hall\"s (1964, pg. 98) statement still is true that \"To date, the descriptions of the sounds have been sketchy.\" This line of questioning has not been pursued by investigators in as much detail as it might have been, probably because of the \"silent UFO stero- type.\" Hopefully the present paper will not only encourage investigators MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 to take more notice of any such sounds but also provide a potentially powerful method for doing so. A rather wide range of sounds have been experienced before, dur- ing, and/or after sighting aerial phen- omena. McCampbell (1973, pg. 43) has categorized these sounds into five basic groups (violent; low pitch; rush of air; high pitch; signals). Des- pite the differences one would expect between the subjective descriptions given by different witnesses and chang- es that occur over time there is a remarkable commonality of terms, so much so that one would expect that auditory memory should be able to \"recognize\" the basic features of the sound. The author has developed a simi- lar lar approach to visual recognition memory for UFO outline shapes (Haines, 1970). Indeed, the present UFOSRT represents a continuing attempt to help upgrade the quality of' UFO evidence. Method/Apparatus Even though the normal human auditory perception range is from 20 to 20,000 Hz (Guyton, 1961), a sound generator used for present purposes need not necessarily be able to pres- ent this wide a range of frequencies. What is far more important is the ability to generate a rich variety of complex tones with harmonic com- ponents, timbers, reverberation, onset and offset features, intensities, special effects, etc. The human auditory system's abil- ity to perceive whether or not a given tone is present depends, among other things, on its intensity. Thus, for a sound intensity as low as -60 db a frequency range only from 500 to 5,000 Hz can be detected. When intensity is increased to -20 db, the frequency range expands to from about 70 to 15,000 Hz (Ibid.). The point is that a witness can only rec- ognize sounds that were heard; a sound generator must be capable of controlling both frequency and inten- sity. And in old age, one typically can only detect frequencies from 50 to 8,000 Hz or less (Hirsh, 1952). There- fore, the sound generating device that is capable of being used for young people with good hearing will be use- ful with the elderly. A large number of electronic key- boards are now available in an almost equally wide price range. Even the less expensive models can produce most of the sound characteristics dis- cussed above. In addition, there are other features which should be sought for this application. Table 1 lists these features. Sound Generation and Other Characteristics of Value to UFO Field Studies Wide frequency range (from 10 Hz to 25 KHz) High Dynamic Sound Pressure Playback/record capability Registration Memory capability (to repeat tone sequences) Orchestra settings: (organ, strings, brass, clarinet, calliope, piano, harpsichord, vibes, guitar, bass) Solo settings: (flute, piccolo, violin, trumpet, horn, trombone, saxophone, oboe) Percussion settings: (snare drum, bass drum, cymbol) Special effects: (hiss, steam, hand clap, bells, chimes, others) Table 1 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The witness should stand exactly where he or she stood at the time of the original event, facing the same direction. The field investigator should be located at a position that approximates the UFO's location. The witness should close his or her eyes and recall the original event in as much detail as possible. Procedure The basic technique which should be followed in performing a sound recognition test involves a visit by the witness and investigator to the origi- nal site if possible. The importance of returning to the original site cannot be overemphasized. Not only will the sights and sounds present there tend to stimulate more accurate recall for original memories but the acoustical characteristics of the environment will also be the same (or similar) as they were originally; such sound reflection- absorption-scattering characteristics can play a vitally important role in sound formation. The witness should stand exactly where he or she stood at the time of the original event, facing the same direction. The field investigator (with the equipment) should be located at a position that approximates the UFO's location (but not distance). The wit- ness should close his or her eyes and recall the original event in as much detail as possible. The investigator already should have pre-selected a sub-set of sounds in advance (based upon the verbal interview). If a large number of candidate sounds are to be played to the witness, then it is important that playing one does not unduly influence his perception of the next. Each sound should be played to the witness for from five-ten seconds at the most with about a 20 second silent period (or longer) between them. It is wise to not concentrate upon one particular sound character- istic with the witness until a complete combination is found that contains as many different features of the original sound as possible. Once the sound is found which comes closest to the original UFO's sound only then should 26 its intensity be concentrated on. For example, did the sound stop suddenly or fade away as the UFO departed? If a tonal shift was remembered (similar to the doppler shift effect), this too can be generated at this time. Finally, temporally recurring patterns of on â off â on â off can be duplicated. This trial and error process may take minutes or hours. When completed the field investigator should digitally record the sound(s) or at least the exact keyboard and other settings of the sound generating device for later analysis. It also is a good idea to tape record the entire process above for later replay in case the witness changes his or her mind and feels an earlier sound was correct. These tape record- ings are also useful in understanding the sound characteristics components that contributed to the original sound that was heard. Discussion This paper has outlined an effective and convenient means for generating a wide variety of repeatable sounds to a UFO witness in order to identify one which matches that heard during the original event. The overall accu- racy of such a method based upon recognition (auditory memory) will be greater than if an original \"sound generation\" technique is used, the major objective of the present UFOSRT approach is to obtain repeatable measures of UFO-related sounds under conditions as close to the original conditions as possible.

Moore, a graduate mechanical engineer, aero- logist, and balloonist, and four Navy enlisted men, observed a rapidly mov- ing UFO at 10:20 a.m. near White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico. \"It didn't appear to be large,\" one of the scientists said, \"but it was plainly visible. It was easy to see that it was elliptical in shape and had a whitish- silver color.\" After taking a split second to realize what they were looking at, one of the men swung a theodolite around to pick up the object and the timer reset his stop watch. For sixty seconds they tracked the UFO as it moved toward the east. In about 55 seconds it had dropped from an angle of elevation of 45 degrees to 25 degrees, then it zoomed upward and in a few seconds it was out of sight. They estimated the size of the UFO to be 40 feet wide and 100 feet long and at an alti- tude of 56 miles. It was traveling about 25,200 miles per hour. *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - April 1954: Elbert E. Edwards, super- intendent of schools in Boulder, Colo- rado, his teenage son, Arthur, and the internationally known explorer, John Goddard, sighted an enormous, cigar-shaped object, brilliantly lighted by five or six large porthole-like open- ings, while camping in the Grand Canyon in Arizona on the 16th. The UFO passed from north to southwest at 10:20 p.m. at an altitude estimated at 6,000 feet above the canyon rim. Edwards said the object was between 300 and 400 feet in length. Two other witnesses camped in the same area reported seeing a \"flying monster with many lights\" the same night. On the 23rd, a Pan American air- liner, piloted by Captain Jack Adriance, was flying at 20,000 feet between Puerto Rico and New York. Suddenly MUFON UFO Journal, No. 252, April 1989 a call came from another Pan Ameri- can plane more than 200 miles behind. A strange flying object, the other captain reported, had just streak- ed past. \"It's headed straight toward you,\" said the pilot. It's round and pulsating with an orange-greenish light.\" A few moments later Captain Adriance was amazed to see the object, or an identical one, flash past his airliner. Cutting in his microphone, he called Captain Ned Mullen, piloting another Pan American flight ahead. In a few minutes Mullen radioed back that the mysterious UFO had just passed him, disappearing in seconds. *** THIRTY YEARS AGO â April 1959: About 8:30 p.m., Mr. and Mrs. Bill Loomis were driving near Tenino, Washington, 30 miles southwest of McChord Air Force Base, when they spotted a brilliant UFO to the east moving north at a high rate of speed. \"It really traveled at a high rate of speed,\" Loomis said, \"and I mean it was fast. It was just over the tree tops.\" The object appeared to be moving down the valley east of McChord. About the same time the pilot of an Air Force C-118 transport, on a routine training flight out of McChord, radioed that \"We have hit something, or something has hit us.\" The message was followed by the crash of the C-118 five miles sou- theast of the city of Sumner. The four man crew was killed. Following the crash, Col. Robert E. Booth, commander of the 1705th Air Trans- port Group to which the plane was attached, made the following state- ment: \"It would appear there was a kind of mid-air collision prior to the crash.\" Confirming Booth's statement, Bill Loomis said the UFO appeared to have been traveling in the direction where the big transport was crippled in mid-air. *** TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO - April 1964: Mr. and Mrs. Allen Lund, who live near Missoula, Mon- tana, said a \"ship definitely not of this world\" visited their ranch several times in April. They described the object as a large \"top-shaped ship with a row of lights around its cir- cumference.\" A strong beam of light projected from the shape late one night as Mrs. Lund and her daughter, Mrs. Connie Savage, slept in the front of the house. They both awa- kened to see the beam of light, about three inches in diameter, pointing at their feet at the end of the bed. They both rose and, according to Mrs. Lund, the beam followed them around the room. She reported each appear- ance of the craft \"scared the dogs and spooked the horses.\" The dogs rushed to get into the house and horses stampeded to the far side of the property. In addition to the strange reaction of the animals, each time the ship was in the area the oil furnace in the house would \"light itself.\" Mrs. Sav- age's son, 3^-year-old Kyle, told his mother and grandparents of a man with whom he talks in the barn. He told them the man's name, but Mrs. Lund said it's almost unpronouncea- ble. The child \"disappeared for sev- eral hours at a time and then sud- denly shows up from nowhere,\" Mrs. Lund said. He claims he has been talking with the man but won't take her to him because, \"We don't want you â and that man doesn't like you.\" Mrs. Lund is convinced the ship is \"not of this world,\" thinks the occupants of the ship are probably friendly and \"we have nothing to be frightened of.\" Gary Wilcox, well known and sub- stantial farmer near Newark Valley, New York, said he carried on a con- versation with two persons from another planet after their spaceship landed on his farm on the 24th. He said he discovered the ship about 10:30 a.m. When he reached the object, which was on landing gear about four feet above the ground, two beings came out from under the craft. They were dressed from head to foot in uniforms the same alumi- num color as their ship. The two occupants immediately engaged him 27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"in conversation. \"They spoke as good English as I do,\" Wilcox said. He said the conversation was pretty one- sided, with the visitors doing most of the talking. Wilcox said they made no effort to attack him or harm him but seemed greatly interested in the soil, grass, shrubs, twigs and dirt, and gathered up several samples. He des- cribed the ship as being about 20 feet high, 16 feet wide, and between 4 and 5 feet thick. Wilcox said the vehicle took off at 12:30 p.m., \"so fast I could hardly see it.\" Shortly before 6 p.m. of the same day, Officer Lonnie Zamora spotted a four-legged, egg-shaped craft in a gully a mile south of the courthouse in Socorro, New Mexico. He first saw it from about 200 yards and thought it was an overturned car. He said he saw what appeared to be a pair of white coveralls, but whether anything was in them he did not know. He eventually got to within about 100 feet before he noticed it was some- thing out of the ordinary. The craft, about the height of a car but larger, appeared to be made of shiny, aluminum- like metal. When he got to within 50 feet of the craft the vehicle ascended and slowly moved away until it faded from sight. Zamora said the craft was on the ground, supported by four girder-like legs. At the site, four five- to-six inch depressions were found as well as a couple of round tracks about four inches in diameter which officers theorized might have been made by occupants of the vehicle. They even went so far as to estimate by the depression that the tracks were made by a being of approxi- mately 120-160 pounds. About 12:30 a.m. on the 26th, Orlando Gallegos sighted a large UFO sitting on the ground near La Madera, New Mexico. He said he was about 200 feet away and was afraid to approach closer. He des- cribed the craft as being of bright metal without windows, as long as a utility pole, about 14 feet in circum- ference and resembling a large butane tank. The following day Capt. Martin Vigil, state police district commander, and officer David Kingsbury, went to the landing site. \"The ground was still smoldering 20 hours after the sight- ing,\" Vigil said. \"It was charred over a 28 large area.\" He added that what looked like paw prints were found at the scene, along with depressions similar to those found at Socorro. The charred area was a pecular shape, like two overlapping circles, about 20 feet across. Large rocks within the area showed evidence of extreme heat, while others within a few feet weren't damaged at all. A soft drink bottle had melted while another five feet away was intact. Capt. Vigil said evidence indicates an extreme heat of short duration rather than a smoldering fire over a period of days. He said it is his belief that \"something was there.\" While driving about 30 miles east of Albuquerque, New Mexico, on the 28th, Don Adams fired twelve .22- calibre pistol shots at an \"oblong thing\" at about 1 a.m. He said he hit the craft six times and heard the bullets bounce from it after his car stalled while driving under the vehi- cle. As he paused to reload, the craft moved silently northward. He was unable to determine whether shots 7 to 12 struck the object. He described it as being a light green color, about 25 or 30 feet long and silent. He said it hovered about 100 feet directly over his head. Later the same day, Sharon Stull, 10, of Albuquerque, New Mexico, observed a UFO for five or 10 minutes. Thirty minutes later, while in class, she noticed burn- ing sensations about the eyes and face. Sharon's doctor said \"The sun exposure she had would usually be considered insufficient to cause the burns and inflammation. It appears to be the type caused by longer expo- sure to the sun.\" *** TWENTY YEARS AGO - April 1969: It was 2 a.m. on the 23rd when Mrs. Virginia A. Guinn and a boarder were awakened by violent reactions from dogs and cats at her farm in Silver Springs, Maryland. Most of the dogs were \"barking and howling,\" but the boarder's German Shepherd \"was barking in a peculiar manner â a ser- ies of short barks.\" Outside, Mrs. Guinn's four cats were climbing up the screen door, yowling and fighting, \"something they had never done before.\" Going outside, the witnesses saw a round, bluish white craft \"as large as two rooms.\" Then the observers heard a humming noise and the craft suddenly vanished. When the craft disappeared the animals quieted down. Mrs. Guinn discovered later that morning that the horses in the barn \"had broken free of their tie stalls, and had knocked harnesses, etc., off the walls.\" She also said that a neighbor's barn had been \"torn up\" by horses during the sighting. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - April 1974: Newton Grove, North Carolina police officer John Hayes said he was notified by radio (date unknown) that a UFO was headed toward that Sampson County town, around mid- night. Shortly afterward a circular craft hovered above his police car. He turned on the patrol car spotlight and the craft produced a light in response. He said the UFO \"ans- wered his flashes\" for a period of time before moving away. The same month (date unknown), Duplin County, North Carolina school bus driver Gail Stroud said a bright orange UFO dove at her school bus, terrifying her and the children. She said it then backed off and flew in front of her bus for approximately two miles. She said each time she would stop the bus and turn on the flashing red stop lights, the object would also turn on red lights. It finally sped away at high speed after turning in the sky, reveal- ing a frying-pan shape. MUFON AMATEUR RADIO NET EVERY SATURDAY MORNING AT 0800 EST (OR DST) ON7237KHzs.s.B.

Beam Zaps Earth \"The Earth is being zapped by a beam from outer space and scientists tell us they don't know what it is. The beam comes from a star system far, far away â 14,000 light years away. The beam is aimed directly at us and what is spooky about it is that scientists don't know what it is, but they say it carries a million billion electron volts of energy. For two years scientists have been gathering data. The beam comes from what scientists call a neutron star. It is nearly the size of our own moon but this star is extremely dense, and has a mass nearly double that of the sun. The star is described as a large spinning magnet, generates electro- magnetic fields and gives off powerful radiation. \"It was first detected by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in July of 1986. Scientists say the finding is both interesting and puzzling. It could mean the presence of a hew kind of particle. The discovery could give us new insights about sources of energy in the universe and about the elemen- try structure of matter. Therefore it could be extremely relevant to our understanding of the universe, but so far scientists know very little about this mysterious beam. Scientists have been checking and rechecking their research and trying to come up with explanations. But so far conventional theories just don't explain it. \"Now, some people, when they encounter the unexplainable, try to forget about it or brush it off as a bad dream. But scientists have been try- ing to make this unexplainable thing go away, trying to prove that the beam doesn't really exist, trying to say in some cases that it's a mistake. But so far they have not been able to prove that, because it's there. The beam will not go away. Nobody knows what it is, and yet it could have a major impact on our society one day. Who knows, it could change our lives. We can only guess right now. We're like little children staring up at the sky and wondering. We think we know so much and yet the more we know the more we find how little we know. Emerson put it this way: \"We think our civilization is near its meridian but we are yet only at the cock crowing and the morning star.\" â Charles Osgood \"The Osgood File\" CBS Radio (Submitted by Bob Gribble) MUFON AWARD BALLOT A ballot will be enclosed in the May 1989 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal so all members and subscribers may vote for their choice to receive the Annual MUFON Award plaque for the most outstanding contribution to ufology for 1988-1989. 29"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"NEWS FLASH Donald B. Ratsch, MUFON member in Baltimore, Maryland, has been monitoring the radio broadcasts from the space shut- tle Discovery through WA3NAN, the club station of the Goddard Amateur Radio Club in Green- belt, MD, transmitting on 147.450 MHZ. At 6:35 a.m. EST on March 14, 1989, he heard this statement, \"we have a problem â we have a fire.\" (This might have been the first clue to the. resultant electrical problem that was subsequently repaired.) The most interesting trans- mission occurred seven minutes later at 6:42 a.m. EST, when one of the astronauts made this statement \"Houston (from) Dis- covery, we still have the alien spacecraft under observance.\" Don Ratsch called Walt Andrus and played the tape recording over the telephone on the morn- ing of March 14, 1989. Further analysis of the tape is now being conducted by qualified person- nel in Maryland as of Sunday, March 19th. Preliminary analysis of the voice by comparison methods indicates that the astro- naut making the second trans- mission was probably either Mich- ael L. Coats, Commander of Discovery or John E. Blaha, the pilot. We hope to provide more details in the May issue of the Journal on this exciting event. MUFON 20th ANNIVERSARY May 31, 1989 The Night Sky By Walter N. Webb April 1989 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars continues to separate from Jupiter in Taurus, the pair being about 16Â° apart in mid-April. Mars is to the upper left of the more bril- liant giant (25 times brighter) which dominates the western sky at dusk. In midmonth Jupiter (-2.0 magnitude) sets just before 11 PM daylight time; Mars (1.5), about an hour later. The crescent Moon passes the two planets on April 9 and 10. Toward the end of the month, look for an orange dot about 10Â° to the lower right of Jupiter. It is Mercury at its best appearance of the year. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Saturn (0.4 magnitude), in Sagittarius, rises about 1:30 AM daylight time and is positioned low in the SSE at dawn in mid-April. The ringed planet begins retrograding (moving westward) on the 22nd. Meteor Shower: The bright gibbous Moon hampers the April 22 peak of the annual Lyrid meteors. Ordinarily about 15 of the bright white streaks would have been visible toward dawn darting out of the constellation Lyra the Harp. The shower actually lasts from about the 19th to the 24th but in smaller numbers. Moon Phases: New moon â April 5 First quarter â April 12 Full moon â April 20 Last quarter â April 28 o 30 The Stars: That celestial symbol of spring, Leo the Lion, is due south at 10 PM day- light time. Look for a backward question mark of six stars, with Regulus marking the dot. This sickle-shaped pattern represents the lion's head and mane. A triangle of stars to the left is the beast's rear haunches and tail. The Big Dipper once again lies high in the north in its best evening posi- tion of the year. Use its various pointer stars to find other springtime star patterns. Besides the two stars on the end of the bowl pointing the way to Polaris the North Star, the curve of the dipper's handle \"arcs to Arcturus and spikes to Spica.\" Arcturus is the bright orange star in Bootes the Herdsman, while Spica is the brightest luminary in Virgo the Maiden. Reversing the bowl pointers brings you back to Leo. This month the Moon covers (occults) two groups of stars for observers in the Northeastern States. On the evening of the 8th, some of the Plei- ades will be hidden by the lunar crescent. Nearby Jupiter enhances the show. On April 13 the quarter Moon crosses the Beehive in Cancer, the little star cluster introduced in the March \"Night Sky.\" MUFON UFO Journal, No. 242, April 1989"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, continued available starting Thursday, June 29 and extending through July 3 for people arriving early or departing after the symposium at the same pri- ces.
