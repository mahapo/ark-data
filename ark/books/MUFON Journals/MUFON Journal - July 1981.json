FROM THE EDITOR The Boston MUFON Symposium is now history (a major event), and the next large conference is that of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) in Chicago, September 25-27. It has been an extraordinary year for UFO meetings in the U.S., and a healthy sign that serious researchers are actively seeking better organization, new approaches, and improved information-sharing. In that spirit, we propose mutual cooperation among all UFO groups and private investigators to form cross-group Documenta- tion Teams (see article this issue) to concentrate on compiling thoroughly documented case books of significant case types. Persons with training or experience in the disciplines relevant to each of these case types are requested to work together to assure thorough investigation and full documentation of significant cases in each category. The resulting compilations would be a challenge to science and national opinion-makers.

WHAT ARE UFOs? We don't know. Some of the things reported as \"UFOs\" are balloons, planets, meteors, satellites, stars, adver- tising aircraft, and the like. The \"hard\" sightings are yet to be explained: daylight discs, objects with lighted \"portholes,\" objects simultaneously tracked visually and on radar at fantastic speeds, objects which leave phy- sical evidence after landing. These \"hard\" cases cannot currently be explained by anything we now know. It is in this category of sightings that the serious UFO researcher is attempting to gather additional evidence. The JOURNAL has access to and publishes UFO sighting reports from all over the world as investigated and reported by MUFON's international liaison representatives. It has a staff of reporters and columnists second to none in the UFO publishing field. Guest writers include members of MUFON's Advisory Board of Consul- tants, most of whom possess doctorates in their respective fields of expertise. The JOURNAL is our most significant means of sharing details of UFO sighting reports and vital information related to the UFO phenomenon with our members and readers throughout, the world. THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL (Successor to SKYLOOK founded in 1967) has established itself as one of the leading monthly UFO magazines in the world today. A subscription to the JOURNAL is included in the annual MUFON mem- bership dues of $15.00 for adults in the U.S.A, $16.00 foreign, (U.S. funds) and $12.00 for students under 18 years of age. There are people vitally interested in the UFO enigma, but for various reasons prefer not to be actively involved in UFO sighting investigations or research. They may elect to join MUFON as a \"Contribut- ing Subscriber\" at the regular membership rate of $15.00 U.S.A. and $16.00 foreign. A sample copy may be obtained for $1.50.

Sponsored by the Tarheel UFO Study Group, the event received a large amount of news media attention. Ray Rhein served as Master of Ceremonies. After opening remarks by Jayne Ware, President of TUSG, and Henry Morton, N.C. MUFON State Direc- tor, Allan Hendry was scheduled as the first speaker. Since he was ill and unable to attend, Mr. Morton dem- onstrated the microcomputer tapes that Mr. Hendry had developed. They included a UFOMAP of North Carolina and parts of surrounding states, containing strategic plots (military bases, technical facilities) and identification of investigators across the state; a MICROCAT cata- logue of local UFO sightings; and IFO guides. Also available is a video- tape that allows plotting of astro- nomical objects for the time and date of a UFO sighting (see notice else- where with this article). Ray Rhein, M.C. Dr. Willy Smith, a physicist from Norcross, Georgia, and consultant to the Center for UFO Studies, de- scribed and showed photographs and sketches of an unusual aerial phenomenon seen over Argentina Gayle McBride and her humanoid head sculpture and Brazil on June 14, 1980. The suspicion that the phenomenon had been caused by a NASA experiment called \"Project Firefly\" originally scheduled for mid-June was incor- rect, he said, because the experiment was cancelled. Paul Norman, visiting from Victoria, Australia, gave an update on the Frederick Valentich case, in which the young pilot disappeared on October 21,1978 over Bass Strait after radioing that a UFO was hover- ing and maneuvering near his plane. The Australian government has re- fused to release the tape of his con- versation. Witnesses have been located to establish that Valentich had turned off the coast on the correct course; 15 witnesses have been found who saw an unexplain- ed green light over the strait at the time of the encounter. A photograph of an object seen emerging from the water 20 minutes before the en- counter is undergoing analysis. An analysis of UFO propulsion was presented by Henry Morton, stressing diamagnetism (a force \"op- posite\" to magnetism) as \"one possible answer.\" He sketched a UFO design that might allow use of diamagnetism for propulsion, and which would emit microwaves and other electromagnetic radiation as has been reported with UFOs. The features of the hypothetical craft also were applied to other commonly re- ported effects from UFOs, includ- ing light patterns and an ozone smell. Wayne La Porte presented an up- date of his fault zone theory and sightings, previously reported in the Journal. Speakers on Saturday evening and Sunday included the following: Richard Hall on \"UFO Docu- mentation\" (see separate summary). George Fawcett, pioneer UFO investigator in North Carolina, gave an overview of the UFO field after 30 years and reviewed case histories and photographs. Bernard Haugen, a chemist from Oxford, N.C., analyzed reports of UFOs that indicated them to be aircraft-like objects in certain re- spects, including some that appear- ed to have some form of rocket (Continued on next page) 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(N.C. Conference, Cont.) propulsion. He made the important point that a one-dimensional view of a UFO can be misleading, citing cases in which objects appeared to be round and flat but displayed a different form after being seen closer or at different angles. Rupert Von Fox, a chiropractor from Clemmons, N.C., gave a per-, sonal report on a sighting of a Saturn- shaped UFO during the summer of 1950 in the Ohio coal fields. Sam Jacobson, a hypnotist and teacher of self-actualization at Wake Forest University, spoke on . the nature of reality and a philosophical view of man. Libby Cocchiarella also discuss- ed our concepts of reality and the role of science, raising the question of whether our physical models ac- curately describe the universe. The final speaker was Tom Deuley, a Navy engineer with train- ing in atomic weaponry, and Secre- tary of the Fund for UFO Research. After a report on grants and other Fund projects to date, he spoke on radiation and UFOs. He stressed that there is no reason to link UFOs with radiation nor to assume that they use atomic propulsion. Radia- tion found at UFO sites could come from a number of sources and does not prove an outer space connection. If UFOs do emit radiation as some component it could be in several forms. He explained how to investi- gate suspected radiation at a UFO landing site to determine its form and possibly also its nature. Since the talk included important back- ground information for investigators, it will be printed in a future issue of the Journal. \"Amateur Astronomy Handbook,\" a video program for home computers that can be used to display star, planet, and moon positions for the date and time of a UFO sighting, is available from The Software Exchange, 6 South St., Milford, N.H. 03055 for $14.95 plus $2.50 post- age and handling. UFO DOCUMENTATION By Richard Hall (Summary of talk presented May 21, . 1981 at Fifth Annual MUFON of North Carolina Conference.) UFO documentation is very fundamental to what we do as uro- logists, from accurately identifying newspaper clippings to carefully recording all aspects of a UFO case investigation. Without a carefully documented body of facts, there is no point in trying to theorize about UFOs. If we ever expect to have UFOs taken seriously by scientists and other important people, we must progress beyond the point of compiling interesting anecdotes to the compilation of thoroughly in- vestigated and documented case re- ports that will command attention. I personally heard a radio news report about a crashed saucer and occupants, one said to be still alive, about 1952 while working in a gen- eral store. Being young and naive in those days, I made little effort to document the story beyond listen- ing for additional news (which, of course, never came). I could have and should have called the radio station, talked with radio wire ser- â€¢ vice persons, checked newspapers in a library, etc. Since I didn't, the .\"story remains only an interesting anecdote rather than a documented report. The Roswell Incident book about a 1947 crashed saucer case also pro- vides an example of poor document- ation. Though the central story about odd material that fell from the sky following an explosion does appear to be well documented, the rest of the story does not. The book is padded with undocumented, al- leged astronaut UFO sightings many or most of which have acceptable conventional explanations. The book also includes unidentified 1947 newspaper clippings so that efforts to authenticate them would be very difficult. Len Stringfield's investigations of crashed saucer/retrieval reports provides another example of a spe- cial problem of documentation. Hav- ing cooperated with him on a num- ber of investigations and having seen some of his private documen- tation, I am more aware than most people that he is clearly dealing with respectable first-hand witnesses or claimants...first-hand to him and hearsay to everyone else. His pro- blem is that he was only able to obtain the information in the first place by promising anonymity to his sources and he would be violating confidences to release all the in- formation he has. His hands are tied as far as public documentation; pri- vately, 1 affirm that the reports are real,'from responsible people, and apparently not part of some elabo- rate hoax since they have trickled out slowly over the years and often obtained only by painstaking detec- tive work. The accusations made about Len Stringfield by disgruntled Ohio \"ufologists\" are misguided and irresponsible. The CIA documents released under Freedom of Information Act requests represent still another facet of trying to document UFO history. I have read and studied the 892 pages and find clear internal evidence to show that the CIA is stonewalling in its failure to release its UFO case files. Where are the radar/visual/pi- lot cases that led the CIA in 1952 to propose to the National Security Council a major scientific investiga- tion of UFOs? Where are the files of \"finished intelligence reports\" maintained on file by the CIA Phy- sics and Electronics Branch, referred to in the realeased administrative documents? Where are the UFO sighting cases that I, as a repre- sentative of NICAP, loaned to the CIA at their request in 1964? The (Continued on next page) \"4."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"UFO Documentation, Cont CIA UFO case files, no doubt very, extensive, are being withheld from the public. UFO waves come and go, and interest fades after each wave...1947, 1952, 1957, 1966-67, and the last wave to date, 1973. How can we break out of the cycle and reach a new plateau of sustained scientific and public interest and support? I propose that we form cross-group documentation teams, drawing on skilled investigators and scientists from all of the UFO groups and private individuals, and focus on building Case Books of high quality assembling under one cover the best information available in at least the following areas: * Physical traces and artifacts (physical analysis) * Medical/physiological evidence cases * Instrument cases (radar, photographs, E-M effect cases.) * Hidden cases (including his- torical documentation) * Abduction reports Such Case Books could provide a powerful new tool in the battle for recognition of UFOs as an important problem. There is an old oriental saying that if you only have one tool, and it is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail. Our basic \"tool\" is UFO reports and our basic problem is nonrecognition of their serious nature. Part of the problem is our own failure to filter out, document, and adequately present the solid core of information in those reports in a way to command attention and res- pect. Allen Hendry in his UFO Hand- book has stressed the importance of the investigative tools we work with; we now need to sharpen up and more clearly focus the best informa- tion we have available as a tool in the battle for recognition of UFOs and their potential importance for hu- mankind. THE CREDIBILITY OF UFO HYPOTHESES: A CRITIQUE By Virgil Staff Stuart Campbell's article (No. 156, Feb. 1981) apparently is in- tended to remind ufologists that they do not understand the source or meaning of the UFO phenomenon. But this can hardly be reckoned as very newsworthy to most of us. With the exception of numerous contactees who may live in their own world, most critically minded ufologists clearly have not arrived at a conclu- sion. In fact, the presence of various interpretations is to be considered as healthy evidence of a willingness to peruse the phenomenon in an ab- sence of agreement as to what this phenomenon signifies. Campbell gently denigrates ufol- ogists for their interpretations, but he provides little data to indicate possible justification for limiting their views to the upper three levels of his chart, when there appear to be no secure interpretations within those levels for certain reportable phenomena. Space does not permit a paragraph by paragraph consider- ation of Campbell's assumptions. But they are rather evenly spread through- out the manuscript, and paragraphs 12-19 are near-total guesswork. Quot- ing the guesses of others, even when these support one's views, does not necessarily increase reliability. Campbell seems to believe that the ETH is the heaviest of those used by ufologists, and he has produced, on page 9, a chart covering degrees of assumption. Without losing one- self in Campbell's assumptions re- garding the nature of science and of the credible, it can be seen that his views would force acceptance of nonsensical identifications into the third level of his chart, even should present levels of technology be in- sufficient to enable comprehension of probable alternatives. What Campbell does not understand is that when third-level assumptions are improbable, then further con- jecture may be demanded. To hold that certain phenomena are actually rare unknowns of the third level is to indicate one's thinking is tied within a straitjacket. If it should appear that the phe- nomenon is not natural â€” as de- fined, and not an artifice of man â€” then it would seem to be either an artifice made by someone else, or a series of particulars for which there is no comprehension. One may argue which of the two is more difficult to believe, but with the level of present understanding, there may not be much agreement. This is our present juncture. In any case, the chart will be inadequate because it may ex- clude certain possible phenomena, and because it makes the leap to alien levels without it being ap- parent that other factors may require inclusion. One of the principal assump- tions in alien artifice hypotheses is not necessarily that alien intelligence exists but that it has a good chance of existing. Campbell's statement that there is no evidence for the former may be strictly correct, but it ignores the views of a host of scholars who lack the arrogance to claim likeli- hood of being alone in the universe. One cannot help wonder if the hos- tility to SETI astronomers does not arise from their own ETH, thus pro- viding certain unintentioned support to the views that ETs could be tech- nologically superior, if not ingeni- ously mobile. Those, who for their own reasons, are inimical to this view, will certainly attempt to locate present day sightings within the chart's Level 3. To argue that we are probably not the only \"intelligence\" in the universe, may be something of a presumption, but it seems hardly a rash one. Most ufologists have no certitude regarding alien in- telligence. To be uncertain is (Continued on next page) 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"UFO Hypotheses, Cont more honest, in the possible absence of sufficient corroborating data, than to locate certain unexplainable phe- nomena in Level 3 and then presume that there is no alien intelligence with us. The denial of alien ability to arrive here only indicates the degree to which such individuals are cul- ture bound by the limitations of their own immediate technology. Of course, if there are no aliens any- where, then they clearly will not be found here. Campbell is unable to make sense out of what, to some, appear as antics, and he seems inclined to presume that these antics indicate either that the aliens are not here, or that they fail to function as we might. Since he would not operate in this fashion, he presumes unlikelihood that they would do so. But none of this has any direct relation to the ETH, nor does it reduce the credibil- ity of the ETH. The ETH may be a sound alternative to various explana- tions presumed to belong in Level 3. At the moment we really do not know. To presume otherwise would be to include a host of items in Level 3 which, in all good sense, do not seem to belong there. To include alL phenomena on the third level â€” even the incomprehensible â€” would remove the need for any Level 4. This is undoubtedly what some would prefer, but to do so would re- quire the adjustment of Level 3 into a menagerie useless for classification. If there is no alien intelligence, then there-can be no place for Level 4 in the chart. And if there is no Level 4, then there will be no Level 4 events. Such a view does not con- sider the nature of individual inci- dents, but rather inserts them into Level 3 prior to investigation. This appears to be instructive concern- ing the nature of scientific method best understood by detractors and various agency apologists, but it has never met the standards of Ufology. Certainly the presumption of a pos- sible Level 4 phenomenon is not greatly larger than one which places all sightings into Level 3 with ex- planations that satisfy only the wild- est reaches of the imagination. In fact, these explanations have been commonplace among the detractors, but they do not convince the increas- ingly large category of citizens who have experienced the phenomenon. One suspects that such explanations may increasingly build lack of re- spect towards the scientific com- munity. With growing numbers of the population apparently becom- ing convinced of the reality of the phenomenon, one can only hope for a renewed willingness to consider the uniqueness of the performance. It is difficult to believe that the search for extraterrestrial life should be anathema to the scientific method merely because there is no unargu- able indication at the present that would prove the same. It is a simple matter to debunk anything that has not been accepted. The belief in an alien advanced technological civili- zation may indeed be unscientific, but the search for such is another matter, as is the attempt to deter- mine if sighting particulars might be unexplainable as planetary phe- nomena. Campbell tells us there is no reason to believe the purported aliens do not think like us, but he should know that there is also no reason to believe that they do. He should be reminded that anything we learn of the purported alien en- counters should be based on the particulars of given sightings, and not merely on assertion and whim. Employment of the words \"cred- ible\" and \"scientific\" can be a cul-de- sac, if these are defined in such manner as to restrict the breadth of one's views. To refuse movement in the direction of Level 4 is to control one's breadth of view because one cannot presently comprehend the phenomenon. One then allocates all sightings to Level 3 though no other reason is given than that it is un- scientific to move further. Theories of scientific method presume an openness to phenom- ena and their study. A useful meth- odology presumes such. Where there is no candor, one may rightfully question the degree to which real knowledge is available. State fund- ing and control of given projects are relevant factors. Where information is not released to the public, and the citizenry are not taken into their government's confidence, there can be no assurance that the public will be capable of making adequate deter- minations. There is reason to believe that the State has not been totally forthright, and since we have not been informed of what is allegedly known, it becomes necessary to ap- proach the subject in our own man- ner, and within our own limitations. This is not a historically invalid ap- proach. In fact, it is quite the opposite since most of us are not privy to agency research findings. To pre- sume there is no censorship, as do some, is to presume that funded pro- grams have produced no informa- tion conducive to furtherance of Level 4 understandings. This is cer- tainly a presumption on the part of agency apologists, and to this writer it seems only intelligent to search for further meanings in a world dedi- cated to providing store-bought interpretations. Campbell's time-travel explana- tions, while somewhat convincing, are in some respects akin to the whisperings of an Australian primi- tive who has never previously ex- perienced 20th century technologi- cal particulars. The writer has never held to these views, but they do not seem totally inane. For example, signals faster than light may not be an impossibility, and should this be true, then such signals directed towards one observer might travel backwards in time with respect to other observers. One is reminded of the Stuckelberg-Feynman concept of a position as an electron inching backwards in time. Godel, in his own calculations, appears to believe that a speed 72 percent that of light would be sufficient to produce time travel backwards. This is not to pre- sume any knowledge of the subject, but only to remind Campbell that opposite views to the conventional are not necessarily totally spurious. Campbell quotes Shklovsky's (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"UFO Hypotheses, Cont Dictum that \"every object must be assumed natural until proved un- natural.\" The word \"proved\" can mean all things to all men, but essen- tially this is the approach employed in field investigationâ€”the chief compromisers being the debunkers who do not comprehend that the dictum should not be a sanctification of the status quo, or intended as a limitation on employment of induc- tive-deductive techniques. Campbell employs various forms of logic and assertion to prove his thesis, but it should be recalled that Occam's Razor, while useful, will pre- dict nothing with certainty. Predic- tions, based on simplicity, are pre- supposed to fit facts that are not available. Since the next fact is never available, one can only indulge in the hope of simplicity. Indeed, the next fact may lead to the next level of complexity. Credibility factors may be a matter of opinion or choice, and the limitation of assumptions in a given example may prove to be less ade- quate than the hypothesis with a more complex assumption pattern. The assumption that UFOs are really third level IFOs has not been indi- cated, and may include more pre- supposition than reality. To say that such a presumption is more credible is to question the very usefulness of the so-called \"credibility factor.\" A dictionary definition of \"credible\" may be more useful: i.e., \"capable of being believed; plausible.\" It may be as foolhardy to hold, as do some, that certain alleged per- ceptions do not existâ€”when there are phenomena that cannot be satis- factorily explainedâ€”as to construct one's philosophy around the exis- tence of such alleged phenomena. Each side then employs presump- tions, with the detractors claiming credibility by taking refuge in defini- tional syntax, or in the creation of tools or charts inadequate to their purpose. New ideas are not neces- sarily forthcoming, nor are new means of interpreting phenomena. What is required is an open mind, AD PLANE IFOs By Wayne LaPorte Lenticular clouds, meteors, air- craft, and balloon IFOs have been with us for some time. However, the lighted advertising plane is a fairly recent newcomer. The comments in this article are based on my personal investigative experiences with ad plane IFOs, and an interview with Tommy Futch, an ad plane pilot for Flying Billboards of Charlotte, N.C. Futch's plane is a Cessna 150 which is a high-wing pleasure plane. It's powered by a 100 hp Continental engine located in the nose. Suspend- ed below the wings is a 44 foot long by 10 foot wide array of wires con- taining 360 6V light bulbs. The matrix array runs below the fuselage from one wingtip to the other. Braces ex- tending down from the wings hold the wire contraption in place. The sign's message is controlled by an onboard computer. A taped message is fed into the computer. When Futch is over the \"target area,\" he flicks a switch and 10 foot tall letters appear to flow in space below the plane from left to right. This, in- cidentally, is the same type of system that's used on the Goodyear Blimp. and the willingness or ability to follow. It is this writer's view that Mr. Campbell has some useful thoughts presented for the wrong reasons. We feel no compunction to support theories we do not hold, and since we accept none of these with any certainty, we are not disquieted by critically viewing the assumptions made by those who are anathema to the assumptions of others. It is a healthy experience to view the guesses of othersâ€”as it is one's own. Our own assumption is that some- thing bizarre is taking place that calls for evaluation. Such evaluation necessarily requires some assump- tions and we are not concerned about these as long as we recognize them as such. Futch flies the Cessna at about 1,500 feet. At this height the ap- parent size of the plane (at arm's length) is about three times the ap- parent size of the full moon (or about three aspirins placed side by side at arm's length). Some witnesses often mistake Futch's plane for a blimp. There are two reasons why. He must fly the plane as slow as possible at a high angle of attack (the plane's nose must be angled upward). Normally, Futch flies the Cessna at about 45 mph which is just above the stall speed (speed below which the plane will lose aerodynamic lift and won't fly). To fly this slow he must run the engine at a slow speed. Consequent- ly, because of the slow engine speed and high angle of attack, witnesses on the ground hear only a muted engine sound and think the plane is actually \"some kind of blimp.\" Although some witnesses mis- take the ad plane for a blimp, more misidentify it as a UFO. The lighted sign is the main reason. On a clear night it can be seen for miles. How- ever, to see the message clearly you must be directly in the plane's path and within about one-half mile of the approaching craft. Those not familar with the ad plane and view- ing it from off to one side often mis- perceive the aircraft as an alien UFO! From a distance, many see it as a shimmering mass of light or glow- ing craft (usually discoid, cigar- shaped, or lens-shaped). Within a few miles of the plane witnesses can make out the sequencing lights. Many think they are viewing a craft with cabin lights, sequencing lights, or fixed lights on a rotating part of the UFO. Both the red and green wingtip navigational lights can be seen as the plane approaches (note: these lights can't be seen when the airplane is (Continued on next page) 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Ad Plane, Continued moving away). However, one of the lights can be obscured by the wing as the aircraft is making a turn. Wit- nesses viewing the turning craft may report seeing only a green or a red light, depending on which way the plane was turning. The Cessna 150 has a small red light on the top leading edge of the tail and a small white light on the back of the tail. Witnesses seeing the plane approach often describe the \"UFO\" as having a red-lighted dome. And, people observing the ad plane as it's flying away often report that the UFO has a white signal light on top of the craft. The sign lights are incandescent, meaning they give off white light with a yellowish-cast (same as a light bulb in a reading lamp). However, in haze or pollution these lights might appear as orange or red. Also, the sign lights are on a wire array sus- pended below the plane. This means the lights can also be seen from behind the plane. Of course, you can't make out the message, but you can see a flickering glow as the various bulbs light up in sequence. Futch's ad plane is equipped with a brightener. This is a device which at a flick of a switch can throw a surge of current to brighten the sign lights. The purpose of the bright- ener is to draw people's attention. And, it does. Some even think the \"UFO\" is pulsating or signaling to them! The most common description of the .nl plane \"UFO\" is a bell- shaped discoid with flashing or se- quencing lights on the bottom. However, I've also had the ad plane described as ovoid with rows of lights, turtle-shaped with bottom lights, football-shaped with win- dows, hamburger-shaped with cabin lights, and lens-shaped with blink- ing lights. My advice to any UFO investi- gator is to establish good relations with any ad plane pilots in their area. Many pilots like Futch, carry a flight log which lists the flight path and ap- proximate time the plane was flying. North Carolina Advertising Plane Most ad plane cases can be easily solved by checking the encounter location and times with the pilot's log. However, some witnesses are hesitant to accept an ad plane ex- planation, while others will readily accept what you tell them â€” some- times in a humorous manner. One night a very excited young woman called the Charlotte police to report a UFO. They referred her to me, and I interviewed the woman over the phone. It sounded like an ad plane case, so I called Futch's resi- dence. He wasn't in as he was up flying. However, his wife was at home and she informed me that Futch was flying in the area that the young woman lived. 1 called her back and informed her that she was viewing an ad plane. To this she re- plied, \"Well, at least Charlotte is safe from an alien attack tonight.\" UFO DA TA MAR T (A service for MUFON members/ subscribers, except commercial en- terprises.)

HumCat Classification: Serial #0243, Type B (entity observed getting in and/or out of UFO). Introduction / Toward the end of August 1954, newspapers around the world amused their readers with the enter- taining story of two Norwegian sis- ters who met a \"spaceman\" while picking blueberries in a valley near \"Mofjell.\" (The name of the town was Mosjoen.) This \"spaceman,\" who seemed friendly enough, ad- dressed the women in an unknown language, drew some pictures of circles that suggested stars or planets (hence leading the girls to deduce he came from \"outer space\"), and led them to a clearing where he climbed into his \"flying saucer\" and took off. The story, naturally enough, be- came a sensation. A day or so later, it came crashing to earth (to all intents and purposes) with the denoue- ment: the \"spaceman\" turned out to be a U.S. Army helicopter pilot from Council Bluffs, Iowa, who was in Norway on NATO maneuvers at the time of the sisters' encounter. The \"denouement\" was offered with great good humor by the wire services, except that it turned out to be about as dependable as the name \"Mofjell.\" The pilot was soon lo- cated in Stuttgart, Germany, where he denied having been anywhere near the Oeydalen valley. Not sur- prisingly, the newspapers had by then tired of the story, so the Ameri- can pilot's denial went largely un- reported. (See accompanying press stories.) Perhaps because most people were left with the impression that the Norwegian encounter had been satisfactorily explained by that American helicopter pilot, it is diffi- cult to find references to it in the UFO literature. You cannot find a summary of it in Jacques Vallee's otherwise nearly all-inclusive ap- pendix of his \"Type I\" cases in Pass- port to Magonia (Regnery, Chicago, 1969). You will search in vain for it in Charles Bowen's classic compen- dium of UFO occupant reports, The Humanoids (American hardcover edition published by Regnery, 1969). Its omission from that reference is curious, however, since The Human- oids first appeared in 1966 as a special edition of Flying Saucer Review, and it was in an early issue of FSR that one of the few published accounts of the Norwegian case is found: a state- ment by one of the two sisters, Edith Jacobsen, translated from a Nor- wegian published interview, appear- ed in Vol. I, No. 4 (issue for Septem- ber/October, 1955), pages 6 & 7. The one book in which you can find a reference to the Norwegian case is, curiously, Edward J. Rup- pelt's Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (Doubleday, Garden City, N.Y., 1956). Ruppelt seems to have swallowed the helicopter pilot story hook, line, and saucer, for on page 308 he writes:\"... A few days later it was discovered that the man from 'outer space' was a lost USAF (sicâ€” TB) helicopter pilot who was flying with NATO forces in Norway. As I've always said, 'Ya gotta watch those Air Force pilotsâ€”especially those shaggy-haired ones from Brooklyn'.\" Ruppelt, whose signals were crossed on the pilot's correct service, didn't even seem to know that the pilot was from Iowa and not Brooklyn, but that didn't matter as long as the story could be turned into a joke. The Norwegian incident is in- cluded in the Project Blue Book case files as a secondary report, where the case material consists exclusive- ly of several wire service news stories. The full-length report by Oddvar Larsen is presented here in English translation for the first time. OPERATION \"BLUEBERRY\" By Oddvar Larsen Mosjoen is the name of a little seaside town in the Nordland county of northern Norway. It is surround- ed by mountains and narrow valleys, and most of the population are de- scended from farmers or fishermen who in recent decades have aban- doned their parents' way of life, becoming merchants, craftsmen or intellectual workers. Everyone knows one another, at least on sight, and the common feeling of most is one of easy-going, sedate compla- cency. If a man falls off a roof and breaks one of his legs, it is a subject of wide interest; if he breaks both of them the story is a sensation. (Continued on next page) 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Blueberry, Continued Then one August day, in 1954, two young ladies turned up and claimed that they had seen a landed \"flying saucer\" and that they had \"talked\" with the pilot. They were able to give a detailed description of his aircraft, and they could tell how the fellow was dressed and what he looked like. In short, they turned the town upside down. And not just the townâ€”oh, no! Their story created a controversy which divided the Norwegian people into two camps in a few hours, and that was just the beginning. By the next day the two ladies were known all over the world. They were in- vited to participate in a Swedish radio show, they received telephone calls and letters from foreign news- papers they scarcely knew of, and they found their photographs on the cover of a picture magazine which ordinarily features stars like Marilyn Monroe, or royal weddings. They were scared stiff. At the time this happened, I was the managing editor of Helgeland, a newspaper published in Mo i Rana, some miles north of Mosjoen. I was also in charge of our Mosjoen edi- tion, Nordlands FolkMad, which was furnished with local news by our staff reporter, Mr. Hans Almaas. One morning just before the first edition was going to press, the Mo i Rana office heard from Mr. Almaas by telephone. He had talked to a little bo>, he said, who had been told by somebody that they heard a cer- tain Miss Edith Jacobsen, 24, and her sister, Mrs. Aasta Solvang, 32, had seen a \"flying saucer\" and met a man from another world. Perhaps, sug- gested Mr. Almaas, it would be a good idea if we did a little research. He had been more or less acquaint- ed with the two ladies all his life, and they couldn't tell a lie if they tried to. Our first reaction was to tell Mr. Almaas to stay away from the bottle. But the young man's reputation was as solid as an iron foundation, and even if he had exaggerated when he insisted that the girls were incap- able of making up tall tales, it was 10 quite obvious that he had some good reason for paying attention to them. From that moment on, we were into it. We rang up the Mosjoen police headquarters on the telephone and asked the officer in charge if he had heard anything about the two ladies and the man from another planet. He hadn't. We then created a riot at the local telephone office request- ing long distance calls to all Mosjoen subscribers listed under the name of Solvang or Jacobsen, or something similar, only to find out that they were the wrong parties. Then the Mosjoen police officer telephoned us and scared us out of our wits, tell- ing us that the ladies, who were brought in for questioning, had con- firmed all the rumors and described the \"space man\" right down to minute details about the length of his hair. Fifteen minutes later the story bit the pavements. That was Tues- day, August 24, 1954. The incident described by the two ladies was said to have taken place some days be- fore, on Friday, August 20th. Here is the story as told by Miss Edith Jacobsen to one of our re- porters: \"My sister and I had gone up into Oeydalen (a valley close to Mosjoen) to pick raspberries, but we didn't find any, and instead we began to pick blueberries near a marsh I knew of. At the time we went up into the valley, we had been together with a male relative, but he left us, and we didn't meet again until we were on our way home several hours later. \"As my sister and I were busy picking blueberries, we suddenly noticed something that moved be- hind some bushes not far from us. I remember that I said: A sheep, I guess. But it was a man. \"It has been written in some newspapers that we got scared. That is not true. The man who came out from behind the bushes looked very ordinaryâ€”like all other people, that isâ€”and he smiled to us in an open and reassuring way. He had a dark complexion, and his hair was very long, but not down to his shoulders, as some newspapers have stated. It was a haircut of the kind which was very popular with Norwegian boys about 1946 (as with Johnny 'Tarzan' Weissmullerâ€”OL). He had very nice teeth, and he was of rather average stature. He seemed friendly and charming from the very first moment. \"He was dressed in a tight-fitting suit. I could see neither buttons nor zippers, but it was furnished with a broad belt. The shoes I did not notice. \"He walked towards us and smiled, and stretched out his hand. I smiled.back and stretched out my hand, thinking of course that he was some man who happened to come around and that he wanted to shake hands, like people used to do. But instead of shaking it, he laid the palm of his hand close to the palm of my hand so that they touched, and then he'withdrew it. Then he began to talk, but we didn't understand a word. Neither did he understand me when I tried to speak to him in Eng- lish, German and French. (Most Norwegians speak English, and in high school they learn German and enough French to make themselves understoodâ€”OL.) I have been asked if perhaps his language might be one of the East European ones. I don't think so. I have heard Russian on the radio, and it sounded rather staccato to my ears. The stranger's language was very melodious, and it seemed as if it didn't consist of separate words, but flowed freely like a smooth stream. \"By now it was quite obvious to the man that our conversation was useless, and from one of his pockets he took something which looked like a little mirror. It was greyish. Using a pencil, or something like it, he drew some circles and showed them to us. He pointed at one of the circles, then at us and then he lifted both arms indicating all of the sur- roundings, the marsh, the bushes, and so forth. Then he pointed at himself and one of the other circles. (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Blueberry, Continued 'Planet' is a word which came to my mind much later. At the time it happened, I simply didn't think of the fellow as 'peculiar' in any way. He was just a stranger, that's all. \"The man made a sign that he wanted us to go with him. He turned and began to walk, and nearby we came to a clearing where we saw an object on the ground. To me it looked like two pot covers put together, rim-to-rim. It measured from six to nine feet across, and was approxi- mately five feet high. I am positive that the man couldn't stand up in- side itâ€”he would have to sit down. As to the color, I don't know how to describe it. It was a kind of blue or grey, I'm not sure. \"So far as I can remember, it was at this moment that it dawned on me for the first time that something very odd was happening to me and my sister. We were standing quite close to the thing when the man nodded and smiled, and then opened a hatch and boarded the craft. The last we saw of him was his hand. He waved, and then he closed the hatch behind him. \"The next minute the craft left the ground and smoothly ascended some 40 or 50 feet. The only sound we were able to hear was a humming, or a very soft buzzâ€”absolutely no engine roar. At the same time, the craft started to rotate around its axis at an increasing speed, and then all of a sudden it rose straight upwards and disappeared. The velocity was quite fantastic.\" The strange craft left the two girls in a rather confused state of mind. They felt sure that nobody in Mosjoen would believe them, and if the story got out, the chances were that they would be made a laughing stock all over town. So they decided to keep their mouths shut. Several days passed, and by then the strain had become too much for the married sister, Mrs. Solvang. Her husband understood that something was worrying her and began to ask questions, and as a result she told him everything. The next day the story was out. From the very beginning the Oeydalen affair became a topic of nationwide interest. I have already mentioned that the Norwegian people were divided into two camps, and I mean it quite literally. One side fek sure that the girls were making up the best fairy tale since the days of Hans Christian Andersen; the other side was half-inclined to be- lieve them. The main debate ran like this: (1) Some newspapers stated that the girls had read Flying Saucers Have Landed, by Desmond Leslie and George Adamski, and had discussed the book a bit too much. The girls' response was \"No,\" they had dis- cussed it like everybody else, but they had never read it. (2) What about the relative who had been with them? Why hadn't he seen anything? The ladies answered that they had been walking together with him as they went up into the valley, but then he had left them. They hadn't the faintest idea of how far or near he had been to them when the occurrence took place. As a matter of fact, they didn't meet again until they were on their way home. (3) How could the sisters explain the fact that the police were unable to find traces of \"the thing?\" (The police conducted an investigation at the site, with negative results.) Well, the ladies answered, as a matter of fact they did go with the police to the spot where the \"saucer\" had landed, and each had picked out the site independently. That was true. But they had seen the \"saucer\" on Fri- day, and the police had visited the site on the following Wednesday, five days later. If the grass had been crushed, it would have plenty of time to rise again. (4) Then came the day that the most influential Norwegian news- paper, Aftenposten, reported that the ladies had seen an American heli- copter and that they had talked to the pilot, Mr. Billy Fauret. The ladies' response.was \"No,\" and this time they were supported by the police. There had been no helicopter in the Oeydalen Valley on the day in ques- tion; this was confirmed by the pilot himself who some days later was located in Stuttgart, Germany. He told a United Press reporter that Afternposten was wrong, and that he had never been to Oeydalen in all his life. And that is where it all stands. I have been asked hundreds of times what I myself think of the Oeydalen affair. I don't know, I really don't. I have witnessed some very clever and very sane reporters com- ing back from interviews with the ladies, believing every single word of their odd story. I have talked with reliable men and women who have known the girls since they were children, just to hear that they must have told the truth; anything else would have been impossible. Why haven't I seen the girls my- self? Oh, noâ€”not me! What a situa- tion that would be, if I came back fully convinced that \"flying saucers\" really existed. I am still a rather young man looking forward to better jobs, and I wouldn't want news- paper owners to get any bad ideas. (End of Larsen account.) Comments With candid, if humorous, cyni- cism, Oddvar Larsen frames his ac- count of the Norwegian encounter in all too familiar terms. His attitude is not so different from that of Lt. Pessca when the latter was asked how he felt about the Santa Maria Airport incident. (No. 160, June 1981) Even though the guard's story remained consistent through three days of interviews, Pessca confessed that \"I personally don't believe.\" So, it doesn't matter how credible a wit- ness is, or how compelling the cir- cumstances of his story areâ€”the will to disbelieve is just as compelling, and just as arbitrary, as the \"will to believe\" that is so often invoked by the UFO skeptic. The Oeydalen and Santa Maria encounters, taking place within a month of each other, are presented (Continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Blueberry, Continued in sequence for obvious reasons, de- scribing as they do almost identical situations, featuring two ordinary, human UFOnauts, whose behavior and attitudes are practically the same. With so many similar details, these two UFO events provide a useful example of a very particular type of encounterâ€”that is, direct confronta- tion. Even though the language spoken by the beings in each case was incomprehensible, the broader, implicit message of each event was clearly unmistakable. Lima (Ohio) News.

By Larry W. Bryant When I undertook this column about 16 months ago, I had no illu- sions that its contents would hasten the resolution of \"the UFO problem.\" I still have none. What I set out to do in this spin- off from Just Cause (the newsletter of Citizens Against UFO Secrecyâ€” CAUS) was to offer MUFON mem- bers and other UFO-oriented citi- zens a certain perspective, a certain focus on the policies/programs/ practices involved in one aspect of the problem: official government secrecy in the acquisition, analysis, and dissemination of hard-core UFO data. After several thousand words of exploration of the issues and com- mentary upon the relevant research findings, we're nearing a crossroads. If this column, and the work it repre- sents, were to cease, what then? Who would care? How valuable to civilized society is the result of that effort? Questions for a philosopher, of course. And, if the composing of this column doesn't qualify its author as a philosopher, then perhaps its digestion and later appraisal by its readership will so qualify him. The duty of a philosopher, as I see it, is to be aware of one's limita- tions in analysis and interpretation of facts and eventsâ€”and, through- out, to maintain a sense of humor. That said, let me proceed to review the status quo, to raise some more philosophic questions, and to point the reader in the direction of answers. First of all, the legal scene: GSW Vs. CIA. Of course, the worldwide publicity about the Free- dom of UFO Information case of Ground Saucer Watch, Inc., versus U. S. Central hitelligence Agency continues to grasp the imaginations of sea- soned UFOlogist and detached ob- server alike. For this ground-breaking case of anti-UFO secrecy is the foot- in-the-door by which can be dis- cerned the general outline of the picture painted over the last 30-odd years by the Federal UFO policy- makers. But that crack in the CIA's picture window may be mending. Now on appeal from a district court decision in favor of the Agency, the GSW cause celebre has spawned three other freedom-of-information law suits, all filed by the public- interest group Citizens Against UFO Secrecy: CAUS Vs. U. S. DEFENSE INTEL- LIGENCE AGENCY. Here, we have the case of an agency's failure to comply fully with the spirit of the U. S. Freedom of Information Act, speci- fically as to conducting a thorough search of its UFO-related files. And here again we have the U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia, on a motion for summary judge- ment, ruling in favor of the defend- ant. CAUS plans no appeal of the de- cision, choosing instead to concen- trate its limited resources on the CIA appeal. CAUS Vs. U. S. FEDERAL AVIA- TION ADMINISTRATION. Can an agency levy whatever the traffic will bear when it comes to setting fees for documents sought via freedom-of- information requests? And can that agency act in an arbitrary and capri- cious way to deny a requestor access to its UFO-related records? The FAA answers to those questions must have satisfied the judge, be- cause he ruled in favor of the agency. Again, owing to its limited resources, CAUS plans no appeal. CAUS Vs. U. S. NATIONAL SE- CURITY AGENCY. This is the real biggie in this trio of post-GSW litiga- tion, according to CAUS counsel Peter A. Gersten. Closely aligned to the GSW-CIA case, this effort to make the NSA leadership fully ac- countable to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act now is on appeal from the District Court's judgment in favor of the defendant. Chances that either the CIA or the NSA appeal will bear fruit for the CAUS harvest of Federal UFO docu- mentation are slim. Indeed, the foot- in-the-door is getting numb from the tight fit. And if recent develop- ments within these two agencies are any indication, then the door, when it finally slams shut, may be too tough ever to re-open. For example, the National Se- curity Agency long has been lobby- ing Congress for dispensation from the provisions of the Freedom of In- formation Act â€” on grounds that by definition the NSA mission and modus operand! are too sensitive to bear critical viewing by the public eye. Recent FOIA court rulings in favor of the Agency tend to strengthen its position. Will Congress relent and let the Agency's past/present/ future UFO documentation off the hook? Answer: only if we UFO- oriented citizens remain apathetic enough to let this happen. Now, perhaps most disturbing in the recent reports of intelligence- agency hostility toward the Act and its users is the prospect that the Central Intelligence Agency is (1) secretly trying to revive its infamous role in so-called domestic intelligence (whereby it was able to infiltrate UFO research groups and partici- pate in \"UFO news management\"); (2) openly trying to get itself absolv- ed from any FOIA compliance. As to the first point, it seems that Congress won't let any ClA agents (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"AIRCRAFT AND \"AIRCRAFT\" By Robert Wanderer (MUFON Research Specialist in Communications) You see a light moving in the night sky. Your first thought: air- craft. It comes closer, and you see the typical pattern of wingtip lights, you hear the sound, you dimly make out the shape of a plane. Your first thought, aircraft, is confirmed and may now be considered \"fact.\" You see another light moving in the night sky. Again, your first thought is aircraft. But as it comes closer, you realize that it's moving faster than any plane can. The light's colors and pattern of intensity are like nothing you've ever seen, you hear no sound, you cannot make out any shape. Calling this a craft is thus \"inference,\" not fact. Secrecy, Continued resume their earlier, unfettered counterintelligence activities on the home front; the CIA leadership, in fact, avers it seeks no such resump- tion. But if the Agency does succeed in getting the Freedom of Informa- tion Act off its back, isn't it conceiv- able that eventually the Agency could slip back into its evil ways with assurance that the public no longer would have a ready device to detect the change? And when the current GSW/ CAUS litigation ends, what tool can UFO-oriented citizens use to pry loose from the Agency any future collection of UFO-related records? These questions for the UFO philosopher have wider implications in the body politic, of course â€” not the least of which centers on the issue of governmental credibility. If 90 percent of America's adult popu- lation disbelieves in the govern- ment's official position on the reality of UFO's, what does this tell us about the survivability of our basic institu- tions â€” especially those that depend on a high level of public support in times of crisis? 14 A crucial distinction. Fact is what you see; inference is how you inter- pret what you see. What you saw in the second case might be termed an alleged craft, or what I thought was a craft, or simply a \"craft\" with quota- tion marks around it. Those quota- tion marks or modifiersâ€”in both your writing and your thinkingâ€”are vital in a UFO investigation They also help us avoid that mon error of holding on to our fi : tenta- tive conclusion even when later ob- servation makes our initial theory much less likely. Consider the famous Travis Wal- ton case. Walton and his six co- workers are in a truck returning in the dark from a long day of tree thinning in a remote Arizona forest, and they see a \"dazzling sight\" just a few yards off the ground. One man says, \"My God, it's a flying saucer.\" Then, during the next few para- graphs of Walton's book describing the experience, this whatever-it-was is termed a disc, a craft, a shipâ€”all without quotation marks or modifiers. 1 We can understand the cry of \"flying saucer\" in the frightening surprise of that confrontation. But months later when Walton wrote the book he neglected to qualify what he saw. Because he did not distinguish between fact and inference, and be- cause he and his cohorts were locked into their first theory, they could not consider the possibility that they might have seen a rare and unex- plained natural event. Let's go back to the aircraft sight- ing in the second paragraph of this article. That was based on \"UFO Sighting in Mexico\" in a recent issue of this journal. 2 A particularly good example of the problem, because author Walter Blaney comes across as a competent and accurate observer, yet he fails to make the fact/inference distinction, and he stays with his original theory of aircraft even when what he sees no longer fits. He first sees \"what I thought to be some jet airplanes coming toward me.\" But in the next sentence, and on throughout the article, he refers to what he's seeing as craft (without quotation marks or modifiers), even as he notes that the colors and pulsa- tions and speeds he was seeing were quite incompatible with conventional aircraft. He points out, curiously: \"I could not see the craft themselves, but only the light which they emitted.\" A few paragraphs later he even de- duces from the pattern of moving lights that he is seeing \"saucer-shaped craft.\" Most remarkably, he says \"I know how easy it is to be fooled by what one sees,\" but nevertheless insists \"I know them to be craft far advanced from anything the general public knows about as far as conven- tional aircraft are concerned.\" Most people will agree with Blaney that aircraft was a reasonable theory to tentatively explain what he first saw. But it quickly became apparent that he saw only lights, not an actual aircraft. The only aircraft he \"saw\" were the ones he created in his perception. A quick rundown on how we perceive: From the vast panorama always around us, we choose certain things of interest for our eyes to notice. Within a split-second we do a quick \"computer check\" of our memory to find similar material already in our brain. Then we construct a \"picture in our head\" which is our personal creation in which we combine what we have chosen to look at and what we have chosen from our memory to relate that to. (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Aircraft, Continued The picture in our head, of course, is not the same as the \"real event\" out there. As a practical matter, we can agree that certain sights and sounds make up aircraft, and we can consider that aircraft a fact. We get into trouble, however, when we make an inference and then treat that inference as if it were a fact. People can agree on facts, but we disagree about inferences. And unless we use quotation marks and modifiers and other such qualifiers when we talk about inferences such as Blaney's \"aircraft,\" we are severely limiting our chances of finding explanations for events that puzzle us. When I brought this matter up with Richard Hall, the editor of this journal, he agreed on the impor- tance of making the distinction be- tween fact (observation) and infer- ence (interpretation), but asked, \"Why shouldn't one believe in his interpretation of what he saw if he is a critical observer?\" Unfortunately, someone who is a critical observer is not necessarily a valid interpreter; Blaney gives the impression of accu- rate observation, but when he tells us he \"knows\" they are some far- advanced kind of \"craft,\" he is stat- ing his inference, his estimate of probability, without telling us what other factors have gone into his assessment. What alternate explanation is there for what Blaney saw? One problem in answering such a ques- tion is that because Blaney was con- vinced that what he saw were ad- vanced aircraft, he did not investi- gate any other possibilities. In glanc- ing through my own files as I write, I note UFO cases from a temperature inversion, 3 radar beams bouncing off clouds, 4 electricity leaking from a high-tension power line, 5 and a swarm of moths illuminated by atmospheric electricity. 6 While none of those situa- tions would seem to apply here, some other environmental factor might well be the explanation. Unless we keep our options open with accu- rate use of language, we'll never find that explanation. The need for quotation marks and other qualifiers to help us keep facts and inferences separate is not confined, of course, to instances of \"craft\" as in the Blaney case and the Travis Walton one. An equally seri- ous situationâ€”one that might hold the UFO movement up to public ridiculeâ€”surrounds the hypnotiz- ing of people who have had some sort of UFO experience. Under hyp- nosis, they come up with a story, usually of being taken aboard a UFO, being given a physical examination, and having various adventures with \"aliens\" before returning. These are called \"abductions\"â€”but these are seldom if ever qualified as \"what the person under hypnosis experienced as an abduction,\" or as an \"alleged abduction,\" or even as an \"abduc- tion\" with quotation marks around it. In these cases, the experience is a private, personal one: there is no supporting \"hard\" evidence or inde- pendent testimony that an abduct- ion occurred. Is it \"real\"? It's un- doubtedly \"real\" to the person under hypnosis, but there's no way of deter- mining if it's \"real\" in the more general sense. There is considerable warning in the UFO literature about the dangers of hypnosis: the Hynek/ Vallee book points out that hypnotic subjects \"are extremely compliant,\" and if you ask for a UFO story, they'll come up with a UFO story; subjects \"fabricate\" material from \"wishful thinking, fantasies, dreams.\" 7 Under such circumstances, quotation marks are desperately needed around those \"abductions.\" Even the term \"unidentified fly- ing object\" itself is an unfortunate choice. We think of an \"object\" as something solid, and by using that word we tend to eliminate many possibilities from consideration, such as reflections, clouds, and electrical phenomena. The word \"flying\" im- plies movement in the sky, whereas many UFOs are on or near the ground, or even if in the sky may not be moving. More confusing, because it involves such a subtle assumption, is that we think of \"flying\" as imply- ing conscious control, so again we tend to exclude natural phenomena. As a practical matter, it is too late to change the expression \"unidenti- fied flying object\" to something more accurate and specific. But I think it's useful to \"think in quotes\"â€”to put those quotation marks around UFOs when you think about them, as a reminder to yourself that this par- ticular one you're looking at or think- ing about might well turn out to be what more accurately might be called an \"event\" rather than an \"object\"â€” some sort of electrical or electro- magnetic or meteorological or other activity. Whether you put quotation marks around \"UFO\" or not, they or some other qualifier are vital when talking and thinking about \"craft\" and \"abductions\" when we do not have sufficient hard evidence to consider them a \"fact.\" NOTES & REFERENCES 1.

Story (William Morrow and Co.,Inc. New York, 1981). 290 pp. $12.95. Story, who last year, with J. Richard Greenwell, gave us that excellent compilation, The Encyclopedia of UFOs, now presents his personal views on the subject. Despite its good points, the book is on the whole disappointing. It is almost entirely derivative. There are very few new facts or ideas. For example, Chapter 2, \"The Modern Age of Flying Saucers,\" re- peats yet again historical material that everyone is familiar with the subject has read a dozen times. Un- less Story felt that he was writing for readers quite new to the subject, surely to retread this well-trodden ground was unnecessary. Puzzling inclusions of material are accompanied by equally puzzl- ing omissions. In Chapter 1, \"The First UFOs,\" Story discusses in detail the cave paintings in France and Spain that have been thought by some UFOlogists to include draw- ings of \"spaceships with landing gear.\" But he omits two important aspects of the \"ancient astronauts\" theory: first, his own very com- mendable work in exposing the ab- surdities of the theories of von Daniken, who is still widely read and uncritically believed; and second, the curious religious beliefs held by the Dogon tribe of Africa, described in The Sirius Mystery, by Robert Temple. No discussion of possible ancient astronauts is complete with- out including these books. Another extraordinary conflict occurs in the same chapter, in the section on biblical UFOs. Here Story chooses as an example of UFO phenomena in the scriptures the \"pillar of cloud by day and pillar of fire by night\" that guided the Israel- ites in their 40-year wanderings. Of all biblical \"UFOs\" this seems the least likely â€” unless one is prepared to accept a sighting that lasted for 40 years. But as for Ezekiel's wheel, that 16 does not appear .at all in Story's discussion. Having dealt so unevenly with the historical aspects of UFOs, Story takes up, in Part II, the \"elusive hard data\" â€” physical traces and photo- graphs. The chapter on traces in- cludes a great mixture â€” everything from three cases of \"blobs\" (Fortean but irrelevant, since no UFO activity was reported in any of the three cases described) to humanoid bod- ies (discussed unfairly, it seems to me, under the heading \"The Scully Hoax\"; Len Stringfield's data are included, but it is clear that Story does not accept dead UFO occu- pants, or abductions either). I was greatly surprised to read that Story calls the Socorro, New Mexico, case \"highly dubious,\" \"not deserving the high credibility rating that it gets from the majority of UFO proponents.\" His judgment is ap- parently based on statements made by P. Klass. But Story himself, in another part of the book, criticizes fdass's plasma theory vigorously, and elsewhere warns the UFO stu- dent to be aware of the bias of investigators. Surely he knows that Mass's aim is to debunk every sight- ing as misinterpretation, or as result- ing from fear and confusion on the part of witnesses, or as deliberate hoaxing. Why, then, does he take Klass on Socorro so seriously? Other matters discussed in this chapter on traces are Delphos, Kansas; the Utatuba magnesium; three angel-hair cases; the 1967 re- port from Falcon Lake â€” the Steven Michalak case (here Story hints at psychological explanation); Austral- ian \"saucer nests\", and alleged UFO landings in soy bean fields. The chapter on photographs is excellent. Instead of the usual stale warnings about len flares and hoax photographs, Story simply presents three strong photographic cases: the Trent photos at McMinnville, Oregon, and the Mariana film taken at Great Falls, Montana, both in 1950; and the Trindade Island, Brazil, photo series of 1958. The New Zealand film of 1978 appears as one of Story's \"ten best cases\" in the next chapter. In the Introduction he has told us that he circularized UFOlogists asking each one to submit such a \"ten best\" list, and that he was amazed at the lack of consensus, which obliged him to select his own ten best. For my part, I am surprised at his amazement. Among them, UFOlogists have a roster of strong cases that probably run into the hundreds, and to expect agreement on a mere ten was naive. All of the cases he presents are indeed strong, and have been well publicized. Together, they illustrate most of the striking circumstances and phenomena in UFO history: attempted interception by jet planes, police involvement, radar confirma- tion of visual sightings, animal re- actions, E-M effects, etc. All met Story's triple test: more than one witness, strong documentation, and witness integrity. Three others are reports from abroad: Lakenheath, England, 1956; Boiani, New Guinea, 1959; and Iran, 1976. Six are domes- tic: Nash-Fortenberry, 1952; Level- land, Texas, 1957; Betty and Barney Hill, 1961 (Story accepts the UFO with occupants but rejects the ab- duction story); Exeter, New Hamp- shire, 1965; The Portage County, Ohio, chase, 1966; and the Coyne helicopter case, 1973. For most of these, Story exa- mines the \"rational\" explanations offered by debunkers, and shows how dismally these explanations fail to fit the reported facts. In \"The Search for Patterns,\" Story briefly classifies UFOs by shape and structure and points out similarities in behavior. He also mentions some of the temporal and geographical patterns that research- ers think they have detected and have attributed to various alien mo- tives for examining Earth. He pro- perly points out the weakness of all pattern theories; namely, that no one really knows how many genuine sightings have occurred, or when, or .where. Coming in his last chapter, to the second part of his title, Story points out two major limitations that (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Story Review, Continued hamper scientists in trying to un- ravel the UFO enigma: First, these phenomena do not lend themselves to analysis by the customary scientif- ic methods; and second, scientists are human beings subject to the same biases and prejudices as other people (here he refers to a most interesting study of the psychology of scientists, conducted by M.J. Mahoney of Pennsylvania State University). The Foreword, by Thornton Page, a member of the famed Robertson Panel of 1953 and now with the Johnson Space Center in Houston, is extremely interesting. Page charact- erizes the writings of Condon, Menzel, and Philip Klass as \"a regret- table pseudo-^scientific attempt to 'debunk' the whole UFO matter\"; says that the Condon Report seem- ed to be unscientific and inconsist- ent; notes \"how difficult it is to explain some of the reliable UFO reports\" and endorses Story's re- commendation for a philosophical and epistemological approach to the subject as a basis for answering the central question, What is the nature of scientific evidence? (But will this approach actually elucidate the mys- tery of UFOs, or merely breed more controversy?) The Appendix, on the other hand, entitled \"The Limitations of Science,\" by Bruce Murray, Director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, is standard- issue orthodoxy regarding Forteana, complete with the usual jumbled categories, superficial comments, and complacency that we have en- countered so often before. Throughout, Story is diligent in expressing skepticism about certain aspects of UFOlogy. But on balance, he is clearly a \"believer,\" refusing to dismiss the hard-core evidence with the sweeping generalizations used by the debunkers. Perhaps, when he has become familiar with the many complexities of the UFO picture, he will supply us with a more complete book and one that does not so often give the impression of deja vu. Isabel Davis BOOK REVIEW Missing Time: A Documented Study ofTJFO Abductions, By Budd Hopkins (N.Y.: Richard Marek Pub- lishers, 1981) 258 p.; $12.95. This book should not be read by impressionable children. The very idea that alien entities are mesmeriz- ing and abducting us, and perform- ing medical/biological tests on us, one by one, stealthily, covering their tracks by inducing amnesia in their subjects, is the stuff of nightmares. By all common sense, it is also pre- posterous. In presenting the results of hyp- notic regression sessions during which this scenario has emerged, the author displays a proneness to speculate and assume particulars beyond the given evidence to sup- port the view that it is really hap- pening. His view is that aliens are using us as laboratory specimens for reasons unknown. His departure from objective or neutral reporting, though, is excusable on the grounds that the stories emerging under hyp- nosis are astoundingly congruent. The simplest hypothesis is that it is really happening. The best alternatives anyone has been able to come up with are that: (1) the stories are confabulations of hypnosis, subtly drawn from absorb- ing cultural lore about UFOs or tak- ing hints from the investigators; (2) each of us carries within ourselves the raw materials for an abduction story, in an archetypal sense, which may be triggered into the conscious mind as a modern myth decked out in the cultural clothing of today (Hilary Evans, No. 158, April 1981); or (3) someâ€”at leastâ€”of the ab- ductees may be revivifying birth trauma emotions and sensations, for which parallel data exists in LSD experiments (Alvin Lawson, paper to be presented at September 1981 CUFOS Conference). Although the reliability of hyp- nosis as a truth-seeking technique is justifiably controversial, and the whole question cries out for illumi- nation, both the means by which the stories have emerged and their con- tent seem to militate against Hy- pothesis 1. Both Hypothesis 2 and Hypothesis 3 remain to be further examined, though neither on the face of it seems adequate to explain all or most of the core data. That there is some unfortunate \"feed- back\" from investigator to subject seems clear even from the author's own anecdotes about follow-up con- versations with the abductees. Often the subjects do seem to be \"en- couraged\" to come up with or elab- orate an abduction scenario. Despite these lapsesâ€”and the author properly labels his own specu- lations as suchâ€”a compelling case is made, and reinforced by the profes- sional opinion of psychologist Aphrodite Clamar, that it could be really happening. Enough parallel and coincidental information has emerged pretty well on its own, world-wide, and without obvious investigator cues to the subjects, to suggest that some real and unex- plained thing has happened to the abductees. Whether it will ultimate- ly prove to be real abductions or some bizarre psychological aberra- tion remains to be seen. In any event, psychologists ought to pay attention and involve themselves in scientific study of abduction reports. Taken for what it is, the author's story of being drawn into the investi- gations and watching the abduction scenarios unfold, the book is a bril- liant one. His own comments on what he has observed and experi- enced are incisive and thought- provoking. The book is well written and totally absorbing. Furthermore, his thesis is highly defensible given what we now knowâ€”or think we knowâ€”about the human mind and hypnosis. Should some other hy- pothesis ultimately prove to be cor- rect; the author cannot be faulted. His is an honest and forthright work that will serve to focus attention on the perplexing subject of abduc- tions, and will help point the way to a resolution.â€” Richard Hall 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Letters \"Close Encounter\" Editor, Neither your limited space nor my limited time allows me to refute the numerous misstatements made by Quentin Fogarty (No. 157, March 1981) in which he purports to re- count what transpired during our meeting. (Both of us made tape re- cordings of our \"Close Encounter.\") Let me cite one example of Fogarty's distortions. He wrote: \"It's the character assassination that I find particularly offensive. In a letter to me, Mass accused Bill Startup (the pilot) of having suicidal tendencies and Geoff Causer (the radar opera- tor) of being derelict in his responsi- bilities.\" Compare Fogarty's claim with what I actually wrote him on March 25, 1980, in response to his request for my views on the New Zealand UFO incident. I first pointed out that the primary responsibility of any traffic controller is to maintain safe separation of an airplane under his control, and to give directions to a pilot facing a potential mid-air colli- sion on the maneuvers he should take to avoid such a conflict. Then I wrote: \"In listening to a tape recording of the communica- tions between the Wellington Center [i.e., Causer] and Capt. Startup, and in studying the transcript [of their radio conversations] I fail to find or detect any evidence of concern or any evidence that Wellington at- tempted to direct Startup out of the seemingly potential conflict situa- tion [with the \"UFO blips\"]. Nor do I detect that Startup was at all con- cerned about the situation. \"One possible explanation for this is that the traffic controller was derelict in his responsibilities and that Startup has suicidal tendencies and has lost all desire to live. Another possible explanation is that the con- troller and Startup were 'playing games' for your benefit, never dream- ing that the incident would mush- room into an internationally famous incident. I am unable to think of any other alternatives.\" 18 Fogarty concludes that my UFO- skepticism stems from a search for \"notoriety\" and he charges I am a \"publicity junkie.\" I achieved inter- national fame more than a quarter of a century ago, thanks to the prestige of Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine. I have appeared on U.S. network television and the TV of Britain, West Germany, and Italy, in connection with my expertise in avionics and \"spy satellites\" as well as high-energy lasers. I will not attempt to assess all of the factors that motivate Fogarty's views on UFOs. But as he has publicly admitted in print, he went to great lengths to financially exploit the film and his experience. I can understand his bitterness at not achieving the financial bonanza he expected, but he ought not put all of the blame on me for his misfortune, including the loss of his job as a reporter for Station O in Australia.â€” Philip J. Klass Washington, D.C. Retrievals Response Editor: In response to Virgil Staff's criti- que of my review of Stringfield's monograph on saucer crashes and retrievals, I have three comments. First, on my doubts concerning U.S. government interest in UFOs, if I must choose between two possibili- ties, that I have \"not read the litera- ture with care\" or that I \"interpret (s) it differently from most Ufologists,\" I will opt for the latter. Second, I am not disturbed about the supposed involvement of junior personnel in retrievals; what disturbs me is that, almost invariably, they are the only ones revealing their in- volvement (and even then, anony- mously). Why no revelations by senior personnel and by scientists? Third, Staff is under a miscon- ception concerning the resources available within \"government agen- cies.\" Many of the specialists needed to study retrieval materials, particu- larly those in the biological sciences, would have to be outside contrac- tors; that is, scientists affiliated with consulting firms, universities, and industry, who would not necessarily feel morally bound â€” and certainly not intellectually bound â€” to the dictates of the contracting govern- ment agency, especially over a long period. What positions, then, are jeopardized? What are the \"penal- ties\" for tenured professors who would love to go down in the history books? I'm not talking about junior individuals who would \"try to ex- pose\" such a secret. I am talking about senior individuals who would expose such a secret, openly, direct- ly, and fully. Why, even the CIA itself cannot control its own people, as evidenced by former agent Philip Agee, who went so far as to publish a trade book revealing government secrets. If Mr. Staff doubts the govern- ment's reliance on outside technical support, then he is' unacquainted with the traditional working struc- ture shared by the federal govern- ment, academia, and industry, which is not like in the movies. In fact, one could ask why the Air Force Aero- space Medical Research Laboratory, located at Wright Patterson Air Force Base â€” right where one would ex- pect the \"little fellows\" to be taken â€” periodically issues requests for pro- posals to anatomists and anthro- pologists to undertake research on human and primate functional mor- phology, research they desperately need to sponsor in support of aero- space medicine studies, but which they have no in-house capability to conduct.

Much of the article centers around the \"landing area\" where Betty claims to have observed and photographed UFOs on many occasions. If you happened across a book with the title, HOW TO BUILD A FLYING SAUCER: AND OTHER PROPOSALS IN SPECULATIVE ENGINEERING, you might be for- given for regarding it with some suspicion. However, there is such a book and its author, T. B. Pawlicki, is not a crackpot. On the contrary, he is a very informative and entertaining writer who has compiled a lot of in- triguing material for this book. Not only does it contain Pawlicki's theories on UFO propulsion (as the title im- plies), but he also discusses such esoterica as time travel, the methods used to build the Pyramids and other megaliths, the possibility of an ancient, world-wide communica- tions network, etc. In one chapter, he goes \"Beyond Velikovsky\" in sug- gesting explanations for a number of solar system mysteries. Granted, much of his material is speculation, but it is informed speculation, which is a far cry from wild guesses. I en- joyed the book very much and cer- tainly recommend it to you.

Ev- eryone in the host organization, Massachusetts MUFON, is to be congratulated for doing a superb job under the leadership of Joe Santan- gelo, the Symposium Chairman. The real key to their success may be attributed to the detailed planning and implementation by the respec- tive committees. The Committee Chairpersons and their areas of res- ponsibility were Joan Thompson, Program; Joe Nyman,Financial; Bob Taylor, Facilities; and Mrs. Merlyn E. Sheehan, Public Relations. The out- standing program was arranged through the efforts of Miss Thomp- son's Program Committee com- posed of Virginia \"Ginny\" Neurath, David Webb, Walter Webb, and Bar- ry Greenwood. With the incomparable Massa- chusetts Institute of Technology as the locale, we are all indebted to Dr. Charles Stark Draper, our M.I.T. Sponsor and Robert Taylor, organi- zational sponsor for making it possi- ble for MUFON to meet at this most prestigious institution. The study of UFOs has reached an era of respect- ability when a gentleman of Dr.Dra- per's stature is willing to be the faculty sponsor at M.I.T. This is in- deed a milestone in elevating the UFO phenomenon from a contro- versial subject to one deserving seri- ous scientific study of what may be termed \"the greatest mystery of our time.\" The September issue of the Jour- nal will contain an illustrated com- mentary of the symposium, for those who were unable to attend.
