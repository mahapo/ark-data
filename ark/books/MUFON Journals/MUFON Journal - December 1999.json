Frison, N.S. Prov. Director A remarkable incident during the summer of 1970 began this author's deep interest in the subject of UFOs. Although the exact day and month of the event cannot be given with absolute certainty, my mother, who was fortunate enough to become the main wit- ness, remembers clearly that she was pregnant with her only daughter at the time. My sister's birth oc- curred in November of 1970, so the year is precise, and the incident took place between 9:30 and 10 p.m. during July or August. The strange unfoldings of that night began as my aunt, Linda M., returned from a small store just up the street from my mother's house in Reserve Mines, Nova Scotia. They both were settling down on the couch to watch a movie. My mother, Joan Frison, noticed a bright light which began to flood in through the windows of the door adjacent to the television set. Thinking it was a car pulling into the driveway and wondering who it could be at that hour, she got up from the couch and went to peer through one of the narrow windows in the door (the center one). To her utter astonishment, with her face up against the glass, she found herself looking into the interior of some type of craft which was positioned no more than five or six feet outside the door. She was look- ing into it at about eye level and was impressed by a sort of countertop that rimmed the interior of the craft, this countertop being level with her face or slightly higher. She also had the impression that she was star- ing through a transparent dome, but was not conscious of the material out of which the dome was constructed, or of its height. My mother relates that she doesn't remember see- ing the dome because it was so close to her and the light which came from inside the craft was so bril- liant that she could not discern glass or any similiar material. She further states, and has done so many times, that she has never seen light of that type any time in her life other than during this event. She says it was \"like fluorescent light, only greater.\" Her de- scription of this light has been provided to me many times, and she always speaks of an intense, brilliant whitish-violet light that she says she just can't de- scribe properly. My mother also says that her impression of the craft's interior was that of an operating room, due to the bright light and how sterile it appeared inside. There was no furniture, no objects that she could make Electrical wires running northward Small tree Barn Wires going to utility pole in front of house X Spot where UFO hovered Shadow of car next to Karl Y.'s house SKETCH S3 Rough drawing clarifying faint detail in photograph (window of house faces directly south) out (and no dust). It was like it was polished clean within, with attention given to perfect cleanliness. She felt at the time it was some sort of control room, but states she could not see any panels or anything-she just had the feeling that she was peering into some type of control room. The countertop that was mentioned earlier seemed to run all around the interior, but she says she couldn't see it on the far side of the craft because the light was so bright, but she knew it was there. She believes the countertop was about the level of where the dome would have been attached to the rest of the craft. Directly in front of her, the countertop seemed to have a rise or mound either on it or just behind it. This mound, a bit further into the sighting, would be- come the focus of her attention. After about a minute of staring into this unusual ob- ject, movement caught her attention. Very slowly, some- thing was starting to rise up from behind the mound. My mother's gaze became fixed to that point, and she watched as a silvery pipe (her words) slowly rose up from behind the mound (or out of it, she wasn't sure) until about four feet of \"pipe\" was exposed above the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 December 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Black sky ''«\\- x I 2' SKETCH #1 What author saw of UFO as it was going over neighbor's house mound. It was about six inches in diameter and had something attached to the top end, making the whole structure remind her of a periscope on a submarine, but not exactly so. It stopped rising, but shortly began to turn from side to side (again like a periscope searching for some- thing) and stopped, facing my mother's face in the window. At that point, she felt the hair stand up on the back of her neck, having the impression she was being watched, and she became very frightened. Quickly, she stepped back from the door. Linda M., noticing her agitation, asked her what was wrong. My mother then replied that she was look- ing at something, but didn't know what it was. Linda M. made her way to the door at this point and saw the craft moving away from where it was in front of the door, heading in the direction of a neighbor's house. This is where I come into the picture, because I am in my bunk bed in the adjacent room and hear the conversation between my mother and my aunt, which prompts me to get out of bed and go to my bedroom window from where this neighbor's house can be observed. I see the craft just skim the roof of this house and disappear behind it. I can't make out any \"body\" to the craft, just the white light shining through the dome and two reddish lights on the side where the body would likely be. Excitement breaks out in our house now and I, along with my brother Blair, who has caught on to the fact that something special is going on, leave the bedroom and go out to join my mother and aunt who are all worked up. The craft couldn't have gone far after I saw it go behind the neighbor's house, because it was spotted almost immediately coming back to- ward the house that we were in, only it is higher up in the sky. Blair Prison and I see it through the sliders at the bottom of the picture window which was hastily opened to observe more clearly the approaching craft. My mother and aunt went outside into the front yard and we all watched this thing circle again and again in tight circles over our heads. My recollection is that it made a number of passes and appeared at this point to be about the size of a dime held at arm's length. I could still see the white light of the dome as well as the red lights, and, I think, a green light, but this last light is fuzzy in my memory. However, I spoke to Blair Prison during the first week of October (1999) and asked him to describe what he recalls of the incident, and the first words he said were \"red and green lights!,\" so my impression of there being a green light must be accu- rate. None of us can remember the number of times it circled, but during the above-mentioned conversation with my brother, he stated that he recalls quite a few passes overhead. While it was circling, my relative, Karl Y., came out onto his step (he was another close neigh- bor) and watched it for quite awhile through his binocu- lars (8 x 40). He reported that he could see it, but didn't have a clue as to what it was. He hadn't seen anything like it before. The entire incident lasted a good twenty minutes be- fore the object just kept going on its last pass and didn't bother to circle again. My mother called CHER radio station in Sydney to report it right after the mysterious craft departed, and we heard on one of the local radio stations the next day that a motorist had witnessed a domed disk fly over his car while on the Sydney-Glace Bay highway. My mother lives along the Sydney-Glace Bay highway, so evidently someone else in the area at the time also saw it independently of us, but we were never able to find out who it was. Another relative of ours, Lawrence M. (no relation to Linda M.), informed us the next day that he had seen it pass in front of his house on its way over to our house. It should be noted that Karl Y. and Lawrence M. were both married adults at the time of this incident and that all four adult witnesses were dead sober as the event was occurring. Also, none of these responsible people were the type who would falsify what they said they saw and, in fact, not one of the witnesses (including the author) had ever given the subject of UFOs much con- sideration before this sighting. Calculating size If one takes a close look at the photograph of my mother's house as it was when this all took place, one will discover certain features that allow conclusions re- garding maximum measurements of the UFO's size. First, the house is a small one, and this is obvious from the fact that the eaves in the front are almost sitting on the header of the door. Although an upstairs and side"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1999 PageS Small  Large tree tree , Mother's house \\ Lawrence M.'s / house Barn Neighbor's house ELI / UFO circles Karl Y.'s house Path of UFO Sydney-Glace Bay highway N porch have long since been added, the door remains the same, and thus accurate measurements are still possible today from ground level to the two insulators fastened to the eaves for the electrical wires coming in from a nearby utility pole. Measurements from ground to the bottom of the door and then of the door itself combine to make a distance of about ten feet to where the two insulators are posi- tioned. With the anomoly positioned almost directly beneath the wires as described by my mother, unless it was not solid matter, it could not have been more than ten feet thick.   , , :t - lf Since the \"pipe\" that rose up from behind the countertop was at least four feet long and seemed to be seamless or looked to not be in telescopic sections, a minimum thickness would be.four feet. Since the \"pipe\" was below the .countertop before it was first seen to be rising, another four feet of thickness can be assumed. The barn in the photograph no longer exists, but dis- tinct markings on the ground identify its exact loca- tion as it was torn down just this year arid the grass has not yet started to grow back. There is a distance of twenty ;feet and five inches from the corner of the barii to the door, so, unless the craft could pass through solid matter, its widest measurement could not have ex- ceeded such a width. My aunt observed it move away through the space between the barn and the house, so we can be certain of this assumption. Many changes have been made to the size of the house since 1970, so it is not certain if the corner closest to the barn is where it was at the time of the incident. Thus, I chose not to rely on mea- surements taken from the comer of the barri to the cor- ner of the house to arrive at the UFO's maximum size and instead opted to measure from bam to door (which has not changed). However, since this measurement is on a slight angle, it should be noted that measurements taken be- tween the corners of both structures would be'a few feet smaller. What can be decided for certain is that this mysterious craft was ho more than ten feet thick and could not havebeen wider than twenty and one-half feet but was probably slightly less than these measure- ments. Speaking to my mother around the end of October, I asked how much room she recalls'within the craft. \"About the size of my present bathroom\" was her re- sponse, which rriakes about eight or ten feet of free space (in diameter) inside. I then asked how much depth"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 December 1999 MUFON UFO Journal from the countertop to the supposed floor of the craft and she said, firmly and without hesitation, \"about four and one-half feet.\" So we can deduce minimum and maximum mea- surements for the craft, but we can't come anywhere near an explanation of what it was. That's where we are almost thirty years later. Perhaps it is interesting to point out that my mother's strongest impressions as she was staring into the craft were of something \"foreign\" and \"alien,\" and that she was immediately struck with the realization that this was not built by human hands. Although only a sub- jective impression, she deeply felt that this thing had nothing to do with human beings. \"Futuristic\" is an- other of the strong impressions that she felt while peer- ing into the interior. While subjective impressions may have no scien- tific weight, I wonder if peering into some sort of ex- perimental craft could invoke such strong feelings in a person or cause the feeling \"that she was about to be hurt by something cold and unfeeling if she didn't step back from the door.\" My mother says that this is what made her step back when the top of the \"pipe\" fixed itself in her direction, but that this reaction was be- cause of the strangeness of the situation and probably didn't represent any real danger. She relates that she has always wished it would return, but it never did. I understand what my mother means about the strangeness of the situation. My own memory is haunted by the unusual nature of the lights that were viewed on the body of the craft. In my forty years of life, I have never experienced lights like them. I can- not, no matter how hard I try, find words that will ex- press their nature. The best I can do is to give a crude analogy which may convey some degree of what experiencing them was like. Imagine that all you experience in your daily life-all of the universe around you-is like a three-dimensional movie and all material objects and the various types of light you experience comes to your senses like an analog signal. But this one object gets sent to you as a digital signal with its better picture quality and richer sound quality. It's like the transmission of this one object or your perception of it has been greatly enhanced. Even the silence of the object appears to be dynamic, almost like the silence is actually emanating from the craft and deadening the normal sounds usually going on in the world around you. We definitely experienced a craft or a vehicle of sorts that night, albeit a highly unusual one. If it was something experimental, then our scientists are work- ing with some unusual laws, because this craft just didn't feel like it belonged in our universe-let alone on this planet. Light from object isolated Planet circling neighboring star reported by astronomers By Dr David Whitehouse BBC News Online Science Editor British astronomers may have detected light from a planet orbiting another star. If so this is the first time this has ever been done and a major achievement. It builds on the extraordinary discoveries of recent years which have revealed Jupi- ter-sized planets orbiting many of the stars nearest to our Sun. Astronomers announced last week they had seen a planet move across the face of a star and dim its light. Now another team has detected the light from a planet. The astronomers, from the Department of As- tronomy at St Andrews University in Scotland, used the William Herschel telescope in the Canary Islands to observe the relatively nearby star Tau Bootes. Tau Bootes is a star that is slightly larger and brighter than our Sun and is 50 light years distant. Bigger than Jupiter It was already known to have a world in orbit around it. In 1996 a team of American astronomers discov- ered a planet orbiting it every 3.3 days. Measurements indicated that it had a mass of almost four times the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. Spurred on by this discovery the St Andrews team decided to look in detail at the spectrum of the star. Hidden in the light from the star, they argued, must be a small amount of reflected light actually from the planet. Their problem was how to extract the planet's light from the starlight that was estimated to be tens of thousands of times brighter. The clue was in knowing the orbit of the planet. With the knowledge that it circled the star every 3.3 days the astronomers were able to look at the spec- trum of the star and extract that portion of the star's light that varied over this timescale. This, they argued, must be the light from the planet. Oxygen reported Although they do not have a picture of the planet, this is the first time that the light from another planet has been isolated. But the astronomers are not yet ready to talk about their discovery. When contacted by BBC News Online they declined to comment or say if their research had yet been submitted to a science journal. In analysing the light from the planet, the research- ers are said to have obtained evidence that the planet's atmosphere is very hot and contains the elements mag- nesium, silicon and oxygen."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1999 Page? Dr. Barry Downing Religion, UFOs, secrecy and policy decisions By Dr. Barry H. Downing As one who explores the relationship between reli- gion and UFOs, let me begin by stating my UFO creed: I believe UFOs are real, and that they carry an intelligent re- ality from another world. I be- lieve our American govern- ment has known of this reality at least since 1947, and has carried on a careful study of what UFOs mean for America, and for human civilization. I believe UFOs have huge implications for religion, and that any American government study of UFOs would include a study of the religious impli- cations of UFOs, and would be part of the overall question: what UFO information do we release, and what do we keep secret? I believe there is a major American UFO study some- where, and in that study would be a chapter entitled \"Religion and American UFO Policy.\" At the same time, it would be difficult to release such a study to the public for at least two reasons: 1) Our Constitutional doctrine of separation of church and state suggests our government should turn such a study over to religious institutions. If our gov- ernment will not allow prayer in schools, what right does it have to make public statements concerning UFOs and religion? 2) At the same time, to turn information concerning UFOs over to religious leaders raises difficult issues: which leaders? Christians and Jews? Christians, Jews and Muslims? Christians, Jews, Muslims and atheists? And if so, who picks the religious leaders, and how do you pick them without taking off the lid of UFO se- crecy? The French study The September 1999 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal carried an article by Gildas Bourdais entitled \"Quasi-official French document looks at defense is- sues related to UFOs.\" I asked Walter Andrus to mail me a copy of the French original, \"Les OVNI et la Defense,\" which he did. I obtained the services of a local professor of French to make a rough translation for me of chapter 13, \"Implications politiqueset religieuses.\" About the Author Dr. Barry Downing has been a MUFON and Fund for UFO Research consultant in theology for many years, is the author of The Bible and Flying Sau- cers, has written numerous articles, and has been a. speaker at MUFON symposia on several occasions. He has been assistant pastor and pastor at Northminster Presbyterian Church in Endwell, NY, for the past 32 years. He joined MUFON in 1974. The French document has been prepared by high level military and scientific leaders in France, the work of a think tank something like the Rand Corporation might produce in America. As the French document has a chapter on \"The Implications for politics and re- ligion,\" I am sure there is an equivalent chapter some- where on \"Religion and American UFO Policy\" in our secret American study. As the French document looks at the issue of UFOs primarily from the point of view of national defense, I am sure America's policy of UFO secrecy began as a national defense issue: if UFOs attack, how can we defend ourselves? Do they have a military purpose? Why are they so interested in our nuclear defense sys- tem? And beyond that there are technological issues: how does UFO technology work, and how can we use it? If Col. Philip Corso is right (The Day After Roswelt) that we recovered a crashed UFO at Roswell, and that Corso farmed pieces of UFO technology to American indus- try to reverse engineer it, then the early UFO years were focused on military and technological issues- plenty of reason to keep UFO secrets. A different situation But we are in a different context now: the Cold War is over, and we seem almost in a hurry to leak or sell our technology to the Chinese or any other buyers. UFO secrecy now serves other purposes-a good excuse to have many large black budget research projects away from the eyes of Congress, and the release of UFO information would have untold religious consequences, which could in turn have major financial and political consequences, and no government wants a financial mess. The French document suggests that America and Britain have had a joint UFO study project going for some time, a reasonable assumption, and a partial ex- planation for the release of the French document. If the French feel they are being left on the outside of the UFO project by the British and Americans, this resent- ment may have led these high level French officials to publish their rather open document. It is interesting that the American media have shown no interest in this French UFO study thus far. I find the American"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS December 1999 MUFON UFO Journal media treatment of UFOs more mysterious than the American government treatment of UFOs. The American Dilemma What might be in the American chapter \"Religion and American UFO Policy?\" Obviously, the answer depends to some extent on facts our government may have that we do not have. But I see two main scenarios, which would make a major difference in the religion chapter. 1) In one scenario, we have established direct con- tact with the aliens, and they have told us their purpose for being here. Maybe they have helped America achieve technological superiority, arid maybe our gov- ernment leaders have discussed religion with them. The main problem in this scenario would be whether or not the aliens can be trusted. 2) In the second scenario, our government does not know much more about UFOs than the average MUFON member, except perhaps for better knowledge of their advanced technology. Even if we have exam- ined dead alien bodies, we may have no idea why they are here, or what they are planning to do-and have done-with the human race. That means the chapter on religion will involve a lot of guessing. Furthermore, our government coverup could not have worked without help from the aliens. If a UFO were to land in the middle of Yankee Stadium during the World Series, even for a minute, and then take off, the se- crecy lid would be off. I believe the aliens know this. I think the second scenario is the more likely; that is I believe the aliens have revealed their presence to us, but not their purpose. I have written previously of \"The Rock of Ages Principle\" (MUFON UFO Journal, May 1990), which argues that the UFO reality, like the Bib- lical divine/angelic reality, keeps a layer of insulation between us and the alien/angelic reality. The American difference In any case, our American study would be quite dif- ferent if we have made direct contact, as opposed to just guessing, looking through a glass darkly. Let us just suppose for the sake of argument that we had di- rect contact with the aliens, that the aliens told our gov- ernment that they had started many religions of the world to direct the development of human culture, and that they placed Jesus on earth. (Something to this ef- fect has already been rumored in UFO circles.) I cannot imagine any American President wanting to make this announcement at a news conference. The chapter on \"Religion and American UFO Policy\" in that case would probably be very brief: keep lying for- ever. If we have not made direct contact, then the Ameri- can chapter on religion might be similar to the French chapter. The French document imagines how we would behave if we were traveling in space, and came to a planet with a primitive culture. \"It seems reasonable to think that our explorers from the Earth will have been charged with the mission of observing these worlds peacefully and/or to conquer, purely and sim- ply, these new lands to settle them.\" (13.1) (I will re- fer to the chapter and section numbers, not the pages, in the French document.) The process would begin with a survey of the planet, and its people, their technology, art, politics and reli- gion. There would be ah attempt to avoid direct con- tact at this early stage. In a technological culture such as ours, we would notice these beings carrying out their study. \"We might think that the psychological and religious impacts will vary according to the dif- ferent types of political organization and the levels of moral and scientific development found in a single world.\" (13.2) Von Daniken revisited? Thus, for instance, when we in our culture see UFOs, we understand that they may be beings from other plan- ets. But in a preindustrial culture, they \"might collec- tively consider these sightings as natural phenomena, or else divine, extraordinary, marvelous, aberrant or diabolical (frescos in the Yugoslav monastery of Detchani, spheres of Nuremberg and Basel in 1551 & 1566).\" (13.2.1) In other words, we need to consider Erich von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods? thesis: if primitive people were to see space beings, they would consider them to be gods. But in our age of space tech- nology, we can see them for what they are-beings from other planets. Thus the French study distinguishes between con- tact with preindustrial civilizations and industrial civi- lizations. In the case of preindustrial, \"It is certain that such contacts will immediately make local populations think they are in the presence of gods.\" (13.4.1) But with industrial civilizations such as our own, \"The day would eventually come when we could believe these civilizations, gradually led by our care to our stage of development, would be ready to participate in our world.\" (13.4.2) Within this scenario, we might expect that the UFO civilization may even now be contacting some gov- ernments of the world to begin integrating us into the UFO civilization. The French study suggests that in the preindustrial phase, several methods might be used to influence these civilizations, including \"elements intended to terrify and impress. Nothing would prevent us from thinking of different episodes in the old Testament.\" (13.3.1) Thus, from the French point of view, the story of the exodus as I describe it in The Bible and Flying"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1999 Page 9 Saucers may be true, and may be part of the process by which UFO culture over the centuries prepared hu- man civilization for this next stage-direct contact and integration with the UFO civilization. There is a broad sense in which the Christian hope of the second coming of Jesus, with the angels, repre- sents religious hope that the heavenly civilization and human civilization will one day be united. Maybe union with the UFO civilization is just around the corner, now that we are \"advanced.\" A methodological flaw But I think there is a major flaw in the French meth- odology, as is also the case in the von Daniken meth- odology-they do not think big enough, especially in terms of time. To apply an anthropological methodol- ogy to UFO civilization is conceptually too limiting. Scientists believe the universe is about 15 billion years old, and our sun is a relatively young star-maybe 5 billion years old. If we suppose that the UFO civili- zation comes from another solar system, maybe even an older galaxy, how far ahead of us might that civili- zation be? A million years? A billion years? We are only now beginning to control our bioge- netic destiny. What would a civilization be like that had been shaping its biogenetic destiny for a million years? What would be the life span of its members? What would be their intelligence and psychic ability? If such beings could read our minds, and influence our dreams, as modern UFO abduction reports seem to indicate, at what point do these beings seem all but supernatural, like the Biblical angels? Then let us suppose that these UFO beings arrive at planet earth not in 1947, not even during the time of Moses, but a million years ago. What if for the UFO civilization \"a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.\" (Psalm 90:4) What if planet Earth is their garden, or farm, or laboratory? Then we might suppose that they are not seeking to integrate UFO culture and human culture. They did not come flying here from somewhere else and dis- cover us. Rather, human culture is their creation. They are in a god-like relation to us. This is what I have called \"The God Hypothesis.\" (MUFON UFO Jour- nal, October 1988). Then we come to the question: what is their purpose for human civilization if we are their creation? We are now very much back to a ques- tion that is at least as religious as scientific. If the Old Testament Exodus is the work of aliens, then the Ten Commandments-Biblical morality-may also be the work of aliens. Why should our morality matter to the aliens, and what happens if our culture stops practic- ing this alien morality? These questions should not be dealt with only by some secret American government study. It is not just contrary to our American Constitution; it is not good for American religious leaders, and the moral role they play in our culture, for them to be doing their work unaware of the huge UFO questions that we face. To say that American religious leaders are \"out of the loop\" when it comes to UFOs is to put it mildly. Pharaoh has lied to us, and religious leaders have barely noticed. As almost everyone understands, Ameri- can culture now faces serious moral issues. We no longer have an agreed-on set of moral values as a na- tion. If our American government were to release its UFO information, I am sure there would be shock. Maybe I would be shocked! But I believe the release of UFO information would lead eventually to an integration of science and religious values in American life-after an early period of stress-and I believe we need that inte- gration. A high tech world with no morals is a very danger- ous place. I believe the aliens know that. Unfortunately, I am not confident those who are writing the chapter on \"Religion and American UFO Policy\" know that. SET! scientists upset by attempts to speed hunt for alien signals Overzealous hackers have tinkered with the software volunteers use to help search for extraterrestrial intel- ligence to make it run faster. But the scientists who run the project say the altered program could be more of a hindrance than a help. \"I don't think people intend to maliciously hurt the SETI program, but we're recommending that people do not use these programs,\" says Dan Werthimer of the University of California at Berkeley, chief scientist on the project. SETI@home is an ambitious attempt to harness the spare power of thousands of computers to search for signals from intelligent life. Scientists break down ob- servations from the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico into 12-second chunks and send them over the Internet to volunteers. Whenever a volunteer's com- puter is idle, the SETI@home program sifts the data for any signals that might have come from an alien civilisation. In October, someone going by the name of Olli re- leased a \"patch\"to the program-an additional section of code that makes the calculations run much faster. At least two other patches have followed.

The base was located approximately 10 miles from the Ohio River along U.S Route 50 southwest of Cincinnati, OH. In private hands today, this base in the mid-1960s was a key installation in the defense of the Greater Cincinnati area from air attack by Soviet air- craft carrying nuclear weap- ons. The base housed Nike- Hercules missiles that could be quickly armed with either high explosive or nuclear war- heads. Our witness was in the U.S. Army working in the Assem- Dr. Irena Scott bly and Test area of the base, assigned to Battery C, 56th Artillery. On the night of this sighting, he was assigned to back-up guard duty. Around 12:30 a.m., a Sergeant Grimes came into the guard office and told our witness and another enlisted man to relieve a guard at Post 4 who had called in and seemed to be \"going crazy.\" When asked why this was happening, Grimes re- plied that there was a UFO over the Assembly and Test area, which was near Post 4. Our witness and the other man left the guard office and proceeded toward Post 4. As they rounded a large pile of dirt more than 20 feet high that was beside a construction area, they saw the UFO in the sky a couple of hundred yards or so away. The disc-shaped UFO was glowing orange/red and appeared to be metallic. The glow pulsated at a fre- quency the witness was not sure of. When this pulsa- tion reached its brightest, the outline of the object was barely visible. Round shapes of what could have been portholes were visible, although the witness pointed out that he could not be sure what these shapes really were. They were lighted in a blue color. From the bottom of the object white \"pieces of light\" came out of the object and moved quickly toward the Editor's Note The is an excerpt from the recently published book, UFOs and the Millennium, by Irena Scott, which contains many newly uncovered cases from the Ohio UFO Notebook and from other credible sources. It covers informants, conspiracies, synchronicities, abductions, colored light beams, Men in Black, Project Blue Book, cover-ups, and Wright Patterson Air Force Base. It is available from Arcturus Books Inc. 1443 S. E. Port St. Lucie Blvd. Port St. Lucie, FL 34952 ground where they disappeared. Only one piece of light came out at a time, the following light not appearing until the previous one had dis- appeared. The light seemed to be going down into the Assem- bly and Test area, although it might have been falling into an area between Assembly and Test and the missile storage facility which was also near Post 4. When asked how big the object was, how far away, or how high, the witness replied that he couldn't say because he had no way to judge. After taking a quick look, Bill Jones both our witness and his com- panion decided they were in danger and neither pro- ceeded on to Post 4. The companion ran back towards the guard office and our witness quickly entered a nearby communications trailer where he proceeded to hear how the base handled the incident. Both of these men were later disciplined for not following on with their orders, although the discipline was not serious. A warrant officer on duty brought up a missile \"topside\" from its underground hanger and prepared it to fire on the aerial intruder. The launcher control fa- cility was about 1800 to 2000 yards away from the base. Permission to fire was requested of that officer all the way up the chain of command, and in each instance the request was denied. The final request was made to NORAD out in Colorado Springs, CO, and the final denial came from there. Since our witness was in the communication facility, he heard all of this on the ra- dio. The response from NORAD included the com- ment that NORAD knew of the object's presence, hav- ing tracked it for some time over the United States. That was all that was said about that subject. Our witness left the trailer after the incident was over. He did not see the UFO leave, and he stated that he did not remember anyone saying how that occurred. If"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1999 Page 11 someone did discuss this, he did not remember it. (Our interview with the witness took place in 1998.) How- ever, he did say that he thought the incident lasted about 10 to 15 minutes. The next day, 7 to 10 officers from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base came to the missile base in two or three automobiles. The witness said that as best he could remember, the group consisted of one \"full bird Colo- nel,\" several lieutenant colonels, and a couple of lower ranking officers. He seemed to remember that two of these officers were from the Army and the rest from the Air Force. They questioned everyone on the base about what they had seen and what they had heard about the inci- dent. When our witness was interviewed he was handed a blank piece of paper and asked to write down every- thing that had happened. He was then questioned by one of the officers. He was asked about the blue color of the portholes, or whatever they were. He was handed a color chart and asked to pick out the color of the blue he had observed. After he chose the proper color, our witness asked his interviewer why he was so interested in the blue color. The interviewer replied that it was because the color blue is associated with nuclear en- ergy. The interviewer also asked our witness if he had seen anyone looking but the portholes. He chuckled and replied that he had not. At the end of the inter- view, our witness was told to never discuss the inci- dent with anyone; \"It did not take place.\" From what his friends later said, apparently everyone on base re- ceived the same order. Not too much was said on base about the incident after that. When we asked if the base had lost any power during this incident, our witness replied in the nega- tive. He had seen no evidence of that, and no one had later said anything that would contradict his observa- tion. Our witness remained assigned to the base until December 1966 when he was transferred to Europe. Additional Comment: This blue color might repre- sent a type of radiation known as Cerenkov Radiation or \"blue glow.\" It is a brilliant blue glow that engulfs a reactor core when it is operating at a high power. Dur- ing high power operation, a reactor core can produce more than 10 to the 15th fissions per second. Each fis- sion produces a tremendous amount of energy, which is partly carried away by fission products that decay to produce high-energy beta particles. These beta particles can be emitted with such high kinetic energy that their velocity can exceed the speed of light in water. When this happens, blue light is emit- ted, and the reactor core will glow blue. Although no particles are known to exceed the speed of light in a vacuum, particles can travel faster than the speed of light in certain mediums, such as water. For example, when a charged beta particle moves through water it can polarize or orient water molecules in a direction adjacent to its path. Thus, it would dis- tort the local electric charge distribution. After the particle has passed, the molecules will return to their original, random charge distribution. Electromagnetic radiation in the form of blue light is emitted as a result of this event. The light has a continuous spectrum unlike the band structure of fluorescent light. At a smaller wavelength, or conversely, a higher frequency, more photons are emitted. Cerenkov radiation in water has peak inten- sity at the extreme blue end of the visible light spec- trum. The blue glow's intensity is directly proportional to the reactor power level and the number of fissions. This property is utilized in Cerenkov detectors that mea- . sure the magnitude of Cerenkov radiation produced in a detector. Cerenkov detectors can be used in mea- surements of other nuclear events. Perhaps this is why the officer was so interested in the blue color. The question about whether anyone was looking out the portholes is also interesting, in view of the amount of radiation that might be accompanied by the blue glow.

She says she had the feeling that she should look up, and when she did she saw a diamond-shaped ob- ject traveling over their vehicle in a southeasterly direction. L said that her entire family exited the ve- hicle and watched the object change directions to a north to south direction. As the family attempted to follow the object, it suddenly \"rotated\" to almost a rectangle shape, then sped off towards the McDowell mountains to the southeast. From their vehicle, they watched the ob- ject move towards the McDowell mountain range and disappear after moving over the top of the moun- tain. L explained that the object reminded her of an \"upside-down dinner plate\" with a green, \"dash- board- type light\" coming from each light positioned at the corner of the diamond. She went on to explain that there was no sound at all coming from this object, but that it moved like an airplane would. L stated that the object was the size of a normal-sized car, and that it was about 1,000 feet in elevation when it passed over the top of their vehicle, but then climbed higher when she lost sight of it over the McDowell mountain range. She said that she was very excited to see this ob- ject, but was not frightened in the least, and that her daughter was very excited also. (Her daughter agreed to cooperate with the investigation, but after mul- tiple attempts to interview her, she now chooses not to be interviewed. It was recently revealed that she is undergoing treatment for a serious illness.)

Her husband's sketch from D's mother-in-law's home from a visit when he noticed a solid, pale light approaching their ve- hicle from the northwest at about 120 to 150 knots in velocity and situated about 1000 feet in elevation. D's vehicle was traveling north on Shea Blvd. at 54th street in North Scottsdale when this incident took place. As the light came closer to the vehicle, he then realized that the object was in a diamond shape con- figuration with four lights situated in the point of each diamond. D described the object as about as large as a four-engine jet plane, and said it was trav- eling in a south-easterly direction. When the object flew over the vehicle it suddenly, and slightly, changed position to due east, and then resembled a \"flying box,\" as it moved away. D and his family then pulled their vehicle over to the side of the road as they watched the object pass by. He said that he could not see the top or sides of this object. It was then decided that they would get back in their vehicle and attempt to follow the ob- ject that was now moving due east. They all felt as though they had seen something \" special.\" Later, his daughter explained that she briefly saw a dark structure located at the top of the diamond that was not connected to the diamond shape, but was moving in unison with the object as it passed. D attempted to follow the object as he drove to"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal December 1999 Page 13 56th Street. The object then made an abrupt change of direction to north and then south in a \"weaving\" type motion. The object then changed direction again to the northeast towards the McDowell mountain range, climbed in elevation at a slightly higher speed, then disappeared over the top of the McDowell mountains. The duration of this event lasted 6 min- utes. D later described the under-belly of the craft as having an intersecting line from each diamond point to the center of the bottom, which was concave in appearance, (see wax paper diagram) Dan is in good health, but has a slight asthma con- dition and takes the medication \"asthma court\" for his condition.

One of his favorite hobbies is to watch the aircraft take off and land from Scottsdale Airpark, which is located very close to his residence. Preliminary evaluation of a UFO report Case report log number: AZ99010 field investigator: Jim Kelly date report submitted: 10/23/99 case report reviewer: Bob Sylvester, State Director, MUFON Arizona date case report reviewed: 11/03/99 Case report review conclusions: Case report AZ99010 is approved for transmit- tal to MUFON Deputy Director, Investigations. 1. All appropriate sighting forms are completely filled out and included. Witnesses interviewed sepa- rately on tape. 2. Witnesses' personal accounts agree on the fol- lowing points: a) Anomalous object seen flying in sky (4 lights attached to a diamond-shaped object) at an estimated 1000 ft. Husband and wife agreed that underside of object appeared concave. b) No sound could be heard emitting from the object; witnesses thought sound should have been noticeable at 1,000 feet elevation. c) Sighting lasted six minutes. Object tracked from northwest to southeast, and then turned to the east and flew out of sight over nearby mountains. d) Witnesses strongly felt object was not an air- craft. 3. Witnesses' personal accounts disagree on fol- lowing points: a) Wife and daughter said lights were solid pale green; husband is color blind, and'to him the lights looked a creamy, white color. b) Husband saw lines from each corner of the diamond intersecting in the bottom center of the ob- ject; wife did not see the intersecting lines. c) Husband said the size of the object was that of a 4-engine jet plane; wife stated she thought the object was the size of a normal-sized car. d) Husband says that as the object moved away, it seemed to have a box shape; wife does not men- tion the same change in shape. e) Husband says the object was as bright as the moon; wife says it was as bright as a star. 4. Investigator's report clarifies disagreement in lights color as being due to the husband being color blind;, daughter and mother saw green, husband saw white. 5. There appears to be sufficient evidence to conclude that the witnesses did not appear to be sus- ceptible to fantasies, exaggeration, or outright dis- honesty. One should note on page 3 of the computer input form that the husband subsequently reported that he and his daughter both had dreams that the object flew over their house on the same evening. Phoenix FAA was contacted, and Dave Cosgrove informed investigator that there were no complaints or sightings reported by pilots. Scottsdale Airpark PIO Officer Dave Schrier was contacted, and he reported no sightings or complaints by pilots. (D reported that there were at least two other small airplanes in the area at the time of the sighting, however, the Air Traffic Control tower for the airpark closes at 9 p.m. each evening, and the sighting was at 10:20 p.m.) NOAS maps were examined. Luke Air Force Base PIO Margie May was con- tacted and said that Luke does not fly in that_area. 9. Meteorological and astronomical data fbr\\the evening in question was consulted. Two witness drawings are attached to this report, well as an aeronautical map of the area showing tto apparent flight path. The path of the object was in flight vector, or corridor, of Deer Valley Airpor<lo- cated just northwest of Phoenix. This airport is mainly used by smaller non-commercial planes. It is also a holding place for antique or vintage aircraft.

V-W, rt - r \" \"'*— -S-.- • A name change? Gentlemen: Having been involved with the ET Phenomena for many years and a MUFON field investigator for over fifteen years, I feel justified to offer some suggestions. The term UFO is not regarded by the scientific com- munity and the general public with much credibility. As we all know, our government has treated the sub- ject with an overabundance of ridicule. The propa- ganda machinery is as effective today as it was in 1947. I suggest that we bring all of the powers that we have at our disposal to bring dignity and respect to the ET question. We could start by changing the title UFO (MUFON) to a more dignified title. Here are a few suggestions: 1. Extra Terrestrial Research Organization (ETRO) 2. International Inter-planetary Society (IIS) 3. Inter-planetary Galatic Society (IPGS) 4. Outer Space Research Organization (OSRO) 5. Bureau of Outer Space Contact Organization (BOSC) These are a few ideas, and I am sure we could get our collective minds together and come up with a suit- able title. I consider the problem up to now has been that the public at large, govenmental agencies, and the scientific community will never give serious consid- eration to our effort as long as UFO is part of our title. For too long, the term UFO has been regarded'with scorn, the subject of jokes, and ridicule. I know, as I have been a serious ET researcher and participant since 1958 and have been subjected to considerable abuse. I am sure that the cost of changing our title, rewrit- ing the charter, and all of the associated changes an organization goes through would be expensive and la- borious. The membership could be asked to voluntar- ily contribute a small sum to help offset the cost. Naturally, there will be opposition as many fear loss of identity, which would be a real concern. This could be overcome by a simple questionnaire to the mem- bership and upon majority approval (if so indicated), a gradual transition from the old title to the new could be implemented. In my opinion, we will never gain respectability and support from our friends, neighbors, and professionals in our current status. I depend upon history to prove my point. C. Joseph Barron Gulf Breeze/Pensacola MUFON Field Investigator Lubbock photo Dear Mr. Connelly: Without a detailed description of the original pic- ture, it's difficult to make a judgement about Donald Burleson's claim of a honeycomb structure in the Lub- bock Light picture, published on page 12 of the Octo- ber issue. It seems to me that one can detect a \"sided\" pattern to the outside of the image, itself, suggestive of an out- of-focus image produced by the iris of a camera or dark- room enlarger. Is the published image from the original negative, a copy negative, an nth generation print, a printed page, a video image, or what? What equipment was used to take the picture, copy the picture, etc? What magnifi- cations were used in the duplications? Three possible explanations come to mind for the sort of pattern seen within the image presented in the article. 1) a greatly magnified image of the printer's \"dot\" pattern of a printed picture; 2) a greatly magni- fied image of the silver grains of a photographic nega- tive or photographic paper, 3) a Schlieren Pattern of moving turbulence cells in the atmosphere when an optical system, such as a tele- scope, is racked beyond its focus. It is likely that what we are seeing at such great magnifications are simply artifacts of the imaging sys- tems used in the several generations of this picture. But, the truth is, that without even basic informa- tion about the medium in which this image appears, speculation about the image such as that offered by Donald Burelson is simply a waste of time.

The proposed proclamation's full text reads: \"Be it enacted by the people of the state of Mis- souri that the year 2000 be proclaimed and observed as the Year of UFO Awareness. Because of the fed- eral government's failure to be officially forthcom- ing about Unidentified Flying Objects, the public re- mains ill-informed and confused on a matter of po- tentially great consequence. We therefore urge the U.S. Congress to expeditiously convene open, com- prehensive hearings in which government person- nel (military, civilian-contract, and agency employ- ees-active and retired) are permitted to present sworn testimony regarding their personal knowledge of any UFO-related evidence, to be given under immunity by waiver of any applicable security oath or agree- ment of nondisclosure. This proclamation acknowl- edges the following facts: (1) the weight of the cu- mulative evidence-e.g., eyewitness, electronic-detec- tion, photographic, documentary-overwhelmingly supports the conclusion of a majority of Americans that some of the reported UFOs represent somebody else's spacecraft; (2) the federal government's han- dling of the UFO issue has contributed to the public cynicism toward, and general mistrust of, govern- ment-a development injurious to our republic; (3) this initial year of the third millennium affords us a renewed opportunity to explore, assess, and convey every facet of UFO reality.\" Widaman expects his group to start collecting sig- natures from supportive registered voters as soon as the petition's language gets certified by the state sec- retary.

The authors state that \"observ- ing one thing and the photographic evidence showing something else remains a mystery.\" No control experiments were shown, which might determine if air- planes show the changing pattern of bright spots seen in the photos. I performed a control experiment by videotaping a Northwest Air- lines (judging by the trademark red tail) flying over my home. A contrail was evident; with higher air temperature, lower altitude, or a prop plane, a contrail would easily be absent. The video easily showed the morphing pattern of bright spots found in the article. The images shown first show no bright spots, then three dim spots, two spots (a \"peanut\" shape, similar to that shown on the January '99 MUFON UFO Journal cover, easily created by the wings' reflection interrupted by the plane body or vice versa), a bright spot near the tail, then a cross shape. Significant morphs easily occurred in under a second. The Northwest flight is not destined for another dimension; it is merely reflecting sunlight off windows, wings, ailerons, or whatever. Movement of the ailerons or buffeted wings will quickly change the reflections. The control experiment shows that the \"morphing\" bright spots can be explained by airplane sun-reflections on a cloudless day, as the witnesses describe. No other dimensions or shape-shifting are re- quired. British passenger jet has near miss The London Daily Mail of Oct. 26, 1999, reported that a passenger jet's close encounter with a mysterious, fast moving craft seconds after taking off from Heathrow (London) had experts baffled. The crew of an MD-81 reported an object 'Mike a bright light\" passing within 20 feet of them at 3,500 feet. Air accident investigators were unable to shed any light (pun?) on the mystery as radar records show there were no other planes in the area at the time. A dossier on last month's incident is thought to have been passed to the MoD (Ministry of Defence) to see if the UFO could have been a radar-invisible foreign spy plane or stray British test craft.

The witness stated, \"I have seen these triangle aircraft several times. I was just walking home in the woods behind where I live from scouting deer for the upcoming hunting season. It was getting pretty dark, so I was in a hurry and got tired walking up the final hill. \"I stopped to take a quick breather at 7:30 p.m. when all of a sudden one, then two, three, and then four fly- ing triangle craft went right by me in the bottom of the small valley. They were totally silent and appeared to be sneaking through the valley. \"They were triangular in shape and about 75 feet long and as wide. There were no outside lights, but being so close to them I could tell there was lighting inside. I was scared! \"All of a sudden three large noisy planes came screaming by as if they were chasing the triangles. This is the second night I've seen the^e craft.

Morgan Clements Director, World Wide UFO Re- porting Center Triangle craft near Gulf Breeze PENSACOLA BEACH - On Oct. 9, 1999, the wit- nesses were Red fishing in Pensacola Pass when a strangely configured craft came into view over Fort Pickens State Park at an altitude of 200 feet at a quar- ter of a mile. The witnesses are an ex-USAF security policeman and a retired US Army chopper pilot pres- ently a city police officer. The UFO was traveling west over the Gulf of Mexico in a Zig Zag fashion at 7:57 p.m The craft flew slow 100 to 300 knots, sliding south and back to north in a continuing forward motion. The craft moved in a Z pattern erratic with no sound. It seemed to be suspended in flight at various positions. The craft was silent with high intensity blue arcing lights that fluctuated around the entire craft. These lights resembled electrical charges coming off an alternator's brushes. Further observation revealed three larger lights in a triangle configuration dimly lit with variable output glowing blue to pale yellow. The UFO appeared tri- angular in shape, but this might be a deception as skin structure could not be seen. The FM radio receiver suffered extreme static during the event. The craft changed locations in split seconds cover- ing distances of approximately half a mile to over two miles instantaneously. At least four times it hovered for 30 seconds, with the longest delay about a minute and a half over the southwestern boundary of Pensacola Naval Air Station. One aircraft was launched from Sherman Field about three minutes into the event, but seemed unaware of the UFO and turned away in an easterly direction. When the UFO was first observed a trailing sound of a helicopter could be heard, but never could be observed. The UFO left the area after fifteen minutes at 8:12 p.m. local time, moving west along the coast. One witness suffered from nausea for about 10 minutes, but the other was fine. \"I have never seen a conventional craft op- erate in this manner, nor has my friend.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFO Reporting Center. New Jersey video KEASBEY — Reverend Damian Barna called to inform me he had shot eight minutes of an extraordi- nary UFO video in broad daylight on Nov. 11, 1999, over Middlesex County only fifteen miles from New York City. The video tape shows several different shaped UFOs. One is the standard disc shape. The primary ones are two-cylinder or rod-shaped craft. As the cylinder moves slowly through the sky it appears to be covered"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 December 1999 MUFON UFO Journal in a thin vapor. Although it is difficult to estimate length, the craft appears on the video as at least a hun- dred feet long. It sends out a thin line forward an estimated 600 feet, or about six inches at arm's length. Somehow the object seems to morph or move along the tube to the second position. The movement is clear and dis- tinct and may be some sort of cloaking device. I have never seen an object move in this manner. It seems to gradually disappear in one spot and gradu- ally appears as the same size and shape in another. The tape is copyrighted and will be placed on our web site in a week or so. The video was taken at 4:50 p.m. over Rantan Center. This is an extraordinary tape of very strange UFO activity. Thanks to Reverend Barna, who feels the craft were made visible to him for im- portant religious reasons that may portend great changes. Triangle with orange lights MAT AW AN — On Nov. 6,1999,6:03 p.m. an un- believably large flying triangular-shaped craft was observed with pale orange colored non-blinking lights. Three friends were just settling into the Jacuzzi when one friend noticed something and pointed upward. They saw a large flying triangular craft going over- head at an extremely low speed. There was no sound. It was headed in a southwest- em direction and seemed to be flying in a vapor like cloud. My friend there with me is former Air Force and said it did not follow protocol with it's lights All we could say was \"Oh my Godf\" I can't shake the im- age from my mind. Thanks to Peter Davenport UFORC http:// www.UFOcenter.com North Carolina light ASHEVILLE - An executive recruiter phoned to tell me he had witnessed an object west of town on Oct. 24,1999. It was about 5:30 p.m. when he and his wife witnessed a hovering bright orange halogen-like light in the sky. As their car moved along, it disap- peared behind the trees. Although it was still daylight, the craft appeared as bright as motorcycle light at night a hundred feet away. They could not see a definitive shape. A couple weeks of later, on Nov. 12, they boih saw a silvery disc-shaped object that had Mrangt- erratic movements in the sky. A relative who works for Air Pollution Control Agency saw a greenish fireball fall from the sky on Nov. 1, 1999. Colorado video CANNON CITY — Christopher O'Brien reports a woman evidently was able to capture several aerial anomalies on video as they hovered over the Penrose, CO area. The video is 20 minutes long, and a tripod was used during filming. Interestingly, in one seg- ment \"the two objects for 8 or 9 frames appear to have a connecting beam between them.\" One object has the appearance \"of a children's top with spokes\" ex- tending out from the object. Mexico green flying triangle MONTERREY<OnNov. 14,1999, a green Flying Triangle was spotted over downtown Monterrey at 6:30 p.m. Manuel Hernandez, age 35, of Monterrey, claims to have witnessed a UFO. He had been watching the night sky for several weeks and spotted four UFOs. The biggest had a triangle form and also has bright green lights The location of this UFO was near the Saddle Hill. The other UFOs had a saucer shape with flashing red and blue lights. Thanks to World Wide UFO Reporting Center http://www.ufosightings.net. Hovering UFO in Sicily ADRANO — On Oct. 23, 1999, around noontime, a luminous hovering UFO was sighted above the sum- mit of Mount Etna performing small maneuvers, for ten minutes. The oval-shaped UFO was seen by hun- dreds of people in the city of Adrano, southwest of the volcano. The UFO was described as \"a white circular object with a dark central mass that appeared scorched. The object changed its position vertically, horizon- tally and frontally and also its shape.\" In Adrano, a movie house owner and a TV newsman videotaped the object for several minutes and described it as a disco volante.

Pig reportedly abducted in view of 50 Brazilians Peasants from Sena Madureira in the Brazilian State of Acre stated that they watched the abduction of a pig by a UFO. According to the witnesses, a bright light shaped like a VW Beetle automobile hovered over the town about 10 p.m. on July 12. The pig's lift was wit- nessed by more than 50 people, according to Lt .Wesley Rocha, PM commander of the town. \"It may have been another thing,\" he said. \"People think they have seen a flying saucer, but these are re- ports from serious people.\" UFOs have been reported over towns in the State of Acre in the past two months. Another UFO was reportedly filmed by a local TV team and then shown on TV. Lt. Rocha said that other cases have occurred in the region, including a CE-1 on the Rio Branco-Sena Madureira road. Alberto Francisco do Carmo, a veteran researcher in Brazil and the source for the above report, was con- tacted by the Journal to see if he had additional infor- mation. He replied, \"Well, Probably you have the text I trans- lated from the Jornal da Tarde ( Sao Paulo-SP), an evening paper that belongs to the O Estado de Sao Paulo, perhaps the most traditional newspaper in Sao Paulo. So it's not a tabloid source. \"When I read this I got the telephone number of the Acre State Military Police in Sena Madureira, a town that is near Rio Branco the capital of the Acre State. By the way, when I say \"military police\" it's not like your army's MR It's a state corporation somewhat simi- lar to your National Guard. \"Well, back to the main subject. I got to talk to Lieu- tenant Wesley Rocha, and he confirmed the story and told me that other sightings had happened, especially a CE1 on a road that links Sena Madureira to Rio Branco. \"Then I repeatedly called him, but either he wasn't there or had traveled to Rio Branco, or-perhaps-was avoiding me. Then in a good will gesture I sent a letter to him with some gifts, including articles about the role of military personalities that were involved in UFO sightings and investigations in the past in Brazil. 'Then things-unfortunately-went hot in Acre, for it was discovered that a state congrebsman-the second in terms of votes in the state-was running a gangster- like group that killed many people and was involved top to the bottom with drug traffic. And in a domino effect many people were arrested. Another criminal link was discovered with people in Maranhao, and people from the Military Police were caught and ar- rested and transferred to Brasilia; in short, a real mess. \"With such a situation, I thought it wasn't advisable to insist too much.\" Thus far there has apparently been no on-site inves- tigation of this case by ufology researchers. There are other known cases involving the appar- ent \"abduction\" of animals. One such case, also from Brazil, took place in Mato Grosso State in the 1980s when a horse was reportedly lifted into the air by a large unidentified flying object. \"The horse could be seen 'flying' from a long distance while it was being dragged up into that disc shaped UFO,\" according to Brazilian ufologist Vitorio Pacaccini. Researcher Linda Moulton Howe has also reported cases of animals being lifted by UFOs. In her book Glympses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strange- ness, she quotes Timothy Flint, a Certified Medical Assistant from Portland, OR, as follows: \"All of a sudden, this light beam came down from the blue base of a round, lighted object in the sky, a kind of milky white light that I could see right through. And it came down and surrounded the cow, and the cow started to levitate. The cow went stiffand its head popped up and its eyes were wide open and its tongue was sticking out. And it went up.\" Flint reportedly observed this during his own abduction experience, which puts this report in a special category. Journal readers will, however, recall the case of the apparent abduction of an elk by a UFO in broad day- light Feb. 25,1999, in Washington state. As reported in the July 1999 MUFON UFO Journal, the elk ab- duction was witnessed by three members of a crew of Hispanic forestry workers. An investigation by Rob- ert Fairfax, Ruben Uriarte, Peter Davenport, and Kathleen Anderson revealed no reason to disbelieve the testimony of the workers. Filer's Files...

The people of the remote Bainingo ranges say the craft had huge lumps on the sides with light flickering around it. Some Bainingos said the object was lit up all around like a red-hot stone in an oven pit. They saw exactly what others on the Gazelle Peninsula witnessed on Nov. 4, 1999."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 20 December 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Perspective On the November MUFON UFO Journal By Richard H. Hall Would you believe...eclectic? That is the best word I could think of to describe the contents of the Novem- ber issue, which includes a detailed abduction report, a theoretical UFO detection technique involving radio waves, a profile of contactee Elizabeth Klarer, and a report of a newly discovered planet beyond Pluto, among other news. Richard Hall And now for some nitpick- ing. Paul Miller obviously is trying to be thorough and ob- jective, and cites scholarly ref- erences for many of his state- ments about the \"Vicki Hoyle\" abduction. Good! Abduction case investiga- tions are exceedingly difficult and fraught with pitfalls, so I don't mean to second-guess anything. However, investigators have to be especially careful in these cases so I offer a little feedback. The statement, \"Her age at the time of the sighting corresponds to the age when many reportedly enter the breeding program\" cries out for explanation. It should have been referenced; otherwise it sounds like a ma- jor, questionable preconception about \"what is really going on.\" Also, it is a very questionable technique to discuss with an abductee or his/her family what you are think- ing or discovering about their case in comparison to others. (See my Fund for UFO Research paper titled \"Testing Reality.\") In a given set of circumstances it may be entirely harmless, but for reasons explained in my paper it can sometimes do psychological harm, especially when it is seen by them to confirm that something abnormal is really happening, and they are not properly prepared to deal with this new reality. I will leave the concept of meteor-scatter communi- cations technology to people with the appropriate ex- pertise, but I do know that meteor watchers use radio set-ups to listen for the \"hiss\" of meteors. It seems en- tirely plausible that UFOs may have a characteristic radio signal due to ionization, but if ever there was a serious \"signal\" to \"noise\" ratio problem, this would seem to be it. Still, it is an interesting concept worth further discussion. I have great respect for Cynthia Hind, and read her anecdote about Elizabeth Klarer with interest. I agree that contactees can be quite \"sincere\"; they also almost certainly are self-deluded, and their attempts at explaining what has happened to them are pretty far-fetched and unbelievable. There could be some core reality to her claims of liaison with a spaceman, but her story is so overladen with New-Age-style wishful thinking and fantasy that it would be nearly impossible to figure it out, unless other clearer-thinking witnesses can be found. But, there still is a major difference between the typical contactee story and the typical abductee story. The former is voluntarily up close and personal with noble space beings. The latter is involuntarily kid- napped, restrained, tampered with, submitted to pain- ful procedures, and has their memory impaired, with resulting psychological problems. I said \"typical\"; there are some exceptions. I'm sorry to see Zecharia Sitchin taken seriously about anything, as CNI News does in its \"Huge Planet Beyond Pluto?\" story. He is V.D. (Von Daniken) re- visited and apparently highly contagious. Ask any reputable antiquities or archeoastronomy scholar about him. Imagination and pretentiousness is not scholar- ship, and it certainly is not science, and I have never seen anything quite so pretentious as his claims to know the history of the universe. As I write these words, the annual Leonid meteor shower is getting underway, and on Nov. ] 6 there was a humdinger of a fireball seen from Canada to Texas and through the Central U.S. a little after 7:00 p.m. EST. Apparently it was a random fireball not associ- ated with the Leonids, possibly an asteroid fragment, and resembling a \"fireball train\" (a succession of fire- balls one after the other). At last report, there was no satellite re-entry at that time.

A line through the Hunter's three belt stars points left toward the night's brightest star, Sinus. A similar line through the belt to the right aims at the fiery eye of the Bull Taurus, the star Aldebaran. Note the tiny dipper-shaped star cluster in the Bull's shoulder, the Pleiades—a beautiful sight whether viewed with the naked eye or with optical magnification. Orion itself is surrounded by the Winter Circle of bright stars, each one residing in its own constellation. Don't forget to check out the hazy patch of light in Orion's sword, which is suspended from the Hunter's belt. This famous Orion Nebula is one of the most stud- ied objects in the entire sky. It is a cloud of glowing gas and dust where new stars even now are being born. Binoculars and telescopes reveal the nebula's true ethe- real beauty.

Funds Needed for MUFON UFO Museum In 1994, when the Bigelow Foundation was provid- ing financial help to all three members of the UFO Research Coalition, MUFON obligated itself to ini- tiate specific new programs that we could not have financed otherwise. One of these was the MUFON UFO INFORMATION CENTER AND MUSEUM located in an office complex on the main north-south highway Bypass 123 through Seguin,.TX. This is a separate facility only a few blocks from MUFON's business office at 103 Oldtowne Road. The fundamental purpose of the \"UFO Information Center\" was public education for the general public and media, as well as UFO enthusiasts. It is the only UFO museum in the United States east of Roswell, NM. MUFON members from coast to coast and bor- der to border have visited the museum, including visi- tors from eight different countries. We do not charge admission, but solicit donations only. Obviously, the donations do not cover the monthly rent of $350 for the 500-square-foot facility. After the museum was assembled in 1994, Bob Bigclow abruptly withdrew his financial support in July 1995, leaving MUFON with an additional expenditure that exceeds our annual budget. Over the years MUFON has received donations that are I.R.S. tax deductible for the donor in their annual income tax report. These gifts are very much appreci- ated, however, they are far from adequate 10 cover the annual rent of $4200 for the museum This is the sec- ond time that we have solicited funds for this project, because the need still exists. Since income tax time is approaching, this is an opportune time to secure a tax deduction on your 1999 return. We thank those who were so thoughtful last year. Those of you who have visited our museum recog- nize its importance and the unique displays. We have had photographs in the MUFON UFO Journal for those of you who haven't had the privilege of seeing this one-of-a-kind display. The MUFON office acknowl- edges all donations or gifts of any size with a letter that you can attach to your income tax statement. If you want to see our UFO Information Center and Museum continue to share its displays, exhibits, and photographs with people interested in learning more about the UFO phenomenon, this is your opportunity to step forward and make a generous gift consistent with your financial status.
