Helater described to us in broadhighland dialect what he saw.\"Well, tellya, I came out andsuddenly I saw it...up there (ele-vation 13/15 degrees) betweenthose trees (see sketch). And itmoved to the right, the stuff, andgot hands—first three upwards,then two long ones downwards...at a glance. Funny show, I thought,huh.\" A sketch prepared by thewitness, who is fond of drawing,shows the most bizarre shape wehave ever come across in our Aus-trian investigations: A round bodywith a cornflowerblue rim meltinginto a yellow center and around itfive hand-like projections with blue,celadon (grayish yellow-green-Ed.)and yellow sections, in apeculiararrangement like a colorful \"skyclock.\"(Uncle Pritz, an artist, pointedout the colors on a color chart. Hesaid the entire object appeared flat.Reconstructing the scene, Bergerobtained measurements of about50 min for the . round object,2 degrees 10 minutes for the upper\"hands,\" and 3 degrees 40minutesfor a lower \"hand.\" Somethinglike thin thread filled the gaps be-tween the \"hands.\"—Ed.)Seconds.after the hands appear-ed, Uncle Pritz continued, \"thewhole gadget thundered donw withits hands, at a twitch, and wasgone. Switched off, call it what youwant. I noticed a dark shape inthe place (the object had left), likethe new moon or a dark some-thin' behind a curtain.\" (For 15minutes therafter, Pritz watchedsome star-like objects apparentlycavorting up and down and side-ways. A pattern of three star-likelights between 7 and 8 o'clock, thelargest at the top. and the smallertwo forming the base of a triangle,has been seen repeatedly by Josefand Hans Pritz.—Ed.)On the clear evening of January13, 1975 at 7:40 p.m., Uncle Pritzstepped out of the front door of hishouse. \"Now, I said, what's that?That star was standing up .there.(Josef Pritz always called the ob-jects \"stars\" regardless of theirsize-E.B.)Suddenly it had two clock handswith a blue sparkle, no red edgesthis time, and I read: nine o'clock.\"The motionless object had a yellowcenter and a blue edge again, butthe \"clock hands\" were a uniformbluish color, a long one upwards,a short one to the left forming the\"nine o'clock\" position. \"Thehands shone like the star,\" UnclePritz said, \"and (downwards) therewere two transparent hands, yousee, not filled up, only yellowish-green.\" Thin rays or \"thread\"again filled the gaps between thehands: The small \"hour hand\"changed back and forth from leftto right to left, between the 9 and3 o'clock positions. The hands werevisible for about a minute, thenvanished.\"Well, seems they needed nohands for the next round.(UnclePritz grinned). The star stood stil},and you'd see clearly somethingpushed out, like a two meter can-non barrel, or a big car exhaustpipe. Said to myself: Hey, what'sthe matter now? ARe they goin' toshoot?\" (Pritz was a soldier inWorld War II for four years). Hepointed at brown in our color table,but added that there was no il-lumination to the shape which cameout quickly from the lower right,pointing towards the woods atabout 45 degrees. ''Would say thebarrel was even longer than thestar. And they didn't give me achance to stop wonderin'. A longtrail of sparks, .a real burst of fire,spurted out of the barrel. I thoughtBoy, they're shooting! Take coveror you'll be killed! Flung myselfright there (in the corner behind thefront porch). The sparks flew pret-ty far.\"The scene, as described by JosefPritz, was a stationary thing ofroughly full moon diameter shoot-ing out a sloping stream of parallel-flying, long sparks down into theWachtstein woods, \"like glowingnails, blood red, falling like bundlesof sparks from a locomotive...no"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SOME STRUCTURED OBJECTS SEEN IN THE.TRAUNSTEIN AREA(August 1973 through March 1975)^O>M«r/Apr'Bw. ,clockDeeJa h 75' N 3/ \\ *6-— -63Gross We.{**«Hi<c*k Mar\\\\\\l////h. ^  ^^. x\"Q ; *Q'-*^ *,**? * \"lArtJUl,Jf"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"sound, the thing was silenceitself.\" The sparks seemed to burnout in flight; the \"target\" was at320/325 azimuth, behind two oldconifers, which were not affectedor illuminated.

The upper object, exactlyin the place where the first \"Clock\"had appeared, was in motion. HansPritz, who used his binocularsthroughout, provided us with thebest technical description of a\"classical dogfight\" we have inour records so far. \"The big(upper) one would go left and right(horizontally), then up and down(vertically), then do a circle (clock-wise),\" he said. \"One time I evensaw it approach us in kind ofa slalom race motion, wiggling, anddraw back qucikly...And besidesyou's see it move along within thenext half hour more than a starwould do.\" (More details of themotions, collectively moving to theright very gradually, and the posi-tions follows-Ed.)   \":Hans Pritz, his fiance and somefriends, left Traunstein headed forZwettl in Pritz's Renault about7:45 p.m. March 1, 1975. About8:00 p.m. they reached B-36 atGrafenschlag. At a bend beforeentering Gross Weissenbach anobject caught Pritz's eye. (It waspossible for me to drive the samestretch with Hans before comple-ion of this report). \"It looked likeit was over or behind the wood tothe left, a red spot, but not only aspot, it had a certain shape, likea dirigible...it was red, a fiery redglow of an oblong body.'' We inter-rupted with the color table. \"Can'tfind the red color, only carminewould fit it...Do you know how thesun looks at sunset, red?...allthe landscape around it was bathedwith light.\"(Pritz started to slow the car, buthis companions urged him to con-tinue, insisting it was only a fire.A later check revealed no fire inthe area. To the right of the el-liptical object Pritz saw threeevenly-spaced spheres about1 degree apart, gleaming yellowand seemingly segmented intomany parts like a jig-saw puzzle,and at least half the size of thefull moon. He didn't point theseout to his passengers, but drove onand saw the ellipse again fromanother angle. A triangulationbased on the two observation pointsgave a size of 50 meters by 10-12meters for the ellipse fro a distanceof 900 meters; assuming the samedistance for the spheres gave thema diameter of 5 meters.-Ed.)1977MUFONSYMPOSIUMPROCEEDINGS(166 pages)UFOs: WHAT'S YOUR BALL GAME? byThomas M.

The factthat I did not react with fear tosuch knowledge should disproveHall's intimations ot paranoia onmy part. Hall's reference to myomitting a sentence from his letter(June 25,1964) regarding Frankel'sprior connection with governmentUFO analysis is a non sequitur.That played no part in my agreeingto use Goddard and Frankel forthe analysis. I did not take that factas in any way ominous and onewonders why Hall should eventhink that I should have (at thetime)—as he seems to be saying.Hall's bringing up all that historytends to conceal the fact that hetold me, in a 1975 phone conversa-tion that (see p. 151), \"I found outlater (my italics) thai Frankelworked closely with the FBI overthe years, and was possibly evenunder contract with them from timeto time.\" Hall says this is a \"gross-ly misleading distortion...) wassimply reminding him of what weboth knew at the time (1964).\"That statement seems to be evi-dence in other circumstances).The reason I say this is that the firsttime I ever learned from Hall ofFrankel's FBI involvement was inthe 1975 phone conversation withDick quoted earlier. Hall said hehad subsequently (since 1964)learned it from a kinfolk of hisinvolved In work with a federalintelligence gathering operation,the nature and name of which Hall10made it clear should not be di-vulged. If Hall knew of Frankel'sreported FBI involvement back in1964, then his memory lapsed whenhe said on the phone in 1975 \"Ifound out later,\" and was negligentin 1964 in not telling me. (His June25, 1964, letter only says thatFranker had analyzed reported UFOmaterial for the government.It does not mention the FBI.)Hall did tell me he could now be-lieve that a coverup might haveoccurred, because of Frankel'sFBI past. I have no reason todistort the facts as Hall suggests.I did not say, as he implies, thatHall was, in 1975, \"believing\"(Hall's word in his article) in acoverup. I said that he said he\"Could\" believe, that .a coverupmight possibly have occurred,considering his new knowledge ofFrankel's FBI connection.Hall says that, \"Stanford (p. 151-152) characterizes my publishedreport on the analysis as 'highlydistorted' and accuses me of 'in-tellectual dishonesty' in the way itwas reported.\" Yet he never tellsthe MUFON JOURNAL reader justwhere he published that report.In the first place, I had no way ofknowing who at NICAP had writtenthe report and my reference wasonly to NICAP, never mentioningHall in that context. I did notaccuse Hall. Hall says, \"I publish-ed the results of the one and onlyanalysis report ever given me...\"Yet, in his own MUFON JOURNALarticle he admits that Dr. Frankelcalled him and reported the findingof \"a zinc-iron alloy.\" Yet, thereport (now self-acknowledged tohave been written by Hall) inNICAP's The UFO INVESTIGA-TOR, September-October, 1964,only said the Socorro sample\"...has been identified as silica.\"IT DID NOT TELL OF THE FIRSTAND HIGHLY SIGNIFICANTREPORT.I recommend the reader do exact-ly as Hall suggests and compare histreatment of the facts of the Socorrozinc-iron alloy incident as reportedin NICAP's The UFO INVESTIGA-TOR to my own. Hall did* not dojustice to possibly importantevidence or to the NICAP member-ship by not mentioning Frankel'sfirst report by telephone. He alsostated that the analysis was doneby \"a top Wahsington laboratory,\"but calling Goddard that is not aserious distortion.Hall is fencing with a straw manin his criticism of my mentioningthat police personnel, for whomZamora described or drew thesymbol first-hand, told me whatseemingly contradicts the laterreports. Objective reporting de-manded that I do so. But, Halloverlooks my reason (explained inthe book) for telling the wholestory. Concerning my handwrittenletter of May 3, 1964, to Hall, myintentions were certainly not tosuggest that NICAP \"coverup\"anything. Instead,, I was recom-mending the temporary withhold-ing of information on the actualsymbol seen on the side of theSocorro object, so that there mightbe an otherwise impossible toobtain outside independent valid-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ation via subsequent reports. Thenthe publication of the actual symbolwould be particularly meaningfulonce the scientific 'control' of tem-porarily withholding the facts hadserved its purpose or until itseemed unlikely that correspondingaccounts would come in. SomeUFO researchers' all too great en-thusiasm to rush stories into printmerely to say \"we got it first\"tends to prevent otherwise valuableoutside substantiations whilefueling the fires of hoax. A littleconstraint could go far towardproviding more substantial conver-gent evidence in the long run.Hall makes indefensible accusa-tions reflective upon my personalityand basic character, not to mentionreputation. I shall now demon-strate, by quoting Hall's article andletters from him to me, that hisattack on my former, t eenagedbeliefs (I am now 39), and upon mywork as a psychic, showed disre-gard for facts of which he had longbeen aware.First, Hall says that I present my-self in the book as the scientific\"brains\" (his quote marks) ofProject Starlight International(P.S.I.). Here, as elsewhere in hisarticle, Hall uses a propagandatechnique never used in carefulreporting: he encloses words inquote marks as if they were said byanother (me in this case) when theyare really his own creations. Thebook only says that I am the P.S.I,director, not the equipment en-gineer, nor that I occupy any otherof the paid staff positions in P.S.I.Hall goes on to state, \"WhatI did not know at the time...wasthat Stanford himself was a full-fledged 'contactee'.\" He quotesa foolish article I wrote at the ripeold age of eighteen—when I wasa full believer in Adamski and be-fore I uncovered material to exposeAdamski—in order to impugn myreputation now, twenty years fater.The facts are that Hall has longknown, from the contents of myMay 8,1964; tape recording to himexplaining my position on the 1955-1957 UFO events, that I do not inany way uphold the childish,wishful thinking expressed in thearticle from Cribble's FLYINGSAUCER REVEIW, September,1956, from which he quotes. (Ad uplicate of that May 8, 1964,tape to Hall has now been deposit-ed with MUFON directgor WalterH. Andrus, Jr. for documentation.)I should explain, however, thatI wrote the 1956 artjcle in a greatstate of excitement and wide-eyed enthusiasm because of recentUFO sightings, one of them a close-range one which, because of theinfluence of Adamski's writings, Islmplisticly assumed to have beentelepathically mediated by extra-terrestrials. Although the mostexciting of the involved sightingsbefore the article was a fine, vilid,clear and close-up one, my errorwas unquestionaingly assuming thesighting was a \"contact,\" and inadopting the belief systems of thetypical 1950s contact cultists. ASas result of this general state ofmentality, I often assumed that'information' which may merelyhave been surfacing from my un-conscious was coming to me fromspace beings. Of course, I havelong since abandoned such assump-tions. But, I would ask Hall, whyall the concern about that? Thesedays it is a common thing for 'ab-duct ees' to claim far more spectac-ular experiences that I ever had,and to report that 'humanoids'telepathically influenced them. ButHall's article does not make itclear just what he is so disturbedabout regarding my 1950s UFOexperiences. Is it my belief intelepathy, my UFO sightings, myteenage inability to report themobjectivley, or what?Hall does not speak factuallywhen he says, \"Stanford has nevershared with us what allegedlytranspired during the contacts, orwhat surprising things he learn-ed.\" Can he not now rememberwhat he wrote to me on May 5,1964? In the letter he named mybook LOOK UP! (written and pub-lished at my own expense, when Iwas eighteen and nineteen, toshare what transpired during the'contacts'), and said, \"I have notread your book, but have scannedit and am aware of its generalcontents and approach. It has beenmy feeling that it represents anearlier stage of your intellectualdevelopment, and that you mighteven repudiate this approach tothe subject, now, judging by yourcomments.\" (Myemphasis.)In response I sent Hall the afore-mentioned tape-recorded letterexplaining in depth my change inattitude, stating that the UFOsightings reported in LOOK UP!were real, multi-witness ones,but that I no longer felt myself to bea contactee. I told of how I wisedup to certain of the major contac-tees, Adamski included. Thischange in attitude had made mefeel I misinterpreted the sightingsas being necessarily mediated bytelepathy from UFO operations11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"and as Indicative of any specialrelationship between myself andUFOs.In response, Hall wrote me onMay 19, 1964, saying, \"Thanks foryour tape letter explaining yourcurrent attitudes toward the UFOsubject, contactees, etc. I am gladto know that you are more objectiveand scientific in your outlook now.\"Thus, as of May 19, 1964, Hallknew that my subjectivity as ayouth had changed to objectivityand rejection of my earlier claims.In his MUFON JOURNAL articleHall asks, \"Does he now renouncehis former (my emphasis) claimsof privileged contacts with space-men? If he does, to what does heattribute them? Self delusion?\"Yet his question clearly impliesknowledge that I have alreadydenounced my former interpreta-tions in that he uses the word\"former.\" He also knows, ofcourse, that I attribute them to real,even excellent, UFO sightingswhich incorporated many witnesses(policemen included) and one day-light, color, movie film as evidence,and cedrtainly not to self-delusion.The only delusion was in the sub-jective interpretation I made of theevents as an Adamski-followjngteenager.Next, Hall alleges, \"In .1975Stanford (my emphasis) took out anad in the National Enquirer offeringto sell tape cassettes of 'voices'obtained through 'a meditation-induced unconscious state' frompeople calling themselves 'Bro-thers'.\" Hall adds, knowingly,\"Adamski and other 'contactees'claimed to be contacted by 'SpaceBrothers'.\"12The records of the Association forthe Understanding of Man provethat they (my employer), no I(as Hall asserts), took out the ad.I am responsible to a board ofdirectors and am an employee ofthe organization. If Hall reallywanted to know what my employerwas sell ing, he should have orderedand listened to one of the tapesadvertised, instead of making un-founded intimations that \"SpaceBrother\" supposedly speakthrough me. (If Hall did ordercassettes, he has not revealed it.)On each cassette it is clearlyexplained that the phenomenonintroduced thereon is not claimedto be any manifestation of any per-sonality external to my unconsciousmind. Instead, the materials arepresented because they haveproven helpful and meaningfulto many persons who have listenedto them.Publications of the Associationfor the Understanding of Man andrecords of our membership confer-ences clearly prove that I do. notinsist that voices obtained throughme in the unconscious state areanything other than that. Weremain objective and take an at-titude of open inquiry. I personallydo not believe that any of the mani-fested personalities are UFO oc-cupants. The 'voices' that speakthrough me simply call themselves\"Brothers\" (not \"Space Bro-thers\")—a term in use long beforethe contactee cults. So, I hope thissettles the matter once and for all:The information coming from myunconscious, whether or not onebelieves it to be of a 'psychic'nature, is a thing which belongs tothe realm of altered states of con-sciousness and possible paranormalphenomena, and should in no waybe a part of UFO research. I shouldadd, however, that the work of theAssociation (the parent organiza-tion of P.S.I.), and, hence, thep.s.i. laboratory of instrumentedUFO research, is financed in partby proceeds from sale of informa-tion and discourses obtained frommy unconscious state. We do notregard that as anything of whichto be ashamed.Futhermore, any personal beliefthat I or my associates may haveconcerning the nature or reality ofthe 'voices' that call themselves'Brothers' through my unconsciousis not related to our UFO researchwith technological instruments.Scientists and laymen alike have aright (I hope they still do) to theirown philosophical or religiousbeliefs without that reflecting ontheir day-to-day work as objectivescientists or otherwise. After all,do we condemn Einstein becausehe was a Jew or because he be-lieved in intuition as a source ofmany of his breakthroughs in devel-oping his theories—or otherthinkers or researchers becauseof their personal philosophies orreligions/Hall suggests that I \"passion-ately\" desire to obtain \"objectiveproof of these subjective experi-ences, hence his commitment tothe Socorro sample being 'met-allic'.\" This is hardly the type ofperson of whom he spoke in hisMay 5, 1964 letter to me, saying,\"Your taped report arrived, and Ifound it extremely thorough andintelligently done.\" I believe Hall"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"has changed his position concern-ing me because I have discussed(in the book) .his and NICAP's1964 oversight in not following upon Frankel's report of a zinc-ironalloy.In previous issues of the MUFONJOURNAL, Dick Hall has spokenvery positively and encouraginglyof the work of Project StarlightInternational and of its laboratoryof instrumented UFO research.Now, with publication of Socorro'Saucer' in a Pentagon Pantry, Hallsuddenly .makes statements thatcou Id, ;if accepted without objectiveinvestigation of the facts, impugnthe reputation of that ongoing,instrumented research endeavor,because of his attempts to castdoubts upon my objectivity. Know-ing Richard Hall to be a person whocares for valid efforts in activeUFO research, I hope he will, intime, rectify any bad image hemight have given the P.S.I. RE-SEARCH EFFORT.In fact, until Hall's recent privateactions and the MUFON JOURNALarticle, I had considered hjm avalued friend and champion ofobjective UFO investigation (hisoversights in the summer of 1964notwithstanding). I never imaginedhe would take my reporting of pre-cisely what happened that summerso very personally.In defense of Socorro 'Saucer'in a Pentagon Pantry, I shouldpoint out that the material offensiveto Hall constitues only a smallportion of the book. Actually, manynew Socorro case facts are broughtout, and I think it only fair to beallowed to speak, briefly, on be-half of the book and its value. Itis traditional, in reviewing a bookas Hall did, to list the publisherand price (Blueapple Books, P.O.Box 5694, Austin, Texas 78763,$8.95 postpaid). But that courtesywas not afforded in Hall's account.Now, please consider these facts:(1) Paul Kies and Larry Kratzerare named (and photos of themshown) as additional visual witness-es to the Socorro landing.(2) I reveal that there werethirteen total (visual and auditory)witnesses.(3) There were at least threetypes of strange physical evidencesother than those hitherto revealed:a calcined rock, seeming irradiationof film exposed very soon after theUFO event (a highway.patrolman'sfilm was possible radiation dam-aged and resultantly retained bythe Air Force) and, of course, themetallic slivers on the rock.Of the book's' contribution toUFO facts and to the Socorro case,Dr. Hynek said in a letter of July6, 1976, written specifically forpurpose of publication in promotingthe book:\"In SOCORRO 'SAUCER'INA PENTAGON PANTRY, RayStanford not only tells the storywell but has brought to it a greatdeal of painstaking and intensiveresearch, presenting a far morecomprehensive and coherenttreatment of this important case.The Socorro .case has alwaysbeen a thorn in the side of UFOdetractors who have tried to dis-miss it either as a deliberate at-tempt by the town fathers ofSocorro to promote the touristtrade—or as atmospheric phe-nomena. Ray Stanford hasshown these attempts to be pa-tently untenable. Stanford hastransformed the case from a one-witness matter to a multi-witnesscase and thus has accomplishedwhat the Air Force failed to do.In the preparation of his book,Ray Stanford has exhibited a rarepersistence in tracking down vitaldetails of this remarkable andpivotal UFO sighting.\"John F. .Schuessler, an aero-space engineer well-known toMUFON members, made thiscomment on Socorro 'Saucer' ina Pentagon Pantry, and has givenpermission to be quoted:\"It is a bombshell, obviously wellresearched and should make asignificant impact on the world ofufology.\"I hope that no reader misinter-prets what I have tried to do herein setting the facts straight con-cerning Socorro 'Saucer' in a Penta-gon Pantry and myself. I shouldpoint out that, despite RichardHall's highly personal reaction toparts of the book involving himself,he is an individual in whom I havemuch confidence and I regard himas one of the most discerning con-tributors to ufology in general.MUFON should be proud to havehim as their international coordin-ator and I hope that none of thefacts reported in the book detract(in the mind of anyone) from Dick'shigh level of competence. I trulyregretany personal offense to him.It was simply necessary for me toreport things as I saw them happenduring the Socorro investigation.Now Dick has told his side of italso. I hope readers will actuallysutdy the boook and make up theirown minds which of us is morefactual on the important issuesinvolved. .-"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Bigfoot Sightings ContinueBy Stan GordonDozens of reports of hairy Big-foot-like creatures were made byeyewitnesses during 1976, and thistrend continues through 1977.These creature accounts haveoriginated from Oregon, Washing-ton, Mississippi, Montana, NewJersey, New York, Pennsylvania,Colorado, Texas, California as wellas other areas. Even though nodirect connection can be made,in almost every area where thecreatures had been reported,UFO's were also being sighted.My own conclusion as I have statedbefore, is that we are dealing withseveral different types of Bigfootcreatures. The five toed foot-prints seems to be related to thetypical Bigfoot of the PacificNorthwest, whereas the three toedvariety seems to be closely relatedto the UFO phenomena. Therehave been instances where boththree and five toed tracks haveshown up in the same geogra-phical area. It's impossible tojudge just how many verifiablecreature sightings have been madesine 1976. The following is anexample of some of these reports.Whitehall, New York, Mid-August, 1976:Several witnesses includingpolice officers reported seeing acreature between seven and eightfeet tall, very hairy and with pinkor red eyes. In one instance thecreature came within twenty fivefeet of a Whitehall police car,before being scared off when astate trooper flashed a light in thecreature's eyes. The light causedthe creature to cover it's eyesand run away screaming.14This cast one of several prints found in September of 1973 near Penn.Hills, Pa.

Hisspeech is summed up very nicelyin his \"abstract\" as applied toUFOs.The so-called scientificmethod is an aid to the naturalthought process people use tosolve problems. That processconsists of three parts: 1.recognition of the problem, 2.subconcious construction ofpossible solutions, and 3.acceptance or rejection of thesesolutions by the reasoningfaculty. A problem is a set offacts which is apparently notconsistent with our previousknowledge. The solutionconsists Jn either explaining thefacts or recognizing that they arethe basis for developing newknowledge. Although, scientificinvestigation is an art, there are.five major steps involved: 1.critical review of the relevantmaterial, 2. collection of fielddata supplemented by labora-tory examination of specimenswhere possible, 3. carefuldefinitions of the problem andbreakdown of the problem intospecific questions, 4. construc-tion of hypotheses which givespecific answers to the ques-tions, and 5. devising andcarrying out experiments to testthe answers. Along with thesesteps goes a set of rules usefulfor avoiding errors. One of theserules is: Only consider hypothe-ses that can be tested byexperiments. The investigationof UFO's by the CondonCommittee was indeed scienti-fic, but the committee wasunable to devise any tests ofExtraterrestrial Hypothesis(ETH) which could be experi-mentally proven. The problemwas too hard for the limited timeand resources. Based on close20encounter cases where occu-pants are seen by reliablewitnesses, we should take theETH as proven and try toreproduce the phenomena asso-ciated with flying saucers in ourlaboratories. Theories of physicsand engineering must bemathematically extended toinclude explanations of theobserved non-inertial behaviorand apparent dematerialization.More complete data from thefield are needed to air ourthinking.The Specialization Work^shops, conducted by experi-enced personnel, were designedto not only be educational, butthey gave the participants anopportunity to exchange perti-nent information and personalexperiences.

One might as wellsay that UFOs emanate from thechronosynclastic infindibulum; itwould have about as muchmeaning. Not that I am unable toexercise some imagination andsuppose that there is some realmout there about which we havelittle or no knowledge, residentsof which may be impinging onour world. It may be so. Thepoint of unending fascination tome is why certain \"UFOresearchers\" so readily discardknown realms in favor ofunknown realms as an explana-tory device. (\"Explanatory\" thatis).One of the most notorious andinfluential discarders is JohnKeel. His data are cited as ifthey were established facts byRon Westrum, who proceeds toadvise ufologists on the need tobe healers when UFO witnessesbecome overwhelmed by theirenhanced psychic abilities. I metRon again at the InternationalFortean Organization (INFO)\"Fortfest\" symposium where hegave a good, intelligent paper onthe sociology of anomalyreporting. He is clearly asincere, honest person delvinginto important areas of UFOresearch, bringing to bear theinsights of sociology. I wishmore sociologists and psycholo-gists were involved in UFOresearch; they are badly needed.Especially those knowledgeableabout the history of science andinterested in anomalistic data,as Ron is.This being said, I have to onceagain strongly disagree withRon, both about his data and histheories. He is treading onextremely dangerous ground byapparently encouraging laymento take up therapy on an amateurbasis. If UFO witnesses reallyare experiencing psychologicaldisorders of the nature de-scribed, they obviously needprofessional help.All of this fits the patternwhich is becoming increasinglyclear to me of well-meaningufologists, typically amateurs inthe areas under consideration,rushing into the vacuum createdby professional non-involvementin UFO studies. Bearing thecross of the world, ufologistsnaively attempt to be physicist,psychologist, priest, and healer.They attempt to take on theirshoulders problems that wouldtax the abilities of the world'sgreatest scientists.A more modest and realisticappraisal of the situation wouldcause us to realize that we areoften way over our heads intrying to sort out and makesense of UFO data. I remainunconvinced that the \"data\" weneed to explain is that describedby John Keel. Jacques Vallee,and Jerome Clark. But if it is,then more than ever do we needthe participation of the bestminds in the world if we hope toget a handle on the situation.Otherwise we leave ourselves atthe mercy of a handful ofself-appointed priests whoprofess to have a direct pipelineto truth, arrived at individuallyand without any concertedscientific effort.
