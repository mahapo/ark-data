In it we present one of the most thorough and in- depth investigations of a close encounter case ever to be' pub- lished. We owe this high quality investigat- ion to none other than veteran UFO researcher Len H. Stringfield, not to mention the indis- pensible aid of Bob Pratt of the National Enquirer, Leo Sprinkle of the University of Wyoming, and Jerry Black of MUFON Cin- cinnati . We only wish that every case could be given the complete investigation that we see in the Stan- ford case. Certainly the mere cataloging of close encounter cases is not enough. What we need is a thorough and per- sonnal investigation of each such case, and that of course requires a heavy investment in both man-hours and funds. But it is an in- vestment that I think will eventually pay off handsomely in insights and under- standing of the nature of the UFO problem.

The riddle be- gan with a report from Finnish schoolboy Eero Lammi, who claimed to have been knocked down by a \"beam of light\". He was on his way home to Ulea- borg, near the Swedish border, when he saw a ball of light move across the border from Sweden and apparently land in a nearby field. \"1 went to look at it,\" he said, \"but suddenly a ray of light seemed to beam out from it and 1 felt a searing pain in my chest and everything went black.\" Even his parents thought it was a prank until a doctor found slight burns on the boy's chest and back. New E-M Case Discovered Source: Cronica, 6/5/76 Jose Pascali, a TV techni- cian, did not believe in UFOs — until June 4, 976. Now he says, \"they sure are there.\" He had gone that afternoon to the Los Ranches suburb of Virgen de Lujan, Bahia Blanca, Ar- gentina, to fix a TV set and his car failed at the intersection of Guemes Avenue and the Arroyo del Medio, Pascali then saw, at a height of about 120 meters, a luminous UFO about 30 meters in diameter. The UFO re- mained over the area for some time, then rose taking off toward Tres Arroyos. When it left, his car again functioned normally, \"like magic.\" At the Swedish Military High Command, which investigates all reports of unidentified flying objects, Colonel Bertile Eriks- son said: \"We do not know how it happened. We have been unable to trace anybody else in the area who saw anything unusual on that day.\" However, a second report did come from a university student who was. out bird-watching near Tive- den, 400 miles south of the border. His description of the object tallied exactly with .the measurements given by the boy: \"It was about five meters in width and looked like a moving ball of light.\" Mr. Sture Wickerts, ufologist and research chief at the ^Swe- dish Defence Intelligence Or- ganization, said: \"The stu- dent's name is not being re- ek'ased at the moment.

THE STANFORD, KENTUCKY ABDUCTION by Leonard H. Stringfield The Stanford, Kentucky \"abduction\" case of January 6, 1976, now well publicized inter- nationally, seems destined to become a classic. Its candidacy for thus ufological honor comes from many qualifying sectors. Basically, and of uppermost importance, its credibility is strengthened by the three ab- ductees themselves, who ex- perienced a night of terror. It is the character profile of Louise Smith, Mona Stafford and Elaine Thomas as normal and honest people that is so vital as one ponders the bizarre se- quence of events and the evi- dence: physical and electro- magnetic effects, animal re- action, supporting testimony of additional witnesses of a UFO on the same night — plus the strength of careful and scien- tific investigation. By maintaining continuous communications with the three women and being privileged to share their many ordeals, some- times in confidence, has pro- vided, for this investigator, a wealth of valuable data, not only about the \"time lapse\" incident and subsequent events, but the long range effects on their health and behavior. It is therefore, my firm belief that the Stanford story, which reads like science fiction, is one of the most convincing UFO encoun- ters that I have ever personally investigated. In the period of one year since the incident occurred, the I he \"alxliK-linn\" site, shm>in|> (he entrance lo the COM pasture, flanked In ficldslonc \\>all, where Mrs. Smith's Chevy went out of control while the huge UFO hovered overhead. case has captured the front page headline in the National Enquirer, made top billing in UFO research bulletins and has been aired on numerous radio stations and national TV. Thus, there is little need at this time to recount the many details in the sequence of events during the night of the encounter as the highlights are now public domain. Although some aspects of the case, as reflected in published accounts, have either been treated too briefly, or self- servingly, my observation of certain important sequential data, based on the early first- hand testimony of the three women, have been recorded in my forthcoming hard cover book Situation Red, The UFO Siege, to be published by Doubleday in May, 1977. How- ever, to refresh the reader, I capsulate the story as follows: January 6 was Mona Staf- ford's 36th birthday. It was good reason for Louise Smith and Elaine Thomas to celebrate the occasion with their friend over dinner at the Redwood restaurant located south of Lancaster, Kentucky, on U.S. 27, about 35 miles from their hometown of Liberty. The wea- ther conditions, according to the U.S. Weather Bureau, were the following: 38 deg. F. temp- erature, winds from the south at 15 mph, cloud cover at 10,000 ft., visibility 15 miles. With Louise Smith at the wheel of her 1967 Chevy Nova, they left the Redwood about 11:15 p.m., in a chatty and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I llr lliitt |iii'Hi|i.lK in ihf nisr.

While travelling out of Stanford and heading for Hustonville on Highway 78, the trio witnessed a bright red object in the sky. Mona was frightened. She thought it was a large aircraft on fire. The glowing object came closer and suddenly Mrs. Smith lost control of her car. The speedometer showed 85 mph. Cried Louise, \"I can't hold the car on the road!\" Mona tried to health steer, but in vain. The car held on 85 mph. Louise later commented, \"My foot wasn't even on the gas pedal.\" Within seconds the UFO had ranged close to their car, first following from behind, flipping on end, then came close to the driver's side. All agreed it was enormous, metal- lic and disc-shaped with a dome on top with a ring of red lights at the equator and a single yellow light near the under- belly.

The inside lit up. A later comment by Mrs. Smith: \"A hazy like air, sort of a fog, filled the car.\" Suddenly, a severe burning sensation over- took all three women. Mona remembers her eyes burning with such intensity she couldn't see. Their last cognizance was their car backing crazily into a pasture entrance flanked on either side by a weathered field stone wall. One hour and 20 minutes later they found them- selves intact in the car driving home to Liberty. Shaken, and with exposed areas of flesh smarting from burns, they could not account for the time lapse. When they reached Mrs. Smith's trailer home, the kit- chen clock showed 1:20 a.m. They went to her neighbor, Lowell Lee, for help and there, too, they found the lapse of time confirmed. Confused, des- perate, and unfamiliar with UFO's, they called the police, and the next day a Navy recruiting station, but got no help or sympathy in either place. It was, however, the Navy recruiter who gave the news to a Lexington, Kentucky TV station. Later, the story reached the press and on February 12, 1976 it made big news in the Casey County News. Jerry Black of MUFON in Cincinnati got the newspaper clipping from a friend in Lib- erty, Kentucky. Jerry called Jim Miller, MUFON in Middle- town, Ohio, and me on Feb- ruary 20, to relate the news. He said he had already called Mrs. Smith about the incident some days before. At first the three women were reluctant to dis- cuss the case and they wanted no strangers from out of town to visit their homes. More phone calls were made, creden- tials offered (MUFON, CUFOS etc.) and finally their confi- dence was won. An interview"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"was arranged for February 29. To put them further at ease, Black invited Mrs. Peggy Schnell of Blanchester, Ohio, who could provide a reassuring feminine touch and offer the compassion of sharing her own weird UFO experience occur- ring during the flap of 1973. Our first meeting was cor- dial, candid and rewarding. But, it was obvious at the outset that the trio was enduring great physical strain from their dra- matic experience. All three chain-smoked, enough to prompt me to comment. All agreed that it was the result of their tensions, and also men- tioned they had a lingering in- satiable thirst for liquids fol- lowing the incident. Also, each claimed excessive loss of weight. Black, Miller and I made copious notes as we extracted details about the sequence of events, their observations of the UFO, its, structure and be- havior, their claims of physical effects — all ugly, pent-up memories leading up to the phase of time lapse. Said Mrs. Thomas, the most stoic of the trio, \"We live in fear of what we don't know. I'm worried about Lou and Mona. I think they're ready for a breakdown.\" Mrs. Smith admitted that she had great difficulty facing peo- ple while attending her duties as an assistant for the Casey County Extensive Office (coun- selling families in nutritional care). Mrs. Stafford was the most distressed pyschologically. With her eyes still showing strong traces of inflammation, she was insistent in her plea to know what happened to her during the time lapse. 1 assured her that I would make every effort to get professional help to perform regressive hypnosis as soon as possible. This was to be my number one goal. During our brisk day of gathering data, we were privy to see evidence of two dramatic effects of the close encounter. One was the result of the UFO's thermal light beam; seeing first hand the vestige of a flesh burn suffered by Mrs. Smith. Having kept it under close observation, she obligingly lifted her hair to show us the mark on the nape of her neck. There, unmistak- ingly, was a round pinkish-gray blotch the size of a half dollar. The second revelation was animal reaction. This involved a 4-year old pet parakeet belonging to Mrs. Smith. Ac- cording to its mistress, when she arrived home following her incident, the parakeet, nor- mally peaceful, rebelled at her presence. She said the bird bolted against the screen of the cage, its wings fluttering vio- lently. Commented Louise, \"Since that night the bird has nothing to do with me.\" 1 tried a test. Being familiar with exotic birds, allowing them to fly free in my tropical garden room, 1 persuaded Mrs. Smith, in the presence of Jim Miller and myself, to put her finger inside the 'cage. .The bird panicked! Next, 1 put my finger inside. The parakeet only budg- ed on its perch. Then Jim duplicated the test. Again, the bird only budged. The pet parakeet died in March, 1976. Could Mrs. Smith's traumatic state have rubbed off to affect the bird's sensorium, thus triggering it's violent reaction? Or, had she become a walking force field? Whatever the strange-emission she generated, it may also have affected other mechanical de- vices such as the wrist watch she wore during the incident, whose minute hand, on her return home, sped around the dial like the second hand; and, during the next week, the non- electric alarm clock in hrr bedroom which when touched, stopped running. So disturbing was the alarm clock incident 10 Pho'.o (aken b} Jerry Black, February 24, shoeing trace of burned mark on the nape of Mrs. Smith's neck.

Then, too, there was Louise's Chevy Nova which de- veloped electrical failures. This she discovered when she first tried to drive the car after the incident. While driving to work, she was stopped by the police who informed her that her signal lights were not working. Out of concern for the de- bilitating health status of the three women, and feeling as- sured that we all had won each other's complete confidence, we all agreed on February 29 that the affair should not be further publicized. I later called Walter Andrus of MUFON and Dr. Allen Hynek of CUFOS to inform them of the incident and stated that I preferred the data to be kept confidential. They agreed. Black, Miller, Ms. Schnell and 1 departed from Liberty at dusk, a five hour drive to Cin- cinnati ahead of us.

The time lapse and all its secrets was like a time bomb in our thoughts. Its potential impact ticked away in our minds all the way home > Back in Cincinnati, during the next week, 1 again called Hynek for his advisement on getting professional psychiatric help to probe the time lapse. The problem was two-fold: distances of competent and cooperative help, and funding. In our conversation the name of Dr. Berthold Schwarz came up, a psychiatrist living in Mont- clair, New Jersey, who had dis- tinguished himself in the pur- suit of many UFQ-related psy- chological cases. 1 called Dr. Schwarz, but, understandably, he was not in a position to make the trip. However, he recom- mended two prominent psy- chiatrists, whom I considered calling at the first opportunity. 1 also suggested Dr. Leo Sprin- kle, APRO's consultant in psy- chology in Laramie, Wyoming, but we agreed that his great distance from Kentucky, and funding the trip, were big problems regarding his ser- vices. While I was eating dinner on March 5, 1976, Jerry Black called. Shaken, he said he had just received a call from Mrs. Smith stating that Dr. Leo Sprinkle of APRO had flown to Louisville and was at the home of Bill Terry, ready to depart to Liberty the next morning to perform hypnosis on Mrs. Staf- ford. Black was disturbed, thinking that I had brought in Dr. Srinkle without consulting him. Indeed, it took only a second to clear the air: Dr. Sprinkle's plans were news to me! Perplexed, Black then called the womfin to discuss the issues and all had agreed not to allow Sprinkle and Terry at their homes to conduct the hypnotic tests. According to Mrs. Smith, she and her companions were of the opinion that Dr. Sprinkle was the MUFON or CUFOS specialist 1 had promised to deliver! She knew nothing about Dr. Sprinkle's associa- tion with APRO, or even APRO. Typical of UFO research without discipline, there was a melee of phone calls back and forth from Black in Cincinnati to Liberty and Louisville and I could sense the utter frustration being experienced by everyone, especially Dr. Sprinkle. I knew Sprinkle, having met him at the MUFON Symposium in Des Moines, June, 1975, where he presented a paper. I had, and have, the greatest respect for him as a person and his compe- tence in the field of psycho- logical research in ufology and as a specialist in regressive hypnosis. Despite the confu-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"sion, 1 was pleased to know that he had gotten as far as Louis- ville. 1 called Dr. Sprinkle at Terry's house and said so. But the issues, beyond that were far from solved. ' As the plot deepened, and with visions of another Travis Walton fiasco, I decided (and it was agreed upon by all parties) to call the Lorenzens of APRO in Tucson. Nearing midnight, it was my hope that I could make a sensible arrangement to per- mit Dr. Sprinkle to proceed to Liberty. After much bloodlet- ting over the issues on hand, accord with APRO (Jim and Coral Lorenzen) was achieved. We agreed that the immediate results of the hypnosis would not be published in our respec- tive bulletins and hopefully not the national media, as long as the three women were in a highly emotional state. The date was set for Sunday, March 7, for Sprinkle, Terry, and for Black, Miller, Schnell and my- self to meet at Mrs. Smith's trailer. As a side comment on the behind-the-scene activity dur- ing the early investigation, Bill Terry called me in the evening following his visit with Mrs. Smith in Liberty, March 1st, which was the day following the MUFON visit from Cincinnati. Although Terry did not men- tion APRO's involvement to Mrs. Smith during his visit, or to me by phone, he tpld me later that he called the Loren- zens about his findings. Ac- cording to Terry, with whom I had built up a cordial relation-, ship in the exchange of UFO information since 1974, his call to APRO was triggered by his interest in the Sergeant Moody abduction case which he knew APRO had investigated and it was his belief that the Kentucky On the Liherlt M-CTK-. June 23, reach l«i begin the polygraph and hypnosis sessions. Left to right, Bob Pratt of National Enquirer, James Young, polygraph expert from the Lexington Police incident might serve their re- search with valuable correlative data. Personally, I hold no ill- feelings toward anyone involved in the case despite the gross misunderstandings. And it was never my intention, obviously, of \"scooping\" the Stanford story. My main concern throughout the early (and still continuing investigation,) has been the health and welfare of three victimized women, as all persons directly involved in the case are well aware. My second concern is that the data col- lected serves UFO research objectively: . The rendevouz in Liberty started at midday, March 7. Greetings were cordial and there was a pledge of coopera- tion. .We decided to conduct the hypnosis of Mona (Louise arid Elaine not consenting to hyp- nosis) at her parent's home where there was more room. Everybody sat in tense silence watching Dr. Sprinkle calmly and methodically put his sub- Departnienl, Len Slringfield, and Or. Leo Sprinkle, APRO psychology consultant who conducted the hypnosis.   .•'. ject at ease, then into a deep hypnotic state. Mona's replies to the questions came slowly. She agonizingly recalled the UFO and her responding fear that it was an aircraft in fiery distress; the UFO in different flight attitudes; the sickening heat; the darkness and an unexplained light, but she could not go further into the deep secrets of her time lapse. Mona, tearful, seemed exhaust- ed. More time was needed and time ran out.  $ Dr. Sprinkle had to return to Louisville with Terry, there to catch his plane to Lararnie. Before departure, he told me that Mona was still in a post- hypnotic state and that I might continue to work with her based on certain guidelines. As Black continued to ques- tion Louise and Elaine,' Mona moved quietly to a chair near a large coffee table. Edging my chair close to Mona, I withdrew from my briefcase, a folder depicting a group of humanoids 1 had drawn representing the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Drawing of humanold occupant recalled by Louise Smith after hypnosis, dated October 1, 1976. 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"different types of configura- tions and heads described by witnesses in previous encoun- ters. Jim Miller stood by and watched in silence. Uncere- moniously, I placed the folder on the table and said nothing. Up to this time no mention had been made of a possible hu- manoid factor in the Stanford time lapse case. A minute or so passed by: more silence. Then, Mona's eyes brightened as she stared at the folder. Suddenly, her finger reached out and pointed to one of the weird, crinkled heads. \"This looks like the light I saw...It was shaped like that head!\" Mona sat reflectively, then she added, \"Yes...I can see the face now but it doesn't seem solid. It comes and goes...I mean, fades and reappears like in a fog. Its eyes are far apart and at the bottom...the chin...is like that drawing.\" She could recall no more. But this was the breakthrough. We had pierced the barrier of the time lapse. The next d ay, M arch -'8, according to my UFOLOG notes, I called Dr. Sprinkle at the University of Wyoming. I informed him of Mona's recall of a humanoid head surround- ed by fog. Promptly, I sent him a copy of the drawings with the designated head encircled. Also enclosed was Mona's statement relative to her recall of the apparition. I told him to send a copy to A PRO as per our agree- ment to work in cooperation. Weeks, unfortunately, turn- ed into months of stalemate. Black and I stayed in touch with the three women by phone on a constant basis. The women continued to wallow in fears, experienced many frightening physical events and continued to lose weight. Needed was the return of Dr. Sprinkle, or some- one else to take over the case. I discussed this with Dr. Sprinkle whom I met later at the CUFOS Conference in Chicago, April 30-May 1. We talked about funding, or lack of it, and while there, in the afterhours, I ap- proached Dr. Hynek again on the matter of funding. It was not a good question at that time. No funds were available, although he recognized the need for a list of professional consultants who could under- take field trips within a limited radius of their home base. On May 12, I called Coral Lorenzen in Tucson. We dis- cussed the stalemate in the Stanford case and she said she would consider financing Dr. Sprinkle for a return trip to Liberty. On June 10, Coral called me and said she was considering sending Dr. James Harder of Berkeley, California, an adept at regressive hypnosis, to Liberty for a follow-up, as he was planning a visit to APRO headquarters soon and he might be able to extend his trip to Liberty. I heard nothing more about Harder, but on June 16, I called Coral regard- ing a request by the Louisville Times for hew data to publish on the Stanford case. As per our agreement, I told her that I had refused the request. Then came the sudden an- nouncement on July 1st by Jerry Black, who, acting unilaterally, called Bob Pratt at the National Enquirer. He had made a deal. In concert with the three .wo- men, he basically had negoti- ated a swap of their close en- counter story with the National Enquirer in return for the tabloid's financing the return of Dr. Leo Sprinkle to Liberty, to conduct regressive hypnosis, and a polygraph test to be conducted by an expert yet to be named. In the terms, Black agreed to the stipulation that if the time lapse case turned out to be an abduction, backed by professional testimony, the Na- tional Enquirer would get first rights to publish the story and, in turn, the three women would receive remuneration for their cooperation. Black, Miller and I were to pay all trip expenses out of our own pockets, as we had done in the past. Black's daring move, he aver- red, was out of concern for the women's health and to free their anxieties that had built up over the time lapse. He could not wait for funding or other delays by CUFOS, MUFON or APRO. My reaction was mixed at first. Being impervious to shock after 27 years spent in ufology, I was, however, caught off-guard and felt some embarrassment for the stagnating agreement I had vowed to uphold about keeping the story out of the national media. However, there were some pluses. Foremost was relief that research had another chance at breaking the time lapse. And, I was heart- ened that Sprinkle was the choice to try! ,The meeting place was at the Brown Motel in Liberty, June 23, 1976. It was a sapping-hot day as felicitous greetings were exchanged with the old dra- matis personae. And it was a pleasure to see Bob Pratt again, the National Enquirer's top UFO investigator-reporter. A true yet in the news business, Pratt had impressed: me as sincere, honest. We had met at the CUFOS Symposium in Chicago on May 31, 1976. At that time, ironically, Pratt had asked me for the Stanford case story, but I refused out of 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"'1 Aw'//'').^%\\i^T' V V \\\\ ^wlfS X x. ^<^.\"L.>- \\crr >c^i-r- —. .i— Drawing by Louise Smith of a \"kind of Instru- ment I saw aboard the craft,\" recalled vividly about 1:00 p.m., September 30, 1976. She said, \"The line from the center to the outer edge was going around counter clockwise as though a light was running through a coil.\" dedication to the proverbial agreement. The mood of the day was serious. Without delay the bus- iness of polygraph tests got underway. James Young, de- tective for the Lexington Police Department, was the expert. After completion of his lengthy tests, executed privately for each of the three women, Young's facial expression wax- ed between triumph and amazement. Skeptical about UFOs when he came to the scene, Young said that his subjects \"breezed through\" their incredible story and poly- graphically came out of the tests as credible people. In a matter of several hours, he admitted his views on the UFO had changed. He said he be- lieved that all three women were telling the truth, even overcoming his strategy of em- ploying one trick manuever 12 which suggested they were per- petrating a hoax to gain pub- licity and money. Now the stage was set for Dr. Sprinkle's hypnotic sessions. It is beyond the scope of this Journal to publish the length verbatim questions and answers contained in tapes of the entire hypnotic proceedings. Dr. Sprinkle superbly handled the hypnosis and it is the belief of all witnesses that significant information was obtained to get to the roots of the time lapse secrets, thus providing suffi- cient credence to the hypothesis of abduction. The first hypnosis was per- formed with Mrs. Smith the subject, during the evening following the polygraph tests. The following day, all women were subjects, each making the regression circuit twice. Sitting next to Mona, Louise and Elaine during these sessions, I watched their great emotional psycho-physical stresses as they slowly, agonizingly and tear- fully relived and related their experiences. Sometimes a phase of long silence was punctuated by a sudden recall of an inci- dent so horribly disconcerting that the subject's body writhed and contorted in pain. Unquestionably, the treat- ment received by each of the women inside the round dark room, as each described their captive abode, was harsh in- deed, even torturous. While no sexual molestations were re- vealed, each woman complain- ed about the rigors of being restrained forcibly by their humanoid captors into a de- mobilized position for physical examination.

According to each subject, their bodies were scanned (de- spite no recollection of being disrobed) and instruments used in exerting great pressure on the limbs. Mrs. Thomas recalls a tube with a bullet-like tip, probing her chest and also recalls, as did Mrs. Stafford, that a warm liquid was applied to their faces and bodies. During the hypnotic sessions twice-held for each woman, characteristic details of the humanoids never reached a point of clarity. Each described shadowy forms floating or glid- ing by them or the emergence of one eye, or two, hovering over them. One bizarre phase re- called by Mona was the sight of a light at the end of a shaft or tunnel which she described as a volcano with \"jagged edges\". It was during this frame of time that she complained of inten- sive pressure to her eyes, Louise Smilh undergoes hypnosis by Dr. Sprinkle while Bob Pratt tapes the proceedings, June 23-24, 1976. \"...Just like they've been pulled out.\" Following this, Mona was impressed by a single bright purple eye that seemed to radiate lightning-like rays. Elaine was percipient to a two-eyed form like a round head in deep darkness. One eye, she said, was a \"beautiful blue\" encircled by a blue membranous lid, \"like a tur- tle's\" and the other eye ap- peared dark. Louise, during hypnosis said she saw several forms but was so frightened that she didn't keep her eyes open long enough to remember any details. It wasn't until months later that she conjured up a vision of her captors. Similar in general appearance to the humanoids seen by her companions, she added that their hands looked like jagged wing tips. It was Elaine who, during hypnosis, .recalled the most about the entities in the room. \"There were several small figures,\" she said, \"about 4 feet tall.\" All three subjects stated that their captors communicated telepathically — never verbally. No one recalled an entity with a mouth! Perhaps the most revealing drama about the alleged craft was witnessed by Mona, on Sunday morning following the previous day's hypnotic ses- sions. While we were sitting around summarizing the \"ab- duction,\" 1 asked Mona if she could elaborate on her hypnotic reference to a volcano. Without hesitation, she re- lated that she could now \"see\" a room...like through a tun- nel...at the end of which was a bright light. As the picture emerged, she could see a square table top upon which lay a prostrate figure of a woman surrounded by a group of four small figures clad in white. They appeared to be studying, or examining the subject under a brilliant white light. She said, \"I'm not sure if the person was Elaine, or Lou, or maybe 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Mona Stafford under hypnosis. even me. Providing additional evi- dence for the Stanford case are a number of people I reached who testified they witnessed a UFO oh the same evening, January 6, 1976, in the Casey and Lincoln County areas. One couple, living within several hundred yards of the \"abduction\" site, watched from their house window a large, lumnious object shaped like a light bulb pass low over the Stanford area. Significantly, the time of this sighting was about 11:30 p.m. Although the couple preferred anonymity, other reports of UFO sightings, observed earlier in the evening, were more detailed, each de- scribing a ring of red or orange lights around a disc-shaped object. Two teenagers told me they pursued a low-level UFO in a hotrod after they watched it hover over the Angel Manu- facturing plant in Stanford. Their chase took them as far as Danville, Kentucky, to the 14 north. They gave their report to the police there. Another UFO report of sig- nificance surfaced when Jerry Black, during a later trip to Liberty, learned that the owner of the farm property where the incident occurred had observ- ed, \"down the road\" from his farm, an unusual low-level, glowing, white object which shot a beam of white light down to the ground. The time was about 10 p.m., however, the sighting's only weakness is that he could not pin down the date...whether it occurred Jan- uary 5th or 6th. More positive about the date, January 6, is Mrs. Janet Stewart of Bethel, Minnesota, who ex- perienced a close encounter with a UFO causing her physi- ological effects. Although Beth- el and Stanford are great distances apart as the crow flies, they may not be so un- related when one considers the UFO's capabilities. The Bethel report, received from Joe Brill, begins with Mrs. Stewart driv- ing alone at 7:30 p.m. to pick up a girl friend with whom she planned to attend a night school class in Moundview.

Stringfield Two close encounter cases are currently being investigat- ed, both occurring on the same date — January 27,1977 — and within a short distance from each other. One incident occurred in Prospect, Kentucky, near Lou isville. Involved is a 19-year-old male (name withheld at this time) who, while driving a Jeep- ster alone from his girlfriend's house to his home, encountered a low-level, luminous red, rec- tangular object hovering along- side the road. The boy recalls being attracted to the object; Then Limbo! He next recalled driving home, his eyes burning and being greeted by his con- cerned mother. His mother confirms that her son suffered eye inflammation and skin irritation to both legs. There were also alleged electro- magnetic disturbances to his vehicle. Local researchers con- ducted regressive hypnosis which revealed that he was abducted into a large room where he encountered three robot-like entities, each having mechanical arms which probed at his body. The second case involves a concerned business man (pre- ferring anonymity) while driv- ing through Clarksville, Ten- nessee. Incensed by his bizarre experience, he flew to Wash- ington, D.C. to report his close encounter to the \"authorities\". He also witnessed entities ap- pearing \"half visible\" who com- municated telepathically. The lone witness was reluctant to relate full details by telephone. Hopefully, more information is forthcoming for both en- counters and will reveal corre- lative details. Eighth Annual MUFON Symposium Scheduled Preliminary scheduling for the annual MUFON Sympos- ium has been completed. The Symposium will take place on Saturday, July 16, and Sunday, July 17, 1977 at the Safari Hotel & Convention Center, 4611 N. Scottsdale Rd., Scottsdale, Arizona 85251. The public is invited to the affair, which will be hosted by Ground Saucer Watch and MUFON of Ari- zona. Advance registration may be made by writing to: GSW/ MUFON, 13238 N. 7th Dr., Phenoix, AZ 85029. The pack- age price for the Symposium is $16.00. Besides MUFON Director Walt Andrus and GSW Di- rector William Spaulding, speakers will include Bill Pitts, MUFON State Director for Arkansas, and James McCamp- bell, author of UFOlogy and MUFON Director of Research. 16 Dr. William Hassell will pre- sent his paper \"Future Physics and Anti-Gravity\" and Dr. Alvin H.

The object was filmed, but was too distant for details to be seen on the film. An article in the February issue of Fate re-examines some of the seeming evidence that UFOs are interfering with satel- lites, lunar ALSEP stations, etc. A very interesting aspect of the subject. This issue also contains Jerome darks' revelation that the \"classic\" airship story of Alexander Hamilton's rustled heifer was merely a practical joke of the period. Since I have been instrumental in publi- cizing this particular account over the years, I would like to apologize for doing so, al- though the true nature of the case has only recently become known. Even so, better truth than \"classic\" tales. The February issue of Cos- mic Frontiers contains several articles relating to UFOs, but overall, this issue is no better than the first one. It is a very nicely-done publication, but the material is rehash. Larry W. Bryant's article on the FBI's role in UFO investi- gations would be ample reason to buy the March issue of UFO Report. A most interesting look at the Bureau's non-public involvement in the subject. This issue also features articles by Wendelle C. Stevens, Gray Barker, Gordon Lore, Curt Sutherly and others. Rumor has it that Kevin Randle is editing a new maga- zine, Quest, due on newsstands. in February. More details in later columns. Two recent publications from the Center for UFO Studies are worthy of mention here. The first is Vicente-Juan Ballester Olmos' A Catalogue of 200 Type-1 Events in Spain and Portugal ($4.50). This is an excellent compilation of close- approach sightings from 1914 to 1975. It includes reports of landings, occupant sightings, EM effects, etc. Ballester Ol- mos is to be contratulated for his work and Richard Heiden deserves credit for his help with this project. The catalogue con- tains photos, illustrations and graphs pertaining to the various cases. A well-done and in- teresting addition to the lit- erature. 1 am not quite so enthused with the second publication, the Proceedings of the 1976 CUFOS Conference. This, of course, was the (in)famous \"secret\" conference, held dur- ing the period of April 30-May 2, 1976. All the papers pre- sented at the conference are to be found in this volume, al- though, in my opinion, at least 60% of them are \"utter dulls- ville,\" for various reasons. Par- ticipants included such well- known researchers as Ted Bloe- cher, Vicente-Jaun Ballester Olmos, Ann Druffel, Loren Gross, Richard Hall, David Jacobs, Robert Klinn, James McCampbell, John Musgraye, David R. Saunders, R. Leo Sprinkle, David Webb, Ron Westrum, Don Worley and several others. Topics covered ranged from the periodicity of flaps to exosociology to hu- manoid and creature reports, plus many other subjects. There is a considerable amount of technical information, which, while undoubtedly of value, makes for quite boring reading. But, 1 suppose my major com- plaint about the Proceedings is its price of $15.00. Yes, it's a large volume, comparable to The UFO Evidence or Ted Bloecher's Report on the UFO Wave of 1947, but, in my opinion, it is decidely not worth the price being asked for it.

Furthermore, I wonder why he allows the \"radicals\" to find \"enough cases to indicate\" anything when this privilege is disallowed to the rest of us. When it is further alleged that the \"liberals\" are \"stagnating themselves and the UFO search,\" the biased nature of the author's polemics may be clearly seen. The real issue, not illumi- nated by this rather inappro- priate application of political labels, is whether there are viable alternative hypotheses to the extraterrestrial visitor hypo- thesis. To be \"open minded,\" an ETH advocate must explore alternatives and constantly re- view the data and his/her rea- soning. If and when the evi- dence strongly contradicts ETH, or some competing hy- pothesis better explains the data, then the ETH would be untenable. Advocates of other hypotheses — if they are rea- soning logically and scientif- ically — would follow a similar process. As for reasonable discourse among the various advocates, it would help (outside those in- stances where outright dishon- esty or psychological disorders are evident) if each \"attacked\" or criticized the other's use of facts and logic rather than their intentions or personalities. If an idea is wrong or misguided, it should be possible to make the case without labelling or char- acterizing the purveyor of the idea in a negative or insulting fashion. It would be very easy for me to counter Mr. Howard's re- marks by stating my opinion that his \"radicals\" are doing the reverse of \"stagnating\" UFO research — they are muddying it up by speculating wildly in terms that often have little empirical meaning. I don't claim to be simon pure in the matter of tending to think other advocates are either dishonest or nutty, which is, undoubtedly, overdone on all sides. However, I do bridle at the \"radicals\" oft-times pretensions to super- ior objectivity, usually coupled with derogatory remarks about researchers who disagree with their approach to the problem. I know that the \"radicals\" consider me to be closely linked with the \"nuts-and-bolts\" hardware ET view, and they are right — up to a point. \"But they do me (and others) an injustice by failing to recognize that I am entirely capable of giving due consideration to modifications of ETH or other alternatives. We \"liberals\" are not hide- bound; merely looking for com- pelling evidence. Apparently the only way to be \"open minded\" to a \"radical\" is to be a \"radical.\" Thus, about all I can agree with is Mr. Howard's last para- graph. We do need to avoid becoming enamored of our own views and failing to consider alternative views. But even there, I think \"infighting\" is a natural and important process, provided it is done in the scientific spirit. * * * * A number of interesting close encounter cases are included in this issue, but I have now polemicized myself out of space to comment on them. They contain strong physical evi- dence aspects, somehow sug- gesting to me that we are dealing with real, physical, technological objects — or reasonable facsimiles thereof. IMark R. Hertxtrin Astronomy Notes - February 1977 MERCURY — Except for the first few days of the month, Mercury is too close to the sun for observation.
