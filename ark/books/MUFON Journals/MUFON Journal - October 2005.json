A number of potential authors have said they have been affected in one way or another by the recent Gulf Coast ca- tastrophe and cannot work on papers at this time. Since we do not want to penalize these folks, we have extended the deadline. The intent is still the same.

In 1965, The UFO Investiga- tor stated, \"All [these animals] saw something new and strange. Not being affected by official denials, they reacted normally-from fear.\" The article goes on to say, \"The UFO-animals reports, therefore, should not be neglected. They are proof the UFOs do exist.\" This paper is a preliminary attempt to understand some finer points of the UFO-animal interaction. What is it about the UFO that is causing the animals to react? Do ani- mal reactions as described by witnesses add supportive evidence regarding the UFO event? What, if anything, do ani- mal reactions tell us about UFOs? The approach here is to take into con- sideration the normal sensory percep- tions and behaviors of the animals, and to view the UFO events from that per- spective. Suggestions, speculations, and the hypothesis developed in this pa- per are presented for future testing as more data is gathered. GENERALIZATIONS Viewing all animal reports as a whole, the following generalizations emerged. •Animal reactions as described by witnesses are reasonable, not bizarre. •Fear is the most common reaction. •The sightings with animal reactions Joan Woodward with two of her animal friends. are relatively close encounters, and the UFOs tend to linger. •Sound associated with the UFO is important, but its importance varies with the types of animals present. •EM, physiological effects, and other various secondary effects are variable and scattered through sightings in low numbers where animals are fearful. Conversely, they are absent in sightings where animals are indifferent, unaware, or calm. Distance of the UFO may be a factor causing this variability. •The shape of the UFOs is variable and generally unrelated to the reactions of animals. Suspecting that interesting aspects of the animal reaction-UFO relationship might be obscured by looking at all animal reaction sightings en masse, the sightings were also examined by types Editor This article is abridged from Ms. Woodward's full presentation, includ- ing charts, case descriptions, and other material, which is included in the 's Note MUFON booklet Animal Reactions to UFOs. The full report is also in- cluded in the 2005 MUFON Sympo- sium Proceedings.

The following correlations are sug- gested from this approach: 4 Barnyard birds may be more likely to react if the UFO passes roughly over- About the Author Ms. Woodward worked with the Na- tional Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) in the 1960's, assisting with the original UFO Evidence (1964). She returned to ufology in 1996 as a field investigator for MUFON and the Fund for UFO Research after retiring from the U.S. Geological Survey as a research technician. She assisted Richard Hall in devel- oping an index of James E. McDonald's correspondence in the Donald E. Keyhoe Archives, and worked on data compila- tion for Hall's Allen Invasion or Human Fantasy? Ms. Woodward later took over the animal reactions section of Francis Ridge's special evidence section of the NICAP web site. She also has extensive experience with both domestic and wild animals.

Possibly the birds are sensitive to vibration or pressure changes. 4 Cats demonstrating fear may be re- acting to low frequency or harsh sounds. 4 When ungulates are reported as fearful, two UFO features are regularly reported in those sightings: (1) unfamil- iar, high-pitched and/or loud sounds, and (2) the play of lights and shadows in nighttime sightings as UFOs light the terrain or project light beams. Both this type of sound and these lighting/shadow effects are known factors in spooking ungulates. 4 When dogs react, sound seems an important factor as suggested by the following: 1. Possible association between high-pitched sounds and more fearful dogs. Some dogs appear to actually suffer pain associated with high-pitched sounds. 2. Possible association between sounds not described as high-pitched and less fearful dogs. 3. UFO sound is frequently not re- ported when dogs do not react or react calmly. 4. Howling is very likely to be caused by UFO sound, and there is some sug- gestion the stimulus can be so over- whelming as to cause howling in oth- erwise very unlikely circumstances. These trends suggest some obvious questions to be presented to witnesses, and these questions are suggested at the end of each section, and in more gen- eral terms, at the end of the paper. BACKGROUND & METHODS In 2002, Richard Hall suggested that I summarize UFO sightings that con- tain animal reactions for the Special Studies section of Francis Ridge's NICAP web site. Over the next couple of years I sub- mitted more than 100 summaries of UFO sightings into Category 4, Ani- mal Reactions. These summaries were written from the perspective of-and with emphasis on-the animal reaction aspect of the sighting. This paper is based on 104 of these animal reaction summaries, all which can be found at www.NICAP.org/cat4.htm. The 104 sightings came from mate- rial that was readily available to me. Although both are domesticated animals, dogs and cats have different senses and personalities, and may react to the same UFO event differently. The two primary sources were the Donald E. Keyhoe Archives and the MUFON UFO Database CD/ROM. The Keyhoe Archives contained much NICAP material and other books and publications. Whenever possible, I backtracked to the earliest version of a sighting that I could find, because some details of the animal reactions were frequently deleted in subsequent accounts. The MUFON CD/ROM, produced by T. David Spencer, contains 1200 sightings as summarized on the Field Investigator's Form 2. These were combed for sightings with animal re- actions that offered some detail about the animal aspect of the sighting. The resulting collection of sightings is hopefully a fairly random sampling of sightings that happened to have ani- mals present during a UFO event, with their reactions noted. It is not a comprehensive review of animal reaction sightings in the litera- ture, and does not include the series by Creighton in the Flying Saucer Review published in the 1970s. For space and convenience reasons, a coded number is assigned to each sighting. The AR (Animal Reaction) code numbers range from A01 to AR104 and the numbers are in chro- nological order from the earliest to the most recent sightings. [Appendix I (included in the full re- port) lists the AR number, location, date, and reference for each sighting, but is not included in this article due to space restrictions.] The criteria for sightings in this re- port are that they must have some de- tails about the animal reaction, and the UFO must not be an obvious IFO. Frequently, when animal reactions are mentioned in UFO reports, the de- scriptions are minimal, such as \"dog excited\" or \"cattle reacted.\" Without additional details, neither of these would be included. In order to simplify and make the data set manageable, this study is con- fined to animal reactions to UFOs in the sense of unidentified flying hard- ware. No further assumptions are made about the objects or about their origins. Creature reports and abduction re- ports were not included. The reactions of the animals and witnesses are only those reactions that happened simulta- neous with the sighting. For purposes of closer examination and comparisons between types of ani- mals, animal behaviors described in the sightings are classified as follows: Indifferent or unaware Uneasy, nervous Calm, interested, approach Alert-alarm Howling (dogs) Fearful The Uneasy through Fearful catego- ries are a continuum of behavior from unease to fearful to very fearful. An MUFON UFO Journal October 2005"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"animal that becomes uneasy and then alarmed, but not described as fearful, would be classified as having an alert-alarm reaction. An animal described as fearful will have gone through the uneasy to alert-alarm stages before becoming fearful, but would be classified as fear- ful. The most intense behavior on the continuum is the one recorded for the event. Unaware, Calm, and Howling are separate behaviors rather than on a con- tinuum. Infrequently within a sighting, one animal will react with two differ- ent behaviors. In AR49 a watchdog ran barking in alarm, but on nearing the UFO, it stopped and howled. In this case, two behaviors are recorded for the same dog-Alert-Alarm and Howling. Within one sighting, two animals may react differently. In AR41 a cat ran when a noisy UFO approached at low altitude, but a dog slept through the event (no information on the dog's age or hearing capabilities), resulting in two \"units\" of behavior recorded for one sighting. Problems and cautions: Some of the problems associated with animal reac- tion studies are listed below. • The description of the animal re- action is only as good and as reliable as the witness who is describing the en- tire UFO event. • Animals, like people, can be inter- ested in, fooled by, or frightened by mundane things. Horses will shy and bolt when a piece of paper blowing with the wind nears them. Cattle may be afraid of the sound of a new power tool. Dogs will raise alarm over virtually nothing. • All animals may react to the ex- citement or fear of witnesses rather than to the UFO itself. In AR92, a percep- tive witness comments that the dogs were possibly reacting to the witness' excitement, rather than to the UFO. • An animal reaction and the sight- ing of a UFO may be a coincidence. One November, 1999, evening, two women looked outside when they heard their dog bark. They saw a train of lights they estimated to be 30 feet away and near the ground (Kulka, 2001). However the location, timing, and description of this sighting fits perfectly with a spectacular meteor that broke up into a meteor train that was seen over 8 or 10 states. The odds are that the bark- ing of the dog in this event was coinci- dental to the sighting. Peter Davenport's National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) posted more than 200 reports of this meteor event, 9 of which reported dogs present. None of these dogs were reported to have noticed the meteor. • I am sure animals that do not react are under-represented. The non-reac- tion of a dog accompanying the wit- nesses might be noticed and reported, but in the case of cattle out in a field or horses in a barn or chickens in a coop, their non-reaction is much less likely to be noticed. • The sighting data is relative to the witness and not necessarily to the ani- mal. An obvious example would be in the estimate of distance of the UFO, usually given relative to the witness, but not necessarily to the animal, which may be closer or farther from the ob- ject than the witness. Another example would be that sounds or scents produced by the UFO may be detected by animals but not by humans. However, the human descrip- tion is all we have, so we must make the best of it. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS Taking the 104 sightings with ani- mal reactions collectively, the follow- ing six general trends are detected. General Observation l.-Nor- malcy of Animal Behavior: Wit- nesses to UFO events generally de- scribe normal animal behavior, not bi- zarre behavior. The witness describing the UFO event is also describing and interpreting the animal reaction. In that light, the animal reaction does not pro- duce an independent confirmation of the sighting. It does, however, serve as one check on the witness' observational abilities and accuracy. Witnesses generally describe very reasonable behavior on the part of the animal as UFO events unfold. With few exceptions, witness accounts were con- sistent with the sensory perceptions and normal reactions of the various animals involved. More simply, witness descriptions of the animals' behaviors make sense. For instance, in AR28 cattle and a dog are only reported as nervous and alert with no stampeding or barking as a near-ground, but distant (~1 mile), ob- ject was observed maneuvering by the witness. In comparison, AR46 reports that cattle were highly disturbed and bolt- ing away as a humming UFO neared the ground about 600 feet away, where it hovered before taking off. That day, milk production of these cows was re- ported to be reduced, a common bo- vine response to stress. This all makes sense in terms of the details of the sightings and the reactions of the animals. General Observation 2.-Common Reaction is Fear: Keeping in mind that animals that do not react or are calm are undoubtedly under-reported, the most common reaction of animals that is reported during UFO events is on the unease to fear continuum, with fear the most common. A study of wild animal reactions to the presence of humans and/or their vehicles demonstrated that these ani- mals react to the human intrusion in the same way they would react to a preda- tor (Frid and Dill, 2002). The study further states, \"Prey have evolved anti-predator responses to gen- eralized threatening stimuli, such as loud noises and rapidly approaching objects.\" My starting assumption was that ani- mals that react to UFOs would do so with a similar anti-predator-type re- sponse. In fact, this is the most com- mon animal behavior that witnesses re- port. Even predators, such as cats, can be preyed upon by larger animals, and thus demonstrate anti-predator re- sponses when feeling threatened. The 104 sightings in this report re- sulted in 135 observations of animal behavior. Of these 135 observations, 16 (12 percent) described animals as in- different or unaware. Of the remaining 119 observations, • 90 reactions were on the continuum of behavior from uneasy (6 reactions) to alert/alarmed (29 reactions) to fear (55 reactions). • The next most common reactions October 2005 MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"were animals that were unusually calm, interested, and/or wanted to approach the UFO (13 behaviors or 11 percent). One sighting is responsible for a number of these reactions. AR95 has a seemingly endless number of animals (goats, dogs, geese, chickens, cow, and horse), all described as \"unusually calm\" during the sighting. Thus a number of \"calm\" units of animal behaviors are generated from this one sighting, inflating this category. General Observation 3.-Relation- ship to UFO Distances and Maneu- vers: Sightings that involve animal re- actions tend to be relatively close en- counters with UFOs that linger and/or maneuver. Heaton (1976) notes that animals of- ten react when in close proximity to UFOs as did Rasmussen (1980), who reports close encounter sightings con- tain many animal reactions. Close prox- imity or close encounter is not defined. The sightings in this report support and quantify the close encounter aspect to animal reactions during UFO sightings. Altitudes in sightings in which ani- mals did react: Of 92 sightings with an animal reac- tion described, 81 had an estimated al- titude or a verbal description that al- lowed an altitude estimate to be made. For instance, \"treetop or housetop\" would put the altitude for that sighting into the 25-foot to 200-foot bracket. Of the 81 sightings with both ani- mal reactions and altitude estimates, 33% were below 25 feet, 70% were below 200 feet, and 90% were below 500 feet. The greatest UFO altitude associated with an animal reaction was 2,000 feet, and this was reported in two sightings. AR04 reported a large cigar-shaped object with windows and other details as it slowly moved from one cloud mass to another. AR102 reported a huge black triangle that moved slowly over- head. A dog was clearly frightened in the first case, and an older dog was re- ported disturbed enough to alter its be- havior in the second. Distances in sightings in which animals did react: Of 92 sightings with an animal reac- tion, 70 had an estimated distance. The much lower number of sightings with distance estimates compared to those with altitude estimates is because ver- bal descriptions were not helpful in es- timating distances. The verbal descrip- tions of distance are expressions such as \"beyond the barn in nearby field,\" \"among farm buildings ahead of the car,\" and so on. Without a map of the sighting area or further information, not even a rough estimate can be made. Of the 70 sightings with both an ani- mal reaction and a nearest-distance es- timate, 36% were overhead (relative to the witness and not necessarily the ani- mal), 59% were less than 200 feet away, and 79% were less than 500 feet. The greatest UFO distance associated with an animal reaction was AR02, where a horse reportedly spooked when a UFO was seen near a mountain peak 3-5 miles away. This distance is by far greater than any others with an animal reaction re- ported, and a reasonable guess is that the horse may have spooked at something much closer. Next farthest was in AR28 (UFO estimated 1 mile away), when a farmer's dog alerted him by whining, and his cattle seemed nervous. (Continued next month.) Graham Sheppard dies after long illness Graham Sheppard, 62, former Brit- ish Airways captain and long-time stu- dent of the UFO phenomenon, died Aug. 24 at Torbay Hospital, Devon, fol- lowing complications arising from my- elofibrosis, a chronic disease of the bone marrow. He was a close friend of Timothy Good, who in Unearthly Disclosure recounted Graham's alarming \"lateral displacement\" which befell him in March 1993 while flying a Cessna 172 in Puerto Rico. \"I shall miss him,\" says Good, \"not only as a close friend, but also as an irreplaceable principal research asso- ciate.\" MUFON Forum Dear Mr. Connelly, In the MUFON UFO Journal No. 448. you have published an article of Ted Phillips, page 18. This author quotes a so-called CE3 in France on 06/12/1790, near Alencon, \"from a re- port of June 17,1790, by Police Inspec- tor Liabeuf..\" I am sorry but this case is a hoax. Indeed, this story appeared the first time in an Italian UFO Review in 1966 by Alberto Fenoglio, but this man did not give the original French source. In 1970, Patrick Cubeau, who was living in the Alencon area, conducted intensive research in the library of the Archives Departementales of that town. He never discovered the least indica- tion relative to this event. An Italian correspondent, Pierlugi Sani, informed me that Fenoglio was not an ufologist, but rather a parapsy- chologist and an occultist, and not a serious researcher. I sent Fenoglio a letter in which I asked where he had discovered all the information about the Alencon case. He never answered. -Jean Sider UFO, black helicopters reported in southern France On Aug. 18, 2005, eyewitness Pierre L. reported, \"I witnessed at 7:25 PM over La Cadiere d'Azur, in the de- partment of Var (France), several black helicopters without visible markings hovering in the sky. \"They were present when a glossy cylinder rose from the top of the hill called Gros Cerveau. The object then changed direction while going horizon- tally from the level of the clouds to the north-northeast. \"Two black helicopters stayed hov- ering in the area for another ten or fif- teen minutes after the cylindrical UFO departed.\" On Aug. 19, 2005, at 7 PM eyewit- ness Gaspard W. reported a similar cy- lindrical object over the Alpes- Maritimes. The object was at an alti- tude of between 7,000 and 9,000 meters (23,100 to 29,700 feet). MUFON UFO Journal October 2005"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Secrecy, UFOs, and the death of the American Republic, Part 3 By Richard M. Dolan There is another, less appreciated, di- mension to UFO secrecy. These ob- jects, we know, have demonstrated amazing maneuvering capabilities. Some of them, at least, can acceler- ate instantly in all directions, turn on a dime, stop and hover motionlessly, and remain silent the whole while. Our military aircraft have been unable to compete. In 1975, UFOs that could hover like silent helicop- ters and move like silent jets Richard Dolan were unmolested by U.S. aircraft. In a well-known incident over Belgium in 1990, a triangular UFO thoroughly out- classed F-16 interceptors. During the summer of 2002, just outside Washing- ton, D.C., a UFO easily outpaced and outmaneuvered pursuing F-16s. A common question that arises is, what kind of propulsion system do these objects use. But I wonder, what makes them go? A matter of practical interest This question is more than academic. There are legitimate reasons to expect that we are about to experience a pe- troleum crisis of epic proportions, much sooner than we expect. Once a fringe belief, there are now many oil analysts who believe this. The problem is basic supply and demand. The supply is finite; the demand shows no signs of limit. In fact, global oil demand is now in- creasing at the fantastic rate of 4 per- cent annually, which translates into a doubling rate of every 17 years'. I don't care what your supply is, you cannot double demand of anything in- definitely, and certainly not at the rate the petroleum demand is moving. Recall the ancient Chinese story about the peasant who performed a good deed for the Emperor. \"I will grant October 2005 you any wish you ask,\" said the grate- ful Emperor. The peasant took a chess board and said, \"I don't ask for much. Simply place a grain of rice on the first square, then double the amount for each successive square on the board, and I will be content.\" \"Silly peasant,\" thought the Emperor. \"I would have given him something of value.\" For much of the board, the amount of rice was small enough. By the last few squares, however, the Emperor went broke. By the final square, the amount of rice would have exceeded all the rice in the world. Experts argue about when the petro- leum crisis will hit, but it is the height of folly to pretend it won't arrive. Whether it will be 50 years, 20 years, or 5 years, our civilization needs to find a way to replace petroleum. UFO tech- nology very likely holds part of the an- swer, maybe all of the answer. Some people agree with this assess- ment, and believe that the \"powers that be\" are simply holding out on us until the oil truly runs out, just to maximize their profit. Then it's free energy time- although we assume someone will find a way to make money from it. You had better hope that such blind trust turns out to be accurate. I'm less confident that a benevolent elite will bail me out at the eleventh hour. For all I know, they may have de- cided that there are too many of us on this planet anyway. \"Time to clean house. I' ve got my bunker. How about you?\" Freedom and Self-Governance For a democratically-based political system to function, there must be a rea- sonable amount of congruence between what people believe and what is actu- ally the case. You elect a member of Congress with the idea that he or she will repre- sent your interests within the nation's primary instrument of political power: the Congress. Except that Congress has been made irrelevant by other centers of power, or been taken over by them. MUFON UFO Journal About the Author Richard Dolan is the author of UFOs and the National Security State (2000), which covers the pe- riod from 1941 to 1973. He is cur- rently completing the second vol- ume, 1974 to the present. Dolan did undergraduate work at Alfred University in history, En- glish, and philosophy, earned a scholarship to Oxford, and did graduate work at the University of Rochester in political science. He has spoken at several UFO conferences, including MUFON's 2002 and 2005 symposiums, and has written for the Journal and other UFO publications. You get your news from television or your newspaper with the idea that the journalist on the other end is a kind of watchdog, looking out for the public interest. Except that the journalist is working for a corporation which is it- self antithetical to the public interest. Unseen structures of power have evolved over the previous generations, advancing sometimes slowly, some- times with a dramatic suddenness. But most people lack the conceptual means by which to understand what is hap- pening. As I have suggested, I believe that a significant part of that power structure involves the possession and exploita- tion of UFO-related technology. And I certainly believe that the secrecy has gone on for so long that it has become integral to keeping the whole system together. Once you start lying, how can you un-do the lie? Today, UFO secrecy has been with the U.S.-and by extension the world-for about sixty years. That's nearly as long as the Soviet Union ex- isted on the basis of its own labyrinthian web of lies. The comparison is apt. I still recall holding in my hands a commemorative oversized Soviet book celebrating the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"20th anniversary of the Bolshevik revo- lution of 1917. The book was published in 1937, during the depths of Stalin's rule. There was a colorized version of a famous photograph showing Lenin at a podium speaking to a crowd, and I noticed that Leon Trotsky-Stalin's great political enemy-had been airbrushed out of the picture. That's simply how the Soviet sys- tem worked. The government lied con- stantly, and everyone knew it, and ev- eryone in the country pretended that the government didn't lie. Constant lying in the Soviet Union meant that the official powers had to systematically think about how to or- ganize and manipulate public informa- tion to keep people in line. I remember trying to read through The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, an im- possibly organized mess of propaganda and fact so that you couldn't learn any- thing about anything that truly mattered. That's just how it was. Looking back, we can see how it would have been impossible for such a society to continue indefinitely, ruled as it was on the basis of a series of lies. Victim of own reforms When Mikhail Gorbachev took power in 1985, he wanted to reform that society. His catchphrases were glasnost and perestroika: openness and restruc- turing. I was a young student of Soviet his- tory at that time, and remember the excitement well. I also recall the skep- ticism of some of my professors who continued to believe for some time that this was yet another communist plot. No matter. Within six years, there was no more Soviet Union. What hap- pened? Well, one thing that happened, a big thing, was that the process of re- form spiraled out of control. You make a big change here, and the next guy wants change over there. It becomes hard to put on the brakes. You start with openness, for example, and you open the books on Stalin's gulag. You open the books on the particulars of the Bolshevik coup. Or the reconquest of the Ukraine in the 1920s, or the capture of the Baltic States in 1940, and on and on. Before long, entire subject peoples want to bolt, and many openly question the le- gitimacy of the Party's rule. Then it is over. Disclosure Scenarios It's no different today in America, and the UFO secret is at the core. Imag- ine if the President of the United States were to decide to end UFO secrecy. How would he do it? I can see him now. President George W. Bush steps up to the podium. Be- loved Vice President Dick Cheney stands behind him. Trusted lieutenants Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleeza Rice are there, too. The cameras of all the world's media are upon him. \"Good evening,\" he begins. \"Through a series of meetings with cer- tain senior scientific and defense offi- cials, it has come to my attention that the UFO phenomenon apparently is real, and is of extraterrestial origin.\" Silence. \"Hokey dokey, that's really all I have to say for now. We'll provide updates as we get 'em. I'm going on vacation for a while. Goodnight everyone.\" Well, maybe not. Disclosure is a pandora's box with a panoply of taboo topics just waiting to spring out. It is, as one friend of mine calls it, \"a sloppy tar-baby,\" a threatening, friendly, fright- ening, and inseparable bundle of un- avoidable eventualities. So I can imagine a few questions, even from a media as compliant as the American. \"Mr. President,\" one correspondent might say, \"what are the intentions of these aliens?\" Or, \"Mr. President, what does this say about the claims of alien abduction? Are they real, after all?\" Or how about, \"Mr. President, what about claims of underground alien bases? Or claims of secret possession of alien technology?\" These questions might not arise im- mediately. But they would arise even- tually. Once you open that lid, it will be very difficult to control the outcome. The answers would not be pretty. For this reason, I doubt that disclo- sure will come from America's politi- cal establishment. But there are always other countries. There are always the aliens. The truth is already here; it's simply waiting to land. After all, what exactly are the secret keepers protecting? Let's see. Power, wealth, control, their plans for the fu- ture, access to information, under- ground bases already built, the status quo. But there must be more. How about communication with aliens? Worm hole technology? Access to our genetic code? Or any number of technologies that we have not even begun to discuss openly in our society. Remember the statement of an Area 51 insider to aerospace journalist James Goodall-this was back in the 1980s- \"We have things in the Nevada desert that would make George Lucas envi- ous.\" In other words, Star Wars tech- nology. Can you imagine the front page of the New York Times following a true disclosure of all this? \"MASSIVE COVERUP EXPOSED.\" The biggest journalistic fiasco in his- tory would finally be acknowledged, wholesale resignations would sweep the intelligence community, a political third party would do a clean sweep of Washington. Congress would promise emergency hearings, Arab oil nations would be in a state of collapse as oil price futures plummet, and the stock market would be in a headlong tailspin. People would realize that a massive power structure has existed for genera- tions, and has siphoned away trillions of dollars. They would learn that it has played a dominant, though unacknowl- edged, role in shaping their lives. Think about NASA and the space shuttle program. There are no shortage of quiet discussions about the anti- quated nature of NASA's shuttle tech- nology. Astronauts have died because better technology was denied to them. And that is merely the tip of the ice- berg, for this issue goes far beyond NASA. Obsolete technology? No, people wouldn't be pleased or especially understanding. Heads would roll. The American system of govern- ment, as it has come to exist, and by extension American society, and by extension our current global civiliza- tion, is not compatible with true UFO MUFON UFO Journal October 2005"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"disclosure. Disclosure would rip it all away. You might argue that this would be a good reason to maintain the secrecy. On the other hand, I would argue it's the best reason for disclosure. As bad as things look today, I retain hope for a post-disclosure world. I re- tain a faith-yes, I guess it's faith-in the value of truth over all things. A statement by my favorite writer, Leo Tolstoy, hangs before me every day: \"The one thing necessary, in life as in art, is to tell the truth.\" I cannot believe that a society based on a foun- dational lie can be better than one based on a foundational truth. When the Soviet Union came to an end, people adjusted to face new prob- lems, but also new opportunities. We would have to do the same. Following the sense of betrayal, fol- lowing the frenzy of revelations, follow- ing the planetary chain reaction of scru- tiny and exposure, we might just awaken to a new world one fine morn- ing. A world in which the lies have been scrubbed away, and in which new truths are shining everywhere.

Witness reports UFO stops car along Denmark road by Kim Moeller Hansen MUFON Representative Denmark In his \"Account of Denmark as it was in the year 1692\" the English min- ister in Denmark, Robert Molesworth, wrote that \"in Denmark you will not meet any people with extraordinary abilities or qualifications. No one will distinguish himself by exceptional stud- ies or occupations. None is enthusias- tic, furious, mad or a dreamer. The Danes always keep to the beaten track.\" This description may be true today- so far as witness UFO accounts go. At least SUFOI (Scandinavian UFO Infor- mation, founded in 1957) has never been troubled by agonizing abductions, cattle mutilations, or similar alarming incidents. In most cases the reports we inves- tigate involve nocturnal lights and day- light discs-though once in a while a more interesting case will turn up, such as the famous car stop experience of police officer Maarup in August, 1970, which I reported in Evans & Spencer, \"UFOs 1947-1987.\" In 1995 we had another dramatic stopping of a car, where a very large disc with a powerful light hovered over MUFON UFO Journal the vehicle. This account of the event of Sept. 29, 1995, is based on the wit- ness' written report and the investiga- tion by Torben Birkeholm, SUFOI's field investigator in Jutland. It was Friday evening. 24-year old Claus Lundholm was driving south- ward from Brande towards Vejle in Jutland, on his way to visit his parents. He was driving a 1981 BMW 320. His only companion was a black Labrador lying on the back seat. There was hardly any traffic. It was dark with dry, clear weather. The ex- ternal temperature was over 10°C. Lundholm was approaching a left turn in a forest area. He slowed down and drove past a side road on the right that leads to Billund. As he turned, his speed was approxi- mately 60 km/h. The car's clock was showing 21.30, when suddenly he saw the speedometer shoot straight round to maximum and the other instruments started to go wild. The rev gauge also went to maxi- mum, and the thermometer shot up into the red, where the needle stood vibrat- ing. At the same time the windscreen wipers started going at great speed,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"though they were not even switched on! In bewilderment he tried flicking the wiper switch, but this had no effect. The dog started to become agitated on the back seat, and he had to tell it to lie down. As he approached a lay-by on the right he noticed that his headlights were also behaving oddly, changing in strength, and that the engine had started to misfire as though it was flooded. He tried to keep some life in it, and pumped repeatedly on the accelerator, but to no avail. \"The engine went completely dead...\" Finally the engine went completely dead and the car came to a stop-in complete darkness-out in the middle of the country road. While he nervously peered through the windscreen and glanced repeat- edly in the rear-view mirror, for fear of any cars that might be approach- ing, he tried immediately to re-start the car. He turned the ignition key, but nothing happened. The ignition light did not come on. There was no power. Everything was dead. However, he noticed that the car's clock was faintly lit. To his amaze- ment it was not snowing the time, but 88.88.88! He felt as if time had stopped as he tried several times to start the engine. \"There must be a small current if the light is on,\" he thought. But after three or four fruitless attempts he suddenly became aware of a strange, oppressive sensation \"from above,\" like some sort of physical influence that he found hard to describe. Apart from the restless dog, every- thing was completely quiet, and he looked around in wonder while he continued trying to start the car. Less than twenty seconds had passed since the first indication that something un- usual was happening. Light explodes over vehicle Without warning-and without a sound-an enormously powerful light practically \"exploded\" over the vehicle. The light came from above, and it was blinking or pulsing quickly at regular intervals. He saw the light through the windscreen, looked up and saw a huge disc above him. He was scared, but immediately opened the door, put his left foot on the road and leaned half- way out, his left hand on top of the door and his right hand on the steering wheel. His dog was whining and trying to hide, trying vainly to \"bury\" itself un- der the front seat. The light was dazzling, and he had to squint to see anything. He saw a large disc, 12-15 meters in diameter, just three or four meters above the car. The disc's outer edge was dark against the background of the starry sky. A little further in he could see a num- ber of concentric circles of light, which were closer together the nearer they were to the center of the disc. Each light-circle consisted of \"lamps\" that were equally spaced all the way around. Each \"lamp\" consisted of two circles, like a bulb in the middle of a reflector. The light itself seemed like neon, and each \"lamp\" shone as brightly as a halogen lamp. Near the center of the disc the light was so strong that he could make out no details, or see whether there was a single light source or a cluster of small ones. He observed that the light's boundary was very sharply defined, going straight down rather than spread- ing out to the sides as would be nor- mal. Consequently, the circumference of the light field on the ground corre- sponded to that of the disc above. Shortly after, as he sat back inside and shut the door, he saw that the light was now illuminating the whole road on both sides of the car, including the verges, though no further. As before, it was very sharply de- fined. The road at that point was wider than usual, as there was an extra lane for motorists turning off towards Billund. The color of the light was white and indigo, somewhat reminiscent of the light from a welding torch, but not nearly as strong. It \"quivered\" in a strange fashion. The light gets dimmer and the disc moves Lundholm rolled down the window and put his arm and head outside. He looked up again, though keeping a look- out for any cars coming from behind, turning his head rather than using the mirror. After a short time he saw that the intensity of the light was slowly dimin- ishing, as if someone were operating a dimmer. Soon it was as weak as a car's indicator light, but it continued to blink or \"quiver.\" Through the windscreen he saw that the disc was slowly moving forwards ahead of him. He could see that it was not flat. It looked peculiar, with some- thing like \"triangles\" or \"spikes\" which he estimates were approximately one third of the disc's diameter, or about three meters high. The outer edges were rounded off, like a parasol.lt carried on towards the trees nearby, still very low down, and as it reached the first trees it literally had to \"tip\" its left side up to avoid them. It carried on with a faint light and disappeared out of sight in a matter of a few seconds, still without a sound. The disc had tipped its left side up by at least 20 degrees, and he could see the underside at the same time. He could not tell whether it righted itself again before it went out of sight. For a short while he simply sat in the car, trying to calm his still agitated dog while he collected himself after what had happened. After maybe three or four minutes he turned the ignition key to check if there was any power. The headlights came on and he noticed straight away that the digital clock stood at 21.31. He turned the key completely. The engine started immediately. Lights and instru- ments were functioning normally. He was still feeling afraid-his legs were trembling-but he drove off. For a while he did not drive over 70 km/h, but he speeded up when he had calmed down a little. After driving 35 km he reached his parents' home and immediately told them what had happened. The experi- ence was still affecting him, and he was shaking. His parents asked him to con- tact someone-there must be some \"UFO people\" he could ring. But he was too frightened and upset and did not phone anyone. Later, Lundholm told a friend about 10 MUFON UFO Journal October 2005"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"the experience, who likewise urged him to report it. He thought the matter over a lot, but could not bring himself to con- tact anyone till some weeks later he saw a Danish TV documentary about UFOs. A few days afterwards he phoned SUFOI. SUFOI immediately sent him a re- port form. When SUFOI got it back, it was clear that it dealt with a Close En- counter of the Second Kind. A meet- ing was arranged, and SUFOI recorded a lengthy interview. The local press was used to trace witnesses to the incident. SUFOI re- ceived a number of responses from lo- cal residents regarding various sightings, but there was no \"star wit- ness\" who could be tied in with the car's stopping. One sighting, however, did occur the same evening, only a few kilometres from where the car stopped. Around 19:20 two individuals were standing in the farm kitchen. The woman was standing facing the win- dow which looked out over the farm- yard. Suddenly a beam of light ap- peared from above and shone down onto some flagstones in the yard in front of the window. The beam of light was very sharply defined and around one meter in diam- eter, as was the area where it hit the flagstones. The light beam did not move, and after about five seconds the woman drew her friend's attention to it. He was standing with his back to the window, but turned in time to see the light for about three seconds before it vanished. The duration was about ten seconds in all. The farmyard is surrounded by high trees, so the couple excluded things such as light from neighboring proper- ties as an explanation. They did not go outside. It was obviously not possible to tie this case in with the car stopping, as there were several hours between the two incidents, and the second light beam was much smaller. But this too was an interesting sighting, and the co- incidence of the two events on the same evening may be significant. Duration of the sighting How long did the young man's en- counter last? In his original written re- port Lundholm stated that it lasted 30 seconds, maybe longer. During the interview he was asked to state the duration of each phase of the incident. Later he was asked to close his eyes and recall the events while being timed. Without being told the result, he was asked once again to close his eyes and try to re-live each phase in turn. He originally stated an overall duration of at least 30 seconds, while his phase- by-phase account indicated a good minute. We may reasonably suppose that the true figure lies somewhere between 30 and 60 seconds. Is that a little or a lot? Try timing it yourself-a lot can happen in that time, and a great number of de- tails can be noted. The witness Claus Lundholm lives in Aalborg (northern Jutland), where in 1995 he was a student nurse. He originally comes from around Vejle, where he has many acquaintances who interest them- selves in the UFO phenomenon in their spare time. He has himself heard about UFO sightings, read about them in newspa- pers-not books-and seen TV programs on the subject. He has also seen the film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" He comes across as a surprised and honest person who gives no impression of being other than very normal. Lundholm has spoken further about his thoughts in connection with the ex- perience. He especially noticed the strange \"oppressive\" feeling just before the light appeared. In a way it was like just before a thunderstorm, but very physical. Just as the light appeared he noticed a sort of \"pleasant\" feeling that he has never experienced before. He was scared, but nevertheless did not feel \"threatened\" in any way. He did not feel it was anything that wanted to harm him. While the object was present it seemed as though \"time stood still\" in the space where the light was. At the same time it was unbelievably quiet. He found it striking and totally incom- prehensible that there was not the slightest sound, despite the enormous \"machine\" hovering just above him. He also felt as if he should \"go up.\" In any case he imagined that it might happen, but the thought did not frighten him. In fact he hoped that more would happen-that \"someone\" or \"some- thing\" would come and show itself to him. He wanted to know what it was, and felt in some way \"drawn\" to the disc above him. While it was there Lundholm did not notice any sort of heat from the intense light. On the contrary, he felt a sort of \"coldness\" (it was also chilly outside), which he could compare a little to a feeling from his hospital work. He had recently been on practical training in a department with an NMR scanner (which produces a powerful magnetic field). There one feels that one's body seems to be registering something unusual. He imagined in fact that the powerful light was taking some sort of \"photograph\" of him. Case is not closed SUFOI has not succeeded in tracing other witnesses through the local me- dia. We have considered ringing door- bells in the area, or using the national media in the hope of finding a motorist from out of the area, who might have noticed the light or even the \"disc\" from a distance. Furthermore we need answers to a number of technical questions concern- ing the car. It would be interesting to define the physical conditions which might cause the instruments to behave as described. For example, what level of current is required to activate the digital clock, and under what circumstances will it show 88.88.88? The car should have been examined by qualified technicians immediately after the incident. Unfortunately this was not possible, due to the time that elapsed before SUFOI became in- volved and because of the cost. As work on the case has progressed, a number of questions have arisen. The young man has made himself available to SUFOI throughout the investigation, and it is only the fact that the investiga- tors must use their spare time that is delaying bringing the case to a full con- clusion.

Reviewed by Deborah Lindemann I found Raechel's Eyes to be one of the most compelling books I've read in many years on the mystery of UFOs and \"alien beings.\" As a UFO re- searcher and clini- cal hypnotherapist for 20 years, I don't say that lightly. Al- though the writing style is uneven at times, it is a gripping book that reads like science fiction. I found it entertaining and educa- tional, and I felt almost disappointed when I reached the end. Not just another UFO book, this is allegedly the true story of a young hu- man-alien hybrid female named Raechel who was rescued in a crash retrieval by the military in 1969 at Four Corners, in Nevada. She became part of a plan or experi- ment to integrate hybrids into regular society as part of the \"Humanization Project.\" I remember first hearing of this hy- brid woman around 1991while practic- ing in California. At that time I simply filed the story away in my \"gray\" bas- ket, unsure if it was based on reality or was simply a fabrication of someone's mind. Now, 14 years later, her story is published. The first half of the book skillfully weaves a detailed mosaic of the lives of those who were touched by Raechel and came to know her. There was Harry, who joined the Air Force in 1955 as a young man desper- ate to escape his unhappy home life, who quickly and unexpectedly found himself promoted to major at a clan- destine \"non-existent\" base known as Four Corners. He could never have pre- pared himself for what he would be exposed to there, from extraterrestri- als working alongside the military to meeting Raechel. Then there is Helen Littrell, whose memories form the basis of the book. The reader travels with Helen through many personal trials and tribulations, from breaking out of an abusive mar- riage to discovering her role in this amazing story. Helen is the mother of Marisa, an intelligent and caring young college woman, blind from diabetes, who be- comes the roommate to Raechel through a quirky set of circumstances. An unusual bond is formed between them with roots that connect them in a most unexpected way. And there is Raechel herself, a young hybrid woman who just doesn't fit in. Crash landing to earth, she is a sole survivor. Harry finds her in the rubble of a crash and, surprised at their instant bonding, personally takes on her sur- vival and well-being. Four Corners becomes Raechel's new home for the next three years. There she is coached and nurtured by both military personnel and Chisky, a small gray-hybrid and resident alien scientist, in charge of cloning and cell propagation. Chisky served as both an interpreter and mediator between arriving aliens, human-alien hybrids, and humans at the base. Raechel's appearance was so differ- ent from humans: her slender, slight built body only 5' 4\" tall, her skin a yellowish-green, with wispy hair and huge green slanted eyes that contrasted her paleness. She became part of the \"Humaniza- tion Project\" with the approval of ATIC (Aerospace Technical Information Cen- ter), coached to take on human traits and trained in cultural integration. Part of that experimental integration involved enrolling her into college and finding a roommate who wouldn't no- tice or suspect her unusual appearance. Marisa fit the bill. Throughout her brief time in public while living with Marisa, Raechel was forced to disguise her unearthly appear- ance, covering her head with scarves and wearing huge wrap-around glasses everywhere she went. Raechel found it increasingly diffi- cult to cover her identity. Her behav- iors did not fit those of a typical teenager's interests like Marisa's. Then there was the matter of her strange diet that would soon be discovered by Marisa. Raechel began to feel a deep sad- ness over not fitting in, and her ability to feel became a detriment for her safety and success. That went beyond the ex- periment. The second half of the book reflects the extensive research done on this case, including interviews with those who met and knew Raechel and Marisa by journalist/author Jean Bilodeaux, and highly detailed hypnotic regressions of Helen by Dr. June Steiner. I've had the opportunity to know Dr. June Steiner, and I have found her to be a fine, competent, and caring thera- pist and hypnotherapist. The transcripts from her sessions with Helen reprinted in the book bear that out. Dr. Steiner helps Helen recapture details from Helen's memories that will leave the reader with many surprises, twists, and turns that few could predict, including Helen. Toward the end of the book, the au- thor also shares a useful outline of projects and agencies, and their acro- nyms associated with the management and secrecy of this subject matter. For anyone wanting to understand more about the possible reality of hu- man-alien hybrids, this is an important 12 MUFON UFO Journal October 2005"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"book to read.

Hall, Foreward by Rob Swiatek, Fund for UFO Research, P.O. Box 277, Mt. Rainier, MD 20712, 8 V* x 11, soft cover, 48 pages, $8 + $2 shipping. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Journal editor This is a follow-up edition to the first edition, which chronicled UFO sightings from 2000 to May of 2003, and which was published in 2004. This new edition picks up the sightings in May of 2003 and brings them up to June of this year. As Hall points out, these sightings have not necessarily been thoroughly investigated. In this respect they are similar to re- ports in Filer's Files, and most come from Peter Davenport's Na- tional UFO Re- porting Center (NUFORC). These reports, says Hall, basically answer the ques- tion of whether UFOs are still being sighted, and whether their characteris- tics have changed over the years. The answers are \"yes\" they are still being sighted, and \"no\" their charac- teristics have not changed noticeably in the new millennium. That is, they are still being reported as cylinders, cigars, discs, ovals, and ellipses; they still hover, rapidly accel- erate, dart, and make sharp turns; and they still have body lights, light beams, and bright illumination. The basic structure of this booklet is UFO Sightings in the New Millennium ~<®_ Sietard H. Hall a chronological listing of sightings ac- companied by a very brief description, followed by a separate section in which details of each sighting are presented. Hall follows this with a separate sec- tion on \"mystery triangles\" which deals with 119 specialized cases not covered in the previous sections. This section includes very brief summaries of the sightings. Hall notes that reports of triangular craft average two per month, and that \"exactly contrary to what one would think if the craft were experimental U.S. government devices, the sightings were far less frequent in places like Nevada and the Southwest, and most frequent in the more populous Midwest and South.\" Sightings of triangular craft were reported in 36 states and five Canadian provinces, with California the most fre- quent (13), followed by Ohio (8), Illi- nois (7), Pennsylvania (6), and Florida (6). Night sightings (6 PM to 6 AM) predominate by a ratio of 10 to 1. According to the reports, triangular craft show a strong pattern of being de- scribed as black/dark objects that dis- play lights at or near each apex of the triangle (usually not blinking) and of- ten another light at the bottom center. They tend to fly low and slow (often hovering), appear to be very large, of- ten fly edge forward as opposed to point forward, and are usually silent. This is a very useful compilation of reports by a respected researcher. A UFO miracle?

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Journal editor As the line between religion and UFOs become more and more blurred, it is inevitable that \"religious\" events, such as the 1917 incident at Fatima, Portugal, will be reevaluated. The au- thors have spent 25 years studying this series of sightings of what has been widely accepted as the Virgin Mary, and their research has been meticulous. They have dug through all sorts of records, including statements over the years by the individuals involved, as well as conclusions by those interpreting the sightings. Interestingly, the key witness to this series of events, Lucia dos Santos, 10 yers old at the time, re- ferred to the lady sighted only as \"a very pretty lady,\" but not as \"Our Lady.\" Because of the unusual \"light- ning\" and other \"heavenly lights\" asso- ciated with the incident, and the fact that the being said she was \"from the sky,\" people with a limited view of the world quickly assumed that the \"very pretty lady\" must be the Virgin Mary. The authors conclude, \"The paran- ormal became the supernatural, and the supernatural became religious.\" The book deals extensively with the similarities between various UFO re- ports and the Fatima sightings, as well as with other sightings somewhat simi- lar to Fatima, such as Lourdes in France. Other than the sightings of the \"very pretty woman,\" there were also reports of the observation of three beings \"in the Sun,\" as well as reports of sounds, odors, wind, clouds, miraculous cures, and other phenomena. The authors compare these reports with similar re- ports from UFO incidents. While there is no index, there are ex- tensive notes, as well as tables and il- lustrations. Those interested in the possible re- lationship between UFOs and religious events should find this extensively- documented book quite interesting.

Both my PA UFO Hotline and the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) have been receiving reports of strange ob- servations in the sky. I have received information concern- ing alleged Bigfoot activity occurring in some locations as well, and the PA Bigfoot Society (PBS) has also been in- vestigating some possible Bigfoot en- counters. As is usually the case, the UFO sightings and Bigfoot sightings were not at the same time and location, so ap- parently were not related. Following are the two Bigfoot cases reported thus far: Westmoreland County-I received a report from a witness who reported seeing a creature which fits the descrip- tion of a Bigfoot. The sighting took place on Jan. 2, 2005, at a rural loca- tion along the Chestnut Ridge.The in- cident occurred about 6:30 P.M. It was almost dark, but enough light remained to be able to see for a dis- tance. The witness, who was visiting a local family, was loading up his vehicle for a return trip to his home. His attention was drawn to a field across the road, about 40 feet away, by a loud crashing sound and the noise of brush breaking. The man crossed the roadway and looked around, expecting a large buck to exit the area. Moments later, he noticed to his left, about 100 to 150 feet away, a very large man-like figure moving through the field. He was able to get a good look at the creature, which he estimated stood between 7 1/2 and 9 feet tall, was dark brown or black in color, entirely cov- ered in hair, and walking erect. The witness could see that it had massive arms which hung down to the knees, and swung gracefully as it walked up the hill. The head of the creature seemed to be cone-shaped and no neck was observed. The witness indicated that the crea- ture continued on its path, and at one point seemed to look towards him, but 14 never changed it's pace. What impressed the witness was how fast the creature was moving up hill in the nearly dark conditions. It was covering a large amount of ground in its strides in a short time. When the creature reached the hori- zon, the witness could see its shape clearly with the light behind it. The creature moved into a tree line and was lost from sight. The witness, an avid sportsman who had heard stories about such creatures in the area, but until now had never ex- perienced anything like this, observed the creature for about a minute to 90 seconds. Elk County-The Pennsylvania Bigfoot Society (PBS) is investigating a possible Bigfoot encounter in Elk County which occurred on Feb. 14, 2005. A man and his two sons were driv- ing in their vehicle on Route 555 near the town of Benezette, PA. The fellows were driving to their hunting camp when at about 11 AM they reported observing a tall creature standing along the road. It was covered in dark hair, and had reddish eyes The family was astonished by what they saw, and after passing the crea- ture, turned back to take another look. The creature had apparently entered the woods and was not seen again. MUFON UFO Journal Oct. 9-Las Vegas, UFO Awareness Day, Nevada MUFON.

Family frightened in Illinois WESTMONT — A neighbor re- ports, \"Tonight my next door neighbor came to my house around 8:30 PM and told me that she was very upset! She informed me that last night, which was Aug. 24 & 25.2005. she had been kept awake all night by orbs of light floating around in her basement and her bed- room. \"She had been complaining the month before of this same thing, and her husband even experienced some- thing pulling the covers off him while in bed! \"Last night her daughter had the feel- ing that someone was sitting on her chest about 4 AM. Her daughter finally ran into her mother's bedroom and told her Mom to move over, as she wasn't going to continue sleeping in her room! \"The daughter is 18 years old, and going off to college soon, so she is not a little girl afraid of the dark! Last week the mother even said she saw what she calls The Green Men.'\" Possible abduction in Florida MUFON's Mary Zimmer reports, \"On Aug. 2, 2005, the witness called, saying that he had just awakened and was very, very thirsty, even after drink- ing several bottles of water, and wanted to tell me what happened to him. \"He said that at 1 PM he watched about ten minutes of the news broad- cast and had an overwhelming urge to go out into the back yard. He saw an orange light above the retention pond in back of his yard. \"He said that the object that he saw was the same one that he saw over the Gulf, but it was straight across, not October 2005 George Filer tilted, and about 200 to 300 feet in the air. It was like a straight bar and pointed at the end, but it may have been a disc. \"The surface was orange, pulsating, beautiful, flowing like water. There were three squares, then a space, and then three more squares. It looked so large that he estimated that it could be covered by a blanket unfolded. \"He saw it for about 45 sec- onds, and then it completely van- ished. The night was silent with even the crickets not making noise. He found it hard to get back inside the house, and made some noise coming back, but did not awaken the others in his house. \"He called me at 3:52 AM, but 'thought it was earlier, about 1:20 AM.' There was missing time of two hours and forty-two minutes, during which apparently an abduction took place. \"Thomas became very thirsty after this, quickly drinking four or five 16 oz. bottles of water. He later suffered from vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to urinate. None of his neighbors had seen the object. On Aug. 4, he noticed a slight burn- ing sensation on his chest and discov- ered a small red triangle just below the skin. His doctor didn't know what it was, but didn't think it was anything to worry about. \"The doctor did find that his triglyc- erides were dangerously high, 410 (nor- mal 40 to 200), and said that he could be at risk for a stroke or heart attack. The doctor also found that his electro- lytes were extremely low, and advised him to drink PediaLite and to eat only fruit and vegetables. The witness was fearful of a little girl MUFON UFO Journal with dark eyes in the doctor's waiting room, because her eyes made him afraid, as did people who wore sun glasses. \"The family had gone to Cape Canaveral to see the space shuttle re- turn. At a lunch with the astronauts, Thomas' niece asked about drinking Tang. The astronaut said that they no longer drink it, but use a different for- mula because they had found that weightlessness caused a decrease of electrolytes in the human body.\" -Thanks to MM Zimmer and MUFON Case Management System.

Tennessee disc JACKSON — On Aug. 27, 2005, the witness spotted a disc-shaped craft around midnight. He states, \"My friends and I saw it when we were playing outside. It was very scary. It just hovered above us for about 10 seconds. It took off, and a couple of minutes later we started feel- ing lightheaded.\" (NUFORC Note: Witness elects to remain totally anony- mous; provides no contact information. PD) Dominican Republic black UFO INEXPLICATA—At 12:50 PM on Aug. 29,2005, the witness saw a com- pletely black UFO at an altitude of be- tween 1,000 and 3,000 meters. The witness states, \"I say this be- cause the object flew between a low rain cloud and medium altitude white cloud. We know that rain clouds are usually at an altitude of between 1,500 to 2,500 meters.\" \"The object was traveling east, and its shape was something like the alleged 'flying humanoids' seen in Mexico over recent months.

Thunderbirds have accident More than two million people at- tended the Chicago Air and Water Show, and some spectators claim they saw a UFO just prior to the Air Force Thunderbirds precision flying team F- 16 fighter jets touch during their flight on Aug. 20, 2005. The mishap sent a missile rail from one of the aircraft plunging into Lake Michigan about 2,500 feet from spec- tators on the North Avenue Beach. The shaken Thunderbirds canceled their aerial performance only 15 minutes into their 45-minute routine. Nobody was hurt, and the six Thunderbird aircraft safely returned to the Gary Jet Center. The show for Sun- day was also canceled. The falling missile rail shown in a photo strangely appears as a cylinder- shaped.object that may have been mis- taken for the UFO. High-speed choreo- graphed stunts that bring wings as close as 18 inches apart are inherently dan- gerous, particularly when UFOs show up to observe. A similar air show in the Ukraine in- terrupted by a UFO caused the deaths of over a hundred spectators. Also, a UFO penetrated a group of World War n fighters over Goodwood, England, on Sept. 6, 2003. UFOs at Chicago air show? The witness reports, \"While on the water in a friend's boat on Aug. 21, 2005, during the early portion of the Air and Water show in Chicago, as a MIG banked in the air we looked up to see what at first looked like a silver orb hanging near the smoke trail from the MIG. \"The object hung there, and while the five of us all watched, 1:30 to 3:30, we noticed it spinning and looking like it was morphing from a round object into two objects, but still remaining at- tached and rotating end over end. As it rotated we could see the sun shine off the object at first as an orb shape, but then it seemed to show the texture of two orbs stuck together. \"It hung, and although there was some wind, was definitely not a bal- loon, plane, or bird. The sky was nearly completely clear. You couldn't miss the silver dot in the sky. Eventually it dis- appeared in front of our eyes after about seven minutes. \"Later during a separate jet perfor- mance, I looked up in a different part of the completely empty blue sky to see a glowing silver orb which seemed to hang for a little longer, slowly getting smaller as we assumed it was gaining altitude. \"There was a Chicago police boat right next to us, and we pointed and showed them the location. They both (a male and female occupant) saw the object and watched with us. \"We told them of the previous expe- rience, and they seemed to have no ex- planation of what we were looking at. I am more than sure some of the over one million people got video of this event. It was pretty amazing.\" Florida flying stadium lights SARASOTA — A large round ob- ject with \"stadium lights\" flew over two cars on July 21, 2005, at 10:02 PM. The witness states, \"My fiance and I were driving separate cars when we both noticed an extremely fast-moving object going south across the road we were on. \"My fiance called me on my cell phone to verify what we saw. We turned down a small unlit road south towards our home when we both noticed an as- tronomical-sized object just hovering literally right above our cars with beam- ing 'stadium lights' shooting down at the road. \"I looked in the rear view mirror, and suddenly it was gone. We both got on the cell phone again to verify what we saw. \"We looked on your website and found that there was another sighting here in Sarasota on May 29, 2005. -Narrative from William Puckett's Report from \"UFO's Northwest\" and UFO Roundup. Australia missing time RAVENSHOE, QUENSLAND — On July 19,2005, at 3:30 AM, Dina Holdcroft was driving on a lonely coun- try road in the far north of Australia's state of Queensland when strange things began happening to her. \"All at once I heard unusual sounds on my car radio,\" she reported. \"My mobile phone kept receiving messages, so I picked it up and said, 'Hello?' But there was no response. \"Suddenly, there was a light all about the car, and the engine cut out for a split- second, then came back on, very pow- erful, like the battery was fully charged. An illuminated mist came all around the car. \"I heard a sound like 'Whhiiiiiiiiiirrrr.' And that's all I re- member. I had lost half an hour.\" New York discs FARMTNGDALE — It was Sunday, Aug. 28,2005,7:40 PM. A family was in the back yard. The son was talking to his girlfriend and states, \"I looked up and saw what looked to be a star. The sky was still bright, and no other stars were out. \"An aircraft at 34,000 feet passed overhead, heading north, leaving a trail behind it. The object was in back of the trail. I have video. The UFO stayed in one spot. \"What was odd is that when the air- craft passed by, leaving its contrail, the contrail broke where the UFO was. However, the rest of the contrail was still there. Our neighbors also saw this. \"We used binoculars and a telescope to get a better look. It was a bright dif- ferent type of white light coming from this object. Then my neighbor spotted another one to the left of the first one we saw. \"They were both moving extremely slow, heading west, and stayed in for- mation until we lost sight. It took 30 minutes for both UFOs to get to the horizon.\" -Thanks to Peter Davenport. 16 MUFON UFO Journal October 2005"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Physical Traces By Ted Phillips Occupants and physical traces I have chronologically traced some of the numerous reports of traces in conjunction with occupants. This month we will look at the 1960's. Argentina 10/21/63, 2130, Argentina, Trancas-A disc-shaped object was seen by an entire family and ser- vants for several minutes. There was animal reac- tion, EM effects, and occupants seen. The disc diameter was es- timated to be 30 feet. A \"cloud\" was seen over Ted Phillips the site for four hours, and a powerful smell of sulphur floated over the spot. A cone-shaped pile of small white balls which crumpled under gentle pressure were found inside a circle 28 to 30 feet in diameter. Analysis by Dr. waiter Gonzalo Tell, Institute of Engineering, University of Tucuman, showed that they contained 96.48% calcium carbonate and 3.51% potassium carbonate. Carob trees in the area were all with- ered in a few days. France 07/01/65,0540, France, Valensole- M. Masse was in his lavender field lighting a cigarette when he heard a whistling sound. He could not see the source, as he was standing behind a mound of rubble which was 6.5 feet high. He stepped out from behind the rubble and saw an oval metallic object resting on a central shaft and six thin legs. It was about 18 feet wide with a round cockpit. Two small beings were standing near the object. He walked to within 35 feet of the beings before they saw him. One of the beings pointed a tube at him and he could not move. The beings had bodies the size of an 8-year-old child, but their heads were three time the size of a normal human head. There was no hair, the skin was smooth and white, and they wore coveralls. The mouth showed no lips, and looked like a hole. After a short time, the two returned to the object and entered it through a sliding door. The object jumped into the air with great speed, and moved away at an angle of some 45 degrees with a whistling sound. Suddenly, at a distance of 65 feet, the object completely vanished from sight. Masse was unable to move for an additional 15 minutes. Plants along the flight path were damaged for 325 feet. At the site were marks consisting of a shallow basin over 1 m in diameter, at the center of which there was a cylindrical hole 18 cm in diameter and 40 cm deep. There were also four shallow grooves, each 8 cm wide and 2 m long, which formed a sort of cross having the cylindrical hole as its center. The earth at this spot was densely packed.\" Missouri 05/00/66, MO, Whiteman AFB -I learned from security personnel at the base that a disc-shaped object was seen to land in a wooded area on the base by several children. They immediately told their parents, and security teams were sent to the area. They found a burned area and four imprints. The children said the object came down vertically through the trees, landed, and a small being emerged. They ran. Tree limbs were broken from the tops down into the area. I talked with nine security people, some of whom had seen the site, which was roped off for some time. I did lo- cate the base photographer (then re- tired), who said he had taken many photographs of the site. He did not keep any negatives or prints. Iowa 01/29/67, 2200, IA, Knox City- Mrs. Enid Campbell saw from a win- dow what she thought at first to be the full moon. As it moved closer she could see it was a spherical object, white in color like a frosted light bulb, with a shiny gold horizontal ring around the center in which there were numerous round holes. The object came up to within sev- eral feet of her window before stop- ping. Through its semi-transparent material she could see a panel with a lever on top and two occupants, one seated at the panel, the other standing. They wore shiny, silvery \"wet suits.\" She called her sons, Gene, 18, and George, 14, who arrived at the window in time to see the object as it rose and moved away. While it hovered nearby, two smaller white luminous spheres approached the object and entered through an opening, after which the holes in the central ring jetted out red fire. Then the object ascended vertically and disappeared. The snow on the ground under the spot where it hovered was melted, and the area over which the object approached the house failed to produce plants, while plants else- where grew normally. Missouri 02/14/67, 0700, MO, Tuscumbia- Farmer Claude Edwards, 67, was walking toward a barn when he noted that his cows were all looking toward a point in the field to the east. He saw, through scattered trees, a circular greenish object, curved at the top, with a flattish bottom. He could see numerous openings around the lower rim, with brilliant light coming from inside the openings and constantly changing colors. He walked to within 15 feet of the October 2005 MUFON UFO Journal 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"object, which was resting on a cylin- drical central shaft, and encountered a \"pressure\" he could not get through. The object was 18 feet in diameter and about 6 feet thick. Under the objects were numerous small beings of a greenish color mov- ing rapidly around. He backed up about 10 feet and watched from 25 feet. With the sun ris- ing and the area fully illuminated, the object rocked back and took off at a low angle. There was no sound. At the site I found a circular depres- sion which was dehydrated and baked, although the surrounding soil was wet and muddy. There was a hole at the cen- ter of the depression into which a de- vice had apparently been inserted. France 07/17/67, 1500, France, Arc-sous- Cicon-Four children saw a small black creature which ran from them. They tried to follow, but lost sight of it. Later a patch of grass 14 feet wide was found where the grass was burned. An odor was noticed. Small footprints were found. Idaho 11/02/67 2130 ID, Ririe-Two 23- year-old men saw a landed object 6 feet wide and 4 feet high, with a dome and holes around the center. A small occu- pant was seen. Their car stopped as they approached the object; ground traces were found. Brazil 11/24/67, 1430, Brazil, Copaca- bana-Ugo Battaglia, 39, and a boy heard a high-pitched sound and saw a bright, metallic disc come down, hit a tree, and hover. Three men in white coveralls walked around the area. The boy later suffered severe headaches. Circular ground traces were found. Argentina 07/02/68 1130 Argentina, Sierra Chica-Oscar H. Iriart saw two men of normal size near an elliptical, silvery object, about 21 m long. It had three 50 cm legs. The man's horse and dog were paralyzed for several minutes. The object took off vertically at great speed with flashes of light. The man arrived home \"like a mad- man.\" Inspection showed three holes which had gone into the ground 12 cm, forming the pattern of a perfect isosce- les triangle. Brazil 08/00/68, Brazil, Brazilia-A woman saw a dark triangular object land gently and silently within 10 m, \" and caught a glimpse of an occupant. Marks forming a triangle of 2.1 m x 1.2 m x 1.2 m were found at the spot. Spain 08/16/68, 0600, Spain, Tivissa, Tarragona-A man and his wife saw a mushroom-shaped device hovering 3.5 feet above the ground. It was giving off considerable light. On the other side he saw two beings about 300 feet from the object, running towards it. They were about 3.5 feet tall, and light in color. Watches stopped three times at the site. A large area of burned grass was found. Brazil 03/15/69, Brazil, Lins-Maria Cintra, a nurse's aide employed at Ferreira Clemente Hospital, was about to go to sleep after night duty when she heard a sound like the brakes of a car outside her window. She looked out and saw in the court- yard what appeared to be a white woman of about 30, strangely garbed in a cape and tunic of some shiny ma- terial, bound at the waist with a heavy metal belt. \"I called out to the woman, inquir- ing if she was a patient desiring admis- sion, but there was no reply,\" said the witness. \"I dressed hurriedly and went out- side. The strange person walked away from the building just as a machine re- sembling a huge plate floated from the air to the ground. \"A being inside the machine opened up a hatch, the woman entered, and the machine went straight up in the air. Then I began screaming.\" Marks were found on the ground were the object had settled. The Bra- zilian Air Force took soil samples, and Hospital Director Prata said grass had ceased growing on the spot. Iowa 04/10/69 IA, Clayton County-A sphere was seen to land and to direct a beam of light at each of the young wit- nesses. Two beings, 3 feet tall with long arms, wearing white suits with large yellow-brown helmets, were seen. Many sets of marks were found, with one set, as of landing leg imprints, found within a scorched circle. Canada 07/01/69 0620 Canada, Olds-Fred Yoos heard a clattering sound which shook the building for a few seconds. The 62-year-old man looked out a win- dow and saw a large, green, oval ob- ject descending from a dense cloud to theNW. It hovered just above the ground 50 feet away. The rising sun reflected off the window-like opening in the object, and he could detect the movement of two figures inside. The object was 20 feet in diameter and ascended vertically. A deep depression was at the site. Colombia 07/04/69, 2000, Colombia, Ano- laima-Two children saw a glowing object 300 yards away. They sent flashes from their flashlight toward the object as a signal to it. It quickly moved in their direction and stopped less than 200 feet away. They called to the family and were joined by 11 others. The father moved to within 20 feet of the object. It was dark except for the top section, which was illuminated from within. The father pointed his flashlight at the illuminated section and saw a small person. The entire device became illu- minated and flew away. In less than two days his health was taking a turn for the worse. His body temperature dropped, and blue spots were visible all over his body. In seven days he died of \"gastroenteritis.\" Iowa 09/07/69 1400 IA, ElkaderA boy saw an object take off in a pasture south of the barn. A clear landing mark was found. Iowa 09/08/69 1800 IA, Elkader-Land- ing, occupants, and traces reported 5 feet from the 09/07 site, having the same size and leg pattern. Iowa 09/09/69, 1500, IA, Elkader- Farmers report seeing small beings and object; traces were found. 18 MUFON UFO Journal October 2005"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PERCEPTIONS By Stanton T. Friedman Phil Klass gone As almost every reader of the Jour- nal must know by now, Philip J. Klass (1919-2005) has died after a battle with cancer. He had been incapacitated for a few years after a problem with his back and some surgical effects related to his voice. He had given up on his Skeptics newsletter a few years back. I have been aware of Phil for more than 35 years. We had a lot of corre- spondence, did a public debate at Trin- ity University in Texas, and several battles on television and radio. We even had a few pleasant meals together agreeing not to talk about UFOs. There are some good things to say about Phil. He worked very hard at his UFO debunking. In fact, I believe that he was one of the most successful pro- pagandists of the past 100 years. He almost singlehandedly convinced two generations of scientists and jour- nalists that there is nothing to UFOs that he couldn't explain. Most were too busy or too lazy to bother investigating any cases that hit the press and were happy to leave everything in Phil's hands. He had a huge correspondence with a large number of scientific ufologists. Dr. Bruce Maccabee has commented that his correspondence with Phil about the very significant New Zealand sight- ing of Dec. 21, 1978, covered about 1,200 pages alone. He was a master of false reasoning and personal attacks on people, epito- mizing my third rule for debunkers (in- spired by Phil): \"If you can't attack the data, attack the people.\" He inspired rules number one, two, and four as well: Don't bother me with the facts, my mind is made up: what the public doesn't know, I am not go- ing to tell them; and do one's research by proclamation, investigation is too much trouble. Phil often claimed that he put his money where his mouth was. Not re- ally ! He would make silly offers to pay so much if One obscure, but typi- October 2005 Stan Friedman cal example, was to offer me a certain amount of money for every document I could find in which Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, CIA director 1947-1950, used the unusual date format of day, month, comma, year (used in the Eisenhower Briefing Document) if I would pay him for every ex- ample of his use of a more conventional style such as day, month, year. Of course I didn't take him up, as I had never con- tended that RHH always or usually used the un- usual format. I had an example of such a use. We were involved in two financial transactions. Many years ago he had offered $10,000 if anybody could pro- vide evidence that the President or Na- tional Academy of sciences would say proved that UFOs were of ET Origin. He only required $100 per year for 10 years vs his $10,000. I shocked him by pulling out $100 in cash on the old Lou Gordon TV talk show in Detroit and publicly handing it to him. I paid my $100 each year for 10. Supposedly the agreement is still in effect, though I haven't looked at it in years. He, of course, had put no money on the table. One agreement between us on which he did pay off was his challenge (it wasn't a wager) that since the typeface on the famous Cutler-Twining memo of July 14,1954, was done in the large pica type, it must be fraudulent, as he had nine memos from the National Se- curity Council (the CT memo mentions the \"NSC/MJ-12 Special Studies Project\") all done in small elite type. MUFON UFO Journal He generously offered to pay me $100 each for every genuine memo or letter from the NSC in the right time frame, and meeting certain criteria, that used the same size and style pica type. This was to provide an incentive for me to respond quickly for an article he was planning on writing. He set a limit of 10 items for which he would pay. He sent copies of his challenge to many people. Typical of Klass, he had never been to the Eisenhower Library and received his 9 by mail. I immediately went to my filing cabinet and pulled out 20 dif- ferent pica type samples. I knew most didn't meet his criteria, but was plan- ning a trip anyway. He kindly accepted 2.    - By that time I had been to Abilene, KS, and had copies made of 14 items which did meet all his criteria. I had previously noted that at least 3 differ- ent typewriters were in use at the NSC. I sent the examples and an invoice for $1000. He paid it promptly, but didn't tell anybody about paying off. I did-even including a copy of his check in my 105- page \"Final Report on Operation Ma- jestic 12\" for the Fund For UFO Re- search, along with the relevant corre- spondence. This upset him very much. So I can say he paid his debt. But it indicates his total lack of concern with real research. The Ike Library has 250,000 pages of NSC material: The notion that one can extrapolate from 9 to 250,000 is typical of the in- tellectual bankruptcy of the pseudo-sci- ence of anti-ufology. If there were only 100 NSC documents and the same typewriter was used for 99, one might say that one expected the 100th to have been done on the same typewriter. But from 9 to 250,000???. In the style of all specialists in disinformation and misinformation, Klass often made great leaps in faith following the rules noted above. In the Japan Air Lines case of Nov. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"17, 1986, over Alaska, he concluded that what was observed by the pilot and crew of the 747 was really Mars and Jupiter...certainly ET \"bodies,\" but not alien spacecraft. He apparently wasn't aware of the radar observations of a large object near the plane by both the aircraft crew and by a radar system on the ground. With permission from the ground, the plane flew a circle, and the object kept with it and was observed on the ground ra- dar. The pilot described the object as twice the size of an aircraft carrier. None of this critical information was included in the press release that he sent out far and wide. Obviously Mars and Jupiter cannot be tracked by radar, and they certainly can't accompany a 747 flying in a circle. Dr. Bruce Maccabee and Dr. Richard Haines had spoken to Pilot Terauchi, through an interpreter. Klass had not. In the obituary for Klass in Florida Today, the following statement is high- lighted: \"In nearly 30 years of search- ing, investigating famous sightings, I have yet to find one that cannot be ex- plained in down to earth prosaic terms,\" as though it was true. In fact, every large scientific study of UFOs shows it is nonsense. For ex- ample, a special UFO subcommittee of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics noted that 30% of the 117 cases examined by the U. of Colo- rado Study (The Condon Report) were found to be unexplainable. I have noted many times in print from \"Aeronautics and Astronautics\" to \"Physics Today\" to my Congressional testimony, that 21.5% of the 3201 sightings evaluated by Battelle Memo- rial Institute for the USAF Project Blue Book in \"Project Blue Book Special Report 14\"could not be identified, com- pletely separate from the 9.5% listed as \"Insufficient Information.\" Not surprisingly Klass doesn't men- tion BBSR 14 in his books, though he was well aware of it. Klass often tried to sound scientific, as in his discussion of plasma phenom- ena or ball lightning explaining away many sightings. He ignored the possibility of the ion- ized air plasma being adjacent to the object seen and part of a magnetaerodynamic propulsion sys- tem. Jim McDonald, an atmospheric physicist, demolished his argument. Klass went after Jim with a vengeance and made viciously false claims about him to the Navy people running the at- mospheric physics study contract Jim had. So far as I know, Klass never apologized for this Sen. McCarthy type attack. Carl Sagan blindly accepted Klass' attack on the MJ-12 documents, say- ing (in Demon Haunted World), \"The Air Force says the documents are bo- gus and UFO expert Philip J. Klass and others find lexicographic inconsisten- cies that suggest the whole thing is a hoax.\" The New York Times obit stated, \"Mr. Klass applied careful reasoned analysis to what is often a very emo- tional topic, as he repeatedly found ex- planations for saucer sightings in natu- ral phenomena and manmade objects. He used details like the typefaces on documents to question the veracity of what some contended were deliberately covered up government documents.\" Never mind that Phil paid me for his being wrong about the lexicographic work and that his explanations couldn't stand scrutiny. There is much more about Klass and Sagan and their unenlightened, often completely false, claims about UFOs and MJ-12 in my book TOP SECRET/ MAJIC (2 nd Edition now available with a new chapter updating the testimony of the defense; see http:// www.stantonfriedman.com) and in my \"Update on Operation Majestic-12 Documents\" on the website. There are many other examples of Klass' false propaganda about UFOs. We were instructed not to bring any- thing with us into a TV studio in De- troit. After we were in, Phil pulled out a clipping from his pocket. A favorite tactic was to try to misdirect attention from the matters at hand. He pronounced on one show that I must not be convinced that some UFOs are Alien spacecraft because I hadn't submitted an entry to Cutty Sark Scotch which would pay a million dollars for any evidence of that. I had to waste time pointing out that the rules were clear. If I provided a fly- ing saucer, to be kept by them, and cer- tified by the National Academy of Sci- ences, the prize would be awarded. Of course I had never claimed to have one or even a piece of one. If I did, it would be worth far more on the market. He had the gall on Larry King with Dr. David Jacobs to claim that all the so-called abductees in David's book had mental health problems, though he was in no way qualified to reach such a conclusion-and Dr. John Mack, who wrote the foreword, was. Klass admit- ted, in response to a direct question from Larry, that he had not even read the book! Obviously, this raises the question of was he making all this effort for kicks and because he sincerely believed the trash he wrote, or was he working for some agency as a potent disinformer? I cannot prove he was working for a government body. But two different people have quietly noted to me his presence in cleared facilities, such as the CIA and Air Force Intelligence. It seems very likely he was officially con- nected. The Church Committee back in the 1970s revealed that the CIA had been using journalists for years to report on their contacts with cold war opponents, about comments at international con- ferences, and probably about loose lips on the part of American scientists and engineers. Klass would have been an ideal choice. He had training in electrical engineering, and he worked for a well known and respected Washington- based publication, Aviation Week and Space Technology. He was unmarried until he was 60 (we were supposed to have a debate in NY, but he got married instead, pre- sumably not just to avoid the debate.). He was a very fast typist, excellent writer, technologically sophisticated with all kinds of contacts, and traveled widely. Who better to report on activi- ties of interest and to disinform? I am glad his physical suffering is over, and suspect he is laughing in his grave, proud of his service to the pow- ers that be.

Author Donates Books to MUFON For Fund Raising to Support MUFON Projects Florida author and MUFON mem- ber Edgar John L'Heureux, Jr. has do- nated 100 of his best-selling books to MUFON to use for fund-raising pur- poses, and has promised more if we need them. While they are not UFO books, they are interesting, exciting, and well-writ- ten, and are enjoyed by a broad audi- ence. MUFON is offering multiple copies of these books to state directors, state section directors, and local groups to use for fund-raising at the local level as well as at the national level, sharing equally in the proceeds. All of Ed's books make nice holiday and birthday gifts, and are especially nice to give to someone you care about- and they are all autographed by the au- thor. Details on the distribution of these books are forthcoming. Titles of the books include: A Table Set for Guests, Tunes Above the Noise and other short stories, The Clay of Vases and other short stories, a novel To Lullaby a Dragon, Florida Con- versations II ramblings and sketches, and Florida Conversations ///literary sketches about Florida. I have read each of these books and find them intriguing and enchanting. We thank Ed for his generous gift.

Grant Cameron denied entry to U.S. Popular symposium and conference speaker Grant Cameron has been re- fused entry to the U.S. He was sched- uled to speak Sept. 4 at the National UFO convention in LA. \"I flew to Vancouver,\" says Cameron, who lives in Canada, \"and at that point was refused entry into the United States by US Customs-Home- land Security. The officer was very ugly about the whole thing. \"The ruling was that I was lecturing for a fee, and not an honorarium. I there- fore did not have the proper work au- thorization required by Customs. This has never been imposed before. When I mentioned this, officer #2740 stated 'We will not be making that mistake again!' \"The 'notice of ineligibility for Pre- Flight Clearance' was issued by inspec- tor 2740 with the US Department of Homeland Security-Customs and Bor- der Protection.\" The violation was Jisted as section 212 (a) (5) (A) You appear to seek to engage in skilled or unskilled labor in the United States without having a US Department of Labor Certificate. \"When I mentioned I was being paid an honorarium, he told me not to go there. It was only for professors, 'and you're not one.' The presentation I was to give was '64 Reasons Why the Gov- ernment Thinks It Has to Cover up.' \"A very expensive experience. Some tell me here I will have a hard time get- ting in the States from now on.\" October 2005 MUFON UFO Journal 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Hall resigns from board of Fund for UFO Research Veteran ufologist Richard Hall has announced his resignation as a board member of the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR). \"In the future,\" he said, \"I will de- vote far less of my time to the subject, and that will be in other places. My reasons for this are too complex to explain in a short message, but basi- cally I think FUFOR is moribund. \"Speaking as a founding member and past chairman, FUFOR currently is being poorly led, is out of touch with the pulse of the field, and has lost its focus on the central mission that it was established to accomplish. I regret hav- ing to say this.\" He continues, \"In recent years Rob Swiatek, as secretary-treasurer, has been trying to carry an impossible load while employed full time in his profes- sional job, and he has been primarily responsible for the one good thing that FUFOR has accomplished in recent years: production of some very good publications that, unfortunately, few people are aware of. \"Due to apparent poor leadership and abysmal communications, the Fund web site seldom is updated, does not include the information on most of the new publications, and Fund supporters no longer receive regular quarterly re- ports as they are supposed to. Except for those publications, the Fund has al- most nothing to offer anymore.\" Hall says he will continue to publish the Journal of UFO History, post on his web site, www.hallrichard.com, \"and occasionally chime in\" on the Internet, \"mostly to express my dismay at the demise of any semblance of real 'ufology' in the sense of scientifically oriented, careful, critical assessment of data. \"I propose an annual award for the most gullible ufoologist of the year.

For northern hemisphere observers, Mer- cury will not be visible. For southern hemisphere observers, Mercury will be visible until midmonth low in the west- southwest during evening twilight. Venus: In Sagittarius. For northern hemisphere observers, Venus will im- prove in visibility. By mid month Ve- nus will set more than 2.5 hours after the Sun and will stand about 10 degrees high in the southwest just before the end of evening twilight. For more favored southern hemi- sphere observers, Venus will set more than 3.5 hours after the Sun and will stand about 25 degrees high in the west- southwest at the end of evening twi- light. Mars: In Aries. For northern hemi- sphere observers, Mars will rise in the east-northeast before sunset, will stand about 60 degrees high near 11 PM, and set during morning twilight in the west- northwest. For southern hemisphere observers. Mars will rise in the east-northeast about 1 hour before sunset, stand about 45 degrees high near 11 PM, and set during morning twilight in the west- northwest. Bright Planets (Morning Sky) Jupiter: In Virgo. For northern hemisphere observers, Jupiter will, by month's end, stand about 10 degrees high in the east-southeast at the begin- ning of morning twilight.

For southern hemisphere observers, Saturn will rise near midnight in the east-north- east and will stand about 35 degrees high in the north-northeast at the be- ginning of morning twilight. Other Celestial Phenomena Meteor Showers South Taurids: The South Taurids will peak on Nov. 4-7, but some may be seen anytime from Oct. 20 through the end of November. The South Taurids have a peak rate of 12 meteors per hour, or about one every five min- utes on average. The peak of the South Taurids will occur just two days after the New Moon, which should assure a darker sky for better viewing. Leonids: Peaking on Nov. 17. The Leonids is probably the most famous meteor shower of all. This year's Leonids will offer an interesting twist, however. There will be not just one shower, but three. The first arrives Nov. 13, and the last is on Nov. 19. Sky watchers in nearly all locations on Earth will have a chance to see at least one of the showers. The Leonid radiant rises usefully only around local midnight; the Moon will be one day past full phase,so will inter- fere greatly with observance of the Le- onids this year.
