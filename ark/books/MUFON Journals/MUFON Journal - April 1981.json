FROM THE EDITOR The Cash-Landrum case reprted here appears to be an especially significant case of physiological injury caused by a UFO. Since this preliminary report was written, more medical evidence has been obtained indicating clear-cut radiation injuries of a presently un- known nature. The possibilities include ionizing radiation or micro- wave radiation. Investigation is proceeding and a follow-up report will be printed as soon as possible. Readers have responded heavily to Stuart Campbell's UFO hypotheses article (No. 156, Feb. 1981), and we will begin printing letters of comment and rebuttal statements in the next issue.

Two women and a young boy suffered various degrees of injury, largely attributable to radi- ation poisoning and radiant heat, after watching a luminous object hover low over the road ahead of their car. MUFON Deputy Director, John Schuessler, and members of Project VISIT are investigating. They are seeking to obtain the full set of medical records. Betty Cash, 52, was driving her 1980 Cutlass Supreme from New Caney to Dayton, Texas, on High- way 1485 about 9:00 p.m. With her were a friend, Vicky Landrum, 60s, and Vicky's grandson Colby, 7. Suddenly a luminous, fiery-looking object descended to treetop level over the road ahead of them and they heard a beeping noise that persisted throughout the sighting. From its underside, flames (red- orange) were emitted toward the road periodically, with an audible \"woosh.\" Betty stopped the car, afraid to drive beneath the object; they opened the car doors to stand beside the car and watch. The glow was brilliant, and they could feel strong heat and hear a loud roaring noise. Colby became terrified and he and Vicky got back in the car, but Betty remained outside for a longer period of time. (Probably signif- icantly, Betty's injuries were the most severe.) Finally, the object started to rise and move away to the right in a southwesterly direction with a large number of helicopters (20 or more) seemingly in pursuit. The evening was cool and the car heater had been turned on, but now the car was so hot that Betty turned on the air conditioner. Later Betty dropped Vicky and Colby off at their house and drove home, feeling ill. She arrived home at 9:50 p.m. Numerous symptoms appeared almost immediately: swollen neck, head and facial blisters, swollen earlobes, and swollen eyelids. Her eyes closed completely and she could not see for several days. Four days later, unable to eat, and suffering nausea, vomit- ing, and diarrhea, Betty entered the hospital where she remained for 15 days. She also suffered severe loss of hair. After being discharged, she continued to suffer swellings, head- aches, and lack of appetite. A little over a week later, she returned to the hospital for additional treatment. As of February 22, she remained constantly tired, headachy, and unable to work. When they arrived home that night Vicky and Colby also felt ill; Colby's face was \"sunburned\" and he had eye problems, a condition that still persists to a mild degree. They spread large quantities of baby oil on their faces for three days. Both had stomach aches and diarrhea for several days. Vicky experienced some loss of hair and a sensation as if her scalp were \"asleep.\" During the sighting, she had placed her left hand on top of the car, and the fingernails on that hand showed odd line-like indentations across their width. Colby had nightmares for 2-3 weeks, and since has displayed ex- treme anxiety and fear at the sight of a helicopter. The large number of helicopters itself poses a mystery, since no obvious source of that many helicopters is known in the area, especially on short notice if they were pursuing the UFO, as they \\ General appearance of Huffman, Texas, UFO appeared to be. The date also was during the holiday season when military bases typically would be on \"stand-down\" with reduced personnel. Although they remain to be fully documented, the medical symptoms suggest both radiation sickness and physical burns; both ultraviolet and infrared radiation may have been involved. Full details will be report- ed as soon as the investigation is completed, and trie future health of the witnesses will be monitored."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"UFO REPORTS FROM CHINA (Three articles published in November 1980 in Dagong Bao of Hong Kong received by Stanton T. Friedman December 23, 1980 from Xinhau News Agency, New York, NY. Translated by Joseph Tin- Chong Yiu.) Seguin, Texas 1. It has been reported recently that China has successfully obtained a photograph of an unidentified fly- ing object, known by some people as \"flying saucers.\" This may be the first time that any picture has been taken in Chinese territory. How- ever, the earliest record of a \"UFO\" recorded by the Chinese can be dated back to 1056 A.D. It was recorded that an object as bright as the sun with a golden line at its center appeared at the providence of \"Young.\" The more recent report is from a science student. He reported \"On December 25, 1979 (night), my friend \"Lim Young\" and I were studying and the time was 8:00 at night. The sky was clear. We saw a bright fireball about 26\" in diameter at the horizon where the sun norm- ally sets. The color was almost bloody red with the perimeter ap- pearing white. I said to him \"Have you seen a moon like this?\" and he said \"No, that is not a moon. It is a sun.\" I replied \"At this time? It is impossible.\" The object picked up tremendous speed and rotating anti- clockwise headed in pur direction. It changed to an elliptical shape as it got closer to us, and rotated in various directions. The object finally got smaller as it flew past us, and the reddish color disappeared. The en- tire process lasted about 5 seconds.\" 2. It all happened on September 23, 1978. There were several hun- dred air force personnel watching a movie in open air at Jin Sho. The time was 8:04 p.m. All of a sudden an object with two big head lights ap- peared 6,000 meters above them. The object also had a big bright whitish taill, moving at an incredible speed. The size was very big, oc- cupying about 35 degree of vision. 4 3. Another report is from Mr. Cheung Chou Shun, an astronomer. On July 26, 1977, at 10:00 p.m. he saw a bright spiral object with yellowish center. The brightness was about that of a class 2 star. Extending from the center to the outer perimeter were circles of spirals. The rings were bluish in color. The number of rings were about 3 to 4. The object was about a 60 degree angle above the horizon. The object moved in a straight line with the horizon. Five seconds later, the object disappeared. There are various reports from different walks of life in China concerning UFO, mostly in recent years. The area of sightings is widely ranged from dif- ferent provinces. It may seem strange that all of the reports are mostly after 1977. This is because until then the research and activities had not been permitted. It was con- sidered \"crazy\" or \"ridiculous\" to suggest UFO existence. It is hoped that we can catch up with the west- ern world and solve this mystery together. CORRECTION We sincerely regret that in the January issue (No. 155) the review of a major UFO publication (Ency- clopedia ofUFOs) failed to include the name of the reviewer. The name was accidentally dropped off in the printing process. The reviewer was Isabel Davis, alternate to the Execu- tive Committee of the Fund for UFO Research, former staff member of the National Investigations Commit- tee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), and former member of the Research Committee of CSI of New York. Given her extensive background in the UFO field, the review loses force without knowing who wrote it. We suggest you write in her name in the blank space where it should have appeared at the conclusion of the review. MAJOR KEYHOE JOINS MUFONBOARD By Walt Andrus It is a distinct pleasure to an- nounce that Major Donald E. Keyhoe, U.S.M.C. Retired, has been elected to the Board of Directors of the Mutual UFO Network as Director of Government Affairs. Major Keyhoe is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and the Marine Corps Officers School. He retired from the U.S. Marine Corps in 1945 at the end of World War II. He served as Director of NICAP, the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, from 1957 to 1969. As a pioneer in UFOlogy, he is best known for the books he has au- thored; Flying Saucers: Top Secret, The Flying Saucer Conspiracy, Flying Saucers From Outer Space, and his most recent, Aliens From Space. Richard H. Hall, Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, was privi- leged to work with Major Keyhoe as Assistant Director of NICAP during the period when NICAP was the world's largest and most active UFO organization. Don and his wife Helen receive their mail at P.O. Box 502, Luray, VA, 22835. It is an honor to welcome this' distinguished gentleman to the MUFON Board of Directors."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE ANDERSON EVENT By Donald Roberts (Acting MUFON State Director) (Note: Assisting in the investigation were Wanda Jones and Margaret Pine; Allan Hendry investigated for the Center for UFO Studies. All quotes are taken verbatim from the interview taped on Sept. 14, 1980, with Jerry and Faye McAlister. Tape available for statement verification). On a warm, clear night in early September of last year, Jerry McAlister, 40, was listening to the report of a wreck on 1-85 on his police scanner at his home in Anderson, South Carolina. His wife, Faye, 34, was sleeping beside him in the couple's baclobedroom, their five daughters asleep across the hall. McAlister, an electrician by trade, had been laid up with a broken ankle and listened often to sideband and C.B. transmissions as a hobby. At 4:20 a.m., September 11, McAlister was suddenly startled by an extremely loud noise coming from his backyard, described as \"like a helicopter crashing,\" and, accom- panied by a \"high pitched whine.\" That same moment, lights \"bright enough to light up the entire back yard, the house, and everything\" flooded through the windows. McAlister got his crutches, moved to the bedroom window and, looking up, saw what he described as a brightly lit object as \"high as a two story building,\" and roughly 70 feet in diameter, hovering approximately 50 feet in the air, and over a group of pines in his back yard. At this point, McAlister awakened his wife with one of his crutches and called her to the window, where- upon she remarked, \"Oh, my God, how beautiful/'and went to wake their daughters. Only the oldest, Shirley, 17, arose and returned to the window with her, in time to view the object still hovering. The object was described as having a row of very bright, white, stationary windows across the center of the structure, with a row of even brighter white lights rotating hori- zontally in a clockwise morion around the perimenter. (See sketch.) There was additionally, an oscillating, or \"wobbling,\" motion of the entire object, revealing \"grayish-black steel under the windows\" when it tilted upwards, this angle diminishing the extreme brightness. McAlister said it appeared to be made of \"slick metal,\" and, was seamless. His wife stated that she saw black between each window, and, all three complained of the lights hurting their eyes during the observation. ooooo\" At this moment, the horizontally rotating lights around the object's perimeter tilted to a vertical position, like a ferris wheel, the windows remaining horizontal as before. The \"flying saucer,\" as McAlister described it, then \"went like a streak of lightning — the sound left, and everything.\" He estimated that the entire afore- mentioned sequence of events, described exactly as was told during the interview, lasted approximately 3 minutes. As the object rapidily moved off, to the NNE, McAlister, his wife, and five daughters, all of whom were now up, left the house through the carport door, turning on the outside light, the first turned on during the occurrence. They all watched from the yard as the receding lights came to a stop at a distance estimated by McAlister to be approximately 8 miles, this having been covered in roughly 2 to 3 minutes. Secondary Events And Witnesses For the next 2 hours and 45 minutes, until 7:05 a.m., the object remained at its distant location, and was viewed by a number of people, these including the seven members of the McAlister family, four next door neighbors, two from several miles away, and, four deputies of the Anderson County Sheriff's Department. The deputies, who had been called twice by the McAlister's before their arrival, watched for 2 hours, 10 min- utes through binoculars and a 60-power telescope provided by one of the neighbors. Everyone present had ample opportunity to view the objects through both instruments. McAlister and his wife stated that the windows and rotating lights were still plainly visible and that the wobble was the same as before. The light was still bright enough to hurt his eyes, even at that distance, said McAlister. In fact, he stated that they were \"so bright, they still blinded you!\" During this entire period, McAlister said that the object was gradually rising in the distance until 7:05 a.m. when, as he put it, it \"shot out of sight and, was gone — a beautiful sight.\" Deputies' Comments The four Anderson County Deputies who witnessed the event had various statements to make on their observations of the far-off light source. Mike Burton said that he observed the object rising and turning con- stantly for over an hour, but, could (Continued on next page) 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Anderson, continued) not make out a definite shape. He also said that he observed it changing colors from red, to hazy blue, to bright white, and to yellow! He stated that he thought it was not an aircraft, and, that the object was smaller than the moon, but much larger than a star. Rock Nation said that he didn't know what it was, and Lt. Joseph Simmons was an observer but has not been questioned as of this writing. The Department contacted the local Anderson Airport and Greenville Aviation, a little after 5:00 a.m. while the event was in progress, but neither was open. However, the Greenville- Spartanburg Jetport was, but Air Traffic Control there said that radar noted nothing unusual. A strange note involving only one of the Deputies (who, it is not yet clear) and McAlister's daughter Shirley concerns the observation of a red light, or lights, coming out of the bottom and top of the object. Shirley saw hers on the bottom; the Deputy saw his on the top. McAlister said that the Deputy kept saying he saw red lights, though no one else, save Shirley, did. (Further statements and compar- isons, whether of significance or not, are made here, in the event of their possible future use in this case, or others.) One of McAlister's more interest- ing comments, at least to this investigator, was that there was no question in his mind that, as soon as he initially saw the object, he knew that it was a \"flying saucer.\" How he arrived at this conclusion so rapidly is anyone's guess. He also stated that he wasn't scared, just thrilled by his experience. Saying that he had never believed in UFOs, he interestingly added that his wife's sister did, and that she had read extensively on the subject, and had told him and his wife all about UFOs prior to their sighting. McAlister also said that he knew it was not a balloon, helicopter, nor any type of known aircraft. As to the extreme loudness of the initial encounter, described as like a \"helicopter crashing,\" and \"loud as a helicopter starting to take off,\" he had no explanations as to why such a noise didn't wake his wife or children, though his ears \"roared\" for 3 days afterwards. From the distance of 110 measured feet from his bedroom window, it must have been awesome, indeed. The next door neighbor described what he heard as a \"muffled\" sound, and the cross-street couple said they were awake at that hour yet heard nothing at all. McAlister said his dog, which was sleeping at the foot of McAlister's bed, didn't bark during the incident, as he could recall, though in the excitement, he wasn't sure. Questioned as to any time loss, either by any individual or clock, there was none, McAlister stated. Physiologically, in addition to the previously mentioned effects of the bright lights and intense sounds, McAlister complained of a \"terrific headache\" all the next day with swollen glands in his neck through the day after that, and burning, reddened eyes. As for the burning eyes, it must be considered that McAlister had been up for a consid- erable time both prior to and after the event. A possible EM effect occuring after the event was over, was that for 7 hours, according to McAlister, no modulation (transmission) could get out on his C.B. unit, though his signal was detectable by others. He could receive normally, but only a buzz came through when he attempted to transmit. Further, McAlister's antenna was located almost directly under- neath the object's position in his back yard, and if his estimates of its altitude are correct, only a few feet away from its bottom. The factor of Venus in its relative position at the time of the object's distant hovering is another interest- ing aspect of this case, as it appeared to rise as Venus did and was only approximately 15 degrees away from the planet's position at the time. Both were visible until approximately the same time that morning when they were lost in the brightening sky. When questioned about these facts, both McAlister and his wife were sure that Venus was to the right and below the object and was con- siderably brighter. Radiation arid S.B.I. S.B.I., or the \"Scientific Bureau of Investigation,\" based out of New York, and represented by Pete Mazzola, a N.Y. police detective, and Jim Pillow, a retired New Jersey policeman, descended on the scene the day after the event, calling it one of the best documented cases they had come across. Apparently involved to some degree with the popular \"That's Incredible\" T.V. program, they brought a PSE \"lie detector,\" and some type of geiger counter, leaving behind many more questions than the event itself caused. McAlister, himself, said that they checked his eyes with a pen-light type flashlight, detecting a glazed effect, and called it \"radiation burns.\" No qualified medical personnel had yet, however, checked anyone for anything at the time of this interview several days later. Various reports of the McAlister's themselves being radioactive by some vague amount, and even in- creasing that radioactivity, sometime later, as well as radioactivity con- siderably above normal background levels in the back yard, surfaced after S.B.I.'s visit or visits, whatever the case may be. Mazzola was quoted in one news article as saying that there was a \"decided jump on the geiger counter.\" Thanks to Allan Hendry of CUFOS, who, upon hearing of all this, brought a counter to the site, he and .this investigator finding no levels higher than background, though our readings were made, in all fairness, 3 days after the event. As for myself, I found the state- ments made concerning all this somewhat less than agreeable, having worked in nuclear weapons for several years in the U.S. Army and having undergone extensive training in radiation handling and detection procedures.

Abducted by a UFO. That it could happen in fact would have been unthinkable until some 30 years ago (and still is for per- haps a majority of us) and if it occurred in fiction, only the most courageous story-tellers dared en- visage it. Yet here we are, sober citizens of 1981, seriously sitting down and considering the possibil- ity that dozens of alleged abduction reports could be based in reality. We know the pattern. The ab- ductee is walking or driving along, or even sitting at home, when there's this weird compartment; his hosts what he's doing and go to investi- gate; he meets these weird people who take them on board this weird craft of theirs, where he is put into this weird compartment; his host give him some kind of physical examination, then let him go, telling him he won't remember a thing. But he does, if not consciously then under hypnosis. We've read that account, or something like it, so many times that we'd hardly be sur- prised if it happened to us and (Anderson, Continued) As of this writing, it has been relayed that \"That's Incredible\" has visited the McAlister's twice now, with one national T.V. airing already. Information concerning additional sightings in at least five different locations and towns later the same day as the original will be forth- coming as soon as logistically possible, including statements from a number of persons involved, supporting the McAlisters' description of the object. would surely experience a sense of deja vu as they laid us on their inspection table. And yet, we still don't know whether stories like that have any basis in fact. Charles Fort believed in explan- ations. His four books, though they contain many attacks on scientists who conducted themselves non- scientifically, are monuments to the scientific method. Yes, you may say, and look where it got him: four fat 'volumes packed with anomalies still awaiting explanation, the biggest pending file of unsolved mysteries outside of Scotland Yard. If that's the scientific method, some say, we'd all be better off sitting at the feet of some Eastern guru, trying to imagine the sound of one hand clapping rather than trying to find cause-and-effect patterns in phenomena which are manifestly outside the scope of human reason.. It's possible they're right, that there are some areas of experience which aren't amenable to logic-systems that we're acquainted with. But that's a - desperate conclusion to come to; before that, we need to be convinced that old-fashioned cause-and-effect thinking has failed us. Personally I don't think we're anywhere near that point. What scares people off is the seeming paradoxes inherent throughout the UFO problem, and found at their most extreme in the abduction reports. But Charles Fort delighted in paradoxes because he recognized that when you've re- duced a problem to a paradox, you've got to the heart of the problem. I suggest, and I think Fort would have agreed with me, that it is precisely the outrageous character of the abduction reports which gives us *Fortean Times, 9-12 St. Annes Court, London Wl, England ($10/yr) our best hope of isolating their true nature. A Clue On 26 July 1978, 37-year-old \"Gerry Armstrong\" was hypnotic- ally regressed to when, as a 12-year- old schoolboy in England, he was taken aboard a UFO and examined by its occupants. His account is more or less the standard scenario out- lined above, but from what he said under hypnosis I note the following: In a room. . .ain't no electric light bulb. Can't see a bulb.. .1 can't see any bulbs. And then one go through the wall. 1 didn't. . .can't see a door. And later, going over the mat- erial in the wakened state, he said: I'm being put in a room. . .1 think it's a room. I'm trying to under- stand where the light is from. It's very, very interesting. We seem to walk through a wall, but there must have been a door. 5 - 7 In 1977, 40 year-old Betty Andreasson was hypnotically \"re- gressed to when, 10 years earlier, she was taken aboard a UFO and sub- jected to a number of astonishing experiences during a sequence of events which largely conformed to the standard model. From her ac- count I note: B: Whoosh! Another door opened. And you can't even see those doors. They just go up when they open. Q: Can you see the source of the illumination? B: It comes from all over the place. Q. Can you see any welded seams on the wall or some type of seam? B: No, it seems smooth all the way around."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Archetype, Continued) Let's check the tape at that point and ask ourselves, why do the lights and the doors seem of such part- icular interest to both subjects and, consequently, to their questioners? An answer is that doors and lights are things which all human homes and vehicles possess, so they're something we can relate to in an alarming situation. But so are lots of other things: why, when something so extraordinary as going on board a UFO is happening, do such trivial details loom so important? Personally, I'd be interested enough to go aboard Concorde, let alone a UFO; but I can't imagine my chief concern would be for the lighting system. Yet, it's a fact that this preoccupation is almost a standard feature in abduction reports. Antonio da Silva (Brazil 1969) reported, \"... the lighting in the compartment was intense, of the mercury vapor type, but he was un- able to detect any sources for the light, nor any openings or salient parts on the smooth surfaces.\" 23 Antonio Rubia (Brazil 1977) found himself in an interior lit by an intense blue light which came from the ceiling, but he couldn't determine the source because it seemed to come from the ceiling as a whole. 1 And so on, and so on. All I want you to note, for the moment, is that so many witnesses pick out this parti- cular aspect of their experience. The lights and door things are only two of many; they just happen to be the ones that set me thinking, the clues that led to the question which is the starting-point for this inquiry: Why do the abductee's reports—not their experiences, but their reports —echo one another so closely? Four Kinds of Report Reports of alleged encounters between humans and non-human entities fall into four classes: 1. Stories told by real humans who describe what they allege, and seemingly believe, to have really happened to them, in which they met \"I think we must accept that there is a real basis for a proportion of UFO reports, and that they relate to an actual phenomenon outside anything yet classified by science.\" alien and apparently non- human entities. 1 \" 6 ' 2. Fictional stories on the same lines, mostly dating from the pre- UFO period of the 1920s-1930s. 3. Myths, usually non-specific though occasionally including pur- ported names and locations, de- scribing events containing remark- ably similar features. 10 4. Accounts produced experi- mentally in which subjects with no particular UFO background describe supposed UFO abductions under the influence of drugs or hypnosis. 8 Study of the references indicated above reveals astonishing corre- spondences between these four kinds of report with such widely differing origins. For example: • European science fiction writers in the 1920s described imaginary situations which are so close to alleged abduction reports of the 1970s as to make coincidence well nigh unthinkable. Meheust's book 9 is devoted to these parallels; thus he cites a French SF yarn whose hero finds himself in a small room, lit by a green diffused light emanating from no discernible source but rather from the material of the vessel itself; there are seemingly no doors or windows, but these appear when required. Compare this with Higdon who found himself in a small room, brightly lit but with no obvious source of light, or with Diaz 9 who could see no light and felt that the walls were translucent; like the SF hero, he was in a small room without furniture of any kind, (to get the full impact of these parallels, of course, the accounts should be read at length.) • Vallee 12 has devoted a book to the parallels between UFO reports and myth. Whatever we think of his thesis, his basic point is well made: it is hard not to presume some com- mon source when Vallee bombards you with such parallels as this: Betty Hill 4 reported that during her exam- ination a long needle was inserted into her navel — The 15th century Calendrier des Bergers shows de- mons piercing their victims abdom- ens with long needles. One such parallel might be coincidence, but not this many.... • The encounters induced under hypnosis, experimentally, by Alvin Lawson and his team aston- ished the experimenters by their close similarity to allegedly factual accounts. This is the more remark- able since the subjects had first been screened to include only those with minimal ufological knowledge. (Clearly, as Hendry 6 has pointed out, nobody these days can be expected to be completely ignorant of UFO's!) The subjects described their imagi- nary experiences in terms which were virtually indistinguishable from those used by the people who claimed to have actually undergone the experiences: again you need to study the scripts at length to get the full force of the parallels, but here's a sample: A. They seem to have brought me to this.. .it almost seems like a tube. The ceiling is about 20 feet high. B. I can see the sky up there... it's like a long tube, jagged... C. It's sort of like a tube, like I sort of feel that I'm at the bottom of a irube looking up... In fact, A is an experimental hypnosis subject, B is a \"real\" ab- ductee, and C is a drug-induced- hallucination subject. In short, what we have is a sit- uation where four kinds of report, emanating from wholly different origins, produce correspondence of coincidence-defying similarity. This argues that they are either deriving from one another, or all deriving from some common substratum, some widely—if not universally— available image bank. It is hard to see how they could be deriving from or»e another. To 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(Archetype, Continued) suppose a linear or sequential devel- opment, myth to SF and SF to alleged fact, leads to absurdity: how could a Brazilian farmer have access to SF stories in French of half a century before—and even if it happened by a strange chance once, how could it keep on happening? The Significance of Myth The view of Paul Misraki, 10 sub- sequently elaborated and irres- ponsibly extended by Von Daniken and others, was that mythical ac- counts are similar to allegedly factual accounts for the simple reason that they are factual accounts, which have been blurred by time. However, while it may be the case that UFO abductions have been taking place throughout history, there is no good evidence to that effect, and to assume it would be highly question-begging. For one thing, the supporters of the theory need to show why we have reports from the distant past, and reports from our own day, but virtually nothing in between—why were there no abductions in the time of Shakespeare or Dr. Johnson or the Victorians, periods when, though the critical apparatus of our own day wasn't available, at least we could have expected a fair standard of reporting which would help us gauge the authenticity of the account? In the absence of any such continuing tradition, I surmise that . the mythical accounts are something quite different from the factual accounts of our own time. For our present purpose, the significance of the mythical accounts is that they were what people wanted to tell and hear. Far from being accounts of actual happenings, it is more probable that they describe precisely what does not happen in real life. Real life is untidy and unsatisfactory; things happen and nobody knows why, things start and don't finish, loose ends proliferate. To impose some pattern on reality is a basic human instinct, which is what keeps story-tellers and myth-makers in business. The relation of myth to reality is that myth represents the filling of gaps in reality. Fairies and angels, and their equivalents in later cultures, are \"needed\" to complete our world picture; they and encounters with them, are things which we feel, con- sciously or unconsciously, some or most or even all of us, that reality should somehow contain. If super- human entities don't exist, mankind must invent them. I think we must accept that there is a real basis for a proportion of UFO reports, and that they relate to an actual phenomenon outside any- thing yet classified by science. Even if we set aside all material or photo- graphic evidence, it remains the case that we have thousands of well- presented reports, by persons ap- parently of sound mind and in no unusual emotional state, describing physical objects rationally and lucidly, and frequently with multiple confirmation. To dismiss such evi- dence is quite simply perverse. \"...these percipients are clearly dredging up, from somewhere within themselves, aspects of what they expect or wish or fear to see....\" At the same time, I think, we must accept that whatever reality UFOs possess, it is different from any reality we know. Their ability to change shape, to respond to indivi- dual percipients, to be seen by some and not by others, taken along with so many other logic-defying features of their behavior and that of their occupants, means that we are up against something totally different from anything previously exper- ienced by mankind (with the signifi- cant exception of certain categories of psychical phenomena). If, however, we accept that the typical unexplained UFO report has some correspondence with reality, we really paint ourselves into a cor- ner as regards the abduction reports; for we must choose between saying, \"Ah, but they are exceptions\" with- out any good reason for so saying, or accepting that they, too, are based upon reality. Which means we have to explain how it comes about that real reports should correspond so closely with parallel accounts which we know to be total fabrications. We have already discounted the like- lihood that they derive from one another; but what is left? Paradox to the Rescue At this point we have to take into account another complication which at first sight seems to make matters even worse, if possible, though as we shall find, it actually gives us the vital clue we need, which shows how right Fort was to be so fond of paradoxes! The new horror we have to face is this: both Michel Monnerie 11 in France, and Allan Hendry 6 in the U.S. have established that many de- tailed sightings relate to IFOs, not UFOs. Percipients have described windows on the planet Venus and ascribed purposeful maneuvers to the moon! Monnerie suggests that what is happening in such cases is that the sight of something unplace- able induces in some people a \"waking dream\"—a state in which the subconscious overrides the con- scious. This may or may not be the case; what concerns us is the fact that these percipients are clearly dredging up, from somewhere within themselves, aspects of what they expect or wish or fear to see, and plastering them onto the innocent Moon or whatever. The thing seen plays no part in the process; the percipient does it all. Now you see why this apparent complication is so significant. For it shows, beyond question, that some people do possess inside themselves the do-it-yourself kit necessary for transforming reality into fantasy. And if IFO observers can do it, then so can UFO observers; so perhaps, can all of us! I suggest that we are justified in concluding that some, perhaps all, of us carry about, in our subconscious (Continued on next page) 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"UFO CRASH/RETRIEVALS: A CRITIQUE OF GREENWELL'S CRITIQUE By Virgil Staff Leonard Stringfield's use of the word \"syndrome\" provides J. Richard Greenwell with the opport- unity, in paragraphs one and eleven of his \"Critique\" (No.153, Novem- ber 1980) to guess that the syn- drome may be a \"clinical entity\" deriving from \"several kinds of socio-psychological phenomena, in- fluenced by media imagery, and facilitated by a receptive target in- dividual.\" It is the view of this writer that Greenwell provides no data to support this conclusion, and that the \"Critique\" should be considered as little more than a statement of his own views without benefit of stated support. Initially, Greenwell admits that he does not believe in the authen- ticity of such reports. In the second paragraph he tells us that he doubts the presence of any government interest in UFOs. Either Greenwell does not read the literature with care, or he interprets it differently from most Ufologists. We are told that \"recovery\" in- cidents would require hundreds of specialists all of whom would be unlikely to remain silent. This may well be, and Stringfield's informers may be an initial indication that Greenwell is correct. We are unin- formed concerning the size of the force that governmental agencies might have employed in studying the alleged crash/retrievals, but cer- tainly this force could have been smaller than Greenwell apparently believes should such agencies have concerned themselves with only limited aspects of what was believed might relate to national security. Greenwell asks if \"any of these specialists stepped forward to ident- ify themselves publicly?\" Does he really expect these individuals to jeopardize their positions and their futures? And does he believe, after retirement, that these same individ- uals would be likely to expose what some, may have concealed for 20 years or longer? Would the reader, in the same position, and consider- ing the possible penalities, make a public expose? It can be guessed that some might but that many would not. Greenwell then asks: \"None have had doubts about their secret involvement? Nobody has been tempted by the subsequent fame and fortune? The answer to these questions, regretably, is 'no'.\" How does Greenwell know the answers to these questions? How can he speak for others than himself? Did any of these specialists inform Greenwell of the extent to which they had possessed pangs of con- science over their activities? Does he expect these to publicly acknow- (Continued on next page) (Archetype, Continued) or wherever, all that is needed to fabricate an abduction report. What varies is the form and the circum- stances. From the distant past the material survives as myth, with fairies, angels or demons as the agents. SF writers regurgitate it in the form of adventure stories: in the 1920s they tended to attribute responsibility to Mad Scientists seeking to dominate the world. We, if we are subjected to hypnosis or drugs in a lab, will regurgitate the material in the form of an imaginary encounter, now with extraterrestrial humanoids playing the leading parts. If we experience a real-life trigger situation, whether IFO or UFO doesn't greatly matter, some of us— whether we do or don't presumably 10 depends on our psychological make- up—may regurgitate the material in the form of an encounter decked out in the cultural clothing of the day. In Bernadette Soubirous' day it was the Virgin Mary, as was appropriate to a pious teenage girl in a Catholic cul- ture; earlier it would have been religious-type flaming crosses in the sky; in our own day it is extrater- restrial humanoids. Onto the public skeleton we drape our private pre- occupations: Betty Andreasson 3 un- dergoes mystical experiences per- sonal to her personal situation, while Sandy Larson and Judy Kendall 8 suffer types of medical operations repeating real-life episodes. I still don't know why the ab- ductees are so preoccupied with the lights and doors. But I think we can guess that if we want to know, we are more likely to learn from the psycho- analyst than anyone else. For whether or not there is any reality underlying the abductee's stories, their characteristic features derive from some widely if not universally diffused scenario, which in its turn is made up of elements deeply em- bedded in all our subconsciouses.

And what would be the likely \"subsequent fame and fortune\" for one who tried to expose various activities of certain governmental agencies. Greenwell ' presumes that \"family and close friends\" might become knowledgeable and that the secret would have become wide- spread knowledge. But how does he know this would be the case? In fact, some of Stringfield's materials derive from secondary sources. In some cases, this may well have been the manner in which certain inform- ation has come to our attention. The Manhattan Project is noted as an example where secrecy was somewhat compromised. But is it believed that knowledge of the pro- ject was widespread? Did such knowledge become generally public? If scientists, who knew any- thing of the project, had been asked by the reader to provide additional information, would these have been likely to have done so? Would they have admitted to it or would they have denied knowledge? Further- more, what transpired concerning the Manhattan Project is not necessarily of significance. Analogies are dangerous, and more often than not they are false. Certainly a considerable number of scientists may have first-hand know- ledge of the crash/retrieval syndrome. In fact, these could be among the biggest public \"skeptics.\" Knowing the government position, what other position could they take? Greenwell airs the Harold Brown announcement of August 22, 1980 as an example of governmental inability to retain secrets. Does such a statement, relative to fear of ex- posure of Project Stealth, indicate that no secrets can be kept? Does it mean that the system of Confi- dential— Secret —Top Secret— Cryptographic is a farce? Can it be shown that governmental authorit- ies believe Project Stealth to be as significant as the presence of un- identified phenomena in our skies? Perhaps the dissemination of in- formation on the former was too widespread? Perhaps it was pre- sumed that the Russians already knew. Perhaps the project was aired for political reasons. Perhaps the military no longer cared. After all, the government, for its own reasons, and in one form or another, classifies almost everything. We do not know for certain why Project Stealth was publicized. Apparently we only have Harold Brown's word. So that again, Greenwell has at- tempted to build an analogy. But Project Stealth and the subject of the crash/retrievals are unrelated. Per- haps those ordinarily involved with the latter make up small, relatively tightly organized teams. Since knowledge of the subject would be on a \"need-to-know\" basis, and since specialists could be assigned to projects without these having the faintest knowledge of the total pur- pose, it might well be possible to conceal from all, except a few, the ultimate purpose of the efforts. Greenwell essentially tells us that since the powers were unable to conceal knowledge of Project Stealth, they would also be unable to conceal a secret UFO project. But how does he know this? He states his concern with a number of junior military personnel who allegedly have knowledge of the crash/ retrievals. But does he not know that there is an insufficient num- ber of generals to be at hand for every possible retrieval? Does he want the generals to play guard? Does he want them to catalog the effects? Does he want them to drive trucks? Greenwell does not believe that his list of junior military per- sonnel is the one he would pick to maintain military secrets. But in real- ity, these are a significant part of the force charged with maintaining the system of classified knowledge. All receive information on a'\"need-to- know\" basis and most have NAC clearances or more. In general, these keep a very tight lip. Greenwell lists seven books published in the 1970's with Stringfield's being the last of the seven on the list. He wants to know why all the people reported to Stringfield instead of to any of the other authors. Perhaps it was Stringfield's approach. Perhaps he asked the right questions, or per- haps he employed his extra time attempting to ferret out witnesses. Certainly there have been such reports since the early 1950's. But we know that most were not be- lieved. It is this writer's under- standing that Keyhoe, like Ruppelt, for many years looked askance at any alleged phenomena that smack- ed of a close encounter. Would there have been sufficient trust to have reported a crash/retrieval? Appar- ently there have been reports to William Moore and Stan Friedman. It seems doubtful that anyone would have approached Vallee, and we can forget the government apologist Phil Klass. Certainly it is doubtful that this arch debunker '\"would probably give his eye teeth to get information on UFO hardware for his magazine...\" Klass and his arm- chair identifications of Venus and plasmas, would be indelibly proven wrong and no one would hear of this gentleman again. Moreover, he might lose $10,000. Finally, there seems to be no obvious evidence that the Close Encounters film has markedly in- creased the number of reportable events. Greenwell, by his own ad- mission, recognizes that Stringfield's Case A-l of September, 1977 was given to Stringfield prior to the re- lease of the film, and he tries to protect his argument by stating that the publicity was out. This is a noto- riously weak excuse and we can presume that Greenwell would have shown relationship had he been able to provide'such. This writer must conclude that should Greenwell continue to be- lieve in the aburdity of crash/ retrievals as actual events, he will hopefully reconsider the subject and produce a more viable critique at some future time.

To investigate this question, a survey was made of all close en- counter \"unknowns\" in the files of UFO research (NSW). 56 cases (list- ed in the Appendix) were judged to have been sufficiently well-investi- gated to be included in this study. Many of the cases featured common psychological reactions and these are summarized in Table 1. (The table, in summary, indicates that reactions were specified in 46 cases—sometimes more than one reaction. Fear was expressed in 32 cases (69.6%); curiosity in 7 cases (15.2%); amazement and amnesia each were reported in 4 cases (8.7% each); puzzlement and follow-on dreams or nightmares in 3 cases each (6.5% each). The remainder of reported reactions were cited in only one or two cases each, including disbelief, excitement, calmness, mesmerization, lack of control (including feelings of being \"possessed\" or \"compelled\"), torment, disorientation, depression, annoyance, guilt, and impending doom.) As shown by this sample of cases, \"fear\" is the most common reaction to a close encounter UFO experience. \"Curiosity\" is the next (Critique, Continued) received a fair number of \"crashed saucer\" stories or leads, perhaps 10-25. Almost all were second- or third-hand, and efforts to reach first-hand witnesses were un- successful. Since then, some of these stories have been traced to the source. The stories, therefore, cannot be attributed to news media publicity or a single \"target individual.\" Nor did the stories come in all at once. Many years later I met one of the claimants face to face — a military officer and educator. He was very un- likely to be a hoaxter.) 12 most common reaction. In a number of cases, both fear and curiosity were experienced simultaneously—in- dicating an approach-avoidance con- flict where the witness wants to find out more about what he is observing but is afraid of the possible consequences. An interesting and potentially serious reaction is one of \"losing control.\" Vallee (1976), in looking at the social impact' of UFO phen- omena, has suggested that the lack of serious attention paid to UFOs by the scientific and governmental estab- lishments has resulted in a loss of faith by the general public in a scientific/rational interpretation of UFOs. Furthermore, since scientists and governments have failed to come to grips with the UFO problem, the general population is open to a feeling of powerlessness in relation to UFOs. Vallee gloomily predicts a forthcoming \"age of irrationality.\" What happens when we look at the pychological reaction in terms of \"positive\" (i.e. pleasant) versus \"negative\" (unpleasant) feelings? Curiosity, amazement, excitement and calmness were classified as \"pos- itive\" feelings; the remainder as \"negative\" feelings. We find that \"negative\" feelings predominate. However, this result is mainly deter- mined by the very large proportion of cases where \"fear\" is experienced. (Note that this simple classification of \"positive\" and \"negative\" feelings is not absolute. How a feeling is interpreted may depend very much on both the individual and the situation.) So far we have dealt with psycho- logical reactions during a UFO sighting. What about reactions subsequent to a sighting? On the whole, any reactions subsequent to the sighting were mainly a continu- ation of reactions during the sighting. One exception is that in three cases the witnesses subsequently exper- ienced dreams or nightmares about their sightings. However, this could well be a continuation of the initial fear reaction. In summary, fear and curiosity are common psychological reactions to UFO events, whereas the re- maining range of reactions could reflect individual differences. In a number of cases, . physiological reactions also accompanied or follow- ed the UFO experience, (see Table 2). Could these physiological re- actions be psychologically induced? For example, hair \"standing on end\" is a classic example of a physiological accompaniment to a feeling of fear. It is quite possible that many of the physiological effects described in the UFO literature are psychosomatic in origin, rather than a direct physical effect by the UFO. Is someone who reacts with fear (or other dramatic reaction) during a sighting more likely to have seen an \"authentic\" UFO? In other words, are psychological reactions to un- identified flying objects different from psychological reactions to identified flying objects? According to Hendry (1979, p.104), there are similar psychological reactions to UFOs and IFOs. After a study of over 1,000 cases, he concluded that: \"The fear elicited by the UFO and IFO sightings is not in direct response to what is being experienced, but rather to what is being anticipated in advance.\" People have been socially conditioned to believe in, and fear, \"extraterrestrial spaceships\". An examination of \"identified\" reports in NSW supports the view that people can react similarly to UFOs and IFOs. One dramatic ex- ample of a witness reaction to an apparent IFO is case NA78-064. A school teacher was driving home"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"(Reactions, Continued) when he saw a very bright silver- white, cigar-shaped object station- ary in the sky. It was seen for about 30 seconds and no sound was de- tected. The sighting stimulus was probably a distant balloon or air- craft. Yet the witness stated that he experienced definite \"feelings\" had been \"transmitted\" from the object: \"It wasn't aggressive, and it wasn't afraid—it was just sitting there as if it were a part of the sky, a part of the scheme of things,a part of nature... It seemed to know how to be a part of the Universe, and wasn't concerned what we think of it. It was...seem- ingly only a very short incident, but has had a fairly great impact on my understanding of man's existence on earth and his relationship with God.\" To this man, the alleged \"UFO\" experience was a religious experience. In other cases, people have become quite alarmed and up- set while watching the apparent motions of the Planet Venus dis- torted by the atmosphere. All of this indicates that we should be cautious in accepting a witness's dramatic emotional re- action as an indicator of a \"genuine\" UFO event. The same reaction may occur in an IFO sighting. In the case of psychological reactions, the way the individual perceives an event may be more important than the actual physical event. On the other hand, Hynek (1974) has drawn a relationship between a psychological reaction to a UFO sighting and the sighting reliability. He refers to the commonr ly occurring \"escalation of hypoth- eses\" where the UFO witness at- tempts to explain the phenomenon he is observing by a series of increas- ingly more complex and exotic ex- planations. Thus the witness may see a light in the sky and interpret it firstly as a star, then an aircraft and finally a UFO. : In Hynek's view, this reaction adds credibility to the per- son reporting the UFO and shows that he is not automatically jumping to exotic interpretations until he is forced to by the strangeness of his UFO experience.

For example, in case NA78-072, two people observed a bright, white light approach them from over a hill opposite them. The reporting wit- ness stated: \"It appeared to be the headlight of an aircraft but it was moving very, very slowly towards us. I didn't take any notice of it thinking it was an aircraft.\" The light descended in front of the hill, illum- inating the treetops below it. \"At this stage we thought it might have been a helicopter but there was absolute silence.\" Finally the light stopped level with the witnesses and at a distance 150-200 yards away. One of the observers picked up a rifle and fired at the light which promptly went out. \"We discussed the event that night and couldn't sleep well for we had no idea what it could have been and were afraid it might have been a fellow with a torch.\" The witnesses returned to the location the next morning to search for vehicle tracks or footprints, but found nothing. \"To this day I have no idea what it could have been.\" Thus in this case, there was an esca- lation of hypotheses from aircraft to helicopter to man with torch to UFO. Westrum (1979, p. 94) has point- ed out that \"the mere existence of such an escalation does not prove that an anomaly is involved. In the first place, anomaly accounts are frequent enough so that this pattern is well known to many people in society who would wish to fake anomaly encounters.\" However, \"one may well question the motives of a person involved in an alleged anomaly encounter where no esca- lation of hypotheses has taken place. The value of such a sighting is also questionable in terms of details the witness alleges to have observed.\" If the witness requires only a few cues to conclude that he is observing a UFO, this may mean that he will not critically scrutinize the object he is observing and that he will report details conforming to his own stere- otype of what a UFO should look like. While the \"escalation of hypo- theses\" mechanism may add to the credibility of a UFO report, it should once again be noted that belief may be more important than the actual physical stimulus. Thus there may be an escalation of hypotheses oc- curing with IFO observers, starting with a mundane interpretation and escalating to the erroneous con- clusion of \"UFO.\" There may well be other psycho- logical reactions to UFO events which have not been covered by the sample of cases in this study. For instance, I eliminated two cases which appear to be explicable as due to psychological disturbance. How- ever, a \"psychotic reaction,\" in pre- disposed individuals, could be a valid psychological reaction to a UFO event. The critical issue here is whether the psychological disturb- ance initiated a spurious UFO sight- ing report, or whether an authentic, though traumatic, UFO experience triggered a psychotic reaction. (See Moravec, 1980, for a further dis- cussion on this point.) As another example, alleged \"abduction\" cases could be interpreted as involving a psychological reaction in the form of a hallucinatory experience;' such a (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Reactions, Continued) reaction occurring under certain, yet- to-be specified conditions. An additional finding of this study is that it is not easy to study psychological reactions to UFO events. The factors listed below may all act as sources of bias: • A proportion of missing or unin- vestigated cases where psycho- logical reactions are unknown. • Insufficiently investigated cases where no psychological reactions are specified. • The sometimes dubious evalua- tion of cases as \"unknown\" versus \"identified.\" In this study, I evaluated all cases in the files and omitted a substanial number of identified reports originally classified as \"unknowns.\" • The sometimes sloppy labelling of a UFO report as a \"close en- counter,\" being more a reflection of the wishes of the witness and investigator than a precise mea- sure of distance. In this study I omitted those \"close encount- ers\" which appeared to be nothing more than distant lights or objects. • In some case writeups, it is unclear whether the recorded \"psychological\" reaction is in the witness's own words or is merely an investigator's possibly erron- eous or exaggerated inter- pretation. • It is often unclear as to whether or not physiological reactions have been psychologically in- duced (by fear or anxiety). • Report form questions asking about \"psychological effects\" tend to be always answered, but with- out speccfying how important the psychological reaction was in that particular case. • The most dramatic psy- chological reaction (such as fear) may be more likely to be reported than more subtle reactions. . • Since the study was restricted to \"close encounters,\" certain kinds of psychological reactions (such as fear) may be more predom- inant than would be shown in a 14 study of all types of UFO cases. In conclusion, this study shows that: (1) The most common psychological reaction to close encounter UFO events is fear. The next most common reaction is curiosity. (2) As well as these common re- actions, there is a wide range of other reactions, possibly dependent on each individual's personality or situation. (3) The most common physiological reactions are trouble sleeping and sensitive or sore eyes. Some or all of these physiological reactions may be psychosomatic, i.e., psychologically induced. (4) Witnesses may react similarly to both UFOs and IFOs. This implies the caution that not too much weight is placed on the witness's emotional reaction to his sighting as a measure of his credibility. (5) There are difficulties in attempt- ing to study psychological reactions to UFO events, particularly the problems of insufficient investiga- tion and evaluation of past cases. Finally, the fact that many people fear something which offic- ially doesn't exist, makes a powerful reason for the urgent and serious study of UFO phenomena. REFERENCES Hendry, A.

By John DeHerrera Fantastic is one way of describing the weekly science series entitled \"Cosmos.\" Educational and enter- taining would be more descriptive though. This television series is the brainchild of Carl Sagan, professor of astronomy at Cornell University, author, astrophysicist, exobiologist, and promoter of science. Sagan has even become a celebrity, appearing on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. He has attracted many admirers who look to him for leadership and inspiration. Each week viewers are treated to a spectacular visual presentation of the stars, planets, and other heavenly wonders. And there are the stories of some famous pioneers of science, enacted to show how really clever they were. A journey through a giant model of the human brain explains the functions of the neurons and compares the brain to our modern computers. Most astonishing was The Search for Intelligent Extraterrestrial life program on Cosmos. Carl Sagan calculates how many worlds in our galaxy may be inhabited — and with a radio telescope tunes in on a distant star. \"What might these broadcasts from space teach us,\" he asks. Sagan is involved with NASA's Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project. Convinced that there is other intelligent life in outer space, they would like billions of dollars in public funding to carry out this search. Included in the search for extra- terrestrial intelligence program was a discussion of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). This discussion was undoubtly a low point in the Cosmos series. It was very brief and con- cerned only the report from a New Hampshire couple in 1961. They had seen a flying saucer (what appears to be a spaceship or aircraft) and had been badly shaken by this close sighting. Eventually they went to see a psychiatrist and his use of hypnosis brought out the story that the couple had been captured and taken aboard the flying saucer. Research done by my colleagues and I show that a person under hypnosis can be very creative. ' Very likely the original UFO sighting was correctly reported though. There have been thousands of these reports. Some are close and involve multiple witnesses. Sagan's coverage of the New Hampshire case was not only very brief, but inaccurate as well. He is known to have a strong dislike of this subject and his coverage demonstrated this. He compares the fuss about UFOs with religious beliefs, superstitious beliefs, and the belief in Santa Claus. After the UFO discussion, Sagan covered — in great detail and in glowing terms — the deciphering of Egyptian hiero- glyphics. Cosmic Search is a magazine pub- lished by a private organization dedicated to the promotion and support of SETI endeavors. Their first volume in January, 1979, had the following to say about UFOs and other \"pseudo-scientific\" interest: \"Why this public fascination with the exotic and the pseudo-scientific, especially when the world of circum- stance is infinitely more subtile and surprising? Our students need to experience Close Encounters of at least three kinds — with logic, with math, and with science.\" In 1976, the American Humanist Association created the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). This committee is supposedly dedicated to combating the rise in pseudo- science. The stated objective is \"not to reject on a priori grounds, ante- cedent to inquiry, any or all (para- normal) claims, but rather to examine them openly, completely, objectively and carefully.\" Carl Sagan and other scientists have been enlisted by CSICOP as have some science fiction writers, science writers, a magician, and others. Utilizing the talents of their fellow writers, the committee has published many articles in their efforts to combat pseudo-science. The CSICOP editor published an article in Smithsonian magazine and later in Readers Digest entitled \"UFOs, Horoscopes, Bigfoot, Psychics, and Other Nonsense.\" Other published statements by CSICOP members expound the same nonsense theme: \"We feel that it is the duty of the scientific community to show that these beliefs (UFOs, bio- rhythms, astrology, etc.) are utterly screwball.\" \"I predict that the 1980s will see us relieved of the burdens of astrology, flying saucers, Jeane Dixon, the Bermuda Triangle and other idiocies.\" (Continued on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(Calif. Report, Continued) There have been other publica- tions — all negative in their treat- ment of unusual phenomena. They make it very clear to everyone that there is no reason to be concerned with these phenomena. It is all pseudo-scientific nonsense and not worthy of any scientific attention. Close examination of Carl Sagan's published statements and those of the other committee members reveals that they repeatedly fail to deal with facts or specific reports. Rather, they prefer to employ propaganda tactics to win their arguments. Propaganda is an expression of opinion in a way designed to influence other groups or individuals. The tactics are shrewd but effective. Hoping to capitalize on sympathy or a lack of information, the propagandist utilizes psychological and emotional appeal. In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Mark Antony sways the unsophisticated crowd by repeating the word honorable and honorable men. He does not prove that Brutus was dishonorable, in fact Brutus had earlier proven otherwise. Soon the mob is emotionally charged, ready to bum and slay in their indignation. Wouldn't it be much better to deal in facts rather than use propaganda tactics? Dr. Hynek, who is a friend of Carl Sagan, has expressed concern that he does not take the time to examine at least some of the better UFO reports. How then is Sagan qualified to speak knowledgably on the subject of unidentified flying objects? There are several techniques of illogical persuasion (fallacies) utilized by CSICOP members. Arousing the passions of people by repeating the words \"pseudo-scientific\" and \"non- sense\" is called argumentum adpopulum. An appeal to authority such as the \"scientists\" or \"authorities\" is called argumentum ad verecundiam. Attacking the truth of another's statements by calling him a \"kook\" or \"hoaxter\" is called argumentum ad hominem. Name calling is a device to make us form a judgment without examining the evidence. Mixing UFO reports with astrology and Jeane Dixon then dismissing everything listed as nonsense is \"guilt by association.\" Each subject should be judged on it's own merits. If one is nonsense this has no bearing on the other. In logic, two circles within a circle represent two related items. But apples are always apples and oranges are always oranges even if they are both fruit. The UFO pheno- menon is related to other phenomena in that they are all unexplained. But while gravity and other forces are unexplained also, this does not make them nonsense. On the matter of UFOs, a steady stream of reports, sometimes by police or military and civilian pilots, continue. In spite of the \"official\" Air Force debunking (this debunking was a CIA idea) 4 the Project Blue Book investigators, Captain Ruppelt, Dr. Hynek, and others found many reports very real and convincing. Obviously many people are growing tired of the sensational tabloid articles and television documentaries on paranormal phenomena. Any writer or producer with funding can gather the most incredible stories and present this as factual information. This irresponsible coverage has done a great deal to tarnish the subject of UFOs. Finally, we must say that Sagan's discussion of UFOs was snobbish and insulting to researchers and wit- nesses alike. If he and his SETI colleagues and all their funding stopped, their progress would also halt. Maybe this is what should be done: Take some of NASA's funding and use it for UFO research. It's high time we solve — once and for all — what the nature of UFOs really is. REFERENCES 1. Fuller, John G., The Interrupted Journey, Dial Press, New York, 1965. 2.

Letters Bailey Case Editor, Richard Hall's commentary on the Rev. Bailey article (No. 155, Jan- uary 1981) is a welcome editorial practice, for such critiques should accompany case investigation reports whenever possible. However, as persons who were involved in varying degrees in Bailey's hypnotic regres- sion, it would have been more fair had we been allowed to critique the commentary. Hall's discussion mis- leadingly implies that hypnotist Dr. W.C. McCall's methodology was biased, either from incompetence or by design. The record should be set straight. Hall writes,\"... the techniques of hypnotic regression used do not in- spire confidence that an objectively real experience is being described. At the precise point where Bailey, under hypnosis, is not recalling an abduction, the hypnotist — up to abduction, the hypnotist—up to then asking neutral questions—abruptly suggests to the witness that he de- scribe an imaginary abduction....\" This passage is followed by a discus- sion of inconsistencies in Bailey's narrative and quotes McCall asking Bailey to \"imagine that you were taken aboard.\" All of the above implies that in Bailey's case the imaginary protocol was instituted capriciously or—worse—in an attempt to lead the witness into describing a non-existent abduction which the investigators wished to present as real. This impli- cation is simply not true. In the use of hypnosis in medicine, an accepted technique of getting an individual to uncover repressed or hidden experiences is to have him imagine he is seeing a movie, a television show, a stage play, etc. Thus the scenario is set with what facts are known to the hypnotist and then the patient is encouraged to amplify and describe the so-called \"action on the stage.\" In Rev. Bailey's case a great deal (Continued on next page) 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ZETETIC SCHOLAR: A REVIEW Serious ufologists often bemoan the lack of true skeptics whose con- structive criticisms would be benefi- cial to all seekers of truth about UFOs. Instead, we have a surplus of debunkers whose arguments tend to be just as slanted and emotionally loaded as the most zealous of UFO promoters. Although no individual presently stands out as a scientific skeptic, a very worthwhile publica- tion partly fills that need though its subject matter includes all \"claims of anomalies and the paranormal.\" That publication is the Zetetic Scholar. ZS, in addition to feature articles and reviews, has on-going dialogues on controversial topics such as UFOs, ESP, Bigfoot, and the occult. Editor Marcello Truzzi is determined that ZS will maintain an \"agnostic\" — as opposed to a debunking — tone. Believers, debunkers, and those in between all have their say in \"the spirit of responsible dialogue be- tween proponents and critics.\" Among the frequent contributors are many well-known proponents and critics of UFOs. Issue No. 7, December 1980, fea- tures almost 50 pages of dialogue on UFOs. Truzzi's editorial in that issue says, \"The object of science is to expand our knowledge and not merely to use our existing know- ledge to discredit or 'explain away' new claims.\" We, of course, need to discredit such claims if they don't stand up under investigation, but on the other hand simplistic \"answers\" often succeed only in raising many more questions. \"Valid anomalies are forces for growth and progress; we should welcome, not fear them,\" Truzzi concludes. ZS is expensive ($12 U.S. and $18 foreign for one year) and in- frequent (biannual, approx. in July and December), but it is also sub- stantial and lengthy (No. 7, 166 pages; No. 6, 186 pages).

Then, because of sug- gestions that a post-hynotic \"block\" could have been applied to him as a UFO \"abductee,\" a technique to cir- cumvent this supposed block was attempted, even though we have never observed a true block in any of the alleged CE-III witnesses we have regressed. As Mrs. Druffel conceded at the time, Bailey was instructed to use his imagination in an effort to get a flow of information from him. But neither Hall nor Druffel indicate that at the end of the session Mrs. Druffel was told that McCall did-iL^ believe Rev. Bailey \"Had had any Vf these experiences, and that the inform- ation we obtained from him was deemed unreliable. The mistaken conclusions about our methodology and/or compe- tency in hypnotic regression may have been encouraged by some neg- ative comments about us which were appended to Druffel's original type- script of the Bailey session, which Hall quotes from. If so, we would re- mind him that attitudes about \"ab- ductees\" and the reliabilty of hypno- tic recall data are not always deter- mined rationally. We have had a good deal of irrational response from ufologists because of our imaginary abduction experiments (MUFON Journal, Nov., Dec., 1977)—ranging from feigned indifference to distor- tion and outrage. The \"will to believe\" dies hard; believers are unlikely to be ^persuaded by arg&rient or scientific demonstration, and their rhetorical death-throes are seldom models of objectivity. We agree with much of Hall's skeptical assessment of the Bailey case, but he would have been both wiser and more fair had he conferred with the others present during Bailey's regression. Hall states that ufologists continue to underestimate the role of human psychology. We concur, but it is important to con- sider the psychology of the pro- ponent-investigator as well as that of the \"abductee.\" W.C. McCall, M.D. ALvin H. Lawson, PhD Garden Grove, Cali£ (Editor's Reply: No implication was in- tended that the investigators tried to lead the witness into an imaginary abduction which they wished to present as real.

In my Director's Message for the March edition of the Journal, I is- sued a public invitation to the Board of Directors of APRO to seriously re- consider their isolationist attitude and establish a cooperative rapport with MUFON and CUFOS. An APRO general membership meet- ing scheduled for April 4, 1981, could be a step in the right direction, since the Board of Directors must be legally expanded, which will bring aboard new faces and talent. Speaking of cooperation in the field of UFOlogy, I am pleased to announce that Robert J. Gribble, Director of Phenomena Research, P.O. Box 1807, Seattle, WA 98111, has accepted MUFON's invitation to utilize our vast field investigators network to investi- gate UFO sighting reports re- ceived on their national UFO reporting center telephone \"hot- line.\" The Betty Cash/Vicky Landrum medical case that occurred on December 29,1980, near Dayton, Texas is the first case referred to MUFON and is presently under thorough investigation by John F. 1 Schuessler, MUFON Deputy Director, and his colleagues in VISIT. The serious medical implica- tions make this a very significant case in current UFO history. Preliminary investigation reports were submitted to Bob Gribble and shared with APRO. Only the best reports received by Phenomena Research will be referred to MUFON for investigation, thus eliminating the typical \"lights in the sky.\" MUFON has also been working with R. Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D., in the development of a list of investi- gators who either utilize time re- gression procedures or work with practioners of hypnosis, in order to assist UFO witnesses to recall more about the UFO encounters. By having a team of members geo- graphically located from coast to coast in the United States, it will simplify and expedite prompt inter- views with the minimum amount of travel and expense. Currently this list is composed of 29 people, many of them MUFON members. Hyp- notic regression is another tool at the UFO investigators disposal to disclose information which has been obliterated from the witness' con- cious mind.
