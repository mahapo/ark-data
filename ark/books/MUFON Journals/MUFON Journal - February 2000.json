The sightings occurred in three major areas along the highway: Fox Lake, The Village of Carmacks, and The Village of Pelly Cross- ing, each having 6, 9 and 7 witnesses respectively (see Figure 1). This total of 22 people is a minimum number, and only includes those identi- fied to the investigator by name. There were other wit- nesses (or vehicles) reported on scene. All but one of the witnesses wish to remain anonymous. Between the time period of February 1999 and September 1999, 19 out of the 22 witnesses have been inter- viewed (only 2 of these were second hand accounts). This report documents the witnesses' descriptions resulting from these interviews. Fourteen of the wit- nesses have supplied drawings of the UFO. Comparing the size of the UFO observed to that of a football stadium is not due to exaggeration on the witnesses' part. On the contrary, this comparison is conservative, as it will be shown in this report that the UFO was likely much larger. A reasonably accurate estimate of the size of the UFO (or UFOs) was accomplished through a method based on geometry called \"triangulation.\" (See \"Cal- culation of UFO size\" at end of this article.) This method was employed 6 times to obtain 6 estimates for the size of the UFO. All revealed staggering re- sults: the UFO ranged anywhere from 0.88 km (0.55 miles) to 1.8 km (1.1 miles) in length! For compari- son, the Toronto Skydome stadium is 0.21 km (0.13 miles) at it's widest point. In order to keep witness identities anonymous, \"Code Names\" were developed consisting of the fol- lowing format. For those witnesses who observed the UFO near Fox Lake the witness code names given were FOX1, FOX2, FOX3..., for those near Braebum Lodge 34 Km (21 Mi) from Foi lake Figure 1.

Carmacks, CRM1, CRM2, CRM3..., and for those near Pelly Crossing, PEL1, PEL2, PEL3...etc. The Narrative Witnesses FOX2 and FOX3 were driving together from Whitehorse to Carmacks in two separate vehicles. As they were travelling northbound on the Klondike Highway adjacent to Fox Lake, they spotted a huge UFO out over the frozen lake. Fox Lake is on the west side of the highway. Both of them slammed on the brakes, stop- ping about 570 metres (1870 ft) apart from each other (refer to map shown in Figure 2). FOX2 got out of his vehicle for a better observation. The UFO proceeded to slowly drift towards FOX2 and after a few minutes he found himself almost directly underneath the object! FOX3 continued to observe his cousin FOX2; both men were in complete awe! (See drawings by FOX3, Figures 3 and 4, and simulated graphic on cover). The UFO continued to move slowly across the high- way and out over the hill to the east and eventually dis- appeared behind it. Also, see drawing by FOX2 (Figure 5). Immediately after the sighting, FOX3 noted that the time was 8:30 p.m. Both FOX2 and FOX3 could dis- cern that the lights were attached to a smooth and solid object."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 February 2000 MUFON UFO Journal At the very same time that FOX2 and FOX3 were observing the UFO move across the lake, FOX4 and FOX5 were approaching the southern tip of Fox Lake also heading northbound (see map, Figure 2). What they observed was a huge row, or rows, of lights slowly moving across the lake. There were other lights on and around the UFO as well. See drawings by FOX4 and FOX5 (Figures 6 and 7) and Fox4's esti- mated size compared to known landmarks (Figure 15). Their first thought was that it was a large truck in the distance, but it couldn't be, since it was out over the lake. Their next thought was that a Boeing 747 was crash landing. But that couldn't be either, since it was moving much too slowly to be an aircraft. It took them about 2 seconds to process these thoughts when they realized that it must be a UFO! They be- came very concerned. They had a two-year-old son in the back seat and they were travelling towards this thing! After some debate they decided to continue their journey. After all, they could no longer see the UFO as they approached a hill that obscured their view, plus there was some traffic ahead of them. FOX5 looked at the car clock, it was 8:23 pm. None of the witnesses heard any sound coming from the object. A few minutes later, when FOX4 and FOX5 were passing the Fox Lake campground, they passed by two vehicles that were pulled over with two men out- side looking up at the sky. They turned around and pulled over to talk to them. It was FOX2 and FOX3 carrying on a lively discussion, \"What the 'heck' was that?\" After a few minutes FOX4 and FOX5 left and eventually stopped at Braeburn Lodge about 34 km (21 miles) further up the highway. FOX4 walked into the lodge and said to Steve Watson, the lodge owner, \"Steve, I really need a coffee!\" Steve replied \"Oh, you must have seen what [FOX 1 ] saw?\" In fact FOX4 recalled seeing FOX1 leaving Braeburn Lodge just as they got there. About half an hour before the sighting described above (about 8 p.m.) FOX1 was driving along Fox Lake and had noticed a light in the distance which should not have been there. He did not think too much of it, but as he got closer to the light, he could tell that it was illuminating a long smooth curved sur- face. He then passed some traffic and after his eyes readjusted to the darkness, the curved surface and the light were gone. However, his eye caught a group of rectangular lights moving over and behind a hill to the east. At this point he got an \"exhilarating feeling\" and sped up in order to reach a less obscured location in the valley so that he would have a chance to see the UFO again. He pulled over and got out of his vehicle but pg round Scale (km) indicates witness locations Figure 2. Fox Lake area and witness locations. didn't see anything more unusual. He continued his jour- ney and pulled into Braeburn Lodge where he gave Steve a description of what he saw, and also made drawings for him. FOX2 and FOX3 eventually pulled into Braeburn Lodge and gave their description to Steve as well. There was also a 6th witness to the Fox Lake sight- ing, but it is unclear what time she had driven through the area. FOX6 was driving in the vicinity of Fox Lake when she noticed a glow on her dashboard that could not be accounted for by the interior illumination of her vehicle. She leaned forward to look up through her wind- shield and observed a large arrangement of multi col- ored lights. The interior lights in her car started to go dim and the music from her tape deck slowed down. Between 8:30 and 9 p.m., the Village of Pelly Cross- ing (about a 2-hour drive to the north of Fox Lake) was experiencing its own truly incredible UFO sighting. PEL1 was tending his trapline northeast of Pelly when he observed in the distance to the southwest a long row of lights slowly moving over the hills. At first he thought"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 2000 PageS : /\"\"•ves^^i^^jsj'^iaMi*-'\" - S't Figure 3: Drawing by Fox3 of overview of UFO.

But it was moving much too slowly. \"It's a UFO!\" As he was walking, his flashlight happened to point in the direction of the UFO. As if reacting to his flashlight, the UFO started speeding rapidly toward him. He instinctively cupped the end of his flashlight. As soon as he completed this gesture, the UFO stopped in its track. In a matter of less than a second, it was hovering an estimated 300 yards (275 metres) in front of him! PEL 1 had to turn his head from one side to the other to take it all in. (See graphic Figure 8, based on witness' drawings, and the investigators interpretation Figure 9). Again there was no sound at all coming from the object. A beam of light emanating from the bottom of the UFO swept the ground once directly underneath the object. Was it a search beam looking for him? The UFO then drifted slowly to the right. There were other beams emanating from the craft as well; a greenish phosphorescent color beam shone horizontally out the front (right); two beams at the back (left) rotated slowly to a horizontal position. All the beams could be seen clearly as there were ice crystals in the air. PEL1 turned away from the UFO momentarily and ran across a small clearing. When he turned back to look at it, it was gone. Figure 10 shows the location of the witness and his estimated trajectory of the UFO. At about the same time, PEL2 and PEL3 were trav- elling northbound just south of Pelly Crossing, to the north when they spotted a huge row of lights slowly moving from left to right. They pulled over at a gravel pit just south of the Village to get a better look and got out of their vehicle. PEL2 noticed that the Big Dipper was just above the row of lights and compared the length of the lights to the width of the Big Dipper. They were about the same length! This observation was very Beam Scanning towards and away Figure 7: Drawing by Fox5. important, since it established a well-referenced angu- lar size of the UFO from PEL2 and PELS's perspec- tive, important for a more accurate triangulation and calculation of UFO size. The map shown in Figure 10 shows the location of witnesses PEL2 and PEL3 and their estimate of the UFO trajectory. The accounts of witnesses PEL! through 3 were enough to complete a calculation of UFO size. The observations of witnesses PEL4, 5, 6 and 7 about the same time provided a second triangulation. Their lo- cation is also indicated on the map in Figure 10. The four women were taking an evening course at a small community college in Pelly Grossing (a satellite school of Yukon College). They were out on a break on the front deck of the one-story building looking towards the west when they too observed the row of lights. The row of lights was travelling slowly almost towards them and slightly towards the north. They recall the object being huge as well; there was no sound at all. It moved slowly over the hill to the north and disappeared be- hind it. Then there was the UFO sighting near the Village of Carmacks by 9 witnesses. The UFO was observed by two groups of people. CRM1, 2, 3 and 4 were on the highway northbound in a pick-up truck just south of Carmacks; CRM5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 consisted of a hus- band, wife and their 3 children. They were watching television when they spotted the row of lights out of their window. The locations of the witnesses and esti- mated UFO trajectories are shown in Figure 10. The four men travelling together pulled over near the landfill at the southern edge of the Village to get a better look at the UFO. They watched the noiseless object move slowly to the northeast, curve around them to the south, and head up a valley adjacent to the mi-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 2000 Page?

At one point the UFO was partially obscured behind a nearby hill and one witness recalls the UFO slowly reappearing on the other side of it. He remem- bers waiting a long time for the last light to reappear from behind the hill; that's how slow and large the object was! The object took up about a 60 to 90 degree horizon- tal chunk of the sky. See drawings by CRM.l and CRM2 (Figures 13 and 14). CRM1 recalls hearing about the Fox Lake UFO sighting on the radio the next day and surmised that they saw the UFO about an hour and a half earlier, about 7 p.m. The family is not exactly sure what time it was when they saw the UFO, only that it was in the evening. They observed the row of lights just to the northwest of them moving slowly to the northeast. The lights were just over the treeline, and there was no noise at all. See Figure 11: Drawing by CRM7, 6 years old. Figure 11 ( drawing by'the eldest son, CRM7, six years old at the time).

With the UFO sighting occurring just two weeks prior to Christmas, the three children thought that it was Santa Claus and his reindeer in the sky. An estimate of the UFO size by triangulation was not possible for the Carmacks UFO sighting, as the geometry of the witness locations in relation to the UFO was less than ideal (see \"Estimate of UFO Size\"). Fur- thermore, it was unclear whether both the family and the group of four men in the truck observed the UFO at the same time. Perhaps the UFO made more than one pass by the Village that night. There is also some evidence to suggest that this \"sighting event\" encompassed an even larger area, as UFO reports were heard on CBC North radio the very next day mentioning sightings in the communities of Dawson, Mayo and Watson Lake. No witnesses from these additional communities have thus far come for- ward or been identified. - o- • _- o Numerous smaller white steady lights Large dark orange lights flashing In synch Figure 13: Drawing by CRM1.

Estimate of UFO Size determined by triangulation By Martin Jasek A reasonably accurate estimate of the size of the UFO (or UFOs) was accomplished through a method based on geometry called \"triangulation.\" Triangula- tion relies on the observation of an object (in this case a UFO) from at least two different vantage points at the same time. In addition to this, it also relies on an estimate of the angular size from at least one of the witnesses. One way to describe angular size is by com- paring the size of the UFO to something being held out at arm's length. An example would be \"the UFO was the size of a fist at arm's length.\" Another way to describe angular size is to compare the UFO's size to something else in the scene. An example would be \"the UFO was about twice the size of that mountaintop.\" Given the large number of witnesses and vantage points associated with this case, six separate calcula- tions of UFO size could be made. Calculation#l. A trip to the Fox Lake sighting loca-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 February 2000 MUFON UFO Journal tioh was made with FOX3. The witness showed the locations along the highway where he and FOX2 pulled over to watch the UFO. This distance was measured to be 570 metres apart. We know from FOX2's testimony that he was directly underneath the edge of the UFO at one point in time. While on location, FOX3 was asked to hold out his arms and indicate the angular size of the UFO. This distance was measured to be about 1.2 metres (4 feet) apart. The perpendicular distance from his eyes to the tip of his hands was measured to be 0.4 metres (1.3 ft). Using trigonometry, this calculates out to be about a 113 degrees of angular distance. Project- ing this angle forward the 570 metres distance to the UFO one obtains a UFO size of 1710 metres or about 1.7 kilometres (1.1 miles) in length (See Figure 2). It was also of interest to obtain the elevation of the UFO in this observation, especially since it was al- most directly overhead of FOX2. While on location with FOX3, the investigator asked him to take a pho- tograph of the scene and hold his finger at the spot where the bottom of the UFO was when it was over his cousin (FOX2). An angular height of 6.5 degrees above the ground was determined from the photograph. Using trigonometry one obtains a height of the UFO of only 65 metres (213 ft) above FOX2! This is con- sistent with FOX3's estimate of 4 or 5 lamppost heights. Calculation #2 and #3. FOX4 was presented with a photograph taken of the scene from his vantage point. He was asked to mark on the photo the length of the UFO. He was also instructed to hold the photograph 8 to 9 inches away from him in order that the angular size of the landmarks and actual scene was about the same. He gave two estimates (Figure 15). The two angles worked out to be 12.8 and 8.44 degrees angular size for the UFO. Since it was established that FOX2 and FOX3 were observing the UFO at the same time further up the lake, we know the distance to the UFO to be about 8 km (5 miles). Again, projecting those angles out to that distance, the UFO size for the two estimates worked out to be 1.8 km (1.1 miles) and 1.2 km (0.75 miles) in length respectively. (Figure 2) Calculation #4. As above, FOX5 was presented with a photograph of the scene. She gave her estimate of angular UFO size and this worked out to be 3.95 de- grees. Projecting this angle out towards the UFO 8 km (5 miles) away, one obtains a UFO size of 0.88 km (0.55 miles) in length. Calculation#5 and #6. These two calculations were based on observations by witnesses near the .Village of Pelly Crossing. PEL2 was very intelligent to com- pare the size of the UFO she observed to something in the scene.

Since she perceived the angular length of the UFO to be the same length as the Big Dipper, from the posi- tion of the stars we can deduce that the angle was about 25 degrees. (See angle projected in map shown in Fig- ure 10). Since PEL4, 5, 6, and 7 were observing the UFO at about the same time from a different vantage point, we could triangulate a location of the UFO shown in Figure 10. The estimated trajectory of PEL2 was also used for a second calculation. The second calculation would not normally be considered a triangulation since it involves observations from only one vantage point. However, some weight has to be given to the estimated UFO trajectory of witness PEL1 that is even further away from PEL2. By projecting the angle of the Big Dipper out to these two trajectory locations, one ob- tains two more calculations of UFO size. The first tra- jectory is 2.6 km (1.6 miles) away and yields a UFO size of 1.2 km (0.75 miles) in length. The second tra-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 2000 Page 11 jectory is 4.4 km (2.8 miles) away and yields a UFO size of 2.0 km (1.3 miles) in length. To summarize, \\« e have obtained the following sizes of the UFO by means of triangulation: FOX3 with FOX2: 1.7 km (1.1 miles) FOX4 with FOX2: 1.8 km (1.1 miles) FOX4 with FOX2: 1.2 km (0.75 miles) FOX5 with FOX2: 0.88 km (0.55 miles) PEL2 with PEL4,5,6,7: 1.2 km (0.75 miles) PEL2 with PEL 1:2.0 km (1.3 miles) This is consistent with witness testimony of the ob- ject appearing to be \"huge\" in the sky. Several wit- nesses gave size estimates of their own, and these were generally smaller than those obtained through the more accurate triangulation: FOX2 0.5 km (0.3 miles) based on relative size to lake width; FOX3 0.21 km (0.13 miles)-comparable to a football stadium; FOX4 0.5 to 0.7 km (0.3 to 0.4 miles)-direct estimate; PEL1 1.2 km (0.75 miles)-di- rect estimate; PEL3 0.5 km (0.3 miles); direct esti- mate. By any stretch of the imagination or calculation, this thing was BIG! Frequently-asked questions regarding the Yukon Case By Martin Jasek (Added to report - January 2000) Why has it taken almost 3 years for this case to be made public? Actually, two of the witnesses (FOX2 and FOX3) did approach a local radio station (CHON FM) the day after the event (Dec 12, 1996), and their interviews did get on the air. However, that is as far as it went. The author was not aware of this broadcast at the time. In 1998, witness CRM1 placed an anonymous call to Lorraine Bretlyn, another Yukon UFO investigator, and mentioned that his sighting in Carmacks occurred the same evening as the Fox Lake sighting that he heard described on the radio. This was our first clue that a large UFO was seen by multiple witnesses in multiple locations. However, all we knew at that point was that the incident occurred in the past few years and in win- ter conditions. On Jan. 28, 1999, FOX2 called us to describe his sighting at Fox Lake. The call was spurred by a local newspaper article describing some unrelated UFO cases. He mentioned that many of the Fox Lake wit- nesses had stopped in at Braeburn Lodge and described their sighting to lodge owner Steve Watson. Watson was interviewed, and he confirmed that fact and was able to give us about three additional witness names. These witnesses were contacted, and they in turn pro- vided additional witness names until we had a total of 22. The time period between January and October 1999 was used to locate these other witnesses, interview them, obtain their drawings, and put this report to- gether. This was complicated by the facts that most of the witnesses live a 2 to 3 hours' drive from the City of Whitehorse where the investigation is based, and some of the witnesses did not have telephones. Why are the drawings and descriptions of the UFO different? Did the witnesses see the same UFO or maybe different ones? Yes, we agree that many of the drawings do look different. It could have been different UFOs, but there could be other reasons for the differences in the draw- ings and descriptions: 1. It was two to three years from the time the sight- ing occurred to when the witnesses were asked to make their drawings. Memories do change. 2. Perhaps witnesses at different locations saw dif- ferent sides of the UFO that may have had a different number/configuration of lights. The distance to the UFO also varied, so those further away would not see certain details. 3. Different witnesses spent different amounts of time on their drawings. Some paid a lot of attention to detail, while others just provided a quick sketch. Some drawings were constructed in just seconds, while oth- ers-and one in particular-probably took more than 5 minutes. Artistic talent varied. 4. The UFO may have had certain lights turned off and certain lights turned on during that evening. It may have varied the \"on lights\" and \"off lights\" between the times when various witnesses observed it. Note: Drawings by FOX2, FOX3, FOX4 and FOX5 were very similar, with minor differences that could easily be attributable to points 1, 2 and 3 above. All these witnesses were aware of the time that their sight- ing took place, and it has therefore been established that these four were observing the same UFO at the same time. The differences in drawings of PEL2 and PEL3 could be mostly attributable to points 1 and 3. The differences between the drawing of PEL 1 and the other Pelly witnesses may be attributable to points 2"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 February 2000 MUFON UFO Journal and 4. 5. Points 2, 3 and 4 do not explain the differences in drawings by witnesses who were together during the sighting. To provide some explanation for this, one may consider the following. All the witnesses observed the UFO anywhere from one minute to several min- utes. During their observation the UFO traversed a considerable distance across the sky, thereby chang- ing their perspective view of it. It likely looked much different from these different angles. Each witness was asked to draw the UFO. One would suppose that each witness would pluck one im- age from his or her mind that corresponded to one of these perspectives. They would likely choose the one image that made the largest impression on them. This may explain the differences between the drawings of CRM1 and CRM2, and also between PEL6 and PEL7. How do you know that the witnesses are not mak- ing it up? The answer lies in the demeanor of the witnesses in their interviews. Only two witnesses approached the media or a UFO investigator-the remaining 20 had to be sought. Once found, they were reluctant to talk. However, when they were assured that their identity would not be made public, they opened up. As they were describing their sighting, apprehension was re- placed by excitement. It was like reliving the experi- ence with them. This behavior is not consistent with someone making up a story. If it were an orchestrated hoax by all these people they would not have sat around for someone to show up at their door until two and a half years later. It is not likely that they would have arranged to stop consecu- tively at Braeburn Lodge and tell a made-up UFO story to the lodge owner. I have met several times with some of these wit- nesses, often being invited into their homes. I have gotten to know them fairly well and consider many of them as friends. Among the ones I have met frequently are FOX1, FOX2, FOX3, FOX4, FOX5, PEL1 and PEL2. . Even the ones I met on only one occasion, their demeanor was consistent with that of an honest person confronted with something that they saw that they could not explain in terms of conventional means.

UFOs in History Man visited by strange object while fishing in Iowa in 1920 The following letter was received in 1974 by LeRoy R. Latham, director of the Fayette County, IA, UFO Research Group. The author of the letter was Jesse Clark Linch of Mt. Pleasant, IA, then 75 years old, who describes an experience he had in 1920 on his 22nd birthday. \"On June 3, my birthday, Mother suggested I take the day off and catch a mess of bull heads for dinner. Dinner on the farm was noon. I went fishing in the pond, was on the east bank-there was a maple grove on the west side of the pond, trees approximately 1200 feet high. There were a few low willows along the north bank, and grass on the east bank where I was. There was no wind, no clouds, the sun shone on my back as I faced west, fishing. \"The bull heads were biting, and I had caught just about enough by 10:30, approximate time, when at tree- top level out of the west came a strange object. It came in across the pond and settled gently on the grass about 15 feet south of me. It was the size like a 5 gallon cream can had been split lengthwise, rather flat on the bottom. Side view was a sky blue color. Completely noiseless. It did not alarm me, but I was curious. After 15 minutes or so I laid down my pole and thought to investigate the object. \"When I got up to pick it up, it left, slowly lifted over the trees in the west, and disappeared. Still no noise. \"I never reported this, as there was then as now a mental health asylum in Mt. Pleasant, and in those days if you heard voices or saw strange things you were put away. I never told anyone until after Arnold saw the saucers in the West. \"In a few days now I will be 76 years of age, but not a detail of that strange thing have I forgotten.

At approximately 2:20 a.m. (MST), the two officers, one an experienced helicopter pilot, the other an observer being trained as a pilot, departed Deer Valley Airport in their McDonnell Douglas, 520 N helicopter. The aircraft was flying \"without doors,\" a common procedure for pilots who are flying in warm, non-tur- bulent air space. The wind was calm, and visibility was unlimited as the helicopter ascended to approxi- mately 2000-ft. msl (mean sea level) on a routine south- bound police patrol. The helicopter was 3 miles south of Bell Rd. and 7th Avenue when the pilot (both pilot and observer wish to remain anonymous) sighted a \"single brilliant green light\" moving northbound over the western edge of North Mountain, located at 19th Avenue and Thunderbird Rd. in Phoenix. \"I first thought that it was an aircraft,\" the pilot said. \"It's common to see aircraft entering the area of Deer Valley Airport, even at that hour of the morning. Since the control tower at the airport closes at 2100 hours each evening, the in-coming and out-bound aircraft are supposed to clear themselves on the common air traf- fic frequency 118.4, for safety reasons.\" The pilot then attempted radio contact. It didn't re- spond. The fast-moving green light continued north-bound and was on the helicopter's right side at about 30 degrees above the horizon at an estimated 5000 ft. msl when the pilot turned his helicopter to an ascending right-handed climb in an attempt to identify the aircraft. The green light suddenly stopped as the helicopter began its ascent. The green light then began a counter clock-wise orbit around the helicopter from above. The pilot now suspected that what he and the observer had just witnessed was not consistent with any general avia- tion aircraft. Not only was the green light moving in a bizarre manner, the pilot and observer noticed another alarming feature: the pilot and the observer both stated that they saw no structural architecture to the light; it just appeared to be a round, green light that never wa- vered or changed in intensity or brilliance as it pro- pelled itself through the early morning sky. The pilot estimated that the green light was twice the size of the planet Venus if you were looking at it from the ground. Excited, the pilot brought the helicopter into a hover McDonnell Douglas Model 520N Helicopter mode at about 2200 msl. The pilot now wondered if the light could somehow be a reflection from their in- strument panel. He turned his helicopter to place the green light outside of his open door by tilting the heli- copter to the right in order to obtain a clear view of the object outside of their rotor dish. The pilot and the observer confirmed that they were in fact seeing the green light in clear, open airspace. As the pilot turned his helicopter to the right, the green light suddenly stopped again, then immediately began a \"clock-wise\" orbit around the helicopter in the same fashion as before, only now it was circling in the opposite direction. The pilot commented to the ob- server that the light seemed to be reacting to the move- ment of their helicopter. The observer agreed. The light now continued to orbit the helicopter, the observer es- timated between 8 to 10 revolutions in all. The light suddenly stopped again, then \"shot straight up through the air like a high-speed elevator; hundreds of feet in just a few seconds,\" the observer reported. The pilot and observer were now witnessing something that neither one of them could believe. The movement, plus maneuverability, was baffling to both of the po- lice officers. The helicopter was still in a hover, and now facing north, when the occupants watched help- lessly as the green light \"dived\" very rapidly from it's position to a south-westerly path before again chang- ing its direction to an east to west path, now at about 45 degrees above the horizon. The pilot estimated that the green light was now in the area of Yorkshire or Beardsley Road in the vicin- ity of the Interstate 17 highway. Meanwhile, the pilot contacted another Police helicopter pilot that was ap- proaching Deer Valley Airport for landing, and asked him if he had the green light in view. The pilot replied that he did not. It was then arranged that the pilot of"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 February 2000 MUFON UFO Journal the other helicopter would check the area when he landed. The pilot in the sky directed him to the exact area to check after he exited his own helicopter. The: helicopter pilot on the ground informed the pilot that he still did not see the light. Air Evacuation Helicopter # 12 was also entering the area to land at Deer Valley Airport from around 7th Street and the Pointe, just south of Thunderbird Road. The pilot of that helicopter cleared himself into the airspace and was immediately contacted by the police pilot and asked if he saw the green light maneu- vering northwest of the I-17 Interstate. The pilot of the evacuation helicopter replied that he did not. When the evacuation helicopter was in the vicinity of the Deer Valley Airport, the police pilot again asked him if he could see the green light, and the evacuation pilot was directed to the exact area of the sighting. The evacuation pilot replied that he just could not see the green light. It is interesting to note that the green light was still moving in all directions over a very popu- ated area, and over Interstate, \\1, a busy highway. As the pilot and observer continued to watch the light, the pilot then contacted the Phoenix Sky Harbor Tower and asked if they had \"painted\" the green light on radar. The operator replied that he had the tran- sponder return and the primary target (police helicop- ter) on his screen, but nothing else. FAA Approach Control was also notified, and replied that they also had the helicopter on radar, but the green light was not showing up on their radar track either. As the pilot and observer watched the green light move east to west, then north to south, they then were dispatched to a call and had to depart the area. When they returned to the area later that night, the UFO was gone. The estimated duration of the event was 10 to 12 minutes. How did this story break? Some unknown person or agency submitted an au- dio tape of the pilot's actual conversation with a sec- ond, unidentified source (i.e. tower or other aircraft) to a local radio station, KFYI. The station then played the edited clip on their morning newscast a couple of days after the incident. By Oct. 16, the story was cir- culating on numerous web-sites on the Internet. The following week a local television station did a story on the incident without interviewing the witnesses. I first spoke to the pilot on Oct. 16, and he then agreed to be interviewed. Two weeks later I interviewed the ob- server. MUFON was the only investigative UFO orga- nization to interview the police officers. The pilot later informed me that they were only comfortable with speaking to MUFON. Pilot's background The pilot of the police helicopter has extensive fly- ing experience in both civilian and military circles. He informed me that he has a total of 2,300 hours of flight time in the helicopter that was involved in this inci- dent. He also advised me that he has had over 600 hours of fixed wing flight time and 4000 hours of military aircraft experience. After interviewing the pilot and the observer, I contacted Phoenix Police Public Infor- mation Officer Sgt. Jeff Halstead, who confirmed that the UFO sighting did occur, and that he did speak to the officers involved in the incident. Jeff also gave me permission to talk to the witnesses. I then contacted radio station KFYI, the station that had played the audio clip of the pilot talking to the unidentified party about what he and his observer had just witnessed. The station eventually told me that the tape had been given to Sgt. Halstead. I then contacted Jeff and received a copy of that tape. Here is the tran- script of that tape: Pilot: \"We saw it come over the mountain, North Mountain, right around (sounds like Turf) Paradise, and it went right down the right-hand side. I'd say it was, like, about 3000 feet-extremely difficult to judge altitude. I made a turn up and into it. Thought it was an aircraft or (unreadable) with no lights on it. It maneu- vered around us, circled around us, went straight up, straight down, east, west; it did a variety of things.\" Second voice: \"That's pretty weird.\" Pilot: \"Yeah it was.\" Second voice: \"Well, given your second occupa- tion you should be quite familiar with that kind of stuff, huh.\" Pilot: \"Well, I've seen St. Elmo's Fire many, many times, you know; obviously this was not St. Elmo's Fire. It was really amazing to both of us.\" (End of script.) I attempted to make contact with the tower operator on duty that night, but found out later that he did not want to talk to anyone about this incident. In talking to the Approach Control Center for Sky Harbor Airport, I was transferred to the FAA. I requested that the audio tape from frequency 118.4 and frequency 118.7 be checked and listened to so that I could verify the conversations reported by the wit- nesses. I was told that I would have to use a Freedom of Information Act request to receive information from frequency 118.7 (Sky Harbor Tower), while frequency 118.4 (Deer Valley Airport) could be checked. The next day the FAA notified me that there was nothing on the audio tape ftom Oct. 12 at the time the incident was reported! I was perplexed by this answer. Did the FAA actually check the tape from frequency 118.4, or did they simply wish not to tell me that the conversa- tion had occurred? Questions not answered Just what did these two Phoenix police officers see"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 2000 Page 15 in the early morning sky of Oct. 12, 1999? We can rule out natural phenomena such as a meteor or bolide. They just can't maneuver with such skill and preci- sion as this light or object did. Did the Marines test some new weapon on the unsuspecting citizens of Phoenix? The pilot of the helicopter told me that an urban assault training exercise was conducted that week in Phoenix. He said that he even talked to a Marine pilot on the radio and saw them fly frequently over the city in formations of 3 and 4 helicopters at low alti- tudes. I contacted Williams Gateway Airport, which used to house training operations for fighter aircraft, but now runs on just a small crew of aviation personnel. An employee of the airport told me that the Marines were located there in October conducting training exercises, and that they were using both air and ground support, including Cobra and Chinook helicopters. Unfortu- nately, there is absolutely no evidence that an experi- mental craft was being used or tested that week, even though it is an intriguing theory. It is hard to believe that any secret testing by the military would be done so near and around a very large populace. Were there any electromagnetic effects to the heli- copter during the event? Both pilot and observer em- phatically stated that the instruments and mechanical operation of the helicopter were not affected in any way during or after the UFO sighting. Why didn't the other helicopters in the area see the strange green light? When I asked the pilot this ques- tion he told me that the helicopter landing pads have such bright lights illuminating the area that it would be very easy for them not to have seen the green light. When the police helicopter landed, it is most likely that it landed on the east pad. The pilot would have had to exit his helicopter and turn almost completely around to view the green light. The green light was moving in the northwest when the other helicopter landed. Was the Forward Looking Infrared System (FLIR) in use? The pilot told me that the FLIR was not in use because of the fact that \"I could not raise the FLIR high enough to hit it with my light, due to the almost constant 45 degree angle it was moving in.\" The video recorder was not powered on, but again the pilot stated that the light was always above them, even when cir- cling the helicopter. So what are we left with? A light in the sky, moving at high speed, then stopping, starting up again, circling, and maneuvering as though it were intelligently con- trolled, apparently reacting to the movements of the helicopter. In a sense, showing off to its audience. No vapor trail, no obvious propulsion system, and no ap- parent structure. Unfortunately, there were no ground witnesses to support the pilots' testimony, or none that have come forth. Could this be a hoax? You must take into account the testimony of the two police officers. Would they each risk their reputations and careers to report such an incident? Policemen are often ridiculed beyond belief for reporting such incidents. It is highly unlikely that they would concoct such a story. Remember, they wish to remain anonymous, yet they risked so much to tell their story. One of the most important aspects of this case is a simple one. If you assume that this light or object had to put out an extreme amount of energy to move in its strange, erratic manner, then we should assume that it would have been detected on the radar screens. That is unless some type of stealth technology was utilized. In that case we might never discover the origin of this light or object. It will most likely remain an unknown, just as the thousands of other UFO reports and sightings have been classified throughout the history of investi- gative Ufology. I will conclude my report with this statement by the pilot: \"I feel confident that, based on approximately 3000 hours of civilian flying experience, combined with approximately 4000 hours of current military flight time, that this object was not another aircraft. I base my conclusion on my unobstructed observations of its rapid heading, altitude changes, and aggressive ma- neuvering in relation to my aircraft.\" Police helicopter case report review By Bob Sylvester State Director, MUFON Arizona 1) All appropriate sighting forms are completely filled out and included. 2) Witnesses (pilot and observer) were interviewed over the phone (they would only agree to this method), and afterwards reviewed all forms and narrative for correctness.

Not Enough 'foil' to go around By Neil Morris & Ron Regehr Roswell Photograph Interpretation Team The 1995 United States Air Force report, \"Roswell- Case Closed,\" gives great play to the alleged \"MO- GUL\" high-altitude balloon flights conducted from Alamogordo, NM, in the summer of 1947 as being the source of the Roswell debris. The fact that New York University Professor Charles Moore, their key witness, states that \"there never were any Project MOGUL balloon trains launched from Alamogordo in 1947\" seems not to deter the Air Force in their quest to explain away the Roswell debris as originating from a MOGUL launch. In particular, the Air Force designates in their report Flight #4 as the probable cause of the debris found on the Foster Ranch. However, simple calculations and reasonable as- sumptions cause us to reach the conclusion that there is insufficient quantity of physical material available in Flight 4, or any other balloon launched in 1947 for that matter, to produce the extent of debris described by various witnesses to the Roswell event. NYU Flight 4 has no official record in the flight log, and is known about only by inference from a per- sonal diary kept by one of the members of the research team, Thomas Crary. The flight number and number of balloons used is not given, and only minimal details of the \"train\" makeup are listed in another portion of the USAF report. According to Crary's log, the origi- nal planned launch was scrubbed because of cloud cover, and instead a \"service flight\" to test systems was launched. Ostensibly this service flight was as- signed the moniker \"Flight 4.\" What does the USAF claim was found? They claim the debris was from an ML307C radar reflector and portions of a neoprene balloon. ML307C was a flimsy array of paper-backed foil and lightweight wooden stick supports held together by yards of string and tape. Sur- viving research team member Moore provided the in- formation used by the AF in the preparation of their 1995 report, based on Moore's memories of the time. Moore believed two or three ML307C radar reflec- tors were used on Flight 4. Therefore, we conserva- tively assume three were used. The ML307C basic con- figuration was of three corner reflectors, each con- structed from three triangular sections having 24-inch sides. The total amount of foil for each ML307C can then be calculated as 18 square feet. Flight 4 therefore had three times this amount, or 54 square feet, as it allegedly carried three ML307C's. How large was the debris field? Mac Brazel, in the July 9 issue-of .the Roswell Daily Record, claims the debris field was approximately 200 yards in diameter. But it must be noted that many people believe this in- terview was conducted after Mac had been \"coached\" by U.S. government officials, hence the smaller re- ported size. In his visit to radio station KGFL, imme- diately after his visit to the Roswell Daily Record, he said as much to KGFL reporter/announcer Frank Joyce. Maj. Jesse Marcel, another witness, said the debris field was 3/4 mile long by 200 to 300 feet wide. Other witnesses include Bill Brazel Jr. (son of Mac Brazel) and Bud Payne (who lived on a nearby ranch). They independently took investigators to the debris field, each from his own home location adjoining the Foster Ranch. Brazel and Payne came to the site from oppo- site directions. Each stopped at what would have been the start of \"their\" end of the debris field. These points, when checked, were approximately 3/4 of a mile apart, a good indication Maj. Marcel's first report was accurate, whereas Mac Brazel's esti- mated size of the debris field was roughly 1/3 that given by Maj. Marcel, Brazel Jr., or Payne. A minimum foil density is required to produce the visual effect of a \"defined\" debris field as provided by the witnesses. This minimum foil density level must have been reached to produce the descriptions given. Our calculations show we would have many pieces of foil half the size of a postal card. Each piece would occupy a space bigger than most people's living rooms- 15 by 15 feet square. Worse yet, if one uses Maj. Marcel's and Payne's description, these spaces occu- pied by foil debris would be bigger than a 2-car ga- rage! Given the amount of foil contained in three ML307C radar reflectors-54 square feet, or if a single piece, it would measure 6 by 9 feet-can we produce the den- sity reported by the witnesses? Can we make it look cluttered with that small amount of material? Do you believe it would be so cluttered that Brazel's sheep would refuse to cross the field? Further complicating the issue are the eyewitness accounts of \"clumps\" of debris. Remember, witnesses state the foil was of various sizes, many larger than our uniform test pieces. We could achieve this effect (Continued on Page 18)"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 February 2000 MUFON UFO Journal China experiencing rash of UFO sightings The past few months have been a boom time for UFO enthusiasts in China. Just before the start of the year 2000, there were dozens of sightings. Strange shin- ing objects were observed scooting through the sky by hundreds of people, from former airport workers to college deans. \"Warning Wuhan! Warning Dalian! Warning Xian! Jiangsu! Beijing! Shanghai!\" exulted the Jiangsu U.F.O. Research Society's Web site. \"Frequent UFO visits have enveloped all of China.\" Buoyed in part by the sightings, the ranks of the research societies in major Chinese cities devoted to unidentified flying objects have grown to more than 40,000 members. More important still, the normally conservative of- ficial news media have been lavishing attention on UFO news, with documentaries on the main government television station, CCTV-1, and credulous newspaper articles. \"The level of interest and acceptance is definitely rising,\" said Sun Shili, a retired Foreign Ministry offi- cial who is president of the Beijing UFO Research Society. \"Because of the frequent sightings recently in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities that have had many witnesses, even the media-which are very serious and careful-have been paying attention.\" Sun is MUFON's representative for China and a Not enough foil...

Recall we only have 54 square feet of material to work with, not an iota more-that's all the foil there is! So if we assign some of the small pieces to make up our larger pieces this means we have a few large areas with no debris at all!! Why? Because we had to use those smaller pieces from those areas to make up the bigger pieces. The more and larger the concentration on one place the thinner the distribution must be in others. Conclusion: One must concede either the wit- nesses were wrong in their judgment of the size of the debris field or the debris originated from something other than the 54 square feet of foil in the three ML307C radar reflectors, as proclaimed by the USAF. consultant in economics. Of course, in many ways it would seem a most awk- ward time for fleets of extraterrestrials to be buzzing China, what with the government jailing leaders of the Falun Gong spiritual movement and a few other groups also associated with the traditional Chinese practice of qigong exercises, for \"superstitious\" and \"anti-sci- entific\" behavior. But, so far at least, the* government has decided to tolerate the UFO craze, even if it does not financially support it. Wildly popular and politically unthreatening, UFO research is the kind of unorthodox pursuit that is allowed in China today, and government officials and citizens alike tend to view UFO research as science. Officials of UFO societies are determined to keep it that way. \"The study of UFOs is fundamentally differ- ent from other things like Falun Gong and qigong, which have come under criticism lately,\" said Jin Fan, an engineer who heads the Dalian UFO Research So- ciety in northeast China. \"This is a purely scientific field, whereas Falun Gong deals with cults and super- stition.\" Indeed, a large portion of China's UFO enthusiasts are scientists and engineers, not the sci-fi buffs or apocalyptic stargazers who are the stereotype in the United States. Many of China's UFO research societ- ies require a college degree and published research for membership. The Chinese Air Force attends impor- tant UFO meetings. \"If our conditions for membership weren't so strict, we'd have millions of members by now,\" said Sun, a foreign trade expert and cheerful intellectual who saw a UFO nearly 30 years ago. \"It was extremely bright,\" he recalls, \"and not very big. At the time I thought it was a probe sent by the Soviet revisionists.\" In his cluttered Beijing study, he proudly displays old photographs of himself interpreting for Chairman Mao, and a more recent vintage Alien Collection set containing models of a Nordic alien and of those re- portedly found in Roswell, N.M., for example. Applauding the Chinese government's \"enlightened and practical attitude,\" Sun said, \"In the U.S., schol- ars investigating this are under pressure and have been derided. But in China the academic discussion is quite free, so in this area American academics are quite jeal- ous of us.\" Sun has a theory concerning the increase in sightings in China. \"It's very possible that relatively rapid de- velopment attracts investigations by flying saucers, and here in China we're becoming more developed,\" he said. \"Generally, well-developed areas like the United States have more sightings.\""},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 2000 Page 19 Morphing not due to reflections In your December issue, Mr. Jeff Sainio, a photoanalyst for MUFON, expressed his surprise with our July 1999 article, \"Two Photo Events May Involve Same Object.\" Overall, Mr. Sainio concludes that the morphing noted in our second set of photos was most likely caused by reflections from an airplane Mr. Fisher observed during the May 3rd incident. We feel that Mr. Sainio's theory about reflections causing morphing may be possible in some isolated observations. How- ever, we believe his use of it to explain our experience is seriously flawed. Here are the reasons why: Mr. Fisher's description of that \"plane\" when viewed through binoculars was quite clear. Our article states... \"Strangely, the 'plane' was dark in color, totally si- lent, and no flashing lights, markings, motor/propeller or cockpit were visible.\" Dark planes do not reflect light well (if anything they absorb it), there were no windows to cause reflections, and Mr. Fisher's descrip- tion clearly shows that it was not your typical airplane. Mr. Sainio mentions that during the video of the plane he photographed that \"A contrail was evident; with higher air temperature, lower altitude, or a prop plane, a contrail would easily be absent.\" Mr. Fisher saw quite a bit of detail through his binoculars, and he could clearly see that the \"plane\" had no motor/propeller. The similarity of photographing a \"3-ball\" shaped object in incident 1 and a \"3-ball\" shaped object dur- ing incident 2 argues against reflection. The odds against this morphological similarity occurring twice are too high. Mr. Sainio never contacted us to examine the origi- nal pictures, nor does he mention visiting the web site address in our article, which shows the photos in color, with more detail, as well as their computer enhance- ments. As a photoanalyst, we would have expected Mr. Sainio to do more than just a cursory evaluation of the photographic evidence, including making the same due diligence effort with his photos as we did, prior to jump- ing to conclusions. In the second incident, we mentioned that a fifth picture was taken 1 second after the fourth frame was made. The object was no longer present in that 5th print. If the reflection had ended just before the fifth frame was made the \"plane\" (object) would still be present and identifiable in the last photo of that se- quence. It was not... it had blinked out. In addition, Mr. Fisher could no longer see the \"plane\" in his bin- oculars after it quickly disappeared from view. If a re- flection had been present, Mr. Fisher would have seen the \"plane\" when the reflection ended. He did not. Overall, we feel the above points make a convinc- ing argument that reflections from an airplane were not responsible for the morphing phenomenon we ob- served during the May 3 incident. We invite Mr. Sainio to evaluate our photos. Nicholas F. Schmidt, Ph.D. Gregg Fisher Apparent size is important The December 1999 Journal arrived yesterday. It upholds your fine standards and makes us proud to be members of MUFON. May I point out something I noticed particularly in the Journal this time? There were several fine accounts of recent sightings which were of high interest and well written. However, in some of them there was no men- tion of \"apparent size\" of the skyborne object(s) as viewed by the witness. Like many of your readers, I am a visual person and tend to try to \"see\" in my inner eye what I am reading, from the point of view of UFO witnesses. When no estimate of apparent size is given, it is sorely missed. Without it, it is almost impossible to visualize what the witness was seeing. The general appearance of the \"UFO\" can be determined, but the size that it appeared to the witness is often of prime importance in under- standing what was seen. When I read the December 1999 Journal, it hap- pened that I was in the midst of updating my catalog of published works. From March 1973 to September 1983 I wrote a column entitled \"California. Report\" for Skylook and, later, the MUFON UFO Journal when Skylook's name was changed. Occasionally the work of other skilled investigators would be presented in my column. I happened upon a \"California Report\" column in the July 1979 issue, guest-written by P. Wayne Laporte entitled, \"UFOs; and Apparent Size.\" For his article, Wayne contributed an excellent \"Ap- parent Size Chart.\" As Wayne pointed out, helping the witness to estimate the apparent size of the object(s) is useful in visualizing what the witness experienced. It is often useful in determining the true size of the ob- ject and its distance away from the observer by trian- gulation, provided certain other data are also available. I hope that this apparent size chart, and perhaps Wayne's article as well, can be re-printed in an up- coming issue of the Journal.

Hall As we enter Y2K (not yet a new millennium; see Walt Webb's column), it is good to see some high qual- ity investigation and scientific work being done. Even the tests done on the dubious \"Starchild skull\" constitute good science! Whether or not they are a waste of resources is another question. The Missouri investigators have done very good work on the magnetic particles found in the crop circle that was formed last July. A broader report on the case would be helpful, tell- ing us a little more about the circumstances of the appear- ance and discovery of the circle and its description. Richard Hall Were there any UFO sightings at that time? Have hoax possibilities been examined? I am skeptical about assuming a link between crop circles (especially the geometrically elaborate British kind) and UFOs. But in many past cases visibly ob- served UFOs have left circular impressions or traces on the ground, so that if a link can be established in a given case and physical evidence is present, it could prove to be very important. Kudos to JoAnne Scarpellini and Gary P. Hart. With regard to the Nova Scotia sightings reported so well by Eugene H. Prison, I am curious to know whether that town name, Reserve Mines, has mineral- ogical significance. If so, that might add some evidence to a correlation noted for 40 or more years between UFO sightings and certain types of mines and miner- als. Brazilian investigators back in the 1950s noted such a pattern there, and so have others around the world. I don't know how many readers will fully appreci- ate it, but Rose Hargrove's effort to define a Post Ab- duction Syndrome (PAS) is well worthwhile. I have a background in editing behavioral science literature, and this is the language these scientists speak. In fact, I am currently contributing to an NIH data base that makes frequent reference to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in its various ver- sions. Recognition of a discrete PAS would be impor- tant in bringing scientific attention to abduction reports. All I can say about the \"Ufology Profile\" interview with John Schuessler is, wow! If for any reason you skipped over it, I recommend that you go back and read it. John has always been a modest, quiet guy, so it is extremely interesting to hear his views on many controversial issues. It looks as if the leadership of MUFON will be in very good hands come July. He will need the patience of Job to deal with the strongly held beliefs alluded to in the article (one pertinent example of which appears in the MUFON Forum), and I think he is ideally suited by training and tem- perament for the position. Now for a comment (or a quibble) about the re- ported honeycomb structure shown in enhancements of the Lubbock Lights photographs, with reference to the letter by Dr. Burleson. His comment that \"specu- lation produces hypotheses to be tested\" is true in one sense, but misleading in another. I base this on my formal training in scientific philosophy and method. Charles S. Peirce, a philosopher, once said something to this effect (quoted from memory): \"One can stare stupidly at phenomena, but they won't arrange them- selves in any logical order without use of imagina- tion.\" In this sense, \"speculation (imagination)\" plays an important role in the scientific process. However, it is facts that require the primary focus and that determine what are reasonable hypotheses to explore. Specula- tion can be, and all too often is, overdone in the UFO field without regard to facts. I agree with Dr. Burleson that his speculations in this case are reasonable, and I disagree with Mr. Young that it is \"simply a waste of time.\" That would be true only if the hypothesis (1) was not reasonable to begin with, or (2) could not be tested. I hope he is willing to consider the arguments made in the letter. It appears to me that some good science can be done in this case. Similarly, the satellite photo taken Nov. 21, 1999, showing an apparent UFO image, reported in Filer's Files, is well worth objective study to determine its nature. Filer also reports several other startling and potentially highly important recent UFO cases which I hope will receive thorough investigation by MUFON and others. As a final note, the historical 1953 radar- jet interceptor case adds considerable spice, and some- one ought to videotape a deposition from the witness. I see a few internal problems with his story, but if it is even approximately accurate it will be important to interview him in depth. Note: Readers are certainly invited to disagree with anything I say via letters to the editor. Dialogue (pref- erably civil dialogue) also plays an important role in science."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 2000 Page 21 READER'S GLASSIFJEDS DR.

I first spotted a large white light that had many different colors moving inside of it. On closer inspec- tion I noticed a star formation behind the craft was moving with it. The lights at the back were like a tri- angle, but flying backwards. The point was at the rear and a large white light was at the front. Others also saw it. I ran back home to get my brother, and we both saw the craft was just moving over a hill, four miles away. It was still three inches wide at that distance.

MUFON Journal an Unprecedented Value MUFON is very concerned about the gradual de- crease in the number of Journals mailed each month over the past few years. We are fully cognizant that the web sites and e-mail communications are our most serious competition, as with many other print publica- tions, but there is much material in the Journal that is not found on the Internet. We took a membership survey in 1997 in which our members evaluated both the MUFON UFO Jour- nal and the organization itself. Based on this survey, many changes were made. The positive aspects of this survey are directly mea- sured in the reduced percentages of lost memberships since July 1998. The Board of Directors is not satis- fied with the loss of any subscribers, however, since MUFON at one point had more than 5,000 members. When you receive the reminder to renew your sub- scription, stop to seriously consider the value you are receiving each month in documented UFO informa- tion. Dwight Connelly, Editor and Walt Andrus, Edi- tor in Chief, are bringing you the finest UFO monthly organization magazine in the world. Personally invite your friends and relatives to subscribe to the MUFON UFO Journal, or give them a gift subscription. Funds Needed for MUFON UFO Museum In 1994, when the Bigelow Foundation was provid- ing financial help to all three members of the UFO Research Coalition, MUFON obligated itself to ini- tiate specific new programs that we could not have financed otherwise. One of these was the MUFON UFO INFORMATION CENTER AND MUSEUM located in an office complex on the main north-south highway Bypass 123 through Seguin, TX. This is a separate facility only a few blocks from MUFON's business office at 103 Oldtowne Road. The fundamental purpose of the \"UFO Information Center\" was public education for the general public and media, as well as UFO enthusiasts. It is the only UFO museum in the United States east of Roswell, NM. MUFON members from coast to coast and bor- der to border have visited the museum, including visi- tors from eight different countries. We do not charge admission, but solicit donations only. Obviously, the donations do not cover the monthly rent of $350 for the 500-square-foot facility. After the museum was assembled in 1994, Bob Bigelow abruptly withdrew his financial support in July 1995, leaving MUFON with an additional expenditure that exceeds our annual budget. Over the years MUFON has received donations that are I.R.S. tax deductible for the donor in their annual income tax report. These gifts are very much appreci- ated; however, they are far from adequate to cover the annual rent of $4200 for the museum. This is the sec- ond time that we have solicited funds for this project, because the need still exists. Since income tax time is approaching, this is an opportune time to secure a tax deduction on your 1999 return. We thank those who were so thoughtful last year. Those of you who have visited our museum recog- nize its importance and the unique displays. We have had photographs in the MUFON UFO Journal for those of you who haven't had the privilege of seeing this one-of-a-kind display. The MUFON office acknowl- edges all donations or gifts of any size with a letter that you can attach to your income tax statement. If you want to see our UFO Information Center and Museum continue to share its displays, exhibits, and photographs with people interested in learning more about the UFO phenomenon, this is your opportunity to step forward and make a generous gift consistent with your financial status. May we thank you in ad- vance for your consideration?"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 February 2000 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE ^^\"^i^s^ NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK New Officers Richard J.

Congratulations to David Gorman (Yonkers, NY), Mary Dee Jansen (Rome,GA), Fred Clausen (Lutz, FL), David M. Brown (Norcross, GA), Charles G. Reever (Truckee, CA), Thomas M. Ginther (Alton, VA), and Ralph O. Howard, Jr. (Chamblee, GA). Each of these will receive a complimentary MUFON lapel pin. People have asked, \"How can I be promoted to a Field Investigator?\" If Field Investigator Training classes are not being conducted in your immediate area, you may treat your study like a correspondence course; that is, by mail. First, you must purchase the fourth edition of the 315-page, 3-ring binder MUFON Field Investigator s Manual, the cost of which is $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling. After studying the manual and you feel confident with the procedures, please contact the MUFON head- quarters office and request the 100-question open book examination, which will be mailed to you. A passing grade is 80%. Dan Wright, Deputy Director, Investigations, has composed a new 100-question Field Investigator's Exam designed around the MUFON Field Investigator s Manual (Fourth Edition). It was intro- duced Jan, 1,2000. Kathleen Marden will continue to accept the cur- rent examination indefinitely. However, we encourage those who have not submitted their exam answer sheets to do so in the near future. Both Kathleen and I screened the new test and made appropriate revisions for clarifi- cation purposes. The format still consists of multiple choice, true-false, and \"fill in the blanks.\" NBC-TV Program Titled \"EXTRA\" In preparation for \"rating's month,\" when UFO pro- grams draw the highest ratings on television, the news and entertainment program \"EXTRA\" will feature Walt Andrus in February on one of its segments.
