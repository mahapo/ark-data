It was quiet at the \"Smith\" mobile home in a wooded area at the end of a dead end lane. Even the family dogs, which normally took their duties as watch dogs seriously and found something to yap at just ever so often, were silent. It was just about like any other Thursday night at the X Trailer Court at the edge of a Missouri college town, but an event was to occur which the Smith family will never forget. John Smith, age 41 and a long time employee at the college, was re- laxing in the living room end listening to music on a record player. -*-t had been a long day and he was about ready to turn in. Mary, the teen age daughter, went into the kitchen to the refrigerator and through the open north window heard a \"thrashing sound 11 in the direction of some scattered trees about SO feet distant. AS the sound persisted, she was a little alarmed and called to her father. As he moved to the window, she ran to the screened porch at the front of the home and locked the door, then returned to the window and both peered into the darkness. Suddenly, from above, two beams of light appeared, very bright and silvery white in color, about 50 feet from the window. The beams were about five feet apart, tapering from about four feet wide at the top to two feet at the ground. As suddenly as they had appeared, they faded out, and a bright oval form was seen. Smith estimated it to be about 12-15 feet in diameter and very near the ground. It was so bright, he had to turn his eyes away briefly. No surface details of the ob ject could be seen at this point. The area was \"lit up as bright as day\" and the thrashing sound continued with the trees moving back and forth as if in a strong wind with the exception of one which seemed to be pulled toward the ground \"with a tugging motion.\" Shortly after the entire object was visible, the thrashing noise ceased, but the \"tugging motion\" of one tree continued; then there was a loud, cracking sound and the tugging ceased. A he next morning it was seen that a large limb had broken away from the main trunk at a point 17 feet above the ground and had the appearance of having been twisted by some giant hand. As Smith moved to another window, he saw his dogs lying very quiet between the house and a shed, and was astounded that they were not barking. Alarmed by the strange happenings, he went to his bedroom for his guns and brought them to the kitchen where he loaded them and placed them near at hand at the north window where **ary kept watch. The object remained in the same position and light from its glowing form illumin- ated the trees as far away as 100 feet* Smith decided to call for help. T he object began moving away to the north, passing below tree limbs through an open area some 20 feet wide, *t moved parallel to the ground until it reached the edge of the field, then raised slightly and hovered some 200 feet from the house* The light was not as bright as before, and Smith and his daughter could now see the object was silver-white at the center with a blue band of light and an orange glow extending to the outer edge. It hovered briefly, then moved back with a smooth, slow motion to its original position over the field. At no time could any sound be heard from the strange craft. Smith dialed the trailer court for directory assistance. Mrs. Brown, who took the call, later told Ted Phillips that Smith was very excited and seemed to be frightened as he described the event. H e told her he needed help and asked her to contact the police. She said she would"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"call the operator et the telephone company and ask her to call Smith at once* While Smith had been talking to Mrs. Brown, the house lights dimmed twice. As he completed his call, he hung up and went back to the win- dow, Mrs. Jones, on duty at the telephone company, received Mrs. Brown's call and immediately dialed the Smith home, •'•here was no busy signal, no ring, and, in her opinion, as she told Mr. Phillips later, the line was dead. She tried dialing the number five times, pausing after the third or fourth call to check back with Mrs. Brown to be sure she had the right number. After the fifth try (she stated that it would have taken perhaps three minutes to dial five times, waiting briefly after each dial and contacting Mrs.Brown) she did get through. During this time Smith was concerned as no one had called back, and it is understandable how the minutes could seem very long in such a situation. H e picked up the receiver to try to call again and heard the operator call his name. He told her what had happened and said he was frightened for his children, interrupting his report to ask his daughter if the thing was still outside and what it was doing. Both operators told Phillips later they felt he was entirely sober and was telling the truth. There was no doubt as to his obvious alarm and sincerity. Mrs. Jones then contacted the FAA at the regional airport and the person on duty there listened to Smith's story and was also impressed by his fright and sincerity. Smith was told the police would be con* tacted and hung up. The time was exactly 12:53 as stamped by the electric clock as the call was logged at the Flight Station. At this time the object was moving toward the Smith home, and his alarm grew. As he stated when interviewed by Phillips, \"It came back, and we had it, I'll tell you. We didn't know what to do; we both got kind of scared. I said, 'What's gonne happen? Something's gonna happen here.! 1 This cold feeling came over me, J got speechless at this time. I just had this cold feeling when it came back that second time. I was just sure, like you almost feel that you were gonna get killed or something! Like death was at you, this was it! I didn't know what to do, I just froze. I just knew that this was it and no one would come, no policeman. I was scared to go out the door, I wouldn't have gone outside, no way.\" The object then moved away, through the trees, toward the field. There was no sound, and this time the trees did not move. As the ob- ject neared a point at the near edge of the field, it raised slightly until it reached a point over the field some 200 feet away. It was still below the tree line to the north* As it hovered there, the orange and blue bands could be seen again with the silver-white center. The glow then becan to \"shrink,\" Smith said, until the object completely disappeared and was not seen again. The police arrived about 1;45 a.m., explaining the delay was due to a bad accident in the area. One young officer walked to the area with Smith, looked about briefly and seemed unimpressed. H e did not see the broken limb at that time, and it seems possible he did not see the deep imprints left in the ground. Some lighter markings on the ground he dismissed as \"rabbit tracks.\" Disturbed at having this frightening experience dismissed so lightly, Smith told the officer, \"Just forget the whole thing.\" He then called the Flight Service Station to report the police had been there. Ted Phillips interviewed the Smiths first on July 9, 1973, getting their story and taking measurements and photographs of the site visited by the object. The broken limb described earlier was still hanging from the tree trunk, and there were other broken limbs and tree damage."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Leaves in the area of the broken limbs had a scorched appearance , up to 25-35 feet above the ground.

Editor's Note: We can't remember the specific case and haven't time to search back issues at this time, but we're sure we do remember another landing case in which the police were slow in reaching the scene because of a bad accident in the area. Just coincidence? This might be a subject for investigation in the future. MUFOH Consultant Advises Study Ron Westrum, our sociology consultant, recommends that field in- vestigators be familiar with some of the vagaries of eye-witness test- imony. They should, at one time or another, peruse a book on the psy- chology of testimony— they may be shocked at how inaccurate experiments have shown even experts to be. The best source is still Hugo Muenster- berg's \"On the Witness Stand\" (1915) but not all libraries will have it. A good investment is James Marshall \"Law and Psychology in Conflict\" (Anchor Books, Doubleday 1969) for $1.45* Either of theae works will dispel the idea that eyewitness testimony is necessarily superior. 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Many See \"Thing\" In Tennessee Sky - What Is It? The August 5th edition of \"The Knoxville News-Sentinel^ gives headlines to a front page report on \"the thing\" seen in the skies above LaFollette, Term., since July 5th. More than 50 persons, including the serious-minded mayor have reported seeing the object variously described as a rounded light, usually orange in color, that moves a few hundred feet above the ground in a north-to-south direction, appearing usually around 9:50 p.m. Some joke about it. u thers including an Oak Ridge scientist, take it seriously. More than 100 Citizen Band radio operators discuss the \"thing\" and maintain their own skywstch report on sightings over a wide area. Radio reports keep the interested public up to date. In Knoxville, Mrs. James H. Guyton, Jr., a lawyer, 7141 Cheshire Drive, told of seeing a \"large ball of fire\" due north of her home at 12:30 a.m. July 22. She said, \"We had just turned TV off and gotten in bed when a bright, flickering flame appeared outside our second story bedroom window. I thought our sunporch roof was on fire! I ran and pulled aside the curtains and saw the object just over the trees. By the time my husband reached the window It had disappeared. Although he said he saw a puff of smoke, ^ didn't have my glasses on, so saw no smoke.\" \"it's not a star, not a plane, not a weather balloon, nothing natural,\" said Mayor James P. Freeman from atop Knob Hill, a 1700 foot knoll over- looking La Follette from the south. While the mayor and a group, including the reporter from the ^ews- Sentinel and another skywatch group, headed by Radio Station WLAF's news director, Frank Epperson, were looking for the thing and saw nothing, back at the radio station, a call came in from a woman who lives on U.S. 25 North, saying the light was over Peabody Mountain. The mayor, who is also police commissioner, raced with telescope toward Jackboro and parked near a drive-in theater on the 4-lane highway, but the object did not appear. But the mayor—in company with his two sons and Bill Russell, a high school biology teacher—did see the object while fishing on Cove Lake late in July. J-t was an orange light, about 1/3 the size of a full moon, on the side of Pine Mountain below Interstate 75- ^t moved behind trees and reappeared in a gap, then vanished, Mayor Freeman said. A driver for Tennessee ^ighway Department headed his dump truck to- wards Huntsville, near the Cambell-Scott Bounty line and reported both he and his companion were attracted to an orange glow moving in the opposite direction, hovering over the highway and moving toward Cary- yille. It disappeared in an instant. The driver said he had met no vehicles. K. C. Haaland, chemical scientist at Oak Ridge National laboratory, told the News-Sentinel he didn't know what the object was rt but I'm con- vinced from what reliable people who have seen the mysterious thing tell me it is something unusual. I'm not taking the reports lightly* Some think the light may be just a reflection, but Haaland talked to a woman who said she had seen the object in the daytime. Another theory ia that the object is a weather balloon. Those who have seen the object do not accept that nor do they go along with explanation it could be the landing lights on jets dropping into the Knoxville airport—with the jet engines idled in the descent and the noise less noticeable and far behind the aircraft lights. Bob Hewlett, a field investigator for MUFON, is among those continuing an investigation, and perhaps we'll have a solution for the next issue of SKYLOOK. Or—will the mystery deepen?

Andrus Editor's Note: Mr, Andrus' article was airmailed from Tulsa, Okla., in plenty of time to reach SKYLOOK before the deadline for copy, but did not do so, so could not be included in the August issue* As promised in the July issue of SKYLOOK, the following is an up date report of the progress being made in the investigation into the 1697 newspaper report of the crqsh of ah airship and the subsequent burial of the pilot's body in the Aurora cemetery. Through the out- standing investigative work of Bill Case, Aviation Writer for.the \"Dallas Times Herald 11 newspaper and MUFON State Director for Texas, with the able assistance of Earl Watts, MUFON Field Investigator and State Director of Astronomy, the following facts are submitted as evidence that H. E. Hayden's original story to both the Dallas and Fort Worth newspapers cannot be considered a complete hoax as some people have implied. We have tape recorded the statement by C. C. (Charlie) Stephens, of Aurora, Texas, that his father, James Stephens was \"an eye-witness to the crash of an airship on the crash site.\" Mr. Stephens, however, holds firmly that his father mentioned no body in connection with the crash although he did not visit the scene until the next day after correspondent H. £. Hayden reported it was buried in Aurora cemetery. Mrs. Mary Evans, age 91r now of Newark, Texas, who lived in Aurora at the time of the incident, stated in a tape recorded interview with Bill Case that she recalls her family and friends talking about the crash, although she, being only 15 years old at the time, was not allowed to go to the scene. (Her mother and father did view the crash site.) During a second interview with Mrs. Evans, she told Mr. Case that a \"body was recovered and a piece of the aircraft was stuck up as a marker\" in the cemetery* A grave was found with the aid of a metal detector in the Aurora cemetery in en area where cemetery records were incomplete and did not identify either the owner of the plot or the person buried in the grave A small triangular shaped native sandstone marker has existed on this f rave for n at least 65 to 70 years and probably longer\" per town marshal . R. Idell, and other residents of Aurora* The only identification on the stone was a scratched drawing of an object that looked like the front of a UFO having three round portholes or windows. After the photograph of the marker under an old oak tree appeared in the \"Dallas Times Herald,\" someone stole the marker on June 14, 1973. Even tho we have disclosed a few slight discrepancies in H. E. Hayden 1 s original newspaper account, it cannot be divorced from the fact that it was \"one of more than 500 airship sighting reports\" published in Dallas and Fort Worth newspapers from April Ik through April 27, 1#97. An often asked question is \"What happened to the reported pilot's log written in hieroglyphics?\" No mention can be found of it other than in the original story. What additional scientific facts are available to substantiate the probability that a crash of an aircraft on the former Judge J. S. Proctor's homestead did indeed occur? This property is now owned by Brawley Oates and his wife Bonnie. One of the earlier metal samples dug up at the alleged crash site was analyzed under the direction of one of MUFON's very capable consultants and found to be an aluminum alloy. An alloy of this composition was not developed in laboratories in the-United States until between 1903 and 1910 and not commercially available until 1920. Our consultant stated that the metal.bad been subjected to extreme heat and was probably in a molten condition 7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"since specific elements were forced to the surface of the aluminum alloy nugget. Other metal samples were retrieved, using metal de- tectors at the possible crash site that were a four inche.s under the surface and imbedded^into the limestone on the hillside. These pieces of metal also indicated they could have been in a molten con- dition when deposited, since they conformed to the configuration of the limestone. Samples of these metals were sent to John *. Schuessler, Deputy Director of MUFON and Consultant in Astronautics, on June 15. They have been submitted to laboratories at McDonnel-Douglas in St. Louis for their expert analysis. Other samples were mailed to Prof. William A. Funkenbusch at Michigan Technological University in Koughton Michigan at his request- for study by their faculty. Preliminary investigation indicates a high probability that an ex- plosion did take place on Judge J. S. Proctor's homestead which gives credibility to a possible crash. Why is MUPON interested in this particular case? If H. E. Hayden's newspaper report is correct, we have possible access to pieces of a crashed UFO and hopefully some remains of a body in the cemetery grave. Our goal is two fold in nature; first to either prove that the story was a pure fabrication of H. E. Heyden and a hoax; or second, if it actually happened, to carry the investigation to a scientific con- clusion based upon available evidence. Previous investigations into this legend over the years have been only cursory in nature and imme- diately branded a hoax, since no one took the time to conduct an in- depth study as is presently being done by MUFON. If scientific evi- dence exists to prove that the story is a hoex, MUFON will go \"on record,\" and close this case permanently. However, if the evidence warrants continued investigation, as it no* appears, it will be carried to a conclusion in as far as we may legally extend ourselves. A registered letter was sent by MUFON to each member of the Aurora Cemetery Association requesting their permission to exhume the identi- fied grave to determine if remains existed that would either confirm or dispel the original story. Through their attorney, they not only refused to permit such an exhumation, but forbid ufologists and KUFON in particular from entering the cemetery. Due to the tremendous interest in this case, the news media in the United States and Canada requested that Bill Case and MUFON release a statement of our progress. On July 13th, Walter H. Andrus,. Jr. Director of MUFON, personally answered these inquiries to the Dallas Times Herald newspaper and appeared on the following television and radio\"stations: KRLD radio (one hour tape), KDFW-TV (filmed news broadcasts), WFAA-TV (live on noon news), in Dallas; WBAP-TV (live on evening special) and a WBAP radio (25 minutes tape) in Fort toorth. Bill Case and Earl Watts are to be commended for arranging this outstanding exposure to the public for MUFON. In severe! of the broadcasts, MUFON's Director appealed to the Aurora Cemetery Association and the residents of Wise County to permit the exhumation of the grave so as to \"wrap up\" this case and eliminate any further escapades through their well maintained cemetery by curio- sity seekers and ufologists. On Saturday July 14, Walt Andrus met with Glenn McCrary, President of the Aurora Cemetery Association, and Lloyd McKinnon, member of the association in the Aurora cemetery for a 2-hour discussion. These gentlemen are very sincere about preserv- ing their cemetery and fully accept their responsibilities to their community for preventing further damage. Both Mr. McCrary and Mr. McKionnon, who had been expecting my visit to the cemetery, maintained their position that they would not permit"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"the possible body to be exhumed or, as stated through their attorney, Mr. W. A. Nobles, of Decatur, Texas, in writing to MUFON. However, both gentlemen did agree if legal action was taken through their attorney (\"going over their heads\" as they explained), they would certain.lv give the proposal further consideration. Since the personal appeal was ineffective, legal steps become the only alternative. Before MUFON solicits legal assistance to seek exhumation of the grave, we must have scientific and legal evidence to justify such a serious move, We still need the complete analysis of the metal samples submitted to various labs in the United States and Canada as further scientific evidence* Lawyers are available in Texas to represent MUFON when this becomes the next step. Walt Andrus visited the site of the alleged crash on the property of Brawley Oates, taking documentary photographs and interviewing both Brawley and his wife, Bonnie. Bill Case, in his 27 trips to Aurora, has conducted a very thorough interview with the residents, so DO attempt was made during my visit to locate each of the contri- butors to duplicate their reports. Both Mr. ^cCrary and Mr. McKinnbn are firm believers that the entire story is a hoax. As Mr. McKinnon points out, there is no record in the written history of Wise County, Texas, concerning the crash of such an airship in 1397. H e believes that this should have been significant history if it indeed took place. FOLLOW-UP, as of August 17th, 1973, by Walt Andrus:—Metal analysis details have been received from several laboratories where investiga- tions have been conducted by metalurgists, physicists and chemists to determine the composition of pieces of metal imbedded under ground on the limestone surface atthe alleged crash site. '1'he different samples recovered by Bill Case and Earl Watts, through the aid of a metal de- tector, all show evidence of having been heated to a molten state when they were originally deposited. Basically, the samples are of an alum- inum alloy, varying, from an aluminum content of 65% to 95# and iron content from 2$% down to 5#. ^ther elements are present in small quant- ities in certain of the submitted samples.. Reports have been received from three aerospace company labs, one university and one private epectro-chemical research lab in four different states* The uniqueness of the metal has excited the interest of the metalurgists who are ask- ing more questions in an effort to determine the origin or manufacturer of the aluminum alloy* It is believed by many that our universe is made up of the same elements found on our Earth; therefore, we are not looking for an un- known element that might be evidence of extraterrestrial origin.'We are searching for positive evidence of a combination of elements, or an alloy that has never been produced or manufactured on this Earth* If the con- tinued lab investigation discloses such an alloy it will provide the evidence to seek further support of this interesting case by seeking a court order to exhume the alleged remains in the suspected grave in the Aurora, 'i'exas, cemetery* Legal aid has been volunteered when and if exhumination is the next logical step. As new information becomes available, it will be reported in SKYLOOK. Don't Miss ThisII DON'T MISS THIS!

Rittenhouse, of Huntington, Ind., sent us a clipping from a Ft. Wayne, Ind., newspaper (\"The News Sentinel\"?) ' of June 23, 1973 which states the residents of eastern Allen Bounty have reported sightings of unexplained sky objects. One resident reported seeing a large hovering aerial object de- scribed as round or pear-shaped with four or five red lights on top and bottom and a large white light atop, ^-t was dome shaped at top and rounded at bottom with what appeared to be a partitioned frame within the window. Another resident said she saw the object while enroute to a food market, For awhile it was above her auto at a height estimated at equivalent to a block or two. After moments it suddenly took off eastward at unbelievable speed, gradually disappearing. Lights on the object dimmed gradually before its departure. This was at 10:30 PM on June 20. An object sighted northeast of Ft. Wayne was described by some as being visible for a couple hours, moving in various directions and with a yellow light. The control tower at Baer Field said at that time that a pilot sighted an object but that it wasn't identified, but it was not a weather balloon, Boys Report Strange Sky Ob.iect - Law Officers Scoff - Jeff Trigg,\\l6, Pete Kistner, 18, Dena Boucherie, 14, and ^erry Stallings, 14, of Fairfield, 111-* saw an illuminated object shaped like a \"flat foot- ball\" near Fairfield Airport about 10 P.M., July 6, as they were on the road to Miriam, 111. Earlier, about 3 P.M. the same object was seen by Tommy Hutcheson, 16, and Loren Farmer, 16, near the Drive. In^ Theatre and Fairfield Gun ^lub, as it passed over their car heading- toward Geff, 111. The boys located the sheriff and his deputy at the ^egal $ Inn at Fairfield and reported the sighting. The men went outside to look, saw nothing, and made light of the boys' report. Tommy and Loren returned to the site where they had seen the object, spotted it again to the west and then followed it to Geff where it was then lost to view behind some trees. The boys said the object was football shaped, with red and white alternating lights around it and *ras the size of a half dollar held at arms length. Mrs. Alice Hearle, of Cisne, 111., talked to the boys and sent us the report. She says the object could have been a small private plane or weather balloon, but the boys were unable to identify it. SKYLOOK would be interested in knowing if others in the area saw the object. Did Saucer Make Return Visit? - Early in July, this year, something apparently landed or struck the Howard Groves 1 bean field near Clarion, Iowa, causing a mysterious depression several feet in diameter and a foot deep. Inside the depression Groves says he found fragments of a silver-like metal. Just outside the depression he found four holes which he thinks could have been made by the legs of a landing craft ..of some sort. And for forty yards around the depression the bean plants' were wilted and brown, as if they had been burned by an intense heat. Just a year ago to the day. Donald Slaikeu, u ofGoldfield, had the same thing happen to one of his bean fields. H e found the same kind 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"of mysterious depression, holes, and wilted beans on his own farm 14 miles west of the Groves 1 field. Wright County Sheriff Robert Shaw, who investigated the mysterious depressions on the Slaikeu's farm last year and on Groves 1 farm this year says, \"The two situations are identical* There appeared to be an intense extreme heat for a short period of time. Something disturbed the ground violently.\" Sheriff Shaw says he doesn't believe in flying saucers, but adds, \"It's so much of a coincidence, the same thing happened exactly one year later and only 14 miles away. . you begin to wonder about all sorts of things.\" Farmer Groves doesn't believe that lightning or a craft like a helicopter could have caused the damage to his bean field, but he doesn't go so far as to say a flying saucer actually landed on his farm. \"I've got to see those things from outer space before I'll believe in ! em, n he said, \"but it is rather puazling,_don't you think?\" He adds this to the mystery: \"My wife and ± went down to a ballgame in Wbolstock on July 3. When we got home our dog, Ginger, ran into the house and absolutely refused to come out* My wife had to drag him back outside. Ginger's never acted that way before* Cars or lightning never scared her like that before. Something's gotten into her, that's for sure.\" Credit; D. R. Marks.

Glowing Ob.lect Seen in Canada - Lucy Bakay, of Montreal, Canada, looked out the window at 8:45 PM, April 17, 1973, and saw a large \"fuzzy, glowing object\" coming out of the southeast and moving to the northwest. It was the \"size of the moon\" and perhaps larger, oval- shaped with a dark, rim around its center. The color was \"a misty, off white.\" She viewed the object through a 7x35 Wide Angle Tasco binocular and Judged it to be 600-700 feet above the ground at a distance of 1500-2000 yards. It moved slowly and was in view for three minutes. In reporting to SKYLOOK, Miss Bakey added, \"There are no real swamps in the area around here.\" More Light on Piedmont Lights - Laurence P. Rybak, of Woodridge, 111., and State Section Director for MUFON, along with two friends, throws a little light on those controversial Piedmont, Mo., sightings. He writes: \"While we were in Piedmont on June 23, 1973, we sat on top of the dam /Clear-water Lakejfrom approximately 9:30 until 4 AM. We met some elaerly people who had stated to us they had witnessed 2 UFOs swoop down and hover over the lake for a few minutes, then dis- appear. Upon further questioning they said that it had just appeared hovering over the water and hadn r t swooped down at all, but they had Imagined this is how it appeared. Well, approximately at 9=45-10:00 one of the people stated, 'There's one how. 1 Upon looking up, we realized that what they had been seeing were nothing more ;than satellites traveling in an approximate South to North direction. There were two sightings like this, and the people stated that this is what they had been seeing for nights. Also, pertaining to the same people, about 3 a.m. one of my friends noticed a ball which looked like a headlight of a car hovering over the lake and then suddenly moving across the lake. Upon further evaluation with the use of our binoculars, we discovered that this was just a fishing boat showing their headlight hovering due to charcoal smoke hovering over the lake, with the light reflecting off the water and above the light layer of smoke. After a minute or two of moving, the light 'mysteriously' went out. Apparently the fishermen had moved to a new spot. This, I believe v would explain what the people had spoken to us about.\" However, Mr. Rybak and his friends also saw a sky object which they 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"were unable to identify. Between 2:30 and 3:00 AM. they say an oval- shaped yellow light, the size of a pencil eraser at arms length) in the northern sky, moving along the horizon to the southeast and disappearing from view in a haze* It could be seen for 3-5 minutes as it moved along 20-30 degrees above the horizon. Mr* Rybak .states he does not know of any aircraft that would fit the pattern and size of the object, especially considering its great speed. Editor's Note: Our readers will remember that Reg Bone, coach of Clesrwater high school, two assistant Piedmont team managers and three players returning home from a basketball tournament saw a UFO off of Route 49 near Brushy Creek, the night of Feb. 21, 1973. All had a good look at the bright, but silent, flying object. The sighting was reported in the news media all over the United States and abroad (in the April issue of SKYLOOK, then with other follow-up reports) along with a flurry of other reports of UFOs in the Piedmont area. The sightings were investigated by MUFON and reported in SKYLOOK. We believe Coach Bone and his group saw a real unidentified flying object, while it seems that many who reported UFOs saw easily identified lights in the sky. That this should be true is perfectly natural and in no way implies disrespect to the many who made honest reports of objects they were unable to identify. Today, six months later, this magazine still receives letters asking about those Piedmont UFOs, and we con- tinue to invite further information concerning them. In this reference, we believe you'll find the next report especially interesting. Mysterious Light Seen from Bedroom Window - On the nights of April 19- 20, 1973, a mysterious light which \"looked like fire\" and appeared to be as large as a small home was seen by Mr. and Mrs. 0. S. Hahn at their home on Possum Creek near Lutesville, Mo* Mrs. Hahn told \"The Banner Press\" of Marble Hill, Mo.the huge light was first seen outside the bedroom windows about 10 p.m. The light illuminated the entire bedroom through the curtains* The Hahns didn't go outside, but she said she felt cattain the entire area around that side of the house was illuminated because the light was so bright \"it hurt my eyes,* she said* The next night at 3 a.m. she was awakened from her sleep with a bright light shining in her face* wi t really scared me,\" she said. Both nights the light stayed at the window for about 30 minutes. The first night the light appeared to zigzag as it lowered toward the earth* \"I guess it landed because it was getting lower when I closed my eyes because they were hurting; and when 1 opened them, the light was gone,\" she said* She described the light as reddish, looked like fire and appeared to be round in shape and was \"very big, half as big as a home*\" Asked if the light could have been car lights froifl a road nearby, Mrs. Hahn said definitely not. She said she is familiar with car lights and this is out of the question* Asked if it could have been the moon, she likewise ruled this out because the moon is small in size compared to the huge light and is not nearly so bright. She said she didn't think of the mysterious lights seen at Piedmont until some time afterward and decided this must have been the same thing that had been reported elsewhere. Her husband, a retired oil distributor, saw the light with her both nights and is likewise baffled by it all. Interested in this incident, the Banner-Press went back in their files to recount a happening five years ago. F. X. Peters and Gus Eftink and their families reported this one to the press. It was on a February night about 9:30 or 10 p.m. when his dogs began barking. \"They were having a fit, just going crazy,\" said Peters, add- ing that none of the others could hear a thing. Before long, a huge 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"elongated object dropped from the sky and had a white light on top of it and a red light and a green light on the ends of it. \"It was as big as an Elfrink truck,\" said Peters and was shaped like a long green watermelon. nj -t came down about 200 yards from our house in a field which was between a wooded area and our home, so we could see it good.\" Peters recalled that he and many others saw it land and saw it take off. It went straight up. Sometime later a spot was found where it apparently landed and the earth was sunken in three places, much like a tripod landing gear would make, and there was no growth of grass where the sunken places were. The earth appeared to have been burned at those three spots, Peters said. L. T. Wilder, cons -. -. ..-.-«^*, conservation agent, was called to the scene by Peters to inspect it. Peters said the sunken spots were about 20 feet apart. Peters said the landing site is in a 20-acre field, about 30 or 40 feet from a fence row. It is the highest ridge in the county and landed close to a marker placed by a geological survey team* Peters said they didn't worry too much about this, however, when a weather balloon was found some time later in the area. Comment: We'd like to know if the weather balloon fitted the de- scription of the object described and if it could have been responsible for the high pitched sound which the dogs obviously heard. Does a weather balloon having landing gear, and could it burn the ground? We'd like to know.

But after hearing a report from a person in town whom we believe, there has to be something to it* This all happened Jan* 13, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening. This fellow was driving by Sam Dieck's farm on Highway G, going toward Marion, when he looked to his left and saw a red light in the sky. He didn't think too much about it, but then noticed that it was going so slow and was too low for an airplane. He said he blinked his eyes a few times, but it was still there. The object was just ahead and to the left and he could see two big red lights, one on each side, and an after-burner (like jet stream) coming out of the back. He said it was saucer shaped and looked like there could be windows on the sides, but thought it might just be reflections so wouldn't swear to that. It crossed the road between Doug Brandenburg's and Vernori Krueger's and then swung toward Marion over Rueben Hduschultz's home. As he turned on Highway 110, the object started back toward Krueger's farm and as he got there it dis- appeared over the hill behind the old May farm. n e said he did not just imagine it, that he actually saw it and reported it to police. Phantom Glow Eludes Deputies - Sheriff's deputies chased a phantom glowing red object in the sky north of Vancouver Sunday night but found nothing. A dispatcher at the sheriff's office said several calls were received about the \"glowing\" object. One caller said it was observed from Hazel Dell, but other callers had observed it much farther north. No explanation for the observances was fqund. Credit: Bruce Melton.

The two went outside to see if they could locate the source of the sound. The sound seemed to be from the sky, but trees blocked their vision and shortly afterward the sound faded into the distance. The sky was overcast with a low ceiling. Later that day, Mrs. Randall was interested in finding this item in the \"Police Beat\" of the \"Telegraph Herald\" : \"At 1:30 a.m. police received a report than an unidentified flying object was sighted over Murphy Park.* Murphy Park is four blocks from the Randall home.

Mo. —\" * * about 9:15 p.m. our lights started getting dimmer. And I saw a flashing object coming from Maiden over Risco toward New Madred. It was a bright light, not any color. It was flashing like a policeman's light on a car, as if the object was twirling. As this was occuring, our lights were getting dimmer. We turned them off and the object's flashes were thrown into the room facing the course of the object. And then it disappeared behind some trees. I am sure this was not a plane.

July 13 (See page 13 of August SKYLOOE) and stated that Joseph Brill, of our staff, would interview the witnesses on their return from California. We now have i ; ir. Brill's report. The sighting took place at 3:30 AM and lasted about ten minutes. We quote Mr. Stice when he was asked how he happened to observe the object. \"Well, we were sleeping at the time. Our dog started barking, ^f course, he'll bark every night if en animal comes up close to the house. But he had a strange bark, just a scared bark. That's the main reason I got up to see what was going on. n e wouldn't leave the porch area, and he kept barking at that light. He just stood there and barked. Normally, if there's something out there, he'll just take off after it. But he was scared and you could tell it. The dog is always left outside of the house at night. I didn't go any farther than the porch and my wife stuck her head out of the door just once. Other than that she watched from behind the door.\" Asked to describe what they had seen, Mr. Stice said: \"After the dog woke us up, we went to the front door and opened it. We looked out and didn't see anything at the time. I went back to bed myself. My wife saw the light over there. Then 1 got up and as soon as I saw it, I just knew what it was. -1 'here wasn't any doubt in my mind. There wasn't any noise, and there wasn't any wind, just peaceful, quiet. J-t was in view for a long time. I'd say around ten minutes. It was about the size of the average car. It wasn't round and it wasn't really oval. It was kind of egg shaped or kind of oblong in shape. When it left, it moved in a northwest direction and approxi- mately three minutes or so later, our neighbor's dogs started bark- ing. I immediately telephoned Baldwin Airport in Quincy, but they"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"didn't seem as if they were in the least interested* They suggested that I call *>cott Air Force Base. \"As for the height above the ground, the newspaper said it was 100 feet from the ground but that was wrong, 1 would say it was more like 20 feet or less above the ground. I estimated this because it was about half the height of a tree from the ground. It was located behind a tree and this made it good to judge how close it was to the ground. There is a clearing where it was setting* \"The color of this thing was hard to describe. If wasn't quite the color of the sun as it goes down and yet it wasn r t dark enough to be red. It seemed to have a different color towards the center, It seemed to be more of an orange around the outside of it. ^t had a three di- mensional look to it. It just looked like you could look right through it, or right into it. ^t was brighter on the inside than it was on the outside.\" Asked how the object appeared as it left the area, Stice said: \"That was really strange. When it left, it looked like it just went straight without raising or without lowering. It just seemed to go straight, well, Just a slight rise maybe. Straight through the trees to the north- west.. It flew at the same level or near to it as it had been all the time I watched it. It didn't move faster than five miles an hour. \"It left when my wife began turning on the lights inside the house. I was standing on the porch and she was standing just inside the front door. It did seem to flicker or maybe flutter a little when it began to move off. Then, real slow it started moving out. x kept listening close for any sound, but there wasn't any sound at all* It moved away at a slow and steady speed and it disappeared. Once it started to leave, it took about 20 seconds before I could no longer see it, as it was far behind the trees. And when x say it flickered when, or Just before it moved off, I mean like your car's headlights will do when your engine is idling and then you step on the gas.\" He also added that \"the cows were bellowing on the hill** along with the dog barking.The night was calm with clear skies and a slight breeze out of the east* Editor's Note: One gets the \"feel\" of the situation so much better when you have the observer's own words, and we think Mr. Stice did a fine job of giving us the whole picture* The report forms used to record a sighting have their value, but we greatly prefer the narrative form of reporting.

(30/32 Grays Inn Road, London, WC1, England). The vast scope of Drake's research is immediately apparent on reading the book and checking his quite extensive bibliography. Some of his personal views may seem a bit too \"contactee-oriented\" for some, but it is the bulk of his data which is so impressive.

It will be visible in the morning sky near the constellation Leo at that time with the aid of a small tele- scopa. However by Nov. 1st it will be visible to the unaided eye, rising about li hours before twilight. It will be fairly bright by the end of November. A s it nears the position of the sun, it will be lost until it reappears in the evening sky just after sunset. ?hia will take place around January 1st. On December 28 the comet will pass around the sun at a distance of 13,200,000 miles. It will be a spectacular sky object reaching its brightest point on January 15th and should be as bright as the planet Venus, perhaps much brighter. It will be visible to the unaided eye until February 17th. We will keep you informed as to its location in the sky in future issues of SKYLOOK.

Bright Ob.lects Seen with SKYLAB Were Space Junk. - In answer to our question re the bright objects seen when viewing Skylab (see August SKYLOOK, page 12), Merk Herbstritt informs ue an article in the August 1973 SKi & TELESCOPE entitled \"Amateur Observations of the Skylab Procession\" states The Fernbank Science Center near Atlanta, Georgia, used a 36 inch Cassegrain Reflector to view Skylab at about 9:42 EOT, May 14, and saw seven bodies of which No. 4 was the space laboratory. The first was probably the S-II secondstage, the last the meteoroid shield that had torn loose and others were parts of the nose cone protective shroud. The seven objects varied in brightness. As of May 20, 12 objects were associated with Skylab. 17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Many Attended Carlyle Lake Picnic Those present do not need to be told the Carlyle Lake Picnic, held July 21-22 at Carlyle Lake in Illinois was a big success. The skywatch planned for Saturday night was a \"wash out\" as observation posts had just been set up when the rains came* The all day picnic on Sunday was well attended with more than one hundred people present, and no one had trouble locating the picnic area as Bill Christian, of St. Louis, had painted large, attractive sign to point the way, and there many smaller signs. Brightly colored balloons decorated the shelter house and a four foot weather balloon bobbing in a breeze from the lake caught everyone's attention. Everyone brought baskets of food and Rosetta and Dick Holmes, hosts for the 5th annual event, again cooked home made noodles, dipping them hot from the kettle into waiting plates. \"Rosie\" acted as Mistress of Ceremonies during the afternoon program. Lou Parish, slated to be the main speaker, was unable to be present as a \"bug\" (not the Watergate variety) got to him the day before, and he telephoned his regrets. Clarence Dargie spoke on \"UFOs In History* and we have received many favorable comments on his address. Walt Andrus. Joe Brill and John Schuessler also spoke and all had the attention of everyone present. Mrs* Anna Ray, of Lawrenceville. 111., was the lucky winner of an afghan; Mrs. James M. Keith, of Alton, 111., won a plant arrangement; and Myron Craig, of ^Ima, 111., won a year subscription to SKYLOOK. A flea market was an added attraction this year, and proceeds were turned over to the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis to assist in financing their many fine projects for educating the public re UFOe, Mrs. Mae Jannett and Mrs. Bill Christian were in charge of the flea market. UFO Group Meeting in Arkansas, September lot. 2nd and 3cd For some years Mildred and Ed Higgins have hosted an informal get together for UFO buffs at their home in September, and this year they are inviting anyone interested to their home at Starsong, Route 5, Fayetteville, Ark. on Sept. 1st, 2nd and 3rd. Mrs. Higgins, who is a MUFON representative says, \"We have room to sleep quite a few in our home. 1 * If that isn't real Southern hospitality, we don't know wh£t you'd call itI The best way to find their place is to go to Fayetteville and then phone the Higgins. Their number is 442-6615. After you leave Fayettevil3e, you go 9 miles east on Hwy 16 E. to Round Mountain,, When you reach Round Mountain, almost anyone can direct you to the Higgins home—but it might be best to telephone.
