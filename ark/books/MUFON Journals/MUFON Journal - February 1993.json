Frank Waiters (James Garner, n) confronts Mike Rogers (portrayed by Robert Patrick). Photo by Gregory Schwartz. I t is the night of November 5, 1975. A group of loggers are in a pickup truck on a mountain road in a northeastern Arizona forest when they observe a strange light in the sky. One of them, Travis Walton, leaves the vehicle to investigate and, later, his companions describe the events surrounding his disappearance. They report an occurrence they would have considered impossible if they hadn't expe- rienced it themselves—an encounter with a UFO. For five days the loggers are suspected of homicide until Walton reappears. His recollections of being aboard an alien craft bring international attention to their small town of Snowflake, Arizona. There are accusations of hoax but all must consider the possibility that the men are telling the truth. Is their account of what happened so incredible it can only be true? \"Fire in the Sky\" is a Joe Wizan/Todd Black Production based on the true story of Travis Walton, whose abduction by UFO is one of the best-documented cases. Starring D.B. Sweeney ('The Cutting Edge\"), Robert Patrick (\"Terminator II: Judgment Day\"), Craig Sheffer (\"A River Runs Through It\"), Peter Berg (\"Late for Dinner\"), and Academy Award nominee James Garner, the film was produced by Joe Wizan and Todd Black and directed by Robert Lieberman from a screenplay by Tracy Torme. Wolfgang Glattes is the exec- utive producer and Tracy Torme & Robert Strauss and Nilo Rodis-Jamero are the coproducers of the presentation of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Motion Picture Group of Paramount Pictures, part of the entertainment operations of Paramount Communications Inc. The film's special effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic. The cast of \"Fire in the Sky\" also includes Henry Thomas (\"E.T. The ExtraTerrestrial\"), Bradley Gregg ('The Fisher King\"), Noble Willingham (\"City Slickers\"), Kathleen Wilhoite (\"Lorenzo's Oil\"), and Georgia Emelin, who is making her motion picture debut. The biggest mysteries and greatest miracles in history have had few witnesses and those compelled to relate unprecedented experiences have inevitably faced contempt and ridicule. In 1975 an Arizona woodsman came forward to tell about a startling sequence of events. Seventeen years later, controversy still surrounds the incident. The subject of an autobiographical book, The Walton Experience, and many other publications concerning UFOs, the event is one of the best-documented claims of an alien encounter on record, corroborated by a group of witnesses whose stories have not changed. Walton's ordeal called into question his beliefs about the nature of life as he and the other loggers simultaneously faced the challenges posed by those who couldn't accept their account. \"At first I was angry at people.'s disbelief, even out- raged,\" remembers Walton. \"Back then, a lot of that had to do with the fact there were so many falsehoods being told. I've gotten more philosophical about the skepticism of peo- ple. It's not such an unnatural reaction. It's an incredible thing (that happened). What gets me upset is when people refuse to examine the facts or to even look at things.\" \"This is a story that speaks to human character and behavior—about our inclination to presume the worst in someone before considering ideas that challenge our own skepticism,\" comments producer Joe Wizan. Director Robert Lieberman says, \"Not only are we con- fronted with the enigma of truth or hoax, but the conse- quences faced by those who become ostracized from their community.\" S creenwriter Tracy Tonne identifies the film as a study of \"how a single event can alter your life forever just by (your) being unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'Fire in the Sky' is also about friendship and betrayal and forgiveness.\" Torme first heard of the Walton case while listening to the radio in high school. A decade later he travelled to Snowflake with co-producer Robert Strauss to investigate the story. \"I spoke extensively with Travis Walton and the other men who were involved, including Mike Rogers,\" says Torme, a Peabody award-winner and screenwriter of \"Intruders,\" a miniseries that also depicted UFO abduc- tion cases. \"Most of the guys had not seen each other in the past ten years. I questioned them individually and their answers always held up. Each man believed he was telling \"Walton does not appear to be a man liv- ing a lie. But at the same time there is no substantial proof of his encounter. It is an utterly fascinating, unanswered question.\" - Producer Joe Wizan the truth. I think they all had been traumatized by whatev- er happened that evening. It was a nightmare for them.\" Co-producer Robert Strauss adds, \"Travis went ten years without a telephone to avoid answering questions about that night. He installed one only a few days before Tracy Torme called. He must have considered that an omen, because he finally agreed to talk about everything.\" \"He was really intrigued by the idea of finally telling his story and trying to do it in some way that was more honest than the way some of the newspapers and the media por- trayed it,\" adds Torme. Comments executive producer Wolfgang Glattes, \"These men's story has never changed. As bizarre as their account is, it's equally difficult to believe it was a hoax.\" In the film, Travis Walton is portrayed by D.B. Sweeney, who views his character as fearless and perilous- ly curious when he leaves the pickup truck to get a better look at the strange light source in the forest. Sweeney says that he thinks \"Travis enjoyed the excitement of confronting danger\" and, at the beginning of his close encounter, \"His curiosity was not abated by fear.\" The circumstances surrounding Walton's disappear- ance seems impossible to the authorities, who fail to con- sider the fact that the loggers could have come up with a story that would have been easier to accept if they weren't determined to speak the truth. One man who wants to believe the loggers is Sheriff Blake Davis (Noble Willingham), who is nonetheless hardpressed to accept the loggers' unfathomable account. \"Blake doesn't know what the hell happened, but he knows some of these boys and trusts them,\" says Willingham. \"He has to call in Lt. Walters because he flat out knows he's in over his head.\" James Garner plays state investigator Lt. Frank Walters, a seasoned lawman who prides himself on knowing when a crime has been committed, insisting that he has been around too long to be taken in by a hoax. \"Frank Walters is reputed never lo have had an unsolved case,\" says Garner. \"In his words, 'It's a myth— but a damn fine one.' Called in to investigate the disappearance of Travis Walton he immediately concludes lhal Ihe boys are lying. There is jusl no way he can believe Iheir story. Every instinct tells him a crime has been commitled and he is determined to stick around until it's solved.\" Walters' lead suspect is the hard-nosed crew chief, Mike Rogers (Robert Palrick). Even ihough he was Walton's besl friend, Rogers finds himself under suspicion MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of having killed Walton because of Walton's desire to marry Rogers' 17-year-old sister. Comments Patrick, \"Mike Rogers is saying, 'Hey, you all know me. I grew up here ... I've lived here all my life. You're supposed to be my friends. How can you not believe me? I've never done anything wrong. Why won't you listen to me?' \" Patrick identifies the men as ordinary people in an extra- ordinary circumstance: \"Mike didn't ask for this to happen to him and certainly didn't benefit from it. He become lonely and isolated because the people he believed in didn't believe him. It tore apart his family and friendships.\" Craig Sheffer plays Allan Dallis, a restless and trouble- some member of Rogers' crew who refuses to be affected by events or the opinions of others. \"Dallis is a drifter who gets in trouble a lot and always has,\" comments Craig Sheffer. \"The last thing he wanted to do was bring public attention to himself. He knows that no one is going to believe him and the other guys.\" Dallis is reluctant to agree to Rogers' orders to \"stick to our story\" when the exhausted loggers arrive at a diner to report the incident to police. P eter Berg plays a soft-spoken and devoutly religious man, David Whitlock, who Berg describes as \"very introspective and (someone who) listens more than he speaks. When he does talk, his opinions are respected and given more credence than someone who talks constantly. David is deeply disturbed by guilt and confusion because what he witnesses that night challenges everything he believes in, everything his faith is built on.\" \"I'm skeptical of most things, but I am convinced of the validity of Travis Walton's story,\" Berg comments. \"I think it is utterly naive to think that reality is limited to only what we can see and hear.\" Sheriff Davis and Lt. Walters expect the youngest mem- ber of the crew, 16-year-old Greg Hayes (Henry Thomas), to be the first to crack under questioning. Says Thomas of his character, \"Greg is scared and somewhat ashamed. The police lean on him pretty hard because they think he wants to confess. And in a way, Greg and the other guys do feel guilty, because they let Mike go back alone to find out what happened to Travis.\" Speaking of his own character, Bobby Cogdill, Bradley Gregg relates that he is withdrawn and silent during Walters' intense questioning, too stunned to make sense of the ensu- ing events. \"The characters we play in this film are simple, hard-working, blue-collar guys,\" says Gregg. \"They lived in a small town and were not really aware of how much the police and the media would hound them once the word got out.\" In a scene set in a local Snowflake Mormon church, sheriff and townspeople discuss the variety of problems that Walton's disappearance has posed. Walton himself makes a cameo appearance as the attendee who asks \"Where's Travis?\" The scene was filmed during Walton's visit to the \"Fire in the Sky\" set for a few days with his wife, Dana, who is portrayed in the film by Georgia Emelin. Now a father of two boys and two girls aged seven through 14, Walton continues to live in Snowflake, leading a normal life but never entirely free from the notoriety brought to him by his experience. \"I ran away from this for years but could never escape it. No matter how much we try to avoid certain things in our life, they always seem to come back,\" says Walton. \"I final- ly chose to confront it. I'm not hiding anymore. An extra- ordinary thing happened to me but it hasn't changed my faith or my obligations or my character. I'm still like every- body else. I have a job and a family. I have to live my life.\" Did Walton undergo one of the most remarkable ordeals in human history? Or did he perpetrate a truly infamous hoax? Says producer Joe Wizan, 'Travis is an articulate and thoughtful man. He is devoutly religious and remains loyal to his church, despite the fact that many of its members rejected his claim. He does not appear to be a man living a lie. But at the same time there is no substantial proof of his encounter. It is an utterly fascinating, unanswered ques- tion.\" \"You have to wonder why Would someone want to make up a story like this and who would want to subject himself to the derision that would obviously come from making such a claim,\" says Lieberman. \"I think anyone witnessing something that incredible would dread having to explain it. Because that's when the ordeal begins ... when you have to get someone to believe you.\" When asked what he hopes the film will achieve, Travis Walton replies \"I hope it will allow people to put themselves where I was to the extent that they can be open-minded on the subject.. .the most I can expect in all fairness is for peo- ple to allow the possibility.\" Best of the Journal Votes for the favorite article published in the Journal during the 1992 calendar year are now in.

When I made that fateful choice to leave the truck, I was leaving behind more than just my six fellow workmen - I was leaving behind forever all semblance of a normal life and running headlong toward an experience so overwhelmingly mind- rending in its effects and so devastating in its aftermath that life would not - could not - ever be the same again. Nothing in this naive country boy's life up to that moment could've prepared me for what followed. But what I didn't know then, I think I know now. It's been a real education! And with the new book I try to share those insights. It's my hope that the release of Paramount Pictures' movie, \"Fire in the Sky,\" about my experience will help me to do that. When I wrote The Walton Experience (Berkley Books. 1978), the book that the movie is based upon, I stated my desire that the book would put the reader where we were when it happened. My hope was that if people could some- how experience it from my point of view, that perhaps they could take a more open and objective approach to their evaluation of it all. However, there is nothing that approaches the goal of allowing people to live someone else's experience nearly so well as does a movie. I think most people know better than to expect a documentary, but I have a feeling that \"Fire in the Sky\" is going to succeed in dropping the core essence of what I've been through right into the audience's lap. So hang on to your seats! I am rewriting The Walton Experience to be released under the same title as the movie, \"Fire in the Sky.\" Since the movie can do so much more to impart the vicarious experience of the events of November 5, 1975, the empha- sis of my expansion, revision and updating of the book, Fire in the Sky, will be on other areas. People need to know more about the prior lives of the people involved and the community in which it happened in order to understand the impact and the aftermath. And the 17 year aftermath is a story unto itself, a story so excruciating that my memories of what I have lived through because of some people's reaction to what happened was a hell that nearly overshad- ows the experience itself. One of the most neglected areas in the earlier book was the controversy surrounding the whole thing, the attacks by people who for various reasons felt compelled to try to deny that it had ever really happened. So many of these The author, with clunnsaw. as he appeared in 1975. attacks were so ridiculously baseless that 1 naively believed that a cursory rebuttal was sufficient. I thought that those inclined to doubt could easily be pointed in a direction that would lead to discovering that there was no truth in the alleged scenarios that had me or my co-workers halluci- nating on drugs, hoaxing, suddenly becoming psychotic, etc. I wrote as if all could be as easily refuted as the charge that the report was a cover story for a gory chainsaw murder. I could not have been more mistaken. It not only did not go away, it grew. Refuted claims were continuously resur- rected and, like a child's game of gossip, became embell- ished with each telling. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Therefore, I devote my greatest efforts in the new book, Fire in the Sky, to critical analysis of all the myriad attempts to explain away what was otherwise recognized as the most spectacular, best-documented such incident ever. You know, when I step back and take a look at all the attacks made on me in the media over the years, I am dis- turbed by the simple fact that some of this stuff was ever seen as fit to print. To be fair, I have encountered some excellent journalists, even some skeptical ones, who did their best to verify their facts and present an objective, bal- anced view. These seem to be the ones who actually do leave conclusions to the reader and not just pretend to. This is the ideal towards which I have come to feel I should strive. I used to be offended, even outraged, not just at false \"evidence,\" but at disbelief itself. I now realize that a certain degree of this disbelief is perfectly understandable because, after all, people are trying to judge a truly incred- ible report in what I frankly acknowledge is the absence of indisputable proof. Therefore, in reviewing these issues, I play the devil's advocate in places. Rather than say flatly \"this ain't so 'cause I was there and know how it really was,\" I tried to take'the difficult (for one in my place) neutral position that considers rather than dismisses negative \"evidence\" for purposes of discussion. I tried to present what is needed for an informed evaluation by an objective outsider. I entered this area of discussion with mixed feelings because here I am in the midst of finally having my own say about it all and I'm inadvertently providing an extended forum for a lot of crap that never should have been said in the first place. There is a post-Watergate mentality that seems to assume that public denials (or even allegations alone) are in themselves evidence of wrongdoing. This is a situation that leads many public figures to use the tactic of avoiding comment altogether. Not me. I'm no longer going to let this litany of innuendo, this tissue of lies and ad hoc assumption to dominate the floor unchallenged. Nonetheless, I drag this dreary stuff up with some hesi- tancy, even though I believe my rebuttals in most cases are totally devastating. O ne general rule about the media I've learned is that the retraction usually gets a smaller hearing than the original error, (if it gets heard at all). One prominent UFO \"debunker\" (I always put that word in quotes in this context because the guys I'm referring to are pretenders to that title and do not remove bunk, they make it) actually devotes one of his ten cardinal anti-UFO \"principles\" to stating that the news media are overwhelmingly biased in that they give great prominence to UFO reports when first received, but then virtually ignore prosaic explanations put forth after- wards. This \"debunker's\" criticism of the media is slanted by his skeptical bias. So much of the initial coverage of my experience was false evidence against the UFO incident, the subsequent disproof of which the media gave little or no To religious fanatics it was either Satan's minions in disguise or fiery chariots of the gods. To an atheist/humanist it was the quasi-religious UFO fanaticism of \"true believers.\" To astronomers it was a misiden- tified planet space or time to. If I were as biased as this \"debunker\", I could claim the opposite of what he does. However, my own view, which I think is the objective perspective, is that those in the media, for reasons often unconnected with any \"slant\", don't always give equal time to rebuttals, retractions or information contrary to an earlier story. Besides wondering how such baseless attacks could make it into print, I am further amazed at how things already disproven just kept on being recycled over the years. Not only was a lot of this stuff indisputably refuted long ago, it was incredibly absurd on the face of it right from the start. As I demonstrate, a moment's thought would have immediately removed a lot of this stuff from consid- eration. The credentials and credibility, methods and motives of my advocates were microscopically scrutinized while those of my detractors went unchallenged. I show that if even a fraction of the skepticism applied against me and my proponents had been applied to the nay-sayers, my life would have been a lot less miserable. There is a misconception so common that it warrants being ranked as a classic logical fallacy. This is the belief that if there are so many different attacks heard so many times from so many different sources, that there must be some validity to them. The truth, of course, is that a billion false- hoods told a billion times by a billion people are still false. What makes this reasoning especially illogical is when the various allegations starkly contradict each other. The most fundamental test of validity is the law of contradiction, i.e., a thing cannot be both \"A\" and \"not A.\" It is irrational to take a collection of theories that are mutually exclusive and act as if they add up and give weight to each other. Yet my foremost critics did exactly that. One man even said that it was a hoax and a drug hallucination in one breath! Logically speaking, not only does a collection of incom- patible accusations not have compounding strength, each cancels the others to the point where the collection has less merit than any one would have if made alone. T his is especially true when the disparate allegations are all put forth by a single individual. Why? Because it becomes apparent that the accuser is not being moved by the force of evidence for a specific theory but instead by some motive that precedes his flurry of tactics. Which brings up the question of just what is his real motive? So the irony is that when one's foremost detractor makes an internally inconsistent scattergun assault, he is actually MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"making a perverse sort of endorsement because it says loud and clear that the detractor himself doesn't believe that any one of his attacks has sufficient merit to stand alone. Especially revealing is when an attacker is forced to abandon previous positions as evidence prevails and invents a succession of new scenarios to shore up his \"conclusion.\" How can a so-called \"debunker\" maintain any claim to legitimacy when only his conclusion remains the same, but his justification for it is constantly shifting? One self-appointed \"debunker\" did this in regard to the UFO phenomenon in general, i.e., when his \"most UFOs are really plasmas\" bunk was ridiculed and debunked by plasma physicists, he dropped the plasma nonsense (his personal brand of \"swamp gas\") and went on to attack some of the same incidents with an entirely different set of charges. His campaign against me is following the same pat- tern. When his contrived edifice first started to crumble as I began refuting him, he was already showing signs of wavering and edging away from his prior claims. When I'm done, I predict he'll be forced to make a full retreat from the collapsing ruin of his previous \"convictions.\" And I predict that he'll come to act as if he never really said any of those things. After some vain attempts to defend the old non- sense, he'll espouse some new nonsense with the same fer- vent certainty. He rather refutes his own position and impugns his own motives. Like the Bard says, methinks he doth protest too much. The \"debunkers\" were not the source of all the criti- cisms and there were a lot of supportive and corroborative voices out there, too. But still we have this hail of dispar- agement against what on the other hand has been acclaimed by the top people in the field as the most proven, best doc- umented case of alien abduction in the history of scientific UFOlogy. So, what gives? What is it about this incident that drew so much fire? Could it have simply been a natural reaction to the bizarreness of the report? Perhaps in part. But I've seen my experience critically dissected in a magazine along- side a sympathetic, credulous report of bare claims of attacks by gigantic birds which offered no multiple wit- nesses, no polygraph tests, no physical evidence, virtually no documentation at all. D on't misunderstand. There were many people who never doubted the reality of the story and many news reports gave unbiased accounts. But on the other hand, absolutely every conceivable alternative explanation has been proclaimed at some point. Attempts to explain it all away had a predictable knee-jerk correlation to the nay-say- ers' own particular specialty. To lawmen it was a cover story for murder. To newsmen it was a publicity stunt. To a substance abuse worker it became a drug hallucination. To a geologist it became escaping underground gases or ball- lightning generated by plate tectonics. To religious fanatics it was either Satan's minions in disguise or fiery chariots of the gods. To an atheist/humanist it was the quasireligious UFO fanaticism of \"true believers.\" To astronomers it was a misidentified planet. To one psychiatrist it became child- hood mental trauma culminating in a \"transitory psychosis.\" And to some, especially UFO \"debunkers\", it was most of these simultaneously! As we shall see, these various theories are at complete odds with each other and, more important- ly, at complete odds, with basic, easily verified facts. It's almost as if people were saying \"anything but that! No matter how farfetched, ad hoc, or poorly fitting of the evidence - anything but that!\" I think I've figured out what made things turn so inex- plicably vicious and I discuss these factors in the book. Also, I now have a wealth of eye-opening evidence against my detractors and their nonsense. It's going to be a whole new ball game. After all that I've been through, I've lost my naive vulnerability and acquired a little savvy — with an important new difference — I can afford to fight back now. A certain few individuals who think they can heap calumny and character assassination on me without serious conse- quences are definitely in for some surprises. I harbor no ill will toward those who are merely doubt- ing, especially those who make a sincere attempt at an objective viewpoint. Disbelief is not my beef. Rational minds will sometimes disagree. I reserve my wrath for those who use false reasoning, sophistry, doctored data and outright falsehood in an attempt to dupe others into adopt- ing a disbelieving view. Of all the people and organizations that were excluded by Aerial Phenomena Research Organization from the early investigation of my case, I believe that MUFON was one of the most admirable in their success at cutting through the mis- information, the disinformation and the politicking that cloud- ed things back then. The fairness, objectivity and thorough- ness MUFON displayed helps explain why they are still around when groups like APRO, NICAP and GSW are not. As much attention as I give to the controversy issue, I would not want the most beneficial consequences of all this to be overlooked. The tremendous insight into human- ity I believe I've gained from my experience is but one of these. It's when we resolve the meaning of all this, the phenomena in general and my experience in particular, that I believe we will have finally acquired the paydirt, the ulti- mate point of it all.

The same avoidance seems evident in the realm of nationally televised news. We can all note the startling absence of coverage of the British Crop Circle revelations on all the major networks. In four years only a handful of documentaries have brought forth credible data on the mys- terious patterns occurring in fields worldwide. Most of us will not forget the day that the national media suddenly broke their eerie silence on this puzzling mystery to quick- ly and decisively denounce the phenomenon with the intro- duction of pub buddies Doug and Dave, who could explain it all by simply claiming they were responsible. It was as if the national media did not want to touch the story until it could be explained in an easy and earthly manner. However, unknown to 99% of the American public, the Doug and Dave story began disintegrating within 24 hours as British journalists, researchers, and scientists began digging deeper, uncovering many flaws and distortions in the process. But as the mystery returned, so did the media silence; there was no follow-up on the American news net- works. The American public was deliberately left to believe that the mystery was dead with the uninvestigated confes- sions of two English pub buddies. As scientific efforts began to produce a growing list of astounding discoveries in the labs and under the microscopes, the media seems to con- tinue to avoid the hard data that is now perpetuating the mystery rather than explaining it. Similarly, a local television station prepared a report last winter on the odd cattle mutilations that local ranchers were discovering during a brief but heavy wave of UFO sightings. The report concluded with a veterinarian's decla- ration that a disease was the obvious culprit — prior to any lab results or sample analysis! Later, the state's crime lab could not identify any known cause of death or support for the veterinarian's explanation. MUFON's investigative efforts properly placed samples in the competent hands of patholo- gist Dr. John Altshuler; he found precise incisions made by a form of highly focused energy or heat. When I approached the television station with this medical data, I was informed that they were not interested in any evidence which would perpetuate the mystery. \"No more UFO stories.\" What does any of this have to do with research on UFO abductions? Plenty. I have begun to notice that pro- fessional journals are beginning to publish \"explanations\" to their devoted subscribers prior to any proper presentation, description, or consideration of the credible cases, data pat- terns, or challenging scientific questions. It is human nature to desire to remain in control of our world in order to feel \"Science should be the investigation of the unexplained, not the explanation of the uninvestigated.\" safe and secure in a predictable environment. Does that increase the need to publish explanations for anomalous events before proper data collection and analyses? A recent letter to the editor of the Journal of Scientific Exploration (Vol. 6, No. 3, pp. 291-294, 1992) by James Wilson of Business Technology News Services proposes yet another explanation for many abduction cases: \"Recollections of Surgical Experiences.\" Wilson proposes that recollections of surgical procedures have created dis- turbing misperceptions that are interpreted as alien con- tacts. He suggests that this confusion is a result of the increase in outpatient surgeries which he describes as dis- orienting to the individual who does not get sufficient time to adjust to being in a hospital setting. He says these short- er stays, along with the effects of anesthesia, create distorted memories. An inpatient hospital stay has many \"rituals\" and memorable procedures whereas the outpatient process is devoid of these expected activities and \"customs.\" \"One minute the prospective outpatient is riding in his car on his way to the hospital. Minutes later he is flat on his back under the influence of a powerful tranquilizer that has left him conscious but unresponsive to the strange activities taking place around him. By the time he has fully recovered from the effects of the anesthesia he is in his car or home in bed. Fragments of memories of the operating room become merged with recollections of more mundane activities.\" W ilson unknowingly deals his own theory a serious set- back as he claims it is the combination of new surgi- cal procedures, fast-recovery anesthetics, and the dramatic increase in the number of outpatient surgeries — all of these factors occurring after 1980 — which supposedly account for the distortions that mislead people into thinking they were abducted. This would come as a great shock to Betty and Barney Hill, Charles Hickson, Travis Walton, Betty Andreasson, and others who reported experiences long before these advances of the 1980's. He also clearly fails to account for multiple witness cases. Even if the Hills had had mutual outpatient surg- eries in 1961, how would Wilson explain the simultaneous two-hour periods of \"confusion\" they experienced while rid- ing in their car? How could he account for any multiple abductee cases in which they report seeing each other aboard an alien craft doing specific things in a particular order and sequence that matches between their independent accounts? What about children and others who have never had surgery? Furthermore, he attempts to explain particular aspects of abduction reports in the following ways: MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ABDUCTION MEMORY Abductee recalls being levitated by a beam of light. EXPLANATORY SURGICAL EVENT Tranquilizers are administered to surgical outpatients before they are wheeled into the operating room. These drugs dilate the pupil, mak- ing lights appear brighter. The illu- sion becomes complete as the patient is lifted onto a brilliantly illuminated operating table. Surgical hoods create the appearance of an enlarged crania. Surgical masks compress the cheeks obscuring the nose and mouth. Surgical masks obscure lip move- ments. Two of the more common same-day surgeries are curettage and tubal lig- ation. Women patients awaiting admission often look at newboms in the hospital nursery. Surgeons place incisions in the navel to minimize visible scars. Outpatients are placed in the same recovery room. Many antibiotics increase a patient's sensitivity to the sun, producing a sore-like irritation. Federal law requires virtually every- thing in a modern operating room to be marked with graphic warning labels. Icon-like shapes identify com- bustible and oxidizing gases, toxic substances, etc. Although Wilson's efforts may seem amusing or even far-fetched to most researchers, I wish to commend him for being willing to construct a hypothesis for consideration. Sadly though, it seems he only has a superficial under- standing of abduction claims (I note that his four refer- ences do not include any studies of actual abduction data) and no apparent contact or interviewing of any abduction participants. Wilson is correct in proposing an analysis of abduction data to distinguish between abductees who have and have not had prior surgical experiences. But note that once again \"explanations\" find their way into publication and public notice rather quickly — before a careful analysis of actual data takes place. We shall keep pushing profes- sional journals toward acceptance of data-rich studies that Aliens have large eyes and atrophied noses and mouths. Aliens speak telepathi- cally.

Ufologists probably know the story j better as the Travis Walton case, from the 1978 Berkley paperback. The Walton Experience. Starring Robert Patrick, D. B. Sweeney and James Garner, \"Fire\" is directed by Ron Liebennan and pro- duced by Joe Wizan and Todd Black. Tracy Torme is the screenwriter. Torme's previous credits include the CBS mini-series \"Intruders,\" based on the Budd Hopkins book of the same name, and a stint as story editor for \"Star Trek: the New Generation.\" In co-operation with Paramount Pictures and Senior Publicist Gregg Brilliant, MUFON will par- ticipate in seven advance screenings of \"Fire in the Sky\" on Thursday evening, March 11. Premieres will be held at multiplex theaters in the New York City, Washington, D. C., Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas and Los Angeles areas. A MUFON panel will appear on stage after each screening to answer ques- tions from the assembled press media and audience. Participants will include various members of the MUFON Board of Directors, State Directors, Staff Specialists and State Section Directors. MUFON lit- erature will be available and each host organization will receive 75 free tickets for MUFON members, the latter to be distributed by the local MUFON team chairperson.

Strange flying objects continue to be seen by average persons and by airline and military pilots. The U.S. Government continues to stonewall. Hundreds of new cases of \"alien abductions\" were reported. But after almost a half century, UFOs are still the mystery of the age. UFO Sightings The approximate number of UFO sightings during 1992 is impossible to estimate, due to the refusal of most persons to report their sightings because of the fear of ridicule, and because most people have no idea how to report a sighting. There were, at the very least, hundreds of sightings in the U.S. and many more in other countries. But the numbers simply are not available. Of those that were reported to private agencies, most were \"low grade,\" meaning few of them contained much in the way of detail. With the great majority of sightings being at night, all that could be seen was lights that behaved oddly. This is not enough to enable analysts to determine the source in most cases. Government Activity The U.S. Government continues to insist it has had no interest in UFOs since it shut down the U.S. Air Force's \"Project Blue Book\" in 1969. At that time, it claimed that no sighting reported to it had shown any evidence of advanced technology, nor of alien origin, nor of posing a threat to national security. Off-the-record comments by current mil- itary persons strongly suggest that government interest and activity remain very high. Crashes and Retrievals While no new crashes of UFOs have been reported, the level of interest in old ones (New Mexico in 1947 and Pennsylvania in 1965) remains high. Additional witnesses to the New Mexico activity were found in 1992, and the search continues for bits of wreckage rumored to exist. The current official line is that nothing at all happened in July 1947 near Corona, New Mexico. \"Allen Abductions\" This is still the most bizarre aspect of the entire UFO sub- ject: the possibility that many innocent Americans have been taken against their will, subjected to peculiar medical procedures by odd beings, and then returned to their homes . or cars. The total number of such cases is now well over 1,000, with scores more reported in 1992. An extensive survey by the Roper Organization was released in July, and an analysis of it by some of the top \"abduction\" investigators and therapists suggests that as many as one percent of Americans may have experienced this phenomenon. The steady increase in interest among mental health professionals continued during the year, and a major con- ference was held for them at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in June. Among the projects currently receiving financial sup- port from the Fund for UFO Research are a continuation of the study of a large number of cases by Thomas Bullard, Ph.D.; the expansion of a referral service to assist victims; and the creation of a computer database for future studies. Crop Formations While there is still no solid link between the strange for- mations found in fields of grain (mainly in southwestern England) and UFOs, the possibility remains high enough to justify continued support of studies by the Fund. Hundreds more formations were found in 1992, including some of the largest and most complex ever. In early 1993, the Fund expects to publish the results of laboratory analyses of grain inside and outside many such formations. In England, a contest was held to create a com- plex formation, and the winner displayed surprising skill in creating some features previously thought to be difficult or impossible by hand. Journalism Award The Fund for UFO Research also sponsors an annual cash award, named in honor of the late Major Donald E. Keyhoe, for the best articles or stories published or broadcast during the previous year concerning the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. Three winners shared last year's $2000 cash prize. Final entries for 1992 are now due.

By Jeff Sainio Background details: The five photos analyzed were orig- inally taken by an individual (name known to MUFON) liv- ing in Lincolnshire, England, while visiting family in Ontario. Location: Near Belmont, Ontario, Canada. Time: May 5, 1992, approximately 2100 hrs. Witnesses: Photographer's parents and three family friends. Photos: Five photos taken before film ran out. First photo through a wet pane of glass. Last four from outside. Camera: Miranda A-X, autofocus, Kodak ASA100. Lens is a 34mm wide-angle. Photo 1: Shows a rural area with a gazebo with weather- vane on the right and a silo in the distance on the left. Low branches are on the horizon, with gray cloud cover except for some pink sunset at the right. There are a pair of white dots on the horizon on the right, possibly auto headlights or streetlamps. These could serve as a brightness standard if identified. They appear motion-blurred to the upper-left; if they are stationary lights, this would indicate the photo is motion-blurred, about 20% of the UFO height. A 3-millimeter-wide UFO is 8mm above the horizon (on a 150x 100mm print). It appears to be a white disk with a 1.25x.85mm cupola on top. The lower part of the cupola facing the camera is reddish. The UFO is about 50% brighter than the brightest sky in this photo, somewhat brighter than in the other photos. Several unfocused spots are presumably waterspots on the windowpane through which this photo was shot. The left side of the disk is slightly obscured by a branch, which appears as a vertical line in the enclosed montage; the contrast of the branch is over twice as much against the UFO as against the sky. This would be expected for a real object, but not for a waterspot, lens flare, film defect, dou- ble-exposure, reflection-on-glass, or nearby object. A near- by object would obscure the branch, while the other possi- bilities would have no effect on the absolute contrast, and would lower the relative contrast. This is confirmation of the witnesses' testimony of a distant object. Photo 2: The UFO has moved against a brighter part of the sky; the shape is similar to photo 1. Witness testimony gives a northeasterly direction to the UFO although this can't be verified by the photos. The blue color of the cupo- la, at its extreme in the reddest part, has over 25% less First photograph of a sequence of five. than the blue brightness of nearby sky. This would not occur in the case of a lens flare, double-exposure, or reflec- tion-on-glass, and shows that the UFO is a solid rather than transparent object. Film defects do not typically recur in successive photos, so again the witness testimony is cor- roborated Photo 3: The UFO is against bright sky, limiting the con- trast and therefore the visibility. The image is blurred some- what, possibly due to camera motion. Photo 4: This photo is underexposed, and there is clear, evi- dence of vertical camera motion which smears the weath- ervane image. The vertical post of the weather vane is clear, but the horizontal arm is poorly discernable. The UFO image is similarly smeared vertically, indicating the image was exposed simultaneously. This argues against a double-exposure, since separate exposures would not be expected to smear the same direction and amount. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Final photograph of sequence. Photo 5: The UFO image has shrunk to 2mm, presumably due to motion away from the camera. Other image sizes are unchanged, contradicting the notion that the lens magnifi- cation zoomed. The red of the cupola is less evident and is most prominent on the right, perhaps because the UFO has turned away. Despite the small size, it is the clearest of the photos. E dge-sharpness checking of the UFO versus a distant tree-branch verifies that both have similar focus, indi- cating that both are distant objects. Brightness-check of the sky around the UFO showed evidence for glare, about 30% further-out than the visible edge of the UFO. This would be expected from atmos- pheric dust, but can also occur from a dirty lens. The lack of glare would be suspicious, but its presence is not conclusive. Overall, this is a highly credible set of photographs, but of what? The clarity of the photos contraindicates that some earthly object is partially occluded, causing misidentifica- tion. The possibility of the UFO being, say, some cone of light from a spotlight on a helicopter, is eliminated because this cone of light would not block skylight like a solid object. Multiple photos and witness testimony eliminates various mechanical or film defects from consideration. (The majority of submitted photos involve witnesses who saw nothing unusual.) Fakery is doubtful, since homebrew methods could not create these photos in any way I can think of. Sophisticated equipment and expertise, or incredible luck, would be required. Such touches as the branch in photo 1 are most useful in this regard, since a faker who managed to repro- duce this feature might be expected to brag about it. Photogrammetry, using the formula of object size equals print size divided by print magnification times distance divided by focal length (in this case 50mm) yields a theo- retical size of 24 meters per kilometer; wildly guessing that the UFO was 2 kilometers away, the UFO was then 24 times 2, or 48 meters (about 155 feet) across. T he UFO position between shots is roughly 22, 24, 30, and 33 mm. The witness stated that the photos were taken as soon as the camera cycled, except in running out- side after the first shot. (This changes the arrangement of the background, so the first number's usefulness is doubtful.) I could not identify this camera; perhaps it is only pop- ular in the UK. I will assume it is an autowind, and that the limiting factor was flash recharging. (The last photo shows evidence of flash, but it could be house lighting: I'm not cer- tain flash was even used.) Flash is useless for distant shots, but probably had the useful side effect of limiting the cam- era exposure. Otherwise the camera would probably have overexposed the UFO, which was reported as quite bright by the witnesses. If the typical scenario occurred where the flash recharge slowed, due to repeated firing straining the batteries, the lengthening of distances between exposures makes perfect sense, assuming a smoothly-traveling UFO. The UFO moved about 10 times its own diameter between shots. Assuming 5 seconds between shots and a 2- kilometer distance, this is 280 meters in 5 seconds or about 3 kilometers per minute, or 200 kilometers per hour. Note this figure is based on several wild assumptions and should only be used as a framework for more accurate calculations based on further witness testimony. If the camera cycling is slower, the UFO speed is slower. If the UFO distance is fur- ther, the UFO speed is faster. Ontario was quite rife with UFO reports at this time, notes MUFON's Provincial Section Director Tom Theofanous. Many of the sightings have been traced to a small, internally-illuminated blimp employed in a McDonald's pizza-promotion campaign over southern Ontario. (Yes, pizza!) The blimp carries only a single pilot and is described as much smaller than the typical Goodyear blimp seen in this country. \"I'm 99 percent certain the object photographed is the McDonald's blimp,\" says Theofanous. \"It was in the right location at the right time.\" Mr. Sainio is manager of Imaging Research and Development at the Quad/Tech Division of Quad/Graphics.

All times are local. • Log #920903: On July 4, 1992 about 9:30 PM a 32- year-old self-employed man and his brother photographed nine red lights that appeared to be on a triangular-shaped object off route 302 near Pinebush, NY; investigator, Dana M. Schmidt. The object made a hissing sound. The witnesses had a new Cannon Elon camera, 100-300 mm zoom lens with 1600 speed Kodacolor print film; they were looking for UFOs at a local \"hotbed of UFO activi- ty.\" Shutter speed was automatic, and estimated at 1/15 second. Four photos were taken, and the best three were analyzed using a PCD Film Scanner Model 2000 and put on a photo Compact Disk using a Model 2400 Work Station. The three largest lights were mostly white on the film, apparently caused by overexposure. The tops of the lights appeared flattened on the most distant photo, indi- cating possible shielding from structure. The witness reported having a vision of Jesus in 1982 and seeing a UFO while with his girlfriend on another occasion. Hypnosis is being considered. Nothing could be seen in the photos suggesting they are faked. • Log#930101E: On April 4. 1992 at 11:10 PM a 29-year- old nurse's assistant was on her way home in East Providence, RI when a triangular-shaped UFO approached and hovered 30 feet above a tee intersection and the grassy shoulder ahead of her: investigators, Vincent Esposito, Sandy Lapore, and Daved Rubien. She stopped. The craft was about 30 feet on each side and was below the tops of the 40-foot trees beyond. It emitted a distinct low-frequen- cy hum. She felt she was being watched. The craft appeared to be dark metal with \"lines\" or \"seams\" on the bottom at distinctly staggered positions, and there was a light on each corner; one white, one green and one blue. There appeared to be a small dome on the top front. She slowly drove under it. and she saw the craft leave as she hurried home. She felt that the craft moved to that position and waited for her. During a later rain storm, the investigators noticed a \"dry\" area where the craft had hovered. Soil samples are being analyzed. Also, on July 30, 1992 the road surface there was torn up to replace an electrically-operated water pump. Reports of intermittent water pressure in that area started in mid June. A friend of the witness also reported seeing the same craft at a different time and place. The witness may have had long-term involvement, because her mother saw several craft over her home in April 1991. She also said the witness was \"missing\" for several hours at a time, at age five, with no explanation as to where she was. • Log #930102E: On April 18. 1992 at 11:05 PM a 29- year-old nurse's assistant (same as case #93010IE) saw the same 31'x3l'x3r gray triangular craft she encountered two weeks earlier; investigators, Vincent Esposito. Sandy Lapore and Daved Rubien. She was driving west at Cushman and Pawtucket Avenue in East Providence. RI when the craft, several times, displayed knowledge of exact- ly where the witness was heading. She had the distinct feeling she was being watched. She stopped as the craft hov- ered 50 to 75 feet from her. She turned around to see if it would follow her, and it paced her on Pawtucket Avenue. She turned around again, and the craft crossed the road several times directly in front of her. When she slowed, it slowed. The craft displayed brilliant white, blue, and green lights, slightly pulsating! The craft passed under the 100.000 volt power line crossing Pawtucket near the Dunkin Donuts. She started feeling panicky and increased speed to well over the limit when the craft flew to the area of her April 4. 1992 sighting four miles away. The craft was never more than 5 or 10 feet above any building or tree during its flight. The witness felt it was showing her that it knew who she was and where she was going. • Log #930103E: On June 1. 1992 at about 8 PM five retired folks driving from Milton to Lewes, DE saw three bright white lights in a triangular formation: investigator. Kevin Reynolds. They were apparently stationary at an elevation of about 45°. After about 20 seconds the lights \"went out,\" one at a time. • Log#930104E: In the summer of 1980 at about 6:10 PM a mother and her two daughters saw strange reddish lights from Gaylord's parking lot in Elsmere, DE; investigator, Raymond Gurczenski. They watched it for about five min- utes before driving home. The UFO followed them. When they got out of the car in the driveway, they were amazed to find a disk, with a silver convex bottom and red and orange flashing lights on a flatter rim, hovering directly over their house. The lights or rim seemed to be rotating. It was just above the treetops. The object shot up the street about a block and then repositioned itself directly over the house. They ran in to get the husband, and when they came back out it was gone. • Log #930105E: On September 10. 1992 about 4 AM a 36-year-old landscaper and a 25-year-old publisher's research assistant saw what appeared to be two triangles MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"connected by a cylinder heading NNE over Fenwick Island, DE; investigators, Steven Rosiak, Hugh Horning and Elaine Douglass. The leading triangle was smaller than the trailing one, and they seemed to be illuminated by the moon. Ten to 12 starlike white lights seemed to be attracted to the object and flew out of sight with it. One witness reported some of the points of light were connected by more faint bars of light. The object was in sight less than a minute, and a roaring sound was heard briefly as it went out of sight. About 15 minutes later a second unknown object was seen following the same path. • Log #930106E: On September 30, 1992 at 9:15 PM a 38- year-old mechanic saw a bright, yellowish cone-shaped light surrounded by four misty-white cigar-shaped lights near Stanley, NC: investigator, George Fawcett. The lights, thought to be quite large, were observed for about three minutes heading northwest. This was within five minutes and five miles of an independent UFO sighting described differently, Log #921202E. The following case summarizes were received from George A. Coyne, Central Regional Director. • Log #061092C: November 1990, Rosdale, OK near Hwy 59 South. Investigated by Ginna Meyer of Norman, OK. The firearm deer season had opened and a 14-year-old boy entered a wheat field to sit under a tree. He was seated so that he was looking west but could watch to the south and north of his position. He was looking south when he noticed a bright white light moving north toward him at a very low altitude. The light appeared to be about a mile away. He thought that it might be an airplane that was going to crash but it sustained a level flight. He then thought it could be an ultra-light plane but knew it was unlawful to fly them dur- ing hours of darkness. The sun had not risen so it was still dark. The light continued to fly in a northerly direction, get- ting closer to him. When it was 100 yards directly west of him, he lifted his rifle up to his shoulder so he could get the object in his scope. He realized that there was no sound associated with the object. He thought about \"squeezing the trigger to let off a shot at it,\" but reconsidered; \"no, if it is an alien craft from another planet that wouldn't be a very friendly hello.\" Then, \"If it's a top secret Air Force plane, I don't want to kill anybody flying it, whether human or other.\" He continued to watch the disc-shaped object in his scope. He estimated it to be 30-40 feet in diameter, 7 feet high, with white lights along the sides and it appeared to be spinning. A blue-green light coming from the bottom of the object lit up the wheat field. The object continued to fly north at a steady altitude of 40-60 feet, at 20-30 miles an hour. He kept watching until it was a blur in the north. • Log #080392C: Feb. 2, 1992, Union Grove, WI, 10:47 p.m. : investigator Mark Giese. A man was driving west on A man driving west on Highway 11, near Union Grove, Wisconsin, had his car engine stalled by a large UFO three football fields in length. It made a \"weird, windy, whistling noise, like a high-pitched musical note.\" The object then glowed brighter and his car restarted. Hwy 11, heading to Union Grove to pick up his sister. A very large UFO, about \"three football fields\" in length, approached his car from the front side as he drove. It glowed brighter and his car's engine went dead. He coasted to a stop and put the car in park. He got out of the car and watched the object for about 3 minutes. He felt that he could not look away from it. It made a \"weird, windy, whistling noise, like a high pitched musical note.\" The object then glowed brighter and his car restarted. He felt that had he not put the car in \"park,\" it might have rolled off when it restarted. He drove on to Union Lake to pick up his sister. She asked why he was late. He estimated he was about 20 minutes late. Subsequent to the sighting the wit- ness discovered a rash on his arm (triangle shape) and 3 scars. • Log #072092C: February 6, 1992, Calumet, OK, near Hwy US 270; investigator Chuck Pine, Tuttle, OK. On the morning of February 6, near Calumet, OK, a farmer and his son found a young steer lying dead in a pasture. The wounds were dry and bloodless. His son was so amazed by what had happened to the steer that he took his girlfriend to see the animal that same evening. As they neared the pas- ture, both saw a large, round white glowing object above the pasture. When they got closer, they could see red, blue, green, yellow, and white lights flashing around the rim of the object. The girlfriend was frightened so they went back to his home and then to her aunt's house. He returned home after which he and his father went back to the pasture in the truck. The large white object was gone but they both saw a moving \"star\" that stopped. They drove two miles beyond the pasture before turning the truck around and heading back. The \"star\" sped off to the SE. Two days later they found the second mutilated steer just like the first one in the same pasture. The second steer had a triangular cut on the scrotum and a 2' x 2' pool of bright red blood at the rectal end. What does this pool of blood indicate? Was it an inter- rupted mutilation...did someone get careless or what? Samples of the tissue from the mutilated steers were sent to Dr. John Altshuler in Denver, CO but there was no evidence of heat being used to make the cuts. • Log #050492C: Feb. 25, 1992, Bath County, East Fork, KY; investigator Anne MacFie.

The helper spotted something that looked \"Well, it looked like a flying saucer.\" It was moving through the air, coming in from the northeast about 100 ft. above the ground. He pointed it out to the farmer, who made a joke about it. They watched the small object move toward a stand of trees in the hollow. It land- ed in the trees, then turned on its side or unfolded or some- thing, until it looked like a very bright aluminum circle that was flashing the brightest blue, green, and yellow lights. They drove on over the hill to feed the cattle. After the cattle were taken care of, they went back to find out just what the strange object was. The farmer got out of the truck and headed for the hollow. The helper also got out of the truck but got right back in. Nothing was found at the landing site, not even a broken tree limb. The object was first sighted as a dull gray, slow flying object with a dark stripe or edge through the center of the walnut shape. There were two black spots or holes on the underside of the object. • Log #101992C: First sighting occurred August 11, 1992 at 5:10 a.m. at Forest Lake, Minnesota. The second sighting took place on August 19, 1992 at 5:45 a.m., at New Scandia. Both sightings were investigated by Robert E. Engberg, RE. On August 11, a 55-year-old man was delivering news- papers going east on North Shore Trail, which runs beside the lake. He was driving a \"mail Jeep\" that has the steering column on the right side. He was looking out the right win- dow when he noticed a glow on the water. Looking up he saw an object moving from his right to left. The early morning sky was clear as the object moved from NW to SE. The man could see the object glowing white on the front and trailing a bright blue flame from the back. It was mov- ing very rapidly at an estimated speed of 800 to 1000 miles per hour, at an altitude of 3000 to 5000 ft. He lost sight of it as it descended behind some trees. At 5:45 a.m. on August 19, 1992, the witness was dri- ving north on Joliet Ave. near 223rd Street in New Scandia, when he saw the object again. This time, the object passed in front of him. It was glowing white on the nose and trailed the bright blue flame. After the \"flame-out,\" the witness could make out a long \"squarish\" shape that had four windows along its side. He estimated that the object was 200 ft. long and much bigger than a 747 jetliner. He stopped the Jeep, jumped out and yelled to a man that was walking nearby, \"Did you see that?\" The man said that he had not. He was walking in the opposite direction so that the object was at his back. On both occasions the witness saw the object as glowing white on the front, with a bright blue flame. When the flames were present the object appeared to be about 500 feet in length. When the flames died out it appeared to be about 200 feet in length. It was always moving at a high rate of speed and descended behind some trees. On both occasions his first thought was that it was a meteor or some type of space junk. As a side note: A female newspaper route carrier who was north of the witness observed a very bright light going over the lake about the same time as the witness had his sighting on August 11, 1992. • Log #1205920: September 16,1992, 12:30 a.m. near the city of Elk River, MN. Investigators, Gary Thrash and Bill McNeff. Mr. \"T\" was driving east toward County Road 70, which is NE of Elk River. A thunder storm was in full- swing with lightning flashes all around. As the lightning flashed he could see a huge white disc formation against the dark clouds. Each time the lightning flashed the disc would \"stick out like a sore thumb.\" The man turned north on County Road 70 and when he had driven about two and one half miles he came to a bend in the road. As he rounded the bend he got the surprise of his life. \"There hanging over a semi-open area in the woods was a huge UFO. It was about the size of a large passenger jet.\" He could see that the object was disc shaped with a dark color outline. No win- dows were noted but the perimeter of the bottom edge of the craft was fully lit. There were four round white lights spaced evenly around the outside of the bottom. Between each white light, smaller green and red lights, were spaced so that there were white-green-red-green-white lights. All lights were steady and unblinking. Mr. \"T\" said the craft was beautiful to look at as it hovered silently. 'The rain was coming down and the wind was blowing at a good clip. It struck me odd that the rain seemed to stop about a foot above the craft.\" He drove very slowly as he watched the object as it hovered 100 feet from the ground, 200 feet from the road. He watched the object for more than a minute and a half. The following current cases have been summarized by Indiana State Director Francis Ridge or Deputy Director of Investigations Ron Johnson. Unless noted, no sound, odor or vibration was detected. All times are local. • Log #921203J: A male of unknown age was in his bed- room, early morning in July 1988, when he noticed a \"blink- ing\" light on his bedroom wall: investigator Norma Croda. At first he thought the lights may have been coming from a police or fire vehicle. He looked out his bedroom window to see five objects 1.5 to 2 feet in diameter \"floating\" approx- imately 5 to 6 feet away from the window and about 6 to 7 feet off the ground. Somewhat frightened, he watched the objects change from white disks to \"big bubbles\" with pulsing blue lights coming from within the objects. The objects then changed color to orange and back to disc shapes with a \"flash.\" They then \"shot up\" and took off at a high rate of speed. This occurred at Plainfield, Indiana.

O. Learner and Francis Ridge. It appeared lower than tree-top level and was coming down an alley, heading south, making a loud grinding noise, \"maybe a roaring would better describe it.\" It was evening and there were plenty of lights in the area, a filling station, etc., so the object was very bright. \"Then I recall seeing a cigar-shaped object with round, window-looking things. Through the windows I could see heads on necks. They looked like the silhouettes people used to cut out. I don't recall any features,or any hair ... just that they were people-like heads on thin necks.\" The interior was flame colored. In an instant the object was gone. There was 1.5 to 2 hours of missing time. (Note: same year as abduction of Antonio Villas-Boas in Brazil.) • Log #921209J: A 52-year-old female was driving her car west on U.S. 40 between the towns of Plainfield and Belleville, Indiana on March 3, 1992 at 8:10 p.m.: investi- gator Norma Croda. The witness saw a large triangle-shaped white light, with a small square red light attached at the bot- tom, and a green glow around the base, off in a cornfield, hovering at 50 feet altitude and perhaps 500 feet away. The object was as large as a full moon and as bright as the sun. The witness stated she was unable to hear the air-con- ditioner in the car or traffic passing her as she pulled over to watch. The light hovered in the southwest then moved to the east and disappeared: \"poof, it was gone!\" The witness stated the light laid down horizontally and gave off green sparks when it moved. The witness was concerned that other cars had passed by without seeming to notice the bright object. • Log #921207J: A 29-year-old delivery truck driver and father of two told law enforcement authorities that an alien spaceship came to his backyard in Centerville, Indiana the night of 8 June 1991: investigator Don Worley. He said he was transported instantly in a bright light on board the 30 foot long, 10-foot high, roughly triangular craft into a tri- angular room with two, very tall (nearly 7 feet) aliens hav- ing flat features and slanted eyes. When one of the aliens, who never spoke but seemed to transfer calming telepathic thoughts, put out its hand, the abductee gave it a $20 bill from his pocket, which the alien kept (!). They applied a pen-sized black object to his right arm which left three 4- inch marks still visible weeks later, and applied a small, sil- ver box near the abductee's right temple causing him to lose consciousness. He awoke in his home, in his bed some 13 hours later with an itching arm, a painful shoulder, and \"reeling\" as if recovering from drunkenness. He also had a bloody nose. In the yard where he stood watching the flying object come near, and from where he was enveloped by its beam of light, two 16-inch circular patches of dead, brown grass had appeared nine feet apart. Samples of the grass and soil were collected. • Log #921204J: On 11 October 1990, a 28-year-old woman was driving with an unnamed family member along rural roads near Monterey, Indiana at about 9:00 p.m. when they sighted \"a white ball UFO\": investigator K. O. Learner. \"As we proceeded slowly toward the east more white balls were over the treeline to the north. We stopped the car ... I got out with binoculars...wanted a closer look.\" Over the next ten minutes the witnesses counted five or six \"white balls,\" several red ones, and three \"lighted triangles\" mov- ing at various speeds \"very close and very low ... almost overhead.\" The triangle-shaped objects were described with white lights at each point and along the borders, and indi- vidual red, green and blue points of light covering the underside. These lights were steady-burning, but a \"faint, white light blinking only every so often\" was seen off the lead point of the triangle through the binoculars. The red and white balls proceeded in a line formation, five abreast, and all objects eventually moved out of sight to the west. \"Wished I would have had my camera,\" said the main wit- ness,\" a veteran of several such sightings in the area.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON FORUM Letters to me journal FIRE IN THE SKY Dear MUFON Members: Thank you for participating in the release of \"Fire in the Sky.\" The purpose of this letter is to inform those involved about some of the fictional aspects of our film, and the reasons for them. For the most part, \"Fire in the Sky\" remains truthful to the Walton incident in fact and spirit. However, it was nec- essary to use some artistic license in a few areas. To begin with, there are six woodsmen instead of seven — three taken directly from real individuals, while the other three are composites. Some of the law enforcement officials are also composite characters. \"Fire\" was in the early stages of pre-production when the CBS mini-series \"Intruders\" first aired. Paramount was alarmed at the similarities between classic abduction expe- riences and the beings Travis reported seeing. They insist- ed that we fictionalize the alien sequences — something I wouldn't entirely agree to — so a compromise was reached which maintains the thrust of Travis' abduction but also includes some new angles inspired by other, more unusual abduction cases. It should also be noted that the director created a couple of UFO experts at the last moment who were meant to add a \"David Lynch\" quality to the film. These characters are not in any way meant to represent any specific individuals or organizations in the UFO movement. —Tracy Torme Cheyenne 7 Productions Los Angeles, CA CROP CIRCLES REVISITED The reaction of MUFON Journal readers to James Schnabel's extraordinary piece in the November issue will surely be: \"What on earth was all that about?\" And they will probably also ask: \"Who is James Schnabel?\" and \"Who are A, B, C, D... X, Y and Z?\" They might also wonder how he gets to write five pages in the MUFON Journal at the drop of a hat! Perhaps I can cast some light on these mysteries. If indeed Schnabel is a \"spy\" (his description, not mine!) he really has a lot to learn and should probably go straight back to graduate school in Langley, Va. Rule Number 1 is that you shouldn't talk to strange men on the telephone and certainly not ones with odd-sounding foreign names! Having made this slip, Schnabel then seems to have gone to quite incredible lengths to persuade everyone that what he said in this taped conversation was untrue: \"it was just a send up; a piece of light-hearted fun\" But seriously, if this was a \"send up\", why such frenzied efforts by Schnabel and his associate Irving to deny the tape's authenticity and suppress a commentary and tran- script of it which were to have appeared in \"The Circular\"? All other hoaxes, even circular ones, are always left for the victims to accept and then make fools of themselves. This \"hoax\" is called back in and strenuously denied! Double bluff? Well, if you believe that one, you'd believe anything! One should of course listen to the actual tape, rather than read the transcript, to appreciate the ring of truth in what is said. Initial voice stress analysis of the tape certainly indicates Schnabel is not lying. \"What taped conversation?\" asks the puzzled reader of the Journal. \"Where has a transcript of this been pub- lished and what does it contain?\" The answer to this is that nothing had been published at the time Schnabel's denials appeared in the Journal. It will, of course, be published — if that is allowed — but, so far it has been censored: it was physically removed from 1700 copies of an already printed magazine, \"The Circular\" (which I happen to edit), during my absence in the U.S.A. There really must be something which Mr. Schnabel wants to hide then... Almost none of Schnabel's first telephone conversation with Victorian is reproduced in the MUFON Journal article; only snippets from a later conversation and from a different tape produced by Irving. Most of what is said by Schnabel on the original tape is unsurprising since it concerns things which are hardly disputed. These include the fact that \"a number of agencies throughout the world have taken an interest in this (the crop circle phenomenon).\" We know of the British Government's interest, despite denials of the many occasions where the military have been involved in surveillance and photography of the circles and from a report we have of an unpublicised ministerial meet- ing in London in September 199O. At this meeting, during which it was acknowledged that the cause of the circles was completely unknown, there was talk of \"disinformation\" as a possible counter measure. The interest of the U.S. government was first made apparent to me when I was asked out to lunch to meet four gentlemen from the CIA in Arlington, Va., in April 1992, shortly before I was due to present on the crop circles at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Was their interest just a casual whim? I hardly think so. Two other per- sons who attended this lunch appointment with me and the CIA are also mentioned on the tape. A written application under FOIA for information from CIA files on crop circles had earlier been met with the reply \"...we have determined that the information regarding crop circles that you seek from Agency files would not contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the United States Government.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"More recently I have presented to the US Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Md., on the English circles and pictograms —which Schnabel seems so anxious to tell us are no more than man-made hoaxes. Schnabel expresses the view (on the tape) that the cir- cles are something \"very sinister\", and \"bringing about changes in world consciousness...for evil.\" Now, why should he deny this perception, which corresponds closely with what he has been known to opine in private? It also corresponds to an officially expressed, view of some reli- gious denominations, including the Catholic church, that things such as the circles, UFOs and abductions are the \"works of the Devil.\" If this is what he believes, as a Catholic, why is he ashamed to admit it? Then there is a ref- erence to \"spiritual warfare.\" a viewpoint frequently expressed in connection with the UFO topic in the U.S. Well maybe it is not just his disclosure that the U.S., the British and the German governments are involved in a campaign to disparage the circles phenomenon that is so embarrassing to him, but the fact that he, Schnabel, says on the tape that he is taking \"active measures.\" One must say that many knew about this too, although there is barely a whisper of it in Schnabel's article in the Journal. During the summer of 1992, he and Irving, togeth- er with a number of other people whose names I have, faked a series of at least 15 crop formations, principally with a view to fooling and discrediting researchers from the Centre for Crop Circle Studies. Now this might appear no more than a piece of mischief, but rest assured that it was a great deal more insidious than that. These operations were carried out like a military operation and many of these fakes were produced with expert attention to detail. This was not just good-humored circlefaking. Much of it seemed specifically aimed at disrupting and confusing the results of the scientific testing of crop circle by CCCS's Project Argus, which was being carried out in the vicinity of Alton Barnes. Indeed, Robert Irving referred more than once to \"this ridiculous so-called scientific exercise.\" Listen to this taped conversation and one gets a very clear indica- tion of Schnabel's motives; \"active measures\" seems to sum up precisely what he has been engaged in, and his antipathy towards the crop circle phenomenon and CCCS. Schnabel has already admitted to his circlefaking on a British TV program. However, direct evidence of his involvement has appeared more recently on one of two well-edited tapes produced by Irving in desperate but uncon- vincing attempts to prove that Schnabel knew he was talk- ing to Victorian on the original tape. Irving inadvertently left on the reverse side of one tape a further recorded telephone conversation describing his and Schnabel's faking of a par- ticular crop formation at Alton Barnes. This may be used in evidence when charges of criminal damage are brought by farmers against them (though doubtless we shall be told that this tape is just another \"send up\"). So what's a clean-cut American from the environs of Washington, D.C., sometimes describing himself as a Ph.D. student at Bath University and sometimes as a freelance journalist, doing carrying on a crusade against the circles phenomenon in England? Despite all his huffing and puff- ing in the MUFON Journal, and his farrago of extraordinary claims and embellishments regarding what other people are supposed to think or to have said, there are still many questions that should be asked about Mr. Schnabel and his activities over here. No one has actually said that he belongs to CIA, XYZ, or any other organization, but his curious behaviour might well make one think so. Since he and Mr. Irving have offered us little but hoax and deception in 1992, it is hard to see his denials and disclaimers in the Journal article as being different from what he has given us already. — George Wingfield Editor, The Circular Somerset, UK SCHNABEL'S RESPONSE George Wingfield's letter is an occasion for sadness. I fond- ly recall my first meeting with Wingfield in the summer of 1991, when I was writing an article on the circles for a British magazine and he was holding court with the Beckhampton Group at the Waggon and Horses pub in Wiltshire. He allowed me to place my tape recorder beside his pint glass for most of an evening, and although I did not agree with all of his views, I was impressed by his eloquent, witty, and entertaining storytelling style — which only got better with every refill of that pint glass. Now for him the laughs are over and spies and wreckers are everywhere. Even his own colleagues within the Centre for Crop Circle Studies have come under suspicion for their role in re-edit- ing the CCCS magazine issue which was to have detailed The Plan. But let me respond directly to some of his charges. Firstly, Wingfield states that I am a Catholic and insinuates that I consider crop circles and other strange phenomena to be \"the works of the devil.\" Despite my repeated denials of this and his utter lack of evidence to the contrary, he has been levelling this charge at me for the past year; indeed, as I wrote in my article, Wingfield's claim that I am an anti- paranormal zealot formed the basis for much of the so- called Plan — in the same way that his own expectations concerning crop circle evolution regularly form the basis for the designs that actually appear in the fields. Wingfield's insensitivity to evidence which contradicts his beliefs is so great that I sometimes wonder if he has sim- ply become cynical about the whole thing. When I tele- phoned him to tell him that Irving's and my taped conver- sations with Victorian had been a hoax, I said that to assure himself that this was the case, he need only listen to MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Victorian's taping of his first conversation with Irving, in which it is abundantly clear that Irving is having a laugh at Victorian's expense. Should that tape fail to appear from his source, I added, his suspicions should be aroused. It didn't, and yet Wingfield continued full speed with his conspiracy- mongering. Wingfield also makes certain allegations about my cereological artistry. I don't deny having acquired a modest talent in this area, but I am annoyed that Wingfield (who ignores the activities of circlemakers who promote his own cereological views) would pretend to have any inside knowledge of it. At one point he implies that he has solid evidence that I and my fellow covert operatives have pro- duced \"at least 15 crop formations,\" at another he mentions \"direct evidence\" via yet another tape-recorded conversa- tion. In fact, Wingfield has no evidence of any circlemaking activities on my part, other than my brief and vague com- ments on a British TV documentary, and my participation in the Cerealogist's circlemaking competition. The tape to which he refers does not include a description of anyone's circlemaking activities, at Alton Barnes or anywhere else; one has only to listen to the tape to know that Wingfield's allegations are disingenuous. Wingfield says he has subjected the tape of my con- versation with Victorian to \"voice stress analysis,\" initial results from which (what about final results?) indicated that I was not lying about The Plan. Leaving aside the fact that voice-stress analysis is generally considered to be unre- liable (especially when unequivocably \"true\" and \"false\" voiceprints, on the same tape, are not available for com- parisons), let us suppose that under the appropriate condi- tions, I am allowed to speak some uncomplimentary remarks about Wingfield into his stress analysis machine. Will Wingfield agree in advance to abide by the results? Finally, Wingfield implies that the CIA showed its hand by taking him to lunch. I can only be agnostic on the question of current government interest in crop circles or UFOs, but I understand that this mysterious lunch invitation arose when a group of circles enthusiasts who happen to also be CIA employees, and whose affiliations with the Agency are overt and far-removed from any field opera- tions, wished to extend some hospitality to Wingfield dur- ing his visit to Washington. Had they truly been part of any anti-cereological conspiracy, they would have known Wingfield better, and would have realized what wild rumors their welcoming gesture would allow him to set loose. — Jim Schnabel Oxford, England Schnabel's original article, \"Confessions of a Crop Circle Spy, \" appeared in the November 1992 Journal.Responses by Armen Victorian and Graham Birdsall, editor of Quest International's UFO Magazine (UK) followed in the January 1993 issue. George Wingfield is a well-known English cereologist who frequently tours this.country lec- turing on the subject. As we go to press, he may or may not be the acting editor o/The Circular, the in-house Journal of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, having once resigned out of protest over the alleged suppression of the Victorian- Schnabel tape. Schnabel is an American living in England. — Editor CIA MISSION Jean Sider errs in his article in the Dec. 1992 issue when he writes that the National Security Council issued a directive saying that \"The Director of Central Intelligence shall for- mulate and carry out a program of intelligence and research activities required to solve the problem of instant positive identification of unidentified flying objects.\" What Sider quotes is a draft version, prepared by H. Marshall Chadwell, Asst. Director for Scientific Intelligence and submitted to Director of Central Intelligence Walter B. Smith with Chadwell's memorandum of Dec. 2, 1952. Two days later, Dec. 4, the Intelligence Advisory Committee—with top intelligence experts from the CIA, Air Force, Navy, Army, FBI and other government agencies met. One of the items discussed was UFOs. The committee endorsed the CIA's proposal to \"enlist the services of select- ed scientists to review and appraise the available evidence in the light of pertinent scientific theories.\" Also to draft and circulate for comments the proposed NSCID (National Security Council Intelligence Directive). The now famous \"Robertson Panel\" of top scientists, chaired by Dr. H.P. Robertson of the California Institute of Technology, convened Jan. 14-17,1953, to consider the USAF's most impressive UFO cases. All members signed a final report which said the Panel concludes: \"That the evi- dence presented on Unidentified Flying Objects shows no indication that these phenomena constitute a direct physical threat to national security. We firmly believe that there is no residuum of cases which indicates phenomena which are attributable to foreign artifacts capable of hostile acts, and that there is no evidence that the phenomena indicate a need for the revision of current scientific concepts.\" On Jan. 28,1953 Marshall Chadwell, who had originally prepared the draft NSCID for submission to NSC, wrote to the Director of Central Intelligence. After highlighting the conclusions of the Robertson panel, Chadwell wrote: \"Accordingly, it is recommended that no further considera- tion be given to preparation of an NSCID on this subject.\" So the Intelligence Advisory Committee was in-formed by letter dated Feb. 18,1953 that: \"The results of the [Robertson] panel's studies have moved the CIA to con- clude that no National Security Council Intelligence Directive on this subject is warranted.\" (Emphasis added. ) — Philip J.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 298 February 1993"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The NIGHT SKY Walter N7 Webb ° March 1993 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus remains well up in the WSW at dusk early in the month, thereafter, it drops rapidly toward the Sun, decreasing in magnitude from -4.6 to -4.0 and becoming more difficult to find. The 2nd half of March affords an unusually good opportunity to glimpse our planet neigh- bor's thinning and expanding crescent phase in binoculars and telescopes as it orbits closer to Earth. During the last few days of the month, Venus is visible as both \"evening star\" and a \"morning star\" on the same night. A fading Mars (midmonth magnitude 0.2). in Gemini, stands high in the S at dusk and moves westward during the night. Jupiter (-2.5). in Virgo, rises in the E about 2 1/2 hours after sunset early in March. By the 30th, the giant world reaches a point opposite the Sun and at that time rises at sunset, remaining visible all night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky J.- Mars sets in the NW about 3 a.m. in mid month. Jupiter shifts westward all night, setting in the W at sun- rise (on the 30th). Moon Phases: First Quarter - March I Full moon - March 8* O Last quarter - March 14 New moon - March 23 First quarter - March 30. * Nearest Moon of 1 993, producing extra high tides for several days. The Stars: As spring approaches on March 20, Leo the Lion creeps ever closer to the celestial meridian in the S. The lion is rather easy to make out. A reverse question-mark of stars or sickle outlines the beast's head and mane. The dot in the question-mark, the star Regulus. is Leo's heart. A stellar triangle E of Regulus indicates the lion's rear haunches and tail. Behind Leo. Virgo the Maiden (look for a big \"Y\") and Bootes the Herdsman (kite-shaped) ascend above the eastern horizon. Virgo's brightest luminary (overlooking Jupiter) is bluish-white Spica, while Bootes has orange Arcturus, 3rd brightest star in the night sky. The brilliant stars of Orion, and the sparkling Sirius. are still prominent in the SW. William K. Allan 1906-1992 Bill Allan left us on December 1, 1992. This sadly marks the passing of yet another True Pioneer of ufology. Bill was a seasoned veteran of those days when it was difficult at best to admit to an interest in UFOs, much less attempt to study them in a scientific manner, which he most certainly did. His passing leaves a huge void in ufology, and in Canadian ufology especially. W. K. \"Bill\" Allan was born in Manitoba in 1906. He held a B.A. in Honors Mathematics and Physics, and a M.A. in Teaching of Physics. He was a life member of the I.E.E.E., a member of the American Physical Society, the A.A.A.S., and the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. Bill was a field investigator for the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization (APRO). and later for MUFON. He contributed articles to major UFO publications, and was one of the first UFO researchers to devote considerable time to the inves- tigation of what is now known as the abduction phe- nomenon. He worked closely with Dr. J. Allen Hynek on many occasions, and contributed many of the case studies cited in Dr. Hynek's book. The UFO Experience, which to this day is considered the definitive textbook on UFOs. Bill Allan is survived by his wife, Yvonne, and a daughter. He will be sorely missed.

Computerized Reports Patterns David Spencer, Staff Computer Specialist, has noted a few preliminary trends in an initial group of reports entered into his computer. A time distribution indicated that the greatest number of reports occurred at 2100, followed by 1900 and then 2300 local time. Incidentally, none were reported at 0900. The months of October to December and January to March were nearly equally distributed for the number of sighting reports. This small sample was based upon 175 reports, therefore it must be treated as only pre- liminary information. Mr. Spencer has been working close- ly with Ron Johnson, Deputy Director, Investigations, in Austin, Texas.
