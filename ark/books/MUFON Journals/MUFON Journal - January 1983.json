NO! By William H. Banks Writing in the MUFON UFO Journal (No. 172, June 1982) Dr. Louis Walker states: ...I chose to believe the vast majority of what I read (about the 1896/1897 airships in the contemporary newspapers). It.is much more reasonable to believe that nearly all the newspapers in the country are reporting what the populace believes rather than stories conceived in the minds of newspaper employees. My first reaction was incredulity. A cursory examination shows this skepticism to be fully justified. For instance, the New York Times of October 6,1897 reports (under the title \"Will Try His Airship\") that \"...'Gus' Whitehead, an ingenious, young mechanic\" would fly \"his forty-second airship\" on Sunday next. Alas, nothing further was recorded of this determined — if not quite ingenious — young man. It should be noted that, despite the title — or, rather, how it sounds today — Whitehead's airship was a small glider and no pretense was made otherwise. The basic importance of this forgotten (if ever real) feat to UFOlogy is the deadly serious tone of the article and the amorphous nature of the term \"airship\" in the 19th Century press. With such caveats in mind, let us consider the specifics of Dr. Winkler's airships. Most prominent among these is an airship story appearing in the N.Y. Times of December 2, 1897. Dr. Winkler apparently is willing to consider Sir Hiram Maxim as the inventor of an \"airship,\" which made a \"round-trip flight between San Francisco and Cleveland in three days in the summer of 1897.\" Assuming a perfect crow's flight, this would require an average speed of over 100 mph: a performance that no subsequent lighter than air machine ever achieved as a maximum speed! Alas, neither Sir Hiram nor the Times ever again referred to this epochal achievement. In fact, the Maxim design is reminiscent of one proposed by a \"C.A. Smith,\" as recounted in the San Francisco Call of November 25,1896. ! The \"technical\" (Dr. Winkler's term) details are all but identical. Oddly, however, there is no mention of the leadership of the world famed Maxim. A strange reticence, n'est pas? This \"Maximally\" important article from the Times, contradicting as it does all subsequent aviation histories, is worthy of close scrutiny. For example, It has at last been discovered who the incorporators of the Atlantic and Pacific Aerial Navigation Company are. The company, which is offered by C.A. Smith, President (sic), and M.A. Terry, Secretary (sic), both of San Francisco, was organized to manufacture the air-ship of Hiram S. Maxim, inventor of the Maxim gun. (continued on next page) Perseverance, Continued of a jet. Its size would have been twice the width of a full moon. My first thought was that it was a missile, possibly a Cruise Missile. The shape at a glance was similar, also the direction of travel of this elongated, lighted object was similar to the Cruise Missile I had seen on TV news a few months before. At the time I remember frantically fumbling for my 410 mm telephoto camera, which was already adjusted, as best as it could be set for night photography, with color film capable of ASA 1000. This I did without taking my eyes off the object traversing its course from left to right. The 10- second passage of the object was so short that I never managed to actually grasp and lift the camera from its case. I immediately took a writing pad and drew a sketch of the object and made notes on the spot of everything I had observed, plus details of the 4 THE OBJECT unknown itself. I had to rule out a missile because of a number of obvious reasons. Details of the sky visitor were quite unusual- The general overall shape of the sharply outlined craft was similar to that of a carrot or an elongated, stretched out ice cream cone. It was traveling with the large end first. There was no fire or flame emitting from the rather pointed tail end. There was, however, a long, thin, gray-white trail faintly spewing out of the narrow rear about four to five times the length of the body. The object had four large and graduating sized orange, splotchy lighted areas along the length of its pale white body outline as if they may have been large portholes or simply large lighted areas. The most unusual feature was the rounded head portion with what looked like two side-by-side transparent bubbles protruding out from the surface on the front end. It reminded me somewhat of a bug-eyed goldfish. The whole object was illuminated against the darkness of the sky, but not glowing or radiating light to any extent. The orange splotch marks were giving off the most noticeable luminosity. I remained at the spot, intently watching and waiting for about 3 hours, but my vigil was unrewarding. The show was over and I had barely caught the 8:15 \"Express!\"o"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PERSEVERANCE REWARDED By Paul Cerny (MUFON Western Regional Director) Once in awhile, possibly on a somewhat rare occasion, perseverance deserves success. For a 27-year span of diligent investigation and time spent in the \"field\" observing in active remote areas, I have managed to witness a total of seven objects that I could not explain as natural phenomena. This small number of events during this period seems like a meager amount to me considering the time spent observing. These were individual sightings of aerial objects, four of which were very low elevation. The last and most spectacular was observed with Tom Gates, MUFON Astronomy Consultant, near Happy Camp, California in February of 1976. In October 1982, I received a call from a Red Bluff police officer and his dispatcher informing me of an orange sphere that cruised at low level across the highway in front of them as they approached Red Bluff from the east. On December 4th I received a call from Anita Sowles and her husband, who live a few miles south of Red Bluff. This young housewife and dental technician, along with other family members, had a very close encounter (about 90 feet) near Los Molinas, south of Red Bluff, back in the 1960's. Anita, her husband Tim and their two young boys, 5 and 7 years, saw through the windshield of their pickup truck, two large, vivid red balls of light maneuvering ahead of them in the sky as they approached Red Bluff at 7:05 p.m. The balls tilted back and forth, staying the same distance apart and never changed shape or intensity. Occasionally a row of smaller red lights would be seen in between the two large ones, giving a dumbbell appearance. The object gradually dimished in size and after 5 to 7 minutes vanished from view at low level. This, coupled with the police report and the possibility of other sightings not being reported, prompted me to make a trip to the area. Not being VIEW THRU WINDSHIELD able to commandeer anyone to accompany me on such short notice, I made the 250 mile trip alone, arriving Friday evening December 10 at approximately 8:15 p.m. at roughly the general area on Highway 36 where the police reported their encounter. At this 4,000 foot elevation, climbing gradually higher up into the mountainous area toward Lake Almanor, is a Vista Point Lookout area that overlooks the canyon to the north side of the road. The south side of the road also has a deep gradual canyon. Since the other sightings came from and maneuvered slightly to the south side of Highway 36, as it wound its way up through the mountains to the east, I parked the car about 100 feet off the road in the Vista Point parking lot, well out of the path of the occasional passing of the meager traffic. A car would pass, on an average, about one every 10 minutes. I headed the car in a south-by-southeast direction, shut off the lights and engine and opened my camera case in the seat beside me. The moonless sky was clear and dark, except for millions of stars and the dim outline of the high embankment on the opposite side of the highway in front of me. Through the windshield, in the 90 degree arc of my view, I could see a few scrub trees atop the embankment. At about 15 degrees above the elevation over the embankment I could see a heavy telephone cable stretching along the low skyline. I had not been there more than 2 or 3 minutes when something bright, to the extreme left of the windshield, caught my eye. Immediately focusing on the approaching light, my startled and intent gaze riveted onto this speeding object as it sailed across the 90 degrees of arc visible through the windshield. I don't even recall blinking! The object was in sight about 10 seconds before it disappeared from sight to the right. It passed about halfway between the top . of the embankment and the telephone lines, at about a 10 degree elevation, in a perfectly straight path level with the highway. It undulated ever so slightly twice in a downward motion in the first third of its travel in front of me. This movement was so slight it was hardly detectable. (See sketches) Its flight path was taking it on a direct course right for Red Bluff, about 35 miles to the west. The object passed behind a few of the taller scrub trees on top of the embankment, which was roughly 25 to 30 feet above the roadbed. It is of course difficult, under these conditions and references, to estimate size, distance, and speed. I mulled this around in my mind for some time after the sighting. The duration was as near 10 seconds as I could estimate after its passage. A rough estimate of distance would be about a mile, maybe less; the speed, about that .

Continued \"At last\" the \"incorporators\" have been \"discovered!\" As the identities of the APANC founders were printed in the Crocker Langley San Francisco (City) Director of April 1897, this is fair warning that the Times', anonymous \"persons connected with the company\" were untrustworthy. Or worse. The Crocker Langley series offers a small insight into the workings of APANC. The firm did not exist as of the spring of 1896, but arose after the publicity of the original California airship sightings. In 18%, Charles A. Smith was listed in the directory as a \"physician.\" The 1897 edition, published in April of that year, finds him president of APANC. May of 1898 finds Smith still listed as head of the struggling enterprise, but the corporation is now located in the residence of its new secretary, John E. Morson. By 1899, the end has come and Dr. Smith has returned to the healing arts. Thus, the Times story ran as the company's dissolution neared. Most probably, Maxim and the secret flight were introduced by the \"persons\" in a last attempt to bilk a few dollars more. Those with lingering doubts should study the purported engineering with ...naptha for the (lone!) engine ....(to)... be stored in cases, which are supposed to be enough to drive the ship around the earth without replenishing the tanks. If Mr. Berliner 2 is skeptical of this material, his suspicions are only too well founded! Writing previously in the March issue of the Journal (No. 169), Dr. Winkler correctly identifies the craft of \"Prof. Barnard\" as being powered by a bicycle drive device — powered by the pilot's legs! Small wonder its performance had been \"achieved or excelled by at least fifty other contrivances!' \" In passing it should be noted that the speed of the Barnard ship, as given in the article, is comparable with that of the first dirigible ever to successfully return to its place of launch. This latter, La France, was quickly scrapped because it was unable to fly except on the calmest of days. However admirable Barnard's pluck, a successful flight would only have been luck: such an \"airship\" holds no answers for UFOlogy. The Pegasus letter (or letters?) is mentioned by Dr. Winkler as having wide currency in the contemporary press. This is an especially interesting craft with a speed of 150 m.p.h. — and steam power. As John A. Keel acidly notes, here is an answer as to why UFOs are so often reported taking on water? 3 An apparently unrelated message of distress from \"The Airship Travelers\" — Arthur B. Coats of Laurel, Miss., C.C. Harris of Gulfport, Miss., and C.W. Rich of Richburg, Miss., received no acknowledgment from their \"people.\" 4 Other airship tales abound, but — regardless of the number of \"details\" — there is no objective confirmation. With my own (cautious) attitude made plain, here are a (very) few words of encouragement for the romantics. My own great-grandfather was supposedly waved to from a passing airship. A dirigible would often move up and down in a choppy motion in even moderate weather; this does inevitably bring to mind the familiar \"falling leaf motion.\" In 1884, an airship crash was reported with particulars startlingly like those which later afflicted hydrogen lift lighter-than-air craft (LTA's). 5 For historical research, the New York Times is normally the newspaper of first choice, as the \"old girl\" is indexed back to 1853. Unfortunately, \"she\" has always had an aversion for man-bites-dog stories, so UFO reports are few and far between (try \"airship,\" \"balloon,\" etc. in the Index volumes). Those wishing to research 19th Century airships should consult Gregory's Union List of Newspapers 1821-1936 and Newpapers on Microfilm; these will indicate which newspapers near the incident have survived. Normally, the local library will be able to order a microfilm copy free or at very nominal cost. Unhappily, not all newspapers circulate — even on microfilm — while others have never been copied. And remember that the Union List was printed over 40 years ago! In summary, unsubstantiated news accounts of successful airships prove nothing. Chapter 10 of Daniel Cohen's book demonstrates that science fiction hoaxes were hardly unknown in the 19th Century U.S. press. And liars, of course. If not for Jerome Clark, the Hamilton \"cownapping\" would still be regarded as a connection between the murkier side of UFOs, then and now. Those unwilling to trust skeptic Cohen on the condition of the period press are referred to the journalism department of the local college or university. As for a secret invention, Cohen convincingly quotes Thomas Edison, \"It is absurd to imagine that a man would construct a successful airship and keep the matter secret.\" 6 Any such device would have had to elude aviation historians for more than 80 years. The National Security Agency would gape in admiration at such a shroud of secrecy. Airships? To quote Scrooge, \"Bah, humbug!\" A Note on Dr. Winkler's Notes There is an apparent discrepancy in the dates attributed to the New York Times: the NYT Index for 1894-1898 lists stories about Barnard as appearing on May 7 and May 11. Nonetheless, I was unable to find the latter on the microfilm copy. Could the citations for \"Tribune\" and NYT have been • confused?

Ron was the first to speak. \"Vic, did you copy that?\" \"Sure did,\" was the reply. \"Well, I taped it! Harry, did you copy that?\" \"No, I didn't. No, I didn't, Vic, over.\" The signal from Kansas City was weak. Harry was advised that the band was going out, and the San Antonio stations signed with him. A few comments concerning the message were exchanged, and Ron ended the recording. \"Just the Facts\" The transcription of the tape is verbatim, granting optional interpretations of a few words. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent, as the saying goes. Understandably, the radio amateurs involved would rather not be subjected to ridicule and harassment. However, Ron McConnell, as we have called him, assures me that he is willing to cooperate with scientists or serious investigators interested in this case. Ron recorded this transmission on October 14,1980 ,at approximately 8:47 p.m. CDT (0147 UT) on the frequency of 28.530 MHz. Signal strength was observed to vary from S7 down to S3. The beam antenna, which was directed NNE (30 degrees), was a Wilson System Two 4-element tribander at 22 feet (7 meters). A Yaesu FT-901DM transceiver was used. Band conditions were normal for the time of evening. Reflectivity of the upper atmospheric layers normally disappears shortly after dark. On October 17,1980, Ron mailed a copy of the tape with an explanatory letter to the Federal Communications Commission Field Engineering Bureau in Houston, Texas. To date he has received no acknowledgement or reply. Since transmission of an unidentified signal and deliberate interference are both grounds for legal punishment and revocation of amateur licenses, it is most unlikely that any of the three hams whose calls are on the tape would be party to a hoax. What was the voice like? Describing it objectively is a challenge. It is apparently male, of medium tone. and very deliberate. The words are clearly enunciated, although there seems to be an accent which sounds somewhat Spanish. The inflection is rather flat and mechanical for the most part. On first impression, the voice appears to have a computer-generated quality. However, what sounds (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"E-T, Continued suspiciously like breathing is clearly audible between the phrases. The impression is that speech processing with clipping has been used. Subjectively, the communication is quite impressive to most listeners. Much of this may be due to an emotional reaction to the semantic content, of course. Eventually this recording came to the attention of MLJFON member Elmer Romigh, Jr., WA5CTJ, of San Antonio, who recognized its possible importance. Rising before 7 a.m. on Saturday mornings to participate in MUFON amateur radio activity, Elmer reported the matter to the net members in mid-August, 1982. Communications with Texas is often difficult from the upper states at that hour, so that initial details concerning the incident were somewhat confusing. To clarify matters, the author established direct contact with the recording amateur, first by mail, then by telephone and amateur radio. A copy of the tape was obtained in time to provide a transcript to several net members just prior to the second anniversary of the transmission. A number of stations became interested in monitoring the frequency for a possible recurrence, and the investigation was underway. WA5CTJ had suggested that the frequency be monitored on the evening of October 13, and correctly so. The sidereal day is 3 minutes, 56 seconds shorter than the solar day. Band conditions and uncertainty about exactly when a transmission might be expected dictated that observation should occur over a period several days before and after the anniversary date. WA3QLW, net control operator on alternate months, monitored from the Harrisburg, Pa., area but heard no strange broadcasts. Listening in Cincinnati, K8NQN copied a number of Australian stations just below the frequency as well as a Texas station running only 5 watts of power, before the band went out. No extraterrestrials identified themselves, however. Other stations who reported monitoring with negative results were W5UAA in Grove, Okla., and WAOOBN, the mayor of Jamaica, Iowa. No Texas stations reported hearing anything extraordinary. Analysis Let us first of all consider the meaning of the message itself. We are asked to believe that someone 5 light- years away has been able to decipher our language by listening to broadcasts and now wishes to communicate with us. Ten years would be required for each cycle of two-way communication. Obviously our space friend is endowed with an admirable degree of patience as well as longevity. What can we deduce about his QTH (location, to our non- ham readers)? Tabulations of stars nearest the Sun are topped by Alpha Centauri, a triple system at a distance of 4.3 light-years. 1 Next closest is Barnard's star, a double at 6.1 light- years. Dr. Carl Sagan confirmed that there is no suitable star 5 light-years from Earth. He stated that while we might have missed a star at this distance, its luminosity would be so low that essentially no light or heat would be provided to any planets that might be in its system. 2 Alpha Centauri A is described as a . star of spectral type G4. This is a class theoretically capable of sustaining planets habitable by our standards. Alpha Centauri B and C are type Kl and M respectively, while Barnard's star is an M5. Although Barnard's star shows perturbations which may indicate the presence of one or more large planets, these would be close in and rotationally locked due to the small size of their sun. Furthermore, both type K and M stars would literally fry any planets with tremendous doses of radiation. To make matters even worse, multiple stars were considered so unlikely to have habitable planets that they were eliminated from consideration when Marjorie Fish constructed her famous star map based upon Betty Hill's hypnotic recall. 3 Since Alpha Centauri and Barnard's star remain our best possibilities, we need to consider from what direction signals from them would have arrived. Star charts indicate that when the transmission originated, the constellation of Centaurus was setting with most of it already below the western horizon. On the other hand, Barnard's star in Ophiuchus would have been south-southwest, off the back of the beam. Language and mathematics were also discussed in the message. While English was presumably learned by listening to random broadcasts, certain words used are relatively infrequent. How often does one hear the terms \"sidereal,\" \"cipher,\" or \"triad,\" for instance? With regard to mathematics, things look brighter. Reference to the ternary system based on three is particularly intriguing. Presumably our decimal system reflects the fact that our hands have ten digits. It is logical that creatures with three-digited hands would develop a system based either on six or three. Humanoid hands bearing only three digits have indeed been described in at least one well- documented CE-III case.\" 5 Synchronistically, a particularly applicable article appeared at the time • the technical aspects of the signal were being analyzed. The probability of receiving ten-meter signals over interstellar distances is actually addressed by the authors, who are radio amateurs as well as professional engineers working in NASA's SET! (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) program. 6 Incredible power would be required to produce a detectable signal in a normal beam antenna at a distance of 5 light-years. Much higher frequencies in the 1-3 GHz range are postulated to be used for this purpose. Amateur stations are in any case limited to relatively low power (2 kw), while high-power commercial or govenment broadcasts are found at frequencies even lower than 28 MHz. Ordinarily, such stations use only frequencies for which the upper layers of the atmosphere are relfective, when less energy would be radiated into space. One thing can be said for the amateur bands, however. Someone is always listening! The recorded message was received in the single sideband mode. While it could conceivably have been amplitude modulated, this would make the power problem even worse. Single sideband transmission has pre- dominated on ten meters for much (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"E-T, Continued longer than 7 years. However, continuous wave communication in International Morse Code would be even more efficient and is extensively used. Had the signal been barely perceptible, its credibility would be higher. Meter readings were reported to vary between S7 and S3, and the audibility tends to bear this out. In the average communications receiver, this would indicate a signal level of about 40 to 15 micovolts. 7 This is millions of times stronger than could be expected from such a vast distance. If we take the message at face value, we must therefore conjecture some novel means of generating or relaying the signal as well as detecting incredibly weak signals from Earth. Conclusion At this point, three alternative possibilities need to be evaluated in light of the available data: 1. The transmission originated from some unknown source 5 light- years away as stated. Considering the facts, we are forced to agree with Dr., Sagan's comment that the chance of this being true is \"absolutely tiny.\" 2. The incident was a deliberate hoax perpetrated by one or more of the amateurs involved. A number of factors, technical as well as legal, point away from this story. The credibility of the primary witness is high. Amateurs who listen to the taped message and spontaneous comments which followed would have little doubt that it was received as stated. Deliberately inviting punitive action from the F.C.C. would be foolish in the extreme. Neither is the required degree of sophistication present. For instance, the primary witness, believes that the word transcribed \"sidereal\" should be \"Sibereal.\" 3. The transmission was a hoax perpetrated from a terrestrial source by \"someone with a dramatic flair and some scientific knowledge,\" as Dr. Sagan aptly describes him. The slow QSB (fading) evident in the signal strength and voice level indicate that the origin was probably at some distance from San Antonio and 8 was skip propagated. An alternative possibility must be considered, that the signal was local in origin but transmitter power was varied to simulate sky wave. This is rather unlikely. A vast area of Mexico lay off the back of the beam. The witness is emphatic that its front-to-back ratio is high enough to rule out the possibility of receiving a signal of that quality from the rear. That leaves much of Texas and all of Oklahoma, Kansas, and some adjoining states as the most probable source of the signal. There appears to be no reason why the perpetrator would have chosen to break in on that particular QSO (conversation) with his broadcast. No topics had been discussed which might have encouraged a listener to do this, and much of the transmission was a double. The few comments that would have been heard afterward are the only \"kicks\" the originator might have received for a carefully composed and imaginatively delivered message. There seems little harm in publicizing it more than 2 years later. Despite all the evidence we have examined, it cannot be stated that the transmission was definitely a hoax. Our hours of listening on frequency were worthwhile on the slightest chance that it was not. Dr. Sagan stated that he could understand and would even encourage monitoring in subsequent years. The apparent failure of the F.C.C. to bring this matter to the attention of proper authorities in the SETI program is inexcusable. It is to be hoped that channels will be set up in the future to assure timely and expert investigation of such occurrences. Was this message unique, or has it been heard by listeners at other times and on other frequencies? Did anyone else hear it who might be able to localize the source with some certainty? We would welcome other reports of this type. In conclusion, the final words recorded on the tape say it all with simple eloquence. \"Well, I think it's a big old phony, Ron.\" \"Well, I taped it anyway, phony or not!\" \"I believe it might turn out to be one great big old hoax.\" \"But, what if it wasn't? WHAT IF IT WASN'T? Epilogue What if it wasn't, indeed? Whether this particular \"message\" was a hoax or not, SETI is alive and well. Carl Sagan has collected the signatures of 68 prominent scientists and scholars on a document published under the title \"Extraterrestrial Intelligence: An International Petition. 8 It is pointed out that we are now able to communicate with other civilizations in space, if such exist. Using current technology, we could receive signals over a distance of thousands of light-years. An international research effort using existing radiotelescopes is urged. In November, the Wall Street Journal headlinded a report, \"Congress Is Finally Letting NASA Listen for Extraterrestrial Messages. 9 This breakthrough is primarily due to the efforts of Dr. Sagan. He met with Senator William Proxmire and convinced him that NASA's SETI effort was of genuine scientific importance and would not involve major expense. Sen. Promire had previously ridiculed the project, awarding it his \"Golden Fleece\" award and writing prohibitory language into NASA's appropriations bill. These restrictions have now been removed. NASA is building a signal analyzer at a cost of $1.5 million to be used with existing radiotelescopes. The world's largest dish antenna at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, is one of them. Information equivalent to thirteen volumes of the Encylcopedia Britannica will be processed by the analyzer's computer every second. During a period of five years, a thousand solar-type stars will be investigated. According to an article in QST, for an investment of several thousand dollars it would be possible for amateur radio operators to undertake their own private SETI programs on a modest scale. 6 How does SETI affect MUFON and its activities? At the very least, these recent developments represent an official acknowledgement of the possibility that someone may be out there, and a willingness to listen to what (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PROJECT IDENTIFICATION: AUTHOR'S RESPONSE By Harley Rutledge, PhD Jerome Clark (No. 176, Oct. 1982) reprimands Lucius Parish and Bill Leet for defending me against \"personal attack\" by Rodeghier (IUF) andHendry (in FATE). My intent has been to respond only to reviews appearing in scientific journals (The Skeptical Inquirer, for example) but I must speak now, knowing full well that I will reap an escalation of asinine accusations. Clark says that Farish-Leet (F-L) did not raise a single major issue from the Rodeghier-Hendry (R-H) reviews. What, in Clark's opinion, is a major issue? F-L discuss at least eight issues that R-H have raised: my book's title, my writing style, the wrong peak night for seeing UFOs, the \"who cares\" annotations, an incorrect statement of meteor speeds, a disbelief concerning my number of UFO sighting claims, my statement that UFOs are under E-T, Continued they might have to say. Psychologically and sociologically, that represents a real breakthrough. Perhaps 30 years of investigative effort have begun to pay off at last. REFERENCES 1.

Issues raised by R-H are so easily refuted that I am appalled by the reviewers' \"nakedness.\" For example, Rodeghier roots out a \"serious error\" when he writes: \"...Rutledge quotes a speed of 36,000 m.p.h. for one UFO, and states that the speed is greater than that of the fastest meteors.\" Evidently Rodeghier does not read with comprehension. On page 27, Project Identification, I refer to a red light that passed overhead in 1953, traveling from horizon to horizon in an estimated 4 seconds at one-mile altitude. I continue: \"...Assuming that the horizon to horizon distance was 40 miles, the speed of the light was 36,000 miles per hour! At an assumed altitude of 10 miles, the light's speed would have been greater than that of the fastest meteors.\" If Rodeghier had multiplied 36,000 by the ten in the second sequence quoted, he could have arrived at 360,000 m.p.h., not 36,000 m.p.h. Further, I reference on page 17 from a popular astronomy text (George Abell) that meteors have speeds \"ranging from 30,000 to 160,000 miles per hour.\" Note that 160,000 is considerably less that 360,000. After blunders like this, how can we trust the judgment of this reviewer! He made other mistakes too, as did Hendry. For instance, Hendry is critical because we did not make inquiries to the \"local Federal Aviation Administration\" while a sighting was in progress. What Hendry doesn't know — and never checked — is that our FAA Flight Service Station did not have a control tower until late 1973 and has neuer had radar, meaning that contact with aircraft was by visual sighting and/or by radio. We had a radio receiver in the field that had the aviation band of frequencies. Such befuddlement on the part of the former chief field investigator for CUFOS does, in my opinion, disqualify him to render credible judgement. Further, I wonder if CUFOS personnel are \"tuned in\" to the real UFO phenomena. Consider this statement appearing in the Boone County Headlight newspaper of Harrison, Arkansas on October 7, 1982: \"...an official at the Center for UFO Studies has taken the sighting seriously, noting how unusual it is for 10 people to view a UFO.\" Only ten! Perhaps, as F-L suggest, CUFOS should mount a field study to learn what UFOs are about. Maybe Rodeghier shouldn't exhibit such incredulity at my claim of having seen 158 UFOs, 40 from my yard. I don't know what Clark considers a standard of propriety and good manners, but surely the phantom editor who wrote \"who cares\" in the margins of my book far exceeds the bounds of professional, if not civil, behavior. Then, consider the antics of Hendry who persists in trying to persuade a member of one of my field teams (an undergraduate at the time) to impugn my integrity and/or competence. These sordid actions and disparaging reviews may not be an attack on my \"person- ality\" (Clark's word), but I consider them an assault on my character.

We try to ascertain exactly what was observed in a given incident and what caused it to occur in the first place. We seek evidence which will either establish a UFO connection or eliminate it from consideration. In the area of UFO crash/retrieval stories, for example, investigators spend their time checking into the veracity of various accounts and searching for corroborating witnesses — which is what one might expect. Yet there is another mode of inquiry which nicely outflanks this quest for direct evidence, a mode which requires us to make a basic theoretical assumption. I suggest that we temporarily assume that a UFO did in fact crash and that its remains were retrieved by a government agency. Since intelligence methods are to some extent predictable, we can begin to speculate as carefully as possible on what procedures the government might take to conceal this secret. Several major UFO organizations have within their ranks former intelligence officers from various services who are very sympathetic to the idea of UFO investigations; in fact, the first director of the CIA served on the board of NICAP. Also, many UFO investigators have amongst their friends and acquaintances people who once served in such organizations, and who are genuinely interested in the UFO phenomenon. So I propose that groups of these veterans of intelligence work be brought together in conference settings to draw up probable — though hypothetical — sets of procedures that might be followed if such a crash/retrieval event has in fact occurred. All of this speculation would be firmly based on their own experiences in handling analogous secret affairs. They could explore many questions, such as: Which branches of 10 the service would most likely be involved? Which \"disinformation\" methods and ideas might be employed? How might a \"need-to-know\" hierarchy be established? Which scientists might be consulted? And so on, through many issues that I, having never been involved in government intelligence work, might never begin to imagine. 1 The advantages of possessing such a list of likely intelligence procedures from such a reliable source would be obvious — it would provide UFO investigators with a kind of checklist against which they could compare their own findings so far, and perhaps clarify some of the puzzling information and official behavior they have encountered. It might strongly support — or strongly undermine — the idea that the government secretly possesses the wreckage of a crashed UFO, but at the least it would open a new avenue of inquiry. Any investigator must admit that speculating about the nature of UFOs, their purposes, origins or methods, is skating on the thinnest of ice. We do, however, know something about ourselves, about human psychology, and about predicting military ways of handling intelligence problems; earth- bound speculation is always less chancey. And so when we turn to the issue of UFO abduction reports the same situation prevails. As a temporary alternative to searching for confirming evidence we can think around the problem by first assuming that the abduction accounts happened as reported. We can then pursue a different line of inquiry, focused on the ways so dramatic an event might affect an individual abductee. Psychologists have described they symptoms frequently encountered in rape victims, for example, or in survivors of sudden traumatic accidents. Dr. Robert J. Lifton's book Death in Life examines and to some extent codifies the \"survivor syndrome\" as it manifested itself among those who survived Hiroshima. There are precedents for people — especially rape victims — whose encounters were so traumatic that they have somehow \"forgotten\" them. Unfortunately, the experience of being kidnapped — taken and held by terrorists — is no longer such a rare and exotic event, and there are psychological studies of hostage behavior which establish certain patterns. Women, for example, seem generally to stand up better in these circumstances than men. Apart from the issue of physical violence, UFO abductions are analogous in many ways to just this kind of unusual traumatic event. \"Hostages\" are taken and held against their will, there is often a physical invasion of the body, the victim fears for his or her life, and above all, he or she does not understand what is happening, or why. The psychologist, therefore, becomes a useful ally in ways similar to those in my previous example, in which the former intelligence officer can aid UFO investigation. Dr. Aphrodite Clamar, with whom I have worked in a number of abduction cases, has discerned consistent patterns among the abductees in their ability to \"handle\" such experiences. Women re- experience the event more calmly than men, for example, while men who were sixteen or seventeen when they were abducted seem to have had the greatest personal difficulties dealing with their encounters, no matter how old they are when they recall the details. 2 The Fund for UFO Research has provided Dr. Clamar, Ted Bloecher, and myself a sum of money for full psychological testing of ten abductees, the tests having been administered by a psychologist who knows nothing about the purpose of the tests or any UFO connection. The results will be published, we hope, in the next few (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEW Evolution From Space (The OMNI Lecture): And Other Papers on the Origin of Life (Hillside, N.J.: Enslow Publishers) $8.95. Did life evolve on Earth from some unique beginning, or was it part of some larger cosmic process? That question is loaded with emotional value and can give rise to spirited support or rigid rejection. Evolution From Space can only add to the argument. According to Sir Fred Hoyle, Darwinian theory (i.e. natural selection operating on randomly-generated mutations) cannot explain the evolution of plants and animals which is known to have occurred. To emphasize this belief, he cites the stability of the genetic material, DNA double-helix, and how copying errors are so slow they could have only minor effects on evolution. That, coupled with the existence of missing links, leads him to the conclusion that evolution is not driven from within as in conventional biology, but from without — cosmically. Religious issues are addressed right up front. He points out that religion is not primitive in a biological sense; rather, it is unique to man and becomes stronger the more advanced man becomes in intellectual attainments. He vigorously attacks the \"fanciful adornments with which religion has become traditionally surrounded.\" It is difficult to argue about the human need to understand the origin of life; but Sir Fred's answer is bound to spark controversy. Even so, his theory is reinforced by his scholarly proofs. He argues against life emerging from non- living matter on Earth. Part of that argument centers on the first formation of sedimentary rock about 3.8 million years ago and the signs of life found in rocks from the Isau region on West Greenland dating to the same time. Sir Fred contends that the Earth was infected with complex life forms that easily evolved after their arrival. He doesn't try to pinpoint the exact location of the initial starting place of life, or how it happened. He does provide examples. One contention is that bacteria are explosively propagated throughout the galaxy. His evidence is complex and far reaching; ranging from the amino acids found in the carbonaceous Murchison Evidence, Continued months, One of the things we would like to know is whether or not the test results are similar to those of victims of violent crimes, rape, traumatic accidents, or other psychically scarring events. These test results can be studied and compared by experts in these other survivor areas without our having to divulge the nature of our sample. Veterans of intelligence work can tell us if investigators into the UFO crash/retrieval area are encountering the sorts of things they should (or should not) expect to encounter, assuming the event occurred. In the area of abductions psychological evaluation and careful, objective testing can help us see if these individuals did in fact suffer the degree of psychic trauma one might expect if they had had this kind of experience. By assuming particular UFO incidents are facts we can speak with some certainty about their inevitable effects on humankind. In this way informed speculation can become a powerful tool of investigation, helping us to uncover the truth. NOTES 1. Laymen like myself can gain some idea of the Byzantine ways of modem intelligence services in such a book as F.W. Winterbotham's The Ultra Secret, (Dell, 1974). It deals with the complex methods the British Secret Service used in World War II to conceal the fact that they had broken the \"Ultra\" code of the German High Command. Thousands had to know the secret, yet it remained a secret for over 20 years. 2. In two cases involving boys of sixteen and seventeen respectively, each developed serious drinking problems within a few months of their abductions. In a third instance, a sixteen year old boy, who had been stable and healthy prior to his experience, went deeply into alcohol, then drugs, and a few years later committed suicide. The girl who had been abducted with him also has serious ensuing problems but she survived them and is now a healthy, stable 30-year-old business executive.

Other evidence cited includes the content of interstellar clouds — gaseous molecular hydrogen, three dozen or so organic molecules, and tiny dust particles. Those dust particles appear to resemble terrestrial bacteria. In more recent times the successive appearances of smallpox, outbreaks of canine viral diseases, and successive epidemics of influenza could be explained as an invasion from space. He argues against the dogma of science caused by the strong belief of the proponents; then proceeds to state the following hypothesis: \"Interstellar grains are bacteria.\" Proponents of the theory that UFOs represent the spacecraft of distant worlds in space will probably cite Sir Fred's works as proof that we have been visited. The church may charge him with heresy. Biologists, astronomers, thermodynamicists, and others will see him as attacking the foundations of science and some may dismiss him without a trial. Maybe he has moved a step closer to resolving the traditional differences between science and religion. On the other hand, perhaps he has just moved the problem from Earth to the depths of interstellar space. Whatever the case may be, he has not resolved the issues of how and where life began. Instead, he has issued a larger challenge to science. Given sufficient time man will sample the interstellar dust — then we will have the answer. Or will we ? -John F. Schuessler.

Bryant* A \"Space Case\" before her time. That's my appraisal of the persona of Enid Joan Brady. Had she inaugurated her UFO contacteeism in 1982 rather than in 1952, she would be winning not only the tolerance (if not quasi-respect) o' modern paranormalists, but also the attention of such cultural buffer zones as TV's \"That's Incredible!\" But back in the fifties and sixties — in her heyday as a maverick among public practitioners of the ancient art of spirit communication — Brady faced rejection not just from the public at large; she also incurred disdain of the traditionalists in the spiritualist religion. Her faux pas? Simply diverting her mediumship from the accepted practice of communicating with discarnate spirits to the unsanctioned (hence unauthorized) practice of telepathically communicating with alien space \"entities.\" Her deviation from the spiritualist norm wouldn't have been so notorious had she kept it confined to her close friends/relatives/True Believers who were involved with her ministry at the Little White Church in Holly Hill, Fla. (near Daytona Beach). But with the urging and inspiration of her associate Robert Ewing, she made her second mistake: she went public. That's when I arrived on the scene — albeit in the role of long-distance observer and chronicler of the Brady Phenomenon. My introduction to her activity came in the form of an article written by the then religion editor of the Associated Press, George W. Cornell, back on October 18, 1957. Titled \"Some Spiritualists Think Venusians Are about to Land,\" the article reviews Brady's alleged revelations and Ewing's efforts to institutionalize them. It also highlights Brady's detractors, quoting the disbelief of two officials of organized spiritualism in this country. Ewing's role in the communi- cations process of Brady's trance- 12 derived contact with the \"master teachers of Venus\" was to tape-record the sessions. These involved a dialogue between him and Brady as the Venusians would take over her body and vocal chords. Said Ewing of the telepathic process: \"I thought it was all a lot of bunk at first. I'm a practical guy, and I didn't believe it. But now I've talked to them enough to know it.\" The article proceeds to detail certain key elements of the Brady- Ewing revelations: • Since the early fifties, from an orbiting base above the southeastern United States, the omniscient, benevolent visitors from Venus have been carrying out their mission of saving us from our destructive selves. • Back home on Venus, the inhabitants — who look like us but generally are taller and finer-featured — worship God, believe in life-after-death, nurture a highly advanced civilization, and live to be several hundred years old. • On their beautiful planet, all disease has been conquered, clairvoyance and telepathy are the normal means of communications (at the rate of 50,000 words per minute), and homes are built on a type of nylon- rubber-plastic substance. • By 1962, after a planned increase in intermittent landings of Venusian spaceships on Earth, a \"new age\" for Earthlings will be ushered in. \"Token landings,\" to use Bob Ewing's descriptor, would begin in November 1957. With the perspective of 25 years hence, many of us still await the New Age of progress, contentment, spiritual enrichment — or whatever it's supposed to represent. What Science has shown about the living conditions on Venus tells us that the planet is sister to Earth in name only. But as UFO historians can document, there was a rash of UFO encounters — including some landings — back in the fall of 1957. Coincidence, perhaps; or the result of mass hysteria promoted by such publicity as the \"Brady Bunk\" (to use a phrase welcomed by superskeptics of UFO reality)? Whatever their cause, the UFO manifestations reinforced Ewing's own commitment to Brady's work. In the third issue (August 1958) of his newsletter The New Era, he wrote: Last November's outbreak of \"saucer sightings\" were (sic) announced by Miss Brady and your editor to the press, radio and TV before they occurred. Now once again we are told to prepare our readers and others we meet to expect a great amount of sightings of ventlas (\"spaceships\"—Ed.) beginning with the date August 7th and continuing for five months following that date. If that 5-month window on UFO activity didn't exactly offer a spectacular view, no matter. For, as time has shown, Brady & Co. would have to face a so-so record at best on the various revelations and prophecy gleaned from her contacts. To this day, though, she asserts that \"so much of what we received has come to pass.\" One such proven datum imparted by the spacepeople: the velocity needed to sustain the orbit of an Earth-made satellite (18,000 mph). Not content with using the media to spread the Space Gospel According to Enid Brady, Ewing embarked on the lobbyist trail to Washington, D.C. Since, at age 41 back in mid-1957, he was a paid'Up member of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), he chose to seek advice and support from them. He wrote a 4-page, single-spaced-typed letter to AOPA vice-president Max Karant; in it he traced the development of his interest in and experience with psychic phenomena, leading into a summary of his association with Enid Brady. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Brady, Continued After reviewing the efforts of the \"ventla fleet\" to \"mop up\" or otherwise neutralize our atomic-bomb-test residue in Earth's atmosphere, he dwelt on the prospect of intensified publicity for his cause. Then he devoted a few sentences to an issue that endures to this day: crash-landed flying saucers allegedly retrieved by U.S. military authorities. \"Now comes a touchy one,\" acknowledged Ewing. \"I asked, under what circumstances they might be willing to land and talk with us. I was told that they had indeed landed — two years ago — they weren't Venusians, but Martians and they landed 'at Muroc Lake, which you now call Edwards Air Base.' Studies since their landing, of their ship, resulted in our present-day 'flying wings' and vertical-flight jobs. \"The Martians were taken into 'what I think you call protective custody.' In answer to my query, I was told, yes, that they were still imprisoned. I asked where they were kept (thinking to use it later as proof to give to the Air Force to obtain belief); I was told 'it would do you no good to know.' However, I am sure that I can find out if needed to prove to the Air Force.\" Ewing's pilgrimage to Washington also included contact with the privately funded National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), whose leadership at that time was quite hostile to the generally unsupported claims of the cultish \"contactees.\" In a letter to then NICAP director Maj. (Ret.) Donald E. Keyhoe, Ewing further pled his case: Perhaps you can correlate something with me: do you find more \"low altitude\" sightings in the cold winter months than in hot months — or greater frequency of sightings in northern latitudes as compared with southern latitudes? In a recent contact with our \"ventla pilots,\" they promise \"good landings\" in the month of November and the months to follow. They explain that our atmosphere during these colder months permits the ventla to operate better at low altitudes then. Conversely, they encounter trouble with low-altitude flying, and landing, during summer months of warm weather. As you can see, we are hard at work amassing the much desired \"proof that everyone wishes. In a contact yesterday, the pilots state that they might put the snatch on the next guided missile and take it as soon as it was launched. In this same contact, they say they deliberately steered our guided missile off course and caused it to land in Brazil. Since they recently advised us that they would begin now to fly at 20,000 feet most of the time, I've arranged a light signal that can be employed between them and the airline pilots — and hope I find time to write the airline boys as to the code to employ. Also on Ewing's agenda for that summer of 1957 was a vist to the Pentagon, where he planned to play some of his tape recordings to an audience of hopefully interested officials. If AOPA, NICAP, and USAF officials were less than receptive to Ewing's crusade on behalf of Enid Brady, he in retrospect might agree that the blurb he chose as part of his letterhead stationery contributed to their aloofness: \"Representing the Planet Venus.\" As for Brady herself, she kept busy for the next several years, receiving the spacepeople's messages and instructions and making the transcribed material available via a mimeographed newsletter called Space Bulletin. The newsletter was a curious blend of mystic philosophy, quasi- scientific discourse on the technical aspects of space travel, commentary on Earth's international politics, warnings about environmental pollution, and prophetic announcements about natural disasters and ventla-induced urban electrical blackouts. But the Venusians/Martians seemingly were incapable of protecting their communicating channel — Brady — from being intimidated by her fellow Earthlings. For, in early January 1967, she wrote me about having received a threatening phone call. She said it so unnerved her that she decided forthwith to suspend publishing the Bulletin. She suspects the man making the call was a CIA operative. In the intervening years since that last letter from her, I've read about a number of other UFO contactees whose means of communication with the \"aliens\" was mental rather than Fort Bliss, Texas, MONITOR June 24-, 1982 A collection of strange and unusual happenings across the Southwest com- piled by Rene Stutzman in Dallas.

Hers wasn't the first, nor will it be the last, such case of alleged telepathic contact with, extra- terrestrials. What intrigues me, now, about Brady's case is that (1) she apparently is continuing her contact (albeit under a low profile) and that (2) there might be a verifiable record, somewhere, of that alleged telephonic threat of 16 years ago. In an effort to bring myself up-to- date on her status, I called her on April 16, 1982. Now a grandmother, she says that mainly for her family's sake and for her own peace of mind, she's keeping her current space-contact work on the \"hush-hush side\" of her ministry. In the early years, she recalled, she had to endure what amounted to, in her words, \"torture\" — that derision and rancorous disbelief on the part of the unenlightened public. When I invited her to cooperate with me in using the U.S. Freedom of Information Act to pry loose any official government records about her activity, she declined, saying, in response to my proposed article about her career, \"I do not wish to open that door.\" *Larry W.

Nicmtzow, M.D. Alleged Medical Injuries From Intense Luminous Sources Stated To Be Unidentified Flying Objects: Project UFOMD Report No. 1 Project UFOMD is an internation- al study of medical injuries associated with alleged UFO close encounters. Information dealing with this project has been published previously. 1 Reports of intense lights associated with medical injuries are now well documented in the UFO literature. The necessity of qualified medical observations is emphasized in dealing with these cases. A multitude of information may be obtained from the victims from observation alone which may explain the mechanisms of the injury event and substantiate further the UFO phenomena. An excellent example to consider is that of the Cash-Landrum case reported very professionally by Mr. John Schuessler. Strictly from the information reported in the MUFON UFO Journal, November 1981, it would be feasible to assume that the principals might have been exposed to some type of non-ionizing or ionizing radiation. I would like to consider first a clinical model for non-ionizing radiation and then a clinical model for ionizing radiation. I will only speculate what occurred in the Cash-Landrum case because I never examined or had access to their medical records. There is much confusion and misunderstanding in the UFO literature about the relationship of medical injuries to radiation. It will be appropriate to clarify several fundamental aspects of radiation effects on biological systems. First let's define radiation. Radiation is an emission of energy in the form of photons and/or particles. The photons actually represent electromagnetic radiation which for our purposes and interest are in the upper end of the spectrum and in order of 14 decreasing wavelength include microwave, ultraviolet, gamma or x- ray. Particulate radiation consists of betas, protons, alpha particles, neutrons, mesons, heavy charged ions (e.g., nitrogen, carbon, neon, boron) just to name a few. All of these radiations deliver an energy insult to living matter. These take the forms of heat and ionization. Heat destroys the proteins which are the machinery of life. Ionization damages the DNA essential for the control and reproduction of life. Actually this is. an extreme simplification of an immensely complex subject called radiobiology. A few more terms need to be defined and then we can quickly proceed. The term ionization simply means energetic ejection of one or more orbital electrons from an atom or molecule by either a photon or particle. The more energetic the ejected electron the more chances for damage in living tissue. Ionization does not involve microwaves. Roentgen is a unit used to characterise the amount of x- ray or gamma radiation exposure in air and is expressed in terms of producing a certain amount of ionized air. The RAD is a unit of radiation absorption in living tissue and is measured as the amount of energy deposited into tissue. Having defined a few terms we are ready to tackle superficially how this information will be useful in radiation- like injuries involving intense lights/unidentified flying objects. Several years ago I published a clinical sketch that delineated a series of physiological events that are well known to ufologues. 2 Briefly, the witness observes an intense light which may be associated with olfactory, auditive, and motor paralysis manifestations. The olfactory detection of odor is of course unexplained. However, an excellent paper by Thomas M. Olsen, \"UFO Odors and Origins,\" Journal of UFO Studies, Vol. Table 1.

He summarizes that the reported characteristic UFO odors are attributed to externally producing oxidizing agents, ozone and NO 2 /N 2 O 4 , and their reaction with methy alcohol and/or benzene which may be implicated as an energy source in disc UFOs. The sounds experienced by the witness may be attributed to microwave radiation. In recent years, attention has been given to the so- called microwave \"hearing\" effect. Under certain specific conditions of frequency signal modulation and intensity, it has been shown that animals and humans can perceive a radio frequency signal as if it were heard. One hypothesis that explains this is that a microwave signal produces thermoelastic pressure within the skull that is in turn perceived as sound by the auditory apparatus. 3 I have described the paralysis problem elsewhere and remind the reader that the victim does not fall in the majority of cases. 2 , 4 The exact mechanism of this paralysis (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Radiation, Continued remains poorly understood. Further physiological events occur in the second clinical stage: The victim experiences several hours to several days later, skin burns, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, conjunctivitis, and general malaise. 2 > 4 > 5 Because no one is sure what radiation is being emitted by this phenomenon we will examine some physiological effects of microwave, radiofrequency, atomic, and ultraviolet radiation. To keep ourselves organized I am including a chart of the electromagnetic spectrum. 6 The known effects of microwaves on animals and humans will be summarized. It is beyond the scope of this paper to expand this subject. Microwave effects appear to be principally thermal, similar to conventional electrical burn injuries, but with some unique systemic expression. Derangements of cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal, endocrine, hematological, ophthalmp- logical, and behavioral function are well described in animal experimentation. To complicate the matter even more, radiofrequency radiation can also produce similar nonthermal systemic effects. Some of these are summarized in the accompanying table. 6 Direct contact with radio- frequency electrodes can produce thromboses of arteries and veins. Thus depending on the vascularization territory affected, there will be areas of healthy tissue and injured tissue. 6 Low dose atomic radiation known for producing skin burns and systemic perturbations are we|l known and may mimic many of the symptoms of biological damage seen in microwave and radiofrequency exposures. The difficulty is to differentiate between the two types of radiation. Unfortunately, this may be a difficult task for the inexperienced observer involved in a UFO case. For example, depending on the RAD dose and energy of the photon emission, gamma radiation injury to the face can be selective. We know that 2,000 RADS produces alopecia, but eyelashes and eyebrows have their own selective radiation injury thresholds. Whole body and localized radiation Table 2. Physiological Effects Central nervous system Altered circadian rhythms Behavorial changes EEC alterations Acoustic stimulations Cardiovascular system Hypotension Bradycardia Hematological Depressed immunity Depressed lymphocytes Depressed phagocytes Altered bone marrow Ophthalmological Cataracts Retinal damage Gastrointestinal Increased motility Endocrine Increased adrenocorticoids Depressed thyroid play differently on the hematological system. Different cell populations are depressed depending upon the radiation field location and area. The systemic problems such as listed under the radiofrequency and microwave effects also occur. Ultraviolet overexposure besides producing skin burns can also result in fever, chills, weakness, shock, and manifestations due to hyperpyrexia. We are aware of our own experience with severe sun burn. In the Cash-Landrum case the medical injury catalogue described by John Schuessler presents injuries which can be produced by all of the radiations described above. If the reader carefully exploits the information given in the case, it is possible to medically appreciate the event but only superficially. That is why I emphasize the importance that similar cases be brought to the attention of Project UFOMD in order that the victims can be evaluated rapidly and precisely in the context of the event. The eventual medical data must be in- depth and follow standard medical reporting practices. 1 - 5 ' 7 The reward may be a substantial amount of information directly related to the UFO phenomenon. In May 1982, the author was solicited as a consultant to the U.S. Army Inspector General's Office, Washington, D.C., dealing with the Cash-Landrum Case. Their responsibility was to identify the apparent source of the medical injuries; namely, the helicopters. An in-depth effort to locate these helicopters was undertaken. They could not be identified as an Army mission. The medical data used by the author was solely that reported by various UFO journals. Clearly there is the need for better medical data gathering and reporting which has now become our responsibility by way of default. REFERENCES 1.

We hear of something called Bigfoot or Sasquatch in North America, particularly the Pacific Northwest, and the yeti or abominable snowman in the Himalayas. The entire Bigfoot/yeti issue bears striking similarities to the issue of UFOs as extraterrestrial spacecraft. On both the Bigfoot and the UFO issues, there are thousands of reported \"sightings.\" But there is not one case where solid evidence is found to \"prove\" that Bigfoot exists, or that craft from outer space exists. (Incidentally, the term Bigfoot is often popularly extended to such animals as the one that makes that strange cry out in the woods, even as \"UFO\" is popularly stretched to include such objects as planets and balloons.) On both these issues, many people want to believe. Many people are looking for evidence. But there still isn't any evidence that stands up. I was struck by these and other similarities with UFOs when reading Bigfoot, an excellent recent book by Kenneth Wylie, 1 who appears to have conducted extensive and thorough research into the issue, particularly the North American. aspects of it. He admits to the charm of the story and indicates he would like to believe that Bigfoot is stomping around out there in the deep woods. But: What does it eat? If it does not hibernate (no primate does), it must be carnivorous, at least in the winter when heavy snows cover the ground. But apes are vegetarian and are found in tropical forests; it's unlikely that the animal would have adapted to a colder climate and a different diet. Quoting Dr. Richard W. Thorington Jr, head primatologist in the department of vertebrate zoology at the National Museum of Natural History at the 16 Smithsonian: \"The existence of a large primate such as Bigfoot, especially in North America, is almost an impossibility, biologically speaking.\" Why is it that no one has ever found the body of such an animal after an accidental or natural death? Why are there no acceptable photographs of such an animal? Quoting Rene Dahinden, a longtime Bigfoot searcher: \"Some researchers say, 'look at all the thousands of reports we have; that proves beyond any question that there is something there.' I'm going in exactly the opposite direction. The more reports we are getting, the more unlikely it is that the damned thing exists. Because if we have that many reports, then we should have collected the damn thing long ago.\" How is it that no one has tracked down and shot one after all this time? Why is it that Bigfoot is usually \"seen\" alone? Why is it that there is virtually no data on young or even half- grown offspring of such animals? Most reports are of footprints, but Wylie believes that sublimation of snow — melting combined with quick refreezing — accounts for many such footprints. Animal tracks in snow enlarge as a result of melting in the sun, and even experienced mountaineers are taken in by such finds. He reports an expert's restudy of 19 well-known examples of yeti footprints photographed in the Himalayas since 1915. Seven were judged to be of bears, two human, one langur, and one composite. Of the remainder, one had the feet pointing backwards, four were tentatively identified as wolf tracks or superimposed tracks, and three had too short a stride to be primate. In North America, he believes only the Olympic Peninsula in northwestern Washington is lush enough to hide Bigfoot in the number that would be \\ URNITURE HUTLET Store sign in Seguin, Texas necessary to keep the species going. Wylie, as part of his research, hiked through some of this rugged country. One day in the woods he stopped, ate his lunch, then dozed. He woke with a start — and saw a huge creature glowering at him from beyond the inner ring of trees! After a few terror filled seconds, he refocused his eyes and realized he was looking at a tree that had been splintered by lightning. Like Wylie, we \"see\" partly what we expect and want to see, and what we see (or properly, how we interpret what we see) depends partly on our state of mind — in this case, the difference between being fully awake and still partly asleep. Which gives another connection with UFOs: So many UFO \"sightings\" come during alternate states of consciousness (during a long and tiring drive on a lonely road late at night, during hypnosis, during an experience that throws us into shock, etc.) 1.

Schuessler, Steering Committee Chairman for the North American UFO Federation, distributed Newsletter No. 5 to committee members. A draft copy of the By-Laws was enclosed with a letter requesting suggestions for proposed revisions. A target date of July 1,1983 has been set to adopt By-Laws, select the initial 18 Board of Directors, Trustees, and conceivably to be incorporated, so the officers (Executive Committee) may be elected by the Board of Directors at the first annual corporate meeting. This is an ambitious undertaking and goal, however, through Mr. Schuessler's fine leadership the progress has been very good, making the targeted goal date achievable. Since there are many UFO groups in North America who were not represented at the 1982 UFO Summit Meeting in Toronto, they are being invited at this time to indicate their sincere interest in being part of the new federation by writing to John F. Schuessler, P.O. Box 58485, Houston, TX 77258-8485 U.S.A. It was with sincere regret that Elizabeth Philip, Editor, was forced to announce that the magazine Frontiers of Science was discontinuing publication for financial reasons. She has suggested alternatives to current subscribers in the form of books to recoup outstanding subscription payments. One of the alternatives proposed to their subscribers is the substitution of the MUFON UFO Journal for the Frontiers of Science to complete their current subscription. Each subscriber will make their choice under these conditions. This appears to be an opportunity for the MUFON UFO Journal to expand the number of our subscribers and MUFON membership in the future, since this invitation would only be accepted by people who are not presently subscribers to the Journal. Details of the agreement between MUFON and the Frontiers of Science magazine will be published in the February 1983 issue of the Journal. Joaquim Fernandes, MUFON Representative for Portugal, has provided an activity report and projects underway, which includes a study of 100 CE HI Iberian cases that will be of special interest to the MUFON Humanoid Study Group. Sr. Fernandes is also announcing the publication of the book titled Marian Apparitions, a 6-year research study concerning the Fatima miracle. Published in Portuguese, this 460-page book was co-authored by Fina d'Armador, a distinguished historian, and edited by Livraria Bertrand. The UFOs and ANTHROPOIDS: A SUMMARY By Mark Moravec Is there a UFO/anthropoid connection? In response to this question, I compiled the UFO/ Anthropoid Catalogue consisting of over 70 cases worldwide. The reports were categorized as — AUFO 1: UFO and anthropoid events occurring at the same time and location, and in the presence of the same witness. AUFO 2: UFO and anthropoid events occurring in the same location over a short period of time. AUFO 3: No UFO event, but anthropoid event is accompanied by features typical of some UFO events. Most cases occurred between 1972 and 1976, and in the USA. The . majority of cases were categorized as AUFO 2. Thus far, five Australian UFO/anthropoid reports have been uncovered. However, all of these cases are of low evidential weight. The reports vary widely in the thoroughness of investigation and degree of unambiguous detail. There are indications that UFO and anthropoid phenomena share some common characteristics. However, there are also indications that the UFO- related anthropoid may be different from the classic \"Bigfoot\" creature. There are at least six hypotheses which may explain some or all (continued on next page) book may be purchased from Livraria Bertrand, Rua Garret, Lisboa, Portugal for $9.00 (U.S. Dollars).

This column has been sadly missed by investigators, as a means of identifying planets, bright stars and meteor showers in the night skies. Starting with this issue of the Journal, we are very pleased to announce that Alvis L. Barrier, M.D., an ama- teur astronomer, who is on the Board of the University of Texas McDonald Observatory will be writing a monthly column that will be pre-dated several months so as to make it a current and valuable tool for readers. Dr. Barrier, a surgeon, is also the State Sec- tion Director for Guadalupe County in Texas. He and his family reside at 214 Milford Lane, Seguin, TX 78155. Of major interest to astronomers around the World, is the installation of a new three hundred inch optical telescope at the McDonald Observatory in the Davis Mountains in west Texas. It will be the largest in the World, having one and one-half times the diameter of the lens in the telescope on Mount Palomar in California. We are extremely proud to have an astronomer of Dr. Barrier's status write our as- tronomy column. His column is uniquely titled \"AFO Column\" (Astro- nomic Flying Objects). AFO Column by Al Barrier, M.D. . What are AFOs? Astronomical flying objects!, i.e. planets, stars, comets, meteors, etc. It's my pleasure to help acquaint you with the northern latitude night sky each month. Afterall, avoiding confusion about what is normally in the heavens will help each of us to be more aware of unusual occurrences in the same arena. April offers us a superb opportunity to view the bright plan- ets. Mercury reaches greatest elevation above the western horizon on April 21. Forty-five minutes after sunset, it floats eleven degrees above the horizon. This appearance of Mercury is the only time in 1983 we can see the planet setting after evening twilight. Mercury will be easily detectable just above the horizon starting April 15, and continuing until May approaches. As Mercury sets and twilight ends, Saturn rises in the south- east, pursuing the bright star Spica in the constellation Virgo (south of and midway between the constellation Leo and Bootes;. Saturn is brightest on April 22. Look at the planet with good binoculars and you will get a hint of its rings, which are tilting, thus providing a good view. Venus remains a superb sight for the next several months for British and North American viewers. During April, Venus is almost at its highest altitude above the western horizon. By Mayday, Ve- nus sets well over three hours after sundown at -3.6 magnitude (very bright) and 40 degrees elongation from the Sun. What about Jupiter? Jupiter's big event will be its being swallowed by the Moon on the morning of April 2nd. The Moon will be three quarters lit, and waning. East Coast viewers will be out of luck, but those in the southern states will be able to"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"catch Jupiter's disappearance behind the Moon before the pair dips below the horizon. Of course the big drawback is sunrise. Only those in the west and southwest will see the confrontation before the Sun comes up. By months end, Jupiter will be back in the night sky, rising in the east about two hours after sunset. Planets are not the only solar system bodies to look for in April„ After moonset early on the morning of April 21 and 22, the Lyrid meteors will be speeding from overhead throughout most of the United States. The shower promises to be prominent in 1983, because in 1982 60 - 80 Lyrids per hour were observed. On April 27th, the Moon is full. On April 30th around 1:00 a.m. daylight time, you can see the summer triangle: Vega (in Lyra), Altair (in Aquila), and Deneb (in Cygnus) — a favorite navigational aid from Viking times to modern pilots.

These predictions are no nuttier than most of the other psychic predictions, but that hardly constitutes an endorsement! More news of alleged UFO activity in the Soviet Union is featured in the January 4 ENQUIRER. A UFO is supposed to have \"attacked\" Russia's top space launching center. Two California men claim they saw and photographed the UFO which supposedly landed at Edwards Air Force Base for a meeting with then- President Eisenhower on February 21, 1954. Their account and a photo of the object is the subject of a report in the January 11 issue. UFO activity in the vicinity of Childs, Arizona, is discussed in the January 25 issue of the ENQUIRER. A very good article (by former UFO researcher/publisher Pat Huyghe) .on William R. Corliss' \"Sourcebook Project\" appears in the February issue of SCIENCE DIGEST. Corliss has published numerous volumes on all types of odd and unexplained phenomena. Huyghe's article gives details of Corliss' background, as well as his plans for additional volumes. An update on the Cash-Landrum case from Texas appears in the \"Anti- Matter\"/\"UFO Update\" segment of February OMNI. Unfortunately, there is no good news to report on this particular incident. William R. Corliss, mentioned above, has recently brought out his latest hardcover publication, LIGHTNING, AURORAS, NOC- TURNAL LIGHTS, AND RELATED LUMINOUS PHENOMENA. This is the first in a new series of Catalogs which list specific types of anomalies, giving definitions, evaluations, and all known examples. The present volume covers aurora-like phenomena, electrical discharge phenomena, ball lightning, lightning, nocturnal lights, meteor-like phenomena, and marine light displays. A good many of the entries will be of interest to UFO researchers. More than 1,100 examples of such phenomena are presented in the book's 248 pages, along with bibliographies and indexes. The price is $11.95. Order from: The Sourcebook Project, Box 107, Glen Arm, MD 21057. Highly recommended, as are all the Sourcebook publications. Anyone who has read Loren E. Gross' three booklets on pre-1947 UFO activity will be glad to leam that the author's talents as a UFO historian have produced still more highly- readable material. UFOs: A HISTORY, Vol. 1: July 1947-December 1948 is now available in a 160-page, softcover edition from Arcturus Book Service (263 North Ballston Avenue, Scotia, NY 12302) for $12.95 (add 85<F for postage & handling). Gross has compiled this book from Air Force files of the period, as well as newspaper and magazine articles. This is the first of a series of volumes designed to cover the early years of UFO research. There is a considerable amount of new information, as well as fresh examinations of \"classic\" cases. It is a monumental task Gross has undertaken and one which should earn him the thanks of all UFO researchers. A revised edition of Gross' earlier work, THE MYSTERY OF THE GHOST ROCKETS, is also available from Arcturus Book Service ($6.95, paperback, 68 pages). Those who have read the original version will want a copy of this edition also, as it contains new material relating to the strange objects seen over Europe (and elsewhere) in 1946. Anthropoids, Continued UFO/anthropoid cases: 1. A spurious correlation created by unconfirmed rumors, hoaxes and biased media coverage. 2. There is a wide variety of UFO entities and it is only coincidence that some resemble Bigfoot. 3. UFOs are \"studying\" Bigfoot as well as men. 4. Extraterrestrial beings are depositing primitive animals (anthropoids) as part of a planetary biological experiment. 5. UFOs and anthropoids both originate from another \"dimen- sion.\" 6.
