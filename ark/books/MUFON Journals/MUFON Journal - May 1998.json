To explain the time lapse: the primary wit- ness had called his local news- paper the morning following the incident, but because he had placed a work application with a sensitive installation in his area, he would not reveal his identity, and the reporter did not listen to his story. Although he shortly secured a job elsewhere, he kept hoping to be hired for the sensitive job. When, in July, 1997, he saw a story in The Des Moines Reg- ister giving information about MUFON and my phone number, he saved the information. When he finally gave up on being hired at the sensitive installation, he called me and the investigation began. This case raises some interesting questions, but first the facts as reported by the witnesses. The primary witness (whom I will call John), while cutting weeds in a fence row in his side yard, heard a sound overhead-like that of a Volkswagen mo- tor. It was still a full hour before sunset, and as John looked up he watched for about fifteen seconds as a very small ultralight-type craft approached from the northwest at about 200 feet altitude, passing overhead as it moved southeast over his yard. John dropped his trimming tool and waved to what looked like an ap- propriately suited and helmeted pilot. Although the pilot did not wave back, he believes that the pilot was look- ing down at him. Because of surrounding tree foliage, the wit- ness ran out to the street trying to keep the tiny craft in view, and it was then that things began to get very strange. John's view at this point was of his neighbor's house across the street, to the right of which is a small neighborhood park of perhaps one-acre size. As he reached the street, he heard a low sound, somewhat less than the hum emitted by a microwave oven, and was startled to see a flat-ended cylindrical object, tan in color and with a plastic-looking 20'x 20' black \"win- dow\" at its midsection. A part of this object, which the witness estimates at about 100 feet in length and about 20 feet in diameter, was already moving above the park, approaching from the west and headed slowly east on an interception course with the small ultralight \"trike.\" Stunned, John watched for an estimated ten seconds, and then the high strangeness intensified. The trike was now about 200 feet southeast of John's house, and as the cigar-shaped object ap- proached from behind, the top-front one-third of the object opened-like a giant upper jaw-and the pilot and his small craft were taken/swallowed by the cylinder, this procedure taking an estimated five seconds. Dur- ing this \"swallowing/docking\" procedure, there was no sound. (It should be noted that as the UFO ap- proached, John saw the trike rum a bit to the east, and he wonders whether this was the normal course being followed by the pilot or whether this might have been an evasive action by the trike pilot.) As John watched, the UFO proceeded slowly on to a point about 200 feet east of his house, stopped and hovered briefly, then made a sharp right angle turn to its left (north). The witness at this point ran into the house to get his 24-year-old son (whom I will call Ri- chard). By the time Richard came out, the cylinder was now at a higher altitude of around 500 feet, but still only about 250 feet east of the house. Slowly the object began to accelerate and gain altitude as it then moved NNW over Burlington, and in about ten sec- onds it was gone. The object, as it accelerated, seemed to change in color from tan to silver. Even the \"black window\" An ultra-light of the type reported by witness"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 May 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Drawing by witness, \"John.\" area at its midsection seemed to turn silver. But John does not know if the color change was the result^of acceleration, or whether sunlight may have reflected on the metallic surface to create an illusion of silver as the object moved. The whole affair had lasted per- haps 60 seconds. Questions that we as investigators need to ask, even though we have no way of finding answers at this time: Was the \"trike\" actually an ultralight-type craft, or could it have been a probe belonging to the UFO cylindrical object? Was the witness watching an actual mid-air ab- duction, or could this have been some sort of UFO-generated mental manipulation of the witness' perception? These are questions, of course, for which we have no answers. Taken at face value, it would appear that a UFO simply took a small terrestrial craft and its pilot on board. What followed? Who knows? If this was a mid-air abduction, as perceived, did the trike pilot know he was taken? Assuming that he was brought back by the UFO, and if he has no memory of being taken, it would seem that he might be puzzled by a \"missing time\" element. However, reading his fuel gauge would seem to confirm his shorter time in the air (his craft having been on board the UFO), and, al- though he might be left with questions about the inci- dent, he might possibly relegate it to only a minor point of confusion in his mind because of the contradiction involving time and fuel consumption. If, on the other hand, the pilot DID know he was taken, who would he tell? As investigators, we have never been optimistic about obtaining informa- tion directly from the \"abductee pilot\" in this case. Con- tacts with law enforcement agencies and the local air- port have turned up no one reported missing through such an event, and no other witnesses have come for- ward. Whatever the answers to the above questions, larger questions remain: (1) Why did the UFO initiate such an action over a residential area at such close range? (2) Why did the UFO allow the action to be wit- nessed? Based on encounter reports, it would seem that the UFO could have \"switched off' any and all witnesses in the area if it had wished to do so. We are left, of course, with only the witnesses' perception of the incident. Incidentally, John mentioned to investigators that this is the third sighting of a cylin- drical object in the Burlington area that he knows about, and recounted the other two sightings as follows: (1) 15-20 years ago, a cylinder was reported above a local radio station. (2) As reported in the Burlington Hawkeye news- paper a few months before John's sighting, a lady saw a cylinder while driving her car. Are the witnesses credible? At first, John said his son did NOT want to be interviewed, because he is \"shy.\" And when investigators arrived, the son was not present. As the interview progressed beyond in- door questioning, we went outside to examine the area of the sighting, and John re-created his perception of the time frame of the incident. As John ran inside the house, he verbally counted off the seconds it had taken him to get his son to come outdoors to see the UFO. At that point, the son, Richard, actually emerged from the house with his father, and we had our opportunity to interview him."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1998 PageS We also persuaded him to sign the report form, assur- ing him that his name would not be used in public. Richard's concerns, it turned out, were tied to his fear of Men in Black, and whether the government might contact the family. It should be noted at this point that John's wife had also been very reluctant to have him report this incident, and remains adamant to this day that she doesn't want him to publicly reveal his identity. Because John has now approached a Burlington newspaper and given them his identity, he may now have exposed himself locally, but this in no way releases MUFON to publish or expose his son's identity, and therefore John's real name is not being used in this article. John's son, Richard, did seem to be somewhat \"shy\" and a bit hesitant in speaking. And because his father obviously took the lead in recounting the inci- dent, we were concerned that the son might be some- what passive and acquiescent toward his father's ver- sion of events. However, we were glad to see that he did speak up a time or two to correct a minor point in his father's narrative, allowing us to further favorably assess the credibility of both witnesses. Of major concern to us as investigators was the question of whether an ultralight-type craft could fit into a 20-foot diameter cylinder. Investigation on the Internet by Jonathan Long and myself shows pho- tos of \"trikes\" that appear consistent not only with what John describes, but also the sketch he drew in the pres- ence of investigators. John estimates the little craft as about 17 feet in length and about 15 feet wide at the widest part of the V-shaped wingspan. There are some further reasons to believe that we are not being \"scammed.\" Trikes, I am told by a dealer, are much more popular in Europe than in the U.S. and are not common in the state of Iowa among ultralight pilots. John had, a few years ago, attended an ultralight show at the local airport, so if he had speci- fied a commonly seen regular-sized ultralight, he could easily have upped his estimate of the cylinder to 40 feet in diameter so it could accommodate a larger, com- monly seen craft-and we as investigators would not have known the difference. So it seems a point in John's favor that he specified a 20-foot diameter object and a trike, which would not only fit the description he gave us, but also the space available to park it inside the cylinder. Also, John says he waved at the ultralight pi- lot, but that the pilot did not wave back, although he thinks the pilot looked down at him. This may seem a small detail, but John could just as well have told us that the pilot waved back, and we'd not have known the difference. Further, when I sent a written narrative to John and his son, asking them to peruse and make any necessary changes, John made a minor correction, changing \"200 feet from their home\" to \"250 feet from their home.\" Again, this may seem like a minor detail- and it is-but it is significant that he wanted to make even this small correction, although it would have made no difference to the basic narrative. Then, of course, if the witness intended to \"scam\" us, we'd have to ask why he would bother to set the sighting date over a year earlier than his report to us. Why not bring it into a more current time-frame? We believe, at this point in our assessment, that the primary witness and his son are credible. However, as with most any case, the investigation remains open-ended. And if further witnesses or facts emerge, we will certainly pursue the investigation. UFO conferences feature fun, knowledge, fellowship By Dwight Connelly After attending two UFO conferences this spring, I am looking forward to my third such get-to- gether this year-the 1998 MUFON International Sym- posium in Denver June 26-28. There is nothing like meeting with other enthusiasts and interacting with some of the top people in the field, and this type of activity is open to all participants. While formal pre- sentations are usually seen as the main features, the informal contacts are probably the best part. The March 20-22 Sixth Annual Gulf Breeze UFO Conference, sponsored by Project Awareness, featured something for just about everyone. Dr. Scott Mandelker talked about \"ET Souls on Earth,\" Forest Crawford told about his experiences with the \"Oscar\" contactee case, Dr. David Jacobs and Budd Hopkins brought attendees up to date on abduction cases, Jim Marrs discussed the \"alien agenda,\" Donald Ware sum- marized ten years of Gulf Breeze sightings, Jaime Maussan showed videos of UFOs in Mexico, Linda Moulton Howe updated her latest book on \"High Strangeness\" cases, and Bill Hamilton lectured on re- verse engineering alien technology. It was a chance to renew acquaintances, meet new people, and bounce ideas around with some of the leaders of ufology. The tenth annual April 10-12 Ozark UFO Con- ference at Eureka Springs, AR, directed by Lou Parish, is almost like a family reunion, with some of the speak- ers, such as Linda Moulton Howe, invited back every year. Other speakers, included Lloyd Pye on \"Every- thing You Know is Wrong,\" Joe Lewels on \"Angels or Aliens?\" Jim Marrs on the \"alien agenda,\" Jeanne Robinson on the experience of being an abductee, and Nancy Talbott on physical evidence related to crop circles and animal deaths.

By Donna Bahor I had gone to an abduction conference, and while there met a fellow abductee. The conference was over and people were starting to leave. I sat down with this fellow abductee and chatted. Then all of a sudden I heard this buzz in my head. I told her that I heard the buzz and her reply was, \"Who's there?\" We both started laughing. Thirty years ago, when I first started receiving the buzzes as a child, I wasn't laughing. How do I make people understand? The buzz sounds drove me up a wall then. Later I started driving my parents up a wall because I kept constantly complaining about those buzzes in my head. The buzz sounds in my head began after an abduction, but for some reason I never thought the two were related. At least that's what I thought at first. Even- tually my parents took me to an eyes, ears, and nose doctor. My parents had had enough of my complaining and I would learn some harsh lessons. I was taken to this doctor to have my ears checked for a cause to the buzz sounds in my head. He checked my ears, and then stood in front of me. I'm not sure what happemed next, but I think he checked my nose. What I do know for sure is that a very small pewter colored cylinder fell into his right hand. He said, \"Where did this come from?\" I had an awful feeling where the object had come from and how it got there. The doctor then threw the object in the waste basket. When the doctor was done with his examina- tion, he told my parents that he could find no cause for the buzz sounds in my head and that I was making it up. I was hurt. I knew what I was experiencing. The buzz sounds stopped for about a week. I was abducted again. This time they put something behind my right ear. The buzzes in my head began again. This time 1 said nothing. I had learned my lesson. For probably a month afterward I was bleeding behind my right ear. I was trying to dig out whatever was there with my nails. After a while I gave up and accepted the fact that what- ever was in my head was going to stay there. Even though the buzzes persisted, I learned to ignore them. A few years ago I learned that I wasn't the only one who received these buzz sounds. Someone sug- gested that we write down when we hear the buzz sounds and compare times. Well, I wrote down when and how long the buzzes lasted. The problem was that I would never see that person again. Now, what do I do? I decided to watch when I received the buzz sounds. About the author Mrs. Bahor, 44, who lives in Ohio and has completed two years of college, reports that she has had a significant number of interactions with UFOs. For awhile I thought I had solved this mystery. But then maybe I had only part of the mystery solved. Patterns began to form. If I received a buzz at night, the next day I would receive something in the mail pertaining to UFOs, like The MUFON UFO Journal. One day I got a buzz in the morning, so I thought that I might receive a phone call from an ab- duction group. Indeed, I got a phone call from an ab- duction group. Sometimes in the day I would have pain in my chest. My immediate concern was my heart. Later that day I would receive a buzz. One time my stomach was bothering me. Later I received a buzz. I was fine. As far as I know I am in perfect health. One day I was on the phone with someone dis- cussing UFOs when I got a buzz. I asked the person if he had heard the buzz. He told me he heard buzzes all the time. I then asked him if he checked his body for marks. He told me he had them. He was an experiencer. This was weird. At first I thought all buzz sounds were the same. Boy, was I wrong. My buzz sounds like an BBS signal. I learned that some abductees hear tones, while others hear hums. Still others hear something else. Perhaps there are no two buzzes alike. In conclusion, do I have any definite answers? Maybe not. What I do have is something that should be looked at more closely. In order to learn the truth, one must start somewhere. Maybe this is one such place. BUZZ, BUZZ, WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME? Editor's Note: If other abductees have com- ments on this article, I'd like to hear from them. Also, George Filer, MUFON's Eastern direc- tor, reports that a Dr. R. Leir and a Derrel Sims dem- onstrated in a meeting at Thousand Oaks, CA, that markings on abductees which are not normally visible can show up under a \"black light\" (the kind used at Halloween parties, etc.). They report that the light shows what appear to be fluorescent markings, green- ish in color and not easily washed off. They report- edly last from one hour to perhaps ten days, according to Leir and Sims. A variation, reported in regard to women who had held hybrid babies, was red fluores- cent markings where the babies contacted their bod- ies. The suggestion at the meeting was that abductees keep a black light handy and check frequently for the markings. If anyone has any information on this, pro or con, let me know."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1998 Page? Anthony Constantino Using hypnosis as an investigative tool By Anthony 0. Constantino A s a \"lay consultant in hypnosis\" volunteer for MUFON, I would like to explain briefly the nature of hypnosis and its role as an investiga- tive tool to help \"alleged\" UFO abductees recall their experiences. Hypnosis is a normal, natural state of relax- ation in which a willing subject is able to accept sug- gestions from a hypnotist. The suggestions must relate to the concern for which the subject originally sought the services of the hypnotist, and they must conform to the subject's moral and ethi- cal paradigm. To explain this phe- nomenon to potential clients and to students who take my course in hypnosis at our lo- cal community college, I use a \"flashlight analogy.\" Sleeping When a subject is sleeping, his \"consciousness switch\" is OFF, and he does not interact with his envi- ronment; thus, there is no light beam. Normally, he will remain in this state until his body arouses him when his need for sleep has been satisfied, or until his alarm clock awakens him. During sleep, hopefully, a built-in safety mea- sure will awaken him to respond to a variety of emer- gencies: bathroom, smoke alarm, crying baby, etc. Ob- jective tests (i.e., galvanic skin response, respiration, EEG, metabolism) can identify this state arid its depth at any given time. Meditating When a subject is meditating, his \"conscious- ness switch\" is ON, so he is consciously aware of his surroundings, yet he does not interact with his envi- ronment; thus, there is no light beam. Think of medita- tion as \"suspended consciousness,\" or \"suspended thinking.\" To achieve this state, the subject uses any number of meditation techniques to still his mind, in- cluding counting or repeating a \"mantra\" (objective word). This state can also be objectively measured. From \"Physiological Effects of Transcenden- tal Meditation,\" by Dr. R. K. Wallace, Science, Vol. 167, No. 3926, 1970: \"...oxygen consumption, heart rate, skin resistance, and EEG were recorded before, during, and after subjects practiced...transcendental meditation. There were significant changes between the control period and the meditation period in all measurements...Physiologically, the state produced by TM seems to be distinct from commonly encountered states of consciousness, such as wakefulness, sleep, and dreaming, and from altered states of conscious- ness, such as hypnosis and auto-suggestion.\" (bold face is mine.) Consciousness During consciousness the \"consciousness switch\" is ON, and the subject interacts with his envi- ronment with a variety of sights, smells, sounds, tastes, and touches. Note the \"shotgun\" effect of the light beam. Indeed, that is the problem. Too many stimuli impinge upon his consciousness, so he must select those to which he will give his attention. Sometimes he will quiet some senses to in- crease the sensitivity of another, as when he averts his eyes and cocks his head to hear better, or when he closes his eyes and shuts out noise to better visualize how to position more accurately that nut or bolt in that hard-to-reach place. This state is verifiable by obser- vation and also by objective measurement. Hypnosis During hypnosis the \"consciousness switch\" is ON, but now the subject's interaction with his envi- ronment is focused into a single beam-as powerful to the conscious and unconscious as the single focused beam of a laser. Here the subject has agreed with the hypnotist to limit incoming stimuli ONLY to the hypnotist's voice, and to limit his projection into the environment only to the hypnotist. Here is the important point: there are NO ob- jective, measurable tests which can determine a differ- ence between the conscious state and the hypnotic state. Sleep and meditation are different states of conscious- ness with objective measurements which show differ- ences between them and consciousness; hypnosis is an altered state of consciousness. While direct suggestion can elicit physiologi- cal changes to the subject, the hypnosis per se causes NO objective, measurable physiological differences which would distinguish it from consciousness. Except for profound relaxation and concentration, conscious- ness and hypnosis are essentially the same state of mind! Subject knows everything Understand that under hypnosis the subject knows everything that is occurring-whether a tooth is being drilled or an appendix removed without benefit of anaesthesia. The subject does NOT \"black out,\" retains control at all times, can open his eyes, and can end the session any time he chooses. He can, and will, remember everything that was said and done; any sug- gestion to the contrary will wear off in a few days. He"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS May 1998 MUFON UFO Journal can, and probably will, react emotionally to whatever memories are uncovered. No one-not I, not the most profound scientist- can explain how hypnosis works. Apparently, in a state of deep relaxation, it becomes easier-no guarantees, just easier-to recall memories long forgotten or re- pressed. Two types of recall There are two types of recall: \"pseudo-regres- sion\" means that the subject is remembering what oc- curred. This is determined by noting that the subject speaks in the past tense: \"He sat to my left.\" \"True regression\" means that the subject is re- living what occurred. This is determined by noting that he speaks in the present tense: \"He's sitting to my left.\" The subject's body may also correspond to his state- ment, such as his head turning to the left or his arm pointing in that direction. Experience tells me it is NOT possible to \"lead\" a subject into believing something is true that is not true. When working with abductees, I've rephrased questions to find inconsistent answers and uncovered none. I've rephrased questions with misinformation only to have subjects correct me. (\"Is that the alien you like?\" \"No,\" with some impatience, \"that's the one I don't like!\") Confabulation There is a phenomenon in hypnosis called \"confabulation.\" If the hypnotist persists and pressures with a particular question, the subject might fill in gaps with what he thinks is the answer, and not with what he knows is the answer. It's not deliberate lying; it's an effort to relieve the pressure the subject might be feel- ing from the hypnotist. Any competent hypnotist knows this and refrains from anything that might elicit con- fabulation. My work with UFO abductees is open to scru- tiny to anyone who reads TheAllagash Abductions by Ray Fowler, since it is I who worked with him and the four abductees chronicled in that book. My work also constitutes the last third of The Watchers, also by Ray Fowler. Hopefully, this brief article will put into per- spective the controversy that careful and qualified hyp- notists are causing UFO abductees to \"invent\" their experiences by \"leading\" them. More constructive would be efforts marshalled to help determine what is being done to these abductees, why it's being done, and then to help them adjust and cope with that knowl- edge.

Dr. Mark Carlotto, one of those who strongly felt that 1976 Vi- king images suggested something had been constructed on the Red Planet, now says that it is possible that the face is a feature of geology. He adds, however, that some features, such as a uniform \"beveled edge headdress\" encircling the face, still suggest artificiality. Other factors which continue to give hope to those who had argued that the face was not natural include a poor camera angle and haze which limited image resolution. Professor Stanley McDaniel, co-founder and spokesperson for the Society for Planetary SETI Re- search (SPSR), editor and one of the authors of A Case for the Face, and a former critic of NASA's lack of interest in the Cydonian region, praised NASA for its cooperation in targeting this area. Dr. McDaniel, who will be a speaker at this year's MUFON International Symposium in Denver, has indicated disappointment in the initial images, but says that no single image will answer the question, since there are \"more than two dozen\" formations that indicate a high probability that they are not natural. SPSR scientists had previously concluded that the chances were at least a thousand to one in favor of the Cydonia region containing artificial structures. Dr. Tom Van Flandern, one of the authors of The Case for the Face, took a more positive view of the early images. He says the features of the face were actually confirmed by the new photo, \"despite poor lighting and poor viewing angle,\" pointing specifically to the \"headdress\" and other linear and rounded fea- tures. Van Flandem concludes that \"nothing yet seen on our moon or any other solar system surface besides Earth suggests artificiality to a comparable degree.\" Interest remains high in that portion of Cydonia dubbed \"the city,\" since this is the area which research- ers say has the most promise of artificiality. The April 14 image missed the targeted area of \"the City\" by about 1.5 kilometers and showed nothing of real inter- est. The next imaging attempt, set for April 23, (which had not been completed at this writing) was supposed to again target \"the city.\" Whether there will be additional attempts to secure high-resolution images of the Cydonia region after April 23 is unknown at this point. Book review The Case for the Face Edited by Professor Stanley V. McDaniel and Monica Rix Paxson, Brandenburg. Adventures Unlim- ited Press, Kempton, IL 60946. March, 1998. 6x9 pa- perback, $17.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Issued in March, this fine book received a dam- aging blow from events only a month later. Written to justify a closer look at possibly artificial structures in the Cydonia region of Mars, the desired closer look provided in April seemed to make this hypothesis less likely (see story elsewhere on this page). While the evidence for the \"face\" and other \"structures\" being artificial has not disappeared, it has certainly lessened. In a way it's a shame The Case for the Face was not published months earlier. The recent images will undoubtedly hurt readership, and the 20 scientists who contributed interesting, informative articles to this book deserve a wider readership than they are likely to have. This story actually begins when NASA sent two spaceships to Mars in 1976 at a cost of more than $2 billion. While the two landers found no definitive signs of life, the orbiting spacecraft sent back a total of 51,539 images over a period of about four years. How- ever, only about one-fourth of these have been ana- lyzed, due to lack of funding. Of the images that were published, one show- ing what appeared to be a \"face\" in the Cydonia area caught the interest of some scientists. NASA, how- ever, came up with a second image and announced that the face was only an ordinary hill. Later, aerospace researchers Vincent DiPietro and Gregory Molenaar utilized their newly-developed Starburst Pixel Interleaving Technique (SPIT) on the first image, and the results seemed to indicate an artifi- cial structure. NASA was unable to provide a copy of the second image (\"misfiled\"), but the researchers eventually found eight other images which seemed to indicate the face was artificial. An opportunity for ad- ditional images was missed when the Mars Observer spacecraft was lost in 1993, supposedly due to an ex- plosion just prior to arriving on Mars. During the past few months, interested scien- tists, including Professor Stanley V. McDaniel, worked very hard to convince NASA to utilize the Global Sur- veyor to map the Cydonia area again in April of this year. The arguments presented by scientists in this book seemed to have an influence on NASA's deci- sion to take another look at that area.

In the first four articles I commented that, unlike the U.S. and elsewhere, UFO abduction accounts had not really hit the mainstream mass media here in Australia. However, the past three years finally saw the mass media's attention drawn to the subject of UFO abductions. Central to this has been a number of factors. First, the largest number of UFO books ever to have been pub- lished in Australia in a 12- month period hit the shelves. The first Australian book writ- ten by a local abduction experiencer appeared in 1996. Titled Encounter, and authored by a Victorian woman, Kelly Cahill, it related her own experiences, plus some of the details of the subsequent investiga- tion by John Auchettl of Melbourne. Auchettl reported that he had uncovered and interviewed the three mem- bers of a second, independent party to the events that Cahill related. Later, details about a sixth person emerged, also placing him at the site. Encounter received widespread publicity in a variety of high profile commercial magazines. In addi- tion, an associated publicity tour involved a large num- ber of radio, TV, and lecture appearances for Cahill. Also in 1996, well-known researcher Bill Chalker's book, The Oz Files, hit the scene, including a first chap- ter presentation of the Cahill event. In publicising his work, Chalker undertook numerous media appearances. My own work, UFOs: A Report on Australian Encounters, appeared in May of 1997. In it, among other things, I reported details of a range of Australian abduction cases from over the years. I also presented my then current views on the nature of the abduction phenomenon. As with Cahill and Chalker, the book release was accompanied by high profile publicity. Secondly, two international UFO symposiums added to the information flow. Thanks to the marvel- lous efforts of Glennys Mackay and associates, of Brisbane, these events showcased a multitude of top level Australian and overseas speakers. Abduction re- About the Author Keith Basterfield, a field investigator for MUFON, was formerly MUFON Continental Co-ordinator for Australia. search and experiences rated highly on the agenda, with talks by John Mack, Whitley Strieber, John Carpenter, and myself, among others. All added their personal viewpoints on the abduction phenomenon. Thirdly, the participants of the March 1996 Casino (New South Wales) case went public, appear- ing on a number of mainstream electronic media out- lets. The total publicity surrounding the release of the three books and the Casino case exceeded by far the previous exposure given to the abduction subject in Australia. Media interest finally waned this spring. As regards cases, two events dominated the period 1995-1997, These were the Belgrave (Cahill) case and the Casino (New South Wales) episode. In the Belgrave incident it is reported that six people in three separate vehicles, independent of each other, were present at a location just outside of Melbourne, Victoria, in August of 1993. They were involved in a close encounter, with some of them re- membering an abduction. Details of the case, as then known, were documented in two articles by this au- thor in the MUFON UFO Journal. Since that article, some details of the second party's recollections have appeared in CahilFs book, which also featured partial results of Auchettl's inspec- tion of physical traces from the site. The British UFO Magazine published the partial contents of a letter from the wife of the sixth person. Despite the inability of other researchers to independently interview the sec- ond party, or for any researcher to interview the third party, as well as the lack of peer review of Auchettl's field data, the case appears an important one. A classic \"missing time\" event, which under hypnosis turned into a classic abduction, is reported to have occurred on the night of March 16, 1996, near Casino, New South Wales. Two adults, travelling with their children, reported observing unusual lights and experiencing a period of missing time on a trip between Lismore and Grafton. Regression hypnosis revealed that their vehicle had been stopped by a UFO, and the family abducted and taken onboard, where medical examinations were conducted. The family members were then returned to their vehicle. A large number of unusual side effects were noted. The type of abduction event being reported in this country continues to vary from \"missing time\" to \"full blown\"'abduction. However, I note that many of the more recently reported episodes are likely to fea- ture fewer elements of a full blown abduction. These cases are heavy on \"missing time,\" or \"dreams\" that"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1998 Page 11 an abduction occurred. One example came to me from a 35-year-old woman who recalled mysterious dreams of seeing UFOs, which included nightmares of seeing ape-like figures. However, she was unaware of any other fac- tors which might indicate an abduction had occurred. Another was from the girlfriend of a man who normally walked between work and home in 40 min- utes, but who on one occasion took twice this length of time, but couldn't explain to her why he was late. Although there was no other indicator, she believed he had been abducted. Quite a few of these \"dream\" abductions are emerging from non-traditional health sessions, for ex- ample myofacial massage. Episodes originating in moving motor vehicles are relatively few and far be- tween. Most, in fact, are bedroom intrusions. What types of entities are being reported? Pre- viously, most Australian experiences were describing the classic North American gray, but of late there have been accounts of a \"praying mantis\" and even \"reptil- ians.\" However, the grays continue to dominate de- scriptions. One item of the North American abduction scene which has not been reported here, to the best of my knowledge, is the involvement of \"military\" fig- ures in abductions. What of Australian research into the phenom- enon during these years? Regretfully, little in the way of research appears to have been undertaken, and, if undertaken, not been published by the major UFO groups during the period under review. The author undertook a small scale question- naire survey of Australian abductions, looking specifi- cally at the reported after-effects. At a meeting on June 23, 1996, 130 copies of the survey questionnaire were distributed in Melbourne, and with Volume 3 Number 3 of the newsletter of the Australian UFO Abduction Study Centre, and 54 completed questionnaires were received back, a return rate of 41%. Using the Centre for UFO Studies' (Rodeghier et al 1991) definition of an abduction which is (in abbreviated form): \"A witness must be taken against his or her will from normal, terrestrial surroundings by non-human beings ... to another enclosed space ... assumed by the witness to be a spacecraft... subjected to various pro- cedures ... remembered consciously or through vari- ous means ... such as hypnosis.\" Let's list the statements where more than two thirds of respondents agreed in the affirmative: \"I have begun to channel information from some other source\" (78%) \"I have had an increase in the number of dreams 1 recall (70%) \"I feel I receive information somehow from elsewhere\" (92%) \"1 feel I am more psychic than before\" (89%) \"I read more books about UFOs\" (70%) \"I experience strange flows of energy through my body\" (83%) \"I sometimes get flashbacks to my experience\" (79%) \"My intuition has increased\" (96%) \"I often know things are going to happen before they do\" (90%). Statements about life changes where there was an increase greater than or equal to 4.0 (scale of 0-5) were: \"Concern for spiritual matters\" (4.0) \"Desire to achieve a higher consciousness\"(4.6) \"Belief in a higher power\" (4.3) \"Interest in the possibility of extra-terrestrial life\" (4.7) \"Feel I have a task to per- form\" (4.3) \"Feel that major changes will occur to Earth\" (4.3) \"Feel I have been chosen\" (4.0) \"Appre- ciation of nature\" (4.1) I also prepared, in late 1997, an updated ver- sion of \"An Australian and New Zealand abduction and apparent abduction catalogue.\" This catalogue is available on the Internet at the following address: http/ /www.iufog.org/project 1947/kbabduct.htm. I established the national level Australian UFO Abduction Study Centre, a time limited research project, in May of 1994 with a number of aims. By June of 1997, having met these aims, it closed. During that period, some 150 persons inquired on the Centre's hotline about being potential experiencers. These were referred to the appropriate state level UFO and sup- port groups for follow-up. Twelve issues of a network- ing newsletter were published by the Centre, and dis- tributed to health professionals, UFO researchers, and experiencers in this country. In order to collate and compare Australian ab- duction experiences, I called on a number of occasions for a national level database to be established. How- ever, UFO research and experiencer support groups have not seen the need for such a research tool. Although the past three years have brought the presence of some high profile experiencers, most indi- viduals prefer anonymity. For the latter, a number of experiencer support groups continue to provide an es- sential service to those coming forward. Such groups exist in Brisbane (Queensland), Sydney (New South Wales), Melbourne (Victoria) and Perth (Western Aus- tralia.) All provide both one on one, and group sup- port. \"Where have all the good old fashioned UFO cases gone?\" is one of the laments I continue to hear. One of the tasks I have undertaken for many years, since 1978 actually, is the compilation of national level UFO sightings. Although many hundreds of raw UFO reports are received by the more than 30 UFO groups in the country, only a relatively small percentage re- mains unidentified after rational research. Precise fig- ures are hard to come by, but my feeling, after talking to researchers around the land, is that abduction cases have indeed replaced good old physical trace events"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 May 1998 MUFON UFO Journal as the \"core phenomenon\" being reported. In conclusion, the abduction phenomenon is now well set into the minds of Australians. We read about it in popular magazines, and are exposed to it on television and radio. It has even made its way into ad- vertisements. On the downside, as in the United States and England, it is now hard to find someone who is naive about the subject of abduction experiences-mak- ing life much more difficult for researchers. For good or bad, the UFO abduction experience has truly ar- rived in the Australian psyche. References: Basterfield, Keith. (1997) UFOs: A report on Australian encounters. Kew. Reed. Cahill, Kelly.

Likewise, the technique called shape-from-shading (photoclinometry) is also explained. Specific objects in Cydonia, such as the Tholus (two sets of grooves?), the D&M Pyramid (a runnel leading into it?), a cluster of large formations called \"the city\" and \"the fort\" (isosceles triangles matching those in the cross-section of a tetrahedron, and other geometric patterns) indicated something other than natural formations. It was calculated by computer, in fact, that the pentad formation of five mounds had less than one chance in 200 million of being random. Regardless of one's opinion concerning \"the face\" or other areas of Cydonia, this is an important book that shows how a group of scientists developed the evidence from what was available to them, with- stood the criticism that would inevitably come from such a project, and convinced NASA that Cydonia was at least worth another look. Whether their preliminary hypothesis proves to be correct or incorrect, we owe them a great deal of respect and gratitude for pursuing this project. We have undoubtedly learned much more about Mars from their efforts than otherwise would have been the case. Study finds increase in Canadian UFOs A recent study by a national research group has found that the skies over Canada are getting more crowded-with UFOs. \"We were surprised to leam there were so many reports last year,\" said astronomer Chris Rutkowski, research coordinator for Ufology Research of Manitoba (UFOROM), which collects and studies UFO reports in Canada. \"There were 284 UFO sightings reported in Canada in 1997, up about 10 per cent from 1996.\" Last year's cases ranged from a group of people chased by a flying saucer near Tuktoyaktuk to a giant boomerang buzzing a 20-year Coast Guard veteran in Sault Ste. Marie. Rutkowski said sightings reported to researchers and UFO groups from BC to the Maritimes were collected by UFOROM and added to a database for statistical analyses. Among the findings: Most UFOs were reported in British Colum- bia (35%) and Ontario (25%). UFOs were seen in winter as likely as sum- mer; no national monthly trend was found. Almost three-quarters of all UFOs are seen at night, and most of these around 11 p.m. Most UFOs are watched for a long time; the average length of observation was 20 minutes. UFOs are witnessed by more than one person at a time; most cases have two witnesses. The typical Hollywood-style flying saucer shaped UFOs are now less common than triangular ones. Only 4.6 % of all the UFO reports were la- belled \"higher-quality unknowns\"; most UFO sightings were either misidentifications of things such as planes or planets, or the reports didn't have enough informa- tion to reach a conclusion. \"None of these unknowns prove there are aliens out there,\" Rutkowski said, \"but we are left with some cases which investigators cannot explain.\" For regional information, contact: UFO*BC at 604-432-4113, MUFON Ontario at 416-532-9371, SOS OVNI (Quebec) at 514-536-0140 MUFON Nova Scotia at 902-832-1984.

Calamia One of the classic UFO cases took place on April 24, 1964, at Socorro, NM, witnessed by Lonnie Zamora, a Socorro policeman. At the time of the Socorro incident I was 17 years old. I had the opportu- nity to visit the landing site one or two weeks after the occurrence, and recall viewing remnants of the charred brush and fading scorch marks. This site became the \"holy grail\" to my own interests and experiences on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. As time passed, interest in the case stagnated, physical evidence vanished with the desert winds, and new cases caught our attention. Socorro became only a passing thought for everyone. That is, everyone ex- cept Lonnie Zamora! Mr. Zamora's existence changed, simply because he was the officer on duty who just happened to be in \"hot-pursuit\" of a speeding motorist on that April day so long ago. He unwillingly was given the starring role in a fantastic real-life drama that would change his life for- ever. I, too, had never forgotten this sighting, and in March I was finally able to talk with Mr. Zamora about this event and its effects on him. Dionicio Zamora (Lonnie's true name) was born Sept. 7,1933, in Magdalena, NM, to the parental union of Domingo Zamora, and the former Rafalita Gomez. The Zamora family moved to Socorro when Lonnie was approximately 10 years of age. One of nine children, his formative years were harsh, and there was little or no time for the niceties of life. Lonnie said he joined the New Mexico Na- tional Guard at age 17, serving for 24 years. Although, Lonnie never saw combat, he was called upon to help suppress prison riots in the 80's. He recalls joining the Socorro Police Department at age 18 in 1951 as a part-time officer. At age 21, he became a full time police officer, covering the full gamut of problems within a small com- munity, including bar-room brawls, domestic disputes, and tragic automobile accidents. He was no stranger to trauma. On April 24, 1964, he was a 31-year-old policeman with more than ten years of field experi- ence. On that day, his experience and perceptions would be put to the ultimate test. Zamora stated that he had never had any prior interest, knowledge, or understanding of UFOs until the day of the occurrence, noting that he did not re- member even hearing the word until the incident. Re- calling the experience, he said, \"My partner, a part-time Lonnie Zamora officer, wanted to go home early to eat supper with his wife,\" so Zamora dropped his partner off and went to speak with someone. Suddenly he saw a speeding car. It was the pursuit of that car that led to the sighting at approximately 5:45 p.m. Lonnie stated that he saw a blue flame in the desert area, and a dust cloud rise into the air. He ini- tially thought that some type of crash had occurred, and therefore immediately stopped the hot-pursuit and drove off into the desert area to investigate. Zamora stated that as he drove up to the area he noticed a white object in the ravine near an old dynamite shack. He said he thought the object was an overturned car or truck. Lonnie stated that he never actually saw any creatures. He said he did see two objects that appeared to be white overalls in the immediate proximity of the craft, but the figures were indiscernible at the distance that he first observed the scene. He said that they must have been there (near the ship) because of the foot- prints that were later located. He said he soon became aware of the fact that the white object on the desert floor was not an over- turned car or truck. Zamora stated that he was on the air with his dispatcher as he drove up to the scene, but the police radio soon quit, as did the car engine. He recalled that the radio had to be fixed later, but he was"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 May 1998 MUFON UFO Journal able to start the car after the departure of the unknown craft. Lonnie said he recalls hearing a \"sliding noise\" of doors or windows prior to the object's departure, .and that he was alone in that area for about 30 minutes before the arrival of his colleagues. Zamora kindly drew a picture of the craft as seen from his vantage point. He also drew the insignia which he observed on the craft (see sketch), and was adamant that the insignia was black in color and showed well against the white background of the craft. Asked his opinion of what the craft was, he replied, \"I really can't tell you, but I know it wasn't from here. It was not from here. They (Government) were not that advanced at that time. I don't think so. Maybe they were, but I don't think so.\" Zamora stated that he would not report such a thing again. In fact, he admitted that he really did not wish to make the report of the sighting, but after con- ferring with his supervisor it was decided that a report must be filed. Lonnie stated he could see and smell the landing area, which was still smoking after the depar- ture of the craft. A large rock which had been directly underneath the craft had actually been melted in two. Lonnie reported that, shortly thereafter, an Air Force officer had walked down to the landing site with a geiger counter in hand. Lonnie clearly remembers that the needle to the geiger counter sliced into the red-zone, but slowly dissipated after more time had passed. Zamora recalls asking the officer if radiation was present, but the officer told him there was none. Lonnie recalls that he was up the entire night of the incident filling out reports and answering a bar- rage of questions from numerous law enforcement and government agencies. He was interviewed by the State Police, FBI, Military Intelligence, and Chief Investi- gator for Project Blue Book Maj. Hector Quintanilla. Additional interviews were held with newspaper re- porters and representatives of UFO organizations. Lonnie recalls that his household was deluged with telephone calls from almost everywhere imagin- able. Many of the calls were of a harassing nature, and caused Lonnie, his wife, and two children a great deal of grief. Zamora recalls the numerous interviews with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, and spoke very highly of him. Ap- parently Mr. Zamora maintains contact with some of the individuals who became involved in this unwanted drama. Zamora stated that he has never commercial- ized on this incident. Although he once acted as an advisor for a film on the subject, he quickly told the producer that he did not have time for such things, and needed to return to his work. Lonnie told me that he had recurring nightmares in which he would awake in the middle of the night in a wet sweat. These dreams Symbol observed by Lonnie Zamora in 1964. lasted about two weeks after the incident. The dreams ceased, but he candidly admits that he fears \"it\" will return some day. This fear remains ingrained in him. He said he was initially troubled by the entire situation and sought assistance from his priest, conferring with his priest for several months after his exposure to the UFO. As to why he was involved in this event, he says, \"I don't know. It happened to me, so that's what God wanted forme to see.\" Lonnie is (at this writing) 64 years of age, and appears to be in basically good health. However, he contends that he has developed a \"tingling sensation\" on his left side which runs around his back area and down into his right leg. He has had numerous medical exams, including an MRI, but there is nothing to sub- stantiate any specific physical ailment. Zamora seems to believe that this condition becomes more prevalent when he is faced with stressful situations or anxieties. Lonnie continued his employment as a police officer for about two years after the UFO occurrence. He decided to leave the force and found employment elsewhere. Zamora continues to work every day, and seems to be content in his life-style. He appears to be a hard working ultra-conservative realist who has no time for science fiction novels or Star-Wars movies. In fact, I doubt seriously if Mr. Zamora ever saw Star Wars. He is a man of tangible realities who believes in what he can see, touch, smell, and hear. I believe that Lonnie Zamora told the truth, and nothing but the truth, de- spite the fears, uncertainties, and ridicule of the time."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1998 Page 15 Picking Up the Gauntlet A Response to The Threat, a book by David Jacobs, Ph.D. By Joe Lewels, Ph.D. There are so few scholars in the world today who are studying the alien abduction phenomenon that one would think they would eagerly embrace one an- other, like survivors of a shipwreck on a deserted is- land. When I entered this exclusive club, I truly be- lieved that it would be that way. Abduction research- ers live a lonely life in an academic and scientific com- munity that turns its collective nose up at them and scoffs at the mention of the subject. The few researchers, I imagined, must all be close friends, eager to share their knowledge and in- sights and to seek out new ideas in their efforts to solve this bizarre and complex mystery. I thought that it would be as obvious to them, as it was to me, that what is needed is a radical new way of thinking to deal with a phenomenon that seems to emanate from a strange new reality, and which has eluded science for so long. I believed that no one mind or way of thinking could possibly be sufficient to truly understand what it was all about. Different views I realized that there were different views among the major researchers. There were those deeply grounded in accepted scientific principles and meth- odology. (God knows we need them to help us dis- cover the who, what, when, where and how of the alien agenda.) But I also believed that we needed those whose ideas, theories, and techniques were beyond the current scope of science to help us discover the \"why\" of the mystery. We needed people with innovative ideas and revolutionary theories to counterbalance those of the traditional researcher. Some of these original thinkers, although un- orthodox by current standards, could be the ones to find new avenues of approach or to stumble upon some breakthrough, as is often the case with scientific in- quiry. Because this has been proved time and time again in history, I believed that those in the research commu- nity would respect one another's work and gladly learn from each other, while at the same time forming a sort of united front against criticism from outside. But, I guess I was wrong. David Jacobs has thrown down the gauntlet to most other abduction researchers in his current book, The Threat, and he has unfairly singled out perhaps the most prestigious member of the research conununity, Dr. John Mack, for a special scolding. Rather than embracing his fellow researchers, he has About the Author Joe Lewels is MUFON assistant state direc- tor for West Texas and Southern New Mexico, and a MUFON consultant in communications. For the past four years he and psychiatrist Dr. Roberta Fennig of El Paso have conducted an investigation into alien abduction cases in the Southwest. His conclusions were published in his book, The God Hypothesis: Extraterrestrial Life and Its Implications for Science and Religion (Wildflower Press, 1997). resorted to name calling. Those who do not meet his personal standards of research, or who don't agree with his interpretation of the facts, are incompetent New Age Positives who \"band together into almost cultlike groups.\" In Jacobs' view, these researchers have turned UFO research into a religion and have seriously strayed from accepted scientific standards. The result, in his view, is that they have wrongly reached the conclusion that alien abductions are not so bad, and, in some cases, that they can even be positive. He, on the other hand, due to his \"correct\" methodology, knows the real truth- that alien hybrids are secretly plotting to take over the earth, and, due to their superior intellect, usurp control from their human counterparts. For Jacobs, the abduction mystery has been solved, and the solution is quite negative. (He refrains from calling himself and his approved researchers \"The Negatives,\" however.) \"In my most recent research,\" he states, \"I have uncovered information that allows UFO researchers to solve the UFO mystery-at least the questions that will have the greatest impact upon us.\" (p.20) Jacobs has seriously deluded himself in thinking that he has solved the alien abduction mys- tery. It is a delusion that results from his overly nar- row perspective, and from the illusion that he has ac- cess to, and is accounting for, all the data. Jacobs is a \"scientific materialist\" who is trying to solve a mys- tery emanating from the future with science from the past. He seems to have made no effort to grasp the concepts of quantum physics and its implications for the non-local nature of consciousness. Other phenomena He cannot accept that there are out-of-body experiences, past life memories, or other paranormal phenomena that have yet to be explained or accounted for by mainstream researchers. These things are sim- ply \"New Age\" foolishness that do not merit serious thought. Yet it is interesting that he accepts as a matter of fact that aliens communicate telepathically, that they exercise psychic powers, that they walk through walls, and that they sometimes render themselves"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 Mav 1998 MUFON UFO Journal \"unseeable.\" Yet channeling, to Jacobs, is hogwash. He does not recognize that channeling may simply be telepathic communication from a distance. (I find it hard to understand how one can accept the first, but not the second.) Clearly, the UFO mystery is based on science that is hundreds or thousands or even millions of years ahead of ours. Some breakthroughs True, we are beginning to get an idea, through breakthroughs in quantum physics, genetics, and other sciences, as to how some of the amazing \"miracles\" that aliens perform might be done. But the evidence coming from abduction research should teach us that there is much more to learn, and that what we call \"modern science,\" based on \"scientific methodology,\" is sorely inadequate for penetrating even the outer fringes of this mystery. What has happened to Jacobs is that he has gone as far as is possible with the \"Model T\" science to which he is limited. Without engaging in strenuous consciousness raising exercises, he will go no further. In my book, The God Hypothesis, I argue for the need for a much broader approach to UFO research, one that includes the acknowledgement that this is an an- cient phenomenon which very likely was involved in human evolution from the very beginning. What Jacobs sees as an alien invasion may, from another level, be seen merely as evolution in progress. If the human race is ultimately replaced by a more modem, up-to-date model that is more psychic and connected to the Earth, then so be it. It will be our failure to nurture our planet that caused our own down- fall. But is that so different from what happened to Neanderthal man and Cro Magnon man? Missing links Scientists cannot account for how Homo Sapi- ens evolved and yet coexisted with other human \"pro- totypes\" at the same time. What if we humans are the result of the last great jump in evolution created by these beings? What if, due to genetic intervention by superior beings, we humans took over the Earth from those with lesser mental powers? Is this acceptable, while the current situation is not? If this is in fact the case, then maybe \"alien\" (a particularly pejorative term) is inadequate to describe these beings. Maybe they are gods or angels or some- thing of the sort. If we rule this out, we eliminate av- enues of research that could yield rich insights, not only into who they are, but also into who we are. This is not a ridiculous conclusion, but one based on hard scien- tific evidence. No intermediate species have ever been dis- covered to fully account for the theory of evolution, and even the discoverer of DNA, Dr. Francis Crick, believes that DNA was brought here by extraterrestri- als millions of years ago. (See his book, Life Itself, Simon and Schuster, 1981.) Any effort to resolve the UFO mystery which does not explore the origins of the human species, does not question the current views about the nature of consciousness, does not examine the religious implications, and which does not attempt to peer into future science through the lens of quantum physics is doomed to failure. But Jacobs never mentions any of this. He has never attempted to broaden his horizons and to reach higher levels of understanding. Yet, at the same time, I admire him. He has performed his role well. His dili- gent research has revealed and verified many of the basic elements of the abduction phenomenon. I am willing to embrace him and give him credit for that and for his courage in stepping into this difficult arena in the first place. We need him and others like him. But what we don't need is this lashing out and name calling directed at those who are struggling in their own way to solve the same baffling mystery. Jacobs has fallen prey to the illusion that he, and only he, has the real answers. Standardized procedures? He argues for a standardization of procedures for abduction research. \"Without standardized meth- odology,\" he states,\" a hypnotist can use any induction or questioning technique-no matter how experimen- tal, untried, or dubious-to explore abduction accounts.\" (p. 220) To this, I can only say, \"Thank God!\" Jacobs believes that if only all researchers used the same ex- act hypnotic induction he uses, and asked the same questions that he asks, they too would arrive at the same conclusions. To this, I can only say, \"No kidding!\" The fact that all abduction researchers are not clones of himself and regulated by some abduction research regulation authority is cause of great frustration for Jacobs. That fact, together with his conclusion that the Earth is about to be taken over by aliens, has led him into the depths of a deep depression: \"...I have found the abduction phenomenon to be real, but also...I have become somewhat apocalyp- tic in view of its purpose. I have come to the conclu- sion that human civilization may be in for a rapid, and perhaps disastrous, change, not of our design.\" (p. 255) He continues his lament: \"...the intellectual safety net with which I operated for so many years is now gone. I am as vulnerable as the abductees themselves... .1 have come to view the alien abduction phenomenon and its purpose as an asteroid hurtling toward Earth-discov- ered too late for intervention... .1 find little fuel for hope for the future.\" (p. 256) Jacob's feelings of fear and futility should be"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1998 Page 17 of great concern for members of the research commu- nity and for abductees as well. Researchers, whether they like it or not, must also act in the best interests of the \"patient\"-the abductee. Hypnosis is not just a re- search tool, but also a therapuetic one, and part of the role of the researcher is to help the abductee overcome his/her fears. How can Jacobs or other researchers who are frightened themselves help others? John Mack and many other reseachers, includ- ing myself, have seen first hand the amazing spiritual and mental growth that is experienced by those abductees who shed the victim role, put their fears aside, and moved forward. These individuals will no doubt lead us all toward a much higher level of under- standing than anything we can now imagine. But without the positive support of the thera- pist, many experiencers will continue to dwell in the depths of depression. As objective researchers, we should, at the very least, honor (rather than ridicule) those who are able to achieve this remarkable trans- formation. At the very most, we should stand as pillars of strength for those who so desperately seek our help. Dr. Jacobs' response to Dr. Lewels: I would like to thank Dwight Connelly for af- fording me the opportunity to make a brief reply to Dr. Lewels. I think that it is important for UFO and abduc- tion research to be as scientific and as accurate as pos- sible. Rigor and the systematic investigation of the phe- nomena have allowed UFO researchers to engage in the process of solving the UFO mystery. UFO research- ers from the 1940's on have attempted to look with a scientifically objective eye at the claims made not only by charlatans and the deranged, but by sincere wit- nesses as well. These pioneers worked out standardized meth- odologies whereby the UFO signal could be separated from the IFO noise. We cannot abandon this scientific stance. We must maintain and foster high standards and continue to work for a solution to the UFO mys- tery through serious, reality-based modes of thought. For some abductees, angelic, demonic, spiri- tual, and New Age interpretations of the UFO and ab- duction phenomenon are important in that they pro- vide them with an emotional framework in which they can understand the phenomenon and/or receive solace and comfort from it. Self-motivated belief structures that help abductees cope with their situations-and are not harmful-can sometimes be beneficial, at least in the short term. However, as explanatory systems for the evi- Editor's Note: With a profound interest in abduction cases, 1 have discussed with both Dr. Jacobs and Dr. Lewels their particular approaches to abduction research. Both, in my opinion, are dedicated, sincere individu- als with exceptional ability and integrity. Obviously they represent opposing methods, which should be of interest and concern as we attempt to untangle the ab- duction phenomenon. The Threat was reviewed last month, and an adequate understanding of Dr. Jacobs' approach can best be found in reading the entire book, just as Dr. Lewel's ap'proach is best understood by reading his book, The God Hypothesis-anA in talking with both men. Although authors automatically open themselves to critiques, I felt that Dr. Jacobs should be afforded the opportunity to respond in the same issue of the Journal to this added critique. dence presented, New Age, spiritual, and religious in- terpretations must be treated with utmost caution. In The Threat, by critically evaluating methodology, I have attempted to understand the accounts that some hyp- notists have found and that I, and other more main- stream investigators, have not found. No one's research is above critical analysis-including my own. Without critical analysis and peer review it will be extremely difficult to advance in our knowledge of this subject. To suggest otherwise is to insure that we will be taking backward steps into confusion rather than moving for- ward toward knowledge and clarity. We all want the goal of abduction therapy to be for abductees to lead happier lives. The difference is that some researchers attribute whatever positive changes that take place to the aliens' actions. I have more faith in people's innate abilities to integrate ab- duction events so that they can lead more fulfilling lives. Through therapeutic help, support groups, and their own self-awareness, abductees gain intellectual and emotional control over their lives and move for- ward with a renewed sense of mastery over the phe- nomenon. For the conscientious investigator, helping the abductees achieve this must be accomplished with integrity and intellectual honesty. I hope that Dr. Lewels will eventually under- stand the importance of undertaking a scientific and objective study of not only the abduction evidence, but of the methods whereby that evidence is obtained. We owe this to the UFO research community and we es- pecially owe this to the abductees who rely on us to find the truth about what has been happening to them. This is our responsibility, and we must not shrink from it."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 May 1998 MUFON UFO Journal The UFO PRESS Timothy Good. Alien Base, Earth's Encounters With Extraterrestrials (London: Century, 1998) Reviewed by Warren P. Aston Copyright 1998 At the outset I do not hesitate to say that, in my opinion, Alien Base has joined a small group of books that will come to be regarded as pivotal and classic works in shaping our understanding of the phe- nomenon of alien contact. I believe it will eventually be seen as authoritative and substantial in its field as Good's Beyond Top Secret now is. Timothy Good's greatest contribution in this book is to force the reader to face a substantial body of data that has, in many cases, been routinely ignored and ridiculed by many UFO researchers and groups in recent decades, and kept from the public at large. Good tackles head-on the disturbing direction that mainstream ufology has taken in the past two decades by the al- most institutionalized rejection of reports involving contact with humanoid beings to the point where \"alien contact\" in ufology and in the public perception equates only to an \"abduction\" by a stereotype \"Grey.\" Not the standard scenario The cases covered in Alien Base are anything but the standard abduction scenario. Good has amassed ufology's largest collection of reports where the wit- ness has encountered, and often interacted with, be- ings of apparent extraterrestrial origin, sometimes liv- ing incognito among us. A handful of intriguing cases also suggest that one or more alien groups have hu- mans living with and working with them. Many of the book's reports are published here for the first time, and the cumulative weight of their evidence is impres- sive. The author does not shy away from the famous \"contactee\" cases of the fifties and sixties, but suc- ceeds in integrating their stories as part of a larger con- tinuum of alien contact, not apart from it. In the pro- cess it quickly becomes clear that such claims are not as rare as many people have assumed. This is not to say that Good accepts that all the contactee claims are genuine—far from it. But he makes a strong case that perhaps in some instances what began as a genuine encounter was then perpetuated, for any number of reasons, by deception and fraud. Case in point, perhaps: George Adamski. Alien Base, to the inevitable dismay of some readers, I'm sure, devotes a long section to Adamski's story. Much of this material will be familiar to any well-read re- searcher, but some will not be, and is therefore worth approaching with an open mind. The original or early aspects of this case are stronger than many are willing to give it credit for, and while I personally remain unconvinced, Good gives some good reasons why the case should not be rejected out of hand or tossed into the \"too hard\" basket. Not least of these are the appar- ently credible stories of other people with impressive parallels to Adamski's claimed experiences. Daniel Fry and Howard Menger are covered, and the book goes into considerable detail about the Paul Villa case, devoting more than half its color illus- trations to some of his photos, making it clear that here are cases that still cry out for solid investigation. Definitive treatment needed Despite the time that has elapsed, definitive treatments of these cases have yet to be written. Al- though not without its faults and biases, Kal Korff's devastating expose of the Billy Meier case (Spaceships of the Pleiades) is a recent example of what an inten- sive investigation can achieve and what remains to be done with the classic contactees. Some readers may feel more comfortable with other stories that Good examines in detail, such as the little-known Carroll Watts and Bruno Ghibaudi cases with their impressive photographic support, or with the fantastic but com- pelling \"Joelle\" and Ludwig Pallmann cases. Alien Base, however, makes a contribution beyond the mere compiling of reports. By including some of the very early encounters (the 1920 Albert Coe case is the earliest, with a good sampling of cases from the thirties and forties, including my own research of the 1940 Wartena case) the book repudiates, for example, the continuing simplistic attempts by some to dismiss all genuine UFO sightings as man-made military craft. The careful reader will note certain recurring themes throughout the encounters reported, regardless of the circumstances, the time period, or the witness. Notably, these include the pervasiveness of the basic human form throughout the Cosmos, that earth has al- ways had alien monitoring and intervention, that intel- ligent life on earth was \"seeded\" from other worlds, that man destroyed his civilization thousands of years ago, and a variety of environmental concerns. Many races of visitors Implicit in all this is the unavoidable conclu- sion that earth is being visited by many races, far more than the conventional half-dozen or dozen races nor- mally allowed for in the ETH. A strong case could be made for at least a score or more, based just on the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 1998 Page 19 better documented and more believable cases printed in this book. My criticisms of Alien Base are minor. Inter- spersed throughout the text are a number of conven- tional UFO reports, perhaps to introduce variety and perhaps sometimes to strengthen the book's premise that our planet is being used as a base by extra- terrestrials. While they are usually interesting and sub- stantial sightings that deserve recording, in my opinion they lengthen the text unnecessarily, and their omission could have served either to reduce the size of the book or to allow more contact cases to be included. Better cases Surely there would have been more value in including, for example, the Rev. Gill case-a multi-witnessed sighting of humanoids atop a craft- rather than yet another daylight disk report. In particu- lar I would also have liked more space spent on the information communicated in the 1976 Dr. Leopoldo Diaz case, a totally credible witness. A chronological listing of all the cases would have been both helpful and interesting, and would make comparisons easier and trends more obvious. Those in the UFO community inclined to reject out-of-hand the type of reports found in Alien Base will undoubtedly be less charitable toward this book, and may feel that I have been over-generous in my assess- ment of its value. For the rest of us however. Alien Base is a reminder that whatever our individual assumptions and biases lead us to do with such accounts, these too are an integral part of ufology. Phillips to revisit famous Delphos, KS, case Ted Phillips, the foremost ground trace re- searcher in the world, is revisiting the famous Delphos, KS, case. Phillips says there are two reasons for do- ing this. First is a commitment he made to the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, just prior to Dr. Hynek's death, to return to Delphos. Phillips and Dr. Hynek worked together on numerous ground trace cases, and Delphos was considered one of the best. \"That's the second reason I want to do it,\" says Phillips. \"It's one of the best cases on record. It's a classic. It deserves to be fully and completely nailed down.\" Phillips requests that anyone having informa- tion on the Delphos case, such as photos, reports, news clippings, or witness information, contact him.

MUFON FORUM Letters to Mufon UFO Journal In Gildas Bourdais' article (Part 3/March 1998), he refers to highlights of once \"Secret\" CIA documents of the early 1950's cited in my book UFOs: The Public Deceived. Bourdais refers to a CIA memo of 2 December 1952 which he claims \"reveals a com- plete change of tone. It is regretable that Klass does not mention this memo, although it was declassified in 1975, eight years before the publication of his book!\" The memo, written by H. Marshall Chadwell, is mentioned, and its contents highlighted, on page 26-27 of my book. It was declassified in 1979, not in 1975. Bourdais also errs in claiming that shortly af- terwards the CIA submmed a proposal to the National Security Council that the agency launch its own UFO investigation. As reported in my book, there were other CIA officials who disagreed. To help the CIA resolve this issue was the purpose of convening the group of top-level scientists, headed by Dr. H.P. Robertson, in early 1953 to evaluate the best UFO evidence. As reported in my book (p. 31), on Feb. 18, 1953, a top CIA official-after reviewing the conclu- sions of the Robertson panel-wrote to the Intelligence Advisory Committee: \"The results of the [Robertson] panel's studies have moved the CIA to conclude that no National Security Council Intelligence Directive on this subject is warranted.\" Philip J.

Index = 18.0% In- vestigators: Beverly Trout, Richard England, Ken Mott A family member called Offutt Air Force Base and TV stations in Omaha and Des Moines to report the anomaly. The MUFON State Director was told of the event on June 18 by a journalist in Creston, IA. Arriving home on Thursday, the two witnesses listened to a message left on their answering machine by a trucker. The man claimed he had seen lights in their field ten days earlier. The witnesses never learned who the caller was, but they did remember that one night earlier, as they were driving home from Bedford, they saw a light that \"lit up the countryside\" for a couple of seconds. Friday morning, the two went to check out their fields and discovered two circular indentations about 10 feet in diameter and separated by about nine feet. Both were sunken three to five inches on the outer pe- rimeter but not in the middle. Corn stalks were piled up just outside each circle. The owners knew the circles had not been there two weeks earlier. Measurements performed by the investigators close to three weeks later found that the two circles were of equal size and shape, measuring 139 inches in diameter and having a 48-inch wide depression on the inside of the perimeter. The 43-inch center was not sunken. The depth of the depression was measured at about one and one-half inches. Erosion by rain had re- duced the depth over the three-week period. (It was not known if the soil had been wet or dry when the circles were formed, so the depth measure would not give an accurate tool to estimate the causing agent's weight.) The circles were located on a flat ridge in the 160-acre field. The ridge was high enough to have a good view of the surrounding area, possibl> tor miles. The ndgc had not been planted in 1996, and the corn stalks \\vcro loft over from the 1995 season. They were lying as if they had been blown down, fanning outward from the circular traces. In the center, weeds and grasses appeared to be growing normally, but, except for a few new starts, the sunken area was plant barren. A return trip by the investigators a week later found that the area had been sprayed, which would affect any soil analysis, but samples were taken. The grasses and weeds which had been growing normally were now all wilted, including those surrounding the circles.

Thompson Driving southward on South Davis Road with her pre-teenage daughter, a woman saw a green light on a downward trajectory to their south. She called it a glowing green round ball, later referring to it as \"shiny green\" and \" neon green.\" After it had reached the ground, four helicopters flew into the area at tree top altitude, shining search lights toward the ground. She and her daughter thought the helicopters were search- ing for l ho green object. This event may have been ignored, but the same woman, with her young son, had seen a similar green object a week earlier. Like this one, the object went to the ground. Before it did so, it first hovered, then flew horizontally. Note: It is not uncommon for flares to be dropped to practice search operations, but there was no indication that this was such an exercise. UFO conferences... (Continued from Page 5) lights was the talk by Iowa MUFON State Director Beverly Trout on \"Talking Back to the Aliens and to Humans.\" I also had the opportunity to renew friend- ship with Lou Parish on a face-to-face basis after years of correspondence by e-mail and phone, as well as with Ted Phillips, who, like Lou, was a member of the old Skylook staff when I was editor-publisher. It was also great to socialize with Walt and Jean Andrus. As I look ahead to the MUFON Symposium in June, I anticipate a great program featuring some of the best in the business. Professor Stanley McDaniel, editor and one of the authors of The Case for the Face, will be one of the speakers, and I am eager to hear his views on the latest Mars images. Dr. David Jacobs, author of The Threat, and Dr. Joe Lewels, author of The God Hypothesis, will, perhaps for the first time, be speakers at the same symposium. Discussions con- cerning their very different approaches to handling abduction cases should be interesting and enlighten- ing. Nancy Talbott has some significant information to discuss concerning physical evidence related to crop circles, animal mutilations, and landing sites. The vid- eos to be presented by Jaimie Maussan, including the famous Aug. 6, 1997, Mexico City video, are not to be missed. The list of outstanding speakers also in- cludes Ann Druffel, Michael Lindemann, Debra Lindemann, Tracy Tonne, Dr. Richard Haines, and Joe Escamilla.

Tom plans to attend the Denver Symposium, so take this opportunity to congratulate him and for the fine work that he is doing with our Associate Member Auxiliary. ILLEGAL USE OF MUFON.ORG A Myron Saunderberg at \"Admin@- mufon.org\" is putting messages on E-mail implying that he speaks for MUFON. He definitely is not a MUFON member and has no authority whatsoever to suggest that he is. Three fellows in St. Louis, MO are using a web site with the address mufon.org, however, none of them are or ever have been MUFON mem- bers. The Missouri State Director gave them permis- sion to use it without authorization from MUFON head- quarters, not knowing that he had no control over its use. The fellows involved intended to represent and charge MUFON for the web site. See the masthead of this Journal for our official web site and E-mail ad- dresses. Anything with mufon.org is not a legal ad- dress. Opportunists literally jump on the bandwagon and try to take advantage of MUFON's credibility in the UFO field. MUFON LAPEL PINS Due to the popularity of the attractive lapel pins, we have received another order for distribution. The one-inch long oval-shaped pin has the MUFON logo in blue on a white background outlined in silver with a pin clasp on the back suitable for fastening to clothing. You may order yours from MUFON in Seguin, TX for $5 plus $1 for P&H. This is an opportunity to let people know that you are a MUFON member by proudly wearing our new lapel pin. AWARD FOR SECURING NEW MEMBERS Numerous MUFON members shared their in- terest in the MUFON UFO JOURNAL by purchasing Christmas gift subscriptions for friends and relatives. We are extending this idea with a new concept to in- crease our overall membership. Any current MUFON member will be awarded a lapel pin if they solicit two new members by completing the enclosed form (page 22 or a copy thereof) and attaching a $30 check for each new member. A former member who has allowed his/her sub- scription to expire for over one year will qualify as a new member in this plan. Here is your opportunity to invite people who attend local meetings, your friends and relatives to join MUFON and you will benefit by receiving a free lapel pin. FOREIGN MEMBERSHIP/SUBSCRIPTION PRICE TO BE INCREASED Based upon the \"Membership Journal Survey\" recently conducted, it was the consensus of the vast number of members responding that the foreign mem- bership/subscription rate should be increased to $35, consistent with the larger postage charges for mailing to foreign countries. Most magazines charge this dif- ferential rate to foreign subscribers. MUFON was ba- sically subsidizing a portion of the postage. This is an advance notice that the $35 rate will become effective immediately for new members and to all others upon their renewal date. The subscription/ renewal forms are being revised, accordingly."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 May 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Walter Andrus Left to right: Sun Shili, Ph.D. and J.
