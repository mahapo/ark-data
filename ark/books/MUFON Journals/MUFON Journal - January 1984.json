FROM THE EDITOR This issue is, we feel, significant in several aspects, and it will probably ruffle a few feathers. First, in our lead article, Deputy Director John Schuessler takes a blunt look at ufology in America today. He pulls no punches and spares no one, not even MUFON. Secondly, we try to kill off for good a clever 1977 hoax that some researchers have begun to believe really did happen. And, one of MUFON's former state directors tells why he resigned and intends to pursue his research independently of any organization. In addition to all this, we have some good features that will please everyone (we hope). Whatever, let us hear your reaction to any or all of these pieces.

STATE OF UFOLOG Y By John F. Schuessler Copyright© 1984 Schuessler What is happening in the field often referred to as UFOLOGY? Where are we going? Is there an end in sight? These are some questions posed to me by Bob Pratt, editor of the MUFON UFO Journal. This estimate of the situation is my opinion only, based upon 19 years of involvement in the field. It is difficult to find factual, up to date UFO information on the book and magazines counters anywhere in the United States at this time. But wherever anything is published it is sold out within hours. The public is left with no alternative but to turn to the tabloids — the National Enquirer, Examiner, Star, Globe, Weekly World News. Millions of copies are sold weekly and read in households all over America. Their UFO content is often questionable and at times is pure trash. People could correct this situation by calling or writing to their store managers or publishers and demanding something better; but due to a general feeling of apathy this doesn't happen. The bulk of the work associated with UFO investigations, reporting, analyses, and communications is done by volunteers. Many of the volunteers operate as part of large networks controlled by not-for-profit organiza- tions, while others choose the free- lance route. The network apporach seems to be more successful because of costs associated with travel and communica- tions across great distances. Unfortunately, however, many of the volunteers are dropping out. Various reasons are given, but according to a number of the dropouts there is a common thread in their reasons. The Attacks Most of the volunteers are intelligent, mature individuals holding worthwhile jobs in industry and government. Although more than half of these people have never seen a UFO, their feelings of concern, intellectual stimulation, love of a mystery, or frustration with the general lack of acceptable answers drives them to invest countless hours and dollars in their quest for truth. In their work they are encouraged to investigate, speculate, hypothesize, test and report, regardless of the type of job they hold. However, when they do the same thing associated with a UFO incident, they receive attacks from all directions. Key in the attacks on UFO investigators and witnesses alike is a group that likes to be called \"skeptics,\" when clearly they are common \"debunkers.\" They denigrate anything or anyone that even hints at having a position counter to theirs, especially in relation to UFO or paranormal events. They stop at nothing to make their point. They often omit data, bend facts, fabricate information, conduct personal attacts on individuals, and shoutdown their opponents. They do all this under the guise of protecting the public. They call and write television networks, stations, and personalities in an attempt to suppress any type of program not to their liking. Intimidation is used, and it usually works. In November 1983, a conference containing a UFO Watergate theme was held at the University of Nebraska. It was reported that Philip Klass, a known debunker, had called the university officials and conference organizers in an attempt to stop the event. He allegedly made accusations that the participants were communist sympathizers because they questioned why the United States Government would not release all appropriate UFO information. If one would follow his line of thinking, then all our candidates for public office, even the Presidency, would be considered communists because they question how things are being done by those already in office. His actions could be questioned on the basis of his own employment. He is a senior editor for Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine, known by people employed in the aerospace industry and government alike as Aviation Leak, because it is said to leak government technical secrets to the world. Abusive Approach The debunkers have given themselves a feeling of legitimacy, forming the basis for their operation. The fact is, there is no requirement for anyone to reply to their demands for information or to accept their abusive approach. Their journals are blatantly one-sided and dedicated to the elimination of another point of view. At the same time they complain if they are not given equal billing at conferences, in bulletins of private organizations, and anywhere people choose to disagree with their point of view. In general, they seem to have a miserable outlook and want, even demand, everyone else to feel the same way. Many of the volunteer investiga- tors are professional people, giving valuable hours freely to the work of UFO investigations. When they become the target of a debunking attack, they will often accept an easy and non-threatening answer for a case rather than risk the wrath of the debunker. Then, when the next case comes along, they will be too busy to work on it. After that, their activity is limited to reading the journals and possibly attending conferences where they can be anonymous in a crowd. They haven't lost their interest, but they are on \"safe\" ground with their peers. The North American UFO Federation was founded because a number of people saw a need for a unified approach to the UFO problem. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Schuessler, Continued Not only would the federation give strength in numbers, it would also dampen the effects of the anti- professional efforts of the debunkers. This is an excellent goal, but it may be difficult to achieve because the organizers will become targets for debunking and frustrated by the infighting of individuals in the member organizations! Over the years, UFO research organizations and clubs have sprung up and then faded away. All have contributed in some way to the state of ufology as it is today. Perhaps their best contribution is the support and help they have given the witnesses and victims of UFO events. Without these private groups, many thousands of people would have gone without help or hope. It is my opinion that they could have done much more, but due to power struggles, ego problems, and in-fighting they have built barriers to their own success. NICAP's Flaws NICAP was a powerful and long standing pro-UFO organization. Some of their investigations, research, and publications have stood the test of time and are viewed even today as excellent. NICAP could have been much more. As an organization, it had money and top notch people, but it also had some built in biases and limitations. Although UFO meant unidentified flying object, certain cases such as abductions were ground ruled out — they were not legitimate. With these self imposed limitations the organization was doomed to failure. The whole mystery could not be evaluated. The remaining large and well known pro-UFO organizations are The Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). Each has a body of specialists available as consultants and a shrinking population of subscribers to their publications. They blame public apathy, government cover-up and dirty tricks, and each other for their financial and organizational problems. While these JOHN SCHUESSLER Deputy Director of MUFON things may exist, they are only symptomatic, not the source of the problems. Although CUFOS has some extraordinary talent in its consultant group, the real success of the organization comes from association with the name of its founder, Dr. J. Allen Hynek. Dr. Hynek has demonstrated how one can be a professional in this field and not let the detractors deter him from his course. It is not important whether or not one agrees with his personal views on the subject. Rather, the important feature is the relentless attack on the problem. While some individuals were blasting the importance of landing trace information, Mrs. Hynek was assisting research specialist Ted Phillips in cataloging his hundreds of trace cases. With such a favorable image, why is CUFOS feeling the same financial pinch as MUFON, APRO and others? Perhaps it is because the organization has not changed with the times, recognizing changes in management styles, especially for volunteer organizations. The privilege of paying a fee once a year is not enough for many people. They need some personal feedback, an opportunity for involvement, a shield of protection from the detractors, and feeling of accomplishment. Only a few individuals are getting any of those things. Without a major UFO flap, CUFOS could shrink to a small group with little clout. This should not be allowed to happen. Whither APRO? APRO has similar problems. It's main claim to fame today is that is is the oldest organization of it's kind in existence. Due to the health problems of Jim and Coral Lorenzen, APRO has taken some hard hits in the past few years. Some of the people filling in have played some dirty tricks that have hurt the credibility of APRO. Again, unfortunate as this may be, it is just a symptom of the problem. Jim and Coral have failed to follow the first basic rule of management in an organization. That is to develop your successors and to give them authority and responsibility as they become capable. And second, they never learned that cooperation is healthy for everyone and need not be viewed as a threat. Because Coral viewed Walter Andrus as a threat, he was forced to leave APRO and form MUFON. If handled properly, that probably would have never happened and APRO would be even stronger today. A similar situation has developed with the North American UFO Federation. APRO has. refused to cooperate rather than to take a leadership role in NAUFOF, a real loss to both organizations. All this limits the hopes and goals of the many fine volunteers in APRO. MUFON As Well MUFON is having a different type of problem. As an organization, MUFON was based on the grass roots approach. In structure, this is good from a management viewpoint because it provides a hierarchy on a local, state, and national scale. And due to the dedication and hard work of Walter Andrus, this approach has been successful. In a grass roots organization, there is a great diversity in thought and opinion. When trying to solve a mystery of great magnitude, this diversity can be the key to success or failure. Unfortunately, a portion of the upper part of the hierarchy seems to be imposing limits on thought and technique. While this may be fine if one really knows all the answers, it can kill the very roots that will supply the data for actual answers. Without the grass (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Schuessler, Continued roots, MUFON will be devoid of data and finances, leaving only an upper hierarchal group to play mind games and wonder where the action went. Secrecy and government cover-up is claimed by most UFO organizations as the main problem in getting answers for the better sightings. While I cannot deny that is a very real problem, it is blown all out of proportion to the facts. I have personally spent three years working the Cash-Landrum case. This in an incident where the victims claimed to be harmed by a close encounter with a huge diamond-shaped object and frightened by the actions of a large number of obviously military type helicopters. Independent witnesses verified the sighting of the object and the helicopters. Government agencies responded to requests for information with an \"I don't know what you are talking about\" attitude. This is to be expected, but one would expect support from UFO researchers even if the government offered none. Dr. Hynek, head of CUFOS, and Walter Andrus, head of MUFON, have given strong support. On the other hand, Coral Lorenzen, head of APRO, and author William Moore have been very negative and critical of the case. They have claimed inside knowledge about the UFO, saying it was a malfunctioning government device, being flown in secret around Houston, Texas. If that is true, why not band together in a common goal and blow the top off of the cover-up. That never happened even though the victims could have been helped out of a terrible situation. Credibility Factor Government cover-ups is a good topic for authors and a good excuse for UFO organizations to lean on, but without facts it is really of little value. Claiming cover-up, Coral Lorenzen used the pages of the APRO BULLETIN to conduct a personal attack on the investigator in the Cash- Landrum case, rather than to publish substantiation for the APRO claim of cover-up. This is another example of the credibility problem that is being ignored by UFO organizations. It is common for the debunkers to conduct personal attacks on the investigators. It is a good way to detract from the results of the investigator's work, and it takes no real work on the part of the debunker. However, the pro-UFO people fall into the same trap fairly often these days. A good example is the case of Wendelle Stevens. Wendelle published a lot of material on cases that fall into the questionable category and never bothered to argue with his detractors. The debunkers . spent some time attacking his work in the Travis Walton case and then backed off when some of the more prominent pro-UFO people started attacking Wendelle on a personal basis, rather than attacking the results of his work. As an example of poor taste in a situation having nothing to do with UFOs, Wendelle was jailed for doing something disapproved of by society. William Moore, James Moseley, and Walter Andrus, among others, took great delight in playing up the details of this man's misfortune, some even writing about it in the pages of their UFO publications. Maybe they all felt better that they didn't get caught at something they did wrong in the past. One way or the other, UFO research did not come but looking any better as the result. Who will be next on the sacrifice block? Each of the major groups publish a bulletin or newsletter. The debunkers use their pages to tear down the work of others, usually using armchair techniques in lieu of field work. They do vast intellectual exercises, carefully force fitting the results of their efforts into the shape of their already announced opinions. It is great for distribution within a mutual admiration society, but it does nearly nothing for the resolution of the UFO mystery. Outside of the value it has for intimidating others, it is just a house of cards. Journal's Future The MUFON UFO Journal has had ups and downs. In the early days it served the \"grass roots\" very well. It is the only link that many members of the organization ever have with each other. First-hand reports of investigations and information about activities on-going within the whole of ufology were among the best features of the journal. In the more recent past, it became a forum for airing disagreements between believers and disbelievers, and even allowed the debunkers space to attack some responsible investigators. MUFON has lacked a technical publication or consultant's newsletter. Feeling this lack, there is a move to turn the MUFON UFO Journal into a quasi- technical journal, eliminating the grassroots inputs and making sure all that is printed fits the opinions of a few individuals. This seems to be the same game as played by the debunkers. I could cite other examples of the problems of ufology today, but that would probably be wasted effort. There appears to be a strong trend in the field of ufology to restrict the free interchange of information, ideas, and thoughts. Certain individuals want to define which books should be in libraries, which people one can communicate with, and what information can be discussed. This all sounds pretty repressive to me. Both sides, operating in a polarized environment, claiming only they have the key to the truth, have put limits on the search for this truth and the understanding of one of. the greatest mysteries of all time. Unfortunately, only a few hearty souls are willing to challenge this head in the sand outlook and go on to examine all the inputs. This examination does not constitute acceptance; rather it simply points out a need for a broader perspective on the situation and a greater use of available tools. It takes very little^examination to realize that neither of the polarized groups has found the key to the puzzle. Turning Point As a case in point, the MUFON UFO Journal carried a brief account of my firsthand observations of Australian researcher Stan Deyo. Mr. Deyo is viewed as a controversial figure by both sides, but neither has bothered to go and look into what the man is really doing and saying. I tried to give that view, without adding my personal opinions. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The anatomy of a hoax THE TRUTH ABOUT THE 'ELLSWORTH CASE 1 By BOB PRATT Editor, MUFON UFO Journal A story gaining credence among some UFO researchers concerns the reported landing of a UFO near a missile site in South Dakota on November 16, 1977, with the UFO's occupants stealing the missile's nuclear components and wounding a security policeman. It has come to be known as the \"Ellsworth Case\" because the missile site is under the command of Ellsworth Air Force Base near Rapid City, South Dakota. As one of those who investigated the alleged incident, I can say positively that it never happened. Unfortunately, some people choose to believe otherwise. Let me explain some of what I know about the \"Ellsworth Case\" and perhaps we can lay it to rest. The background On February 9,1978, when I was a staff reporter for the National Enquirer, we received an anonymous letter at our Florida 1 offices that was mailed from Rapid City. Because it apparently involved UFOs, it was turned over to Bill Dick, then an articles editor responsible for most UFO stories. It contained what appeared to be a carbon copy of an official U.S.' Air Force incident report, plus a brief, unsigned, typewritten note. The report was stamped FOR OFFICIAL USE. ONLY at top-and bottom. Supposedly from the commander of the 44th Missile Security Squadron, it described the'incident as a Helping Hand (security violation)/Covered Wagon (security violation) at Lima 9 (68th SMSq Area), 7 miles SW, of Nisland, SD, at 2100 hours on 16 Nov. 77. The person identified as receiving the report was PaulD. Hinzman, SSgt, USAF, Comm/Plotter, Wing Security Schuessler, Continued As a result, I was attacked by the debunkers because Stan Deyo is on that magic list of people that they say to avoid. On the other hand, I was accused by some pro-UFO people of giving credence to his work because I mentioned what I saw. Neither side really cares about the details; they simply want to be the censors. I resent this. Over the years I have communicated with people on all sides of the UFO controversy and I believe I have gained worthwhile information as a result. I have duplicated and mailed large piles of information, not because I agreed with the content; but because it was part of the data base and I felt it should be considered by those knowledgable in the field. I hoped new ideas would germinate and grow as a result of this free flow of information. It is a challenge I will not abandon, but I must admit my hopes for success are 6 dwindling. The common thread found in the reasoning of people dropping out may be summarized as follows: They dislike intimidation and unprofessional treat- ment, petty bickering upsets them, censorship or the withholding of information makes then feel left out, and they would like to see strong, but thoughtful leadership in their organizations. Ufologists are finding themselves at a turning point. Many are yielding to outside pressure and some are dropping out. Others are playing the game of \"gotcha\" with their fellow ufologists. If someone does not rise above petty organizational politics and the senseless attacks on the workers to lead this army of volunteers, then the present organizations will become ineffective little clubs at best. The ultimate solution to the UFO puzzle will never be realized and the countless victims of UFO encounters in the future will suffer needlessly. Control. It stated that two security policemen were involved, identified as Airmen First Class Kenneth C. Jenkins and Wayne E. Raeke (pronounced RAY-Key, we learned later). It also said the incident was investigated by Captain Larry D. Stokes and TSgt. Robert E. Stewart. The identity numbers and squdron assignments of all these men were also given. ' An OZ alert Briefly, the report (see illustrations) said that at 10:59 PM on November 16, 1977, an OZ, or Outer Zone, alarm had been activated at Lima Nine missile site (meaning the missile compound.had been penetrated) and that Jenkins and Raeke had been dispatched as a Security Alert Team (SAT) from the Lima Launch Control Facility, some 35 minutes away by road. Upon arriving at Lima Nine, Raeke went to the rear fence line, where he encountered an individual dressed in a glowing green metallic uniform and helmet, who fired some kind of weapon, disintegrating Raeke's rifle and, burning his hands and arms. Jenkins radioed for help, carried Raeke back to the SAT vehicle and then returned to the rear fence line himself. There, he saw two similarly dressed individuals, ordered them to a halt and when they didn't he shot them both, one through the shoulder and the other through the helmet. However, within seconds both rose up and disappeared over a hill. Jenkins followed them and saw them enter a 20- foot-diameter saucer-shaped object, which immediately took off and vanished over the horizon. Investigators later found that the missile's nuclear components were missing. Meanwhile, the injured Raeke was air-evacuated to an undisclosed location.

Reaction Obviously, this was a fantastic story, if it was true. The report form certainly seemed authentic, but the report itself sounded very much like a hoax. However, it had to be checked out. We were certain the Air Force would deny it, either way, so we did not make any immediate attempt to verify it through official channels. However, we did make a number of phone calls to Ellsworth and Rapid City and, to our surprise, everyone named in the report actually did exist. Furthermore, everyone was then on duty — except one. We could not reach Raeke, the airman allegedly burned and evacuated. The phone number given for him by the Base Locater simply didn't answer, as if it had been disconnected. By the end of the day we began to believe there might be something to this after all, and we decided to take a firsthand look. Everything was handled in great secrecy to protect any exclusive story that might develop. The next morning, Bill Dick and I and Tony Brenna, a GLOSSARY Helping Hand: Minor security violation. .

Both Sergeant Hinzman and Captain Stokes lived in the city, and I went to Hinzman's home and Brenna went to see Stokes. Hinzman was polite and courteous and he invited me into his home. When I related the story told in the report, he reacted with interest and genuine surprise, wondering why he had never heard about the incident before. Discrepancies Then, as we discussed the incident, he began to point out a few things wrong, including the fact that he was not a communications plotter for Wins Security Control but had a job connected with missile maintenace. He also said Sergeant Stewart's first name was Roderick, not Robert, and that Captain Stokes was not a Flight Security Officer (FSO), as the report said, but was in charge of all the FSOs for all the missile flights under Ellsworth's command. Across town, Brenna was hearing the same thing from Stokes, who also said that he had been in a hospital on the date in question.

He was asked to stop questioning Air Force personnel off base and was told that if we wanted to discuss the matter we were welcome to come to Security headquarters on Monday. Brenna agreed. That afternoon, a third reporter, Eric Mishara, flew in from another assignment and joined us. He rented a four-wheel-drive vehicle and spent most of the following week interviewing ranchers and others in the neighborhood of Lima Nine. He found no one who knew anything about the incident. On Monday morning, Dick, Brenna and I went to Ellsworth, but instead of talking with Security officials we were re-routed to the office of Major Arthur Jungwirth, information officer for the base.

Then, over the next five days, he arranged for us to interview in his office all of the key people named in the report — including Raeke, who had simply been out in the field for a number of days. Ellsworth commands Lima and 14 other missile flights consisting of 10 missiles each, all scattered across 13,500 square miles of western South Dakota. Security policemen such as Raeke and Jenkins (who, we later became convinced, had never met one another) spend a minimum of 72 hours in the field and often more when winter snows closed the roads As for the phone in Raeke's living quarters, it was simply out of order. We were allowed to tape record all interviews, and everyone we talked to (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Ellsworth, Continued answered virtually all of our questions (one sergeant said his personal life was none of our business). Jungwirth also gave us photocopies of Security Police Desk Blotters for both Lima Launch Control Facility and Wing Security Control, which were minute-by-minute logs of all activities on November 16 and 17. Everything was routine. He also gave us copies of hospital records showing when Captain Stokes was admitted and discharged. We meet Raeke Early in the week we talked with Raeke by phone while he was out in the field. On Thursday, when he returned to the base, he immediately came to Jungwirth's office and again submitted to our questions. Raeke also rolled up his sleeves and allowed us to photograph his hands and arms, which bore no signs of any injuries. 'Jungwirth, who also arranged for us to interview several other people not named in the report, was exceedingly cooperative throughout. During the week, we managed to take a good look at Lima Nine. Contrary to what the report said, there is no hill behind it and no way anyone could take cover from someone wanting to shoot at them. The area around the compound is quite flat, although there is a hill a quarter of a mile to the west. On Saturday, after nine days in Rapid City, Dick, Mishara and I returned to Florida while Brenna flew to Raeke's hometown in Indiana. There, he obtained a copy of the high school yearbook and verified that Raeke was, indeed, Raeke. He also checked with the director of the funeral home, who told us that Raeke was home on leave MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

At that tlae I obtained a copy of the original report. I thought at that tine that the Air ?orce would probably hush the whole thing up, and they did. The Air Force ordered the silence on I Dec 77, after which, the report was classified. There were 16 pictures taken at the scene. I do not have access to the pictures at this tine. The unsigned note that accompanied alleged report on November 16, attending his grandfather's funeral. Tapes PSE'd Back in Florida, I took all the tape casettes to C.R. McQuiston, an expert in PSE, or Psychological Stress Analysis. He analyzed the tapes and concluded that there was no reason to suspect that anyone we talked to in Jungwirth's office was telling us anything but the truth. However, McQuiston found sufficient stress in the tape of one person not named in the report to suspect he might have perpetrated the hoax. Some days later, Brenna returned to Rapid City and confronted that person. However, the man denied being involved, and the matter was dropped. We found more than 20 discrepancies or errors in the report — wrong names, numbers, occupations, physical layouts and so on. Had the Security Option alert mentioned in the report taken place, it would have involved all security personnel at the base, and everyone at the base and in Rapid City (population 45,000 plus) would have known about it. It would be easy to say the Air Force falsified numerous documents, muzzled everyone on the base and in the city, published a phony high school yearbook, and so on, but that is highly unlikely. The fact that the story is now circulating is perhaps my own fault. Several years later I described the whole thing to several UFO researchers as an example of hoaxes, and I probably passed on a copy of the alleged report. From there, the report gained a life of its own. Unfortunately, one researcher later was told by an Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) agent that the incident really did happen, and that is all some people needed. What the agent's motive was, I don't know. I have been told recently that he has since admitted it never .did occur. Last June, a national weekly magazine carried a story on the \"Ellsworth Case,\" and quoted a well known UFO researcher with several books to his credit as saying jt did happen and that the Air Force \"had snowed the investigators.\" Perhaps he was misquoted. If not, his own credibility is in question. We spent a total of 44 man-days investigating this at a cost to the Enquirer (counting salaries, expenses, etc.) of more than $15,000. We had no doubt that the incident as described in the so-called report never occurred.

Box 29 1-25121 Brescia, Italy 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"UFO HOTLINE REPORTS By BOB GRIBBLE The following is a flash report of incidents received at the National UFO Reporting Center, Seattle, Washington. All names of witnesses are on file at the Center. Jan. 21, 1984, 9:30 PM, Near Jasper, New York: While driving home to Edison, a mother and two children watched in amazement as an enormous gold, oval-shaped object appeared to pace their car. As they watched, the object appeared to land on a nearby ridge and after a few seconds it ascended into the sky. The mother said the object repeated this maneuver several times and when she increased and decreased the speed of the car the object did the same. At one time the object moved across the sky then returned to the area near her car. Jan. 22,1984,7:25 AM, 30 Miles East of Toledo, Ohio: The cabin crew of United Airlines flight 729, flying westbound at 43,000 feet, observed a blurry bright red object about the size of a DC-9 airliner move from northeast to southwest. The object, which was in view for only a few seconds, left a contrail which the airliner passed through. Jan. 22, 1984, 7 PM, Near Waycross, Georgia: While parked in a wooded area, a young couple spotted a large object approaching their car at treetop level. The object crossed the logging road near their car, went across an open area to a stand of trees, then turned end-for-end. At this point the driver put the car in gear and started down the road at a high rate of speed. Kenneth Arnold dies; 'Father' of the 'modern era' off UFOs Kenneth Arnold, whose sighting of nine objects flying at great speed over the Cascade Mountains of Washington on June 24, 1947, marked the beginning of what we now call the \"modern era\" of UFOs, is dead. An article in the Boise, Idaho, Statesman said he died January 16, 1984, in a hospital in Bellevue, Washington, leaving behind his wife and four daughters. The publicity given his 1947 sighting created enormous public interest worldwide in the phenomenon and added a new term to our language. In describing the sighting to reporters, Arnold said: \"They flew like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water.\" Headline writers immediately dubbed the objects \"flying saucers,\" a 10 term that today, 37 years later, is still widely used and recognized around the world. Arnold, then 32, was a civilian pilot and respected businessman, and in the years after the sighting literally thousands of people from around the world told him about their sightings. As he said at the International UFO Congress in Chicago, sponsored by Fate magazine on June 24,1977, the 30th anniversary of his sighting: \"Many of these people were very sympathetic...because I had stuck my neck out. I was stuck with my report. I couldn't hide any place, even if I didn't like the way some of the press treated me. So, these people came to me and told me their stories because they knew I would listen.\" Then the object made its way back toward the road and took a position directly over the car at very low altitude. The object had an L-shaped light pattern on the underside with two brilliant red lights and one green light. The glow from the red lights lit up the inside of the car and both occupants became hysterical. When the car reached the county road, the driver turned left and the object turned right. Then the object swung around and moved in behind the car and followed the fleeing vehicle for about 75 feet, turned left, and moved away at a high rate of speed. The sheriffs office received several calls about a strange lighted object in the area that night. Jan. 22, 1984, 7 PM, Arnold, Missouri: Two occupants of a car observed a circular object with three brilliant white lights and a corona of white light covering its entire surface. As the object approached the car, the driver made a 180-degree evasive turn only to have the object pull alongside and pace his vehicle. After about three minutes the object pulled away and left the area. The driver estimated that the object got to within 150 feet of the car, maintained an altitude of about 150 feet and was at least 25 feet in diameter. A vertical shaft of white light was also observed coming from the top of the object. After arriving home, the two witnesses observed three helicopters moving about in the area where the object was seen. Jan. 22, 1984, 7:09 AM, Huntingdon, West Virginia: On the way outdoors to start his car, the witness observed a large brilliant ball of orange light in a stationary position about 900 feet above the neighbors house. The glow from the ball illuminated the entire ground area.

The calls began coming in about 7:05 PM. The first report came in via the Lancaster State Police, who asked the witness to report his observation to us. This man said that he was traveling about eight miles south of Lancaster when he saw a bright greenish-glowing light in the southeast sky that appeared to be coming down at a 45-degree angle toward the horizon. The object was smaller than what a full moon looks like and had what appeared to be a reddish glow in the rear section, which was about the size of a golf ball and appeared to rotate. No trail was observed but the witness mentioned an unusual rotten egg smell around the area after the object passed. The vicinity of the sighting was near Faith Harbor, where a hydroelectric plant is located. Other reports followed that origin- ated from State Police stations as well as from actual observers in the counties of Carbon, Berks, Lancaster and York. One man from Shillington, 30 miles north of Lancaster, reported seeing a yellowish-green light moving across the sky. A woman from Hazleton was driving east on Route 80 when she saw a bright green light moving across the sky and bursting into flames. A man from Pardsville was traveling on Interstate 81 about half a mile from Dorrance when he saw a similar light. A check with the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle indicated they had received one report from Pennsylvania, but had numerous (continued on next page) Gribblc, Continued After about a minute, the object suddenly moved to the west at a high rate of speed. He detected no sound coming from the object. Jan. 27, 1984, 5:40 AM, Valley Center, California: Four witnesses observed five large, brilliant, stationary white lights in the northern sky. Four of the lights were in a diamond formation, with the light in the center of the formation. After watching the display for several minutes, they noticed smaller white lights maneuvering around the large lights. The small lights increased in number to a total of about 100 within a few minutes. Suddenly the formation moved away to the northwest and was accompanied by the small lights. As the formation started to move, the witnesses detected a soft humming sound. When first sighted, the lights were estimated to be two miles distant. The observation lasted for about eight minutes. Jan. 27, 1984, 6:15 AM, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania: Two young boys delivering papers observed a big circular object with lights around the edge hovering over houses about two blocks distant. They watched the object for several seconds, then it ascended into the sky at about a 45- degree angle. The boys did not detect any sound. Jan. 28, 1984, 6:30 PM, Remington, New Jersey: A young couple sighted an orange ball descending through the cloud layer and appeared to land on a ridge behind the tree line. Twenty minutes later, the husband observed a big, bright object ascending vertically from the same ridge, pause in mid-air, then move horizontally and disappear in the distance. The object that descended appeared to be as big as a hot air balloon. (The Center received 55 calls from a 15-county area describing the descent of a glowing object over New Jersey.) Jan. 30, 1984, 9 PM, 40 Miles West of Miami, Florida: Nine men working on an oil platform observed a bright orange object descending from the sky at a high rate of speed. When at an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet and about five miles distant, the object came to an instant stop. The bright orange glow faded and the crew observed an object with a bright chrome dome-shaped top and dozens of flashing lights on the underside. All witnesses agreed that the object was huge; No less than 200 feet in diameter. After remaining stationary for about ten seconds, the object turned a bright orange and instantly moved away to the east at a high rate of speed. The total observation time was about one minute. (A witness at Jensen Beach, about 100 miles northeast of the oil platform, observed the object dropping from the sky in a high speed vertical descent. Two witnesses in the Miami area also saw the object, one while the object was stationary west of Miami and the other while the object was moving to the east.) Feb. 7, 1984, 4 AM, Atco, New Jersey: The witness awoke to a loud humming sound and found his room illuminated by a bright light. He got out of bed, went to the window and saw a bright white circular object with a hump on top in a stationary position about four feet above his neighbor's yard. He estimated that the object was about 200 feet from him and the size of a small car. He saw an image like a man next to the object. The image vanished and the object ascended in a ziz-zag pattern, then moved away at a high rate of speed. The witness felt he observed the object for no more than ten seconds. The checked with the neighbors and they said they didn't see or hear anything. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"FORMER COMBAT PILOT SEES OBJECT 3 TIMES The following report was submitted by the late William D. Leet, MUFONState Director for Arkansas, shortly before he died. A well qualified former combat pilot for the Royal Canadian Air Force and the U.S. Army Air Force has reported three separate sightings of what may have been the same UFO within one month. The sightings occurred on the nights of March 9,20 and 29 in 1983, all after midnight. \"It was nothing like most of the ones that people report,\" said the witness, whose name is on file with MUFON. \"It did not have colored lights, nor could I detect any exhaust color, etc. It was not a helicopter, because the trees around my house did not stir or show any movement. \"All the sightings were after midnight and I am at a loss to know what would attract it to this area, as we have nothing of importance around here to attract anything.\" The sightings occurred from the man's home in Stamford, Texas. The nearest major airports are Dyess Air Force Base west of Abilene, 55 miles south of Stamford, and the municipal airport southeast of Abilene. The first sighting occurred about 1:50 AM on March 9. \"I got out of bed to adjust an electric blanket and while up I went to the bathroom,\" said the witness. \"For some reason, I glanced out of the bathroom window, which faces south, Gordon, Continued reports of a fiery object from ten counties in central New Jersey. PASU also contacted NORAD to see if it had any indication of a satellite re-entry or possible space junk burn up. An information officer took down the details and a short time later called back. He said he had had a conference call with all agencies that would be in a position to know of such events and they had no indication of a re-entry or burn up of space residue. From all indications, it is PASU's opinion that the sightings were of a bolide, a large fireball of the meteor class, that apparently was observed over a large geographical area. *** Similar reports were received on the morning of February 7. At 5:35 AM, the PASU UFO Hotline received a call 12 from the Pennsylvania State Police Headquarters in Harrisburg. The officer related that at about 3.AM six state troopers and a number of municipal police officers in the Harrisburg area had reported seeing a bright flaming object moving across the sky. Other units in Cumberland, York and Dauphin counties also reported similar observations. The troopers at first thought they were seeing t.he burning engine of an airliner that apparently was going to crash, but there were no crashes in the area and the information was then forwarded to PASU. The object moved horizontally across the sky from north to south and was observed for 10 to 15 seconds, leaving a burning trail. The information indicates a possible bolide or some space material burning up on re-entry. and there I saw two bright lights about 15 feet apart coming right down a side street. \"The object looked like a flying wing of some kind and was about 50 feet high. It seemed to be in a glide, not moving very fast. \"The lights were white and a little larger than ones used on a car. It was moving due north and I rushed into the next room to follow it when it passed out of view. \"I wear a hearing aid and as the hearing aid was not on at the time I was unable to detect any noise. \"I asked several neighbors if they heard or saw anything at that time but none detected anything.\" The second sighting was around 1:30 AM on March 20. \"For some reason, I woke up and detected a bright light lighting up the bedroom. I got up at once and looked through the Venetian blinds, and the same object was flying down the side street, going north just as it had before. \"I watched it for as far as I was able to see, and it stayed at about 50 feet high.\" The final sighting came about 1:15 AM on March 29. \"The last sighting happened about the same way, but this time the object came out of the west and circled around and came right down the middle of the street going north,\" said the witness. \"None of these sightings caused me to be alarmed, as I have always believed we are being watched by objects from outer space, and they are friendly or they could have blown us off the map by now. \"I did not stay up other nights or form a stake-out trying for more sightings or photographs. I thought it better to leave well enough alone.\""},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"UFO DISASTER AT GRIFFISS-ROME AIR FORCE BASE By PAUL C. CERNY Western Regional Director As the result of a radio talk show on KFRC and a similar show on KNEW two months later, both in San Francisco in the late 60's, I was rewarded with information about a highly classified encounter. This event took place at Griffiss-Rome Air Force Base near Utica, New York, in February 1949. The exact date could not be recalled by the witnesses. The communicaster on KFRC was Roy Elwell, with myself as a studio guest: We took a call from San Mateo, in the Bay Area, from a man named Al Dote, who at the time did not want his name used for the usual reasons. He was afraid of reprisals and that he might get into trouble, even though he was a civilian. It took some convincing on our part that we would keep his identity confidential at that time. He was very hesitant and cautious in his comments regarding the event he had witnessed, but was willing to tell us what had transpired at the base that night. A week later I interviewed Dote personally. ,, Dote was the leader of a small civilian band contracted to play for a party one night at the Officers' Club. It was on a weekend, as best he could recall. Four other band members were made aware of the event that would occur over the field that night, but not all saw it. Names of all witnesses are on file. Stepping outside for a cigarette break, Dote and another band member suddenly realized there was an unusual commotion on the base. Military personnel and vehicles were running around in a disorderly fashion. The band leader and his companion then noticed a large globe of bright iridescent white light about the size of a full moon or larger, hovering about 1,000 feet over the base runway. He described its appearance as similar to silk screening. The luminosity was steady and continuous. The time was roughly 10:30 PM. Many people, were watching the flowing ball. The uneasiness of field personnel and the distant shouting of orders was noted. A jet interceptor was scrambled and rapidly took to the air. The witness wasn't sure of the type of aircraft in the darkness, but thought it might have been an F-80. Once airborne and reaching the intruder's altitude, the Air Force jet made three passes at the lighted object, which immediately swung out of the jet's path in pendulum fashion each time the jet approached. The luminosity remained steady and continuous as the UFO stayed in relatively the same position all the time. On the fourth pass the object did not move out of the way. The jet slammed into it and exploded in a balj of fire. The glowing intruder immediately took off straight up into the night sky at a rapid rate of speed and disappeared from sight, obviously undamaged by the impact. Pandemonium broke out on the base. The Air Force lost a pilot and a jet aircraft to non-hostile UFO intervention. Witnesses were stunned at what they had seen. Shortly after the accident, Air Force personnel were handing out affidavits to sign, which read something like.. .\"I do declare that what I witnessed thereof I will disclose to no one...\", etc; typical legal jargon. Dote stuck his in his pocket and was somehow overlooked when Air Force personnel later gathered up the signed affadavits. About two months after the KFRC program, I was a guest on a KNEW talk show with Hilly Rose. A woman called in from Oakland to inquire about UFOs, and a question came up which prompted me to recall briefly the events of the Griffiss AFB incident. This rang a bell of recall from the caller. At that time, she had been employed as a civilian at Griffiss and remembered the incident very well. During the same period, her husband had been an Air Force colonel at the base but had recently retired. She said that as an Air Force wife, she was instructed not to discuss military matters. For many years she had worked in a Filter Center, which was a civilian defense network consisting of two very large plotting boards that overlapped. There were \"spotters\" all over the country encompassing many states. At the base, she worked as a volunteer from midnight to 5 AM. Many calls came in about UFOs, but at the time she did not believe they were authentic, thinking the persons calling in were just doing their patriotic duty. The base would occasionally send up interceptors, but would not send them up unless something was really there, she said. They would not deliberately risk the lives of the crews, she stated, but they did have a number of casualties involving jet scrambles to intercept unknowns. (The accident witnessed by Al Dote could have been one of these.) The colonel's wife .was finally convinced there was something to the stories and the resulting casualties. While stationed at the base, her husband was sent out on calls to check on these sightings. Base records indicated that our aircraft were never fired on by the unknowns. The mishaps all seemed to be for mechanical failure or human error. At no time was there ever an explosion in the aircraft; the accidents all remained a mystery. The \"Dew Line\" was just being installed and the big concern was aircraft possibly coming across Siberia through Canada to the Columbus- Dayton, Ohio, vicinity, which at that time was one of the prime target areas because of the four big government installations there.

The investigation was carried out by Jo McKinnon, who lives in Panama City, Florida. The primary witness is Myrna Henderson, 40. She said that one night about 11 PM during the summer of 1977, she and her son and daughter were playing a game in their home on the northern edge of Panama City. Their dog and cat suddenly hid and then Myrna noticed that she could not hear any of the normal insect sounds from outside. Cerny, Continued program interview with Dote, she recalled that she had been on duty that night, right after the accident. The next day the papers made light of the story, she said, adding that community-wise, the air base was not too popular anyway. Although the program host and I asked her to write to us, we never heard from her again. Tape recordings of these interviews are retained. 14 She and the children went outside and saw a circular object just above the trees west of the house, about 150 feet from them. \"It was round and very big, with green, orange, yellow and white lights going in a circle,\" said Myrna. She and her children were frightened by the object. \"It was as big as a house and as bright as a spotlight,\" she said. \"It hovered there about 15 minutes and then raised up and took off to the north and went out of sight.\" The object was silent except for a \"whoosh\" on departure. \"All the neighbors' animals were quiet.\" said Myrna. \"It was so quiet you could hear yourself breathe. No insects. You could hear nothing for about 30 minutes.\" Myrna appears to be quite sincere and there appears to be no motive for a hoax. LETTERS Editor, As one whose field is astronomy and who has had personal discussions with Mr. Klass, I must add my two cents to the Klass-Hall exchange (No. 188, October 1983) regarding the Mansfield helicopter episode. Having once reviewed Klass's second book (UFOs Explained) for another UFO organization in which I called the author's Mansfield fireball hypothesis \"a gross exaggeration,\" I was astounded to learn that Klass still stands by that explanation! If one consults the primary authoritative investigator's detailed account of this case (Jennie Zeidman) and also rejects the initial two-minute discontinuous observation of a red light, one still emerges with an estimated timeline for the continuously observed UFO of at least four minutes! Now the Orionids happen to be extremely swift meteors, averaging 66 km/sec. Bright fireballs from this shower might occasionally last several seconds but certainly not minutes. The longest duration fireball reported in recent times was that of the August 10, 1972, daytime event witnessed across parts of the western U.S. and Canada. This exceptional fireball appeared to have been an asteroid that was temporarily captured in the earth's atmosphere then slid back out into (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Letters, Continued space. Duration estimates for that one ranged from half a minute up to a full minute. However, most abnormally slow meteors fall within the half-minute upper limit cited by Hall in his review; even these (15- to 30-second fireballs) are exceedingly rare. But the really salient feature of the helicopter sighting is the reported structural detail — a domed, cigar- shaped object with an indented trailing edge arid discrete body lights, fore and aft, including a swinging spotlight! No amount of distortion by Klass can twist that description into imagined details on a fireball stopped (for an estimated 10 seconds) in mid-flight! I have noted that the nearer and more structured the reported UFO, the more difficulty Klass has in coming up with a reasonable hypothesis for the event. Although I have credited the author in the past for contributing what I thought were viable alternative solutions for some well publicized UFO cases, Klass's credibility breaks down with the close-range encounters. It is unfortunate that he either unconsciously or deliberately overlooks important pertinent data in these types of incidents, often resorting to distortion, omissions, and innuendo in order to force-fit the facts into his preferred prosaic explanation. These are the selective thought processes of someone who is so sure he is right that his own bias prevents any meaningful insight into the possibility that a truly unknown phenomenon may in fact exist. Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant Westwood, MA Editor, In response to your request about the Journal material, I would like to comment. 1.1 do believe from my many UFO lectures that there is ALWAYS a great interest in the UFO phenomena. And this is regardless of the fact that the media has been \"put behind the Iron Curtain\" and that most all of the UFO books in America are OFF the shelves! 2. Because this is a fact, the Journal could be made interesting by writing up the sightings which you as a center no doubt have many. 3. The last Journal (No. 187) with some thoughts about the Cash- Landrus case, was then filled with the most uninteresting material I ever read, going deep into scientific details of all kinds and the publishing of so many names, business, organization problems etc., all of which are interesting to a very limited number of persons. On the other hand, should there be no sightings at all to report, then tear up this letter and forget I wrote it. Over the last few years I have been in quite a few cities and gone into many bookstores to see what the UFO shelf has to offer. It is easy to see that there is a \"silence group\" in command, as there are no UFO books. Norman A. Weis Kenmore, NY Editor, I would like to thank the MUFON UFO Journal's past editor, Richard H. Hall, for the excellent journalistic efforts he contributed to the success of the Journal, as well as his professional coverage of various UFO symposiums over the years. Our loss in the UFO field will be someone else's gain. I met him first at NICAP's office in Washington, D.C., in January 1964. After 20 years, I have just begun to fully appreciate his many professional contributions to the UFO field worldwide. Again, my thanks and continued best wishes to Dick. George D. Fawcett Lincolnton, NC Editor, I wish to continue my subscription to your journal since I find, though not as interesting as I would like, every now and then it does give some new and intriguing data. In the October '83 issue, the article on the Pennsylvania sightings is especially interesting. It gives several detailed eyewitness accounts and is supported by artist drawings which give the reader a \"visual\" image. Please do more, much more of these. Also, would like to see info on religious viewpoint, info from people who have seen UFOs and have then been hypnotized to re-live, so to speak, the sighting (how they felt, what they saw). UFOs exist. The governments of this world have accounts, journals and books have well publicized eyewitness accounts. But what does the subconscious mind (the synthesized all- knowing computer bank of the mind) register? That is the unexplored field. And what is the message from UFO visitors? Nothing is without purpose. Explore. You have just begun. Elaine M.Neal Waltham, Mass. Some thoughts on extraterrestrials Any extraterrestrial intelligence with enough advanced technology to get themselves here would not only have powers but intellects beyond our comprehension. Not that we would look like semi-evolved primates, but asking them to think on our level would be like asking Einstein to balance your checkbook... It is a mistake to simply treat extra- terrestrials as a purely scientific interest. Some scientists in particular seem to assume that any visitor would hand over themselves, and their technology, for study. Then of course we could be certain that UFOs are extraterrestrial... If we consider what the more reliable abduction cases indicate, things become...alarming. They remind me of those National Geographic films where a helicopter approaches a bear who is promptly shot with a tranquilizer. He is tagged and examined, but not physically harmed. But any psychological trauma the bear might experience cannot be avoided..! If UFOs are indeed extraterres- trial, then they do tell us some good things. Our visitors are not good guys out to save humanity from itself, but they are not bad guys out to destroy and enslave us. They are just living, thinking beings who are probably too far removed from our level of existence for us to understand them. Brian Parks Torrance, Calif 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"'EARTH-BASED' UFOS By MICHAEL A. LEWIS Former State Director for Wyoming Unidentified Flying Objects, and their alleged occupants, are not of extra-terrestrial origin. Let me repeat that: Unidentified Flying Objects, and their alleged occupants are NOT of extra-terrestrial origin. There, now I feel better, having said it in public. This conclusion, flying in the face of current trends in UFO research, has been sneaking up on me over the last few years, and has finally taken hold with a certainty that I can no longer ignore. I hope, in this article, to lay the ground work that led to my turn around in belief, and perhaps sow a seed of caution among my colleagues. I began my association with the \"Flying Saucer\" mystery some seventeen years ago, firm in the belief that we were being visited by what I hoped were benevolent beings from another world. My progress in UFOdom followed the now familiar pattern: increasing involvement in research, public presentations, contact with some of the more bizarre elements of the phenomenon, including psychic aspects, culminating in public and marital difficulties, and finally, remarriage and change in life and career goals. I am now at the point where many long-time researchers find themselves, bewildered by the mind-boggling array of \"evidence\" presented over years of investigation, much of it contradictory, and feeling that somehow, someone is standing in the background, enjoying a cosmic belly laugh at my expense. I think I have a clue as to the nature of the Joker, and the reasons behind its seemingly bizarre behavior. 'Lumpers, not Splitters' To gain a complete picture of the creature we are attempting to understand, we must step back and MICHAEL A. LEWIS resigned as state director for Wyoming on December 19, 1983, saying his businesses were monopolizing his time and that he was unable to apply sufficient resources to the continuation of his MUFONduties. But, perhaps more importantly, he also said that \"my research has taken me into a fringe area where I find little resonance among other UFO researchers. \"I am continuing my studies independently....! do not feel that my work is best carried out in an organizational structure.\" He submitted this article to explain his views, adding: \"My research has indicated that a certain degree of caution is necessary at this time, and I would like at least that message comunicated to other researchers. I have encountered a great deal of fanaticism recently, and lam afraid such a narrow-minded approach will be ultimately damaging.\" look at the entire scene, so as not to be limited a la blind men and elephants. We cannot afford to eliminate any potentially informative piece of the puzzle, no matter how seemingly bizarre. Therefore, we must, without exception, accept all proffered information without judgement and include that in our developing mental model of the phenomenon. We must be \"lumpers\" rather than \"splitters,\" generalists rather than specialists, attempting to synthesize some organization out of the hodgepodge of data constantly pounding our awareness. My puzzlement over the years has been brought about by the overwhelming contradictions in the data presented by UFO percipients from throughout the world. At first blush, it would seem that we are indeed being visited by creatures from another planet. That's what they tell us anyway. They even go so far as to name the planet, over and over again, in fact, with a different name supplied each time. We receive messages, urging us to \"Stop atomic testing. You are destroying the balance of the Universe,\" \"Prepare to join the Galactic Brotherhood\" and other equally limpid advice. We see spacemen in tight-fitting suits, sometimes wearing breathing apparatus, sometimes not, sometimes walking with difficulty or floating above the ground. We are taken aboard wondrous examples of flying devices, and shown 3-D maps of the UFOLKS' home planet(s). We see space ships stopped on lonely roads for nocturnal repairs and are offered celestial pancakes by their occupants. The DML's (Hynek's \"Damn Meandering Lights\") flit about our skies at night, purportedly examining our military facilities and nuclear power plants. All in all, the popular picture that emerges is one of covert surveillence of our planet by omnipotent other-wordly beings, intent on saving us from our own ignorant failings. Or so it would seem. Yet, if we examine ALL the evidence, we begin to feel that this explanation, as desirable as it may seem, is a bit too simplistic. It begins to become all too apparent that someone or something does indeed want us to (continued on next page) 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Lewis, Continued believe this fairy tale, and act accordingly. To this end they have succeeded. A goodly portion of the population of the United States (exact figures depending on the pollster you choose to follow) believe that the Earth is now or has been in the past, under the surveillence of extra-terrestrial intelligence. Thus, it is a fait accompli; if people believe a thing is so and act accordingly, the reality of the situation makes not one whit of difference. The evidence So, let's lay aside all the popular beliefs and professional prejudices and attempt to examine the evidence with an open, even childlike point of view. First, we are faced with numerous individuals who relate stories of contact with beings allegedly from another planet, arriving in vehicles of a technology beyond our understanding. These vehicles are capable of non- ballistic movement (right angle turns, instant stops, etc.), are able to disappear and evidently precede without visual or radar detection, and yet appear as solid and substantial as our more familiar aircraft. This obviously flies in the face of modern theories of physics and has resulted in outright rejection of the entire UFO subject by the scientific community. Yet, despite the lack of validation by the established authorities, the reports continue, as always by very reliable observers. We see numerous individuals who are in daily mental contact with self- claimed extraterrestrials, and who pass on extremely practical advice on the conduct of daily affairs, as well as predictions of future events, some disturbingly accurate, others curiously short of the mark. These individuals are extremely sincere in their belief of contact, and there is little doubt that they are correct. This situation has remained virtually unchanged for the past 25 years, with no signs of abating, and promising no increase in knowledge of the phenomenon in .years to come. Critters and mutilations This is an all too brief overview of the UFO phenomenon as we see it in this country.with a vast bell-shaped curve of reports, exhibiting wildly varying extremes on either end and an enormous mound of reports in the center. As we shall see, this mound is only the very tip of the iceberg of the entire range of activity that encompasses the true nature of the beast. On one extreme of the curve, we find numerous reports of \"Bigfoot\" type critters in close association with solid UFO reports. Many investigators dismiss these reports outright, as do \"legitimate\".scientists, as being too far out for inclusion in the UFO picture. And yet, again, the reports persist, showing a large hairy anthropoid in close association with classic UFOs, leaving ubiquitous footprints and occasional hairs and droppings, and always accompanied by a pungent, sulphurous odor. These creatures, too, seem to have the ability to appear and disappear at will, and to make their presence known without visual confirmation. They also seem to appear most often to young children and sexually mature women. Despite rejection by the mainstream of UFO research, Bigfeet are clearly closely associated with the phenomenon and must be considered in the total picture. Lying on the other extreme of the curve are cattle mutilations. (Oh, no! the cry arises.) Yes, there is a clear association of cattle mutilations with UFO appearances, as well as an intuitive similarity in the nature of the occurence with UFO and Bigfoot activity. Cattle mutilations always occur in remote locations, are conducted by means not understood by expert and layman alike and are actively debunked by the authorities. And yet they continue, even now, despite efforts by investigators, cattlemen and criminal authorities to discover their true nature and put a stop to it. To fully appreciate the full spectrum of the beast we are attempting to study, we must put it in a historical perspective. This phenomenon, or one indistinguishable from it, has been occurring throughout recorded history and probably long before. It has been given many different names and descriptions, as cultures have come and gone, but the underlying nature has remained remarkably consistent. The earliest recording of objects which can be interpreted as UFOs, of course is found in the Christian Bible. However it is apparent that pre- Christian people had knowledge of things in and of the Earth that we have either forgotten or chose, in a fit of religious fervor, to ignore. When Christianity began to be actively promoted in western Europe, it came into direct conflict with long established pagan beliefs, most of which were based around worship and active cooperation with earth-based deities. In Great Britain in particular, it became advantageous to locate and build shrines, churches and other religious centers on the same sites as earlier pagan structures, often building dolmens and other megalithic artifacts into the ediface. Thus, Christian practitioners not only neutralized the pagan influences, but also incorporated their energies into the following of the new religion. It is thought the megalithic constructions, such as Stonehenge and Avebury, may have served as power or energy accumulators, tapping into an energy which some psychics even now claim to be able to detect emanating from the standing stones. There certainly is a great deal of cultural information in support of this thesis, if one is willing to ignore the stigma of taking legends at face value. Many involved If this was indeed the case, it seems evident that a great many people were involved, over a long period of time, in applying their energies toward these constructions, some of them rivalling the pyramids in size and complexity, not to mention the activities that must have taken place when they were completed. They were undoubtedly \"power\" centers in many senses of the word. Over the years, under the urgings (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Lewis, Continued of the Christian missionaries, the purpose, and eventually the meaning, of the huge stone enigmas was forgotten, with only fairy tales and legends left to darkly hint at their previous importance. If they did serve a functional purpose in interposing between man and the Earth spirit, whatever its nature, that purpose was lost and no objects or rituals were developed to take their place. According to surviving legend and oral history, this was also a time replete with were-beings, little people, changlings and giants. Even in North America, aboriginal traditions tell of little people who lives in caves and came out to bother the locals with their mischievous tricks. The encounters related sound remarkably like modern accounts of alien visitations. It is evident that a consciousness, separate from man's, has existed on, and perhaps in, the Earth, at least as long as man has claimed existence as a separate species. And this consciousness has always displayed a certain degree of animosity toward the upstart newcomer. In earlier, simpler times, there existed varying degrees of cooperation, but that seems to have been abandoned, along with awareness of the existence of the earth-based entity. We seem now to be in a confrontatory position with something that is making itself very difficult to pin down and identify, let alone control. In fact, control seems to be slipping into the hands, or whatever, of the others, whatever \"they\" may be. Non-physical presence What we seem to be dealing with in the modern UFO, Bigfoot, Cattle Mutilation phenomenon is a physical manifestation of an essentially non- physical presence, which has existed on this Earth for untold millenia. It may be analagous in some ways to what has been described in a Biblical context as the Devil/Angel dichotomy, as Yin/Yang in Eastern philisophy and currently as the solid state vs. organic life form struggle, as described by Uri Geller and Andrija Puharich. All signs indicate that there is a very real presence making itself known to mankind by impinging on our uncon- scious in ways that turn conscious thought to what we call \"cosmic con- sciousness.\" Since this appears non- sensical to materially-minded, \"hard\" scientists, it has resulted in a split between the legitimate scientific community and popular belief and expectations, a split which has ominous implications for mankind. The scientific community is ill equipped to deal with this sort of non- physical phenomenon, and in the past, this same emphasis on other-worldly, faith-inspired dogma has resulted in the downfall and replacement of scientific, logical thought and development. This process may now even be accelerating due to the efforts of human individuals or groups attempting to actively increase the disparity between the common man and the p scientific/ political world. There are many indications that the UFO/Bigfoot/Cattle Mutilation occurrence may be, at least in part, disseminated by means of psychotronic devices, physical machines able to project images, ideas and false experiences directly into the unconscious or even conscious minds of the percipients. This is not necessarily to say that the events are totally under human control, but at the least, these individuals or groups may be taking advantage of an already existing condition. To what end, of course, we can only guess; but we can, at least, see the effects that the present condition is having on humankind now, and project that into a possible future. Unable to cope It is obvious that those whom we have traditionally considered to be experts and looked to as leaders are unable to cope with the current situation. They are unable to provide satisfactory answers to myriad pressing questions, and have chosen to ignore, or actively oppose the phenomenon, in hopes that it too should pass into history. The result is the erosion, in the eyes of the majority of the population, of traditional support structures, be they religious, political or scientific. We see a growing distrust of our political representatives, our scientific experts and our religious leaders. This is not due solely to their inability to address the questions posed by the UFO presence, but seems to be a . trend exacerbated by these questions. So, what are we as investigators and percipients to do? We must not allow ourselves to become blinded by the effect to such a degree as to be unable to determine the cause. We are not attempting to prove unequivocably the reality of UFOs. This is unnecessary, since the effect of that reality has already been achieved. What we must do is attempt to determine the source and satisfy ourselves as to the intentions of whoever or whatever is behind the phenomenon with regards to the evolutionary and cultural course of humanity. It may well be that by forming study groups and disseminating the information we discover, in a well intentioned attempt to inform the masses, we are facilitating the spread of influence of the phenomenon. And we may discover, all too late, that whoever is in control does not have our best interest at heart. The answers will not be found in the sky, nor on distant stars and planets. Nor will they be found by continued chasing about of distant flickering lights. The answers, if indeed there are any, will be found under our own noses, perhaps under our very own feet. We must explore that most curious of Unknown Objects, the human mind, if we are to discover the source of man's destiny. BIBLIOGRAPHY Brandon, Jim. Weird America New York: E.P.

The alleged encounter of a UFO and Soviet jets is the feature in the ENQUIRER'S January 31 issue. Five jets were destroyed and another one was damaged during the incident, according to researcher Henry Gris.

Widaman from assistant state director to the position of state director for Missouri to fill the vacancy created when R. Powell Adams resigned. Bruce has been a member of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis from its inception. He has been chairman of the vital St. Charles UFO Sub-Committee and recently became host chairperson for the pending MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium in St. Louis. Bruce headed a contingent of investigators from the St. Louis area to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln UFO Conference. This appointment is in recognition for 16 years of quietly performing positive investigations and research behind the scene. Starting as a teenager, Bruce is well-grounded in the techniques of ufology. His promotion will signify a trend in MUFON to elevate our younger, but mature and competent people to leadership positions. *** After losing two state directors during 1983, we are very cognizant that the pioneers in ufology won't be with us forever. Therefore, steps must be taken to support them with enthusiastic and reliable associates and colleagues who have \"earned their spurs.\" This factor was emphasized when Marilyn and Idabel Epperson telephoned to advise us of the passing of Paul A. Duich on December 31,1983, due to a heart condition. An aerospace engineer at North American Rockwell, Mr. Duich was one of the original members of NICAP and later MUFON in the Southern California section. May we express our sympathy to his widow, Louise Duich of Whittier, California. *** Tom Benson, state director for New Jersey, has become the recipient of a very fine team of investigators and researchers when the two following gentlemen joined MUFON: Gerald J. Miskar, an English teacher with a masters degree, who has become a research specialist, and Fred Schaefer, a field investigator. Both live in Clementon, New Jersey. Kenneth McLean, state director for Wyoming, has announced that the 1984 P.R.O. — UFO Contactee Conference is scheduled for June 14 to 16, with optionable workshops on June 11-13 for early registrants. This annual summer conference will be held at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by WaltAndras E.

San Antonio is one of the unique cities in the U.S. for visitors and tourists. Plan to see the famous River Walk, the Alamo, the Spanish Missions and the numerous other sightseeing attractions that abound in the culture of this historical, but modem city (10th largest in the U.S.). *** Prentice-Hall Publishing Company has announced that it will release the book Clear Intent, by Larry Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood, on May 15, starting their publicity campaign on the west coast. I feel confident that the Freedom of Information Act documents published will significantly stir the American public's interest in the UFO phenomenon and the \"Cosmic Watergate\" that has been so prevalent since the 1947-1948 era. We in MUFON are very proud of Larry Fawcett, assistant state director for Connecticut, and Barry J. Greenwood, state section director in Massachusetts, for their outstanding contribution to ufology and for enlightening the public about the government cover-up on UFOs. *** It is a pleasure to welcome Bill Pitts back into an active role in ufology as the state director for Arkansas. Bill originally served as state director from 1976 until 1980, when he recommended that Bill Leet assume this responsibility. With the passing of Bill Leet, Mr. Pitts volunteered to fill this void. BILL PITTS Bill Pitts is best known in ufology for sponsoring the Fort Smith UFO Conference in 1975 in Fort Smith, Arkansas on the theme (UFO) United For Objectivity. This was the first serious attempt to get all of the UFO organizations together so that working relationships could exist between APRO, CUFOS, GSW, MUFON and NICAP. Richard F. Haines presented a formal resolution titled A Joint Resolution aimed at the theme of the conference, but essentially directly at the participants. NICAP has since passed into oblivion. It has been difficult to detect any improvement in the cooperation by APRO since 1975, when Dr. Haines' resolution was endorsed by the five attending UFO organizations. Bill Pitts' dream has now become a reality with the formation of the North American UFO Federation (NAUFOF) directed by Dr. Haines and spearheaded by SBI, CUFOS and MUFON. Mr. Pitts' deep insight into the problems of UFO cooperation were readily apparent in 1975 after I reviewed the correspondence involved in the planning for his ambitious undertaking. Bill must be commended for anticipating the future of ufology and taking positive action to solve the problems confronting the field. (continued on page 19)"}]
