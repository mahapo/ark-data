Who knows how extraterrestrials \"ought to\" behave? Such thinking is presumption, not science. The scientific skeptics reject the UFO data, seeing it as an affront to science. Others accept the UFO data but reject the extraterrestrial hypothesis^in favor of \"other dimensions,\" or what- ever, showing an all-too-eager readiness to assume that \"science\" doesn't work and they know better how to \"explain\" UFOs. The former de- monstrate a certain dogmatic skein in science and a protective defensive- ness about it. The latter demonstrate a fundamentally anti-scientific, ra- tionalistic attitude. Although totally speculative, the simplest assumption that can be made to bridge the \"behavior gap\" is that extraterrestrials have a su- perior understanding of how to control and apply natural phenomena, physical and possibly also mental. This is not a far-fetched or unreason- able assumption. What may seem to us to be \"paranormal\" (not under- stood by our science) could be perfectly \"normal\" to them. The only way to find out is to gather more and better objective data carefully de- scriptive of what is occurring. Then our scientific concepts and theories may have to be expanded gradually to encompass the facts. The factual horse must precede the theoretical cart, regardless of the driver's per-, sonal preferences.

Scott Rogo book, The Tujunga Can- yon Contacts, Rogo makes a fascinat- ing remark in his concluding chapter: \"Many contemporary ufologists - in- cluding J. Allen Hynek, Jacques Vallee, Ann Druffel, Jerome Clark and Ivan Sanderson - have given up on the idea that UFOs are some sort of nuts-and- bolts craft visiting our world from some distant galaxy. Quite frankly, these in- vestigators have come to realize that UFOs and their occupants just don't behave like alien visitors to our realm.\" (Emphasis mine). From the assurance of his state- ment I assume Rogo has checked this carefully. He must have gone to the United States Bureau of Standards to take out and study the official, standard Alien Visitors from a Distant Galaxy who are in storage there — on file, as it were - in order to compare them with reported UFO occupants. The rest fol- lows logically. He found they don't match. The official Bureau of Stan- dards Alien Visitors are quite different from UFO occupants, but unfortunate- ly he doesn't explain these differences in any detail. However, from recent writings on the subject one can guess that a great many other UFO researchers have made this same trip to the Bureau of Standards, examined and interviewed the real nuts-and-bolts extraterrestrials and found they differ greatly from UFO occupants in what they can do and why they do it. For one thing, they have very different technological abilities. UFO occupants can do many strange things, such as dematerializing before our eyes - almost as if they turned off the lasers powering a holo- graph - that standard extraterrestrials evidently have never learned to do. Rogo believes that \"abductions really do occur, but they are produced joint- ly by the minds of the witness (sic) in- volved through the materializing abili- ties possessed by the Phenomenon.\" The mere extraterrestrials at the Bureau of Standards evidently can neither ma- terialize nor dematerialize nor become involved with the minds of abductees. They simply do not yet have the tech- nology to do so, or so Rogo seems to be claiming. Finally, of course, UFOs aren't even held together with nuts and bolts as is the standard extrater- restrial machine on file at the Bureau. I have read many objections to the idea that the Bureau of Standards' extraterrestrials are responsible for the UFO phenomenon, though they might have been in the 1950's. Each objec- tion is a demonstration of anthropo- morphic reasoning. Rogo quotes Dr. J. Allen Hynek: \"These beings are re- ported to have ... hands that don't have flexible fingers that we possess. It is hard to imagine an advanced techno- logy developing from a race of people who have clawlike hands. How could they manipulate transistors, for in- stance, or perform fine adjustments, or do the kind of delicate work it takes to make machines run? Another problem is that the occupants appear to be so completely at home in our gravity and atmosphere. If they were physical en- tities coming from different planets, you would expect them to have diffi- culty in that regard.\" Leaving aside for the time being the cases that have surfaced since that 1977 statement, and which describe UFO occupants as possessing long, thin, flexible fingers, and showing dif- ficulties walking in our environment, are these objections even relevant? Are the figures with claw-like hands living beings who develop and manipulate transistors? Who knows? I assume the Bureau of Standards extraterrestrials must be, each and every one, extreme- ly adept at dialing radios. Are the ap- parently air-breathing UFO entities which are seen in our environment for short periods of time actually alive? Is this any stranger than Japanese pearl fishermen who operate so gracefully without gear 50 feet below the ocean's surface? Who knows? I surely don't. I am afraid that the nuts-and-bolts extraterrestrial in the drawer at the Bureau of Standards is indeed filled with straw. We have set him up and then decided that he is incompetent to do the various things that UFO occu- pants are reported to be able to do. Since our straw man is so dreadfully limited, we have replaced him with Cosmic Control Systems, a medieval demonology with good and bad de- mons, even Rogo's \"Phenomenon,\" the latter differing from other mystical or psychic phenomena largely in that its first letter is imposingly upper case. Your standard extraterrestrial beings, able to \"get here from there,\" have lately been granted an arbitrary range of nuts-and-bolts skills slightly in ad- vance of Neil Armstrong's. And since that doesn't take care of much of the UFO phenomena as reported, we have decided to strike down this obviously straw-filled quantity and to replace it with more comfortable — and preten- tious — \"paranormal\" concepts. I am certain that much of the tech- nology we take for granted today, in- cluding, for example, such techniques as hypnosis, would appear \"paranor- mal\" to Cro-Magnon man. \"Paranor- mal\" may be nothing more than a catch-all phrase for techniques and mechanisms that have not yet been mastered. Since much of the UFO oc- cupant's behavior during abduction has overtones of hypnosis as we cur- rently understand and practice it our- selves, what other techniques might be known by advanced extraterrestrial beings? One of the simplest and safest de- ductions we can make about how ex- traterrestrial visitors might behave is that they might investigate us. These investigations could involve actual physical examinations of human spec- imens. These examinations could be (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(\"Paraphysical, continued) general with one or two typical speci- mens standing in as types, or they could be highly individualized, requir- ing the variety of many specimens. Who knows? At any rate this seems to be happening and so far as it goes it's not totally outrageous. Dr. Robert Jastrow once made a remark that I remember imperfectly, but the gist of it is this: \"If the UFO phenomenon is actually an extraterres- trial probe of some sort, they have to be technologically greatly in advance of us. And if this is true, whatever they do will not make complete sense to us. If it does seem completely logi- cal and consistent it is probably not extraterrestrial in origin.\" In other words only if their behavior seems \"paranormal\" are we possibly dealing with true extraterrestrials. The types down in Washington in the Bureau of Standards are obviously frauds. Proba- bly they are just disguised Russians left over from the Cold War, nuts and bolts and all. All this work to invent \"cosmic control systems,\" to update medieval demonology, even to revivify mori- bund Jungian archetypes has been, though creative, beside the point. We must start again in a simple way by trying to decide, so far as we can, exactly what has happened in each UFO case, and to postpone for the moment the human need to give the event meaning. The UFO pheno- menon has always eluded efforts to tie it down, to give it limits, and the re- sulting frustration has led to a simple fallacy: If we can name it, we have un- derstood it. Calling the UFO pheno- menon a \"control system\" - defining it in terms of one man's guess about its ultimate purpose — is an attempt to get at least one conceptual rope around it. Equally human and touching is the attempt to merge the phenomenon with traditional earthly concepts of good and evil. We must finally admit the proba- bility that life exists elsewhere in our galaxy, and that some of it is probably far in advance of us. If this is so, and we should one day receive a visit — or, indeed, currently be receiving visits - it will be easier for us to invent and MILITARY SECRECY: SAILORS, SOLDIERS, AND AIRMEN By Richard Hall If UFOs have been sighted four or more times from one U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, how many other suppressed military UFO sightings are there? This issue was raised on the weekend of the Smithsonian Institution UFO symposi- um in September. Four UFO organiza- tions worked together in an unprece- dented display of cooperation to high- light the problem of prying loose high- ly significant UFO sightings known to be withheld from the public. At a press conference sponsored by the Fund for UFO Research, Sep- tember 5, Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee (chairman of the Fund and MUFON Maryland State Director) called for the government to release sightings to re- sponsible civilian groups after screen- ing for proper security clearance. Sup- porting him on the panel were Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the Center for UFO Studies; Peter A. Gersten, at- torney representing Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS); and Stanton Friedman, all of whom cited examples of suppressed military reports. That same evening Dr. Hynek lec- tured at the University of Maryland, after which Maccabee, Friedman, and the present writer formed a panel for further discussion and audience ques- tions. A dramatic confirmation of the point came from the audience when, in response to a poll, a man identified himself as a former Air Force radar controller who had tracked a UFO at an east coast base in the 1950's and vectored jet interceptors to its location. The pilots detected it on their airborne radar and saw \"a string of blue lights\" that made a sharp turn and sped away. polish earthly, though \"paranormal\" or even quasi-religious \"explanations\" for what we observe than to under- stand the technologies, values, and methods of another world. Shortly afterwards, a team of in- vestigators from Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, arrived, interrogated everyone, and confiscated all of the records. He was instructed \"not to talk about it for 10 years..\" On the same program, I summa- rized what was known to date about several UFO sightings on board the air- craft carrier U.S.S. Franklin D. Roose- velt (CVA-42), a cooperative investiga- tion project by MUFON, CAUS, and the Fund for UFO Research. A pioneer in this investigation was Ralph C. DeGraw in his now-defunct The UFO Examiner. The prime informant, Ches- ter C. Grusinski, was a sailor on the carrier in September 1958 during a shakedown cruise from Florida to Cuba, when (he says) he was among numerous witnesses to a UFO with windows, with humanoid figures out- lined behind them, that approached and hovered near the ship. Troubled by the experience and personal prob- lems, Grusinski had later gone AWOL, casting doubt on his credibility as a witness. However, his request for doc- umentation of the incident has been open and honest, and has gotten re- sults. In'the process, Grusinski wrote to many UFO groups and individual in- vestigators asking for help. (Anyone who has information bearing on the case is invited to share it with MUFON and CAUS so that the investigation can be coordinated.) We have been able to obtain enough confirmatory evi- dence to suggest that the case is an im- portant one. CAUS has filed Freedom of Information Act lawsuits, and an effort is being made to obtain state- ments from other officers and enlisted men. The same carrier had been involved in a UFO sighting on September 20, 1952, during \"Operation Mainbrace\" (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(Military Secrecy, continued) 1952, during \"Operation Mainbrace\" NATO maneuvers in the North Atlan- tic. Several ships and aircraft of the fleet reported separate UFO sightings. On board CVA-42, witnesses saw and photographed a silvery spherical ob- ject \"moving rapidly.\" Although the incident was reported by Capt. Ed- ward J. Ruppelt, former chief of Pro- ject Blue Book (page 257 of his book), no intelligence report or film analysis has ever been released. (See also The UFO Evidence,?. 162) Through Grusinski's efforts to confirm the 1958 incident, another separate sighting recently came to light. A retired Navy r commander who had served on CVA-42 had not been aboard during the Cuba cruise, but had been involved in a radar-visual UFO sighting during a Mediterranean cruise in 1953: (Documentation has been provided to the Fund for UFO Research.) The same source volunteered that while on active duty in 1958 as a jet pilot in- structor at Pensacola, Florida, he had been asked to investigate - and had seen — a UFO. This case is not on pub- lic record either. A popular magazine (unidentified clipping) has provided another lead, yet to be confirmed, that about 90 crew members of CVA-42 were in- volved in still another UFO sighting on May 1, 1975, off the coast of Italy. A Lt/j.g. Arthur Pezzano is quoted as saying that a UFO emerged from the water, flew around the ship, then plunged back into the water. Allegedly, it was grayish with portholes on its rim. Reports from the Fall 1958 period, during the Cuba cruise, suggest that more than one UFO sighting oc- curred, including strong rumors of a sighting at Guantanamo Bay about the same time. Thus, four (minimum) to seven separate UFO sightings are in- volved. At the end of September, Dr. Peter Rank, a radiologist at Methodist Hos- pital in Madison, Wisconsin (Board Member of the Fund for UFO Re- search) visited Washington, D.C., and met with a group of UFO researchers in the area. He described his experien- ces as an Army flight surgeon in Korea, with his pilots reporting frequent UFO sightings.:They were interrogated by Air Force investigators who had large books of UFO pictures for comparison (something many of us have heard of before). The investigators refused to discuss what they knew, and after a while the Army pilots stopped report- ing their sightings which, they said, were only going down \"the sink,\" their term for the taciturn Air Force inves- tigators who would not share informa- tion with their supposed colleagues. This self-defeating policy of alien- ating potentially good witnesses is not unprecedented. In his revealing book about the \"military mind\" as applied to UFOs, Capt. Ruppelt discussed at length the patch-up work he had to do in order to persuade the best qualified witnesses to report their sightings to the Air Force. Previous investigators had insulted their intelligence by care- fully questioning them while pretend- ing that nothing of any consequence was going on. It was a one-way street; all information going in and none coming out. The pilots, engineers, ra- dar operators, arid other trained per- sonnel who knew they had seen some- thing unusual resented being treated like children. Ruppelt himself revealed for the first time many military cases that otherwise would not be known to the public. Major Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (Ret.), who has been much maligned for his insistence that the Air Force is keeping important UFO se- crets, has in fact been more correct than his detractors all along. The evi- dence continues to mount that the im- portant military cases known to the public (radar, photographs, physical evidence) are only the tip of the pro- verbial iceberg. My conclusion, based on informa- tion from a wide variety of military and scientific sources over a 25-year period, is that we have only scratched the surface of suppressed military UFO sightings, some of a highly spec- tacular nature. Until witnesses fael free to talk without fear of reprisal-, we will be left with incomplete documenta- tion. We may \"know\" by our own lights that we are right, but we won't be able to prove it. Q , . CLOSE ENCOUNTER CASE UNDER INVESTIGATION What may turn out to be a CE-1I case was reported about 4:20 a.m. on the morning of September 11 in An- derson, South Carolina, by Jerry McAlister, an electrician. The case is under investigation by MUFON and the Center for UFO Studies. A com- plete report will be published later. According to preliminary informa- tion, McAlister and his wife were awakened by a loud noise which they thought might be a helicopter crashing, and saw from their window a huge ellipse or disc with windows hovering over the trees. The UFO tipped up and moved away toward the NNE. The Mc- Alisters suffered eye discomfort from the brilliant light. The sheriffs department was called and deputies came to the scene. Early reports disagree as to what they saw, but some at least saw an unexplained distant light. People in the neighbor- hood than watched a bright light in the NNE for over 2 hours, using a tele- scope and binoculars. Since Venus rose in that direction shortly after 3:00 a.m. and would have been about 20 degrees above the horizon at the time of the sighting, the \"distant light\" may have been Venus. Don Roberts, MUFON State Director for South Carolina, is investi- gating, and his report is expected to clarify presently uncertain features of the case. NEW SAC BASE SIGHTING The Center for UFO Studies is in- vestigating sightings August 20, 1980, by security police at Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming. The reports and wit- ness statements were received from the Commander, Headquarters 90th Stra- tegic Missile Wing (SAC) in a letter dated September 2, who said the Air Force so far had been unable to ac- count for the sightings.

Time: 0230 Central European Time. Locale: Near Haselbach (Southern Thuringia), East Germany. Witnesses: Herr Oskar Linke (48), may- or of Gleimershausen; his 11-year- old Daughter Gabrielle. Closest Proximity to Entities: 15 me- ters (about 33 feet). Investigators: Antony Terry, for the London Sunday-Graphic; Dr. Leon Davidson, White Plains, N.Y. (1958-59). HumCat Classification: Serial #0183, Type B (entities seen entering UFO). Translations from German: Dr. David- son, Douwe Bosga, and Lex Mebane Background Oskar Linke was born on June 15, 1901, in Breslau (now Wroclaw , t Po- land). At the time of his UFO encoun- ter in June 1950, he was mayor of the small East German village of Gleimer- shausen, in Southern Thuringia, ap- proximately eight kilometers west southwest of Meinengen, near the West German frontier. Herr Linke had four children in 1950: Gabrielle (11), Nor- bert (9), Ossi (3), and ababy.Hanna. Because he feared the Russians would learn that he had seen what he believed was one of their manned secret mis- siles, Herr Linke fled from East Ger- many into West Berlin on April 20, 1951, with hii family, which included his aged mother. More than a year lat- er, something prompted Herr Linke to report his 1950 sighting, for on July 1, 1952, he made a sworn statement about his experience to a West Berlin notary, Dr. Oskar Krause. The press heard of the sighting through the West Berlin police, and almost immediate- ly the story was a sensation, appearing in newspapers around the world. There seems to have been no of- ficial Air Force inquiry into the Linke UFO sighting for it cannot be located in the archives of Project Blue Book; nevertheless, the former East German claimed in 1959 that among the many intelligence people who interrogated him in West Berlin in 1952 was an un- identified American colonel. Linke's story, as told to Antony Terry of the London Sunday-Graphic, was published on July 6,1952; within days the United Press and the North American Newspaper Alliance had their own stories on the wires. A first- hand account was published in the West Berlin newspaper, Nacht-Depesche (Night Talk), issue #188 (date of pub- lication unknown, but most likely within the first week of July 1952). Herr Linke's sighting was also briefly mentioned in some early books on \"flying saucers.\" Desmond Leslie recounted it in his half of George Adamski's 1953 pot-boiler, \"Flying Saucers Have Landed,\" and Harold Wilkins provided a summary in his 1954 book, \"Flying Saucers on the At- tack.\" In 1966, a particularly error- strewn account, citing NAN A as the source, appeared in Frank Edwards' book, \"Flying Saucers -- Serious Busi- ness.\" Among other omissions and dis- tortions, none of these sources pro- vided the correct date or time of Herr Linke's encounter. The following summary of Linke's 1950 sighting is compiled from Antony Terry's Sunday-Graphic story; from the account in Nacht-Depesche; and, most importantly from the witness's own first-hand account as written to Dr. Davidson in 1959. We are indebted to Leon Davidson for providing us with these valuable data. The Sighting of June 17,1950 Herr Linke and his 11-year-old daughter Gabrielle set out early from Gleimershausen for Haselbach by motorcycle, with Gabrielle in the side car. It was 2:30 a.m. and the first ves- tiges of dawn were apparent in the east. They were several kilometers outside Haselbach when a tire blew out, so Herr Linke and his daughter continued on foot, pushing the machine. Something in a field about 150 yards away caught Gabrielle's eye: \"Look there, father,\" she called out, \"two deer in Gopfert's Meadow!\" Her father, thinking that he might be able to catch one, left his daughter with the disabled motorcycle at the roadside and made his way through the brush and small fir trees toward the field. \"As I approached the deer up to about 80 meters through the hilly field,\" he told the Nacht-Depesche reporter in 1952, \"I recognized (they were) not deer, but two human figures. They were dressed in heavy garments, like people wear in polar regions.\" These garments, he said, appeared to be made of \"a shimmering, metallic sub- stance.\" At a distance of about 50 yards from the figures, he watched them as they bent over, \"as if studying some- thing on the ground.\" Believing that they were Russians, he made his way cautiously to a distance of about 15 yards. \"Peering over a small ridge, I noticed a large object, which I judged to be 40 to 50 feet across.\" He said that it was in the shape of an oval warming pan or flask (not a frying pan), without a handle, and stood about 8 feet high. \"There were two rows of holes along the sides, about a foot in diameter. Each row was rough- ly a foot and a half from the next. Out of the top of the metallic object rose"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Vest Gemany East Germany t> Morkluhl lW«\"rodl Area of large scale *ap.

One of the men had a light on his chest that blinked on and off at intervals. The light appeared to be on a small box-like device on his chest. Linke continued to observe the men and the machine at close range for 25 minutes. All this while Gabrielle stood alone by the road. Finally she called out to her father. \"I was now alarmed by my daughter, who had re- mained some distance back,\" Linke told Antony Terry. \"The sound must have reached the two figures, for they rushed back to the object, clambored rapidly up the side to the 'conning tower,' and disappeared inside.\" In one of his letters to Dr. Davidson, in which he responded to a question of whether the figures were human (men- schlich), or humanoid (menschenahn- lich), in appearance, Herr Linke said: \"It is difficult to say whether the two forms who stood in front of the object and then flew off were men. I would say they could also have been other creatures since their (manner of) loco- motion was a glide, similar to that of bears.\" With the disappearance of the two beings inside the \"conning tower,\" other things quickly began to happen: \"The outer edge of the warming pan, in which the holes were sunk, now started to glow,\" he told reporter Terry. Other sources described this glow as being red and green. \"At the same time I heard a slight hum,\" Linke added. As the glow and the sound in- tensified, Linke saw that the \"conning tower\" was retracting into the main body of the object — or, rather, that the object itself was rising up around its central core, for it could now be seen emerging at the bottom. Exhaust flames were being emitted from around the edge. Linke noted, \"From the swirling effect of the glowing 'ex- haust,' I got the impression the whole object was spinning like a top. It seemed to be resting on the cylin- drical piece which had sunk through the object and was now protruding from the bottom and standing on the ground. The 'warming pan,' with its glowing outside ring of flame, was now some feet off the earth.\" According to his account in Nacht- Depesche, Linke said that \"a powerful cold airstream came from the object, which caused the grain in a neighbor- ing field to flatten down.\" The object was now completely airborne and hov- ered briefly at about 100 feet; Linke could see that \"the cylinder on which it had rested had now disappeared in- side the center and reappeared through the top. The rate of ascent now became much greater, and at the same time my daughter and I heard a whistling sound, rather like the noise made by a falling bomb, but not nearly so loud.\" Nacht- Depesche quoted him as describing the sound \"like a siren.\" Gabrielle, who was watching from the road, said: \"I heard a very loud noise coming from the meadow and I saw how a burning disc flew up into the air and disappeared toward Hild- burghausen.\" Her father said, \"It rose in a horizontal position, swerved away toward a nearby village, and disap- peared , still gaining height over the hills and forest toward Stockheim.\" Ac- cording to the map Herr Linke sent to Leon Davidson, Stockheim is situated about ten kilometers south-southwest of Haselbach, in the West German sec- tor. Herr Linke and his daughter ex- amined the area where the object had been and found \"a circular depression, evidently freshly made, where the earth had been driven down. This was exactly the shape of the 'conning tower',\" he told Antony Terry. Later that day, several local people told Herr Linke that they had seen some aerial phenomenon they took for \"a comet\" early that morning. George Derbst, a shepherd, was about a mile and a half from Linke's position when he thought he saw \"a comet bounce off the earth.\" A sawmill watchman told Linke he had seen what he thought was \"a low- flying comet\" flash away from the hill where Herr Linke and his daughter saw the object. Still believing that he had seen a secret Russian missile and its pilots, Herr Linke said little about his sighting, fearing reprisals. But as time wore on, word of it began to spread and he be- came fearful for his safety. \"I was nev- er taken notice of by the Russians,\" he wrote to Dr. Davidson, \"but as it be- 'came \"known among the people that I 'had seen something, I fled with my family to the west.\" It was not until after he resettled in West Berlin that Herr Linke learned about \"flying sau- cers.\" Comments and Conclusions If there were any doubts about the real identity of Herr Linke and his credentials, as presented in the 1952 news reports, Leon Davidson put them to rest in a series of written inquiries begun in 1958. On September 24, he wrote to the Berlin Bureau of Justice requesting the address of Dr. Oskar Krause; upon receipt of that informa- tion, he wrote to Dr. Krause on Octo- ber 9 requesting verification from the notary of Herr Linke's deposition of July 1, 1952. The following reply, in part, was received from Dr. Krause in a letter dated October 13,1958: the document certified by me on 1 July 1952 came from a Hen Oskai Lin- ke. He was at that time not known to me by his appearance, and he therefore identified himself through the presenta- tion of his identity card with photo- graph and data from the Police Chief of Berlin ...

Richard Greenwell The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome. Status Report II: New Sources, New Data. By Leonard H. Stringfield. Se- guin; Texas: MUFON, 1980. According to my Dictionary of Behavioral Science (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1973),a syndrome is a \"clus- ter of symptoms indicative of a clinical entity.\" In examining Stringfield's new publication, it becomes quickly ap- parent that a \"clinical entity\" is in- deed involved - the \"symptoms\" in this case being the many reports re- ceived by Stringfield on the recovery of crashed UFOs and their small hu- manoid occupants. The question is: Does this clinical entity represent Tac- tual occurrences, or does it represent a series of hoaxed stories emanating from different sources? First, I suppose I should confess that I am, in principle, very skeptical about such accounts. I do not even think that the federal government has a \"secret study\" concerning UFOs, or is even interested in them — much less \"recovering\" them. There are several reasons for this, the main one being that such secret studies, particularly those involving \"recovery\" incidents, would necessarily involve hundreds of specialists in such physical science areas as metallurgy, aerodynamics, celestial mechanics, electrical engineering, and probably several areas of physics; and, in. the biological sciences, physiology, neurology, genetics, internal medicine, and physical anthropology, including osteology and biomechanics. Specialists in comparative and physiological lin- guistics would probably also be in- volved. Have any of these specialists stepped forward to identify themselves publicly? None have had doubts about their secret involvement? Nobody has been tempted by the subsequent fame and fortune? The answer to these questions, regrettably, is \"no.\" Maybe, instead, they have spoken to family and close friends, and the \"secret\" has become so widespread that it is common knowledge in scien- tific circles? Again, the answer is \"no.\" Norman Hilberry,a nuclear scientist at the University of Arizona, was Associ- ate Director of the Metallurgical Project (popularly known as the Manhattan Project) during World War II, and I have often discussed with him that sim- ilar situation. Although the public was . not aware of the atomic bomb develop- ment, centered at The University of Chicago, many scientists knew that \"something big\" was up. Hilberry and Co., by his own account, stole too much specialized equipment and too many top people from too many other institutions to keep the operation total- ly under wraps for long. More recently, we find another example. On August 22, 1980, Secre- tary of Defense Harold Brown an- nounced the existence of a highly secret project called \"Stealth,\" which would eventually make possible the penetration of Soviet air defenses by U.S. bombers and Cruise missiles with- out initial detection. The technology involves special coating materials, which reportedly disperses radar beams, and methods for making air- craft and missiles less detectable by Soviet heat sensing equipment. At a Washington news conference, Secre- tary Brown stated: \"We would have preferred to keep the secret longer,\" but that \"the circle of people know- ledgeable about the program has wid- ened, partly because of the increased size of the effort ...\" So, even in 1980 we have a project of immense strategic importance to the Western world, and only three years in operation, being publicly revealed by the nation's prin- pal military official in order to avoid a \"leak.\" (Continued on next page) (Herr Linke, continued) which he confirms that his father was indeed the mayor of that town until 1951, when he fled with his family to West Berlin. He told Davidson that his father had been ill, but that he would reply directly to any further communi- cations. There followed over the course of the next year an exchange of six let- ters between Leon Davidson and Oskar Linke in which a number of specific questions were answered by the form- er East German mayor. All of the per- tinent points touched on in those let- ters have been incorporated into this report. Missing from the case file, un- fortunately, is a copy of the original deposition - although Dr. Davidson had requested a copy from both Herr Linke and Dr. Krause, he never received it. There is always, of course, too lit- tle information about any UFO exper- ience of special interest to satisfy the demanding investigator, and it is no different in the case of Herr Linke's experience. We have not even had the opportunity to meet the witness face to face. But the information that we have managed to compile argues favor- ably for the credibility of the witness, and the reality of his experience, as he perceived it. The internal consistency of Herr Linke's story, and the unpre- cedented details it contains (such as the unusual embarkation of the UFO) argue persuasively in favor of its au- thenticity. In short, it must be reasonably concluded, on the basis of the avail- able information, that Herr Linke wit- nessed a phenomenal occurrence in June of 1950, involving the appearance on the ground and in flight of an ex- traordinary vehicle and its operators. Until further information emerges that casts doubt upon the data already as- sembled, this sighting should be in- cluded among the list of unexplained UFO reports."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Retrievals, continued) And so it would be with a secret UFO project. Instead, in the String- field scenarios, we generally find a mixed bag of junior military personnel who somehow managed to be at the right place at the right time. We must further envision that, while none of the senior specialists have talked, the junior people have been permitted to observe highly secret material, material which they had no business seeing, and, further still, that they are talking about it. Let us now examine the status of Stringfield's 10 new informants: * U.S. Army Warrant Officer * U.S. Air Force Sergeant * \"in Army Intelligence\" * U.S. Air Force Major * U.S. Air Force Sergeant * \"former CIA employee\" * medical doctor * U.S. Army Private First Class * U.S. Air Force \"radar specialist\" * U.S. Air Force Major Hardly a group I would pick to keep my national secrets! And we even have, in one case (A5), a sergeant be- ing shown a Top Secret UFO retrieval document by an Air Force General. Other subtle telltale clues are notice- able to those with a critical eye, such as in Case Al, where a UFO was sup- posedly picked-up prior to crashing by \"special tracking equipment\" at the Mount Palomar Observatory in Cali- fornia (Mount Palomar has no such tracking equipment). In Case A9, the U.S. Air Force \"radar specialist\" (who was part of a \"small select group of radar specialists\" to be shown a retrie- val movie) was actually only 20 years old. And so forth. (For those interested in other problems with these kinds of stories, see my entry \"Conspiracy Theories\" in The Encyclopedia of UFOs, Doubleday, 1980). If these accounts are not true, why are people reporting them only to Stringfield? (I am assured that String- field is completely honest, and is as puzzled by the accounts as anybody else.) According to some, the reason is Stringfield's book Situation Red, The UFO Siege (Doubleday, 1977). How- ever, dozens of other books were pub- lished on the topic in the 1970s, and 10 none of the authors have, to my know- ledge, been bombarded with these kinds of stories. To put things in a clear- er historical perspective, seven repre- sentative books by major authors, with their corresponding publication years, are listed below: The UFO Experience: A Scientific In- quiry by J. Allen Hynek, Chicago: Henry Regnery (1972) Aliens From Space: The Real Story of Unidentified Flying Objects by Donald E. Keyhoe, Garden City: Doubleday (1973) UFOs Explained by Philip J. Klass, New York: Random House (1974) The UFO Controversy in America by David M. Jacobs, Bloomington: Indi- ana University Press (1975) The Invisible College: What a Group of Scientists has Discovered about UFO Influence on the Human Race by Jacques Vallee, New York: E. P. Dut- ton(1975) The Hynek UFO Report by J. Allen Hynek, New York: Dell (1977) Situation Red, The UFO Siege! by Leonard H. Stringfield, Garden City: Doubleday (1977) One can observe that all the in- formants of recovered saucers and oc- cupants by-passed no other than \"Mr. UFO\" himself, astronomer Hynek (in 1972); the famous Major Keyhoe (in 1973), this even though Keyhoe had been battling a supposed U.S. govern- ment UFO conspiracy for about 20 years; UFO debunker Klass (in 1974), who many would love to prove wrong and who would probably give his eye teeth to get information on UFO hard- ware for his magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology;histomn Jacobs (in 1975), who completed no less than a Ph.D. dissertation on the UFO topic; and, for those whose imaginations may have slipped completely over the edge of reality, Jacques Vallee (in 1975). But the informants had another chance to decide who to pick because Hynek published a second UFO book in 1977, the same year as Stringfield's book. However, people \"in the know,\" it seems, all decided on one person: Len Stringfield. The reason for this, I have been told, is that Stringfield specifically raised the issue in his book. It is true that nine pages (four percent) of Stringfield's book are allocated to such retrievals. Whether or not this would be sufficient cause for all the infor- mants \"in the know\" to approach him and only him, is, I suppose, for every individual to decide for him/herself. But before doing so, it might be wise to look at the above list of books again, and to remember when the epic sci- ence-fiction movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind was released. The movie probably had a more profound effect on the national psyche than is realized, and, at its climactic ending, it depicts small humanoids with large heads, very much like our supposed bodies hidden away in government labs. The movie was released in late 1977, in time for the Christmas mar- let, the same year as Stringfield's book. Could this movie, which surely every- one with even a passing interest in UFOs saw, have been the triggering mechanism? Would some individuals who saw the movie and read String- field's book decide to have some fun? Stringfield himself states (Case Al) that the September 1977 informant \"was my first encounter with a first- hand witness.\" It is true that the movie had not been released by September, but considerable publicity about it was underway. If all these reports are hoaxes coming from different sources, why are they so similar? The key may be in Stringfield's own use of the word syn- drome in his title, which means: \"a cluster of symptoms indicative of a clinical entity.\" The \"clinical entity,\" in this case, may be a result of several kinds of socio-psychological pheno- mena, influenced by media imagery, and facilitated by a receptive target in- dividual. Maybe I am wrong. If one day it is revealed that crashed UFOs and their occupants have been recovered, I promise never to write about UFOs again. But then I won't have to. They will no longer be unidentified. MUFON 1030LDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN.TX 78155"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"RESPONSE TO GREENWELL CRITIQUE By Leonard H. Stringfield I wish to commend J. Richard Greenwell for his objective critique of my monograph, \"The UFO Crash/Re- trieval Syndrome.\" Certainly his opin- ions, tactfully presented, should be carefully considered as we all seek the truth in this crucial issue alleging that crashed alien craft and occupants have been retrieved and some secretly pre- served and studied. Indeed, we must all ponder all factors of this seeming fantasy. To get to the crux, either most of my firsthand informants are telling the truth about their observations and/or experiences, or they all have been ma- nipulated to deceive me for an ulterior purpose, or they are all expert falsifiers to deceive me for the fun of it. What- ever the case, it all boils down to a simple fact: you can't be half pregnant. Seriously, we must also consider that even if one informant is telling me the whole truth, then my rhetorical \"syndrome\" may deserve more profes- (^sional attention. At this writing, I have 19 firsthand independent sources, each who seems to be of reliable character, and for the most part, hold responsible jobs. I also realize that to convince the scientific community, I must produce the tangible evidence — the actual alien cadaver - not anecdotal testimonials or a document or photograph which can be easily faked. If official secrecy prevails, as I be- lieve it probably does and will in my lifetime, I will never prove the data I present. Even if I had the best informa- tion available such as bona fide docu- ments and photos, I still could not es- tablish them as final proof. We would still need official confirmation. The subject of secrecy, which Greenwell questions, is another issue, and there is much data available known to resear- chers alleging it does exist. To comment on Greenwell's post- ulate that the popular blockbuster movie, \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" may have triggered people, emotionally disturbed or as pranksters, to come forth with UFO retrieval and little green men stories, I wish to em- phasize that most of my firsthand sources just don't seem to fit the psy- chotic or weirdo types. Most, working initially through an intermediary,have shown a reluctance to talk too much until I assured them of anonymity and confidential treatment on other details relative to military or personal matters. Notably, almost all sources indi- cated no inclination to take an active part in UFO research for fame or for- tune, either because they were fearful of reprisals based on their secrecy oath, or the desire for privacy for business or family reasons. Interestingly, most were not sufficiently attuned to the subject of UFOs to even keep up with the current literature. Only one source admitted that he read my book,Situa- tion Red: The UFO Siege, before he called to relate his experience. My medical source referred to in my late paper, for instance, was known to me prior to the movie \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and all of its promotional gimmicks. The anatomical data he related desc- scribe the recovered humanoid both externally and internally. He had no guidelines to sway his disclosures. Yes, I realize that I could have been duped by clever people, working alone or in collusion for ulterior purposes. Then, one may ask, is there orchestra- tion? Perhaps, but no proof of it. However, orchestration could work at either end of the spectrum. Maybe, for the sake of argument, some of the in- formation coming from seemingly re- liable people is the truth, and there is a master plan with a tentative timetable to release information, spoon-fed slow- iy. Significantly, my ranks of infor- mants are growing. Besides the 19 in hand, there are prospective others. In fact, several; and, my intermediaries who may allow me to reach them are above the average cut. Are .they all nuts or are they paid deceptionists? And, will I be willing to buy their Brooklyn Bridges? I don't know, but I will report their testimonials for what- ever they are worth for all to judge. In this endeavor we need more professional people like Greenwell to come forward. I believe that my pub- lished material should be analyzed and be open for criticism. In the meantime I hope to continue my probes and to publish my new findings for critical review. Maybe somewhere out there is the one airtight case that will verify the potentially greatest story on Earth - or maybe, in time, we'll get enough negative evidence to.relegate the whole crash/retrieval story to the heaps of science fiction. Frankly, I'm seeing a lot of fire under the smoke. - September 24, 1980.

' A major wave of UFO sightings occurred in Italy during 1978, mostly concentrated in the period from Octo- ber through the first few days of Janu- ary 1979. More than 500 cases are on record. At least 130 of them were close encounters, 25 involving huma- noid entities, 20 physical trace cases, 30 cases with physiological or other temporary effects, and at least 50 pho- tographs. Although the sightings led to unprecedented public discussion and debate, even in the Italian Parliament, they were essentially ignored by con- ventional news media in the United States. As was true of the 1973 wave in the United States, a small percentage of.the sightings involved very bizarre, roughly humanoid entities and \"high strangeness\" activities. Coinciding with the peak of the Italian wave were the October 21 disappearance of Australian pilot Frederick Valentich, the Novem- ber oil field landings in Kuwait, and the December radar-visual and film cases in New Zealand. As reported in the Journal (No. 133), UFOs also were seen and photographed in several Arab nations during December that year. It now appears that a major UFO wave occurred under the noses of interna- tional news media in Fall and Winter 1978, and went largely unreported ex- cept locally. The reports from Italy are too numerous to cover completely; some representative close encounter cases, types I-III, are reported here. Addi- tional details are available from the Italian groups, whose addresses appear below. The reports still are being in- vestigated and evaluated by serious re- X UFO emitting light beams, Napoli, July 3,1978. (Source: Maurizio Verga) searchers in Italy (which also has its \"contactee\" cults and skeptical scien- tists). According to E. Russo, the earli- est sightings of interest took place in the far northern provinces. On March 11 three radio amateurs from Friuli, Udine province, were practicing their avocation on Mt. Bernardia when they saw an orange ball pass over their car and land in nearby woods. Curious, they approached to investigate but were frightened away by the brilliant glow from the .landed object. On March 20, one of the men was urged by a \"telepathic message\" to return to the scene; there he encountered a 2-meter-tall humanoid being wearing a one-piece suit and helmet. The being extended its hand, and when the man took it he felt pain and had to struggle free from the grasp. The being then re- turned to a craft and was transported inside it by a conical beam of light. The witness reported that his hand burned for several weeks. He received a message that the being would return. On March 29 in the same province, a lighted object was observed to land and the radio of an amateur operator went dead. About 10 witnesses ap- proached the landing site to investigate, but again the brilliant illumination frightened them away. Next day, an 8- meter circle of burned grass and soil was found at the site. Similar landing traces associated with unidentified lights were found elsewhere in the pro- vince. At one site in Mortigliano, plants in an area about 17 meters in diameter later showed unusual growth and green- ness. On July 3 at Napoli, a woman was awakened at 1:40 a.m. by an intense light and saw a hemispherical or dome- shaped disc (see sketch) hovering about 100 meters away, emitting orange- tinted light toward the ground and beams of light from its lower edge. After about 40 seconds, the UFO moved slowly away and disappeared in the distance. On July 4 military personnel from the Navy Air Base at Catania felt a complusion to ascend the slopes of Mt. Etna, and there saw three red, pulsat- ing UFOs, one of which landed. It was a domed disc about 12 meters in diame- ter with red and yellow body lights. The group then encountered two tall, golden-haired, white-robed beings ac- 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CE-III at Torrita di Siena, September 17,1978.

They had been exposed to the lec- tures of a notorious local contactee, casting doubt on the credibility of the story, but appeared to be responsible people. Also, independent witnesses in and around Catania had reported UFO sightings about the same time. At San Michele, Alessandria, Sep- tember 2, about 8:10 a.m., a man heard a hissing sound and saw a metal- lic-appearing, cigar-shaped UFO about 10 meters long rise from a field of maize. At the site, an area of crushed and dried plants measuring about 3 meters by 6.5 meters was found. Also in September (date not speci- fied), at Penna Sant'Andrea, four peo- ple in a car were driving toward Tera- mo when they saw a UFO descending into a ravine about 50 meters away. The object was egg-shaped, grayish, and had a central ring and three leg- like protuberances on the underside. (See sketch.) A flame or light was be- ing emitted from one side. No sound could be heard. The pace of sightings began to pick up in September. At Torrita di Siena, September 17, about 8:15 p.m., a woman and her son saw a descending red ball illuminating the area, and watched houselights in the area black out. Shortly afterwards, a barber got into his car and drove a few meters, and suddenly his engine and lights went out and a bright object descended over the road just ahead of his car. Hover- ing about a half-meter above the road was a 3-meter diameter orange-red ob- ject with a dome, appearing hat-like in shape. Three light beams were extend- ing from the object to the road. A panel opened and two huma- noids emerged and \"floated\" toward the car, their feet never touching the ground. They were about 1-2 meters tall, wearing green coveralls and hel- mets with two protrusions (\"aerials\"). UFO near Penna Sant'Andrea, Sept. 1978. (Source: Maurizio Verga) The beings circled the car, apparently more interested in it than in the pas- sengers, then re-entered the UFO which took off with a flash of light and explosive sound. Three scorched circles about 50 cm in diameter and about 4 meters apart were found on the road surface (apparently cor- responding to the three light beams from the UFO). Soil and trace analyses have so far shown nothing extraordina- ry- October - December Peak Coinciding with the peak of the wave was a series of anomalies along the Adriatic coastline from mid-Octo- ber into December: strange disturban- ces in the water, including tall columns of foaming water; light phenomena harrassing fishermen; objects seen en- tering and leaving the water; electro- magnetic effects on radar and radio in fishing boats; and severe television in- terference. Since the fishing trade is important in that area, the Navy sent two ships to patrol the coastline, amidst a public clamor for a govern- ment investigation of UFOs. \"Experts\" came forth with often self-contradic- tory shotgun explanations, and a rush of IFO reports came from an excited populace that suddenly focused on bright planets or stars that they had not noticed before. At a mountain site in San Donati di Tagliacozzo, October 25, about 5:00 a.m., a farmer was searching for a cow missing since the night before, when he came across a strange object on the ground. It was a brownish lenti- cular disc about 3 meters in diameter and 1.5 meters tall with round win- dows around the circumference. Inside he could see 4-5 green-dressed beings wearing conical caps and two smiling, pink-skinned women. Frightened and confused, he hid behind bushes, but when he looked again the apparition (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Italy, continued) was still there. He closed his eyes for several minutes, and when he looked again the object was gone. Some rocks had been removed from the site and the grass had turned yellow. Amidst the numerous reports from average citizens were some by well-qualified observers, such as Air Force personnel and control tower op- erators at Rome-Fiumicino Airport. On November 12 at 7:30 p.m., they saw three unidentified orange spheres approach from the sea, one descending and slowly crossing the landing ap- proach path of airliners and threaten- ing a collision. Before they could react, the objects disappeared to the East. About half of the more than 500 cases occurred in December, including one of the few abduction cases known in Italy. Night watchman Fortunato Zanfretta, 26, was patrolling an area of Torriglia in the late evening of Decem- ber 6, when, at 11:45 p.m., he saw lights in a courtyard and approached to investigate. As he did so, his car en- gine and all lights failed; when he tried to report to his base station, his radio would not work. Undaunted, he ap- proached on foot and tried to surprise the supposed burglars. Zanfretta suddenly clashed with a 3-meter-tall being or creature whose physical appearance shocked him (see sketch) and may have caused a memory blackout. The being seemed to disap- pear in thin air, and Zanfretta fled to- ward his car. He heard a loud hiss and felt a wave of heat, and saw a huge tri- angular object rise from behind the house and disappear toward the sea. The electrical system of the car was now functioning normally, and at 12:16 a.m. the base station heard him exclaiming over the radio, \"They're not men!\" Zanfretta could not account for the time lapse, and suggested that he may have fainted. He was found by his colleagues at 1:06 a.m. lying in a meadow 80 meters from the house — a second time lapse, since he had another memory gap after reporting in on the radio. Nearby in the field was a horse- shoe-shaped darkened area measuring 25 by 8 meters, and about 3 cm deep, with flattened grass.' Next morning Creature reported in abduction case December 6, 1978. (Source: Massimo Greco) similar traces were found behind the house where the UFO had been seen taking off. Independent witnesses were found who had seen a yellow, triangle- shaped object approaching Torriglia at 9:00 p.m. Zanfretta had a bad headache which persisted for days. Under regres- sive hypnosis on December 23, he de- scribed not one, but several, \"mon- strous beings\" who indicated that they wanted him to go with them. Unable to resist, he was taken to a hot, round room where something was placed on his forehead that caused pain. Left alone, he fled yelling for help. Due to the anxiety he exhibited at this point of the hypnosis, the session was ended and another one was scheduled for December 30. Back on his job on December 27, at 11:46 p.m. his base station heard him on the radio complaining about a headache and a blinding mist; he de- scribed losing control of the car, which moved at a high speed and then stopped abruptly. At that point he saw a bright oval object. At 11-50 p.m. he was heard to say, \"I've arrived; there's a bright light out here; I have to go.\" His colleagues began an immediate search, but did not find him until 1:09 a.m. When found, he was hot and confused, and his face appeared sunburned. A fpllow-up hypnosis session was held on January 7, 1979, at which time he .recalled being taken on board, a yellow triangular craft by a green light. beam and. encountering 10 or more beings who. were tall, greenish, with yellow triangular eyes and human- like hands and legs. Instead of mouths, they had \"nets\" that emitted light. On February 6, Zanfretta underwent sodi- um pentothal examination at a major medical center in Milan, under the per- sonal supervision of the Director. His story was exactly the same as previous- ly told consciously and under hypnosis. Most of the December cases came from southern Italy, with scores of re- ports by police and military witnesses. Photographs were taken (and published in newpapers) by Gendarmerie patrols in Palermo on the nights of December 11, 12, and 13. Electromagnetic ef- fects were associated with several of the sightings, typically disturbances on police radio while the UFOs were present. At the same time, a public \"UFO psychosis\" was evident, with numerous reports clearly attributable to Venus, Jupiter, meteors, and other conventional objects. A sort of climax was reached on December 15 when there were three CE-III reports from three separate pro- vinces. In Ragusa province at 11:50 p.m., a truck driver experienced radio failure and stopped to repair it, when he encountered two humanoid beings about 2 meters tall dressed in tight-fit- ting coveralls and helmets. From a dis- tance of about 5 meters, two bright beams of light were emitted from their helmets and illuminated the truck cabin. The beings then came closer, uttered unintelligible sounds, then turned and left. A few seconds later the truck driver saw a dome-shaped object take off with a bright flash, after which his radio worked normally. A strong smell of sulfur permeated the air. Commentary This sighting wave illustrates an important'point applicable in all coun- tries. Given the bizarre story content - the \"high strangeness\"-of many of the reports, it should not be surprising that scientists and officials express skepticism about UFO reports. Espe- cially those who have little background knowledge about the UFO subject. When - on top of \"tall stories\" - the same people find evidence of careless or incomplete investigations, reasons to believe that large numbers of sight- ings have conventional explanations, and premature theorizing about poorly 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"UFO SECRECY UPDATE UFO Secrecy in the Courts By Larry W.

For in retrospection by any seasoned observer of the UFO scene, there's no doubt that the public- relations exercise of Blue Book (and its predecessors) was just that — a pro- paganda campaign to divert the public from critical appraisal of the true na- ture of the UFO enigma, whatever that nature be. According to some critics, Blue Book was a carefully orchestrated conspiracy of silence/misrepresenta- tion/news management.

If self-proclaimed \"UFOlogists\" wish to live up to their claims, they must make a strong effort to weed out explainable or trivial cases and to thoroughly in- vestigate and document the potentially significant cases.

Maurizio Verga, via Matteotti 69, 22072, Cermenate, Italy. One such seeker is New York City lawyer Peter A Gersten. It is to his credit that the public has gained access to several thousand pages of intelligence documents relating to the ubiquitous UFOs. He began his quest for the long- supressed UFO documentation over 2 years ago, culminating in the Freedom of Information lawsuit of Ground Sau- cer Watch, Inc. [GSW-Phoenix, Ariz.], Versus U.S. Central Intelligence Agen- cy. The partial success of that suit — re- sulting in the Agency's release of al- most 1,000 pages of documents late in 1978 — is a matter of record in the an- nals of privately funded UFO reasearch. The considerable expenditure of time and funds on Gersten's part is not over, however. For on May 30, 1980, in a memorandum of opinion issued by Federal Judge John H. Pratt, the CIA, through a \"motion for summary judgment,\" succeeded in having the case decided in the Agency's favor — an event not unexpected by the more cynical among UFO-oriented citizens. Even so, Gersten is not one to be dis- missed so lightly, especially if there be the slightest chance that the appeals court would send the case back to the lower court for a redetermination as to the reality of the Agency's de novo re- cords-search mandated by stipulation. At issue, of course, is the veracity of the Agency affidavits that the search was indeed real and adequate. So on June 24th Gersten filed a notice of ap- peal with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, thus ringing in round No. 3 of Civil Action No. 78-859. But that's not the only action Gersten had a hand in filing on that busy court day of June 24th. The bat- tle for free access to the supposedly vast reservoir of Federal UFO docu- mentation was escalated by the filing of three additional suits — one each against the supersecret (and almost sacrosanct) National Security Agency (NSA), the equally taciturn Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and the even more bureaucratically burdened Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Gersten's client this time is the Washington, D.C.-based public-interest group Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS). Let's look at each of these cases in relation to one another and in the re- spective of their overall impact on the future of FOIA-assisted UFOlogy. NSA (Civil Action No. 80-1562). The history of FOIA action against this Fort George G. Meade (Md.)-based enterprise of communications surveil- lance and intelligence collection offers little encouragement to advocates of the public's right to know. Indeed, were the Agency's self-serving efforts to prevail in legislative and judicial cir- cles, it wouldn't be long before it would have total exemption from the provisions of the Act — a development that could close the door of public access to all past, present, and future UFO data in the Agency's possession. Thanks to the foot-in-the-door provided by Gersten's action against the CIA, the \"burden of proof of nonreleasability of existing NSA-held UFO documentation still rests with the Freedom of Information Coordi- nator at NSA headquarters. It was to that official that the CIA, based on some prestipulation records-searching, referred 18 classified documents for a releasability determination. NSA's top management not only has refused to clear those documents for release, but also has reiterated its position that, in (Continued on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"(Secrecy, continued) the words of a March 12, 1980, letter to me: . .. . there are no NSA/CSS [Central Security Service] directives that ad- dress authorities and procedures for processing UFO-encounter reports. The production of any such report would be only incidental to an assigned task and would be done in accordance with procedures for miscellaneous reporting. Could such an \"assigned task\" be the analysis of, say, the human survival implications inherent in the UFO phe- nomenon? That question will be at the forefront of the interrogatories expect- ed to be submitted by Gersten. For it's prompted by the curious, highly cen- sored, 6-page, \"unofficial\" (though of- ficially released) NSA document titled \"UFO Hypothesis and Survival Ques- tions,\" which apparently was drafted in 1968 by an unnamed NSA analyst. Gersten's complaint cites this contro- versial \"nondocument\" as Exhibit H, along with another classified, 7-page paper headed \"SUBJECT: UFO's\" (Exhibit I), which discusses the psy- chological reactions to the \"degree of strangeness\" in UFO encounters. As the tip of the UFO iceberg at NSA headquarters, these two docu- ments have not just historical value as a portion of documentation apart from the Project Blue Book files; they also serve to show that our govern- ment is ever ready, behind the scenes, to wade into that tricky sea of investi- gation known as UFOlogy. But in case it wades too deep, it wants an escape route. That route - that life preserver, lifeguard, or scuba gear — is embodied in the ability of government officials to classify, and keep classified, the product of their investigations. Not only may Gersten's efforts to remedy that practice make judicial history, but they also might reveal that UFOs con- stitute not so much'a matter of \"na- - tional security\" as a matter of national in security. The latest development in the NSA suit occurred on September 3, 1980. On that morning, in the cham- bers of Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, coun- sel for each side met for about 10 min- utes in a \"status hearing.\" After listen- ing to, and apparently concurring in, the CAUS position that any official in- telligence document on UFOs readily can be sanitized to protect sources and intelligence-gathering methods, the Judge ordered the U.S. attorney's of- fice to identify the documents in ques- tion and to tailor its nonreleasability affidavits to the content of each docu- ment. \"How many documents are we talking about here?\" asked the Judge. The answer itself certainly makes UFOlogical news, for the U.S. counsel replied, \"135 documents\" — a fact which heretofore the Agency had re- fused to divulge. This documentation probably in- cludes the highly censored teletype message dispatched by the U.S. De- fense Attache's Office in Lima, Peru, on June 2, 1980, to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff (with \"information copies\" re- layed through the Defense Intelligence Agency to the National Security Agen- cy and the Central Intelligence Agency, among others). Existence of the mes- sage had been confirmed in an alleged double-check records review conducted by the Defense Intelligence Agency in response to the CAUS complaint. \"This is exactly the kind of material we're seeking,\" explained Peter Ger- sten to the Judge. \"We don't care about the who-and-how of the acquisi- tion of the information - what we care about, for the sake of making data available for appropriate study, is that on such-and-such a date Peruvian air force jets tried to intercept and de- stroy one or more UFOs in southern Peru.\" DIA (Civil Action No. 80-1563). Like the NSA suit, this action seeks to enjoin the Agency from preventing ac- cess to its supposedly nonexistent UFO records. Back on March 6,1977, when I submitted an FOIA request for all documents pertaining to the now- famous Iranian UFO encounter of Sep- tember 19, 1976, I was told by the FOIA officer that \"The organizational structure of DIA does not encompass a UFO Directorate [the hypothetical of- fice to which I addressed my request], nor do we have the authority to col- lect data on this'subject since it is not an element of our mission. For UFO information it is suggested you write to [the University of Colorado's Joint Institute for Astrophysics].\" With that glib kiss-off, the officer .disposed of yet another nuisance exercise of the citizens' right to know. Little did he realize, then, how that leaked UFO- sighting report would return again and again to haunt him and his agency. The hollow ring of his protestation about DIA involvement in official UFO research is matched in phoniness by his reference to the University of Colorado - which is a throwback to the mercy killing and burial of Project Blue Book by the University's Condon Committee in 1968. If agencies like the CIA, NSA, and DIA really have no formal charter to collect, analyze, and disseminate UFO information, then why do they con- tinue to crop up on various distribu- tion lists as addressees for UFO-sight- ing reports and UFO policy documents? This question is central to the suit, and in any pretrial negotiations there's no escaping-it. If the continuing UFO paper chase is to mean anything, it must mean that government officials are to be held accountable for conspir- ing to suppress vital UFO data in their possession. Ultimately, the success of this suit and the related ones could foster reform in the negative attitude and malfeasance of the UFO policy- makers throughout the Executive Branch. FAA (Civil Action No. 80-1564). The \"politics of UFOlogy\" is rife with governmental indecision, bureaucratic bungling, coverup/foulup, and the vested interests (too often competing) of individuals and organizations both public and private. There's no more fertile ground than this for mass con- fusion and misinformation to flourish - at the expense of the taxpayer and maybe to the detriment of our na- tional security. So when a Federal Agency is observed sitting on its hands or, worse, deliberately contravening the letter or spirit of the Freedom of Information Act, you can expect some outcry from concerned citizens. In this case, the agency is the one charged with monitoring the safe, efficient operation of our airways — the Federal Aviation Administration. And the ac- cuser is CAUS counsel Peter A. Ger- sten. It's his contention that the Ad- ministration, in responding to a CAUS FOIA request for access to all FAA- possessed UFO documentation, failed. 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"UFO DATA MART Note: This service is available free to individual MUFON subscribers, but not to commercial dealers.

Letters Symposium Correction Editor, It has been brought to my atten- tion by MUFON-CES (Europe) that I did not give proper credit to my sour- ces of information in my paper on the Unified Field Theory of Burkhard Heim which appeared in the 1980 MUFON Proceedings (U.S.A.). For this oversight I must take full responsi- bility and offer my most humble apol- ogies to MUFON-CES and especially to their editor Diplomate Physicist Illo Brand von Ludwiger. I wish to assure all the parties involved that this unfor- tunate oversight was not in any way intentional. If I recall correctly, as I was writ- ing the paper my mind was concentrat- ing fully upon the magnificent contri- butions of Mr. Heim and how I was going to make his work better known to the American people.

Fi- nally, this is the first time that I have contributed a paper to a journal; thus, I was not fully aware of how important it is to make certain that proper credit is given for all ideas which are not orig- inal. The shock of this experience makes it a certainty that such a mis- take will not be repeated by this author in the future. I still have a great deal of work to do before I understand Helm's theory and Mr. I. Brand's contributions to the extent that I desire. Only after I have achieved such understanding will I be able to make contributions to this theory in an original manner. However, while obtaining this understanding, it is necessary to translate from German the work which has been done by these two fine theoretical thinkers. Mr. I. Brand has been kind enough to send me Heim's book: \"Elementary Structures of Matter\" which 1 am now in the pro- cess of translating. It is my hope that I will have this translation ready by the time of the next American MUFON conference.

The speakers and their subjects were: J. Al- len Hynek, Ph.D., \"The Coming Age In UFOlogy\"; Paul Cerny, \"California Report and Ancient Sightings\"; Tom Gates, \"The Effect of UFOs on Socie- ty\"; Marvin Taylor, \"Society's Reluc- tance in Accepting UFOs\"; Richard Boylan, \"The Use and Abuse of Psy- chology and Hypnosis in UFOlogy\"; John Dunlap, \"UFO Propulsion Theo- ries\"; Phil Haydn-Myer, \"International Sightings Since 1947\"; Bill Lundgren, \"Government Intervention and Re- sponse to UFO Phenomena\"; Dick Morris, \"UFO Movie and Slide Presen- tation\"; and Larry Stanley, \"Field In- vestigator's Practices\". On October 16th, MUFON under the direction of Paul Cerny, Western Regional Director, sponsored a UFO lecture at the Civic Auditorium in Redding, California featuring Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Tom Gates. Between speaking engagements, Dr. Hynek was introduced to steelhead fishing by Mr. Cerny in northern California. Dr. Hynek's public appearances in the \"Golden Bear State\" under the auspices of MUFON is indicative of the fine cooperation that exists between CUFOS and MUFON. George D. Fawcett, MUFON State Director for North Carolina since 1974, was honored for his services by the Tar Heel UFO Study Group at the MUFON-NC Fourth Annual Training Conference in Winston-Salem on June 21 and 22, 1980. A tape recorded message, congratulating Mr. Fawcett for his dedicated service from Walt An-> drus, was broadcast to the assemblage. Stanley C. Ferguson, State Sec- tion Director for the Dallas, TX metro- plex area, was instrumental in organiz- ing a meeting for all MUFON members and interested people on October 15, 1980 at the home of the Reverend G. Neal Hern in Dallas. Its purpose was to organize the field investigators into a cohesive and trained team so as to re- spond to UFO sighting reports. The formal program consisted of two video taped films, \"UFOs Are Real\", a docu- mentary co-written by a scientific con- sultant, Stanton T. Friedman; and Linda Howe's documentary on cattle mutilations, titled \"A Strange Harvest\". Stan and Neal are to be commended for initiating this activity in order to revitalize this part of the Lone Star State. This also became the occasion to introduce and announce the ap- pointment of G. Neal Hern, an Episco- pal Priest, as the new State Director for Texas, replacing William A. Dexter. Neal and his family reside at 4329 Irvin Simmons Drive, Dallas,TX75229; tele- phone: (214) 358-4863. This is a cul- mination of several personal meetings between Rev. Hern and your director over the past year. The continuity of MUFON's state organizations is maintained through planned transitions by retiring state directors, recommending and coopera- ting with their successors. Dan R. Wright, a former State Section Direc- tor, is succeeding Ron Westrum as State Director for Michigan. Ron will continue his relationship as a Consul- tant in Sociology and Field Investiga- tor. Dan has his Masters Degree and is professionally a social research ana- lyst. He may be contacted at 113 Sandstone Creek, #17, Grand Ledge, MI 48837; telephone: (517) 627-9497. David Fideler, P. 0.
