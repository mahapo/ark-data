Volunteering starts at the top with the MUFON Board of Directors who govern the organization to not only ensure its viability but also that MUFON remains true to its duty to the public as a nonprofit organization. To ensure that MUFON’s three primary goals are met, our functional directors – Director of Investigations, Director of Research, and Director of Public Education work tirelessly towards those goals. Complementing the functional directors are a number of special positions such as Director of Special Projects, Staff Photographer, etc. MUFON Consultants and Research Specialists volunteer their time and special expertise to ensure that MUFON’s approach to the UFO phenomenon is based in science. At the local chapter level, MUFON State Directors and Assistant State Directors work hard to ensure that MUFON’s membership goals are met, that the public is informed of MUFON’s work and goals, and to manage the extensive investigator network. MUFON State Section Directors complement the work of the State/ Assistant State Directors in managing their geographical areas of responsibility and are the boots on the ground when a UFO event occurs.

Oftentimes MUFON receives unsolicited photo or video evidence of alleged UFOs for analysis. MUFON passes the evidence on to our two primary analysts, Jeff Sainio and Bruce Maccabee, both of who graciously volunteer their time and expertise at no cost to MUFON. The photo and video evidence submitted to MUFON can be placed in one of two categories, “eyewit- nessed” and “later observation.” Eye- witnessed photos/videos are pur- posely taken to capture the image of an object(s) that was consciously observed by the witness. Later observation photos/videos depict an object(s) that was not noticed at the time the photo/video was taken and was only later seen on the print/ video. The eye-witnessed photos/videos are of greater interest because the witness can not only describe what they were seeing with the naked eye but can also typically provide more corroborative data such as wind direction, position of the sun, object maneuvers, etc. The later observa- tion photos/videos can oftentimes be ruled out as bugs, lens flares, film defects, etc. It is a sad fact that some photos and videos are hoaxed. In 2006, a whole series of videos were hoaxed by one man alone, Chris Kentworthy, a filmmaker/writer. In an interview conducted by ufowatchdog.com, Mr. Kentworthy describes how he created thirty hoaxed videos over a two to three month period and claims that his intent was to show how both the UFO as well as the skeptical community were equally gullible—that is, the UFO proponents were too quick to accept the evidence as real and the skeptics too quick to denounce it as something else. Mr. Kenthworthy went on to elaborate that many were erroneously convinced that some of his hoaxed videos were impossible to fake and that Hollywood special effects would be required to do so, and even went so far as to offer advice to UFO researchers to “send every clip they receive to FX (special effects) artists, straight away.” Jeff Sainio and Bruce Maccabee have presented a number of papers at MUFON’s annual symposiums on photo and video analysis. Although somewhat outdated in terms of both the technology used by the photo/ video witness as well as the photo/ video analyst, the papers represent a wealth of still relevant information that should be taught to MUFON Field Investigators and passed on to UFO witnesses. Photo Analysis Photo Analysis Photo Analysis Photo Analysis Photo Analysis In 1992, Jeff Sainio presented a paper at the MUFON Symposium titled: “Photo Analysis, A Pictorial Primer.” Here is an excerpt of that paper: The unknown nature of UFOs means that a photo can’t be catego- rized as faked merely on its face. As an example, perhaps a witness states that a UFO had an antenna protruding from the top, although this is not obvious on the film. However, the photo analyst succeeds in enhancing the image to reveal it. As the photo- grapher was able to predict what would be found, this should enhance the witness’ stature. (Either as truthful, or talented in predicting the discovery of a supporting string. . .) The results of a photo analysis are only one of many tools the field investigator must use to evaluate a case. Actually, a photograph of practi- cally any quality can be faked with enough time, money and expertise. Any “Star Wars” movie is an example; hours of very convincing video are totally faked. It merely requires a few million dollars and several years. The field investigator must determine whether the witness (or his friend, or her Hollywood producer brother-in- law) had the resources to produce the photo(s) in question. Most UFO photographs are quite bad, since UFOs are usually nocturnal, and nighttime photography is difficult even with the right equipment, film, and training. When an excited novice with an ordinary camera, ASA 100 film, and no tripod, takes a UFO photograph, the result is usually a black image with an overexposed, smeared blob. The photo analyst may extract the UFO color from a lens flare or glare, or find some- thing interesting in a motion streak, but How MUFON handles Photo and Video Analysis MUFON hosts an online mes- sage board where photo and video evidence sent to MUFON for analysis can be discussed and debated by photo and video experts. If you consider yourself to be such an expert, and would like to participate in this forum, please email your qualifications to jcarrion@mufon.com . Select qualified analysts will be invited to participate in the forum. James Carrion MUFON International Director Discuss photo and video evidence at Online Forum"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"June 2007 4 MUFON UFO Journal Continued on page 5 Continued from page 3 this is usually of limited use in identi- fication.” A poor or possibly faked photo from a single, unreliable witness may not merit much study, but multiple corresponding testimonies from num- erous people are difficult to dismiss. Photo analysis uses techniques worth listing 1. Looking closely at the photo(s). This seems obvious, but experts have stumbled by failing to take this simple step. Only good eyes, a good copy of the photo(s), and common sense, are needed to do fairly well at this. If there was a sequence of photos, with some method of verifying the order in which they were taken, even more can be learned. Little or no equipment is needed. In the case of color photos, some red, green, and blue filters can be placed over the eye to examine the individual colors. 2. Attempting to replicate the photo(s) using hypothesized methods in a fact, faked or fooled sense. A camera, preferably similar to the one used, and various props are required. As will be shown, many “Monday morning quarterbacks” hypothesize methods of replication, but fail to test their ideas using this simple but often time-consuming method. For instance, the government investi- gation of the Heflin photos dupli- cated several of the shots with a 35mm camera. If they had dupli- cated all the shots with a 108 camera, they would have found a critical difference between the first three photos, of the UFO, and the last, of a smoke ring. The UFO photographs were taken from inside a pickup, and the top third of the photos are simply the dark ceiling of the cab. The lower parts of the photographs show relatively dark ground or brush. Only the middle third shows sky. In contrast, the smoke ring photo shows no darkness at all, only bright sky and the still bright ring. The camera’s automatic exposure-control would be expected to use a longer exposure inside the cab, and a shorter exposure of the bright sky. Thus the sky would photograph brighter from the cab. The photos were rejected partially on this basis of the cloud brightness being darker in the ring photograph, but this was merely normal automatic exposure-control for that camera. 3.Extensive computerized analysis. The price of this method is tumbling due to the explosion of the desktop publishing market, which uses many hardware and software tools similar to those needed in photo analysis. Visual Analysis Techniques Some structure is usually required in a photo to be of much use. This structure does not need to be in the usual two dimensions. Every photo- graph is a time exposure of some duration. In total, five dimensions are recorded on film, compressed to three. They are the expected height and width, and also distance, time, and color. These can be converted from one to another. For instance, a spectro- graph of a UFO converts the color spectrum into a horizontal line. Or, if a night photograph is carefully taken, a long exposure of a distant moving UFO can yield path or speed information rather than shape information. Do not “help” the photo analyst by cropping or magnifying a UFO image prior to submitting it. Apparently uninteresting information off in some corner of a photo can be invaluable in analysis. (Filling out the relevant forms from the Field Investigator’s Manual should be remembered as well.) Timing information can often be extracted from a photo or series of photos. In general, video analysis is a highly valuable tool. A practically indigestible amount of information is generated at 30 frames per second. Camcorders are more sensitive at nighttime lighting than cameras are, and they never give a several second smeared image due to insufficient light. They are weak in color and resolution, although frame averaging can improve these problems. Video is harder to fake, as it adds another dimension, time, to the record of events. Often the added time dimension can be used to determine the fourth dimension, distance. Sound, or often the lack of it, is another verification that videotape includes. Video Analysis Video Analysis Video Analysis Video Analysis Video Analysis Jeff Sainio made a related presentation at the 1993 MUFON Symposium on video analysis. Excerpt follows: The dropping cost, increasing quality and zoom lenses of camcorders make them valuable tools in Ufology. Since no processing of the result is needed, recording is essentially free. The built-in viewfinder instantly verifies that a strange scene is indeed being recorded. No film processing clerk can ask embarrassing questions of the witness. So an army of videophiles is willing to film almost anything without inhibition. With prudence, UFO videotapes can provide invaluable evidence. The volume of UFO evidence on television makes elementary video analysis a necessity for every “trench Ufologist.” In this paper, I hope to show the reader the advantage and pitfalls of video evidence, and demonstrate how a viewer can critically evaluate a video. Video adds the element of time to a photo. Movement, acceleration, and sound are now available. The common Video and Photo Analysis"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"      5 MUFON UFO Journal June 2007 problem of a dark nighttime photo, a long automatic exposure resulting in an overexposed blob of a UFO, is impossible because video takes a fixed 30 frames per second. (Overexposure is still quite possible.) With any variety in the zoom, focus, background and distance in the UFO video, an astounding amount of data is available in even a minute of tape. Compare this to a UFO sighting involving a still camera, where a half dozen photos would be considered a windfall. Most of the techniques of photo analysis can be used in video analysis. The substrate of silicon rather than film requires a knowledge of electronics rather than chemistry. Focus deter- minations, lens flares and known reference objects are treated as in film. Be warned, film lens flares are always brighter than the background; this is not necessarily true on video-tape due to signal “bounce” as described below. Film defects have their analogs in tape defects, but their nonrepetition in successive frames usually reveals their true nature. The low resolution, high noise levels, and poor color of video mean that many of the subtle techniques of photo analysis are of little worth. This leaves several techniques that can be done with patience and a VCR capable of decent stop-action. Video-capture equipment and image processing software certainly make it easier, but useful results can be had with frame- by-frame inspection and measurements using a ruler on a TV screen. Video Advantages A photo or video is a two- dimensional representation of three- dimensional space. (The “dimensions” of brightness and time could also be counted.) Much of video analysis involves utilizing or cross converting these dimensions to determine, say, size or speed. In photo analysis, a lucky shot will show some known object in front or behind the UFO, placing constraints on the UFO distance. Most amateurs would consider an obscured UFO shot to be a poor photo and avoid doing this. So distance determination is difficult. In contrast, the astounding amount of information in a video often contains a segment showing the UFO behind a branch or before a cloud, thus yielding some distance information. Difficulty in Fakery While simple cheap techniques can be used to take photographs, faking a video is a much more difficult task. Double-exposures and negative sandwiches simply can’t be done. Anything can be faked with enough of Paul Ehrlich’s four Gs: Geduld, Geschick, Geld, and Gluck (German for patience, skill, money and luck). Generally the complexity of an electronic, moving picture puts idle tomfoolery out of the question. Optical tricks used in photography are still possible, but the requirement of motion complicates the matter. Reading the Videographer The camera aim also indicates the intent of the videographer. Remember that the videographer has the “best seat in the house.” If the camera aim ignores some object, it is probably not important. Many UFO analyses center on images which are not followed by the camera. A plainly obvious disregarded UFO should be viewed with suspicion, since the primary witness did not consider the image interesting. Of course, the audio track is also useful in hearing what is holding the videographer’s interest. Audio can be used to synchronize different cam- corders through sounds simultaneously recorded, or determine the timing of a photograph by recording the shutter click. Focus or zoom-motor noises might be heard, indicating when they were used. Recorded engine noise can identify an airplane. Although this is more in the field of psychology, the witness’ voices can show excitement that corroborates their truthfulness, or giggling that reveals a fraud. Tips for Videotaping a UFO As with film, use references to compare a UFO image with a known object. You need not be an expert in videography or electronics. It’s usually the first thing an expert will do. Simply film an object similar to the UFO with a similar background, using the same camcorder if possible. Fiddle with the camcorder controls to see if the UFO image can be duplicated. Hit buttons accidentally. Put a finger partially over the lens. Do anything else an excited witness might do. Use the zoom, focus, and electronic shutter controls. Don’t worry about damage as most camcorders can only be damaged by aiming them at the sun. You may not know just what you are doing, but the videographer probably didn’t either. Most videographers are surprisingly ignorant of their camcorder operation. A weird video might be the result of a weird setup. Remember that “luck” is one of the four Gs mentioned previously. Luck is the basis of much scientific progress, and you may hit on some combination that a professional would never dream of using. If you only have the submitted video, look on the UFO video for a known object similar to the UFO. If the known object has the same strange, unexplainable characteristics as the UFO, it’s the camcorder doing the trickery. Dedicated Ufologists will hopefully study and practice their camera work before “UFO hunting expeditions.” Updates in the MUFON Field Investigator’s Manual and this paper Video and Photo Analysis Continued from page 4 Continued on page 18"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"June 2007 6 MUFON UFO Journal Continued on page 7 The Hawaii House of Representa- tives recently drafted a resolution to the United Nations, to promote a “search for intelligent life and a definitive answer to whether or not it has come to Earth or is in our reach.” This resolution was published in the May issue of the MUFON UFO Journal , along with the MUFON testimony requested by the office of Rep. Rida T.R. Cabanilla, Chair for the Hawaii House of Representative Committee on International Affairs. Her office also requested testimony from the SETI Institute, which follows below. March 21, 2007 To: House Committee on International Affairs in consideration of House Resolution 65 Dear Members of the Committee: This is in support of House Resolution No. 65 calling on the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to proactively advance the cause of the peaceful uses of space, as well as the search for extraterrestrial life. The start of the 21 st century is a particularly auspicious time to consider the question of whether other sentient beings populate the vast star fields of our galaxy, or of other galaxies. This is because both our knowledge of astronomy, as well as our ever- increasing technical capabilities, have greatly encouraged a search for extra- terrestrial intelligence (SETI) by giving us reason to be sanguine about the outcome while simultaneously pro- viding us with efficient tools to make the search. While scientists still have no conclusive evidence of any life beyond Earth, several discoveries made by astronomers in the last decade have encouraged many in academia to think that such life might be commonplace. Some of these dis- coveries, as well as technical develop- ments that would aid a search for cosmic intelligence, are as follows: 1. We now have firm, observational evidence of planets circling stars other than the Sun. To date, more than 200 such planets have been found in a world-wide research effort. But as impressive as this number is, it is less significant than the fact that, typically, 5 to 10 percent of all stars observed show evidence of orbiting worlds. The actual percentage will be higher. In other words, there could easily be more planets in the universe than stars, which means that our Galaxy could be host to hundreds of billions of planets. 2. Examination of the nearby bodies of our own solar system has revealed that several show clear signs of possessing liquid water, the single most important ingredient in the sustenance of life. Not only subterranean Mars, but also five of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn might harbor water in a liquid state. By extrapolation, it seems overwhelmingly likely that many cosmic worlds could have the conditions necessary to host life. 3. Recent research has shown that life was flourishing on Earth more than 3.5 billion years ago, or shortly after the rain of rocks from space that characterized the environment of this planet in its youth had ended. That is to say, life appeared on Earth about as quickly as it could, sugges- ting that biology is not an improbable phenomenon. 4. Research to elucidate the develop- ment of intelligent life on this planet has shown that there were several, largely unrelated species that, over the course of the last 50 million years, have developed a high degree of intelligence. In addition to other primates, these species include dolphins and toothed whales, birds, and octopuses. The significance of this work is that it suggests that, once life has reached a certain minimum level of complexity, the evolution of intelligence might be reasonably common. 5. There have been great strides made in developing the instruments for finding intelligent life—the tele- scopes necessary to espy signals that are either deliberately or acci- dentally leaked from technological societies on other worlds. Indeed, the speed of SETI efforts to eaves- drop on extraterrestrial transmis- sions has increased at an exponen- tial rate, mirroring the exponential increase in capability of digital electronics. This is hardly coinci- dence, as SETI searches are intimately tied to the capability of computers and other digital hard- ware. This means that a project to scan the skies now would be hundreds, and eventually thousands of times faster than earlier efforts. 6. A premier representative of this improved search capability is the Allen Telescope Array, a joint project of the SETI Institute and the University of California at Berkeley. This instrument, now under con- struction in northern California, will eventually consist of 350 antennas, spread over approximately one kilometer of land, and will be—as noted—several hundreds of times faster at searching for signals as any predecessor experiment. This increased—and continually increasing—speed could lead to the discovery of a signal within a generation.

It has a distinguished cadre of research scientists, and a Board of Trustees that has both eminent members of academia (several have won Nobel prizes in science) and hi-tech industry. The Institute believes that, in the long history of humankind on this planet, there has never been a more auspicious time to extend our reach to the stars, and to energetically search for other intelligences in the vast spaces of the Galaxy. To find other societies would not only be a remarkable discovery, but would also give us a refined sense of our place in the universe. Respectfully submitted, Dr. Seth Shostak Senior Astronomer, SETI Institute SETI Institute 515 N. Whisman Road Mountain View, CA 94043 SETI Response Continued from page 6 By David Clarke I’m pleased to announce that the British MoD (Ministry of Defence) have decided to release their archive of 7,000 UFO reports made to the Defence Intelligence Staff covering a period of 30 years. The decision, announced in a letter I received last month, is a direct result of my attempts, working with col- leagues, to persuade the MoD to follow the recent French example and open their entire historical and recent archive to public scrutiny. An additional problem in the British case was that 24 files contain- ing UFO reports examined by the DIS branch DI55 from the mid-1970s until 2002, had been permanently closed along with 63,000 other records due to exposure to asbestos during storage in the basement of the Old War Office building in central London. Initially it was feared these files may have to be destroyed, but after an 18-month project (at a £3 million cost to the taxpayer) the entire archive has been saved. Work is now ongoing to scan and review selected files for release a) to the National Archives and b) onto the MoD’s Freedom of Information Act website. The DI55 UFO archive has been selected as an immediate priority for release due to its public interest value. In their letter to me dated 26 March the MoD say: “it has recently been decided that 24 files from the DI55 UFO archive are to be retrieved from the contaminated archives and scanned onto disk. At this point, each of the files [redacted if necessary] will be placed on the MoD Publication Scheme. Following this work, the files will then be accessible by the general public via the MOD FOI website. It will be a few weeks before we will be in a position to give an estimate as to when the files will be posted on the Publication Scheme.” Further details of the announce- ment can be found on my website’s news page here: http://www . drdavidclarke.co.uk/news1.htm and on page 4 of the current issue of Fortean Times (no. 223, June 2007). As the 24 files earmarked for release contain some 7,000 reports plus analysis and correspondence I suspect it will take some time for the entire archive to appear online, but having had a sneak preview of one year’s contents (1979) I can assure you the wait will be worthwhile. It should be noted that the material due for release contains a number of reports from service sources— including pilots and aircrew—that were never seen by the public “UFO desk” or Sec(AS). The archive also contains all 3,000 UFO reports re- ceived by MoD between 1987 and 1997 that were used to draw up the database used by the author of the Condign report that was commissioned by DI55 in 1997. The database itself was destroyed shortly after the report was circulated in 2000, see: http://www .uk-ufo.or g/ condign/ . The decision to release these files to the public is a major breakthrough and a landmark both for British Ufology and in the wider campaign for Freedom of Information in the UK. It also marks the end of my personal campaign, which began almost a decade ago before FOI arrived in 2005, to persuade the MoD to release all their UFO records. My first success was in 2001 firstly with the Rendlesham file and the report by the Flying Saucer Working Party. Success after success has followed, partly through persistence and partly through the support and assistance of fellow researchers, in particular Gary Anthony, Joe McGonagle, Chris Fowler, Andy Roberts and friends in the media, particularly James Randerson, science correspondent of The Guardian. Thanks to everyone who has supported us.

A Review of Historical Accounts By Warren P. Aston Continued on page 9 Warren Aston This is the second of three parts that explores the idea of extraterres- trials on earth. Aston deals not with “contactee” or “channeling” claims, nor “abduction” phenom- ena, but instead. examines the evidence that some extra-terrestrials may live among us in our communi- ties, appear- ing human. This month’s segment considers the more credible evidence that ET is already here. Credible Cases Explored If the foregoing cases (last month’s segment) were the sum of the evidence that extraterrestrials are already here it would indeed be foolhardy to even mention the subject. There are however at least six docu- mented cases that I believe are totally credible. I am unaware of any coher- ent claims to the contrary with any of them. I deal with them here chrono- logically: The earliest of these comes from the official history of Spain between the 15 th and 16 th Centuries, so there can be no doubt that it actually took place as recorded. Briefly, the story centers around a famous medical figure, Doctor Eugene Torralba , who was joined by an energetic young man with very pale skin and blond hair, named Zequiel, who offered to assist the doctor for the rest of his life. “El Rubio” (“the blonde”) as he came to be known, taught Torralba the use of herbs and various advanced practices as well as honesty in his dealings. Zequiel taught the doctor advanced theology, how to win at gambling and how to predict future events. The good doctor’s wealth and influence grew over the years. The culmination came with Torralba’s 1527 claim that with Zequiel’s help he had traveled from Spain to Rome and back by air in a single morning, carrying important news that only reached Spain more than a week later. Unsurprisingly, this drew the attention of the Spanish Inquisition who charged Torralba with witchcraft; under torture he was unable to deny what had happened. His young assistant of course was no longer to be found. This is one histori- cal enigma I see most explicable as extraterrestrial. 14 A less dramatic case, but just as impressive in other ways, comes from the account of Leo Dworshak (b.1920?) who as a young farmboy in North Dakota witnessed, with his brother, the frequent daytime landings of a large spaceship in a nearby valley from 1932 onwards. The craft carried several “men” whom the boys were able to gradually befriend and commu- nicate with, culminating in an invitation to go inside the ship. Meetings with the original crew in the ship happened four times and contact has continued to the present. As in the Coe case, Leo has had the experience of aging normally—he is now 85—while his friends still appear almost unchanged. Leo claims that this group has visited earth for thousands of years and currently has 48 of its people living among us on earth monitoring human activity. 15 In nearby Montana, in May 1940, another young man , Udo Wartena (1903-1989), also encountered an alien crew who landed. He was invited on board for several hours while they extracted a large quantity of water from a stream. Udo was told that the group, perhaps the same as encoun- tered by Leo Dworshak , “lived among us from to time” to monitor the progression and retrogression of earth society. Like Leo, Udo claimed that despite some differences, the men could easily pass as humans. They were quite forthcoming about their origin, their ages, their mission on earth and their propulsion system, but refused to discuss religion in any sense. This proved to be a one-time encounter, although Udo twice thought he caught glimpses of one of the men in the street. Wartena died in 1989, still hoping that he would see his friends again. 16 Some of the physical differences between extraterrestrials and our- selves have been recorded by a noted medical doctor, Dr. Leopoldo Diaz , head of surgery at a major hospital in Guadalajara, who had occasion to examine a man in his office in 1976. Requesting a medical examination because he traveled much, the man was examined by Dr. Diaz who quickly realized that he was not human. At this point his patient dis- closed the real reason for his visit. He had seemingly chosen a well-re- spected and influential figure to pass on the information that “many” people from his planet were here living undetected among us, trying to help us avert catastrophe. In a long conversa- tion he taught the doctor a great deal about religion, life after death and earth’s future before leaving and disappearing outside the building.

Nothing came of it however. 17 The story of Charles Hall (b. 1944) and his experiences while stationed as a range weather observer 1965–67 in the Nevada desert have only recently become widely known. In his work Hall encountered a base built into a mountain by the U.S. military for a large group of extrater- restrials, some of whom had seemingly been living on earth for the last few hundred years. At least one member of the group he met had been born here on earth. Dubbed by Hall the “Tall Whites” because of their skin color and unusual height, the group was providing technology to the military in exchange for rights to use the base. Large spacecraft arrived from their home planet on a regular schedule and he also observed smaller craft built on earth for local travel. With make-up and sunglasses, this race could move among us without difficulty, but it took Hall some time to be accepted by them and to be trusted. His interaction with the extraterrestrial men, women and children in many varied situations continued for about two years. More than once while on leave he recognized some of them enjoying the lights of Las Vegas. Fewer people are aware that Hall claims to have earlier encountered another alien group in the cooler surrounds of his native Wisconsin before entering the military. This group had apparently migrated to the U.S from Northern Europe where they had lived a long time after being stranded on earth. They appeared Scandina- vian, benign and, apart from the number of their teeth, totally human. 18 In his acclaimed autobiography, Air Marshall Sir Peter Horsley (1921-2001), the former Equerry to Prince Philip and an experienced pilot, tells how he was invited in 1954 to meet a quietly spoken man named “Janus” at the home of a London clairvoyant. In a long discussion Janus proceeded to eloquently and compre- hensively explain the universe, the origin of life and to accurately predict the future of man’s efforts in space and the role of extraterrestrials. He gave quite a detailed discussion about how “observers” from other worlds were able to come and live among us. He intimated that he himself was one of them and toward the end of the meeting Horsley found that Janus had the ability to read his mind. The event was reported to the Palace but efforts to locate Janus and the people who set up the meeting were in vain. 19 The man described as the “Father of Space Travel,” Herman Oberth (1894-1989), left a statement that suggests some kind of extraterrestrial assistance to the early U.S space program, stating that “we have been helped.” When asked by whom, Oberth stated “by the people of other worlds.” 20 His fellow scientist, Werner von Braun (1912-1977), notable for leading the development of the Saturn moon rocket, also left statements suggesting that earth’s space efforts received some discreet assistance from others. 21 I find little reason to doubt the claim by Bob Dean that while serving at NATO headquarters in Belgium in 1964 he saw a thick assessment of the alien situation from a military perspec- tive, including the information that four alien races (a very modest number!) were known to be visiting earth. According to Dean, one of the races were of concern because they were indistinguishable from humans and thus could easily infiltrate security. 22 There are a great many other cases that have many aspects in common with the six cases I have just summarized. They are harder to assess, but I list some here briefly. In 1971, Robert Hurlburt claimed to have met a young man on the fourth day of a long hike in the Vermont mountains. The man, slim, tall and seemingly in his mid-twenties, accompanied him and that evening introduced the subject of extraterres- trial life, soon disclosing that he was from another world. His world was described in great detail and Hurlburt was shown a small communication device which seemed to confirm that his new friend was indeed from elsewhere. Hurlburt later confirmed that the young man had also had contact with a young lady in his hometown but investigators were unable to verify this. 23 The odyssey of Prof. Hernandez is surely one of the strangest encoun- ters on record. A tenured professor in nuclear physics at the University of Mexico and a member of his coun- tries’ Atomic Energy Commission, Hernandez received telepathic infor- mation that brought him recognition in another field, immunology. In 1972 he met the source of this information, an attractive young woman calling herself Elyense. Eventually confiding her origin, she took him aboard a space- craft on four occasions and disclosed that her race was but one of many alien groups visiting and living on earth. Their meetings continued over several years, but for his disclosures the professor was placed in an insane asylum. Not long after his release, he vanished without trace in 1984. 24 Next Month: More credible cases, plus humans living with extraterrestri- als, and ET Strategy.

Book Reviews Seed of Knowledge, Stone of Plenty By John Burke & Kaj Halberg, Council Oak Books, San Franciso/Tulsa, 2005, hardback, 6x9, 255 pages, $26.95. Available from Amazon for $20.48. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly The authors of this very interesting book present a thesis, backed by scientific instrumentation and experi- ments, that the ancient pyramids, mounds, rock chambers and henges were as much about food production as about religion. Readers may be somewhat familiar with one of the authors, John Burke, because of his work with crop circles. He is the “B” in the original BLT research team of (John) B urke, (Will- iam) L evengood, and (Nancy) T albott. Through Levengood’s experiments with collected plants, primarily from crop circles, it was determined that some sort of electrical energy was affecting seeds collected from the sites. Depending on the maturity level of the plants and other factors, some seeds were posi- tively affected (better germination and growth) and some were negatively affected. Although Levengood had worked on the electrophysiology of seeds from crop circles and animal mutilation sites for more than a decade, he and Burke eventually developed a commercial application for treating seeds with electromagnetic energy. In this process, seeds are exposed to specific amounts of “a shower of electrons” for a specific period of time. Burke describes this as “not micro- waves or irradiation, but something far gentler, more akin to static electricity...” In spite of the low power of this electromagnetism, the treatment “improved seed performance dramati- cally,” says Burke. Seeds reportedly germinated faster, grew through the seedling stage more quickly, matured more quickly in the field, and were more resistant to all kinds of stress. They produced significantly more per acre, without chemi- cals. Too much of this energy is harmful, so a delicate balance must be reached – and this varies with the crops. Moreover, the effect on the seeds is not immediate, requiring about 30 days to fully develop after the treatment. The authors say that something very similar to this is what happened to seeds treated in pyramids, mounds and rock chambers by the ancients, and accounts for the fact that those people who had the imposing structures seemed to be richer than their neigh- bors, despite having no other apparent advantages. Continued on page 11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"      11 MUFON UFO Journal June 2007 In other words, they tapped into an electromagnetic energy. This energy, moreover, was present because of a combination of natural land features and specific engineering by the ancients who built the structures. How did the ancients know where the natural energy was located? Burke theorizes that some individuals, perhaps the shamans and medicine men, are able to feel this energy. Then, through observation and trial and error, they were able to build structures such as pyramids and mounds to intensify this natural energy. In addition to building with special rocks which aided the flow of electro- magnetic energy, the ancients also discovered that running water through some of the structures created addi- tional energy. They modified the natural site in some cases by digging a henge (a C-shaped ditch) to block the natural flow of energy along the ground in key locations and direct it into a structure. In order to test their theory, Burke and Halberg traveled to approximately 80 different sites, including Carnac, Avebury, Stonehenge, assorted North American structures, and Mesoameri- can pyramids. Using a magnetometer and electrostatic voltmeter they took hundreds of readings. These readings clearly show that an unusual amount of electromagnetic energy was indeed present at these pyramids, mounds, rock chambers and other structures. The authors also discovered that energy levels varied during pre-dawn, sunrise, afternoon and nighttime measurements. As often reported at crop circle sites, the authors occasionally observed balls of light or glow around the structures. But readings alone would not prove that the structures could affect crop production, so the authors exposed native seeds to the energies at these sites. When Levengood then tested these seeds, he found that they showed significantly improved growth—some- times producing three times the normal yield—thus seeming to validate Burke’s theory. It seems the Mayans knew what they were talking about when they called their pyramids “maize moun- tains.” Although this book grew out of BLT’s work, Burke never mentions crop circles. He does thank Talbott for “helping us in different ways,” and of course notes that Levengood’s work “was vital to this volume.” Seed of Knowledge, Stone of Plenty is extensively referenced, has a decent index, and includes a helpful glossary of terms. For those who want to do their own experiments, there are 43 pages of electromagnetic energy locations in the U.S., Canada and England open to the public. The authors describe the best instruments to use in measuring these energies. Those fascinated with this topic will find no similar book. It is as interesting as it is informative. Book Reviews Continued from page 10 The Science of E x t r a t e r r e s t r i a l s By Eric Julien, 2006. ISBN 1-60177- 101-0. Translated from the French into English by Estherella Carstens. Reviewed by Dr. Ali Fant When studying this book, I was reminded of the Book of Urantia. The reviewed book purports “an attempt to provide an answer to all the arguments and twilight zones that have stopped us from grasping the UFO phenomenon and those who pilot them.” The author believes the 1945 atomic bomb explosions created a timequake signal for time travelers. UFOs are timeships piloted by ExtraTemporals – and they are mad at us for our warlike tendencies. The author explains from personal visits with UFO time travelers such items as crop circles, Remote Viewing, and the ongoing war of ET versus Earth. A pacifist approach to ETs is advised because mankind deserves whatever the time travelers dish out: abduction, sexual experi-mentation, mutilation, poltergeists, etc. Researchers believing ETs are extraterrestrial races are labeled the lunatic fringe on page 375. Technical diagrams abound in the book, but the author explains very few. He writes, “The texts and diagrams are complimentary without always addressing the same things or addressing them in the same way,” page 11. This sounds a little like a lazy writer stating “AND IT CAN BE SHOWN” before giving unsubstan- tiated conclusions. Factual errors included Japan surrendering before Hiroshima was bombed and science consists only of theories to be vali- dated. In truth, both Germany and Japan desired to surrender condit- ionally (keeping their military forces intact) before being defeated on the battlefield. The author is a former air traffic controller and an airport manager for Paris (France) airports. The test is written at a university reading level and includes many references to Schrodigen’s Equation, Quantum Mechanics, Laplace Transforms, and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principal. Because all human perceptions are time- based, the UFO time travelers alter our reality to suit their purposes. I do not recommend this book for scientific readers because it is more metaphysical than physical.

Behrendt, 2007. Bloomington, IN. Authorhouse. 382 pages. Reviewed by Ron Zack Kenneth W. Behrendt, a chemist by trade and a student of physics, scientifically examines the technology of UFOs. In the tradition of true science, he works backwards from observable phenomena relating to UFOs, to construct a theory that will explain all of those observations and reports. Those observations include UFO flight, propulsion, appearance, disappearance, landing, and even associated occurrences such as animal mutilations. The basic explanation for these observed and reported phenomena is found in anti-mass field theory. In the introduction, the author describes three versions of the theory. In an only partially successful effort at simplifying the science, he bases the remainder of the book on the intermediate version—the “non- electromagnetic radiation” version. The theory explains how extraterrestrial technology can artificially control the gravitational and inertial properties of large UFO craft and crews. Through the use of an anti-mass field generator, the mass of the craft and crew can be cancelled, allowing operation outside limitations imposed by the theory of relativity. By thus eliminating turbulence and drag, UFOs can appear to hover, float, rapidly accelerate, achieve hyper-light travel velocities and produce other effects such as the spectral glows often observed around craft hulls. The structure and location aboard ship of the anti-mass field generator is described in the first chapter. The remaining 18 chapters, originally written as free-standing magazine articles and edited to conform to the intermediate version of the anti-mass field theory, explain many aspects of UFO operation, ET exploration and encounters between humanoids and humans. Several individual experiences, previously reported in the UFO literature, are explained. For example, chapter 11 relates the experience of Herbert Schirmer, a Nebraska patrolman who boarded an alien craft in 1967. He described a crystal rotor, the operation of which he observed aboard the ship. Behrendt shows how such a device can be used to generate an anti-mass field. At times, the science seems difficult to comprehend without some background knowledge of physics. The reader may benefit from a basic understanding of scientific concepts such as cyclotron radiation, ionized plasma particles, Lorentz forces, piezoelectric effect, gravitons and antigravitons. However, if the reader can get past the technical detail and occasional jargon, the chapters of this book offer a lucid description of the structure and function of UFOs, life aboard alien craft, explanations of many phenomena associated with UFOs (animal mutilations, invisibility, interpenetrability, compass reactions), and even a design for a craft that can duplicate the technology of the ETs.

Friedman Stanton Friedman On the Bible and UFOs; Scientific Knowledge Frequently, after I appear on a popular call-in radio show such as Coast to Coast with George Noory , I receive loads of email and telephone calls. I always give out my website www.stantonfriedman.com and my email address fsphys@rogers.com . I don’t dare give out my phone number while on the air because I would be deluged with calls, making conversation difficult during the show. But my phone number is at the website. I am always on the lookout for new witnesses, of Roswell or otherwise, and am especially hopeful of hearing from former military pilots willing to talk to me about their close encounters and those of which they have heard wherein pilots were apparently zapped by UFOs they were attacking. A number of these are discussed in Frank Feschino Junior’s exciting new book Shoot Them Down due out this summer (and for which I wrote the foreword and epilog). UFO sightings in the Bible Of course, I always get questions about many other topics. There have been quite a number relating to the Bible and UFOs. My standard response is to refer people to Dr. Barry Downing’s excellent book The Bible and Flying Saucers. Barry has a BS in Physics and a Doctor of Divinity degree. He had his own church in Endwell, New York, for more than thirty years and is a consultant to MUFON. He even appears in the Canadian TV Documentary Stanton T. Friedman IS Real by Paul Kimball. Barry researched both the Old and New Testaments and found many instances of what we would today call UFO sightings. He also found that it was difficult to discuss such matters with his religious colleagues, who often simply wouldn’t discuss the subject. It seems to me that, if one is impressed with the wonders God hath wrought on this one planet in the vast universe, it would be even more impressive to think of a galaxy in which there are many sentient beings in God’s image. I must admit that many years ago, perhaps because of meeting Erik Von Daniken, I looked at Genesis 19, the story of angels or strangers meeting with Abraham, telling him that his wife, Sarah, despite her age, would give birth to a son a year later. They also visited Abraham’s nephew, Lot, in Sodom, the wicked city. Remember Abraham pleaded that the city shouldn’t be destroyed if there were 50 decent men, or 45, or 30 and finally 10.The strangers visit Lot and the Sodomites demand that Lot turn them over to the Sodomites. Lot even offers his two virgin daughters instead of the angels. (I wonder if there is a PhD thesis about that discussion.) Anyway the Sodomites demand them and note that Lot himself had been a stranger and should not be defying them. They come charging at Lot’s door. The strangers make a bright light which blinds the Sodomites (temporarily according to one commentary). The strangers tell Lot to take his family and flee because Sodom will be destroyed. Only Lot’s wife and two daughters pay heed to his request. These four are told to “get ye to the Hills lest ye be swept away; don’t look back.” They flee, but Lot’s wife does look back, and gets turned into a pillar of salt. Soon Abraham notes fire and brimstone over the city and smoke coming up as the smoke from a furnace or kiln. The last scenes are really strange. Lot’s daughters are somehow aware that the men in their new location are apparently sterile, and agree to get their father drunk and seduce him on separate nights. They each become pregnant and their sons each create a tribe without any hint of castigation even though incest has already been strongly denounced. What really destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah? It seemed to me that there were a number of strange aspects that could be explained by our current knowledge of advanced technology (about which the translators, who created the King James version of the Old Testament, could not have been aware). With advanced reproduction techniques a number of woman have become pregnant in their old age. A bright blinding temporary light sounds like a laser or other electrical device. Nuclear weapon explosions produce fireballs, mushroom clouds, etc. They Continued on page 15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"      15 MUFON UFO Journal June 2007 Friedman: The Bible and UFOs Continued from page 14 Continued on page 20 also produce shock waves which knock things and people down if they are not protected. The eyes are one of the most vulnerable parts of the body upon exposure to weapons radiation. Sterility is not an uncommon effect of high doses of radiation. Some people out in the open at Hiroshima were turned into pillars of salt. I found, when looking at several different versions of the Old Testament, such as the Masoretic Text and the commentaries, that there are a number of differences in small detail. Obviously the devil is in the details. One of my objections to Josef Blumrich’s book The Spaceships of Ezekiel is that he blindly accepted the King James version without any linguistic evaluations. I had the lucky opportunity to discuss my views with an old friend, Biblical scholar Dr. Sheldon Blank, a Professor at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati whom I got to know when living in the area. Sheldon did his own translations. He didn’t object to my interpretation. I decided it would probably take several months to do even a small monograph on my ideas—time I didn’t have. Later I heard a professor and his wife at a UFO conference talk about perhaps ten different ancient civilizations they had reviewed. All had stories of space beings coming down to earth in craft from the sky. The people who knew the old languages insisted they were not gods, but beings. Obviously the King James translation was done long before we had any knowledge about non-natural reproduction or nuclear weapons or lasers. Old beliefs, new knowledge Our knowledge has grown in many areas that make it much easier to talk about past visitations of advanced technological beings. We no longer accept the notion of Irish Protestant Bishop James Ussher (1581-1656) who calculated (frankly, in a meticulous scholarly fashion) that the world was created in 4004 BC on October 23. This conclusion was based on tracing back the generations of the Old Testament. Even in 1900 Lord Kelvin, a great scientist, had said that the solar system was not more than 10 million years old because the sun could only consume so much fuel before it ran out. Now we know the earth is roughly 4.5 billion years old and that our galaxy, ...ten ancient civilizations they had reviewed all had stories of space beings coming down to earth in craft from the sky. Their writings insisted they were not gods, but beings. the Milky Way (with its hundreds of billions of stars, many with planets) and the universe are at least 13 billion years old. We thought there was only one galaxy until roughly the 1920s, when it became accepted that the Nebula were other galaxies, not merely clouds. The point here is that suddenly, it was not a crazy or heretic idea to think of there having been many other civilizations created or developed long before ours and that the notion of interstellar flight is not silly once one acknowledges nuclear fusion as the source of energy for all the stars. I worked on both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion propulsion systems. Every advanced civilization would know about fusion, because it is the source of energy for all the stars, and undoubtedly would also know about a host of other unknown and— miraculous to us primitives—areas of technology. Views on UFOS by Religious groups and the government I must also admit that religion also plays a role in my answers to another Frequently Asked Question: “Why isn’t the government telling us what it knows about flying saucers?” This is one of a number of “Why” questions I address in a paper “The UFO Why Questions” on my website. One reason for the government coverup is that certain religious fundamentalists, such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, have very publicly proclaimed that the only place in the universe on which there is intelligent life is Planet Earth. They claim all this UFO stuff is the work of the devil. They have been very close to those in political power and would be up the creek without a religious paddle if an announcement about alien reality were made. It certainly would be devilish to create all the physical trace cases, the multiple witness radar visual sightings, and such excellent abduction cases as the Betty and Barney Hill case (described in the new book Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience by Kathleen Marden (Betty’s niece) and myself). Frankly, one might well ask: is there intelligent life on earth? Are we the best that God can do? Something is surely wrong on this planet where 30,000 children die needlessly of preventable disease or starvation every day. Yet the United States, the most powerful weapons-laden nation the Earth has ever seen (in the last several thousand years anyway), spends roughly half a trillion dollars per year on things military.

This month we look at a very recent series of sightings here in Missouri. The cases are still in the investigative stage because sightings continue to occur. This report represents a summary of events on April 9 and 16. Additional information will be presented as it is gathered. On April 22, 2007, the primary witnesses contacted Bruce Widaman, the Missouri MUFON State Director, with details relating to two observations which involved video of some of the activity. Bruce contacted me and I talked with the witnesses. The primary witnesses, T and N, husband and wife, asked that their names and the exact location remain confidential. They were not going to report the first event but after the second felt the observations might be significant and having the video supported their experiences. N and T produced sketches and descriptions and both agreed they were accurate. N describes the sightings in her own words: “On April 9 th at 9:40 PM I was watching my miniature horses in the barn. I was standing about 300 feet from the east tree line behind our house facing northeast. I saw a red light as bright as the cell tower lights (the cell tower is 1/2 mile south of our property). The red light didn’t flash and seemed low to the ground. After a short time it suddenly went out. Then from left to right I saw 4 or 5 bright orange lights, shaped like small rectangles. They reminded me of rectangular tail lights from a car, but brighter and longer top to bottom than from side to side. Those lights were a little farther north than the red light had been but not much. They lit up one at a time and by the time the third one lit up the first one went out and so forth. Then nothing. Then the orange ones lit up again, but there were 5 or 6 this time. Same thing, left to right and the first one went out by the time the third one lit. That was all that I saw that night. I did not report it to anyone but my husband and daughter.” After talking with N, I photographed the area and recorded the location of the lights with a digital compass—70 degrees.

It was just sitting there. The lights this time were really bright, lighting up whatever it was. We slowed down but didn’t stop until we got home. It was a dark night with no stars out. We have lived here all our lives and never seen anything like this.” Same night, same time, description very close to N’s which had not been reported. Using GPS Expert I projected a line from the location of N’s sighting to a point just east of Hwy 65 at a point one mile south of Cross Timbers. The azimuth was 70 degrees, a perfect match. There was no chance theach couple’s observation could have been known by the other couple. The lights return a week later N describes the next event: “On April 16, 2007, my husband was home and we were checking the horses. I had a feeling the lights were there again and they were. Again a red light first; it went out; then a whole bunch of lights again lighting up in sequence left to right. I have a drawing that my husband and I both agree [represents] what we saw. This time the sighting went on for about an hour, give or take. It started at 9:20 p.m. and by the time we called my mother and father-in-law and they came 3 miles on dirt roads to get there [the lights] were done. About an hour passed before we decided to call them. “The April 16 th sighting was longer, and more sequences of lights and they all were the same left to right, but this time the lights looked like little fireballs, except one of them went from right to left. And one of them was directly in the east. Like this: sequence of....lights, then sequence of 9 or 10 lights, then the ones that went right to left, then the ones in the east that we video taped on night vision, they were different shape, color, direction, etc. Then the last four of which we got video of two of them. “All of the lights were orange after the first red one, except the ones in the east. They were more yellow to white and show up on the video as white, but like bright yellow fading to white. It was all like some code maybe from one set of lights to another, then an answer and then they vanished. “These lights all went in a semi- circular pattern as though they were going around a circular object.” (See Cross Timbers description.) The lights appeared in 10 different patterns, after the fifth pattern, T went to the house to get the camera. The first video shows one of the lights in the east as he came out of the house. The second video clip shows the last (10 th ) two lights seen in that segment of the observation. The clips show several fainter and smaller lights moving in the area of the brighter display. Another red light was seen between N and T’s location and a thick line of trees 500 feet away. It was again low to the ground and in front of the trees. The sightings continue I received an email May 20 th from N telling me of another sighting last night in which more video was taken. This is now under investigation; our SIU team is ready to return there with a lot of photographic equipment should these events continue.

With the proper analysis, the results will further clarify the UFO mystery. Many Ufologists go on “hunting expeditions.” The lucky ones who find their UFO quarry should follow some tips so that their videotape can be most useful. Use the “SP” tape speed if available when recording and on copies. Longer speeds lose quality, and the added record time (typically two hours) is rarely relevant in a UFO case. Move to put the UFO momen- tarily behind a terrestrial reference object— the further away the reference, the better. Tree branches or telephone poles are often available. If the UFO is exhibiting anomalous motion, this can only be verified if a tripod is used, or something else is in the frame for comparison. I’ve seen videos with audio claiming “I’m holding real still!” with a UFO showing wild motion. But a barely visible star shows the same wild motion, showing how “still” an excited person really is. A perfectly honest witness can’t be trusted; only a reference can. If possible, zoom back to include a streetlight or radio tower light. Possible rotation of the camcorder (rare) or zoom usage (common) can only be verified with two reference points in the frame. Describe what you see, anything you do with the cam- corder, the time, wind, temperature, direction, and anything else that comes to mind. A blank audio track is worth- less. Since the viewfinder of most camcorders is black and white, the above mentioned infrared “whitening” of the UFO image won’t be noticed until later. If the UFO color is men- tioned on the audio, this can aid infra- red determination. If UFO structure can be deduced, alternate between a close zoom for structure and a far zoom if reference objects are visible. Lock your autofocus to “infinity” and leave it there unless the UFO shows up as a bright overexposed dot. Bright dots are very common. In this case, other techniques are useful: 1. Run the focus slowly through its range so color, brightness, and twinkle measurements can be made. 2. With proper focus, sweep the camera back and forth to generate motion streaks. 3. Switch the camera electronic shutter through its exposure ranges; many cameras will cycle from 1/30 to 1/1000 second exposure. Some setting may give a useful result. 4. Stabilize the camera so UFO motion can be determined. The best hand- held is not good enough. A tripod, or placement on a stable surface with proper aim, is needed. Don’t bother using heavy digital zoom. This reduces the field of view, adds no resolution, and adds no magni- fication that can’t be done by video analysis equipment. Some digital zoom, 2X or so, may compensate for limited recording resolution of the tape. Unless your camcorder has limited tape or battery capacity, never stop recording during a UFO event. Even if nothing useful is seen, continuous recording allows proper timing, and catches useful sound on the audio track. A plane won’t be visible for a half-hour, and a balloon borne flare won’t burn for more than about eight minutes, but these timings can’t be done with intermittent recording. If reference objects are in the frame, or you say what you are doing on the audio track, rotate the camera so that video artifacts rotate and are thus identified. If you have a tape which has poor sync (synchronization, either horizontal or vertical), don’t give up. Poor sync will generate a broken up freeze-frame, horizontal jags, crazed color or worse. All this can make analysis difficult. Sync-restoration equipment and professional VHS decks can do wonders with these problem tapes, and the resultant dubs can give excellent freeze-frames even with home quality VCRs. A professional studio, TV station, or your MUFON video analyst may have this capability. Video Analysis Although the logical processes in video analysis are the same as any other field of investigative science, the number of questions fielded by investigators makes it obvious that these techniques are not universally known. Since a college degree in Ufology is not obtainable, the lack of this knowledge might be expected. With apologies to the trained reader, I will explain methods I use in video analysis. A “good” UFO case results in an unknown, since UFO characteristics are not understood. The analyst can’t say what a UFO video “should” show; only what it shouldn’t show. This implies a process of elimination; lens flares, aircraft, frauds, stars, satellites, etc. must be eliminated as a cause of the event. To paraphrase Sherlock Holmes, if all conventional explanations fall short, what remains, however improbable, is “Unidentified.” (By no means does this prove that the unknown contains green men from Mars!) Many pages of evidence and logic may be needed to eliminate only one possibility; proper science can be tedious. A UFO case may result in a conclusion that the evidence is insufficient to eliminate some conven- tional object. For example, a blinking UFO video may show nothing to eliminate airplane strobe lights. This does not prove the video shows a plane, only that a plane would fully Video and Photo Analysis Continued from page 5 Continued on page 19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"      19 MUFON UFO Journal June 2007 explain the video. A painful number of “explanations” of UFO cases fail to account for the evidence, and I implore the reader to reject “explanations” which do not explain all the data. UFO video shooting is an ongoing process and I continue to receive tapes of stars, planes, ambiguous blobs, lens flares, and recognizable unconventional objects. Exciting cases are not yet complete. Science supersedes sensa- tionalism, so the patient process of testing various methods of fakery or misidentification must be completed before publication. I hope the reader will understand that the more convincing the evidence, the more carefully it must be tested before release for scrutiny by the public. Analysis, Fraud and Unseen Analysis, Fraud and Unseen Analysis, Fraud and Unseen Analysis, Fraud and Unseen Analysis, Fraud and Unseen Objects Objects Objects Objects Objects At the 1996 MUFON Sympo- sium, Jeff Sainio followed up with a paper titled: “X(-Files), Lies, and Videotape; A Photo-Video Update.” Excerpt follows: Many video cases are claimed to be anomalous, based on the unusual “structure” seen in extreme blowups of a bright point in the sky. A dark bottom or side is seen, often flickering. This is declared to be an “energy ring” or “power vortex.” (This is a warning sign—pseudoscientific terms in conclusions by the witness, rather than “just the facts.”) Professional equipment or a camera with digital zoom is used for the blowup. Complete scientific analysis involves a control experiment or reference. This involves videotaping an object similar-looking to the UFO, using the same equipment if possible. If the original equipment is unavailable, an object resembling the UFO might be found on the same videotape. If a known object has the same “anomalous” characteristics as the UFO, the anomaly is merely due to the equipment, not the UFO. Failure to perform a control experiment is the most common error of novice investigators. Despite what you see on fictional shows such as X-Files , the “infinite- resolution” method of photo enhance- ment is just that: fiction. An extreme blowup of a tiny blob will result in a large blob. No more detail will be gleaned. Any “detail” found will probably be mere artifacts. The resolution of film is limited by the focus and film grain, and for videotape, by the scan lines forming the image and the response characteristics of the tape. The rule to remember is that no amount of enhancement can extract informa- tion that isn’t there. Many “anomalous” features of tiny videotaped objects are simply the scan lines forming the image, and tiny features of film images are merely the grain. Digital zoom may give a “blocky” result which is easily recognized, but more professional equipment may perform blowups that look quite clean. In the case of the dark “power vortex” below a bright point, a control experiment finds that many camcorders create exactly such a dark bottom on any small bright object, such as Venus or a distant streetlight. The “energy ring” is simply an artifact of the camcorder, and means little. An abuse of analysis is to deter- mine three-dimensional shape from an image. Another rule to remember is that an unknown object’s three- dimensional shape cannot be deter- mined from a picture of it. The proof of this is simple; just look at the picture. It is a flat piece of paper (Duh!), but looks like the UFO. Therefore, the UFO could be perfectly flat as well (or umpteen other shapes), and look the same. Possible Fraud Perhaps fueled by the increase in popularity of daytime talk shows, fraudulent cases are more commonly seen. Generally, these cases require no analytic expertise to recognize. Another rule to remember is that the validity of a cases is inversely proportional to the money involved. This is obviously not science, merely my experience. When the witness attempts to get bathed in publicity, hop on the talk-show circuit, and sell videos at $39.95 apiece, be sure to scrutinize the evidence very carefully. Fraud should not be suspected merely in witnesses; unfortunately, investigators’ and analysts’ work should be checked as well. Professionalism demands that any suspicions be presented to the suspect before making public statements. I believe the public should be aware that early UFO photo analysts may have themselves been fraudulent. As an example of this, consider an enhancement of one of Rex Heflin’s famous photos. The enhancement appears to be a fraudulent analysis; a string is blatantly apparent. My repetition of the analysis using the same prints, showed no evidence of a string even at higher levels of contrast-enhancement. One of the prints showed a scratch in the area of the “string,” but could not have been on the original because it only appeared on one print. Nor was the scratch as long as the “string” in the enhancement. Where the “string” would connect to the UFO is below the top of the UFO; glare at the “string” connection-point makes the “top” of the UFO appear to be lower than it really is. A round model connected to a string at the point shown, would not hang horizontally. The “string” was apparently painted into the enhance- Video/Photo Analysis Continued from page 18 Continued on page 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"June 2007 20 MUFON UFO Journal Friedman: On the Bible and UFOs Continued from page 15 certainly feed all those starving kids and many more. I should point out that there are many religious groups on the planet who do accept the notion of other civilizations “out there.” These include the Hindus, the Buddhists and the Mormons. Even Catholic Father Baldacci at the Vatican has spoken out at conferences as recently as this past April in San Marino, Italy. He can find no objection to the notion of visiting aliens. Do recall that it took 300 years for the church to more or less accept the Copernican idea that the Earth is NOT the center of the Universe, but instead, the universe revolved around the sun. Now we know that that notion makes no sense either. One of the “Why” questions I am often asked is why would aliens come here without just landing on the White House lawn? I discuss this in detail on my website, but will just point out that, from an alien view, this is surely a primitive society whose major activity is tribal warfare. Perhaps this is the Devil’s Island of this corner of the galaxy. Other civilizations dumped their bad boys and girls here and that is why we are so nasty to each other. Don’t forget Australia and Georgia were both originally settled by convicts. Stanton Friedman fsphys@rogers.com www.stantonfriedman.com ment to be more impressive. The lesson to be learned is that every Ufologist should look at the evidence, check expert logic, and trust nobody. Not even me. (Editor’s note: Ann Druffel now has possession of the original Rex Heflin photos so modern computer enhancement and photo analysis may be conducted.) Investigators often submit photo/ video cases with missing documentation. Especially with photos, the image is just a small part of the case and cannot be judged by itself. The witness testimony must be checked for consistency against the visual evidence. Unseen Objects on Film In film, the most common submission is that of an unseen object. Only when the film is developed is an object seen; usually a bright blob or a diffused spot. Often many “UFOs” are found on the print. These cases aren’t cause for excitement for two reasons: first, this scenario is typical of a defect causing the image; secondly, Ufology attempts to learn from the evidence, and there is little to learn from an unseen, diffused blob. Unseen objects on film are such a common submission that, despite some repetition from my earlier paper on photo analysis, I will point out common points to take note of. 1. The photo will be a typical “tourist” photo of something worth shooting. The UFO position can be anywhere in the picture. The position can be important because witnesses may embellish their testimony and state that they saw the UFO. Normally a witness will attempt to center any object of interest in the frame. If the UFO is badly centered, be suspicious if the testimony does not explain why. 2. If the photo is of a sunset or other bright object, consider a lens flare. Flares are simply stray reflections and have these characteristics (assuming a sunset): a. They are always brighter than the background, b. If there are several, they often form a line pointed toward the sunset. Often, the line passes through the center of the photo. The flares grow larger and weaker with distance from the sun. c. The light source need not appear in the photo; light merely needs to shine on the lens to cause a flare. d. They are the same color as the sunset; perhaps redder, since the sunset itself may be overexposed and therefore appear whiter than it really is. 3. An “unseen” object may be actually an ignored object. Insects, birds, blowing snow/spiderweb/ cottonseeds backlit by the sun, speed-limit signs from a moving car (always ignored!), or blowing leaves must be considered as causes of an unseen object. If they were moving through the frame, they will be motion-smeared and therefore difficult to recognize. 4. If the UFO image is a lens flare or film defect, there will often be more flares in the same photo, or more defects in the same roll of film. These defects are often missed by the witness. One must merely look carefully over the photos.

Congratulations to Kenneth E. Cherry (Texas), Tracey C. Smith (Kansas), Donald R. Burleson (New Mexico) for being 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively in the month of April. The report is based on our two measures of UFO Investigation effectiveness. Assigning reports within 48 hours of receipt, and completing all investigations within 60 days of being assigned. The “Assigned” column is a six month running average of the number of cases assigned within 48 hours divided by the total number of cases received in that six month period. The “Completed” column is the number of cases completed beginning sixty-two (62) days back and going back six months from there (for a total of eight months back) divided by the total number of cases reported in the same period. The “Weighted Rank” is just the average of the two columns expressed as a percent. State Directors can improve their scores by being sure to assign all cases within 48 hours, and by follow- ing up with their Field Investigators to ensure all reports are completed within 60 days. To be considered complete a report must have been investigated and placed in one of the three com- pleted status codes (Unknown, Hoax or IFO) by you the State Director.
