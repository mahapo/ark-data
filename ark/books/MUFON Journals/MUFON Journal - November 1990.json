This rhythm was first discovered in 1924 by the German psychiatrist Hans Berger, who recorded cerebral voltages as part of a telepathy study. 39 He noted two distinct frequencies: alpha (8-13 cycles per second), associated with a relaxed, alert state, and beta (14-30 cycles per second), produced during states of agitation and intense mental concentration. Later, other rhythms were noted, which are particularly im- portant for our present purposes: theta (4-7 cycles per second), a hypnogogic state, and delta (.5 to 3.5 cycles per se- cond), generally found in sleeping sub- jects. 40 The hemi-synch, and related mind machines, can produce alpha or theta waves, on demand, according to the operator's wishes. A suitably-entrained brain is much more responsive to sug- gestion, and is even likely to experience vivid hallucinations. I have spoken to several UFO ab- ductees who describe a \"stereophonic sound\" effect, exactly similar to that produced by the hemi-synch, preceding many \"encounters.\" Of course, one usually administers the hemi-synch via headphones, but I see no reason why the effect cannot be transmitted via the above-described stimoceiver. Again, I remind the reader of the ab- ductee with an implant, just inside her ear canal. There's more than one way to entrain a brain. Michael Hutchison's excellent book, Mega Brain, details the author's personal experiences with many such devices: The Alphastim, TENS, the Synchro-energizer, Tranquilite, etc. He recounts dazzling, Dali-esque hallu- cinations as a result of using this mind- expanding technology. Hutchison avoids an important ques- tion: What about the possibility of an outside operator literally \"changing our minds\" by altering our brainwaves without our knowledge or permission? If these machines can induce a hypnotic state, what's to stop a skilled hypnotist from making use of this state? Granted, most of these devices re- quire some physical interaction with the subject. But a tool called the Bio-Pacer can, according to its manufacturer, pro- duce a number of mood altering fre- quencies without attachment to the sub- ject. Indeed, the Bio-Pacer III (a high- powered version) can affect an entire room. This device costs $275, accord- ing to the most recent price sheet available. 41 What sort of machine might $27,500 buy? Or $275,000? What ef- fects, what ranges might a million- dollar machine be capable of? T he military certainly has that sort of money, and they're cer- tainly interested in this sort of technology, according to Michael Hut- chison. His interview with an informant named Joseph Light elicited some par- ticularly provocative revelations. Ac- cording to Light: \"There are important elements in the scientific community, powerful people, who are very much interested in these areas ... but they have to keep most of their work secret. Because as soon as they start to publish some of these sen- sitive things, they have problems in their lives. You see, they work on research grants, and if you follow the research being done, you find that as soon as these scientists publish something about this, their research funds are cut off. There are areas in bioelectric research where very simple techniques and devices can have mind- boggling effects. Conceivably, if you have a crazed person with a bit of a technical background, he can do a lot of damage.\" 42 \"Wavie\" Files Every Senator and Congressional representative has a \"wavie\" file. So do many state representatives. Wavies even have pled their case to private institu- tions such as The Christian Institute. 43 And who are the wavies? They claim to be the victims of clandestine bombardment with non- ionizing radiation, or microwaves. They report sudden changes in psychological states,\" alteration of sleep patterns, in- tracerebral voices and other sounds, and physiological effects. Most people never realize how many wavies there are in this country. Are these troubled individuals seek- ing an exterior rationale for their men- tal problems? Maybe. Indeed, I'm sure that such is the case in many instances. But the fact is that the literature on the behavioral effects of microwaves, extra-low-frequencies (ELF) and ultra- sonics is such that we cannot blithely dismiss all such claims. And, despite the censor's heavy hand, we know from the available documents that the CIA has involved itself with this research since the days of ARTICHOKE. The Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has continued this work. What can low-level microwaves do to the mind? According to a DIA report released MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"under the Freedom of Information Act, 44 microwaves can induce metabolic changes, alter brain functions and disrupt behavior patterns. PANDORA discovered that pulsed microwaves can create leaks in the blood/brain barrier, induce heart seizures, and create behavioral disorganization. 45 In 1970, a RAND corporation scientist reported that microwaves could be used to pro- mote insomnia, fatigue, irritability, memory loss and hallucinations. 46 Perhaps the most significant work in this area has been produced by Dr. W. Ross Adey at the University of Southern California. He determined that behavior and emotional states can be altered without electrodes, simply by placing the subject in an electromagnetic field. By directing a carrier frequency to stimulate the brain and using amplitude modulation to \"shape\" the wave into mimicry of a desired EEC frequency, he was able to impose a 4.5 Cycles Per Second theta rhythm on his subjects, a frequency which he previously measured in the hippocampus during avoidance learning. Thus, he could ex- ternally condition the mind towards an adversive reaction. 47 (Adey has also done extensive work on the use of elec- trodes in animals. 48 ) According to another prominent microwave scientist, Allen Frey, other frequencies could — in animal studies — induce docility. 49 Adey and compatriots have compil- ed an entire library of frequencies and pulsation rates which can affect the mind and nervous system. Some of these effects can be extremely bizarre. For example, engineer Tom Jarski, in an attempt to replicate the seminal work of F. Cazzamalli, found that a particular frequency caused a ringing sensation in the ears of his subjects, who then felt strangely compelled to bite the ex- perimenters! 50 On the other hand, the diet-conscious may be intrigued by the finding that rats exposed to ELF (extra- low-frequency) waves failed to gain weight normally. 51 For our present purposes, the most significant electromagnetic research findings concern microwave signals modulated by hypnoidal EEC frequen- cies. Microwaves can act much like the \"hemi-synch\" device previously According to a. DIA report released under the Freedom of Information Act, microwaves can induce metabolic changes, alter brain functions and disrupt behavior patterns. described, that is, they can entrain the brain to theta rhythms. 52 1 need not em- phasize the implications of remotely synchronizing the brain to resonate at a frequency conducive to sleep, or to hypnosis. Trance may be remotely induced, but can it be directed? Yes. Recall the intracerebral voices mentioned earlier in our discussion of Delgado. The same effect can be pro- duced by \"the wave.\" Frey demonstrated in the early 1960s that microwaves could produce booming, hissing, buzzing, and other in- tracerebral static (this phenomenon is now called \"the Frey effect\"); in 1973, Dr. Joseph Sharp, of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, expanded on Prey's work in an experiment where the subject, in this case, Sharp himself, \"heard\" and understood spoken words delivered via a pulsed-microwave analog of the speaker's sound vibra- tions. 53 Dr. Robert Becker comments that \"Such a device has obvious applications in covert operations designed to drive a target crazy with 'voices' or deliver undetectable instructions to a pro- grammed assassin.\" 54 In other words, we now have, at the push of a button, the technology either to inflict an elec- tronic Gaslight, or to create a true Man- churian Candidate. Indeed, the former capability could effectively disguise the latter. Who will listen to the victims, when the electronically-induced hallucinations they recount exactly parallel the classical signals of paranoid schizophrenia and/or temporal lobe epilepsy? Conversely, if the victims have been directed to view their pro- gramming sessions in ufological terms, only the saucer aficionados would take the claims seriously. Abductee implants would focus this electromagnetic energy. The father of the stimoceiver, Dr. J.M.R. Delgado, has recently conducted experiments in which he exposed monkeys to elec- tromagnetic fields, eliciting a wide range of behavioral effects. Fascin- atingly, when monkeys with brain im- plants felt \"the wave,\" the effects were greatly intensified. Apparently, these tiny electrodes can act as an amplifier of the electromagnetic effect. 55 T his last point is important to our \"alien abduction\" thesis. Critics might counter that any burst of microwave energy powerful enough to have truly remote effects would probably also create a thermal reaction. That is, if a clandestine operator propagated a \"wave\" from out- side an abductee's bedroom, say, from a low-flying helicopter, or from a truck travelling alongside the subject's car, the power necessary to do the job might be such that the microwave would cook the target before it got a chance to launder his thoughts. Delgado's work may give us our solu- tion. Once an abductee has been im- planted, the chip-in-the-brain would act as an intensifier of the signal. Such an individual could have any number of \"UFO\" experiences while his or her bed partner dozes comfortably. Helicopters and Discs Is it possible, then, that the \"mystery helicopters\" which plague abductees are actually part of a sophisticated elec- tromagnetic warfare system? Consider the common wisdom on the subject. Most ufologists assume that the black, unmarked helicopters reported (and even photographed) by Betty Andreasson-Luca and others serve some sort of surveillance purpose. But this explanation simply won't hold water, as anyone who has studied the history of domestic espionage can plainly see. I invite the reader to read up on the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Is it possible that \"my- stery helicopters\" are ac- tually part of a sophis- ticated electromagnetic warfare system? known surveillance programs con- ducted by our engines of national security during the past few decades. We now possess a growing literature on illegal programs such as COIN- TELPRO, CHAOS and GARDEN PLOT, in which the FBI, the CIA and the military violated both their charters and our constitutional liberties as they spied on dissident movements. The sins against the citizenry were, and, no doubt, still are, many and depressing. We read of mail interference. Bugging. Telephone taps. Undercover operatives. Agents provocateurs. But — where are the helicopters? As a moment's thought will tell you, helicopters would prove cumbersome and inefficient in a domestic sur- veillance operation. They draw atten- tion. They're highly expensive. Other espionage methods could retrieve much more data with far fewer problems. So why do UFO abductees, and not other alleged victims of home-grown spookery, report continual helicopter harassment? If the choppers aren't there to survey the scene, men they must serve some other purpose. What better way to bring an EMR device to the proposed EMR victim? Rex Niles Case In this regard, the bizarre story of Rex Niles and his sister (not named in news accounts) may shed interesting light on a variety of abductee cases, particularly that of Betty and Barney Hill. 56 Niles, the high-rolling owner of a Woodland Hills defense subcon- tracting firm (Rex Rep) was fingered by authorities investigating defense industry kickbacks. He became an ex- traordinarily cooperative witness in the investigation, until he was targeted by his enemies, who allegedly used psychoelectronics as harassment. The following excerpt from the Los Angeles Times article on Niles is par- ticularly compelling: \"He [Niles] has produced testimony from his sister, a Simi Valley woman who swears that helicopters have repeatedly circled her home. An engineer measured 250 watts of microwaves in the atmosphere outside Niles' house and found a radioactive disc underneath the dash of his car. \"A former high school friend, Lyn Silverman, claimed that her home com- puter went haywire when Niles stepped close to it.\" No aliens in this story, yet how similar it is to tales of alien abduction! Here we have the low-flying helicopters, in a case where elec- tromagnetic interference is the clear im- plication. 57 The haywire electronics equipment is also frequently en- countered in putative abduction cases: I have spoken (independently) to three women who claimed to have been able to disturb or shut off televisions and stereos simply by walking past the devices; one woman even claimed she had switched on her TV simply by pointing at it! But the radioactive disc is especial- ly intriguing. As former FBI agent Ted Gunderson recently explained to my associate, Alexander Constantine, magnetic radioactive discs have long been used by the clandestine services as cancer-inducing \"silent killers,\" i.e., as tools of assassination. Not only that. The disc calls to mind one little-remembered detail of the Hill case: the dozen-or-so circular \"shiny spots,\" each the size of a silver dollar, found on the trunk of her car directly after the abduction. A compass needle reacted wildly when placed near these spots. Could they have marked the loca- tion where an electromagnetic or radioactive device, similar to that found by Niles, was placed on the car? (Such a device might have been held to the spot magnetically, hence the circular impressions.) If so, then the disorient- ing EMR could have helped induce the Hill's \"UFO sighting.\" Screen Memories The question arises: If mind control is a reality, why would its victims speak of aliens? I suggest that a hypno-programmed \"UFO\" cover story effectively solves the most nagging drawback of the ear- ly brainwashing research. I refer to the \"disposal problem,\" i.e., the question of what to do with the victims. During the 1950s, the Company resorted to distressing, but characteristic, tactics: They disposed of their human guinea pigs by incarcerating them in insane asylums, by performing icepick lobotomies, and by ordering \"executive actions.\" 10 A more sophisticated solu- tion had to be found. The scientists researched an elegant answer: Make the victim forget what had happened. \"Amnesia was a big goal,\" confirms Victor Marchetti, who points out its usefulness in dealing with contract agents: \"After you've done it, the agent doesn't even know what he's done ... you send him in, he does the job. When he comes out, you clean his head out.\" 59 The big problem: Despite hypnotically-induced amnesia, there would be memory leaks, snippets of the repressed material would arise spon- taneously, in dreams, as flashbacks, etc. A proposed solution: give the subject a \"screen memory,\" a false story; thus, even if he starts to recall the material, he will recall it incorrectly. Even the conservative hypnosis specialist Martin Orne notes that: \"A S [subject] who is able to develop good posthypnotic amnesia will also respond to suggestions to remember events which did not actually occur. On awakening, he will fail to recall the real events of the trance and will instead recall the suggested events. If anything, this phenomenon is easier to produce than total amnesia, perhaps because it eliminates the subjective feeling of an empty space in memory.\" 60 Not only would the screen memories fill in the uncomfortable blanks in the subjects' recollection, they would pro- tect against revelation. One fear of the MKULTRA scientists was that a hypno- programmed individual used as, say a courier, could be un-programmed by another hypnotist, perhaps working for MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the enemy. Thus, the MKULTRA scientists decided to instill multiple per- sonalities — multiple cover stories, if you will — to confuse any \"unauthor- ized\" hypnotist. 61 One case using this technique centered on an assassin named Luis Castillo, who, after his capture in the Philippines, was extensively de-briefed and studied by experts in the employ of the National Bureau of Investigation, that country's equivalent to our FBI. Castillo was discovered to have had at least four separate personalities hyp- notically instilled; each personality could be triggered by a specific cue. The main hypnotist involved with this case labelled these hypnotic alter-egos \"Zombie states.\" The report on the case stated that \"The Zombie phenomenon referred to here is a somnambulistic behavior displayed by the subject in a conditioned response to a series of words, phrases, and statements, ap- parently unknown to the subject dur- ing his normal waking state.\" U pon Castillo's repatriation to the United States, the FBI claimed that he had fabricated the story. In his book, Operation Mind Control, Walter Bowart makes a con- vincing case against the FBI's claims. Certainly, many aspects of the Castillo affair argue for his sincerity, including his hypnotically-induced insensitivity to pain, 62 his maintenance of the story (or stories) even when severely inebriated, and his apparently programmed suicide attempts. If Castillo told the truth, as I believe he did, then he manifested both hypnotically-induced multiple per- sonality and pseudomemory. The former remains controversial; the lat- ter has been repeatedly replicated in ex- perimental situations. 63 This point is vitally important for students of the abduction phenomenon. We cannot assume the accuracy of ab- duction descriptions given during subsequent hypnotic regression. Moreover, we cannot even assume the accuracy of spontaneously-arising recollections (i.e., abduction memories not elicited through hypnotic regres- sion). Indeed, responsible skeptics have We cannot assume the accuracy of abduction descrip- tions given during subsequent hypnotic regression. Moreover, we cannot even assume the accuracy of spontaneously-arising recollections. argued that hypnotic regression may prove inadvertently harmful, in that it may lock in place a false remembrance. (Note, however, that other psychiatric professionals consider hypnotic re- gression the best technique, however flawed, in unlocking amnesia. 64 For my part, I maintain an ambivalent and cautious attitude toward the use of hyp- nosis in abductee work.) Granted, it is all too easy for the debunkers to cry \"confabulation\" to dismiss hypnotic testimony which does not conform to our preconceptions of the possible; I do not intend to make this same error. Whenever skeptics of- fer the phenomenon of pseudomemory to rationalize abduction claims, they cite experimental situations in which pseudomemory was originally created by a hypnotist. 65 These experiments can not be cited as proof that an individual abductee spontaneously conjured up a fantasy (which just happens to cor- respond to the details of hundreds of similar \"fantasies\".) Rather, labora- tory studies of pseudomemory creation prove my point: Pseudomemory can be induced by previous hypnosis. 66 In other words, an abductee may talk of aliens, when the reality was something else entirely. The otherworldly \"screen memory\" could also prove extremely useful should the \"controller\" wish to induce anti-social behavior. We commonly assume that such behavior cannot be hypnotically incurred. But exceptions to this rule have occasionally found their way into the courtroom; one such case, which led to the incarceration of the hypnotist, was the Palle Hardrup affair. This incident occurred in Denmark in 1951. 67 Palle Hardrup robbed a bank, killing a guard in the process, and later claimed that he had been instructed to do so by the hypnotist Bjorn Nielsen. Nielsen eventually confessed to having engineered the crime as a test of his hypnotic abilities. The most significant aspect of this in- cident concerns the \"pose\" Nielsen adopted to work his malicious designs. During the hypnosis sessions, Nielsen hypnotically suggested that he was Hardrup's \"guardian angel,\" repre- sented by the letter X. Hardrup testified that \"There is another room next door where Nielsen and I go and talk on our own. It is there that my guardian spirit usually comes and talks to me. Nielsen says that X has a task for me.\" One of these tasks was arranging for Hardrup's girlfriend to have sex with the hypnotist. The other tasks, as men- tioned, included robbery and murder. Nielsen convinced his victim that \"X\" wanted the robbery funds to be used for worthwhile political goals. The end, Hardrup was told, justified the means. Thus, we have one possible means of overcoming the proposition that hyp- nosis cannot induce anti-social behavior. If a hypnotist lacks scruples, and has access to a particularly suscep- tible subject, he can induce a misperceived reality. Actions which we would abhor in an everyday context become acceptable in specialized cir- cumstances: A citizen who could never commit murder on a suburban street might, if drafted into an army, kill on the field of battle. In hypnosis, the mind becomes that battlefield. In the words of Dr. John Watkins: \"We behave on the basis of our perceptions. If our perceptions of a situation can be altered so as to cause us to misconstrue it, or to develop a false belief, then our behavior in rela- tion to it will be drastically altered. It is precisely in the area of changing perceptions that the hypnotic modality demonstrates its most powerful effects. Hallucinations, both under hypnosis and posthypnotic, can easily by induced in the suggestible subject. He can be made to ignore painful stimuli, be ap- parently unable to hear loud sounds, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"and \"see\" individuals who are not pre- sent [my italics]. Moreover, attitudes and beliefs can be initiated in him which are quite abnormal and often contrary to those which he previously held.\" 68 Compare the Hardrup scenario to that encountered in the typcial contactee case, in which alien \"guardians\" con- vince their victims/subjects that the en- counter will eventually serve some unspecified \"higher purpose.\" Indeed, in my interviews with abductees who have established a \"long-term\" relation- ship with their visitors, I have found that some of them originally believed themselves in contact with Hardrup-like angelic guardians. Only in recent years was the \"angel\" pose discarded and the true \"alien\" form revealed. Final Thoughts Press and public now regard ab- ductees as tony curiosities; yet science, for the most part, still banishes their tales to the domain of the damned, as Charles Fort defined damnation. So too with claimed victims of mind control. The Voice of Authority tells us that MKULTRA belongs to history; like Hasdrubal and Hitler, it threatened once, but no more. Anyone insisting otherwise must be silenced by glib ra- tionalization or selective inattention. Yet these two topics — UFO abduc- tions and mind control — have more in common than their mutual ostraciza- tion. The data overlap. If we could chart these phenomena on a Venn diagram, we would see a surprisingly large in- tersection between the two circles of in- formation. It is the overlap I seek to address. Once other abduction researchers have been educated in the ways of MKULTRA (and this article is intended as an introductory text) they may note this pattern as well. If so, we may then proceed to write a revisionist history of the phenomenon. Until then, we must, of course, ad- mit that the mind control hypothesis cannot (yet) explain all. For example, any thoughts I might have on the per- sistent reports of alien genetic ex- perimentation would be highly spec- lative. Nor have I addressed the obvious questions of the landing traces and third-party UFO sightings which attend some abduction cases (though I shall offer some comment on these subjects in future efforts). Nevertheless, the MKULTRA hypothesis does cover an impressive amount of territory. As we have seen, our \"controllers\" scenario explains the reports of ab- ductee intracerebral implants (par- ticularly reports involving nosebleeds), unusual scars, \"telepathic\" com- munication (i.e., externally induced in- tracerebral voices) concurrent with or following the abduction encounter, allegations that some abductees hear unusual sound effects (similar to those created by the hemi-synch and cognate devices), haywire electronic devices in abductee homes, personality shifts, manipulation of religious imagery, and missing time. Needless to say, the thesis of clandestine government experimen- tation readily accounts for abductee claims of human beings \"working\" with the aliens, and for the government harassment that plays so prominent a role in certain abductee reports. By no means do I claim to have \"solved\" the abduction riddle. Indeed, whenever I have spoken before au- diences I have always insisted that my listeners examine the entire range of ab- duction speculation, from Klass to Hopkins. I therefore eagerly await criticism from those rankled by this theory, and here express gratitude for the helpful attacks I have already received. I ask only that my critics refrain from in- tellectual laziness. Mere difference in world-view does not constitute a valid argument: God is found in the details. Needless to say, I seek no converts, for I am not myself completely convinced. But — should any ufologists doubt that clandestine operators can induce a series of highly-disorienting \"alien en- counters,\" I ask these skeptics to con- sider one key name: Paul Bennewitz.

Klass argues that ufologists, in conduct- ing hypnotic regression sessions, inadvertently cue their subjects. A close reading of his text reveals that he never proves or claims that such \"cues\" have taken place in any individual in- stance; he simply believes that cueing might have occurred. Had Klass been more willing to deal with abductees directly, he might have found evidence of cause and effect; as it stands, his argument really amounts to no more than a suggestion. For all that, I find his ideas regard- ing the running of \"clean\" hypnotic regression sessions potentially valuable. 67. The story has been told many times.

By Michael D. Swords, Ph.D., Consultant P robably everyone in the UFO community, except raw ama- teurs like myself, realizes that the famed \"original\" UFO scientific-debunker had his own UFO experience, which he dutifully reported to the Air Force. It was on the 12th of May 1949, and it happened while Dr. Menzel was being chauffeured between Holloman Air Force Base and Alamogordo, New Mexico, where he often engaged in solar observations... although since he frequented a Col- orado observatory to \"also\" do this selfsame work, one must, at least, wonder what his real duties there were. In his early debunking book, entitled simply Flying Saucers (1953), Menzel freely discussed his sighting. He says: \"I was in the back seat of an automobile, being driven toward Alamogordo and admiring the full moon as it rose over Sacramento Peak toward the east. A few degrees north of the mo'on, I noticed what seemed to be a bright star, and then a second star appeared not far from the first. Casual- ly, I assumed that they were Castor and Pollux in the constellation Gemini. Then, very suddenly, I realized that Gemini was a winter object; the two stars had to be something else. \"Like most astronomers, I am always hopeful of finding a nova-a star that has exploded and thus become exceptional- ly bright. I rapidly opened the window of the car for a better look. To my sur- prise I could bring neither of these ob- jects into clear focus, although nearby Antares was quite sharp. \"Both hazy disks shone with a slight- ly bluish light. They were, in a sense, 'flying' simply because they were elevated. Suddenly alive to the fact that I was seeing something unusual, I asked the driver to stop. We climbed out of the car just in time to see the saucers literally fade away as mysteriously as they had appeared. I reported the oc- currence in detail to the Air Force\" (pages 3-4). Later, Menzel went on to say that \"a layer of haze, perhaps disturbed and tilted by the moving car (!), probably caused the trick reflections of the moon\" (page 38). The explanation to this naive reader seems a bit contrived, but let us look further. What did Menzel actually report to the Air Force at Holloman vis-a-vis the text descrip- tion above? Much of Menzel's book description accurately follows the UFO report, or at least does little violence to it. A few items seem (conveniently?) left out or downplayed. Menzel estimated that the objects were at least 180 miles away and nine miles from each other. So one wonders at the power of the auto in which he was riding, sufficient to disturb this distant \"layer of haze\" as he suggests in his text write-off. The hazy disks do not \"fade away\" in the official report like good cloud reflec- tions should, but rather \"suddenly disappear\" and \"vanish in a moment.\" Menzel knew that he wasn't dealing with \"Moon-dogs\" or similar optical phenomena, as the objects were below and to the North of the Moon, both on the same side, and not in line. The fur- ther one was marginally brighter than the closer. He says \"there is a bare probability that the patches were clouds, but the behavior was unusual to say the least. The whole phenomen- on is puzzling.\" (my emphasis). Menzel himself observed the event, considered clouds, hazes and optics, and almost entirely rejected them. As an aside, the text reports the color-tinge as bluish ... the Holloman report as \"greenish\"; perhaps to add no fuel to the then-still- puzzling \"green fireball\" mystery? Well, this is hardly enough to ac- cuse Menzel of anything but data- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"manipulation and intellectual dishones- ty, but those are two pretty good character references for a government disinformer. I find another feature of this early book intriguing. Menzel bashes and mocks, mocks and bashes, but all with a level of high-culture intellectualism which leaves you grudgingly admiring the man. His qualities of breadth of knowledge and style make one almost wish that he had better imitators today. At least one could learn something about history, culture and science reading Donald Menzel. But the point of intrigue in the book is this: after all the bashing and mocking, what does he tell you to do? Fill out an elaborate report when you see a UFO and send it to him or Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Pat. \"They will be glad to get such information.\" Really? And you know, if Roswell happened, I wouldn't doubt it a bit. One last thing, just for fun, about Donald Menzel and his texts. In his last book, The UFO Enigma, written with Dr. Ernest Taves (1977), the two doc- tors continue their UFO bashing in the style Menzel made famous. In the book appears a section near and dear to my own heart, \"The Question of Extrater- restrial Life.\" In this chapter Menzel rehashes his thinking published earlier in the Graduate Journal of the Univer- sity of Texas in 1965. It describes what the extraterrestrials will be like. What prompted Menzel to initially write upon this subject I can only guess, but my guess is this: Best Guess In 1964, MenzeFs colleague, paleon- tologist George Gaylord Simpson, authored a scathing critique of the idea of extraterrestrial intelligence in an essay, \"The Non-prevalence of Humanoids.\" Simpson was apparently miffed, if not horrified, at the excessive amount of research funding going into extraterrestrial exploration. He wrote to say that such funding was an especially colossal waste as no in- telligent extraterrestrials existed out there to find. (Simpson viewed the romantic pull of exobiology as the trump card of those pushing space exploration). Menzel's 1965 \"reply\" appears con- ceptually intact (with additions) in the Menzel-Taves book. What I find cur- ious about it is this: Donald Menzel was a very bright man. He knew that all an exobiologist needed to be enthused about was \"life,\" and if possible, \"in- telligent life,\" but as to what form it came in, who cared? Nevertheless, on no (then) good scientific grounds, and opposed by two giants of biology (Simpson and Theodosius Dobzhan- sky), this is what Menzel said: \"What will these superbeings be like? We speculate that they will probably live on land or perhaps be amphibious. They will probably have limbs for locomotion. They will possess a mouth and digestive tract resembling those of some terrestrial organisms. Their eyes and ears will occur in pairs near the mouth, where they served their primi- tive ancestors in the detection and cap- ture of food. They will probably stand upright, though they may be quite dif- ferent from terrestrial primates. We speculate that their brains will be, relative to ours, large. \"We do not believe that the fund- amental molecules, A, T, G, and C will differ much from those we have on Earth, no matter where they are found in the universe\" (page 205). I t may have been that Menzel just wanted to directly refute Simpson, \"authority-to-authority,\" for some reason. Perhaps the two disliked one another, who can say? But a confron- tation without facts, and playing in the other scientist's authoritarian ball park seems a poor strategy, when a com- promise (intelligent non-humanoid life- essentially Carl Sagan's position) would seem sufficient. Why did Menzel feel the urge to state his speculations on \"humanoid ET form\"? Maybe it was just some irrational vision of the nature of things that he had ... maybe he'd ac- tually seen a more concrete vision of the nature of things some years before. But why write about it? Again, who knows? In one view, what was the risk? Any secret project was successfully \"dark\"; Menzel was apparently a total disbeliever in UFOs; what connections could be made? What was there to be gained? A little ego-trip, a secret bit of one-ups-manship, a remarkable \"pre- diction\" if they ever did openly reveal themselves? All of this is mere \"mid- night speculation',' at least until the Roswell investigation and its \"analytical secret project\" come to light. But it is not heroically difficult to see Donald Menzel as an intelligent, highly-placed and militarily-loyal man who knew more than he was willing to say in print, and manipulated what he did know to debunk the extraterrestrial reality of UFOs while supporting the concept of high-tech humanoid extraterrestrials. Returning to the question which is the title for this small speculative piece: Did Donald Menzel behave like he was hiding something? Well ... yes.

Aggen, Jr. I n September of 1959, Donald H. Robey, design specialist for General Dynamics Corporation, presented a theory to account for the phenomenon of slow moving green fireballs. Said fireballs were objects of various sizes which decelerated to speeds of a few hundred miles per hour or less at altitudes of a few miles. They exhibited several unusual character- istics, including erratic flight patterns, metallic appearance at high altitudes, fuzziness at low altitudes, spherical shapes, short periods of visibility and primarily green luminosity. 1 During the great Leonid Meteor Shower of November 12, 1833 (the most remarkable shower on record), peculiar objects moving too slowly to be regular meteors were sighted. In the same year, luminous stationary UFOs were seen emitting radiant streams of light over Niagara Falls. In February of 1913, several hundred fireballs were sighted crossing the sky over New York; in January of 1949, a pilot observed a green fireball entering the atmosphere over New Mexico; on the 2nd of February 1952, a yellow-green fireball was seen in the sky over Trenton, Texas; on September 18, 1954, an enor- mous green fireball passed slowly over Colorado and New Mexico; in March of 1958, a green-tailed fireball was observed over Oakland, California; and in 1972, on August 10th, a huge multicolored fireball was seen by many persons in the western states. 2 ' 3 Green fireballs were sighted so fre- quently over New Mexico between the year 1948 and 1949 that the U.S. Air Force became concerned. In February of 1949, a conference was called at Los Alamos to study the phenomenon. As a result of that study, the USAF's Cam- bridge Research Laboratory initiated Project Twinkle in September of 1949, in an attempt to identify the fireballs. Only one of three proposed cinethe- odolite (tracking camera) stations was subsequently set up, owing to a lack of equipment, personnel and funding. No fireballs were ever photographed or tracked and the project was terminated in the early 1950s. One of the more spectacular fireball sightings occurred on July 19, 1956, in Arkansas City, Kansas. The Kansas State Highway Patrol said a ball of fire traveling east at a high speed had been picked up by radar at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Hutchinson, Kansas. Brian Coyne, the City Editor of the Arkansas City Daily Traveler reported that a brilliant tear-shaped object with \"prongs,\" or streams of light, spraying downward was sighted shortly after midnight. A second object was sighted about 1 a.m. The prongs of bright light were observed first as directed towards the earth and then extending from the sides of the object. The head of the ob- ject was described as being green or bluish-green in color. Several other such objects were also observed. 4 According to Donald H. Robey, some slow fireballs could be \"cometoids,\" objects in a physical state between meteoroids and comets. They are believed to be chunks of matter and/or \"ices\" which have been frozen at ex- tremely low temperatures in the depths of space. They are assumed to be pieces or parts of comets. These frozen chunks of matter are thought to contain sources of thermal and luminous energy and are considered to be unstable. Cometoids may originate when com- ets captured by Jupiter's extremely powerful gravitational field pass too close to Jupiter. The comets would disintegrate into thousands of tiny fragments under the tremendous gravitational stresses. The resultant cometoids would then be thrown nearer the Sun, where Earth would be in a position to attract many of them. Most of the smaller cometoids would sublimate from solar radiation in a decade or less. Larger cometoids would survive longer, perhaps a century or more. Quantitative studies have shown that a solid sphere of frozen ice water enter- ing the atmosphere at a speed of 6.9 miles per second can survive and decelerate to terminal speeds without being completely destroyed. Comet- oids, however, are not composed of pure ice water. The ice matrix of com- etoids is composed of many different elements. Some materials in the matrix will volatilize before others. This pro- cess causes cavities to form. At the same time the ice will melt and refreeze to form a hard, glassy outer shell. 5 C ometoids entering the Earth's atmosphere at a slight angle to the local horizontal, and with a relatively low speed (9 to 10 miles per second), could possibly produce UFO- like phenomena. The cometoids would be subjected to intense ablation from atmospheric friction. Depending on their original configurations, the com- etoids could end up as spheres, discs, cylinders or other shapes. During the period of atmospheric ablation, com- etoids may have super-cold ice struc- tures which fill with hot gases due to the volatilization of various materials. These gases would tend to shoot out through holes in the frozen shell. This could cause the cometoid to wobble or otherwise behave in an erratic manner. Depending on their composition, these hot gases would also cause the com- etoid to glow in one or more colors. Nitrogen, for example, would produce a brilliant green glow. Being so close to Jupiter, Mars is thought to have attracted many com- etoids. The Moon may also have sus- tained many cometoid impacts. Robey has suggested that the object which struck the Earth on June 30, 1908, in the Tunguska River Basin in Siberia, was a cometoid. However, this theory is not supported by other evidence which indicates that the Tunguska Ob- ject was a huge metallic cylinder which changed course twice before crashing MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"to Earth. Interestingly, the \"acorn- shaped\" Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO of December 9, 1965, was also deter- mined to have altered its flight path at least twice before falling to Earth. The Kecksburg object was described as a fireball by ground observers in six states and Canada. Obviously, not all fireballs can be explained as com- etoids, meteors or other natural phenomena! 6 ' 7 Another intriguing theory that may account for cometoids and cometoid- like objects is the hypothesis that where the asteroid belt is now, there once may have been a double planet system. Ac- cording to this theory, one of the planets was destroyed and the other flew free of the destroyed planet's gravitational attraction, becoming the fourth planet from the sun - Mars. The Martian sur- face was cratered and pitted by the tremendous explosion. It pulled two small chunks of the destroyed planet with it, which subsequently became Deimos and Phobos. The flight of Mars from an old orbit into a new one brought in its wake huge clouds of debris, meteor particles and possible cometoids which then literally \"rained\" on the Moon and Earth after being flung free of Mars. This theory would explain why the Moon is more cratered on one side than the other. The great Arizona Meteor crater may also have been formed at this time. Jupiter possibly collected some small satellites, along with Saturn. Every planet would have assumed more ellip- tical orbits than they had before. Mars, Pluto and Mercury, having once been satellites, would then have followed even more elliptical orbits than the others. Originally, their orbits had been almost circular, the result of their for- mation by a swirling cloud of gas that condensed. This theory is highly con- jectural, but it provides some interesting answers to questions about the forma- tion of the solar system. Cometoids, in the end, may ultimate- ly explain a small number of UFO reports. They certainly provide the UFO researcher with additional in- formation to utilize in analyzing uni- que astronomical and atmospheric phenomena. References 1.

REANALYSIS OF PHOTO 19 SUPPORTS WALTERS' STORY By Bruce Maccabee Laser physicist Maccabee is Director of the Maryland-based Fund for UFO Research, Box 277, Mt. Rainer, MD, 20712. In his initial testimony regarding the \"Road Shot\" (photo 19), Ed Wal- ters reported that he had been driving along highway 191-B at about 6:00 p.m. on January 12, 1988 when a brilliant white light suddenly entered the cab of his truck. This caused him to lose some sensation of feeling in his hands and forearms. He said that he momen- tarily lost control of the truck and swerved to the left hand side of the road and then onto the left side shoulder. As this was happening he observed a UFO moving above and ahead of him and, as he managed to stop the truck on the left shoulder, the UFO was hovering several hundred feet ahead over the road. Ed said he had his Polaroid camera with him in the truck. He grabbed the camera and took the picture (photo 19). But then he realized the object was moving and he had the impression that it was going to come back and hit him with the white beam again. He immediately crawled under the truck where he would be completely shielded. Unfortunately, his legs were still protruding as the UFO did, indeed, shine the white beam down on him again. The complete story of the Road Shot (and Ed's other sightings) is told in his book, The Gulf Breeze Sightings (Mor- row, NY, 1990). This is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the historical context of photo 19, the stereo photos of May 1 (which will be refer- red to later) and all of the Gulf Breeze Sightings. Technical analysis is pro- vided in \"A History of the Gulf Breeze Sightings,\" (updated version available from the Fund for UFO Research). For the purposes of this discussion the description given above of how photo 19 happened to be taken is sufficient. Initial Analysis During the initial analysis of photo 19, in the spring of 1988, it was assumed MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Although the illuminated area is highly elongated, there is no physical reason why such an area could not be produced by a UFO (or by a conventional light source). that the bright irregular image within the image of the road was the reflec- tion of light from a non-uniformly radiating source within the glowing bot- tom of the UFO, and that the UFO was actually over the reflection. This seem- ingly reasonable assumption allowed the size of the UFO to be estimated in the following way: First, the location of the reflection was determined by projecting a sighting line across the road in the direction of a \"tree bump\" in the skyline that ap- pears above the image of the UFO. As a person walked along the sighting line from the camera position toward the tree bump he crossed the road and ac- tually walked through the location of the reflection. Since the reflection im- age partially obscured the yellow line in the road, it was assumed that where the sighting line crossed the yellow line was the approximate location of the reflection, and hence the approximate location of the UFO. Measurements made on the site yielded a distance of about 185 feet from the camera to where the sighting line crossed the yellow line. When this distance was combined with the size of the UFO im- age on the film the size of the actual UFO could be calculated. It was found to be about 7.5 feet across the bottom bright area, about nine feet high and about 12 feet across the mid-section. The calculation of the UFO size is the extent of the analysis that has been published to this date. However, in an unpublished calculation done during the summer of 1988,1 used the Reflection Image to estimate the size of the il- luminated area on the road. A simplified calculation showed that it had to be quite long in the dimension along the line of sight. In fact, I estimated it to be about 80 feet long, if its center were 185 feet from the camera. Although this was a surprise to me, I simply attributed this to light coming out from the bottom of the UFO in a non-circular pattern at very flat angles (i.e., nearly horizontal). This seemed odd, but it certainly didn't violate physics. Recently, Rex and Carol Salisberry, in re-evaluating the Walters' sightings, carried out an independent analysis of the Reflection Image in photo 19. Be- ing unaware of my 1988 calculation of the elliptical spot on the road, they pro- ceeded from another assumption. They assumed, for unstated reasons, that light could only come downward from the UFO in a direction roughly parallel to the (nearly) vertical axis of the UFO. Combining this assumption with my estimate of the bottom diameter (7.5 feet) they concluded that, if the UFO were real, then it would illuminate a spot on the road that would be only slightly larger than the bottom of the UFO itself. That is, they claimed that the illuminated spot on the road would have been nearly circular and only about 7.5 to eight feet in diameter. They then used simple photogram- metric and trigonometric calculations to predict what the size of the Reflec- tion Image should be under their assumptions. They predicted that the Reflection Image should appear as a very thin line in photo 19. Since it is, in fact, a very \"fat\" line (measured ver- tically), it disagrees with their predic- tion. Hence, they claimed that the Reflection Image could not have been caused by an actual reflection in the road, since to do so would be a \"vir- tual physical impossibility\" (Salisberry, \"Interim Report on the Reopening of the Walters' UFO Case,\" September 23, 1990). The discovery of this \"physical impossibility\" led them to further con- clude that the Reflection Image must have been faked (by double exposure), with the logical consequence that the whole photo, the story, etc. were all faked. It is of great importance to note that their result follows directly (after some simple math) from their assumption that light from the UFO could only travel downwards (roughly) parallel to the axis. If they had allowed for the possibility that light could travel out- ward from the bottom of the UFO at very fiat angles, then they would have seen that the spot on the road could be much larger than the bottom of the UFO. This is the result I obtained in the summer of 1988. Reanalysis My reanalysis of photo 19 is based on the assumption that the Reflection Image really was caused by light reflected from the road. Starting from this assumption, I have estimated the nearest and farthest points of the re- flection. The distances from the camera to these points were estimated by com- bining on-site measurements on the photographs. By measurement, it was found that the sighting line from the camera toward the tree bump crosses the near edge of the road at a distance of about 90 feet from the camera, and the far edge of the road about 490 feet from the camera. The illuminated spot on the road lies between these two distances. Using photogrammetric techniques in- volving angles that are determined by measurements on the photographs, I estimated that the closest point of the illuminated area to the camera (the lowest point of the Reflection Image) was about 180 feet away, and the far- thest point was about 305 feet away. (These distances could easily be off by 10 feet either way because of the low precision in measuring the actual boun- dary positions of the images.) Similar- ly, the width of the illuminated area was about eight feet. Thus the spot on the road was ap- proximately a thin ellipse with the long axis running along the sighting line to the UFO. (These calculations did not take into account the slight downward slope to the road from the centerline toward the edge. To take this into ac- count would require a much more com- plicated analysis and a very accurate survey of the road. If the downward slop were to be taken into account it MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"FIGURE 1 RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ROAD SHOT SCENE NOT TO SCALE -CAMERA DISTANCES IN FEET TOP VIEW ILLUMINATED AREA 90 180 305 490 would likely decrease by a small amount the calculated length of the il- luminated area.) Although the illuminated area is highly elongated, there is no physical reason why such an area could not be produced by a UFO (or by a conven- tional light source). Thus this analysis shows that the Reflection Image is not a \"virtual physical impossibility\" and it cannot be used as proof that photo 19 is hoaxed. However, the analysis does raise the question of how the highly elongated illuminated area might have been produced. One way would be for the UFO to be over the far end of the reflection, for example, and emanating a very ellip- tical (in cross-section) beam in the direction of Ed's truck, but pointed downward so that it hit the road. Alter- natively, the UFO might be over the center of the illuminated area, directing light downwards and both toward and away from the truck. Yet a third possibility is that the UFO is farther away from the truck than the illum- inated area and is directing a beam downwards and toward the truck. It is this last possibility which I find most interesting. It is important to realize that a previous assumption can be arbitrari- ly rejected. Previously, I and others had assumed that the UFO was actually over the illuminated spot on the road. With this assumption it was possible to calculate the size of the UFO based on the image size and on the measured distance to the reflection (assumed to be rather compact and centered about 185 feet away). Thus the assumption was necessary for the previous analysis. However, it was not justifiable since the distance to an object cannot (generally) be estimated from a single photograph. The distance to an object can be calculated from a stereo pair of photo- graphs, however, and Ed obtained just such a pair on May 1, 1988. The details of this sighting are in Ed's book. The information which is important here is that, using a stereo camera with a two foot baseline, Ed photographed two UFOs, the larger of which looks like the UFO in the Road Shot (see Ed's book for further details). These stereo photos also have images of lights which were at a known large distance. The im- ages of the distant lights allowed the cameras to be calibrated for parallax. After the calibration had been done it was found that the UFO was about 475 feet away (over water!) and nearly 15 feet in diameter across the bottom. Thus its width was nearly twice the value which I had originally estimated for the Road Shot UFO (about 7.5 feet). Assume, now, that the size of the Road Shot UFO was the same as the size of the large May 1 UFO. Since the image size corresponds to a bottom diameter of 7.5 feet at 185 foot distance, then it also corresponds to a diameter of 15 feet at about 370 feet. If the UFO were actually 370 feet from the camera (but still over the road; the sighting line crossed the far side of the road at 490 feet), then the UFO would have been 65 feet from the far- thest point of the reflection (at 305 feet from the camera). Hence the only way the light could get from the UFO to the illuminated spot on the road would be if the UFO projected a beam of light 65 feet toward the truck, but downward at a slight angle so that the beam hit the road. The color of the Reflection Image suggests that this beam of light MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"was white or pale yellow. Light Source A reconstruction of the Road Shot scene, with the illuminated spot be- tween the camera and the UFO, is presented in Figure 1. This reconstruc- tion can explain a puzzling fact about the Reflection Image: its high level of brightness. Under the previous assump- tion that the UFO was directly over the reflection, I carried out tests with a powerful, 100,000 candlepower spotlight shining directly down onto the road. This reflection of the beam on the road made film images that were much, much less bright than the Reflection Image. Hence I had to assume that there was an extremely intense (much, much more than 100,000 candlepower) source of light within the UFO. T his new reconstruction can ex- plain the brightness of the Reflection Image quite easily without resort to extremely intense light sources within the UFO. It is well known that virtually any surface, even a rough black surface like a road, can give a strong reflection in the forward direction when illuminated by light at a grazing angle. This is the phenomenon of forward gloss (a rough, diffuse reflector becomes nearly a specular reflector at grazing incidence). This particular case, with the beam from the UFO hitting the road at a flat angle (several degrees) and the camera viewing the illuminated area at a flat angle (about a degree), is virtually \"op- timized\" for the forward gloss effect. Experiments with a spotlight have con- firmed this effect at the site of the Road Shot. Hence it is reasonable to conclude that the Reflection Image is a result of a moderately intense beam of light, like that from a powerful flashlight, pro- jected downward at a slight angle from the UFO, incident at nearly a grazing angle on the road and reflected in the direction of the truck. Although the photograph itself pro- vides no information which would allow us to choose which is the actual situation (e.g., UFO over the center of the reflection, UFO at the far end of This new reconstruction can explain the brightness of the Reflection Image quite easily without resort to extremely intense light sources within the UFO. the reflection, UFO beyond the reflec- tion, etc.), the context of the situation does provide enough supplementary in- formation to suggest a choice. Ed described being hit by a white light before he ran off the road. He said that after he took the Road Shot he climbed under the truck because he thought the UFO was going to zap him again with the white light. (He says that the UFO did just that while he was crawling under the truck.) What might have caused him to think that the UFO was going to direct the white light at him again? Could it be that the white light was contained within a beam from the UFO and that Ed realized that the beam was hitting the road just ahead of him after he took photo 19? Perhaps the white spot on the road, made by the beam, started moving slowly toward the truck just after Ed took the picture. Under these circumstances, he might well have concluded that the object was going to try to hit him again with the beam. Although there is no direct photographic evidence that the Reflec- tion Image was made by a white beam on the road, the preceding discussion shows that the existence of such a beam would be consistent with Ed's story and with the brightness of the Reflection Image. The existence of a beam also allows the UFO to be further from the truck than the reflection, and this, in turn, means that the UFO in the Road Shot could have been the same size as was the \"large size Type 1 UFO\" in the May 1 stereo photos. Conclusion The preceding analysis shows that the shape of the Reflection Image is not a \"physical impossibility\" and hence does nor prove the Road Shot is a hoax as claimed by Rex and Carol Salisberry. A reconstruction of the Road Shot scene based on this reanalysis supports Ed's story by demonstrating that the Reflection Image may actually have been caused by the white light, which Ed described, in the form of a beam projected from the UFO toward the truck. Note: Photo 14 also has an Reflec- tion Image underneath the image of the UFO. The Reflection Image is quite non-circular and can be explained in a manner similar to the explanation of the Reflection Image in photo 19. The Gulf Breeze, FL UFO Encounters By Donald M.

Hamilton IE As a State Section Director in the Antelope Valley, California area for the past three years, Hamilton has been investigating reports of anomalous aerial objects. He is now a MUFON Field Investigator in Glendale. The Antelope Valley of California is the site of the fastest growing communi- ty of the Golden State. The reason for the burgeoning of the population is only partly due to the expansion of the Aerospace industry in the windy town of Palmdale. Lower home prices and cleaner air have also attracted many homebuyers who are willing to put up with the longer commute. Antelope Valley is also home of Air Force Plant 42, Northrop, Lockheed, McDonnel-Douglas and Rockwell plants, as well as occupying a position south of Edwards Air Force Base near the little town of Rosamond and north of Palmdale and Lancaster. Strange aircraft are no strangers to this part of the desert. Overflights of the SR-71 Blackbird (no longer flying), the Bl-B bomber, the Stealth B2, and the Stealth fighter F-117A have been observed by residents of the valley. But residents have been disturbed by other, more bizarre aeroforms that demon- strate performance characteristics not common to advanced military aircraft. I have been investigating sightings in the Antelope Valley for three years now, but sightings in the area have only been brought to national attention recently by an article in Aviation Week and Space Technology (1). The article men- tions several sightings of triangular- shaped aeroforms. These wing-shaped aircraft are of unknown origin. A dif- ferent aircraft which produces a thunderous roar has also been spotted. The Air Force would not confirm or deny that the aircraft were new concept warplanes. The article also alludes to \"tech- nologies that outstrip those now employed by engineers charged with developing more traditional, current- generation aircraft,\" adding \"there is substantial evidence that another family of craft exists that relies on exotic pro- pulsion and aerodynamic schemes not fully understood at this time.\" I phoned the writer of the article, Bill Scott, to discuss the sightings he re- ported and to compare them with ones I have investigated and recorded in my files. Bill is senior engineering editor for Aviation Week, has a background as a flight test engineer and is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. Scott admitted that the \"exotic\" pro- pulsion he made reference to in the ar- ticle may be an anti-gravity propulsion unit. He had heard of these crafts' strange ability to move at extremely low speeds (15-25 mph) and then accelerate rapidly to supersonic velocities. He had also visited Rachel, Nevada, in the hopes of viewing the glowing disks seen by several witnesses over the Groom Mountains, adjacent to the sprawling Nevada Test Site. Boomerang On October 26, 1988 while living in the Antelope Valley, my neighbors Ken and Katy saw a large boomerang- shaped craft between 8:35 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. that was estimated to be 600+ feet in span, and was apparent- ly traveling only about 20-30 mph. A second and identical large object joined behind the first one. The trailing boom- erang was followed by approximate- ly 15-20 disk-shaped objects in forma- tion. The last one in formation had a light that alternately flashed yellow and red. Two additional witnesses saw the boomerangs pass over the valley from a side-view to the east. These boom- erangs were also sighted in the town of Fresno later that same evening. I had heard the low-pitched droning of one of the objects as it had passed along my rear property line. My atten- tion was distracted by a pick-up truck that was pacing the objects and shin- ing a spotlight in their direction. The objects rose in altitude to clear the Tehachapi Mountains to the north, fly- ing directly over a secret Northrop underground installation that is housed in the saddle of the mountains. I had been up to the guard gate of the installa- tion earlier that year, investigating mysterious lights seen around that area. We have now recorded the presence of strange glowing orbs that seem to emanate from that facility. These orbs seem to cast a brilliant gold lumines- cence without the light reflecting off the surrounding mountain terrain! The orbs also make the same gravity-defying manuevers as other UFOs. In June of 1989, a security guard on post at Air Force Plant 42 observed a silvery object in the vicinity of a Bl-B doing touch-and-goes on the landing strip. He had seen the object move in- to a stationary position over the landing field. He also reported seeing three metallic spheres flying over the Palmdale control tower. Control tower personnel acknowledged his report. These spheres are reported to be the same as the glowing orbs seen at night. On November 18, 1989 a witness observed a large boomerang-shaped object described as a black mass mov- ing silently over Ave. J-4 and Sierra Highway in downtown Lancaster, at ap- proximately 7:42 p.m. Its size was estimated to be 600-900 feet in span. The black mass had lights of low in- tensity, about the brilliance of stars, outlining its airframe. Off the left tip of the giant object was a silvery metallic disk about 30-40 feet in diameter which MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"shone by reflected ground light. The same witness saw another disk on the night of May 21, 1990, traveling in a SW-NE trajectory, have a near- collision with a KC-135 from Palmdale Airport as the plane circled over Ave. J-4 in Lancaster. The plane was ob- served to rock its wings as if the pilot were trying to avoid collision or was just startled by such a near pass of the fast-moving disk. Another Lancaster resident reported seeing three triangles with red lights around their perimeters passing on a westward course between Edwards AFB and the Tehachapis around the night of October 3, 1990. This witness was watching the \"Hard Copy\" televi- sion report on the Belgium sightings on the night of October 25th, when she glanced out the window to see another triangle moving around north of Lan- caster for about ten minutes. This one had bright white lights at the corners of the triangle and manuevered slowly. Artificial Gravity According to the hypothesis of artificial-gravity field (AGF) propul- sion, the mass of the craft is rendered virtually inertialess with respect to planetary gravity fields. An AGF im- parts uniform and simultaneous ac- celeration to all particles of mass com- posing the craft and crew. The AGF is also said to create an envelope from the planetary atmosphere which is bound to the craft and moves with the craft. This has the effect of reducing shock waves and eliminating sonic booms within the earth's atmosphere. Accord- ing to \"black world\" engineers I have talked to in confidence concerning these aeroforms, we have been developing the technology of field propulsion. Such technology is being researched and developed in classified subterranean facilities. Is the existence of this technology being gradually leaked to aviation editors and UFO investigators? Only time will tell. One strange story I have heard is that Northrop and General Electric have constructed an Alien Replicated Vehi- Continued on page 21 Whether spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin or advanced military prototypes, of this there is no doubt: strange aircraft continue to fly over the California deserts. \"3 V SMALL FLYING TRIANGLE BIG BOOMERANG ARV SAUCER PLANFORMS OF AEROSPACE CRAFT SEEN OVER ANTELOPE VALLEY, CALIFORNIA MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"News Vi 'Views ... POII, Fuller out Astronaut Poll In January 1990, MUFON courage- ously polled all present and former U.S. Astronauts asking whether they would endorse a call for a Congressional in- vestigation into official handling of the UFO phenomenon. On October 6, 1989, Dr. Brian O'Leary, former Astronaut (selected by NASA July 26, 1967) issued a press release calling for such an investigation. No present Astronaut responded to the poll, whereas 11 former Astronauts did. The 11 respondents all said no. One of the respondents didn't have the courage to sign his name, though it would not have been made public if he so desired. It seems present Astronauts must be under some restraints to pre- vent them from responding. To those who responded, MUFON thanks and respects their right to their opinions. However, this writer does not respect comments disparaging of Dr. O'Leary and his credentials. Astronaut Stuart A. Roosa, for example, said \"O'Leary was not an astronaut because he didn't fly 50 miles above Earth.\" Astronaut Eugene A. Cernan said \"O'Leary takes advantage of a short- lived association.\" Astronaut Walter M. Schirra said \"O'Leary is a phony, hav- ing resigned from a training group.\" Astronaut Deke Slayton said \"his credentials are zero.\" When O'Leary was designated an Astronaut by NASA it was not then necessary to have flown any missions, 50 miles above Earth or otherwise. NASA has the right to set out new criteria to become an Astronaut. It is repulsive to the law to make new criteria operate retroactively. Only totalitarian nations, not subject to the balancing mechanisms of the law, are free to revise history to meet changing circumstances. Dr. Brian O'Leary was an Astronaut, has the right to say so, and is due an apology from those named above. NASA says there are now 91 current and 56 former Astronauts. — Robert H. Bletchman Director of Public Relations MUFON THE NEW YORK TIMES OBITUARIES FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9. 1990 John Fuller, 76, Writer on the Unexplained, Dies By EDWIN McDOWELL John Fuller, a playwright, documen- tary film producer and author of many books about the unexplained, died Wednesday at the Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital. He was 76 years old and lived in Weston, Conn. His wife, Elizabeth, said he died of lung cancer. For all his versatility, Mr. Fuller was best known for books about unidenti- fied flying objects, the occult and near- disasters. \"The Ghost of Flight 401,\" published in 1976, was made into a television movie starring Ernest Borg- nine. \"The Interrrupted Journey\" (1966), about a couple in Portsmouth, N.H., who under hypnosis relate details of having been taken aboard a space ship and interviewed by its humanoid occupants, became a television movie starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Mr. Fuller's last book, \"The Pack\" (1989), about rats taking over after a nuclear meltdown, is his only novel. John Grant Fuller was born in Phila- delphia on Nov. 30,1913, and graduated from Lafayette College in 1936. For the next 25 years he worked in radio and television and was at various times a writer, director or producer of such shows as \"20th Century,\" \"Du Pont Show of the Week,\" \"The Garry Moore Show,\" \"Candid Camera\" and \"The Great American Dream Machine.\" Mr. Fuller wrote two Broadway plays: \"The Pink Elephant\" (1953), a two-act comedy with Steve Allen in the role of a rebellious ghost writer for a politician, and \"Love Me Little\" (1958), a comedy adapted by Mr. Fuller from a novel by Amanda Vail, the pen name of Warren Miller. Mr. Fuller wrote a column for The Saturday Review of Literature from 1957 to 1967, during which time he wrote several books, including \"Inci- dent At Exeter\" (1966), an account of stories told by people in Exeter, N.H., about flying saucers. That experience started Mr. Fuller on a long line of books on similar or related subjects: \"Arigo: The Surgeon With the Rusty Knife\" (1974), \"The Airman Who Would Not Die\" (1979) (1968), \"We Almost Lost Detroit\" (1975) and \"The Poison That Fell From the Sky\" (1978), about the after- effects of a chemical plant explosion in 1976 near the Italian town of Seveso. Mr. Fuller was sometimes criticized by reviewers for not using footnotes in nis books and for what they judged was the implausibility of his topics. But as Jeff Greenfield wrote in The New York Times Book Review in reviewing \"The Poison That Fell From the Sky,\" Mr. Fuller \"keeps raising the most unset- tling of questions.\" Moreover, even be- fore passage of the Freedom of Infor- mation Act, he had a facility for some- how obtaining Government documents, which he incorporated in some of his books. In addition to his wife, Mr. Fuller is survived by their son, Christopher, also of Weston; three sons from a previous marriage, John G., of Toronto; Geof- frey, of New Haven, and Judd, of New York, and a sister, Carol Chambers.

According to the story, Pearson had been granted access to Air Force UFO files which showed that the military had checked each case with the utmost care. • Dozens of excited residents at Pasco, Washington, reported that they watched a shiny \"cigar-shaped\" object in the vicinity of the Hanford atomic plant near sundown on the 21st. Atomic and military authorities maintained they had \"no reports\" of anything irregular. Perry Torbergson, managing editor of the Columbia Basin News, and Jack Anderson, his city editor, were among those who said they watched the craft for eight minutes. \"It was shaped like a cigar and glistened brightly,\" Tor- bergson said. \"Anderson, myself and everybody on Pasco's downtown streets watched it for a full eight minutes before it disappeared in its southwest- erly course.\" Anderson added: \"Nearly everyone I talked to seemed to agree that it stopped and hung in the air.\" • 1955 About 6 p.m. on the fifth, Reverend Kenneth R. Hoffman and his wife were driving toward Cleve- land, Ohio Airport when they sighted bright lights in the sky. As the minister stopped the car, he saw that the cluster of lights was attached to a large object. \"It was like two saucers,\" Reverend Hoffman said. \"The upper-most was inverted and resting on the edges of the lower one. An intense white light shone from eight, large rectangular windows visible on the perimeter of the craft, casting a beam of light downward at about a 45-degree angle from each win- dow. The light rays were so bright that we could see the air dust in them,\" Hoffman said. The body of the vehicle appeared to be metallic, and was a pearly or gray aluminum color. Since the apparent diameter of the craft was wider than the roadway, Hoffman estimated the actual size must have been 100 feet wide, distance about a half mile away and about 500 feet above the highway. After hovering for about ten minutes, the disc moved westward and disappeared. Neither of the witnesses heard any sound from the craft. • A UFO in the form of a globe of white light returned recognition signals with a Piper airplane over Desert Hot Springs, California, about 6 p.m. on the 14th. Gene Miller, pilot of the plane and manager of the Banning Municipal air- port, and his passenger, Dr. Leslie Ward of Redlands, sighted the object while returning from a chartered flight to Phoenix, Arizona. Miller said he first thought the object was an airliner and blinked his lights twice as a recognition signal. The fiery globe flip- ped its light out twice in answer. \"When the globe blinked out, there was total darkness,\" Miller said. \"There were no position lights or red and green lights to indicate an aircraft.\" Miller said the strange object con- tinued traveling toward his plane. About a mile away from the object, Miller switched his landing lights three times and received a similar return signal. \"At that moment the object really surprised us,\" Miller said. \"It suddenly backed up in mid-air, clear over the hills and went toward the top of Mount San Gorgonio, disappearing from sight.\" The airport manager said that his sighting took place four days before Desert Hot Spring residents reported that a mystery object blazed across the sky on the 18th and burned on the slopes of Mount San Gorgonio. \"I don't know whether there is any connection,\" said Miller, \"but it's certainly weird.\" • 1960 Mr. and Mrs. R.D. Coff- man were driving to a lake on their farm near Henderson, Kentucky, about 1:30 p.m. on the 17th, when they spot- ted a mysterious object soaring high in the sky over the Baskett Valley area. Its behavior called for closer inspection, so Mrs. Coffman used the binoculars she was carrying to bring it closer. The strange object was flying noiselessly, was orange with a brown and black base. There were no markings. As the Coffmans watched, the strange object periodically gave off a strange substance that would blossom with the wind and spread over a wide area. As the substance settled to the ground they found it to be similar to a spider web that would disintegrate rapidly. The Coffmans watched the object for several minutes, then it moved away at a high rate of speed. • 1965 On the ninth, the night of the great NE blackout, numerous UFOs were sighted over New \\brk state. After landing his single engine plane at Han- cock Airport at Syracuse, New York, during the blackout, Deputy City Avia- tion Commissioner Robert Walsh said that \"a strange thing happened. I was sitting on the ground near the runway with others when we saw a sudden ball of fire south of us. It appeared to be about 100 feet in the air and 50 feet in diameter.\" About ten minutes later, Walsh said, the group saw another ball of fire answering the same description. Weldon Ross, a part-time flight in- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"structor with the Syracuse Flying School and his student, James Brook- ings, reported seeing a \"ball of orange- reddish fire which flared up bigger than a house fire.\" Ross said he and Brook- ings were moving toward Hancock Air- port and were over Three Rivers \"when the lights went out. We were over the high line (high voltage electric power line) when we saw the fire flash. It looked like a barn fire, a barn full of hay, and lasted for perhaps 10 seconds.\" Ross pinpointed the spot as three or four miles east of Cicero, about where the \"high line crosses the South Bay Road.\" It gradually dwindled. A Camillus housewife and three of her children reported they saw a \"huge, dome-shaped\" fireball in the sky just before the lights went out. Mrs. Dewey Boshers said a mushroom-type ball of light appeared in the southeastern sky. The light ascended, then began to move forward. As it did so, the city lights dimmed. Then the fireball moved backward and disappeared in a flash, simultaneous with the loss of electric light. Another Camillus woman, Mrs. Everett B. Jones, said she saw a huge ball of fire hovering over Camillus Plaza shortly after the lights went out. Actor Stuart Whitman vowed that during the blackout two UFOs pulled up outside his hotel window in New York city and the occupants com- municated with him and admitted they were responsible for the blackout. Whitman was a serious-minded actor, who swore he was dead sober just before dawn when the occupants com- municated with him. \"... They gave off a strange luminescent light. So I couldn't see if there were portholes or who was in them. Then I heard them speaking to me as if they were on a loud speaker. They spoke to me in English. I don't know why they picked me as a contact. But I'll swear on a Bible that I saw them out there and that they talked to me.\" • Late in the evening of the 29th, young Kevin Davis and Gary Jardine observed a UFO with a blinking red dome near Springhill, Nova Scotia, Canada. The craft had portholes and emitted an exhaust and humming sound. As the young men watched, a long bar-like object emerged through the largest porthole, re-entered the vehi- cle, then emerged a second time. Then \"something like smoke\" came from the large craft \"and sparks flew upward.\" The snow in the area was blown around and some of the bushes were flattened as the object ascended out of sight. • Seaman Ian Kinsey, of Her Majes- ty's Coastal Service, was on his 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. watch on the 30th at the Corn- wallis station, located about 125 miles SW of Springhill, Nova Scotia. About 3 a.m., he spotted a yellow, oval-shaped object sitting on the nearby beach. The craft was \"lit up\" but not glaring. After watching the vehicle for about five minutes, a sliding door opened on the side of the craft, emitting a white light. Then a small, cigarette-shaped object entered the larger vehicle through the door. The large craft ascended, \"slowly cruised over the mountains and was gone.\" Kinsey said that as the vehicle took off, it pushed \"rocks, logs and other material\" away from the center of the beach. • 1975 The North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) admit- ted it tracked a UFO on radar on the llth and then scrambled two American F-106 fighter jets to intercept the mysterious object. Although the jet fighters failed to make contact with it, several other mysterious objects were spotted from the ground the same mor- ning hovering in the skies over Ontario, Canada. But, only one UFO was pick- ed up on radar. Among the witnesses were seven police officers, military per- sonnel from the NORAD radar base at Falconbridge, Ontario, and civilian residents in the area. Capt. Gordon Hilchie, director of public affairs for the 22nd NORAD Region Control Center at North Bay, Ontario, Canadian NORAD head- quarters, said: \"This is the first time that NORAD has been on the record as saying, 'Yes, we saw this so-called UFO at the same time people outside were saying they saw it, too'. \" Lt. Col. Brian Wooding, director of the 22nd NORAD Region Control Center said: \"We get quite a few UFO reports, but to my knowledge this is about the only one we've actually seen on radar, and the only time we've gone to the point of scrambling interceptors. The jets were scrambled because the indications were there was something very evident to a large number of people, and because we did manage to get some sort of radar sighting.\" Del Kindschi, a spokesman for NORAD headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado said that the jets were scrambled from Selfridge Air Force Base near Detroit, Michigan, at 10:45 a.m. He said the UFO was tracked intermittently on radar for six hours. Asked if it is normal procedure to scramble jets after UFOs, Col. Wooding replied: \"Only if we have something that indicates a chance of making a possible interception.\" Capt. Hilchie said that the UFO tracked on radar was first spotted 25 to 30 miles south of the radar site. He said it zoomed upward from 26,000 feet to 45,000 feet, \"stopped awhile, and then moved up very quickly to 72,000 feet.\" First reports of the eerie-looking lights in the sky came at 3 a.m. from residents of Sudbury, Ontario, 15 miles SW of the Falconbridge radar station. Excited callers reported to police that the brilliant lights, hovering low in the sky, suddenly shot straight upward at tremendous speed. Regional Police In- spector Frank Singer said two of his of- ficers sighted four objects, three sta- tionary and one moving in a jerky, cir- cular motion. At Falconbridge, the commanding officer, Maj. Robert Oliver, said that he and five others at the base saw three mysterious objects in the sky. \"I got a call from my opera- tions officer about 6 a.m. and we went up the hill, and lo and behold, there were three bright yellow objects. We viewed these objects through binoculars and weren't able to make any identifica- tion at all.\" Maj. Oliver declined to discuss the reports of sightings he had received from local people and citizens of the area. \"I feel it is important that we receive reports on UFOs, and I don't Continued on page 22 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 271 November 1990"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"LETTERS ... Gulf Breeze Six; Circles Dear Editor: Regarding \"Gulf Breeze Capture\" in MUFON UFO Journal Number 267, July 1990: Carol and Rex Salisberry met with four of the six former Army members in Gulf Breeze on Saturday, August 11, 1990 for almost two hours. The four iterated what they had said publicly to the media at the time of their return to Gulf Breeze a few days earlier. They apparently have chosen Gulf Breeze as a convenient central location at which to regroup while planning for their future. The six had been studying the Bible, particularly Revelations, as a loose knit group and had become quite religious. They claim to have not been members of any religious group or cult. Because of what were possibly para-normal events, they all suddenly got the urge at the same time to get out of Germany, which they did. They relate that similar events have continued to occur in Ger- many since their departure. They came to the Gulf Breeze area to visit friends and to sort out what they were going to do, i.e., turn themselves in to the Army, hide out in the hills, etc. It is interesting that they were arrested by the local police for a faulty tail light on which they had just spent $30 to have fixed. Reports in the local media have indicated that they may have come to Gulf Breeze to meet with Ed Walters, which they firmly deny. They claim to have had slight knowledge of Walters until they heard his comments con- cerning them on local TV. They claim to have read one of Bill Cooper's reports and found in it some bearing on what they had been studying in the Bi- ble. Because of this, they had hoped to meet with Cooper at some point to discuss this with him. They relate that the experience which triggered their compulsion to leave Ger- many had nothing to do with their jobs or the U.S. Army. They claim to have had good attitudes toward their work in the Army and repeated several times that they had to leave Germany and not the Army. They claim to know nothing of a so-called \"End of the World\" group. They also claim to know nothing of the identity or location of any Anti- christ or anything about a scheduled \"Rapture.\" They credit a mis- interpretation by the sister of one of the group as the source of these errors in reporting by the media. They hope to jointly issue a public statement soon to clarify why they left Germany and other matters. In summa- tion, the media and others may have ex- aggerated a simple AWOL case out of proportion with the facts, which is not uncommon, particularly in Ufology. — Rex C. Salisberry Navarre Beach, FL Dear Editor: There are still doubtless people who believe that the earth is flat, but one would not expect to find the MUFON UFO Journal lending its correspond- ence columns to such pleas. Similarly, I am surprised to find Paul Fuller's let- ter (August 1990) advocating Dr. Meaden's now totally discredited Plasma Vortex theory as the agency behind the Crop Circle phenomenon. The summer of 1990 saw a complete- ly new phase in the developing com- plexity of the Crop Circles with the ad- vent of highly articulate \"pictograms\" in the English grainfields. Enclosed is a photograph of one such formation found near Alton Barnes on July 12. Meaden's theory fails entirely to explain the precise geometry, the increasing complexity, the rapidly increasing numbers, the extraordinary variety of new and definite shapes (of an ap- parently symbolic nature), and a whole host of other aspects of the Circles phenomenon. My discovery in June that a giant triple-ringed Circle near Devizes had \"grown\" an additional fourth outer ring of 1000 ft. in circumference, one week after the original formation appeared, seems to indicate that the Circles are produced by energy fields which re- main in situ, and can be reactivated, rather than by any singular meteorolog- ical event as Dr. Meaden would have us believe. As far as the vast majority of Circles' researchers are concerned, his Plasma Vortex theory is complete- ly dead and buried. It is all very well for Fuller to can- vas 32 meteorologists' opinions regard- ing the Circles when most of these peo- ple are unaware of the facts and have never visited a crop circle. I have met many serious people who hold equal- ly untenable ideas about the Circles with equal conviction; their common denominator has almost always been that none had ever visited or inspected a Circle formation for themselves. Even without such first hand experience, I have little doubt that those learned meteorological gentlemen would soon revise their views were they just to look at the photographs of the 1990 pic- tograms, which can be seen in two new books on the Circles, The Crop Circle Enigma (Gateway Books), and The UFO Report 1991 (Sidgwick and Jackson). Readers may remember that Paul Fuller and Jenny Randies recently (June 1990) made the extraordinary claim that \"UFO research in its own right is now dead and has become part of meteorology.\" The most appropriate re- joinder to such a crass pronouncement is perhaps the German saying: \"Gegen die dummheit Hampfen die Goffer vergebens,\" which means roughly that even the Gods struggle in vain against stupidity. — George Wingfield Somerset, UK Have a Viewpoint To Express?

Webb December 1990 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Brilliant Mars is well up in the east at dusk and is moving westward in Taurus below the Pleiades. It still rivals Jupiter in brightness early in the month but then begins to dim somewhat as the Earth pulls away from our neighbor. Still shining at -1.6 magnitude in mid-December, the red world makes a nice telescopic target. Look for Mars 3° below the full moon on the 1st and 2° below the gibbous Moon on the 28th. Jupiter (-2.4), in Cancer, rises in the ENE about 8 PM in midmonth. The giant is brightening toward an opposition next month. Saturn (0.6), in Sagittarius, lies very low in the SW at dusk, setting about 6:30 in mid-December. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars sets in the NW as twilight begins. Jupiter is high in the WSW at dawn. Meteor Shower: The morning of the 14th sees the Geminid meteors at their climax, radiating from near Gemini's star Castor at a rate of about one meteor per minute. The Geminids are relatively slow, bright, white streaks with short paths. There is no Moon to interfere this year. Moon Phases: Full moon — December 2 Last quarter — December 8 New moon — December 16 First quarter — December 24 Full moon — December 31 3 o Two full moons in one month and two perigees (Moon closest Earth) in a single month. Last time this occurred was May 1988; next time August 1993. December 2 full moon perigee is nearest Moon of 1990 and closest in many years. The Stars: In midevening, while the star patterns of summer and autumn advance past the meridian into the western sky, the bright luminaries of the winter season ascend higher in the east. Look for the Winter Circle in the SE — Sirius, Procyon, the Twin Stars Pollux and Castor, Capella, Aldebaran and Rigel. Jupiter and Mars are the two bright interlopers on either side of the circle — the former not far from the Twin Stars, the latter near Aldebaran, the right eye of Taurus the Bull. The V-shaped Hyades cluster marks the face of the animal, while another star cluster, the Pleiades, indicates a spear-wound in the bull's shoulder. The Hyades stars are moving together through space, headed toward a point east of Orion the Hunter; Aldebaran is not a member of the cluster. See how many of the Pleiades you can glimpse with the unaided eye. In a dark sky, you should see at least six of the stars arranged in a small dipper shape. Binoculars and telescopes reveal scores more in this popular little cluster. Finally, the Double Cluster of Perseus, located between the \"J\" of Perseus and the \"M\" of Cassiopeia, can be viewed with the naked eye at its best now high in the north. With a telescope, the twin patches are resolved into hun- dreds of stars each. The Double Cluster is much farther away from us (7,000 and 8,000 light years) and much younger (several million years old) than either the Hyades or Pleiades. FLYING WINGS, Continued cle (ARV) and privately displayed it to a limited audience at Norton AFB on November 12, 1988. If we have made a continuous study in secret of alien craft since 1947, then it is likely that we have developed a replica at this stage. The Norton ARV was depicted as a typical flanged saucer, but other \"manta ray\" shapes are conceivable. The Aviation Week article surmises that the triangular aircraft are possible prototypes of the Navy A-12 aircraft, but I wonder how many prototypes are needed when at least three were seen flying soundlessly in formation over the Antelope Valley? Also the 11 sightings reported in the Aviation Week article include the boomerang sightings of 1988. These big boomerangs should belong in a separate category. Witnesses are very impressed by their size and slow movement. Whether spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin or advanced military prototypes, of this there is no doubt: strange air- craft continue to fly over the Califor- nia deserts, giving mute testimony to the very real existence of UFOs.

A little while later U.S. Air Force Gen. Daniel James, commanding general of NORAD, came back through channels and asked me to declassify the report. Apparently General James wanted to provide the information to people who were interested in it.\" On January 20, 1979, a spokesman for the National Research Council said that the UFOs sighted over Ontario on the llth were layers of crystallized ice in the atmosphere. • 1980 About 6:50 p.m. on the third, a small aircraft had just taken off from Ozona, Texas, and was about 1,000 feet off the ground when the pilot spotted a glowing object coming from the di- rection of Sonora at a very high rate of speed. It was long in shape and pointed on both ends. About six miles out of Ozona, the object separated into two parts and the back section moved into a position directly under the front sec- tion and the two objects passed the plane. They were both the same intensi- ty of light. As the pilot watched the ob- jects move over Ozona their glow disap- peared. Instantly, the airplane engine stalled and all of its lights went out. A few seconds later the glow around the objects reappeared. The plane's engine started by itself and its lights A STATEMENT BY KENNETH A. WONG, J.D. MUFON Director of Legal Affairs \"I welcome this opportunity to serve the Board and the MUFON member- ship as Director of Legal Affairs to assist in our common pursuit of answers to this most fascinating enigma. While free time is all too scarce for each of us, I can think of few other avocational pursuits that are as thought-provoking as the study and investigation of the UFO phenomenon. Most of us are well aware of the intriguing and currently active events oc- curring in both Western Europe and North America; among other media, Time magazine and the Wall Street Journal have reported on these ongoing mysteries. Therefore, your continued interest and volunteer efforts in support of MUFON come at a time when irrefutable confirmation of other-world interac- tion may soon be revealed, whether that information comes by way of even- tual government disclosures or, by the revelatory actions of intelligences that are external to and supersede the controls and preferences of terrestrial governments. We therefore share a profound and enduring trans-national interest with our MUFON colleagues worldwide, and since mankind may be on the brink of a new perception of himself and his part in Creation, I hope you will share my view that this is a most exciting time to be alive, curious and open-minded.\" came on. Both objects then dropped to a lower altitude and moved away toward the Mexican border. Five additional witnesses on the ground also observed the objects. Later that same evening that could have been the same object was observed in the middle of U.S. Highway 87, SE of Sterling, Texas, and about 75 miles north of Ozona. The ob- ject was sitting on the highway and lunged upward to avoid being hit by a car occupied by two women.
