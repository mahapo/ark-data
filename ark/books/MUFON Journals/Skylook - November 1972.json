Ludwig first noticed an oval-shaped object flying parallel to the car and first thought it must b e the reflection of the car headlights on the telephone line8 as it appeared as \"a dim lighttr or \"the moon with a shadow over it.\" But as they turned a corner, the object passed directly over them and landed in a field. Almost at once it shot back into the sky and \"got real bright,\" Mrs. Ludwig said. The object then made a secorrj. ltnding in another field \"and lit up the field.It hrs. Ludwig said, \"It was round and it was big and looked like rays were coming out of it.\" The family reached their home--the Delmar Zweygardt farm where Mr. Ludwig - is employed--and were so frightened \"their knees were knocking together.\" On failing to catch another glimpse of the object from their second story windows, they decided to telephone the sheriff. The sighting was reported on radio and a call was made to NORAD who reported nothing unusual on their radar. During the sighting, of ten minutes duration, theLudwig car operated normally and no other sound was heard. The car windohs were open so all could get a better view of the object. 'lhe next morning deputies walked through the tall corn but failed to find any trace of a landing. One report states one landing was made in a corn field, theother on plowed ground.

As Mr. and Mrs. Ludwig did not agree as to the probable site of the two landings, Sheriff George Hubbard then dispatched a plane to fly over the fields.

As he approached 1-70, the object was settling over a pasture east of the drive, north of 1-70. he called r~trolman brown who raced to the scene in his cer and arrived in time to see the object rise out of the field and speed away southeastward. \"lt was big,\" Carter said, \"very bright, cta~ging from red and green blinking colors to bright white, so bright you couldn't look at it. It lit up the pasture.\" Brown also said the entire area was \"lit up like daytime.\" \"Then, just as I got out a€ my car,\" brown continued, \"I saw a shot of light go strcight up mto the air and then veer or level off to travel in a southeesterly direction.\" On a telephone report from Gem, Kans., about eight miles east of Lolby, and on orders of the police disp~tcher Carter and Brown drove toward Gem. \"he saw a very bright, colored ob:ect in the sky over Gem,\" Carter re- porter. \"It was about three to four miles away. khen it was moving fast it was bright white, and when it was st~tionery there were alternating red and green patterns o n this.\" As the object went on northeast toward Rexford, Brown and Carter decided not to follow.

The woman said she had stopped just north of where the sighting had occurred to ask people who were building a new home if they had seen the object. The man on a bull dozer said he had seen nothing. But another man said he had heard a funny noise. The woman said she had heard the noise--\"a high pitched whinew and she still had a headache from it. No trace of the object could be found.

More UFO Reports from Wisconsin According to a report in the Sept. 28, 1972 issue of the \"Milwaukee sentinel.\" UFOs are still beine sighted in Wisconsin. On Tuesday, Sept . 26, six sighting~ were reportez at- linto on- ville, including one by a man who claimed that a high intensity spot- light from a motionless object followed him around a field about four miles west of Appleton. Dozens of shoppers stopped in their tracks on the sidewalks of Horton- ville the same night and claimed a flying object was blinking red and white lights over the village's main street. Individual cases have ranged from claims of spotlights bathing cars in bright light that burned out electrical systems to some reports of paint being burned off automobiles. Sheriff's deputies from three counties have reported sighting the same strange objects hovering a few miles away. At one time earlier in the month, nine officers, three from each county, were chasing the same light but never traced it. Nearly all of the objects have been seen shortly after sundown or around midnight. Each has been described as of undetermined ,~ a size and shape usually seen about one mile in the distance. lhere are \"red and white flashing lights\" and sometimes the objects have been \"in pairs that seem to be passing lights back and forth.\" The K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base in Upper Wichigan and several civil- ian airports in the area have been notified and questioned and some- times can come up with a low flying plane as the answer.

Shifflet and two crew members of the TYA 745 flying from Okinawa to Bangkok saw the object appearing \"as a brilliant bluish-white ballw at 11 a.m. when they were cruising 10,000 met- ers over the western Pacific about 560 km. southeast of Okinawa. \"Capt. Shifflet reported the unidentified object was traveling in a south-southeasterly direction at outer space speed,\" the spokesman said. \"The object was best described as appearing to be a space object as its passage was too fast for a comet though the main body was similar to that of a comet,\" he said. The spokesman said the object, which was \"several times the magni- tude of the brightest planet \" was approximately visible for one minute and was also seen by Flight 485 of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. This was reported in the \"Japan Times,\" Sept. 24, 1972. At about the same time this object wks sighted by the TWA crewmen, two photos were taken by Masahiro Asanuma (211, a student, living at Yorimiya, Naha City, Okinawa. He was at a youth center in the cent,r,i part of Ikinavia Islknd, tegether with ;bout 40 schoolmates, who also witnessed the cbject at about 8:30 p.m. A bright object, brighter than the moon, appeared in the north-northwestern . , sky at about 50 degrees end moved from the west to the east. lhe students first thought an airplane was burning, then cried, \"No, it's a flying saucer !\" Mr. Asanuma ai~ed his camera st the object and releasee the shutter four times. The first two shots were failures, but the object was caught in the other two. The object disappeored into the cloud about two minute8 later. There were scores of other witnesses of the same or the similar object at about the same time in other cities of Okinawa. he of the witnesses, of Nago City, described the object as \"trailing the tail as a star, but it was less bright and proceeded with the slow speed as when the airplane is goinr to land, and definitely not the ccmet.\" A drawing of the object roughly resembles a sketch of a sea gull wings spread. Mr. Takanashi is tryinc to obtain the actual photos.7 Mr. Takanashi writes it is not definite that this is the same object which was observed by the pilot and crew members of the 'WA and KLM flights as reports coming in differ as to direction and speed of the object.

At first-she thought the light was a bright star, then realized it was too large. As it came closer and closer, she could see a light go on and off; and when the light was on, she could see the outline of the object clearly. She described it as two umbrellas, put together, with the handles off. She could see the ribs clearly. She judged it to be 3 or h miles north of Laddonia.

Tom Jones, age 11, was in the family living room of the farm home near Gresham, Wisconsin, the night of August 30, 1972. It was 9:30 and the family was watching television. Tom noticed a high pitched whine from outeide, and went out to see what it was. A large orange egg-shaped object came out of the east, came across in front of Tom, dropped several feet, then returned to again cross in front of the boy before rising to its former level and moving away to the east and disappearing over the horizon. Tom described the object as beiT as large as an addition added to their home (the addition meas- uring 1 x 20 feet). It was a clear, calm moonlit night. Another member of the family came out in time to catch a glimpse of the object, and a third member was too late as she had remained indoors to try to calm the dog which was very excited. The family remembered the TV picture became \"snowyw when the object passed over. Five minutes after the sighting, Tom's eyes began to swell and his ears ached. The family physician was consulted the next day. The object which 'om said was \"as bright as the sunn was observed for about a minute and a half.

The glassy inclusions, however, are similar to those found in meteor fragments.\" Meteors in space reach speeds of more than 40 miles per second, Jones said. Dwyer could count himself fortunate that if the object that struck him was, indeed, a meteorite, its sp~ed had been cut to a relatively slow 100 feet per second by the earth s atmosphere, Jones said.

If we are to believe that individuals have actually observed unusual landed objects which leave behind physical traces, then, I feel, we must also take a serious look at the occupant cases. In the physical trace file of 458 reports, we find that 22 occupants; 37% of these were seen by two or more witnesses. number of witnesses to a single occupant sighting is ten. Occupants are described as being small, normal or large in size. 61% are described as less than 4 feet in height.

At this date at about 10:25 p.m. a phone call was received from the Greensburg State Police stating a report had just been received of a UFO sighting on a dairy farm in an isolated area several miles off the main road. Cordon and several from his group went to the farm immediately and found Mr. and Mrs. X and their children immediately saying that they had seen the UFO again just a short time prior to their arrival and asking if anyone else had reported seeing the light. They reported the following: they were just finishing their chores about 9:50 p.m. when all af a sudden above a shed, a bright white beam of concentrated light appeared. The light did not move, shining directly down the right side of a silo roof. Then the light moved slowly toward the reat and a bright orange object with no discernible shape--only a light sourcew appeared. It seemed to the X family the white beam came from the orange object which then moved slowly to the west toward Hiddtletown and disappeared from view. There had been no sound. The family went indoors and a short time later Mrs. X glanced out the bathroom window to see a bright orange and white light flashing on and off over the top of the orchard. The light was very low above the trees and seemed to be slowly descending. Mrs. X ran outdoors, and the object then circled around over the orchard and moved to the west. The entire family then went outside to see if they could see any- thing more and saw a bright orange light that seemed to be spinning over a mountain top in the direction of the \"Smith\" farm. They watched this for more than a half hour, then decided they should report the happenings. Fearing ridicule, the family asked that their names not be used. The investigators are convinced the X family made an honest report. April 24, 1972. A science teacher from a local high school and a skeptic re UFOs, changed his mind. At 10:30 p.m. the teacher noticed a bright object above Chestnut Mountain Ridge outside of Derry, Pa. The object was a bright yellow in color and was round. The witness, who is familiar with the sky pattern, stated the object was nany times the size of Vanue. The object moved very slowly from east to west and then would move back over its course. After watching it for 15 minutes, the teacher went indoors to get his binoculars. When he returned, the object had disappeared. May 11, 1972.

In July of 1953 above the small village of Boroaenky in the Iuhansk district, there flew a huge bullet shaped object which emitted a fiery tail and travelled at a speed of about 300 kilometers per hour without leaving any trece in the sky nor making any sound. I would estimate that the diameter of that strange object was about 250 meters. It was moving from the north to the south. After flying in a straight line of flight it suddenly went straight up at a tremen- .dous speed and disappeared in the dark of the night. Signed: Oleksij Oli jnyk. 2. In the same village of Borozenky at midnight in August of 1964, I observed an object of a cylindrical shape, which was about three ' times as large as an airplane. It was flying from north to the south. At first it appeared to be flying at an altitude of about 1000 meters and parallel to the surface of the Earth, end then, when it was at an angle of about 60 degrees on the horizon it went rapidly straight up. It was yellow in color and a turbulent sound was h,eard. Long flames were being emitted from the rear of this object.

The legend describes her as the daughter of Cassiopeia and Cepheus, Queen and King of Ethiopia. Andromeda culiminates et 9 PM on Nov. 5. It is easily located north- east of the great square of Pegasus (the Winged Horse). In this constell- ation is M-31, the nearest and brightest of the spiral galaxies. The light that strikes the eye when this galaxy is observed has been travel- ing through space for about 2 million years. M-31 is estimated to be 180,000 light years in diameter and is one of the largest galaxies known, containing about 150 billion stars. Our own Milky Way galaxy is about half the size of M-31 in comparison. The spiral arms of this great island universe contain bright blue giant stars and nebulous regions while the nuclear hub is a vast swarm of red and yellow stars. In 1885 E. Hartwig discovered a supernova in M-31. Lhis star is one of the first extra-galactic supernova ever observed.

N.Y. 10016; 95#, plus 154 postage if or- dered by mail). In many ways, iendyls book is quite similar to those of other authors who have investigated the historical/religious implications of Ufology and related subjects. However, rather like Erich von Daniken, Sendy puts forth his arguments without relying on the mass of UFO evidence to support him. While he considers that the \"Celestials\" were the basis for beliefs in a god or gods, Sendy does not feel that such Biblical personages as Moses were in direct contact with space beings. In this he differs from most of the other writers on UFOs and religion. To my way of thinking, the book's material is too speculative to make any real impact on tho reader's consciousness. However, I do consider it worth reading, if only to obtain a somewhat different view on this particular aspect of UFO re- search. The late Dr. Wilhelm Reich was a controversial figure in life and con- tinues to remain so after his death. Many Ufologists mey not know of Reich's interest in the UFO subject, although he conducted experiments concerning the propulsion method which he believed'the UFOs used. Reich was perhaps best known for his discovery of a primordial atmospheric life energy which he named \"orgone.\" A contaminated form of org~ne--~oranur~ was considered highly dangerous to all life forms. Reich believed that UFOs were propelled by orgone energy and his experiments allegedly con- firmed that belief. Researcher Jerome Eden, who h&s been involved in both UFO and orgone reseerch for several yeers, hss now written a book entitled ORCONE ENERGY: THE ANSWER TO ATOMIC SUICIDE. Eden obviously believes that Reich was on the right track and his foreeful writing style makes for very interesting reading. The book is available from Exposition Press, 50 Jer- - icho Turnpike, Jericho, N. Y. 11753 for $6.00 (plus 30# postage by.mai1). THE TRANSPARLNT PEOPLE by Frederick von Kruger (as told to William J.
