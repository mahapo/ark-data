A UFO was sighted and videotaped and is mindblowing. The video was shot in the Mexico City area in broad daylight. What you see on the tape is a set of large apartment complexes. A flying saucer is hovering just a few hun- dred feet over the ground of this city. The saucer wobbles in the video, then dans to the right quickly. Moves behind one of the complexes, then emerges over the top of it. It then proceeds behind another complex but never comes out the other side. It simply vanished. The tape lasts under 30 seconds and probably will be a bigger controversy than the \"Alien Autopsy\"! The disc appears to be around one mile away and over 50 feet in diameter. It's not a little white dot on video or a hockey puck. This is right in your face video, it's really shocking. I would compare it to the Paul Villa photos of the disc. It's a really large image on the video. So far every person who has seen it was floored to say the least. It has an effect on you. almost like witness- ing the actual sighting. It also reminds me of the \"plasma\" craft videotaped by Carlos Diaz. The details of the saucer are this: It ro- tates counterclockwise around one revolu- tion per second. There is a dome on top and a black hole on the bottom. There are what appear to be windows or lights rotating on it. Sometimes different colors are seen on it. The most impressive thing about it is the wobbling. There are also other independent wit- nesses other than the cameraman. It's the piece of evidence UFOlogy has been wait- ing for since the invention of the video cam- era.

Mexican TV Airs Video of Hovering Saucer From: UFO ROUNDUP Volume 2, Number 39 October 12, 1997 Editor: Joseph Trainor On Sunday, September 28, and on the following Sunday, October 5, 1997, from 7 to 8 p.m., Mexican TV anchorman Jaime Maussan aired videotape of a hovering UFO on his show \"Tercera Milenio\" (Third Millenium). The videotape was shot on August 6 in a residential neighborhood of Mexico City. Twenty-five seconds of video show the clearly-detailed UFO in a cloudy, smoggy sky. The UFO is gray and metallic and has no blinking lights. However, it does have a strange rotating motion. The scene shows the object motionless in the sky. Then it moves from left to right on the TV screen, hovers for many seconds, then zips away at a high rate of speed.

Introduction S ince I published my preliminary find- ings of alleged alien abductees who experienced possible kidnappings by special military/intelligence units, I received new information, especially from North American abductees and abduction re- searchers. Most of this information has not been previously published. The responses I received after the first article was published, show that there are more alleged alien ab- ductees who have experienced unwanted human/military contacts (MILABs) during their lives. In August 1997,1 published an overview of this study, coauthored by my wife, in a comprehensive book titled Covert Operations. By summarizing our findings we found that [1,2]: 1. MILAB victims are harassed by dark, unmarked helicopters near their houses. The mysterious helicopter activity goes back to the late sixties, early seventies, when they showed an interest in animal mutilations, but not in alleged alien abductees. 2. MILAB victims have not only alien abduction experiences, they also report that they were kidnapped by a certain branch of human/military personnel. They describe being drugged, taken to hospital-like rooms, as well as underground military facilities, where they describe seeing men in white lab coats. Here they are examined, interrogated and sometimes implanted with unknown de- vices. Readers who are interested in more de- tails should read my first MILAB article [1]. We are also hoping to have an English edition of our book, Covert Operations, published and available in the United States. Until this project reaches fruition, I believe the results I publish here in the second arti- cle will lead the open-minded researcher to three important questions. 1. Is it possible that secret human experi- ments or covert operations are occuring in western democracies? \" 2. What is the human agenda which seems to be involved in the alien abduction phenomenon and what is the purpose of MILABs: military abductions of abductees? 3. Is there a military interest in develop- ing brain implants, virtual reality bio-chips, holographic image projection, cloaking de- vices, and mind altering weapons? The existence of these technologies would support the hypothesis that such se- cret experiments could occur on humans and these experiments are being hidden from Congress and the public by placing the funding inside secret or \"black\" projects. II. Documented History of Secret Mind and Behavior Control Experiments Everyone who refuses to believe that se- cret experiments and covert operations have been performed on people, including chil- dren, should look at the documented history of military/intelligence radiation experi- ments as well as mind and behavior control projects which are now known to the public. In addition to the United States and Canada, the British press reported that even the Ministry of Defense (MoD) has carried out secret radiation experiments on humans dur- ing the last forty years. In 1994, the United States government lifted the lid on secret experiments with scant regard for the subjects — many of whom were disadvantaged people.[3] For about 30 years after World War II the Department of Defense (DoD), the CIA and various non-government research organiza- tions conducted medical research on thou- sands of citizens, often without their know- ledge. This research was largely concerned with radiation exposure, nerve gas, LSD and various biological agents. Recently it was disclosed that radiation experiments were performed on more than 23,000 Americans in about 1,400 different projects during the thirty years following the war.[4] The people on whom these experiments were conducted were soldiers, prisoners, people considered to be mentally defective (both children and adults), hospital patients with terminal illnesses and pregnant poor women. Many of the scientists who con- Dr. Lammer is a scientist with the Austrian Space Research Institute. He is the Austrian rep- resentative for the Mutual UFO Network, A MU- FON consultant in geophysics, and a member of the Society for Scientific Ex- ploration (SSE).

November 1997 Number 355 Pages ducted these Nazi-like experiments were re- spectable academics. Dr. Ewen Cameron was such a scientist on the surface. However, he led a CIA-funded laboratory at McGill University during the 1950's where patients were used as guinea pigs in brain- washing experiments. Some subjects were given ECT \"therapy\" twice daily, while others were drugged and kept unconcisious for weeks or months. They were injected with huge amounts of hallucinogens, and subjected to long-term sensory deprivation.[5] A panel, appointed by the Clinton administration in 1994 to look into these matters, has so far docu- mented 400 government backed biomedical experiments involving humans between 1944 and 1975. The purpose of these exper- iments may never be fully known. It is not certain when these experiments stopped, if they stopped at all, but they were still going on in mid-1970s.[4] The Canadian psychiatrist and specialist on trauma and dissociation, Dr. Colin Ross, presented a paper at the 9th Annual Western Clinical Conference on Trauma and Dissociation in Orange County, California. Dr. Ross described evidence from released CIA-FOIA documents showing that the agency has conducted research on the cre- ation of Manchurian candidates since World War II. [6] Dr. Ross and research organiza- tions like the New York-based Advocacy Committee for Human Experimentation Survivors - Mind Control (ACHES-MC) also came across survivors of horrific ex- periments involving electroshock, drugs, brain implants, sensory deprivation, psychic driving; people having been locked in cages, forced sleep and sexual and ritual abuse.[7,8] Once selected, victims have been used repeatedly as human lab animals throughout their lifetimes in one externally controlled and monitored experiment after another. In 1997 ACHES-MC delivered a video- document to President Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Chretien. ACHES-MC requested a presidential hear- ing and the declassification of government records relating to alleged mind control ex- periments. Experiments that were conducted on unwitting children and adults and which were funded by the United States govern- ment from the 1940s onwards. This video- tape contains testimony from both children and adults - alleged survivors of federally funded mind control experimentation. It also contains testimony from therapists, psychiatrists and psychologists.[8] Their victims, however, do not report alleged alien/UFO contacts like MILAB victims re- port, but some of the MILAB experiences also fit in the pattern of abuse described by alleged mind control victims. This short excursion in the past of secret experimentation on humans supports the MILAB hypothesis of covert operations against civilians, although solid underlining evidence is not easy to present. III. A Possible Purpose of MILABs Since I now have more MILAB informa- tion, I believe the whole alien/human ab- duction scenario is more complex than I thought at first. It seems to me that there are indications that more than one human agenda, possibly three, may be involved in the unexplained alien abduction phenome- non. Each of these agendas probably has its own focal point involving alleged alien ab- ductees. It seems to me that the first group is in- terested in mind and behavior control exper- iments. I found indications of sensory depri- vation experiments, liquid breathing experi- ments, experiments on electromagnetic stimulation of the temporal lobes, brain re- search and implant research. A second group seems to be interested in biological or genetic research. Some MI- LAB victims recall seeing humans in tubes filled with liquid and genetically altered an- imals in cages during their alleged kidnap- pings inside military underground facilities. It should be noted that alien abductees \"without\" military contacts also remember similar scenarios inside UFOs or alleged alien crafts. The third group seems to be a military task force, which has been operating since the eighties. This group appears to be inter- ested in the UFO/alien abduction phenome- non for information gathering purposes. This would be a logical consequence if someone or a group of people with the \"need to know\" considers alien abductions to be real. It seems to me that the leaders of this military task force believe that some alien abductions are real and that they have national security implications. It could be that the second and third group are working together, because they could share their in- terest in genetic studies and their findings ~ from alleged alien abductees."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL I will now concentrate on tank and tube experiences of alleged alien and MILAB abductees who represent victims of the be- fore mentioned groups. It should be noted that they are not alone and that their cases are only examples from a much larger pool of victims. IV. Tank and Tube Experiences Michelle (pseudonym) had her first con- scious memory of a typical alien abduction experience with non-human beings at the age of eight. She remembers classic alien abduction experiences with three to four foot-tall beings with large heads. But her following experiences, however, have nothing to do with alien abductions. • Michelle then had traumatic flashbacks; re- ality-like dreams and some consciously re- membered MILAB events. The memory gaps were investigated by a Ph.D. hyp- notherpist and MUFON consultant, with the use of regressive hypnosis. Michelle and a boyfriend had a missing time/kidnapping experience during 1970 near a campsite at Ditch Plains in Montauk, New York. She remembers that both were taken by armed military personnel to the now closed Montauk base. After they were separated, Michelle was escorted inside an underground facility where she had several frightening experiences.[9,10] She remembers being in an examination room with machines, stainless steel equip- ment and a table covered in white. Michelle was placed on the table and strapped down. After a few minutes a group of five to six people, including one female, came into the .room. All of them wore medical clothes consisting of white gowns. Surgical masks covered their faces. They turned her head sideways and shaved a small portion of her head behind her right ear. She was com- pletely conscious, but was immobilized and she could not speak.[9] Michelle remembers that someone was writing something on the skin behind her ear. After this she got an intravenous (IV) injection, she felt a prick in her arm and lost consciousness and awoke with her boyfriend, who was also kidnapped, later on the beach. The next hypnosis session revealed more traumatic flashbacks of being in an isolation tank. The following experience was investi- gated during an emotional hypnosis regres- sion session. Michelle had never had this experience while under hypnosis before. She recalled being in a dark place, while she floated in something that felt slightly heav- ier than warm water. [9] Before this experience Michelle recalled being naked on a table. She had wires at- tached all over her body and she saw a doc- tor in a white lab coat standing next to her. The next experience was uncovered via a deep trance regression which probed again into the isolation tank experience. Michelle remembered once again that she was in a black enclosed area where she struggled and was afraid of drowning. The experience scared her a lot and she wanted out of the tank. She felt that the liquid was heavier than water, was warm and smelled of a minty odor. She was able to move her arms and legs slightly as well as her head. She felt the smooth surface of the isolation tank on her right when she streched out her arm. She was completely isolated in the dark tank when a kind of artificially induced \"out-of-body\" experience began, or she be- gan to hallucinate. I researched the literature of sensory depri- vation experiments and came across such isolation tanks which were invented by Dr. John Lilly.[ll] Dr. Lilly tried to find out how he could isolate the brain and mind. He considered the effects of light and its stimu- lation of the eyes, touch and pressure and their stimulation of the skin and even deep- lying organs within the body. Dr. Lilly looked at temperature differences, the ef- fects of clothing, the effects of gravitation, and the effects of heat and cold. Dr. Lilly visualized a soundproof tank in which the body could be supported in water that would be maintained at the proper tem- perature in such a way as to maintain the generation of head within the body. He found such a tank inside a soundproof chamber in an isolated building near the campus of the National Institute of Health. This tank was constructed during World War II for experiments by the Office of Naval Research on metabolism of underwa- ter swimmers. This was the beginning for research on isolation which later included the use of drugs.[11] It should be noted that during the late fifties and early sixties Dr. Lilly experi- mented also with brain implants. During this period, Dr. Lilly was contacted by covert intelligence services and researchers for the Department of Defense (DoD). Dr. [9] Michelle: Hypnosis Transcript.

November 1997 Number 355 PageS Lilly wrote in his book The Scientist, that while he was at the National Institute of Health, the isolation tank experiments, like the brain-electrode experiments, became subject to the politics of the time. [11] As the isolation tank research became known throughout government agencies, various individuals called him to find out about it. Dr. Lilly claims that among them were re- searchers working under the auspices of the Army. Their interest was in the area of brainwashing captured prisoners of war. Dr. Lilly was asked if the isolation tank could be used to change belief systems of persons under coercion. They wanted to use the isolation tanks and sensory deprivation experiments for brain washing and other mind control experiments. Dr. Lilly visual- ized situations in which this method would be used under coercion. By careful control of the stimulation of isolated individuals, their belief systems could be changed in di- rections desired by the controlling persons. Dr. Lilly was convinced that the military/in- telligence community would use his isola- tion technique for covert experiments.[ll] I think, that Michelle's experiences show us that this was true and that there is enough evidence that she is one victim of such de- privation tank experiments. One should note however, that this specific experience had nothing to do with aliens, although I do not know how her alien abduction experiences fit in this scenario. A s I noted in my first MILAB paper, the presence of human military personnel inhabiting the same physical reality as alien beings are unbelievable for skeptics as well as serious open-minded abduction re- searchers. Although Michelle's before men- tioned experiences were definitely terres- trial, she experienced a high strangeness close-encounter during the same MILAB. She experienced traumatic flashbacks of a reptiloid creature, so this was also investi- gated. She described being escorted by military personnel into a dark office-like room where she was raped by a reptiloid creature. I don't know what this traumatic experience means. I don't think, however, that the mili- tary worked with this reptoid creature. It could be possible that Michelle was drugged with an hallucinogen and projected the reptoid as a kind of screen memory, al- though she described the skin and other fea- tures of the creature quite realistically. Was this particular experience the prod- uct of a mind control procedure? We should take this under consideration because her other experiences in the underground facil- ity were completely terrestrial. In addition, recent hypnosis sessions performed on Michelle In July 1997, revealed that she may have been used in various mind control experiments during her lifetime.[12] During a two hour session Michelle re- membered to be in a room with two to three men who were in charge of other men who were wearing lab coats. Before this she was in some kind of examination room, where someone mounted something on her head. She described silver colored tongs, pinching at her temples and inducing intense pain in her head. This experience is reminiscent of an ex- periment involving the stimulation of the temporal lobe region by the use of magnetic fields. Dr. Michael Persinger, a neuroscien- tist at Laurentian University of Sudbury, Ontario, demonstrated that one can artifi- cially produce mystical experiences, out-of- body excursions and other psychic experi- ences by stimulating the temporal lobes with the application of magnetic fields across the brain. He discovered that such experiences are linked with excessive bursts of electrical activity in the temporal lobes.[13] A research target would have a helmet or a similar device placed on their head. An artificially generated magnetic field would mimic the firing patterns of neurons in the temporal lobes of the brain. Dan Wright, head of the MUFON Abduction Transcription Project, reviewed his records for tube or tank experiences of alleged alien abductees. He found several cases in his files during which the abductee saw a tube during their experience, but did not identify anything or anyone inside it.[14] In four cases, however, abductees de- scribed large clear tubes and recalled either being placed inside it or seeing someone else inside. Two of these four abductees saw an alien creature in the tube. Dan Wright's files reveal three cases in which the ab- ductee was in a tank filled with liquid and in two cases the victim was forced to breathe the liquid! None of the abductees who was placed in a tube or tank reported any un- usual mind set such as out-of-body experi- ence or remote viewing during their time in these containers. \"Two\" of seven tank cases reported military involvement, but not on the same night as the tube or tank episode."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL MILAB victim Lisa (pseudonym) had tank experiences similar to the abductees in Dan Wright's study, but Lisa's memories are from conscious recollections. Lisa was kid- napped and brought to a military under- ground facility, where she saw naked hu- mans floating in tubes. Lisa for instance claims that she was forced by humans into some type of pool filled with a golden yel- low bubbly fluid, while other humans looked at her. Lisa has traumatic recollec- tions that her kidnappers tried to force her and other victims to breathe in the liq- uid.[15] In two of the before mentioned cases the abductee was forced to breathe the liquid like Lisa. The hypnosis transcripts re- veal that the liquid breathing experiences were traumatic for the abductees. Both ab- ductees were totally immersed in the liquid and both reported that they could breathe the fluid. [14] If one reviews the scientific literature which is available about fluid breathing, one finds that physically taking fluid into the ! lungs and breathing liquid instead of air would revolutionize diving. The concept of fluid breathing began in the mid 1960s when Dr. J. Kylstra, a physiologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo re- alized that salt solutions could be saturated with oxygen at high pressures. Dr. Kylstra worked in a US Navy compression chamber and performed experiments on mice. He was able to keep animals alive for up to 18 hours. However, because carbon dioxide was not removed fast enough from the sys- tem, it quickly built-up to near toxic levels. This problem was obviously a stumbling block when it came to using his procedure on humans.[16] T he next step in fluid breathing came in 1966, with Dr. Leland Clark's liquid- breathing mouse experiment.[17] Dr. Clark developed a technique where a mouse sur- vived over twenty hours breathing fluid at 18 degrees centigrade. All animals in the early studies suffered pulmonary damage, but that was due to toxic impurities of the fluorocarbon, chemical interaction of the fluorocarbon with the lung, or some un- known effect was undetermined. This pul- monary damage mystery as well as the problem of the elimination of carbon diox- ide and the fact that the fluorocarbon tended to be retained by body tissues would have to be solved before the process could be at- tempted on human subjects. During the following years, the technique of fluid breathing was refined and im- proved. Liquid ventilation tests of the early 1990s proved to be successful. Scientists kept dogs alive in a perfluorocarbon medium for about two hours. After removal the dogs were slightly hypoxic, but returned to normal life after a few days.[16] After these tests on animals the procedure was ready for human subjects. The medical community now has a treatment for respira- tory distress syndrome, the leading cause of death in premature infants. In addition, I suspect that liquid breathing experiments on humans, would be extremely useful for mil- itary/Navy/intelligence purposes such as submarine escape and UT oxygen support facilities. Alien abductees, such as Betty Andreasson reported being placed inside a tube filled with liquid for the compensation of large gravity forces during a high UFO acceleration period. One abductee of Dan Wright's files describes such an experience inside such a tube: \"...it's like water in there, it's like being in a swimming pool, only I can see through the sides...it feels like we are moving. Where are we going? Whoo, that's fast. Feels like we are moving fast. Oh! And one's standing outside. He's telling me, that's why we had to put you in here, be- cause we are moving too fast.... Acceleration. Something about gravity forces too much.\"[14] It is interesting to note that under hypno- sis this abductee reported how the abductors put something in her nose before they put her in the tube. This means that this ab- ductee was not forced to breathe the liquid. Recent scientific studies of visual and pho- tographic sightings of UFOs carrying out \"impossible\" high speed maneuvers by Dr. Bruce Maccabee would support such grav- ity force compensation tube experiences if the abductee was indeed in a real UFO. [18] Dr. Bruce Maccabee stated in his article \"Acceleration,\" that a UFOnaut or abductee inside a UFO accelerating at 500 g's would be pushed by the walls of the craft with a force that would make him seem to weigh almost 500 times his weight on Earth. The body of an abductee might be crushed at that acceleration, and the skin might be pulled off the bones, unless the human was [15] Lisa: Personal com- munication, 1996, 1997.

Some of these abductees claim that the humans looked altered like hybrids.[14,19] These would fit the hypothesis of genetic research done by the \"greys.\" But there are also cases where abductees report human doctors escorting them through underground labora- tories where they have seen humans in clear tanks.[19] MILAB victim Christa Tilton de- scribed such an experience as: \"I did see what I thought were humans in clear tanks underground. The tanks were leaning about 25 degrees backward until they touched the wall. The room was a regular room ... like a laboratory. This was never viewed on a spacecraft. They seemed to be like I said, in a state of suspended animation. There was a clear liquid filled totally in the tank casing ... I believe these humans were being kept alive by some type of tubes behind their head. [20]\" Christa Tilton is not alone with such an 'experience. There are other abductees who claim that they were taken to military un- derground facilities where they have seen people in such glass or plastic tubes.[19] Some of these MILABs report rows of sev- eral identical people, each one in its own tube. One could speculate that someone clones human \"Dolly's\" in secret. Recently Japanese scientists reported that a goat fetus has survived in an artificial womb for three weeks before its birth.[21] The scientists who designed the womb say that it could help premature human babies to survive. Dr. Yoshinori Kuwabara of Juntendo University in Tokyo and his col- leagues removed a goat fetus from its , mother 17 weeks into the pregnancy. They placed the fetus in a tank filled with liquid to simulate amniotic fluid. A machine pumped nutrients and oxygen into the ani- mal's blood. Dr. Kuwabara also hopes artifi- cial wombs could one day be used to help fetuses in the final stages of multiple preg- nancies when the womb becomes too cramped. Alien and MILAB abductees both de- scribe seeing small tubes or incubators in- side UFOs, as well as inside terrestrial un- derground research facilities. Most of the time the experiencer describes these infants appearing very ill. Alien abductees and ab- ductees with MILAB experiences suspect these infants may be hybrids. It would be logical for someone who is interested in cloning to develop and use arti- ficial wombs and incubators filled with nu- trient fluid for breeding purposes. Scientists who are working on biotechnology projects claim that cloning \"brainless\" humans for transplanting organs would be a reality in the future.[2] Presently, ethical considera- tions go against such Frankenstein-like re- search projects. A more science fiction-like purpose would be the creation of a geneti- cally engineered soldier who is immune to biological warfare and possible future ge- netic warfare attacks. Incredibly, the experi- ences of some MILAB victims suggest that such projects could already be going on be- hind the backs of the official medical re- search community. Therefore, it could be that secret research into artificial wombs and experiments on human fetuses are go- ing on hidden inside black projects. It is clear that alien abductees report tank and tube experiences inside UFOs that are similar to what some abductees report see- ing inside military research facilities, al- though such cases are a minority compared to pure alien abduction cases. Such similari- ties have also been found between the pro- cedures occuring to alleged alien abductees and mind control victims.[1,2] I now present a case where it appears that a secret military task force could be in charge of similar oriented black genetic pro- jects. This is a well investigated case in Dan Wright's MUFON Abduction Transcription Project files where human/military person- nel kidnap a woman from her house and drive her to a secret place.[14] She is car- ried into the building and placed onto an ex- amining table. Her feet.are placed into stir- rups, that is used for gynecological exami- nations. A female doctor conducts a gyne- cological exam. She searches for an em- bryo, but never finds any. The MILAB vic- tim remembers the officer in charge as an older man with silver hair who threatens and interrogates her. She loses conscious- ness sometime during the examination or on the trip back to her home. Interestingly, the military always kidnaps her on the same night or the night after an alien abduction experience. The activity of this military task force, which seems to be interested in particular alien abductees, would be a logical conse-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL quence if their leaders believed that some alien abductions are real. As I mentioned above, it seems that this group works to- gether with black project scientists who are interested in genetic research. It should be noted that the before mentioned abductee reported a tube experience but not on the same night as the military kidnapped her. She observed several tubes with different bodies inside and she was placed in front of a tube with a body of a tall blond human woman inside. She described the tube as a glass or plexiglass cylinder inside a UFO. Again, it should be noted that the above mentioned abductees are not alone and that their cases represent a larger sample of indi- viduals. V. Actual Military Research/Interest in Virtual Reality Brain Implants and Mind Altering Weapons. Most people are now aware that secret mind and behavior control and radiation ex- periments were performed during the post war phase up to the seventies. We should ask if there is an interest in covert experi- ments today. MILAB sceptics who claim that the results of this study are rubbish [22] should look into recently declassified Air Force studies [23,24], scientific proceedings for military technologies and news articles concerning exotic weapon research.[25] A recent paper published for the Air Force as it looks ahead to its technological needs in the year 2025, [24] has the title \"Information Operations: A new War- Fighting Capability.\" In this paper, the au- thors write about a brain-implanted cyber situation.[26] The authors propagate im- planted microscopic brain chips which per- form two functions. First, the bio-chip con- nects the implanted individual to a constel- lation of integrated or smart satellites (IIC) in low earth orbit, creating an interface be- tween the implanted person and the infor- mation resources. The implant relays the processed information from the IIC to the user. Second, the bio-chip creates computer- generated mental visualization based upon the user's request. The visualization encom- passes the individual and allows the user to place himself into a selected \"battlespace.\" In addition, a wide range of lethal or non- lethal weapons will be linked to the IIC, al- lowing special authorized implanted users (super-cyber-soldiers) to directly employ these weapons. This means, a soldier would be capable of viewing the normal world plus an overlay of information identifying and describing specific objects in his field of view. He can now evaluate the threat these targets repre- sent and order a variety of weapon systems to engage and destroy these targets from the distance. One can see from such military studies that secret research in human-brain-machine and virtual reality implant research is al- ready underway. Some of the references in this paper refer to military research insti- tutes and are classified for the public. Since the authors write that implanting devices in human beings raises ethical and public rela- tion issues today, we should ask who the guinea pigs are of these futuristic research projects? Another interesting paper concerning \"Information Warfare\" is classified and only individuals with appropriate security clear- ances can obtain a copy from the Defense Technical Information Center in Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. [27] However, you can read in the abstract that this paper explores holographic image projection, cloaking devices and mul- tispectral camouflage which will provide enhanced military deception capability. The most promising technology is the creation of synthetic environments that an adversary thinks are real! They write further that re- search for PSYWAR-operations is done to influence a target by using holographic im- age projection with messages conveying the desired effect. We should again ask: Who are the adversaries and test targets for these research projects? A recent article in U.S. News & World Report revealed that the United States mili- tary has developed mind altering weapons, and has explored acoustics, microwaves and brain-wave manipulation to alter sleep pat- tern.[25] Interestingly, they have a picture of a military helicopter in the article which points a directed energy beam to a house. According to a Pentagon briefing, acoustic and sonic weapons can vibrate the insides of humans to stun them, nauseate them, or even liquefy their bowels. Dr. Eldon Byrd was the head of an exotic electromagnetic weapons project in the early 1980s. He conducted most of his re- search at the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute in Bethesda, Md. Dr. Byrd claimed that he and his colleagues [22] Alexander, Victoria: MILAB Misdemeanor? MUFON UFO Journal, No. 346 February, 1997.

He used ELF (Extremly Low Frequency) waves for stim- ulating the brain for the release of behavior regulating chemicals. By using these on hu- mans, the test subjects would cause instant flu-like symptoms and produce nausea. Since the field was extremely weak, they were undetectable and reversible. Dr. Byrd never tested any of his hardware in the field and his project scheduled for four years was closed down after two. Because the technique worked, he sus- pects that the program went black. Other scientists told U.S. News & World Report similar tales of research on electromagnetic radiation turning top secret once successful results were achieved.[25] There are clues that such work is continuing in black pro- jects. It is just possible that some MILAB victims are being used as the guinea pigs for these futuristic research programs. Because these projects are secretive, they are not un- der congressional oversight and alien ab- ductees are easy to ridicule. VI. Discussion One can assume that similar secret mili- tary research projects are being conducted for biological and genetic warfare projects. If we speculate that a core of the alien ab- duction phenomenon is indeed real, the same people who are behind these projects would have an interest in alien biology, ge- netics and mind control procedures. Since these research operations appear to be hid- den behind deep black projects, only certain people with the right \"need to know\" would really know what's going on. This is also the main problem for organisations who push for congressional hearings concerning such experiments on humans, secret genetic research and military involvement in the alien abduction phenomenon. Such projects are unacknowledged special access pro- grams like the stealth projects were, there- fore, most of the elected politicians do not know that this kind of research is being con- ducted. We must keep in mind that most MILAB victims claim they have seen alien beings and human military personnel working side by side. These claims should be carefully investigated. We need more research before one definitely concludes that alien beings and military personnel are working together.

Conspiracies: The Evolution of UFO Hypotheses by Jerome Clark Reviewed by Martin Kottmeyer T he title of this work conjures up expec- tations that this would likely be a com- prehensive historical survey of theories about UFOs, perhaps along the lines of Richard Haines' outline in the February 1987 Flying Saucer Review. Given the au- thor's longstanding involvement in ufology, his knowledge of the history of ideas in this field should be considerable and informa- tive. Despite stated ambitions by him to demonstrate how various ideas have evolved in the hope of providing insight into why ufologists believe what they be- lieve, it becomes evident that the project got abandoned at an early point and the author decided to focus in on a very few select heresies that he fears will give ufology \"an occultist aura\" it does not need or deserve. It begins well enough with a quest for the earliest obscure roots of the extraterrestrial hypothesis in the airship mania of the late 1800s. We get a little Fort, a little Palmer, and a little Keyhoe, but then the coverage of ETH becomes haphazard. He digs up a hys- terical article by Stringfield with no balanc- ing remarks on his better known book. Books by Aime Michel go missing in favor of nostalgic sneers at Morris Jessup's un- convincing and dead fantastic notions. Gray Barker and Waveney Girvan go missing in favor of Harold Wilkins and Olavo Fontes. The rest of ETH history is simply ignored. This cuts off Keyhoe's conversion from be- lief in alien benevolence to their being a danger that Congress would have to take ac- tion to defend against. It also means all the subsequent developments in ETH advocacy - the Lorenzens, McDonald, Fuller, Binder, Hall, Fowler, Hopkins and Jacobs to name but the most amazing losses - are unchroni- cled. If this is a study in evolving ideas, such a treatment of the purportedly domi- nant idea in ufology deserves puzzled ex- pressions at minimum. The handling pf the secret weapon theory is even more truncated and offbeat. We are told that there was no good evidence for it and that the otherworldly nature of UFOs worked against the idea. Yet there was some evidence for it, notably the Russian symbols in the Spitzbergen saucer crash and the sug- gestive location of the Oscar Linke landing near the Soviet border. Cases of guys in Navy uniforms, scarves, and baseball caps seen in the early years did not seem so other- worldly. While the author paints the ETH as becoming popular from the very outset of the saucer era, polls from 1947 into the Sixties show the secret weapons idea had clear dominance in the minds of the general public. One from 1968 showed 57% thought most ufos were due to secret defense pro- jects either in the U.S. or another country. Only 40% thought people were seeing space ships from another planet. The author chronicles none of the serious interest in the idea among military intelligence like Brigadier General George F. Schulgen's memo about German development of the Horton \"Parabola\" or Air Intelligence Report No. 100-203-79 from 1948 (reprinted in the July 1985 MUFON UFO Journal). Instead we get the fringier mater- ial of James Moseley and Leon Davidson. In contrast, the discussion of the space animal theory is lovingly expansive with a full cast of proponents. True, most of them are little known and the rescue from obscu- rity virtually heroic. They demonstrate the author's abilities when the enthusiasm bub- 40 pp., $16.00, from FUFOR, the Fund for UFO Research, PO Box 277, Mt.

His suggestion that it was a rival to the ETH, however, is hard to square with the tiny amount of attention it was given in either military circles or the writings of the leaders of the UFO movement. The true heart of the work is a passionate attack on the work of John Keel and Jacques Vallee. Keel gets put down as a rad- ical heretic - crude, pulpish, anti-intellec- tual, and from a recognizable tradition of crank literature. Evidently he is not refer- ring to ETH advocacy literature as anyone exposed to the pulpish excesses of Keyhoe might first be excused to suspect, but rather the occultic sphere of Meade Layne and Richard Shaver. The author plays up certain passages in Keel's writings to argue he was more-or-less a self-confessed demonologist. This interest in demons is then chronicled in Keel's intellectual parents, siblings, and bastard offspring. The author finds Keel's influence so pervasive that the ETH was largely marginalized in the writings of ufol- ogists in the 1970s. He elsewhere avers that ufologists are rationalists and materialists and so devoted to just investigating reports and correlating data, as against \"wondering about the Greater Meaning of it All,\" that they are the very soul of Baconian philoso- phy. Yet here he has ufology so possessed by the demon ideas of Keel as to zombie chase \"reasonable, testable, meaningful\" ole ETH from the stage of ufo history for a time. We never really get an account of the criticisms against the ETH, like noncontact and the fragility of cases under skeptical as- sault with their incomprehensibility taken en masse, nor the disenchantment with the landing predictions and fears of invasion and hostile aliens by the 70s. If this were truly an exercise to understand why ufolo- gists believe what they believe, such refusal to examine even the patina of the rhetoric overlaying the demons of the unconscious would make little sense. The real intent is laid bare in the final line of the book, \"Ufology, in other words, is not de- monology by another name.\" Isn't it? The fact that Keel existed and deposed the ETH proves wholly the opposite of what he's saying if taken literally. The intent is clearly metaphorical. The author believes that by naming the demons haunting the souls of the anti-ETH heretics he has helped to cast them out.

Pflock looks at the myths and rumors surrounding the fa- mous RAND Corporation report on Unidentified Flying Objects. In \"UFOs: For RAND Use Only,'' he demonstrates that truth is often more interesting (and stranger) than fiction. The RAND report, written by astronomer George Kocher, is eye-opening for a couple of reasons. First, it presents a highly intriguing UFO case in great detail, one involving independent witnesses and writing on the outside of the craft (repro- duced here), which has only been glanc- ingly mentioned in the UFO literature be- fore. Secondly, Kocher's personal investiga- tion is a textbook example of how a UFO case should be investigated — by ufologists and scientists alike. It also demonstrates what we've long known — that when a UFO sighting is investigated thoroughly (and objectively), a phenomenon that es- capes ready identification is sometimes at its core. Having been in the Fortean and UFO fields as long as I have, I have to admit that it's not often that a new name or treatment comes along that really knocks my socks off. It's not that I'm jaded, so much that a completely new way of looking at things just doesn't come along every day. There's much talk of earthshaking paradigms, but most examples of same turn out to be more talk and speculation than true intellectual and scientific earthquake. Not so our con- cluding article this time, \"Cosmic Dancers on History's Stage? The Permanent Revolution in the Earth Sciences.\" I can't tell you much about the author because we haven't been able to get in touch with him. Indeed, if Martin Kottmeyer hadn't drawn our attention to the issue of the New Left Review, an English political journal, in which it first appeared, the article would probably still be unknown to the anomalies community. I can't think of another single piece of this length that I've read within the last decade lhat so opened my eyes to a com- pletely new way of seeing things, in this case the solar system in its entirety and. by extension, the universe itself. \"Cosmic Dancers\" is almost impossible to summa- rize. If 1 had to try, I would say that it takes Gaia theory, which looks at the Earth as a living system, and basically applies the same principles to the solar system as a whole. Other ideas and observations orbit around this central thesis like planets and their satellites around the sun, attracted by the latter's sheer audacity and gravity. What \"purpose\" does Jupiter serve? Why is each planetary and satellite subsystem unique? Are catastrophic impacts \"necessary\" to evolution — and do they follow regular pat- terns or cycles? You'll never be able to look upon life on this planet with quite the same closed (or temporal) perspective as before. Single and back issues of The Anomalisi can be ordered directly from me.

Rounding a bend, one of the two friends pointed ahead and to the right, saying: \"That's mighty slow for an air- plane.\" The others looked and saw three ro- tating red lights just above the trees, forming a large, triangular shape which was moving at a diagonal in their direction. The driver slowed the car to 50 miles-per- hour and watched the object slowly cross over the highway no more than 150 feet in front of them. The speed was too slow, less than two miles-per-hour! They rolled down the windows, but except for the breeze, they could hear nothing. \"How can anything that huge make no noise? How can it navigate . . . only a few feet above the treetops?\" they asked themselves. It was clear to them what they sighted was not three helicopters in for- mation. The lights were on a flat, perfectly level - dark - bottom of the object, and there were no white lights as would be required on helicopters. The driver claims he has seen \"every sort of aircraft from the B-l to the Goodyear blimp. I can assure you that this object would cover more than one-half a football field.\" This witness is a former pi- lot.

Thompson Driving south on 1-85 on a clear night, en route to a restaurant by Whitestone Road, a young male noticed a full moon, but it seemed to be dimming and brightening. At the Waffle House, he had a better view of the not-quite-round light, and he watched it for over three minutes. The glowing, white apparition appeared to be about 100 yards away and 200 feet above ground, pulsating and stationary. He figured it had to be about 30 feet in diameter, since it had an apparent size of a silver dollar at arm's -length. When the light was at its brightest, he could barely look at it without hurting his eyes. He heard no sound from it. When the light was at its dimmest, the witness could make out a smaller, bell- shape, yellow-brown object behind it. This second object was slightly angled from the vertical, and the light around its edge was brighter than in the middle. He told no one inside the restaurant about the unusual phenomena, and when he came back out 45 minutes later, the objects were gone. The State Director - Field Investigator's later contact with the night manager of the Waffle House resulted in learning that no one had reported the objects that evening, but the manager was not sur- prised to learn of this sighting. His patrons often come in claiming they have seen a UFO in the general area. LOG # 9610275C: CE-1, 09/15/96, Waverly, I A, at 20:50 hours CDT, 01:50 GMT, for 30 minutes.

At several thousand feet, the light began a descending spiral in a wide arc toward the west, over a corn field, until, about a minute later, it was at an altitude conventional for helicopters. It took a hovering position near the Red Fox Inn about a quarter of a mile away, and its color changed to red and white. The three decided to go to a local conve- nience store, and when they got in the car, the visitor was still hovering near the Inn. As they left, the object moved in another wide circle, but to the northeast and became paral- lel to their car by the time they reached a stop sign three blocks away. They continued toward town and watched the glowing craft to the side and behind them turn white as they approached town. When they stopped at"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL a stoplight, the object stopped. When they moved forward, it moved forward, keeping pace with them at a distance of less than 50 feet behind and 20 feet above. Before they reached the store, their travelling partner had disappeared. No one had seen it leave. They stopped at the store, but none of them had the nerve to leave the car. Instead, they decided to return to the apartment by another route, and they arrived home with- out incident. After becoming settled, they went outside to again look. \"There it is again!\" the daugh- ter shouted. From the northeastward direc- tion an object came that first \"looked like a big old streetlight\" — straight toward them, dropping in altitude as it approached. The mother ran inside to telephone the police. She was not outside when the object came over their apartment and began hover- ing with, both her daughters and three neigh- bor children watching. The object was glow- ing white all over and additionally had two steady, large white lights at the bottom — al- most like eyes — and one blinking white light at the top. For about five minutes, the round or oval house-size object loomed 20 to 30 feet over the two-story apartment building. Then, with the woman's older daughter watching, the object vanished (blinked out). The police ar- rived a few minutes later.

A tractor trailer was already parked there, which was of no consequence, but to the right of it was something that made the dri- ver speed up and pass on by as fast as he could. What the witness saw was a large object hovering less than 500 feet from the tractor trailer. The driver was probably asleep in- side, unaware that a conical-shaped object was only a short distance away just behind the tops of brush and small trees - exploring the truck with a bright beam of white light at its top, or apex. Green lights ran down two visible sides of the object, giving it the ap- pearance of a Christmas tree.

It was larger than their house, and boomerang or \"U\"-shaped, with several rectangular \"windows\" at the curv- ing areas on its bottom surface. \"I did not want to move,\" the wife said. \"When I did look out, the light was so bright it hurt my eyes to look at it.\" She saw a small \"airplane\" to the left side of the object that appeared to merge into the boomerang. The two continued to watch until the ob- ject looked like just another star in the sky. While watching, they noticed that their two dogs had hidden and were silent.

[that] looked like the color of burn- ing fire. \"What was that?\" she asked herself, looking again as she was reaching a stop light. She could see a cluster of lights between the trees, and she headed in that direction. Making a turn at a stop sign, she saw mov- ing lights in the sky and followed until she was underneath them. Stopping at a stop sign, she could see three lines of green lights forming a triangle and a white light at each corner. Smaller white lights were along the sides, and a red light was on one side. The color of the object's surface was brownish gray. The brightness of the lights tended to hide black circles on the bottom, which the witness believed may have been windows.

When the witness left the stop sign, she saw that the object was out of view. She did not look back until she was home. The investigator found that there had been a number of military helicopters flying low that evening, and it is possible that this witness found one of them. The witness claims, however, that she could hear no noise from the craft. LOG # 970501E: CE-1, 06/07/96, Franklin, GA, at 19:45 hours EOT, 23:45 GMT, for 25 minutes, lndex-25% Investigator: John C. Thompson A man, his girlfriend, and the girlfriend's daughter were boating on the Chattahoo- chee River in the early evening. When they were near the Highway 27 bridge, the daughter yelled at the other two. They turned around to see a silver, egg-shaped ob- ject the size of a VW \"Beetle\" sitting verti- cal, like \"a goose egg,\" about 50 feet over the river and 100 yards away. The water be- neath was undisturbed. They stopped their motor and watched as the object slowly rolled over to a horizontal position then turned 90 degrees clockwise at its center and began slowly moving eastward across the river bank and upward over the hill, toward Franklin. Moving only about ten miles-per-hour, it cleared a kudzu patch be- side a pecan tree and narrowly missed a house. The three noticed several men laying sod on the bank overflown by the object, but none of the men looked up to notice the craft overhead. After passing over Franklin, the object moved high in the sky. changed to a south- west heading back toward the witnesses, and continued in that direction until it was out of sight. During the sighting, both small civilian and high-flying military and commercial planes were seen in the vicinity, but the FAA in Atlanta claimed no pilot reported any- thing unusual.

Thompson Taking a lunch break alone at a park on West Point Lake and enjoying her meal for about 20 minutes, a lady looked northwest- ward toward the lake to see a \"dead gray\" object no more than 20 feet over its surface and about 150 yards away. (She compared its color to the inside of a Teflon® coated, silverstone pot.) The object was shaped like a classical disc the size of a compact car, in- cluding a smoothly integrated dome on its top and a depression on its bottom, all seam- less. A few seconds later, the disc hurled itself straight upward \"at a speed at least as fast as lightning.\" LOG # 970408E: CE-1, 04/08/96, Thomasville, NC, at 21:15 hours EOT, 01:15 GMT, for 30 minutes. Index= 42% Investigator: Robert Hair On a dark night, a man was alone in his pickup truck on a delivery errand for his mother. Driving westward on Emanuel Church Road, and going partly up the hill with the graveyard and church to his right, he saw an object hovering about 30 feet off the ground in an empty field across the road. He was alone on the road. Curious but hesi- tant, the witness drove past the sighting, turned, and drove past again, until he was passing it the fourth time. A light blue-green, conical beam, starting at nearly a point on the edge of the disc- shape and expanding to about three feet in diameter, was being projected to and scan- ning the ground, but the witness could not see anything illuminated on the ground. A circle of numerous brilliant red lights - so bright they obscured viewing the upper part of the object - rimmed its bottom. Inside the circle were what looked like a cluster of four rocket engines, shaped like those of the space shuttle. A red glow could be seen within them, but no flames were being emitted. On the witness' fourth pass-by, the object shut down its scanning beam and slowly moved toward and above him. When directly overhead, the object was within ten feet of his truck, and the \"rocket\" engines - still glowing red - made no sound. After crossing overhead, the vehicle began gaining altitude and continued on a northward course. The witness then saw a very bright white head- light on the craft, shaped like an upright rec- tangle. Fifteen minutes later, after the witness re- sumed his journey, he could still see the ob- ject at a high angle and very far away, recog- nizing it by its rectangular light. \"That's the last I saw of it,\" he concluded."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL IheJSllGHT,SKY Walter N.Webb December 1997 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): During the first week of December, the five naked-eye plan- ets continue to be seen simultaneously during early twilight not far from their positions in November's Night Sky column. Mercury, however, is very low in the SW and difficult to see. (Look early after sunset with binoculars.) Venus (magnitude -4.7) and Mars (1.2) are in the SW at dusk, setting within about 20 minutes of each other around 7 PM. The first planet achieves its maximum brightness on December 11. Venus is near the lunar crescent on the 2nd, 3rd, and 31st and is about 1° above Mars on the 22nd. Jupiter (-2.1), in Capricornus, stands low in the SW at dusk and then sets about 8:30 in mid-month. Saturn (0.7), in Pisces, can be seen in the SE at twilight and advances westward during the evening. While it is very near the gibbous Moon on the night of December 8-9 for most of the U.S., observers in the Southwest can watch the Moon occult the ringed planet for up to an hour starting at about 12:30 AM MST (on the 9th) and about 11:20 PM PST (on the 8th). Saturn resumes apparent direct or eastward motion on the 17th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Saturn sets in the W soon after 1 AM in mid-December. Meteor Shower: Unfortunately for the Geminid meteor peak this year, the full moon hampers viewing of the shower all night on December 13-14. This will severely curtail the usual maxi- mum count of about 50-100 per hour. Lesser numbers of these bright white meteors can be glimpsed from about the 7th to the 15th. € O Moon Phases: First quarter—December 7 Full moon—December 13 Last quarter—December 21 New moon—December 29 The Stars: During the mid-evening hours the resplendent constellations of winter in the SE assume more importance as the dimmer autumn stars flee toward the western horizon. Once Orion the Hunter is found, his trio of belt stars in a row points down- ward toward Sirius, the brightest star in the entire night sky. The belt stars point upward to Aldebaran, the fiery orange eye of Taurus the Bull. Note the V-shaped Hyades star cluster out- lining the bull's face and the dipper-shaped Pleiades cluster marking a spear-wound in the animal's shoulder. On the night of December 12-13, the full moon crosses in front of Aldebaran, hiding it for up to an hour and a quarter (depending upon one's location). This occultation begins about 12:20 AM (on the 13th) in New England, about 10:50 PM (on the 12th) in Chicago, and about 7:50 PM in Los Angeles. The Big Dipper has started its ascent back up the northern sky. The end of its handle rests on the horizon at 9 PM in mid- month (mid-northern latitudes).

Schuessler, MS ABSTRACT On occasion, unidentified flying object (UFO) re- ports contain information about humans feeling a variety of physiological effects during a UFO close encounter or an abduction event. These effects range in intensity from temporary sensations to lasting bodily injuries. Unfortunately, UFO investigators are usually not ade- quately prepared to handle cases of this type. INTRODUCTION For the past fifty years people have been reporting their UFO experiences. In a small percentage of the cases the witnesses also report how they were physically affected by the nearness of the UFO. At the same time, they tell how the UFO behaved in a fashion unlike any- thing manufactured by humans at the time of the inci- dent, how it flew in a bizarre manner, affected plant and animal life, and disabled mechanical and electrical devices. And during the past 30 years, a new category of UFO incident, the abduction experience, has also added to the number of cases involving human physiological effects. The following sampling of such cases will serve to illustrate the worldwide nature of the problem in general. PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS UFO CLOSE ENCOUNTERS TEMPORARY SENSATIONS People report a variety of simple short-lived sensations during UFO incidents. For example: • On September 20, 1972, a driver spotted a UFO as it . landed on Mount Rouge, in the providence of Quebec, Canada. He drove to the mountain and ap- proached the UFO, flashing his car lights. The UFO arose and flew straight at his car, passing about thirty feet above it. He said the object was shaped like a disk and was 100-150 feet in diameter. The car's engine, lights and radio failed during the time the UFO was overhead. The man said he felt a strong sensation of heat during the experience. • On September 24, 1974, a driver encountered a blue fluorescent-like light as it climbed into the sky near Eggardon Hill, England. The light was the shape of a circular neon light with blurred edges. The car's headlights dimmed momentarily while in close prox- imity to the unusual light. At the same time the dri- ver had a \"cold\" feeling. Within 15 seconds the ob- ject had zig-zagged out of sight. The car functioned November 1997 Number 355 Page 20 normally after the light was gone and the cold sen- sation had passed. • On November 26, 1976, a man and woman were driving near Tyler, Texas, when they encountered a gray, triangular-shaped object with a bright white light. As the object neared their truck, two white lights on it started blinking. Immediately, the couple felt as if they were in shock. They said they were \"white\" and shaken. The only lasting effect from the event was a malfunction of their wristwatches. Both lost time. • On August 12, 1981, a man was in a field with his wife near Anderson, Indiana, to photograph a me- teor shower when a strange light came down from above. He said his head and shoulders felt like he had been hit with a wet blanket. It was a very un- comfortable feeling and he was unable to move. After the light retracted, he was able to move again. • During a UFO incident near Barnsley, Yorks, England on August 15, 1986 a man was hit by a blinding white fluorescent beam of light. He fell a tingling sensation and could not move. The hairs on his neck stood on end. He was fine following the in- cident. MULTIPLE EFFECTS Slightly more puzzling are the cases where witnesses re- port multiple sensations during close encounters, as fol- lows: • On November 10, 1957, near Madison, Ohio, a man watched a bright hovering acom-shaped object for 20-30 minutes. During the event he experienced an uncontrollable movement of his hand as it kept go- ing up in front of his face. He suffered from eye ir- ritation for two weeks after the event. • On April 28, 1966, two men were sleeping in their van near Sawtry, England. They awoke suddenly as they experienced difficulty in breathing and had an acidic taste in their mouths. They could hear birds screeching wildly. When they looked outside, they saw two large spherical objects moving away. • On March 6, 1969, near Glenwood, Missouri, a woman drove her car into a beam of light coming down from a UFO hovering about fifty feet above the road. The car slowed and wouldn't respond to Continued on Page 23"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL UFOs 1947-1997: SO YEARS OF FLYING SAUCERS Edited by Dennis Stacy & Hilary Evans, published by Fonean Times. 30 contributors, hb, illus., 272 pp. $27.95 plus $3.00 s/h.

At the same time her dog acted strange and tried to hide under the seat. Her eyes bothered her for three days after the event. • On August 27, 1979, a police officer on patrol in Marshall County, Minnesota, spotted a light over the road. At first he thought it was a low-flying air- craft. Suddenly, the light rushed his car and dam- aged it. The last thing he remembered before losing consciousness was the breaking of glass. About 40 minutes later he regained consciousness and ra- dioed for help. The car was damaged and in the ditch, with the red engine light on. His eyes hurt so much he could barely see. • On September 10, 1981, a young woman was walk- ing up the steps of her parent's home in Weston Mill Hill, England, when she saw a massive craft with pink, purple, and white lights. The shell of the craft was metallic gray. As she reached for the door a lime green beam came down and hit her hand. She was frozen in place - paralyzed. When the beam re- tracted she could move again. After the event she had a mark appear on her hand where the beam hit. • On December 24, 1989, a pilot was flying an L-29 jet aircraft over Chelyabinsk, Siberia when he en- countered a dark gray, cigar-shaped object. He first spotted the object about 500 meters below his plane and maneuvered around to see it better. The total time of the sighting was eight minutes and twenty seconds. He was looking at the object through the transparent canopy for about four minutes. After he landed he noticed that his face was becoming coated with a red crust of soft skin that felt sensitive to the touch. Within a day, the skin thickened into a soft crust-like material that covered the parts of his face not covered by his flying helmet. • On February 4, 1990, a woman driving home from work to Manorville, Long Island encountered a large luminous oval-shaped object. It was flying at treetop level and pacing her car. The light emitted from the object was so bright that she had to squint to be able to see the road. She could feel the heat from the object through the windshield of her car. The object was silent and its surface appeared to be smooth.   y John F.
