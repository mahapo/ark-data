I don't say its survival, because it's almost a given that ufology, although not necessarily in a recognizable form, will almost assuredly survive and continue to thrive until at least the end of the decade or the coming of the new millennium. In the interval we can look for UFOs to become an increasingly popular topic of discussion and attraction among the public at large. In other words, the membership of MUFON and similar organizations will inevitably con- tinue to grow, as will the number of newsletters, books, videos, TV documentaries, movies and annual conferences devoted to UFOs. Clearly, the idea that \"aliens are here\" is one whose time has come, even more so than in the first troubled decades that followed the fall of Hitler and led to the Cold War. This is both a Good and Bad Thing. LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER W hether a commensurate leap in the science of UFOs will accompany this uneasy march into the future remains a matter of some dispute. Orthodox science and ufology have almost always been at odds anyway. On the one hand, we long for and demand sci- entific acceptance, or at least we say we do: on the other hand, we remain suspicious of science as such; in- deed, many of us see science, or at least what we think of as science, as being part of the \"problem.\" At best sci- ence is perceived as merely ignorant or deluded when it comes to the UFO evidence; at worst, it is widely re- garded as the third silent partner, actively linked in in- trigue with the military and other nefarious government intelligent agencies in an ongoing attempt to cover-up the existence of the UFO phenomenon. This is partly our own problem, mainly because so many of us believe—on little more than anecdotal \"ev- idence,\" i.e., faith—in so many things that science finds either inherently repellent or ridiculous. It has to be re- iterated that science does not find the idea ludicrous, on its face, that we share a physical universe with other in- telligent life forms. Nor do all scientists necessarily ob- ject to the idea that we may have been visited on occa- sion by an alien intelligence, the late James McDonald being a prime example. In fact, orthodox science has its own program, or at least it did until recently, called SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, which was designed to scan the heavens for the existence of intelligent (electro- magnetic) signals. But in the main we tended to ridicule this effort much as science ridiculed our own efforts, simply because we \"knew\" better. Why look out there for aliens, we asked, when evidence of their presence is all around us? Certainly we didn't make ourselves out to be especially vocal friends and supporters of SETI, did we? Why not? What did we conceivably have to lose if SETI had turned up intelligent radio signals emanating from, say, the Pleiades or Zeti Reticulum? Absolutely nothing. Yet instead of behaving as if SETI were a potential ally, however reluctant a one, we acted like a bunch of spoiled children on a playground that suddenly wasn't big enough for the both of us. The Crips (or some other neighborhood gang) were trying to steal our thunder! Weren't we here first? Well, we did what we could under the circumstances—we took our ball and went home. If you won't play with us, we won't play with you. However immature we may think science as a whole is, its alleged naivete and intransigence are only matched by our own. Our public relations problem is apt to assume an even greater magnitude with the approach of what we in the West refer to as the Millennium. Never mind that ET can't be expected to keep time according to the Gregorian Calendar, neither do our contemporary coun- terparts in China or the Middle East. Yet such niceties haven't prevented a sort of apocalyptic and chauvinistic mind-set from setting in among Western ufologists, most of who seem blithely unaware of the fact that, in- ternationally, the typical abduction scenario involving cosmic rape and hybrid babies is widely regarded as generic an American export as Big Macs and NFL foot- ball. There is a second window of opportunity open, but I doubt that ufology as a whole will take much better ad- vantage of this one than it did of SETI. It's called the Project on Government and Secrecy of the American Federation of Scientists, and it's chaired by electrical en- gineer Steven Aftergood, who sees governmental se- crecy, on principle, as detrimental to both democracy and science. In other words, it's something that ufology as a whole could stand behind if we don't let our more obsessive beliefs—and our tendency to preach—get in the way. We might find that we have more friends in sci- ence than we think we do. More about the Project on Government and Secrecy and the future of ufology next time. NOVEMBER 1993 NUMBER 307 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ELECTRONIC HARASSMENT & ALIEN ABDUCTIONS Claims that terrestrial technology has caught up with the UFO continue to proliferate By Ann B. Livingston O n the morning of December 29, 1992 at 7:15 AM, the full interior of our ground floor, 2- bedroom apartment was illuminated suddenly by a silver/white flash of unknown origin. Exactly 10 hours later, as I arrived home from my bookkeeping job with an electronic banking/ATM network, I was ac- costed in the parking lot by 5 male pedestrians who ap- peared faceless and carried hand-held devices resem- bling long black flashlights. One of them spoke to me in a mechanical, computerized voice. Only seconds after I parked my car, a blinding headache rendered me semi- conscious. A peculiar \"amnesia\" caused me to forget these strangers until 3 days later. Due to my status as a presumed abductee, I decided this must have been an MIB visitation. However, in early September, Editor Filip Coppens of VFA Newsletter (Belgium) wrote and suggested that I contact Julianne McKinney, Director of the Electronic Surveillance Project of the Association of National Security Alumni, in Silver Spring, MD. According to Filip, the events of December 29th were classic exam- ples of U.S. Government-sponsored electronic harass- ment conducted against involuntary, private citizens, which Mrs. McKinney asserts is taking place. McKinney describes herself as ex-Army Intelligence, who became a victim of electronic harassment, along with her daugh- ter, when she actively rebelled against her superior of- ficers. On September 25, 1993, Mrs. McKinney replied to my inquiry with a 4-page letter to me, a copy of her August 16th letter to Filip Coppens, and a booklet titled Microwave Harassment & Mind-Control Experimentation (December, 1992), which Filip says is now dated. Nonetheless, McKinney's booklet does summarize, to a certain extent, the types of weapons used (characterized as \"nonlethal\"), the most frequent forms of overt and covert harassment activities, and the agencies or departments which are most heavily in- volved. I was disappointed, because I was looking for more specific data, such as a chart or matrix indicating types of weapons, names of manufacturers, physical, mental and emotional side effects induced by each, and the re- spective agencies or departments in charge. Filip said McKinney sent him a catalog of these and similar weapons, all evidently available to individual mail order customers. Some of the harassment activities listed in McKinney's booklet closely resemble things that also happen to CE IV experiencers and UFO investigators, such as mail tampering, phone service disruptions, elec- tronic eavesdropping, menacing drivers and passengers in so-called \"look alike\" cars with modified license plates, nosebleeds, and hearing voices and/or highly ir- ritating sounds such as a hum, pinging or continuous- pitch noise. We already know that the CIA's Project MKULTRA, mentioned in McKinney's booklet, was responsible for the invention and manufacture of LSD,* as well as the now famous mind-control experiments at an Ottawa, Canada psychiatric hospital. Recently, when hundreds of New Mexico residents complained of a mysterious hum that was robbing them of sleep and driving them nearly crazy, a local Congressman accused the Defense Department of conducting secret experiments and a coverup. Clearly, the U.S. Government has been involved to some extent in mind control/electronic harassment test- ing and experimentation. But to what degree? Are pri- vate citizens being targeted at random, and in large numbers? Or, is McKinney talking about only a few, iso- lated cases? M cKinney's booklet, and her letters to Filip Coppens and myself, left me with more questions than answers. Since I cannot personally vouch for the ac- curacy of McKinney's allegations, and since her letters were rife with so many glaring inconsistencies and neg- ative statements bordering on libel in reference to certain UFOlogists whom she named, I shall merely report on what happened. First, McKinney turned down my request for help, stating that the UFO factor presents \"complications\" which she is not prepared to address at this time. However, in her letter to Filip Coppens, in which she summarized some of the 12 cases she has investigated to date, three started out with McKinney as presumed ab- ductees. *editor's note—According to Acid Dreams by Martin Lee and Bruce Shlain (Evergreen, 1985), lysergic acid diethy- lamide (LSD-25) was first synthesized in 1938 by Dr. Albert Hofmann, a chemist employed with the Swiss firm of Sandoz. His first LSD \"trip,\" however, did not occur until April 16, 1943. According to John Marks (The Search for the \"Manchurian Candidate,\" Norton, 1979), the CIA probably first approached Sandoz sometime in 1951, seek- ing to buy up the world's supply. LSD and other hallucino- genic drugs were definitely employed in the MKULTRA project. The Nazis had experimented with mescaline at Dachau, during WWII. PAGE 4 NUMBER 307 NOVEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL McKinney mentions that directed-energy devices such as laser weapons, isotropic radi- ators, infrasound, non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse generators and high-power microwave emitters, were displayed at a 1992 Depart- ment of Army Symposium titled \"The Soldier as a System.\" Second, McKinney stated in her letter to me that she has seen no evidence so far of UFO reality. She refers to it instead as the \"UFO myth,\" which she says was cre- ated by the U.S. Government to conceal the true nature and scope of its directed-energy, nonlethal weapons testing. McKinney believes that MUFON and similar or- ganizations are nothing more than a \"con\" established to perpetuate and reinforce the alleged \"UFO myth.\" In her booklet, McKinney mentions that directed en- ergy devices such as laser weapons, isotropic radiators, infrasound, non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse genera- tors and high-power microwave emitters, were dis- played at a 1992 Department of Army Symposium titled \"The Soldier as a System,\" along with a printed handout listing 42 civilian R&D facilities under contract for the manufacture and testing of these weapons. In all three Alien films, 'The Soldier as a System\" was discussed by the actors relative to directed-energy weapons. Does this bit of information mean that McKinney's use of the phrase could be as fictitious as the movies? Several retired Air Force and Army officers of my ac- quaintance told me that \"The Soldier as a System\" does exist, but is used primarily to mold raw recruits into su- perhuman, amoral killing machines. None of the officers believed the government would want to bother with testing their directed-energy weapons on civilians —ex- cept, perhaps, in rare cases. As one retiree put it, \"they\" can call you in and tell you that they are giving you a flu shot. But, in reality, you don't know what chemicals are actually being injected into your body. H ow do we assess the veracity of McKinney's allegations? To even begin that process, we need to first look beyond McKinney's sleek, professional appearing monograph. Fortunately, the two letters I received along with McKinney's booklet allowed me a quick glimpse at the person behind the name. What I found was disappointing, to say the least. Although McKinney turned down my case, she had plenty to say about it anyway. According to Filip Coppens, she is quick to jump to unfounded conclusions. I found this to be an understatement at best. McKinney says I was allegedly \"conditioned\" on purpose to believe that I am a legitimate UFO abductee. She asserts without hesitation that the medical and psy- chological testing I underwent last year in Cincinnati, with Len Stringfield and his team of medical and psy- chiatric volunteers, was done merely to establish that I could be trusted to uphold the \"UFO myth.\" As McKinney sums up: \"With all due respect, Mrs. Livingston, I do believe that you have been suckered big time.\" The question is: by whom? McKinney refused to take on my case, yet stated to me that she has no doubts of my being a victim of elec- tronic harassment. If so. then why does she resist the op- portunity to prove it? Is McKinney making a wild as- sertion, pulled out of thin air, based on nothing but her own imagination? Or, does she have something more substantial to go by: a bit of intelligence about me, per- haps gained via illegal or illicit means? To further reinforce the ominous nature of her re- marks, McKinney goes on to say, \"What I see in your letter is that you are a balanced, objective, intelligent and articulate woman, with an innate sense of skepticism which has to be watched, if your long-term control is to be assured.\" What does McKinney intend here: to con- vey a backhanded compliment? Or, to issue a not so sub- tle warning? I n her letter to Filip Coppens, McKinney bemoans the fact that E.T. and similar films portrayed the U.S. Government as \"ruthlessly trampling upon the rights of anyone believed to have some connection to UFOs.\" Pardon my French, but, in reality, this is illogical bull droppings. Yet the Electronic Surveillance Project, if established to address factual events, itself serves as a living testi- monial to the fact that the U.S. Government is far worse than any villain conjured up by Hollywood! Regarding the incident of December 29th, McKinney offered 2 hypothetical explanations to Filip Coppens. To the best of my somewhat limited technical knowledge, neither is feasible or predicated on fact. Nonetheless, I shall review them here so as to round out the character and feel of McKinney's inconsistent posturing. Both hypotheses were suggested by McKinney as possible causes for the anomalous flash of light inside my apartment. First, however, readers should note that it was broad daylight at the time. A severely dense fog blanketed the ground. Thick clouds extended upward to 30,000 feet, with zero visibility. Commercial jet air- craft taking off from O'Hare International Airport's northwest runway, situated about 4 miles from my apart- ment, were ascending directly overhead at 30 second in- tervals; it was morning rush hour. The planes, while flying overhead, were not visible behind the clouds. Neither were their strobe headlights. Presumably, all aircraft were flying on instrumentation due to prevailing weather conditions. Mrs. McKinney suggested to Filip Coppens that a low-orbit directed-energy satellite of the SD1 variety might have been testing the deflection of moonlight from its reflector mirrors on the morning in question. An NOVEMBER 1993 NUMBER 307 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, IL told me by phone on October 1st that moonlight cannot penetrate the atmosphere in the form of a concentrated energy beam. For additional satellite information, I phoned the Goddard Space Flight Center, but to date my calls have not been returned. McKinney's second theory was just plain ludicrous. According to McKinney, someone at O'Hare Airport might have been trying to \"prank\" me by shining a giant searchlight in the direction of my apartment building. That searchlight would have to come from the south/southeast. My apartment windows all face due west. On a south/southeast line between the airport and my apartment are several high rise structures, including industrial tank farms and the IH-90 overpass on Elmhurst Road. No searchlight beam, if shone along the ground, could reach my apartment intact, or access my windows from the necessary direction. Nor is it likely that anyone would risk the safety of passengers, flight crews, and persons on the ground to either conduct a satellite \"test\" so close to a busy airport, or to carry out a \"prank.\" M cKinney has acquitted herself as intellectually disorganized. Perhaps it is all a ruse, designed to \"muddy the waters,\" so to speak. Then again, perhaps the woman's every word is calculated for maximum theatrical effect. Does this mean that the Electronic Surveillance Project is worthless, or unworthy of further investigation? Absolutely not. If we can bypass Ms. McKinney and her ceaseless posturing, we may find that the Project can be- come a new and invaluable resource. We owe it to our- selves to try and establish the U.S. Government's al- leged clandestine influences upon the UFO subculture. We do not have to accept Mrs. McKinney's hypoth- esis that UFOs are non-existent and thus not responsible for any of the events normally associated with the CE-IV experience. On the other hand, if there is a more terres- trial explanation for some aspects of the typical abduc- tion scenario, then we deserve to be informed accord- ingly. Two recent books contain narratives of concurrent alien and U. S. Government harassment: Into the Fringe and Lost is the Key. Also of timely concern in this regard is the \"Linda Cortile\" case. The next logical question would be as follows: If electronic harassment is real what can be done about it? Julianne McKinney alludes to countermeasures that she was able to implement during some of her investiga- tions. However, she never talks specifics. In her booklet, McKinney cites a white paper published in 1991 by the U. S. Global Strategy Council, which strongly advocates the speedy development of countermeasures to non- lethal, directed-energy weapons. McKinney also reports that she has requested inter- vention from the FBI, the ACLU, Amnesty International, and various judges and U.S. Senators, all without success. While McKinney cites apathy and in- competence as reasons why the respective agencies and officials have refused to help, I am left wondering if the fault lies with them or with her. Personally, I would feel better if McKinney were to supply names of the judges and U.S. Senators in question. Since these indi- viduals have presumably refused to help, I don't see that publicizing their names would cause any harm. I n other areas, McKinney does not hesitate to do just that. No doubt to reinforce her assertion that we are all victims of a grandiose, \"UFO myth,\" McKinney ac- cuses Budd Hopkins and Dr. John Mack of trying to achieve \"guru status\" with UFO abductees, and sug- gests that someone ought to look into their income sources, both private and governmental, in the event that either, or both, are operating in accordance with a hidden agenda. McKinney writes to Filip Coppens, \"I frankly see little difference between what Hopkins and Mack are do- ing and what such evangelists as Jimmy Swaggart, and Jim and Tammy Baker have done.\" In closing, McKinney says, \"So far, nothing which has been discussed with me has led me to believe that UFOs are anything other than government contrivances. It is what in the vernacular is known as a 'con.'\" No doubt McKinney believes she is clever and logi- cal as she delivers these cliche-ridden insights into her deeply disorganized intellect. However, it must be kept in mind that she is, by her own admission, a trained in- telligence officer. Which raises the question of whether Mrs. McKinney is attempting to play us for fools, as ev- idenced by the fundraising solicitation which accompa- nied her booklets, letters and insults. The anomalous flash of light inside my apartment on December 29th remains unexplained, as do many details of Julianne McKinney's allegations, background, and current status relative to the U.S. Government. If the scope and severity of involuntary directed-energy testing on civilians is as widespread as McKinney implies, then why haven't we been hearing more about it? And—if McKinney's claims are indeed factual, why do her presumed enemies within the U.S. Government allow her to live—and to continue with this program?

By Victoria Alexander T he argument can be made that the UFO abduction research community has essentially exchanged what should be its primary active goal—the dis- covery of physical evidence—in favor of the far more passive one of merely listening to and collecting endless anecdotal accounts of what it means to be abducted. We seem more enthralled by the stories themselves than by the challenge of corroboration. It's almost as if re- searchers and abductees are now trapped in the throes of a love affair gone sour, a bonding that began with the best interests of both parties in mind but which has somehow degenerated into a two-way parasitic rela- tionship, one feeding off the other. There are rumors of jealousy among abductees, of sources and information closely guarded, and accusations of researcher-driven data and destructive hidden agendas—as well as ven- omous character assassination—that have left us rear- ranging the deck chairs while the (space)ship sinks. When the victors survey their dominion, when all new- comers (and critics) are considered pariahs—or worse, agents of \"disinformation\"—will there be anybody left who really cares? I have a proposal that could effectively temper the cutthroat politics of abduction research. It involves a few caveats that should be stated at the outset. First, it puts aside all theories of UFO aliens as denizens of other di- mensions (ultra, intra or extra) or time travelers (back- wards and forwards), and assumes that abductions take place within our conceptual reality: that is, they involve real spacecraft and humanoids operating in real time and space. Secondly, I am one of those few voices cry- ing out in the wilderness of UFO research who opposes the habitual rendering of abductee as victim. 1 am sym- pathetic to the plight of abductees. Alien technology exhibits a powerful control over human subjects, in the face of which we appear defenseless. It goes without saying that fear can immobilize and temporarily shut-off certain mental processes, leaving the abductee little more than a laboratory pawn. At the same time, this is a relatively passive role, too, and I think we have to ask ourselves how can it be made more active? Currently, abduction support groups offer solace and comfort, researchers provide legiti- macy and the UFO community at large presents a plat- form to gain a wider public awareness of the crisis. Yet direction and focus for abductees as a group re- mains unexplored. Even if they are victims, victims routinely assist in the apprehension of criminals. And make no mistake about it, abductions as usually por- trayed represent crimes against humanity. THE ABDUCTEE'S PLIGHT Abductees routinely confront their assailants in isolated circumstances. According to Dr. T. E. Bullard's bril- liant 1987 research', of the 270 published cases he ex- amined, 44% were \"highway hijacks.\" Bedroom ab- ductions accounted for 21% of the total cases. The last category, which Bullard attributed to \"other settings,\" such as capture in the woods while hunting, fishing or camping, comprised a third of all reports. By 1992, the demographics had seemingly changed dramatically. David M. Jacobs, Ph.D. based his book, Secret Life 2 , on approximately sixty individuals. While Jacobs does not actually catalogue the resulting 300 abduction experi- ences that he examined for Secret Life by location, he maintains that the abductors \"seem to make a conscious effort to take people when they will not be missed or when their lives will not be overly disrupted,\" i.e., in the sanctity of one's bedroom at night. Indeed, most of Jacobs' research relies heavily on bedroom abductions, which he considers \"typical,\" adding at the beginning of Chapter 3 that \"This is Not a Dream.\" Based upon the present evaluation of Dr. Jacobs and other leaders in the field of abduction research, we conclude that this expe- rience is real and not a dream. Real people, real be- ings, real events, real evidence. Did we say real evi- dence? After all, we've all heard about the \"inconclu- sive\" pieces of metal sitting on some university labora- tory shelf, the rumored implants 3 and the \"controversial\" MRIs. Nothing, however, that any of us would bet the family farm on. And even this paltry amount of evidence seems pitiable in comparison with the number of alleged ab- ductions. For instance, John E. Mack, M. D., is quoted in the September 1993 issue of Omni Magazine as saying that \"thousands\" of UFO abduction stories have been in- vestigated. The recent Roper Report suggests that mil- lions of abductions may have taken place. If either of these claims can be substantiated, we are forced to con- clude—given the absence of corroborating physical ev- idence on any similar scale—that we're simply not looking hard enough. We have neglected to delve into the physical evidence that should be attendant to a phys- ical abduction. A \"real event\" should produce \"real ev- idence.\" We need first then to to look at the typical abductee's bedroom as the scene of an actual crime—a repository of potential physical evidence—in the same way that a police crime scene unit would. After all, despite ru- mors of alien \"diplomatic immunity,\" crimes by any NOVEMBER 1993 NUMBER 307 PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Obviously, we can't expect an all points bulletin or arrest warrant to be issued regarding a band of rov- ing Greys, but we can, or at least we can attempt to do, what the police would do in similar circum- stances. definition have definitely been committed, including unlawful entry, kidnapping, physical assault and even rape. Obviously, we can't expect an all points bulletin or arrest warrant to be issued regarding a band of roving Greys, but we can, or at least we can attempt to do, what the police would do in similar circumstances. THE ABDUCTEE TASK FORCE (THE ATF) 4 Let us also offer abductees the opportunity to participate in the investigation of their cases using police crime scene protocols. We must respect the capabilities of ab- ductees. The enforced conscription of human males and females into a mysterious alien program must be strate- gically analyzed. Thus far there has been no account- ability. We have the data, we need to take action. Abductees must be able to join in the process of dis- covery with us and contribute to solving the mystery thrust upon us. Abductees can finally take charge of a vital aspect of the abduction experience, which is the necessary next phase of research. We can effect change and alter the aliens' paradigm. Abductees. situated as they are, are clearly in the right place at the right time to take us forward, since, as far as crime scenes go, the bedroom abduction presents a near pristine environment for in- vestigation. Typically, the abductee is alone or with a spouse; frequently he or she is subjected to multiple abductions and can sense their onslaught. These facts alone can aid us in the preparation of future evidence collecting methodology. For example, \"Linda Cortile,\" in the June 1993 MU- FON UFO Journal, writes: \"/ began to feel the familiar sensation of numbness that I'd felt periodically over my lifetime, creeping up slowly from my toes.\" Linda's case is rich with detail that could have yielded us extra- ordinary evidence. Linda states: \"I screamed holy terror and began to cry, because it was there, standing at the foot of my bed, staring at me!\" She attempted to fight off the abduction. \"I pulled up a large pillow from behind me and threw it. I hit him too! \" Later, through hypnosis, Linda explains leaving the bedroom and going into her livingroom. She writes: \"One being walked in front of me.\" Imagine the evidence a crime scene unit could have collected! In these four short statements Linda provides us with the means to explore this event in the bright light of real evidence! \"That thing,\" as Linda de- scribes \"him,\" was standing at the foot of her bed. The being's \"foot\" made contact with the bedroom floor. She hit him with a pillow. The pillow made contact with \"him.\" •These statements are particularly significant in light of what might be called the first rule of thumb of foren- sic, or criminal, medicine, namely that when any two items come in contact with one another there will be an inevitable exchange of microscopic or larger particles. In other words, we don't necessarily need to wait for the confirmation of such passive \"evidence\" as implants and \"missing fetuses,\" we can actively pursue our own investigations in the meantime. Accordingly, an Abductee Task Force (ATF) should be organized and guidelines established for the collec- tion of materials. Abductee Crime Scene Unit protocols should be distributed by researchers. When the Abductee Crime Scene Unit work is to begin, the spouse (or other) will be asked to leave the bedroom, touching nothing. Using police jargon, we can \"seal\" the area within hours of the crime. The abductee can now begin collecting \"evidence.\" INITIAL STEPS Many abductees awake consciously remembering what happened to them during the night. Linda Cortile writes that \"A few hours later, I called Budd [Hopkins] to make arrangements with him to discuss what hap- pened. \" Had she followed police crime scene procedures and collected samples, we might be a step closer to un- derstanding the phenomenon and validating her claims. Abductees could begin by taking a photograph of the bedroom and then drawing a rough sketch of the room, marking entry and discovery points of the \"ab- ductors.\" With a tape measure, measurements of the room and furniture would next be taken. It is essential that the date and time are noted. Each found item must be packaged separately and immediately labeled. Small plastic envelopes with a zipper-like closure will be best. A police rape kit usually contains fine-toothed combs, tapes and vials to collect swabs from the pubic area, vaginal washings and comb- ings. Victims of rape are asked not to bathe until after a medical examination because critical evidence will be washed away. An abductee can collect such \"intrusive\" evidence herself. Any piece of fabric the abductee thinks made contact with the abductors should be carefully marked and sealed in a baggy. There may be some hair, fiber and/or a semen-like substance remaining. In Secret Life, Jacobs describes a typical alien examination as beginning thus: \"The Small Beings lead the abductee to the table, and, if she still has her clothes on, assist her in removing them.

She then gets up on the table and lies down. \" 5 The foregoing passage clearly indicates that: the clothes have been touched by the small beings, perhaps leaving some finger markings; the clothes are left lying on the floor, perhaps coming in contact with spacecraft parti- cles; the abductee lies down on a table, perhaps with traces from the table remaining on her body.

Samples should be collected from every area the abductors may have contacted. EXTRATERRESTRIAL FINGERPRINTS The following surfaces hold fingerprints: aluminum windowscreen frames, paper of all kinds, painted sur- faces, unpainted wooden surfaces, live plants, glass, copper pipe, human skin (maximum twelve hours), gal- vanized metal, automobile bodies and plastic. Abductees describe aliens as having hands and fingers. The fingers are described as thin and long with rounded pads at the ends. They have thumbs. I am not suggesting that ab- ductees resort to dusting, spraying, dipping and fuming for latent prints or purchase fingerprinting kits; however, masking tape could possibly provide the proper adhesive for \"lifting\" a print. Nevertheless, based upon current po- lice crime scene laboratory work, even a piece of cloth- ing, handled by an alien may provide evidence of an alien contact. HUMAN/ALIEN SEX When the human male reproductive cell, the spermato- zoa, joins with the ovum, the human female reproductive cell, the first thing produced is a zygote. The zygote turns into a fetus, which turns into a human being. Each human being is produced by a DNA code that comes half from the mother and half from the father. Many abductees report sex with alien beings. An ab- ductee (and medical doctor) of my acquaintance has related to me essentially the same scenario that Jacobs describes in Secret Life: \"Intercourse takes place with- out much preliminary stimulation. The insertion of the 'penis' is quick, and the penis does not feel normal; it is usually very thin and very short. The normal thrusting movement does not take place, and the woman feels a sudden 'pulse.' Then it is all over. \"\" Since abductees do not report that aliens have genitals, Jacobs' concludes that \"...intercourse may not be taking place with an alien. \" Instead he suggests that \"...the abductee is hav- ing intercourse with offspring, who do have genitals, or aliens are inserting something inside a woman to make her think that intercourse is taking place, or the entire affair is a part of envisioning and no physical event is occurring.\" However, we again reference Jacobs, as follows: This is Not a Dream. The abductee (and med- ical doctor) has confided to me that her numerous sexual episodes with aliens resulted in pregnancies. Due to her medical training, we must conclude that her evalua- tion merits close scrutiny. Physical contact and physical pregnancy occurred. A gain, relying on the most current published information on abductions, Secret Life, we turn to the subject of evidential residues. Several women have reported \"leaking a clear fluid\" or a \"brown sub- NOVEMBER 1993 stance\" between their legs. If there is a hybrid breed- ing program, aliens must be introducing alien sperm into women. As all women will attest, the introduction of any liquid or dissolving substance inside the vagi- na, after a short period of time, will result in a residue of that substance being expelled. Based upon abductee reports, the male half of the zy- gote—alien DNA—must be the agent introduced through intercourse, or an intercourse-like procedure. After alien intercourse, the abductee is quickly dressed and returned home. We can safely reason that the ab- ductee, upon rising minutes or hours later, will have physical evidence of the encounter. Will this evidence dissolve, evaporate or mysteri- ously disappear? If it has a biological and/or chemical base, a signature, the logical assumption is, no. Traces of it will remain and can be stored for analysis. Based upon the presumed millions of abductions taking place yearly, millions of samples are being negligently and carelessly overlooked. Are we prepared to expect ab- ductees to collect specimens? To take action? OUTFOXING THE ALIENS Can abductions be prevented? Jacobs feels that, at best, an abduction can only be postponed, though not indefi- nitely. Jacobs has recommended the use of a video cam- era since aliens appear to require secrecy. Yet, video equipment is expensive and intrusive on a nightly basis, and thus far the aliens have been able to sidestep being filmed. Advancing our theory that we can apply crime deterrent procedures to the abduction mystery, we find a common police recommendation most interesting: thief detection powder. It is almost invisible when dry. It clings to anything and it cannot be brushed off. Any at- tempt to brush it off only spreads it. Also, it cannot be washed off. Water makes everything turn more purple. While I do not suggest that abductees coat their bedroom floors with thief detection powder, why not adapt the concept to our needs and use flour? Thus, we would be able to confirm the vital lynchpin of abductions— alien intrusion through a secured enclosure. We would cer- tainly be able to obtain footprints, since Jacobs' writes: \"They stand and walk like humans.'' 7 Consider that a great deal of information can be gleamed from a shoeprint. No matter how smooth and nondistinctive the soles or the materials used, the shoes will begin to change as they begin to wear. Soil samples or spacecraft particles can be taken from such prints. We would also have fabric impressions or fibers. Can we dismiss the fact that pollen, leaves, fungus and any number of sub- stances can be successfully traced by application of this procedure? FURTHER DETECTION We can also apply police crime scene procedures to the interaction between abductees and their hybrid chil- dren. There is a strong possibility that abductees will NUMBER 307     PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The newly wed Victoria Alexander Is MUFON's State Section Director for Santa Fe.

Abductees' nightwear could offer a wealth of informa- tion since pollens and dust particles from the nursery would also adhere to clothing. There are also many abductees who report encounters with insectoid-like creatures, praying mantis-like crea- tures and reptilian-like creatures. Dave Huggins has had repeated sexual encounters with an alien female for approximately 24 years (1963-1987). This alien fe- male differs from others since she appeared to have head and pubic hair. A praying mantis would watch them have sex. It is absurd that almost nightly visitations (claimed as \"real,\" not \"apparitions\") for approximately 24 years from an insectoid-like creature has not yielded one \"insectoid hair.\" Had Huggins ever even looked around his bedroom for a hair from the \"...head and pu- bic hair which seemed [to him] unnaturally perfect, as if wig-like, and very black in color\"?* I am not doubting Huggins' sincerity. What baffles me is the lack of inter- est of researchers to delve into the possibility—and to confront the issue of—hard evidence actually surfacing in such a case. If we do not regard Huggins (and others like him) as telling the truth, then it is unconscionable that we do not refer Huggins (and others like him) to mental health therapists, as opposed to UFO researchers. GOVERNMENT ABSENTEEISM Many researchers believe the government has been withholding access to the physical evidence regarding UFOs. Abductees are a clear exception. Only rarely do we hear of government agents interrogating UFO ab- ductees. Since there are so many abductees in our midst, this may be our best path to the hard evidence for which everyone is clamoring. We must stop crying for outside help for the answers. Apparently, our government does not care about abductions. So unless our government re- moves abductees—from our community into isolation— we have the participants among us. We are in control of the data. ABDUCTEE ENABLERS I have briefly outlined a strategy for discovery I hope others, more knowledgeable than myself, will cham- pion, explore and pursue. We must be inventive and clever since we continue to be confounded by a mystery that has eluded explanation. Researchers and investiga- tors can guide abductees by the protocols outlined above. But, foremost, they must become Abductee Enablers. Researchers must take abductees to the next level of in- vestigation. As Abductee Enablers, they are in a unique position to affirm the abductees' value and continued contribution to the field. Experiencers can work along- side Enablers. I believe we can alter the Alien impri- matur. This is not a capricious Alien program. We have something they highly regard and an intelligence they are supposedly integrating with their own. Let us use that intelligence wisely. Alternatively, we can, of course, ignore the pleas for more in depth, conscientious research and continue to sit passively around the UFO campfire, listening to scary stories. REFERENCES 1. Thomas E.

By Barry Greenwood C AUS (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy) has re- cently acquired a large assembly of Project Blue Book information not presently included in the National Archives holdings. Central to this are thirty-two rolls of microfilm of the Air Force's 1952 clipping service, a product of the upgrading of Blue Book activities by Captain Edward Ruppelt, former head of the project in 1952. An assortment of other rolls of film and hardcopy relating to Project Sign (a predecessor to Blue Book) and the 1960s Condon Committee round out the holding. We are indebted to Professor Herbert Strentz, a for- mer research associate with the University of Colorado's Condon Committee, for making the infor- mation available. The story behind the acquisition is that sometime during the summer of 1967 Strentz paid a visit to Project Blue Book headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, along with either Condon staffers Norman Levine, Roy Craig or David Saunders (he could not remember which at this late date). During a meeting with Colonel Hector Quintanilla, then head of Blue Book, it was discovered that Blue Book personnel were in the process of house cleaning and throwing out some \"unnecessary material.\" Quintanilla asked the Colorado staffers if they wanted any of it. They asked Strentz, who said yes. since at the time he was engaged in research on UFO press coverage for his doctoral dissertation. This research was eventually published as \"A Survey of Press Coverage of Unidentified Flying Objects, 1947- 1966,\" circa 1970 (Arcturus Books, 1982). Saved from oblivion by Strentz were thirty-two rolls of 35mm film of the April to September 1952 press clipping coverage; two rolls of public letters reacting to the April 7, 1952 Life magazine article, \"Have We Visitors from Outer Space?;\" reels 1,7,8.9 of Project Sign summaries (microfilm produced by the Air Force for circulation to scientists for analysis and comment). These summaries cover cases 172, then 172-237 in the Sign records. They have not been sani- tized as far as we can tell; two rolls titled \"Varied UFO, First Part\" and \"1965 El Toro.\" These rolls appear to have been prepared for the Condon Committee and deal with high-interest cases of the 1950s-60s. The \"El Toro\" reference concerns the famous Rex Heflin photos from Santa Ana, Califor- nia; one roll of what seems to be a newsreel film titled \"Camera Headlines\" by Telenews. The film is a 35mm negative showing what appears to be Air Force offi- cers entering a plane carrying a box. The scene then switches to outside shots while the plane is in flight. Nothing overtly peculiar is visible. After weeding out a few other duplicate rolls, we have about 32,000 pages of 1952 UFO press coverage and 8,000 pages of other records from the early years of UFO history. The material should have been part of the National Archives UFO holdings had it not become separated in 1967. Thanks to Professor Strentz's fore- sight it is preserved for posterity. In his book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (Doubleday, 1956), Captain Edward Ruppelt described the clipping service several times: Pgs.136-7: \"Back in March (1952, Ed.), when it had become apparent that the press was reviving its interest in UFOs, I had suggested that Project Blue Book subscribe to a newspaper clipping service. Such a service could provide several things. First, it would show us exactly how much publicity the UFOs were getting and what was being said, and it would give us the feel of the situation. Then it would also provide a lot of dala for our files. In many cases the newspapers got reports that didn't go to the Air Force. Newspaper reporters rival any intelligence officer when it comes to digging up facts, and there was always the possibil- ity that they would uncover and print something we'd missed. This was especially true in the few cases of hoaxes that always accompany UFO publicity. Last, it would provide us with material on which to base a study of the effect of newspaper publicity upon the number and type of UFO reports. ''Colonel Dunn liked the idea of the clipping ser- vice, and it went into effect soon after the first publici- ty had appeared. Every three or four days we would gel an envelope full of clippings. In March the clip- ping service was sending the clippings to us in letter- sized envelopes. The envelopes were thin — maybe there would be a dozen or so clippings in each one. Then they began to get thicker and thicker, until the people who were doing the clipping switched to using manila envelopes. Then the manila envelopes began to get thicker and thicker. By May we were up to old shoe boxes. The majority of the newspaper stories in the shoe boxes were based on material that had come from ATIC.\" Pg. 139: ''In June the big flap hit—they began to de- liver clippings in big cardboard cartons.\" NOVEMBER 1993 NUMBER 307 PAGE 1 I"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Major Hector Quintanilla, then head of Project Blue Book, was cleaning out the Project's old files. If a young graduate student in journalism hadn't been there, they would have gone into the garbage. They should have gone to the National Archives. T he service was dropped, Ruppelt explained, be- cause Blue Book ran out of room to keep them all. The clipping service then disappeared into history. Because the clips did not shift over to the National Archives with the Blue Book records in 1976, the orig- inals were very likely destroyed, but before that the en- tire lot was transferred to microfilm as early as December 1952. We know this because the microfilm boxes bear a label \"Develop Before December 1952.\" They were kept at Blue Book for the next fifteen years until their release to Strentz. For the record, this is how the boxes were labeled: Government UFO records are not found in large quantities anymore, particularly ones which had be- come separated from the owning agency.

A bonus was included with the microfilm release. Professor Strentz also added another clipping collec- tion, one of a group in the possession of the Condon Committee from a private collection, and used in Strentz's dissertation.

The 63-year-old retired truck driver with experience in the Army went on to describe a cir- cular object with rings of red and pink colors, seen low on the horizon for about a minute on 10 October. 1992. He pointed investigators east-southeast and said it hov- ered below the far mountains, perhaps three miles from his Greenville. VA home. Two and a half miles east- southeast of Greenville, about 7:00 p.m., a father and son (ages 66 and 38) were driving south on Route 666 when the son shouted that he was seeing something high up in the windshield. \"I was amazed by its movement and felt that if it was a plane that it would surely crash\", the fa- ther told MUFON. The pink lighted oval object dropped down from several thousand feet altitude to some 200 feet in front of them, emitting a \"jet's reverse-thrust roar\". After a brief hover, the shape with three hori- zontal, rectangular pink lights or windows on its side, moved east-southeast and downward behind low hills and trees. Expecting a crash or landing, the two drove fast to get to a point of unobstructed vision but saw no more of the object, despite hearing the jet roar in the area for some four minutes longer. • Log #93100IE: A woman began to notice a large bright white light located directly behind a 60-70 foot tall pine tree in the side yard of her Olney.

The light, lo- cated about two thirds of the way up the tree, began to grow larger and brighter, until it was at least 15 feet in diameter. She described the brightness of the light as be- ing comparable to a \"stadium light\". The light then be- gan to decrease in both size and intensity until it dimmed completely out: total observation some 5 or 6 seconds.

This follows on the heels of an earlier controversial seizure of some 85,000 acres in the same area in 1984. The latest land grab, touted as needed \"to ensure the public safety and the safe and secure operation of ac- tivities in the Nellis Air Force Range complex,\" is ob- viously designed to seal off public access to White Sides Mountain and so-called \"Freedom Ridge,\" both of which presently offer almost unobstructed viewing of the ultrasecret Groom Lake runway and flight facilities. It is approximately 15 miles south of here, at Papoose Lake, or Area S-4, that Robert Lazar and others claim the Air Force were reportedly test-flying and reverse-en- gineering captured or otherwise obtained flying saucers. Groom Lake itself is supposed to be home to the ru- mored Mach 5 or higher spy plane known as Aurora. The government denies the existence of either UFOs or Aurora anywhere in the immediate vicinity of Dreamland or any other flight facility. On the other hand, isn't the Cold War supposed to be over? As Campbell points out, the seizure of another 3900 acres couldn't conceivably be aimed at preventing Soviet, French or Chinese spy satellites from peering down at Groom Lake; they could only be targeted at the American tax- payer, who might legitimately be concerned about bil- lion-dollar \"black budget\" programs like Aurora. I also talked with Steven Aftergood, head of the Project on Government and Secrecy for the Washington, DC-based American Federation of Scientists, who called the latest land seizure \"outrageous and counter-intu- itive. If the security there wasn't sufficient during the Cold War,\" he asks, \"how can they justify grabbing more land in the interests of security after it's over? They can't have it both ways.\" Campbell and the grass-roots White Sides Defense Committee will probably try to fight this one in Congress.

FUND QUARTERLY REPORT After serving as Chairman of the Fund for UFO Research since its inception in 1979, Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., retired in April, but he will continue to serve on the Fund's National Board of Directors. The Board se- lected Richard Hall, another co-founder of the organi- zation, to serve as Chairman. The Board also approved the selection of Craig Phillips as Vice Chairman and Fred Whiting as Secretary-Treasurer. Each officer will serve for a period of two years. The Board acknowl- edges Dr. Maccabee's many contributions during his tenure as Chairman and thanks him for his outstanding leadership in the field of UFOlogy. In a totally unrelated matter, you may have heard about a document circulating through the UFO com- munity, prepared by \"The Associated Investigators Group,\" the members of which are identified only by pseudonyms. The report, entitled The Fund for CIA Research?, makes baseless accusations about Dr. Maccabee and the Fund. For the record: the Fund does not have any relationships with the intelligence com- munity, nor is it supported by any government agency — covert or otherwise. The investigation into the Roswell UFO crash case continued during this period, following Board approval of a proposal by Karl Pflock, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense and currently a full-time re- searcher/writer. Operating on a grant from the Fund, Pflock travelled to New Mexico to interview a number of witnesses and other sources of information—some pre- viously unknown to other researchers. Pflock's report on his findings is expected to be completed later this year.

Price $16.95 Time travel is a subject-matter which has always fasci- nated me, maybe even haunted or driven me to some kind of obsession. But it is a subject area of which I know little or nothing. For example: \"How does the modern time traveler move throughout space-time without upsetting the apple cart of events in the time stream?\" I think the resolution to this enigma might have some- thing to do with parallel or multidimensional realities, which have to do with certain UFO encounters (and perhaps are what UFOs are trying to gradually demon- strate to us, or what they are trying to teach us, among other lessons). There are many books available that can help shed more light on this extremely exciting topic, but anyone interested in time travel, or any serious student of the relevant areas of physics, math or quantum and/or indeterminate philosophies or sciences should begin by picking up a copy of Marc Davenport's Visitors From Time: The Secret of The UFOs. Marc Davenport is a 41-year-old author and a life- long student of UFOs who was born and raised in Joplin, Missouri. His background includes the physi- cal sciences, specifically an education in chemical engineering as preparation for a career in commercial manufacturing engineering in the automotive, aero- space and defense industries. After speaking with Marc on the phone, I sense that his feelings about the occupants of UFOs is that they are really not exotic extraterrestrials but TRAVELERS! These travelers are from either another dimension in time or space-time, or from our immediate as well as our distant future. After decades of research into the UFO phenomenon. Marc came upon the time travel model after utilizing a kind of game theory technique he worked with as an en- gineer. This is a kind of \"consciousness-boosting exer- cise\" or a \"paradigm-reconciling\" strategy. The idea behind solving a conflict or problem relies more on process rather than product. In other words, HOW to think about the problem is a lot more critical than fo- cusing only upon coming up with the correct solution. Marc decided upon the time travel component of the UFO mystery after he turned the problem upside-down and looked at it from a different perspective. The results of these \"game theory\" efforts take the form of a careful examination of many dozens of UFO case histories from locales all over the earth, which is something refreshing compared to most American UFO books. Most U.S. books overemphasize the ETH (ExtraTerrestrial Hypothesis), which is why many scien- tists feel U.S. UFO lit ignores serious scholarship. But Marc's book is different. He has written a well-organized and methodical analysis which concludes with a working hypothesis that scientifically corroborates his notions of time travel. After my second reading I was left with the powerful sense that although no one single case history could really clinch the time travel case, it was the accu- mulated effort that did it for me. Marc's assemblage of materials, stories and resources is most impressive. Marc begins and then slowly works his way toward his final point, his working hypothesis. Along the way are the many points about physics, and colour analysis, in- Continued on Page 21 PAGE 14 NUMBER 307 NOVEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The following case summaries were prepared by Jerold R.

Two deputies enroute to investigate an uniden- tified bright light in a rural area, and a third deputy nine miles to their SW watched the light at a distance be- fore it suddenly just disappeared. Minutes later at the complainant's home a very large object with two bright lights in front flew slowly and silently at tree top height directly over the two deputies before \"zipping\" out of sight. Shortly thereafter the third deputy, now 12 miles away and with a deputy from another parish (county), watched an object as large as a commercial jet that re- sembled a bright ball at a distance but was triangular- shaped when overhead, pass slowly and silently over- head then zip away towards the NE. Seconds later the police radio was reporting a bright light going down be- hind the paper mill, 17 miles away. For the next hour or two, more than a half dozen deputies, a shift at a fire station, and possibly up to 50 civilians watched one or more bright, multicolored, ob- jects over a large wetlands area south and southeast of the paper mill change colors, hover silently, bounce up and down like a yo-yo. make sudden jumps in posi- tion, and repeatedly just disappear. Witnesses were east, south and west of the object and estimated their dis- tances from it as several hundred yards to three or four miles. In one case a brightly lit, turtle-shaped, object big- ger than a house floated slowly at tree top level over a small group of civilians before suddenly disappearing. An electronics technician, an estimated five miles NW of the object, with a camcorder and telescope lens got 01:4I seconds of VCR tape before it moved out of his sight. Jeff Sainio's analysis of the tape stated that it was better than usual in quality and strangeness, and that the UFO's lighting characteristics were inconsistent with aircraft, incandescent lights and pyrotechnics. Sometime later, three deputies in two cars were parked north of the paper mill when they spotted a UFO approaching from the west. Turning in front of the paper mill to head it off, one car suddenly found itself di- rectly under the UFO. When the deputy got out and looked up, he found a boomerang-shaped object bigger than a football field hovering silently less than 50 feet above him. A carload of civilians headed in the opposite direction had also stopped. Then the UFO suddenly zipped away and was not seen again. • Log #930321): November 1991, a Thursday morning in a very nice Ft. Lauderdale, FL residential neighbor- hood, a lady picked up her morning paper and was star- tled to see much of the sky filled by a silent, white delta- wing shape; investigator. Sheila Franklin. The witness, a retired stockbroker and private pilot (familiar with normal aircraft) said that the wingspan was 1200 feet and the al- titude was only 1500 feet, and it \"floated\" from north to south along her residential street. The object was dull white with no engines, wheels or openings but the un- derside was \"covered in a grid-like structural pattern\" of gray lines. When the drifting object was obscured by palm trees in the lady's front yard, she ran through the house to her boat dock on a canal where she had a good view south, but the object was not visible anywhere in the sky. Inquiries turned up no other reports of this large object to either police, military, or the press. • Log #9306140 Goodrich, MI, Genesee County, 5:15 a.m., on February 2, 1993; investigators, James Pajtas & Shirley Coyne. A woman was leaving her home at 5:15 a.m., heading to Pontiac, Michigan where she works. She backed the car out of the garage into the turn around. She put the car in drive and started to move for- ward when she noticed 2 bright lights above the 2 houses on the south side of Hill Road, some 800 feet away. She drove down her 700-foot driveway, never taking her eyes off the lights. She stopped the car when she reached Hill Road. The radio was on so she reached over and turned it off, then rolled her window down. As she sat there watching for about a minute and a half, she could not hear any sound. She suddenly got the feeling that she was being watched. The stationary object started to move slowly toward her, getting lower as it came. She put her head out the window to get a better look. It came directly over the top of her, not more than 20 feet off the ground. When it was over her, she could see an \"egg-shaped, fat-belly\" that was wider than it was long and glowing. It had massive \"wings\" that swept forward which were wide at the body and tapering to a narrow rounded tip. The wing span appeared to be 250-300 feet. As the object went over her, she became aware of a \"humming-buzz.\" She did not hear the sound as the object approached or after it went over, only while it was overhead. After the object passed she pulled out onto the road so she could see where it was going. The object \"dipped\" down a little then ascended to go over some trees. \"It began to bank to the left, like it was spinning on the tip of the left wing.\" The object then leveled-off and she started dri- ving west toward Hwy M-15. The object had to ascend to get over the power lines, then it descended and flew at the same rate of speed she was driving. She got very ner- vous about it being there and refused to look at it again. When she reached Hwy M-15, she glanced right (north) to see if there was on-coming traffic. She could see the NOVEMBER 1993 NUMBER 307 PAGE 1 5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL object hovering over the field, just off the highway. She made a left turn and headed south, never looking back. • Log #930613C: Gladstone, MI, Delta County, March 12, 1993, 5:20 p.m.; investigator Scott A. Smith of Marquette, MI. A woman went to the Gladstone High School to pick up her daughter and a friend from volley ball practice. At 5:20 p.m., she was parked on llth Street in front of the school looking down the alley to- ward the side entrance when she saw an object rise up from behind the building. The object was blue in color and shaped like a block \"Y\". The witness thought it was about 3 feet in diameter. The girls arrived at the car and the woman pointed out the object to them. Two other girls were called over to look at it. They said it was just a kite and they went back to the building. The object was moving slowly in sort of a tumbling motion and was heading north, a little above tree-top level. It turned and headed directly down Michigan Avenue, which is Hwy 2 and 41, the main street of town. The woman and girls continued to follow it, staying about 200 feet from it. They noticed that it had a \"shim- mer\" of heat or something around its perimeter, like it was giving off heat or a mist. They could also see a green light on one of the arms of the \"Y\". They could only see the light when the object tumbled a certain way. As they neared a party store, the object stopped and hovered so they stopped. The girls got out of the car so they could get a better look. It tumbled around in that one spot for about a minute then started moving again. The witnesses followed for a ways then stopped to grab some binoculars from a friend. By the time they got back on the road the object was about 2 blocks ahead of them. When they came to a parking lot near the power plant and campgrounds, they pulled in and got out of the car.-The woman could hear an airplane as she stepped out of the car. She could see a plane flying low over the bay, just above the roofs of the ice-fishing shacks. The object had risen high in the sky and headed out over the bay. They watched until they could no longer see it. The sighting had taken 15 minutes. • Log #930618C: Lukachukai, Arizona, Apache County, August 10-15, 1982, at 1:45 a.m. a 9-year-old boy was traveling with his father and father's friend, en- route to work the Lukachukai Rodeo. They were ten miles NW of town when the witness noticed the \"UFO\"; investigator Richard D. Seifried. The object resembled an \"ordinary star\" except it was moving. As he watched the object got closer and closer until it was almost in front of them, then sparkled and seemed to disintegrate before their eyes, leaving a \"hazy cloud.\" They woke the friend who also saw the \"cloud.\" They thought perhaps they had seen a meteor. They continued on for another five miles and then saw a glowing light off to the left of the road. When they reached the top of a hill, they got out of the truck and climbed onto an icebox in the back of the truck. Looking over the edge of the canyon, they could see a brilliant green light which lit the whole canyon. The boy's father lifted him onto his shoulders and that was when he saw the object. He tried to con- vince his father to hike down to it. The friend was curled up inside the truck, frightened, and the boy could not understand why; he had a desire to go to the craft but his father convinced him that the snakes were thick down there. They watched the green glow for about thirty minutes and then continued on their journey. They stopped at a convenience store and his father told the store clerk, \"You won't believe what I just saw.\" The clerk said an Indian family had stopped at the store ear- lier and were very frightened. They claimed that some- thing had landed on their land. The family came to the store to call and report it to the authorities. • Log #9306ZOC: Niles, MI, Berrien County, at 11:25 p.m., on February 15, 1993, a woman was driving north, coming home from work, when she observed a large bright yellowish light in the northern sky; investigator Laura Leitz. It was an overcast night so no other \"stars\" were visible. She continued to travel and the light be- came hidden behind trees and landscape. A short dis- tance later she observed something she thought was a fire atop a tower in the large pig pen near her home. There is no tower in the pig pen. The closer she got, the brighter the object appeared. She stopped the car and got out for a closer look, even removing her glasses to see if they made a difference. The object was like a \"bonfire with a dark blue dome\" hovering above a couple of large trees next to her house. There was no sound; it had no windows she could see, but did have several ap- pendages \"like hat-pins\" protruding from underneath it. The object was approximately 50 feet wide and at an altitude of 50 feet, and about 150 feet from the wit- ness. She got back into the car and drove 600 feet to the back of her home. When she got out of the car the object was gone. She had observed the object for five minutes. • Log #930823C: Norman, OK, Cleveland County, August 10, 1993, at 2:15 a.m., two men were in their backyard watching the Perseid Meteor Showers; inves- tigator Richard D. Seifried. Mr. \"A\" saw two square lights over the roof-top of the house heading due south. The lights were set apart from each other, flying in ab- solutely perfect formation, never gaining or losing ground relative to each other. \"They looked exactly alike,\" and moved very slowly in a straight line from north to south. He tried to put the lights in a category that was familiar, like an airplane or helicopter, but there was no sound. Mr. \"B\" was unable to see them at first but was soon able to focus on the lights. They dashed through the house and out to the street. The two lights were moving steadily, fluidly and quietly toward the south. They fol- lowed them down the street until they came to the in- PAGE 16 NUMBER 307 NOVEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL tersection of Stinson and McKinley. The lights made an abrupt left turn to the east. The turn was not sharp, just a \"graceful\" 45 degree turn. When the lights turned east they moved away so fast the men were unable to see them. \"They vanished within seconds.\" Both remarked on the absence of any red lights, at which point red lights suddenly came on. The total sighting lasted for five minutes. • Log #930716C: Page, North Dakota, Cass County, during the winter of 1968, between 9:00 and 11:00 p.m.; investigator Davina Ryszka, State Director for South Dakota. The witness, a senior in high school, was baby- sitting at the local banker's house. She had gone to the front door to look out. There was a tree in the front yard and through the bare branches, she could see a light \"dancing\" around the sky. The object would dart away quickly and come back to the same spot, then it would move up and down rapidly. It was also changing colors as it zig-zagged around; red, blue, white. She watched the lights for a while then called her mother, who then called the neighbor ladies. The banker and his wife came home and she asked if they had seen the light, which they hadn't. She left the banker's house and started walking the two blocks to her home. In order to get home she had to walk up a small hill and go past the school on the north side of the road. For some reason she looked up and there was an object hovering low enough that she did not have to strain her neck to look at it. It was self-illuminated and there were two rows of windows with lights on inside the object. She ran down the hill as fast as she could go and into her house. Her father asked what was wrong and she said nothing, not mentioning the object hovering over the playground. She does not know how it came about, but later her German teacher asked if she would talk to some Air Force men. They took her out of class and questioned her in depth, one sitting across a table from her while the other sat off to one side, observing her. She felt like she was being interrogated; the questions fright- ened her and she was afraid people would think she was crazy. After it was over, the man at the table turned and looked at the man off to the side. She also looked at the other man, who never said a word, just nodded his head. The man asking the questions turned to her and said, Well, we believe that you saw what we call a \"Mother Ship.\" She asked what a mother ship was and he told her that they are the ones that are inhabited and the other ones are like robot ships and do not have any life forms on them. She has no idea why they gave her that information. The men were in \"spiffy\" Air Force Blues and she has no reason to doubt they were anything other than Air Force officers. • Log #930404): On the evening of November, 13 1991, a silvery, round-cornered triangle reflecting the setting sun appeared among the clouds to a professional educator/administrator and her husband while driving in their car; investigator, Dr. Joye Jefferies Pugh. It ex- tended an \"arch of white light\" to a point in the sky and retracted it, several times, and the last time a second, identical triangular object appeared at the end of the arch. The two objects then proceeded to circle a lake near Douglas, GA and emit light as night fell. The two witnesses reached the house they were headed for and other family members were called out to watch the cir- cling display, sometimes exhibiting very slow, and some- times very fast movements in the air. The initial witness was fascinated and continued to watch this for two hours. She telephoned a civilian airport nearby and talked to the manager who could see the anomalous lights from his vantage point, but not as well as the family in the lakeside house. She called Moody AFB and spoke to several officers on duty, one who told her that they had no planes up, and another who quizzed her at length about what she was seeing. Shortly thereafter six pointed triangles in tight formation, visible due to many small lights on their undersides (right-half red lights, left-half green lights) came onto the scene from the east and played \"cat and mouse\" games with the original two objects in the sky, again with the anom- alously slow, then too fast movements. The two white objects would sometimes emit white sparks \"like a sparkler,\" and the six red/green triangles emitted jet-like sounds. Finally, the noisy objects flew away to the hori- zon in various directions, and the two triangles passed right over the witness' position, at an estimated alti- tude of 75 feet, revealing a shape that compared with a billiard ball rack and seemed to be about the same size. The witness, watching them through binoculars, saw three white circles of light inboard from the rounded cor- ners on each, and heard a faint hissing sound as they passed over her and flew slowly northeast out of sight. • Log #930701E: Just after 2 a.m. on 30 April 1993, a thirty-year-old family man was walking from his house in Millville, MA out to his car when he saw a silent tri- angle of red lights approaching in the sky; investigator. Morton Schafer. This pattern resolved into some kind of dark cigar-shaped object, with at least nine red. blue and white lights on it, some blinking. He thought to wave his arm as it passed some 3000 feet from him at an angle of 70° in the air. Immediately, a white light moved from the rear of the object to the middle and beamed briefly right into his eyes, as if directed at him in response to his gesture. It flew on straight over the town at perhaps 200 miles per hour and out of sight.

Keel is regarded as a controversial old UFO cuss by some (he continues to insist that the Roswell Incident was the result of a Japanese fugo balloon), but I've always found him a likable and stimulating one to boot. Based on Keel's unstinting review, then, I dashed off an order for same to both Bob Girard's Arcturus Books and William Corliss' Source Book Project, thinking that neither would have this obscure item on hand. To my somewhat dubious relish and dismay, both did. which only demonstrates the obvi- ous: if you can't find a particular work in the catalog of either of these two gentlemanly booksellers, chances are you won't find it anywhere. Whatever Keel's other shortcomings, he didn't steer me wrong on this particular occasion. Subterranean Worlds is exactly what he promised it would be: a \"fortean\" study of a particular subject in all of its man- ifestations, one that quietly amasses its data, presents little in the way of editorial commentary, and essential- ly allows the reader to reach his or her own conclu- sions. So what do subterranean worlds and the many age- old rumors and myths of same, along with their asso- ciated diminutive inhabitants, have to do with shiny new UFOs? Little or much, depending on your partic- ular point of view, and your proclivity (or not) to think of UFOs and alien entities in psychological, phenome- nological and metaphysical terms and images. If UFOs are indeed newly arrived nuts 'n' bolts space- ships and nothing but. then you won't find much to relate to in this more or less comprehensive survey of rumors and writings regarding a hollow Earth and the decidedly mysterious denizens of same. Those willing to adopt a longer, somewhat more historical point of view, will find much food — I'm tempted to say com- plex carbohydrates — for thought. The chapter on Ray Palmer and Richard Shaver, for instance, including the latter's insistence on stunted, malevolent dwarfs and their insatiable sexual appetites is worth the price of admission alone: it literally cries out for further careful consideration and analysis in \"The idea of the dero [degenerative energy robots] assembled the shards of 20th century chads—wars, assassinations, disappearances, and all the other disasters that pepper the news- papers—into a comprehensible shape. But the Shaver Mystery ultimately failed to become a living myth...because it was overwhelmingly negative...Shaver was never able to offer his readers any yang to offset his pages of yin; he was never able to give them a plan of action, a way to defeat the evil creatures...who denied us [their] hidden knowledge and magical machines...In the end, he felt it didn't matter what we did. We were doomed whether we realized it or not.\" —Walter Kafton-Minkel Subterranean Worlds light of today's UFO abduction experiences. Keel has long complained—or pointed out, if you prefer—that the modern UFO phenomenon and its many manifes- tations have their roots firmly planted in the so-called Shaver Mystery, which reached its popular peak in the late 1940s, at the same time that UFO reports were suddenly on the upsurge. Kafton-Minkel makes no such claims or compar- isons himself, and readers looking for same will sim- ply have to read between the lines. The meanings and implications are there nonetheless. While ufologists as a whole tend to look to the heavens for answers, Subterranean Worlds, somewhat lugubriously subti- tled \"100,000 years of dragons, dwarfs, the dead, lost races & UFOs from inside the earth,\" suggests that some of the clues may lie underneath our very feet. Recommended for the fleet of foot and mind.

ALIEN SCRIPTURE Edited by Kevin McClure T his new quarterly out of England holds some promise, but when compared to its American coun- terparts like Crash Collusion and UFO Encounters, one has to wonder what our English cousins are using in place of computers and laser printers—typewriters and decades-old copying machines? In other words, the for- mat leaves a lot to be desired, although editor McClure, who also publishes Wild Places, promises future im- provements in terms of both production and layout, subscriptions permitting.We'll help the project along as best we can, because this first issue contains much good writing, including substantial contributions by McClure himself, Martin Kottmeyer, and Hilary Evans. The prospect itself is certainly an intriguing one.

Letters to Mufon UFO Journal PONTILILLO'S POINTS I had promised myself upon completion of the manu- script for \"Demons, Doctors & Aliens\" that I would not bother replying to any resulting negative reviews. I full well realized that my observations and conclusions would be anathema to many in the UFO community. However, Robert H. Coddington's review of my work (MUFON UFO Journal, #305, September 1993) was re- plete with erroneous characterizations and gross mis- statements of my research. A few brief points: 1) Nowhere do I assert that alien abductions are ex- clusively a Western phenomenon. I observed that they are primarily a Western phenomenon. 2) Since I concluded that alien abductions are one subset of a geographically extensive, time-worn cycle of abduction-oriented subversion myths, Cynthia Hind's South African cases support my premise quite nicely. 3) While it is true that we cannot prove a negative, neither are we obliged to seriously accept the possibility of that for which there is no substantial evidence. 4) The reviewer has totally misunderstood my point regarding medieval witchtrial testimony. I explore in depth the nature of demonic sexual experiences and compare them to extraterrestrial sexual experiences. The role of the medieval investigator (who physically tortures a \"witch\" in order to extract prurient tales) is paralleled by the modern abductionist, who having sim- ilar motives, employs psychological manipulation and torture. 5) Mr. Coddington's lengthy discussion notwith- standing, an examination of the abduction literature does indicate a marked bias (especially where sexual matters are concerned) toward the experiences of women. 6) I stand by my point that all major pro-abduction books reveal the use of leading questions by researchers on their hypnotized subjects. As Dr. Simon has never es- poused a pro-abduction stance, he clearly was not in- cluded in the above statement in my paper. Unfortunately, a number of pro-abduction researchers have misused his interviews with the Hills. If anyone has impugned Dr. Simon's professionalism, let the blame fall where it properly lies. 7) I am not attempting to \"drag the already contro- versial UFO subject into the rancorous socio-moral schism over abortion that is troubling our society today.\" I am trying, however, to initiate serious discussion con- cerning the sexual aspects of the alien abduction phe- nomenon. As is apparent from their writings, the self- professed high priesthood of Abductionology knows little about female anatomy and sexuality, and cares even less.

The credibility of this witness can be partially assessed by judging the possible reality of such terms as \"gravity amplifiers\", \"gravitational wave- guides\", and the emission of gravity waves from Element 115. At the risk of sounding like a refuge from the Skeptical Inquirer let me warn readers that Lazar's statements sound absurd from the viewpoint of anyone who knows even a little physics. The force of gravity, whether examined from the classical Newtonian perspective, or from general rela- tivity theory, describes an effect that is exceedingly small unless huge amounts of mass are involved. Surely any kind of waveguide for gravitational waves would re- quire quantities of matter on the order of stellar masses. I would not expect to find such a device able to fit into a spacecraft sitting on the surface of planet Earth. The term \"gravity amplifier\" has no meaning at all in current physics unless you add mass to the object whose gravity is to be amplified or accelerate mass to relativistic speeds; now you are talking about something more costly and energy demanding than the aborted super- conducting supercollider. Again we are stuck with tech- nology that will not fit into a spacecraft of reasonable size. Finally, the emission of gravity waves from any nu- cleus, even if one not currently known to us, strikes me as more fantastical than pulling rabbits from empty hats. In the twentieth century we really do know some- thing about gravity and any new theories or propulsion systems that involve gravity must fit to some degree into currently understood theory. I judge that the claims of Bob Lazar do not fit at all and hence must be viewed with the greatest suspicion. I well understand that my negative comments sound like the prattlings of one of Lazar's \"jealous academic assassins.\" However I claim no special expertise in gravitational theory and have no ego to support in this area. If Lazar can back up his claims with more than some \"technobabble,\" I would be the first to applaud his insight into gravity and spaceflight. Please somebody demonstrate to me that I am wrong. —Ted Spickler Wheeling, WV PAGE 20 NUMBER 307 NOVEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL FREE READING LIST & other sources of reliable information on the UFO phenomenon, including more than 50 book titles, or- ganizations & publications.

VISITORS FROM TIME - Continued from Page 14 verse square laws and the mechanics of velocity, as well as boundary areas of the psychology of perception. A bit of careful speculation finally gives the book its particu- lar tone, and helps present time travel as a reasonable component behind how the UFO experience might even- tually be resolved. A critical piece of the puzzle, anyhow. But this is a cross-disciplinary effort, in a way. It is in- deed popular literature that anyone can discover and en- joy, except for a page of physics here and there. Marc also hopes the university community picks up on Visitors From Time. This book is indeed a break-through document that should interest anyone, for a variety of reasons. First, it is a monograph of our current life and times, and as such it is a text of sociological import. Second, it is a 21st Century foreshadowing of scientific opportunities and implicit economic industries. And thirdly it suggests the very nearly limitless cultural possibilities inherent within the application of time travel technology. Marc Davenport is a MUFON State Section Director in Manhattan, KS. Bill Krampe, writer and researcher Victoria, British Columbia NOVEMBER 1993 NUMBER 307 PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL December 1993 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Saturn (magnitude 0.9), in Capricornus, lies low in the S at twilight and sets in the W about 9 PM in mid-December. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) is visible very low in the ESE early in the month, rising less than an hour before the Sun. Jupiter (-1.8), moving from Virgo into Libra, climbs higher in the SE sky throughout December. The huge planet rises about 4 AM on the 1st and about 2:30 by month's end. It is 4° above the lunar crescent on the 10th. Mars Observer Update: Three days before Mars Observer was to go into orbit around the red planet, disaster struck. The craft's transmitters were turned off during fuel tank pressurization. When they were or- dered to switch back on 5 minutes later, the transmitters were silent. As of this writing, it isn't known whether Observer en- tered orbit later as planned, shot by the planet, or exploded. While speculation centered upon faulty transistors, no one knows for sure the cause of NASA's most recent failure. The suggestion that a rogue group in the space agency was be- hind the disaster and attempted to cover up \"the truth'\" about the \"face on Mars\" can't be taken seriously. NASA's behav- ior, however, in failing to look objectively at the independent research of others has been less than exemplary. Meteor Showers: Unlike last year, the peak of the Geminid shower won't be marred by moonlight on the night of December 13-14. While the shower's radiant point is up most of the night, maximum should be achieved during the morning hours when 50 or more bright white meteors fan out across the sky from Gemini the Twins. The much fainter Ursids, radiating from near the star Kochab in Ursa Minor (Little Dipper), escape the moonlight after 1 AM on the 23rd when the Moon sets. Toward dawn 15 to 20 meteors per hour might be seen. Moon Phases: Last quarter—December 6 New moon—December 13 ^p First quarter—December 20 ^) Full moon—December 28 Q The Stars: The brilliant constellations of winter gradually are taking the place of the inconspicuous autumn stars during the middle of the evening. The Winter Circle luminaries—Sirius, Procyon, Pollux and Castor,'Capella, Aldebaran, and Rigel—surround that most spectacular of patterns, Orion the Hunter. Follow the warrior's three belt stars down left to the brightest nighttime star, Sirius, in Canis Major the Big Dog. A line traced through the belt to the upper right extends to Aldebaran, the fiery right eye of the Bull Taurus. Betelgeuse (Orion's right shoulder) and Rigel (his left knee) provide a fine comparison of color differences between stars. Betelgeuse's reddish hue indicates that it is a relatively cool M-type star, while blue-white Rigel is a hot B star. Our own Sun's yellow color tells us it is of medium surface tempera- ture—a G type.

This is an opportunity for present state directors, assistant state directors, state section direc- tors, and other leaders in the eastern region to accept greater responsibilities within the Mutual UFO Network. The eastern region is composed of the fol- lowing states: ME, VT, NH, MA, CT, RI, NY, PA, NJ, DE, MD, WV, VA, NC, SC, GA, FL, PR, and VI. The Regional Director is elected by the members within the above states. Any interested person is invited and encouraged to submit their name to either their respective state director or Walt Andrus in Seguin as a candidate for this vacancy by November 15, 1993, so an election may be conducted by mail. This presti- gious position is only one of the four MUFON Board of Directors elected by the membership that they rep- resent. To date, only two candidates have been nominated. They are Dana M. Schmidt, J.D., State Section Director for the Rochester, New York area, who has been a member of MUFON since 1980 and David F. Webb, former Massachusetts State Director and Eastern Regional Director, joining MUFON in 1974. Eastern Regional State Directors, should continue mailing their UFO sighting reports to Jerold \"Ron\" Johnson, MUFON Deputy Director of Investigations, 12700 Silver Creek, Austin, TX 78727, until such time as a new Eastern Regional Director is elected. MUFON 1994 SYMPOSIUM The theme for the MUFON 1994 International UFO Symposium is \"UFOLOGY: A Historical Perspec- tive,\" commemorating MUFON's 25th anniversary and symposia. It will be hosted by Texas MUFON at the Hyatt Regency Hotel on Town Lake in Austin, Texas, on July 8, 9, and 10. Ellen R. Stuart, State Director, is serving as the host chairperson. Special events are being planned to celebrate MUFON's silver anniversary. Several of the speakers will draw from the histori- cal aspects of Ufology in their presentations. They are James A. Harder, Ph.D. (APRO), Richard H. Hall (NICAP), John F. Schuessler (MUFON), and Robert O. Dean (military) from Tucson, AZ. Other speakers confirmed are George Wingfield (English Crop Circles); George Knapp (Russian UFO Files); Rev. Barry H. Downing, Ph.D., author, minister, and con- sultant; Michael Lindeman from Santa Barbara, CA; and Ed Dames, President of Psi-Tec (Remote Viewing). OUTA LIMITS UFO ENIGMA MUSEUM John A. and Sherron Price, owners of the first UFO museum in Roswell, New Mexico, have sadly announced that their building lease will expire on January 1, 1994. They have chosen not to renew their lease since the owner wants to sell the building. They have made an offer to the City of Roswell UFO Museum to purchase the collectables accumulated over the past years. All items on loan will be returned to their proper owners. An alternate choice is to nego- tiate with the town of Corona, New Mexico to possi- bly reopen the museum as a non-profit venture. They feel that a museum in Corona would be a tourist attraction to the area near the actual crash site and also a memorial dedicated to the Brazel and Proctor fami- lies. Ten-thousand people have toured the Outa Limits UFO Enigma Museum since it opened in April 1992. Clifford E. Stone is Director of Research and Ralph Heick is the Museum Historian Director. BETTY HILL RECOVERING MUFON member Kathy Marden and niece of Betty Hill (Portsmouth. NH) has advised that Betty was recently hospitalized with stomach cancer. Her sur- geon removed a large malignant tumor and 80 percent of her stomach. She will not require additional therapy and the doctor expects a full recovery. Prior to enter- ing the hospital, in her typical jovial style, Betty was suggesting to family and friends that this could have been only another missing fetus case, but the aliens had apparently forgotten to remove the fetus that they had implanted in her stomach. In her letter Kathy said, \"I wish that you could have seen the quizzical expres- sion on her nurse's face when I asked Betty what color eyes it had.\" Although she had just come out of surgery, she managed to smile and say to the nurse— \"family joke.\" Dana M.

MUFON AMATEUR RADIO NET Due to the inherent poor propagation of radio signals associated with sunspot cycles, the ten and twenty meter amateur network frequencies have been so unre- liable that these nets are being temporarily discontin- ued. The only MUFON amateur radio net that will meet regularly is the long-standing net on 40 meters— 7.237 MHz each Saturday morning at 8 a.m. Eastern Standard or Daylight Time.
