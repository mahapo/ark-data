FROM THE EDITOR Readers counting the number of pages, rather than issues, in their subscription will remember we were four short with the August Journal. With this 28 instead of 24-page issue we now stand caught up. Inside you'll find coverage of the Lincoln summer symposium, an update on English \"corn\" circles and Gulf Breeze, and speculative articles on UFO car-lift cases and the kind of planet theoretical aliens might inhabit, along with most of our regular departments. The November number will focus on Whitley Strieber's experiences and UFO abductions in general. Time and space permitting, we also hope to be able to get to our considerable backlog of correspondence. Until then ...

What follows, then, is more a litany of personal impressions than a blow-by-blow account of actual events. Abstracts taken from the 1988 Proceedings, for example, are reprinted instead of a summary of the speeches themselves. The complete Proceedings (\"Abductions and the E- T Hypothesis,\" 241 pp) are available directly from MUFON for $15 plus $1.50 postage and handling. All talks and exhibitions took place in the 9-storey Nebraska Center on the University of Nebraska campus, Lincoln, the weekend of June 24-26, while most of the Midwest was gripped in a combined heat wave and drought. The Center's air condition- ing was strained at times, but for the most part, accommodations were com- fortable and pleasant. Those in atten- dance probably numbered between 250 and 300, and included Gulf Breeze eyewitnesses Mr. Ed and wife, the usual raft of familiar faces, and arch UFO skeptics Philip Klass and Robert Baker, about whom more later. The press, electronic and print, which descended like locusts on last year's Washington-based symposium, were for the most part absent, though at least one independent TV/video production team was pres- ent. Certainly, the atmosphere was more relaxed than at Washington. William Moore was replaced at the last minute by Los Angeles TV pro- ducer and MJ-12 confidant, Jamie Shandera, who handled himself extem- peraneously well at both a press con- ference and the speaker's podium. Anyone who may have wondered about his involvement in the MJ-12 affair, contrasted with his previous anonymity within the UFO commun- ity, probably had any fears or suspi- cions laid to rest. The gist of Shande- MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 ra's presence was an impression that MJ-12 related events may unfold within the next two months, possibly from within the intelligence comunity, and probably before Ronald Reagan leaves office. A growing frustration on his and Moore's behalf was also expressed. Should these indications of revelation not be made public dur- ing that time-frame, Shandera sug- gested, it may be the occasion for their returning to a more mundane and better-paying pasttime than end- lessly pursuing MJ-12 and related evidence. Unlike last year, when Communion and abductions in general held center stage, this summer's background buzz was provided by pictures and pur- ported events coming out of Gulf Breeze well. They would seemingly have to have pulled the wool over their own eyes, along with those of their inter- locutors. No one can deny that pos- sibility or disprove a negative, but their performance under pressure struck this observer as honest and unrehearsed. HUMOROUS TOUCH But the matter hardly ends there, as anyone knows who has been keep- ing up with the case in the pages of the Journal. Too many other people in the Gulf Breeze area have reported similar sightings of the same squat UFO pictured in Ed's photographs. 1 The analysis of those pictures fell to Dr. Bruce Maccabee, whose findings Unlike last year, when Communion and abductions in general held center stage, this summer's back- ground buzz was provided by pictures and pur- ported events coming out of Gulf Breeze, Florida. Florida. The two major eyewitnesses, Mr. Ed and wife, sat through an hour of questioning by the MUFON board of directors during a private gathering Sunday morning. A close-up exami- nation of the personalities involved usually helps dispel lingering doubts. Certainly, no new ones emerged on this occasion. If anything, I had an even harder time imagining the two conspiring in the hall outside before their appearance, whispering among one another to get their stories straight. Subjective impressions, of course, don't solve a case one way or the other, especially one as contro- versial as Gulf Breeze is turning out to be. They did convey the feeling in this instance, though, that if Ed and wife are engaged in blatant hoaxing, they are not only unsung amateur masters at trick photography, but adept psychological manipulators as and recounting of events in the Flor- ida panhandle were showcased Sat- urday night, and which take up pages 114-204 of the published proceedings. Anyone wishing to comment on the case one way or the other really should familiarize themselves with Maccabee's exhaustive reporting. A resounding note of humor, an increasingly rare commodity these days both within and without the field, was struck by the usually aus- tere laser physicist at the close of his presentation, before answering ques- tions from the audience. Finishing his talk, Maccabee casually unloosened his tie, which only seemed approp- riate, given the night's heat and humidity. The impromptu strip-tease con- tinued, as the good doctor not only stripped off jacket, but shirt, too, to reveal a black \"Twilight Zone\" T-shirt underneath. A pair of donned sun- 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Walt Andrus, left, and Dr. Bruce Maccabee at MUFON press confer- ence. shades capped off the surprising satorial transformation which caught the crowd with its collective pants down. The humor, alas, was not to last. After speeches by Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, I saw outside the aud- itorium with Mr. Klass and professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, Robert Baker, who accompanied him. Some have speculated that Baker was being groomed by Klass as his UFO- skeptical successor, but I think one need not worry, if that's the word, on this point, the introductions were pleasant enough, and I certainly held no prior perception of Mr. Baker, aside from the obvious assumption, that being in Klass's company, he was hardly likely to harbor any overt pro-UFO sentiments himself, of wha- tever stripe. Since I'm no proselytizer for the phenomenon myself, however, I hold healthy skepticism, or for that matter, disbelief, against no one. I did, though, proceed to operate under the naive assumption that a friendly dialogue might ensue between all parties. The topic of conversation was turned by Klass, who wanted me to imagine myself the President's national security advisor and respond accord- ingly to his (the imaginary Presi- dent's) questions regarding whether the MJ-12 material, if true and actual, should or should be released to the public. The mock conversation went on in this way for a few moments, when Klass left to fetch Cokes. Sud- denly, I found Baker, a diminutive fel- low, looming over me in my chair, engorged with indignation, bordering on rage. Given the circumstances, all the details of his outburst escape me now, but I do remember a verbal blast to the effect that \"You don't know anything about human person- ality! You can't influence anyone!\" As best- I can judge, Baker's ire was up because he presumed me to be an uncritical \"UFO believer\" per- sonally, who belonged to a field of gullible fools puffed up with a false sense of their own importance and that of their subject, and specifically the argument that making public the alleged MJ-12 and government UFO cover-up would panic the public. Whether I even hold such beliefs myself is moot, because the subject of our conversation was entirely dic- tated by Baker's colleague, Klass, and was never meant to reflect my own opinion(s) about anything. I have, however, pointed out to Klass in the past that Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds, by most accounts, upset a sizeable portion of the listening audi- ence. UMBRAGE Baker seems to have taken extreme umbrage at the notion that anyone or group could significantly influence the thought or behavior of another, yet here he was, turning apoplectic before my very nose, presumably in response to something I said and he then per- ceived and interpreted in his own rather ungenerous fashion. \"Well, I certainly seem to have upset you with very little effort,\" I finally managed to blurt. This resulted in an escalation of blood pressure I had not previously thought possible, at least without fatal consequences. \"You couldn't panic the country if I gave you a $100 mil- lion budget!\" he shouted. My reply to this was to offer to drop a hydrogen bomb on Oklahoma City, and return him considerable change. His response was to stalk off in high dudgeon. I presume this is the sort of rea- soned objectivity and rational inquiry MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Jamie Shandera supposedly taught in the CSICOP field manual, or is it confrontation guidelines? I would not bore you with this now and here, were it not for the fact that reports have begun to filter . back to me from a few correspond- ents of Baker's own view of the above events and conversation, and how I am characterized therein. Instead of an apology, which might be expected under the uncalled for circumstances, I understand that I continue to be calumnied as gullible instead. Calumny is perhaps too strong a word here, given that Ben Johnson advises that the best answer to same is silence. But it does cause one to question the overall holier-than-thou mindset of the academic psychologist, who has the blood of thousands of slain white rats on his hands, and to what end, when their learning is so com- partmentalized, and so rarely directed to observing their own behavior? What good having read and studied the textbooks, when it still allows one to make judgment calls of an individ- ual purely on the basis of the milieu in which he or she is encountered? A preconception is a preconception, whoever holds it. CSICOP as a whole seems to suffer from the same mystical sclero- sis, which is a paralysis of the brain and nervous system when confronted with anomalous input. If my own view is biased, then show me the ambassadors of objectivity within that supposedly MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 august group, the ones who are sup- posedly bent on discovery and know- ledge, instead of the camp-followers of high visibility personalities, the power brokers who assume scientific and moral authority and deign to tell everyone else how things really are, and what can and cannot be. Does the panic scenario, in fact, extend to CSICOP as an organization? Physics, which deals with the simp- lest basics in nature, cannot yet explain how those foundations came into being, or for that matter, even what electricity is. And biology, chem- istry and psychology are but immen- sely interwoven complications of those four fundamental forces. How much harder must they be to comprehend, then, given that you don't subscribe to The Skeptical Inquirer? Inquiring minds like mine want to know.

This 1968 episode differs from most other multiple- witness cases in that (1) neither indi- vidual communicated with the other between the conclusion of the expe- rience and the initiation of the inves- tigation 10 years later, and (2) the 5- year probe into this incident makes it the most thoroughly investigated and documented of any single UFO abduc- tion episode to date.

FALL AND RISE OF ETH In the early years of the UFO contro- versy, UFOlogists believed UFOs to be extraterrestrial spaceships â an idea already suggested by Charles Fort and held by members of the Fortean Society. Forteans, who are interested in a variety of anomalies, connected reports of unidentified aerial phenomena with other mysterious events. In the 1950s Fortean writer John Keel and scientist/countercultu- rist Jacques Vallee rejected the extra- terrestrial hypothesis but continued the Fortean practice of linking UFOs with folkloric creatures and parapsy- chological concerns. Eventually this \"new UFOlogy\" evolved into an inter- pretation of the UFO phenomenon which held it to be a modern form of visioinary experience. But such inter- pretations failed to deal adequately with the growing evidence for a phys- ical, technological (and seemingly extra- terrestrial) phenomenon. Moreover, such well-documented events as the Roswell incident caused American UFOlogists to reconsider the once- discredited idea of a U.S. government UFO cover-up. The new UFOlogy â sometimes called \"mixology\" â con- tinues to dominate European UFO research but is no longer taken seriously in the United States. - Jerry Clark PUBLIC REACTION TO ALIEN CONTACT The question of how the general public would react to an announce- ment of UFO reality has always been a matter of conjecture. With the pos- sibility looming ever larger that the coverup of UFO information may be coming to an end, it is important to examine how this news might influ- ence our society. This paper does not argue for or against the extraterres- trial origin of UFOs, but must â for the sake of this study â assume an interplanetary origin. A survey of mental health care professionals pro- vides a glimpse into how contempor- ary society may react to news of alien contact. - Ray Boeche subjects displaying various psycholog- ical problems, including phobias and \"irrational behavior,\" are reviewed. They suggest the \"skeleton key\" effect: That UFO abduction expe- riences emerging during hypnotic regres- sion sessions used to explore life experiences can explain unconven- tional psychological behavior in the abductee. - Budd Hopkins GULF BREEZE HISTORY As of the time of this writing in early May, the investigation continues and new sightings by numerous wit- nesses have been reported. This report is fundamentally a history of the events as stated by Ed and other witnesses. However, interpretive com- ments, discussions of preliminary tech- nical analyses and discussions of objections and criticisms are also presented. Although my present opin- ions about individual sightings are stated indirectly, I have no final opin- ion as yet. - Bruce Maccabee MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Dr. David Jacobs MJ-12 AND PHIL KLASS WHAT ARE THE FACTS? During the year which has passed since our release of these documents to the public, the most vocal critic by far has been Philip J. Klass, a man who has been a well-known UFO- basher for more than twenty years. The thrust of this paper will be to look at the various charges which have been levelled against the MJ-12 documents by Klass, and to a lesser extent others, who have questioned their authenticity. What emerges from such an examination is the inescapable conclusion that, to date, not one sin- gle point has been raised which, upon competent investigation, shows these documents or the information therein to be a hoax! Indeed, objections which looked damaging at first glance have later proved to be solid evi- dence for authenticity rather than against it. - Moore & Friedman Additional Gulf Breeze Case By Charles D. Flannigan, S.S. Director MUFON SUBJECT: Pensacola, Florida MUFON Case #8 TYPE OF REPORT: CE-1 DATE OF REPORT: 8-20-88 DATE OF INCIDENT: 7-8-88 LOCAL EVALUATION: Great Sig- nificance At 4:54 a.m. on July 8, 1988, Dr. McConnell was sitting up in bed look- ing out over Pensacola Bay. (He typi- cally gets up this time each morning to begin his exercise routine.) As he looked out over the bay, he observed a lighted craft hovering above the water. (The distance was later deter- mined to be approximately 330 feet.) He awakened his wife saying, \"Quick, look out the window.\" Shirley McCon- nell immediately observed a round craft with lighted windows and a large white beam shining on the water. (Beam width later determined to be approximately eight feet in diameter.) Shirley said it was the exact craft that had been printed in the Gulf Breeze Sentinel. The craft outline was clearly discernible because of internal lights reflecting through windows and the large diameter white beam shining on the water. The McConnells observed the sound- less craft for approximately two to three minutes before running to the opposite end of the house in an attempt to view the object from the backyard. Upon entering the yard they could clearly observe the same craft from a different angle. They were now facing south/southeast. Shirley was slightly behind her husband when he said, \"It's leaving\". At this time the craft started moving slowly in a Westerly direction and at the same altitude of 25-30 feet. The craft was now moving toward the rotating beacon on top of the light house at Pensacola Naval Air Station. The craft continued shining the white beam into the water as it crossed Pensacola Bay. As the craft approach- ed the light house it changed direc- tion and disappeared while moving North. There were no conventional air or water craft observed during or after this sighting. Dr. McConnell is a well known and highly reputable pathologist who is extremely skilled in detailed observa- tions. However, he was not wearing glasses during this sighting and his distant vision requires him to do so. Mrs. McConnell has excellent distant vision. Mrs. McConnell has a Bachelor of Science Degree in Food and Nutri- tion. She currently owns a Party Consulting business. Note of Interest â Several weeks prior to this sighting they decided to have their annual house party on Sunday, July 10, 1988. This year's party theme was \"UFO Watch\". Five hundred thirty-five guests were invited of which two hundred ninety-eight attended. The guests arrived not knowing the McConnells had closely observed an unconventional craft just two days before. The McConnells said they purposely avoided much discussion about their sighting.

His last appearance here was \"Paradoxical Energy Levels\" in the June 1988 issue. Since 1980 we Brits have been watching, with rather less than our usual British phlegm, the occurrence of some very odd patterns of distur- bance in fields of grain, mainly in the southern counties of Wiltshire and Hampshire. They were first noticed, almost at the same time, by a cool-headed observer of things anamalous â Ian Mrzyglod (Editor: Mrzyglod, as shown, believe it or not) â and an equally cool-headed scientist, Dr. Terence Meaden, who edits the prestigious Journal of Meteorology and directs the internationally renowned TORRO (Tornado & Storm Research Organisa- tion). In that first year â if \"first\" it was â three large circles turned up in fields of grain near Westbury, Wilt- shire â quite close, as it happens, to our UFO-haunted Warminster in the same county. It's worth defining \"cir- cles\" at this point because all the later ones take a similar form. What Meaden and Mrzyglod observed (after the unfortunate farmer had been given some unwelcome publicity by the local Press) was a precisely defined area in the grain, delineated as sharply as though a giant's biscuit- cutter had descended from above. At the edge of this area the grain stood upright; within it the crop was flat- tened to the ground and swirled clockwise, though continuing to grow as though nothing had happened. One or two ufologists rapidly took this as evidence of visitation by our space brothers. Ian Mrzyglod very properly reserved judgement. Dr. Mea- den began to look for an explanation in terms of atmospheric physics. It is, after all, as every farmer knows, a common hazard of arable farming 8 that the wind and the weather and summer whirlwinds tend to muck about with one's fields and to leave patches of damage. The only oddity about the 1980 occurrences was their highly geometrical form and the fact that nothing quite comparable seemed to have been observed by competent scientists before that date. But life is full of enjoyable surprises, and no sensible citizen was likely to loose much sleep over this entertaining quirk of nature. RECURRING CIRCLES In 1981 three circles turned up in another field of grain near Winches- ter, about forty miles to the southeast of the 1980 occurrence. This time, we had a large central circle, flanked by two smaller circles, all three lying in a straight line. The \"swirl\" in all three circles was clockwise. UFO buffs and the British Press had a good time teasing each other. Theories began to emerge that mating hedgehogs might be responsible (perhaps even mating Brits). Responsible ufologists gathered their skirts about them. Irresponsible ufologists gave way to wonderful hypotheses, foreseeing the millenium. Responsible meteorologists be- gan to elaborate their atmospheric physics. Irresponsible armchair For- teans (including yours truly) had a quiet laugh. Then the damn thing took off ... A book will be needed to do justice to the rich eccentricities which have since overtaken us. For the moment, suffice it to say that every year has brought us a new surprise. Shortly after Dr. Meaden noted in his Journal that only clockwise \"swirls\" had so far appeared, we began to get anti- clockwise swirls. Then some learned clown sagely suggested that only \"simple\" patterns were in question â immediately, we began to stumble across ringed circles, double-ringed circles, circles arranged in an equilat- eral triangle, quintuplets of circles, circles arranged in a quadrangle, and a triangular equilateral array embrac- ing a ringed circle. As Charles Fort would have joyously predicted, hypotheses began to flow by the bucketful. Wiltshire, the county mainly blessed with these visitations, is rich in folklore, neolithic remains, rumors of the second coming of King Arthur, latter-day Druids in search of the summer solstice at Stonehenge, that fabulous intergalactic landing- ground at Warminster, .our own mag- ical UFO-maestro Arthur Shut- tlewood, and a multitude of Army helicopters. In addition to hedgehogs, people began to blame elves, pixies, \"earth forces\", witchcraft, \"Dragon lines\", unspeakable stoneage practi- ces and, of course, the military. One national newspaper perpetrated a hoax in the hope of catching out another national newspaper. Somebody sug- gested that vixens might be making nests for their cubs. It was mainly the Journal Of Meteorology that kept us sane. Dr. Meaden was able to dem- onstrate that helicopters could not be the source of these very precise patt- erns of damage; and his meticulous measurement of something like 300 of the 400 or so circles which have so far been reported entirely rules out the hypothesis of hoax in most cases. CONTROVERSY But what on earth has this got to do with respectable ufology? Quite possibly nothing ... Over here we're in the middle of one of those fratrici- dal rows which make ufology so enjoyable to Fortean onlookers. Right from the start BUFORA was very carefully â and I'm sure rightly â distanced itself from jokey Press attempts to ascribe the thing to Little Green Men. In 1986 BUFORA pub- lished a booklet by Paul Fuller and Jenny Randies which carefully exam- ined all the evidence available up to MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"My own hunch is that the corn circles are one of the most interesting anomalies to have turned up in recent years. They are clearly generated by some sort of transient energy. the autumn of the previous year. It reached no conclusion but leaned strongly towards meteorology and heavily away from LGM. In the other camp Colin Andrews and Pat Del- gado, who have spent a vast amount of time and effort in field research and aerial reconaissance, have been publishing a series of fascinating arti- cles in Flying Saucer Review, stress- ing the peculiar tendency of at least some circles to turn up in what you might call \"UFO-haunted\" country. To Fortean outsiders the ensuing, and increasingly passionate, polemics between these protagonists has proved nearly as enjoyable as the pheno- menon itself. In MUFON UFO Journal No. 234 of October 1987 you gave house- room to a letter from Jenny Randies in which she indignantly swung her handbag at the supposed UFO con- nection. (Some days I feel that, for Jenny, the magic is beginning to go out of UFOs). In the May/June 1988 issue of International UFO Reporter Paul Fuller sadly reflected on the gul- libility of ufologists when confronted with all these corny goings-on in corn fields. And while I was flying about . Hampshire and Wiltshire earlier this year, taking excited photographs of increasingly complex patterns in the fields, a celebrated ufologist I hap- pened to be with (author of a best- seller, indeed) remarked that support for the Extraterrestrial Hypoth- esis wasn't going to be found by wast- ing our time on this sort of thing. Very strange, I thought ... We've all been praying for years for something â anything â which we could go and measure, and photograph, and argue with good scientists about â and the moment it turns up, several highly intelligent ufologists rush away from it in panic! And it isn't as though we yet have an explanation for the circles in terms of current scientific paradigms. Wonderful work MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 has been done year after year by Dr. Terence Meaden, and nobody who wants to study the phenomenon can afford to be without his series of arti- cles in The Journal Of Meteorology. But I don't think I'm misrepresenting him when I say that the phenomenon continues to surprise a scientist of even his caliber (particularly by its versatile ability to generate new patt- erns, year by year); and that we are still some way from anything approach- ing a full explanation in terms of con- ventional atmospheric physics. So where do we stand? My own hunch is that the com circles are one of the most interesting anomalies to have turned up in recent years. They are clearly generated by some sort of transient energy. Whether the study of this energy \"belongs\" to meteorol- ogy, or ufology, or even the Society for Phychical Research (one of whose distinguished members is taking a close interest) or even, perhaps, to all three! â will emerge in due time. Much light may be cast on all three fields of enquiry as a result. The only inexcusable thing would be to look the other way, or to pretend that it isn't happening or doesn't matter. I'll merely end with two points. First, we â on this side of the Atlan- tic â will probably go on calling them \"corn\" circles: \"corn\" has a nice mythological ring for the anthropolo- gists and folklorists among us (and it so happens that the circles have in fact tended to turn up mainly in fields of grain â oats, wheat, rye, barley â for which we Brits use the generic term \"corn\"). Secondly, the subject now urgently needs a comprehensive bibliography.

SUPPORT UFO RESEARCH The God Hypothesis By Dr.Barry H. Downing Rev. Downing is the author of The Bible and Flying Saucers, recently scheduled for reprinting. At the end of my article, \"UFOs and Religion: The French Connec- tion,\" in the June issue of the Jour- nal, I asked the question: \"Could UFOs be a manifestation of the God of the Universe? At this point it would only be a hypothesis, of course.\" In this article I will explore why we need the God hypothesis in our cur- rent UFO context. As a Presbyterian Pastor I get asked to perform many wedding ceremonies. I occasionally get a call from a couple who obviously has never darkened the door of a church in their lives â but they want to get married in a church. They really don't care what kind of God I believe in, or what my theology is, as long as I \"do the job.\" After the wedding ceremony is over, they will never darken the door of a church again (at least while alive). For over fifteen years I have been a theological and religious consultant to MUFON, and it has been a task I have enjoyed. My task has been seen 10 by most as of marginal importance. After all, MUFON is an independent organization devoted to the scientific study of UFOs, it is not a religious organization. The UFO subject has been seen by most MUFON members to be an essentially scientific animal with a few religious warts. My job has been to explain the religious warts, if I could. If I couldn't it wouldn't matter much, because the apparently religious warts would probab- ly turn out to be scientific in the end anyway. In recent times, the religious wart has grown. A few MUFON readers may begin to\\ wonder more carefully what kind of a theological consultant the MUFON UFO Journal has. Is one enough? Do we need more than one brand? Do we really want this guy in charge of the UFO-religion marriage? I leave it to the MUFON board of directors to ponder these questions, while I try to the best of my ability to describe how the reli- gious UFO wart looks to me. In his introduction to the June 1988 issue of the Journal, editor Dennis Stacy says, \"Science and technology, religion and magic, would seem to be separate pigeonholes and never the twain shall meet.\" But in the June issue they do meet. Stacy says \"We're not aiming to make converts here to any particular cause, but rather to referee what otherwise might be considered an unwieldy con- test between opponents who don't usually square off in the same ring.\" Stacy's disclaimer of \"not aiming to make converts\" is one hint of how religion makes the study of UFOs even more uncomfortable than it already is. Few readers of the Journal would want it to become an advocate for a Roman Catholic, or Methodist, or Presbyterian, or Hindu, or Jewish, or Islamic view of UFOs, whatever that might be. I would say that the Journal would do well to imitate the United States Constitution in its policy on religion: make no laws regarding the estab- lishment of religion, nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof. That is to say, no one religious view should be the dominant or \"established\" view of the Journal, but at the same time I would not want to see the Journal exclude discussion of the religious issues in regard to UFOs from its pages. STRANGE BEDFELLOWS The fact that UFOs are now more openly admitted to have a religious dimension is due in a sense to the MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"growing confidence among MUFON members that UFOs are a legitimate scientific problem. This may seem like a strange observation. But in the early years of UFO stu- dies, those who took the UFO phe- nomenon seriously had to contend with the view of scientists like Cor- nell's Dr. Carl Sagan and the late Harvard astronomer Dr. Donald Menzel, who argued that UFOs were not really a scientific problem, they were some form of modem religious myth. These arguments advanced by scien- tists, together with the \"lunatic fringe\" of ufology, the contactees who went around giving us messages from the \"space brothers,\" made those who took UFOs seriously from a scientific point of view want to keep religion as far from the UFO debate as possible. But with the developing data base of UFO reports, the excellent scien- tific work of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, and Dr. Jacques Vallee among others, together with mounting evidence of a world-wide lie by governments to deny the existence of UFOs (see Fawcett and Greenwood, Clear Intent, Randies, The UFO Conspiracy, and Good, Above Top Secret), UFO researchers now have the confidence to believe that UFOs are a real scien- tific animal, and perhaps we ought to look more closely at the religious warts on this animal â they may be an important clue in solving the scientific puzzle. From my point of view, this is both good news and bad news. The good news is that my warts are now going to get more serious attention. The bad news is, the wart is bigger than I wish it were. UFOs, of course, are still not seen as a \"religious problem\" by most UFO writers, though there are those who already worry about the possibil- ity. Thus Jerome Clark, in his article \"Ufologists and the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis,\" is critical of Jenny Ran- dies for admitting that she is inter- ested in UFOs in part because she hopes UFOs \"will change the world and maybe help us get out of the mess we are in.\" Clark says, \"To the overwhelming majority of ufologists, the investiga- tion of the UFO phenomenon is not anything remotely like a religious MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 245, October 1988 pursuit.\" I would not want to argue with Clark about what may be the motives of those studying UFOs. What I would want to say to Clark, however, is that UFOs have a huge religious dimension, and it is important that we be allowed to take this dimension out of the closet. I would also say that if Jenny Randies wants to admit in pub- lic that she has a kind of messianic hope in regard to UFOs, she ought to be able to admit this without ridicule. Clark's closing paragraph is inter- esting. He argues that many people are afraid of dealing with \"CE3s, abductions and the ETH\" because they are seeking \"a comfortable, non- threatening alternative which reas- sures them that human beings and their gods are still the lords of this earth.\" RELIGIOUS DIMENSIONS I hope Mr. Clark recognizes the religious dimensions of this closing statement. Our emerging UFO sce- nario, including the abduction phe- nomenon, is that the UFO reality seems to be acting in a god-like way toward humans. That is, UFO beings can abduct humans, can control our minds, may take sperm samples from us, impregnate women, and appar- ently carry out breeding experiments with us. In other words, as Jacques Vallee has argued in Dimensions, UFOs are a control system. They carry on many of the functions the Judeo-Christian tradition used to ascribe to God. Our culture as a whole has little idea that many in the UFO field now believe UFOs are acting in a god-like way in regard to planet earth. The government lie about UFOs has kept the media, and therefore our religious institutions, from carrying on the reli- gious debate that the UFO concept demands. Let us make no mistake about how revolutionary an idea this will be to our religious institutions (and by our, I mean the Judeo-Christian tradition, the main religion of Western culture and of America). When Copernicus and Galileo sug- gested that the sun, not the earth, was the center of our solar systems, the idea was seen as a huge threat to the Roman Catholic faith. Yet, when we think about the basis of the Bibli- cal religion, the location of the sun in the sky is really a minor issue. Likewise, Fundamentalist Protestant- ism is still battling Darwin's theory of evolution. Darwin does not fit well with a literal reading of Genesis. Roman Catholics and liberal Protest- ants have been willing to read Gene- sis in a more metaphorical way, and so Darwin did not cause a great crisis for these \"brands\" of western religion. But the emerging concept of UFOs as the controlling force directing life on earth, as Vallee argues in Dimen- sions, a force developing our religious belief systems, is a concept which cuts right to the core of Western reli- gious faith. If Copernicus and Darwin could register a seven on the religious Richter Scale, I cannot imagine what numbers we need to read the scale of religious revolution that will take place when the rest of the world catches up with current UFO studies. On behalf of the Fund for UFO Research, Dr. Thomas E. Bullard compiled a study of over 400 pages entitled, Comparative Analysis of UFO Abduction Reports. Bullard argues that the typical abduction victim goes through a sequence of eight stages: 1) Capture, 2) Examination, 3) Con- ference, 4) Tour, 5) Otherworldly Journey, 6) Theophany, 7) Return, 8) Aftermath. He defines number 6, Theophany, as follows: \"The witness has a reli- gous experience or receives a mes- sage from a divine being.\" One of the most famous theophari- ies in UFO literature is the story of Betty Andreasson, reported by Ray- mond Fowler in The Andreasson Affair, and The Andreasson Affair: Phase II. In this abduction report Betty Andreasson confronts a being who seems to speak with the author- ity of God. How are we to interpret this aspect of the UFO phenomenon? Here are some possibilities: 1) We can put forth the hypothesis that all UFO abduction reports are mysterious psy- chological experiences, and the theo- phany in these reports is simply one aspect of the whole psychological 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"// Copernicus and Darwin could register a seven on the religious Richter Scale, I cannot imagine what numbers we need to read the scale of reli- gious revolution that will take place when the rest of the world catches up with current UFO studies. process. 2) We can suppose that much of the UFO abduction report is real, but the theophany aspect of the report is a kind of natural human psychological response elicited by being in the presence of this frightful being (see Whitley Strieber's reaction in Communion). 3) We can suppose that all of the abduction experience is real, and that the theophany is caused deliberately by the UFO beings, whoever they are, but their motive in presenting us with this theophany is deceptive: They want to give us the appearance of being God, but they are not God. This is essentially R.L. Dione's argument in God Drives a Flying Saucer. More serious UFO researchers, like John Keel and Jacques Vallee, are fearful that UFOs are influencing our religious beliefs for motives we would not like if we understood them. 4) We can suppose that UFOs are, or represent, the ultimate force behind the universe. UFOs are God, or are of God. This is the God hypothesis. This says the reason that theophanies occur in UFO abduction cases is because God is behind the abductions. This may be an unpleasant hypothe- sis. There may be insufficient evi- dence in favor of this hypothesis at present time for it to be given much weight. But for the time being, that is beside the point. My main argument for now is that the God hypothesis ought to be seen as a legitimate scientific hypothesis. We have reached the point in UFO research where it should be consi- dered along with the ETI theory, and the psychological theory, which are the main theories now under considera- tion. There is no logical reason why God might not be the ultimate case of UFO events. I realize that this is an unpleasant thought to scientists with good memories. Not long ago, the 12 idea of God was used to explain why the sun moved across the sky and why rain fell. Do we not have a right to suppose that when the real truth about UFOs is known, that once again we will find \"God\" is an unne- cessary part of the explanation? We may suppose this, but we do not know if it is true at this point. GOD CONCEPTS There are many difficulties with the God hypothesis, of course. The first problem is that when we use the term God, we are thinking in West- ern culture of the God of Judeo- Christian tradition. Islam is also an off-shoot of this tradition. Hinduism does not have a compar- able concept of God, nor does Bud- dhism which grew out of Hinduism. Foster Morrison, in his article \"UFOs â Science and Technology in the Service of Magic,\" in the June issue of the Journal, says that \"The uni- verse of UFOs is animistic. Exotic celestial beings travel from world to world. Life is everywhere and more diverse than in the Hindu pantheon.\" Morrison further argues that \"The Gods of the messianic faiths are sim- ilarly removed from human under- standing\" in our scientific culture, in which science is our real religion, religion having the function of justify- ing \"the prevailing political and social system.\" Thus from Morrison's point of view, Western religion, which is mes- sianic, is of little use either in our current scientific culture, or in under- standing UFOs. Morrison has arrived at this con- clusion in part because he has not traced the God of Western culture back to its two roots. Our idea of God is partly formed by the Greek philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, who saw God not so much as person as prime mover, or as being itself. This idea of God was blended by theologians like Aquinas with biblical theology, the theology of a God who made man in his own image, a biblical tradition in which angels flew down from the sky, met with humans, intervened with \"chosen people\" like Moses and Jesus, Messiahs who saved us from Egypt or death. Thus Western religion, messianic religion, is by no means by-passed by our emerging UFO stories. Part of Jerome Clark's fear is that some kind of new messianic faith will emerge from UFO studies. Jenny Randies hoping that UFOs will \"help us get out of the mess we are in\" may be only the tip of the iceberg. Whitley Strieber is clearly fearful of the messianic dimensions of the UFO story. In his Forword to Vallee's Dimensions, Strieber says, \"The only thing now needed to make the UFO myth a new religion of remarkable scope and force is a single undeniable sighting. Such a sighting need last only a few minutes â just long enough to be thoroughly documented. It will at once invest the extraterres- trials channels, the 'space brothers' believers, and the UFO cultists with the appearance of revealed truth.\" Vallee shares Strieber's fear that we humans will be too quick to believe. I would not deny that there is huge potential for fanaticism in the UFO concept. Furthermore, if Strieber's \"one undeniable sighting\" were to occur, Christian fundamentalists would undoubtedly assume that the Second Coming of Christ is here. John Wei- don and Zola Levitt's UFOs: What on Earth is Happening? has already led the way in that direction. Let us suppose that the govern- ments of the world are not as dumb as we in the UFO field have been inclined to think. Jerome Clark, Jac- ques Vallee and Whitley Strieber all see tremendous danger in linking UFOs and religion. They see a fright- ening potential for social disaster. That is undoubtedly one of the main reasons our government has lied to us about UFOs. Like Clark, Vallee and Strieber, they fear social and religious disaster if UFO informa- tion is released. At the same time, Foster Morrison MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"has argued rightly \"The only identifi- able thing the UFO phenomenon is doing is discrediting the scientific and political establishments.\" I have argued that the UFO phe- nomenon, through the \"pillar of cloud and fire\" during the Exodus, in the same way discredited the scientific and political establishment of Pha- raoh's Egypt, and likewise the resur- rection of Jesus discredited the Roman political and Jewish religious estab- lishment of his time. I believe that the humbling of the established powers that UFOs are now bringing about has occurred before. And although Jenny Randies may not have a lot of evidence to support her hope that UFOs may \"help us get out of the mess we are in,\" at the same time what are we to make of stories like those reported by Fawcett and Greenwood in Clear Intent, in which UFOs hover above our nuclear silos, and reprogram the computers in the warheads? Is it not possible that UFOs have used their power to cause the political and scientific powers of the world to rethink their nuclear strategy? If so, is this messianic activity God-like activity? I think we need the God hypothe- sis. At the very least, many reports indicate that UFOs are behaving in a God-like way toward life on planet earth. Speaking as a Christian, I have to say that UFOs create a huge problem for my theology if they are not God- directed. UFOs are reported in the Bible that are very similar to modern UFOs. Furthermore, modern UFOs, and their occupants, are report- ed to control human minds, and human speech (in the manner of Pen- tecost, Acts, chapter 2), they can control human reproduction, and there- fore all biological development; reports indicate that they can distort time as well as space. They have the power to heal human diseases, to overpower human technology, and to confound the political and scientific powers of the world. Jacques Vallee has argued in Dimensions that the main purpose of UFOs is to control our religious belief systems. The God of the Bible is known by his ability to do all these things. I know of nothing in my theolo- gical training that gives me the ability to distinguish between the work of God, and the work of the UFO real- ity. If UFOs are not of God, where is my God, and how am I to know Him? We need the God hypothesis because I don't think the governments of the world can keep the UFO lie going forever. It would be better for all of us if the God hypothesis could be discussed before world governments release their UFO information. This way the discussion could occur in a more rational atmosphere, rather than in the face of the fear that those like Whitley Strieber obviously felt so deeply. At this point we need to raise the God hypothesis in a scientific way. I say in a scientific way because the religious community is too fearful to explore this concept in even a preli- minary fashion at this point. But the UFO community, as a scientific broth- erhood, can ask the theoretical ques- tion: If there is a God in the universe, and if this God were to be the cause of the UFO phenomenon, how would we know it? This question is only a slight extension of the basic question we are all asking: Who are these guys, and what do they want? The Need For Skeptics By Michael J. Rigg Rigg is a MUFON state section director for Indiana. What does UFO investigation need most of all? The answer may surprise you â skeptics! That's right, skep- tics. It should be obvious to field investigators and trainees who have read the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual that blind acceptance of the UFO phenomenon is just as danger- ous to UFOlogy as blatant debunking. Debunkers are dangerous to UFOlo- gists because they can wrongly influ- ence the UFO outsiders who are already slightly skeptical. Then they, in turn, become debunkers them- selves. Blind acceptors of the UFO phenomenon tend to feed on tabloid stories of three-headed monsters from Mars and fantasize brothers-from- MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 space stories about pyramid builders, all out of proportion, without consid- ering known facts, fallacies and tru- isms. Between these two radically dif- ferent stands comes a difficult zone of skepticism and belief. Two believ- ing types are those who accept anal- ysis of UFO physical trace sightings, hypnotic recall, multiple witness reports, etc., and those who accept the hypo- theses of noted UFO writers. The lat- ter differ from blind acceptors in the respect that blind acceptors usually form their own hypotheses and gener- ally refuse to listen to others no mat- ter what their credentials. I have formulated this discovery (of the four basic UFO belief types) since joining MUFON and listening to those inside â and why they joined â and those outside â why they would like to join. One thing we should keep in mind is that what a potential investi- gator's \"belief type\" is is just as important as having UFO sightings typed and categorized. These four basic types are 1) The blind acceptor, 2) The hypothesizer, 3) The Analyzer, and 4) The Rejec- tor. All of the following anecdotal information and theory comes from having discussed UFOs with people of varying backgrounds. I find this type system important because, as I mentioned earlier, some ways of thought may be detrimental to the study of the UFO phenomenon. TYPE ONE, The Blind Acceptor: One blatant Type One that I have had the misfortune to meet was fond of philosophizing about the origins of the pyramids, the Devil's Triangle, 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"and man himself. Now, the one thing about the Type One that I want to make perfectly clear is that they do not change their minds and cannot be swayed no matter what the evi- dence, or no matter how obvious something may seem. The Type One I talked to had the following to say about IFOs: I happened to be relating a story about an F-86 jet fighter that was rocketing after a UFO that had sud- denly appeared over the horizon. I mentioned to this person that although there have been real UFO/jet \"dogfight\" incidents, this time the pilot was actually trying to attack the planet Venus! To this the Type One replied, \"How do you know it was the planet Venus?\" to which I responded, \"It was docu- mented as such, and the position of the light followed the exact path of Venus and was seen on consecutive nights!\" To this the Type One adam- antly replied, \"That's no proof!\" If that isn't proof, then I don't know what is. It is important for investigators to keep a calm realiza- tion that well over 85 percent of their investigators may turn out to be IFO encounters like the one I just des- cribed. As far as skepticism goes, Type Ones lose out because they have not one skeptical bone in their bodies. TYPE TWO, The Hypothesizes I don't mean here to suggest that \"hypothesizer\" refers to \"one who hypothesizes.\" On the contrary, the Type Two believes in UFOs and in addition may collect and accept more than one hypothesis about their origin or existence. The Type Two person is a walking library of UFO lore and can reproduce practically any close encounter case verbatim. The danger this type presents rests in his or her reluctance to engage in free thinking. The Type Twos I have met can talk all day about UFOs, but if I were to ask, \"Well, what's your opinion?\" the question draws a blank. I was amazed to find that happened four out of five times I conversed with Type Twos. As far as becoming an investigator goes, Type Twos may have trouble discerning what a witness says with 14 what he/she has read that sounds familiar. One Type Two that I have met (who IS an investigator) became extremely disheartened when his first case turned out to be an IFO. Type Twos must realize that not everyone they interview is going to become the next Whitley Strieber, Betty An- dreasson, or Barney Hill. Once this obstacle is overcome, any Type Two could be molded into a fine informa- tion gatherer. All Type Twos lack is a sprinkling of skepticism in the right place; they gear too far toward the dark, \"unknown\" end of the spec- trum without checking the light side. TYPE THREE, The Analyzer: This is the perfect UFO investigator. Just as the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual suggests, this person is a conscientious hard worker who holds off on making snap judgments or hypotheses which can't be proven anyway, and concentrates instead on gathering the facts into reasonable form without emphasizing one point over another. A Type Three will go into a case without guessing before- hand what the sighting may turn out to be. A Type Three will weigh each case evenly, keeping in mind that CE- I may be an IFO, a CE-II may be fungi growth, and a CE-III or IV may be an overactive imagination. The Type Three may have an idea or two about where UFOs come from, how they work, etc., but he/she would never let that get in the way of progress. Above all, the Type Three must remain skeptical enough to remain serious without getting excited when a case surfaces. TYPE FOUR, The Rejector: All UFOlogists have run into these at one point or another. Whether it's a stubborn acquaintance, an opponent at a public debate, or just a famous UFO debunker between the pages of a book, we've all had the misfortune of meeting them. Type Fours are the enemies of serious UFO study, the Klasses and Menzels, and the pre- 1969 Air Force project Blue Book lackeys. These rejectors live for the weather balloon, and go out of their way (even to the point of construct- ing fake UFO projects that are actu- ally debunking machines) to under- mine UFOlogical study. Ray Fowler, author of The Andreasson Affair, has some good books that deal in part with Type Four run-ins. I recommend Casebook of a UFO Investigator and UFOs: Interplanetary Visitors. As Mr. Fowler puts it (and he puts it much beter than I), the best way to handle these people is to simply know what you are talking about. As long as you are sure about what you are doing, there is absolutely no rea- son to fear the opinions of Type Fours. So, the final analysis is simple. Type Three believers rate the best metal for UFO investigators. We should keep these traits in mind as we surge forward toward the ever- distant UFO. If we can sidestep the Type Ones, ignore the Type Fours, and recruit the Type Threes, UFO1- ogy may start making even larger leaps and strides than it is now. There are many good books on the shelves that can help the UFO inves- tigator become a well-oiled machine; aside from Mr. Fowler's books which I've already mentioned and the MUFON manual, try Allan Hendry's UFO Handbook. In the meantime, let's remember that keen interest is one thing, but zealous impatience is deadly. Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee (Alias \"Joe Cool\") MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Elementary My Dear Watson! By Lindy Whitehurst Geochemist Whitehurst offers the following bit of whimsy as educated speculation on the nature of a potentially alien-inhabited planet. Perhaps if in the days of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's master detective, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, UFO sightings oc- curred with late 20th century fre- quency, then his \"deductive reason- ing\" abilities may have helped to shed some light on our unearthly visitors and deduce the make-up of their planet. As you read the narrative, imagine you hear the famous voice of the cinema Holmes, Basil Rathbone. Now let us place ourselves in the mind of Mr. Holmes and reach across time and light years of intersteller space to look in on an alien world. \"I bid you greetings my dear reader from Victorian England. I have been requested to review the facts in this case, use my humble powers of deduction, and report my findings. First let me remind you of the aliens' 'modus operandi'. Great consisten- cies in reporting details of the huma- noids by hundreds of witnesses for decades of your century have pro- vided us with biological benchmarks from which to make our deductions: 1) Short slender bodies, 2) Large hair- less heads in proportion to their bodies, 3) Very large black slanted eyes, 4) Small nostrils without notice- able nose bridge, 5) Thin close-fitting suits, 6) Seldom an audible speech, 7) Medical examinations repeatedly per- formed, 8) Predominantly nocturnal sightings, 9) Quick movements ob- served, 10) Comparatively low physi- cal strength ... And now the game is a foot. \"My friend and associate, Inspector Lastrade of Scotland Yard, an ama- teur anthropologist, tells me since elements and compounds needed for life occur in meteorites, stars, and galactic dust, we may assume the MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 chemistry for life elsewhere may be very similar to our own and subject to the same physical laws. Intelligent life should be mammalian because it takes a long time for intelligence to be transmitted to offspring, and mammals are the only form we know of that take care of their young for long periods of time.\" \"I've noted since helmets are rarely observed, we can assume they feel comfortable in your proportional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, cleaner I dare say than the soot we British breathe from our industrialization era, and it follows they must have an ample supply of oxygen-producing plants and life-sustaining fresh water. Our earth comprises only one per- cent fresh water; the other 99 per- cent being in the salt water oceans. If we assume nature allows only a small fraction of fresh water on planets capable of sustaining life, then great salted oceans and continents would also be expected. Fresh water is formed when water vapor continually evaporating from the world's oceans forms clouds, and carried by the winds causes fresh water to fall on the land to be collected and used by its inhabitants. We would expect weather cycles on a life-bearing alien planet not be greatly different from our own and will henceforth use our own carbon-based human form as a reference point from which to 'evolve' their planet. Silicon-based life forms would be a somewhat remote possi- bility due to much longer evolution time. \"Although our respective civiliza- tions may have begun along different evolutionary tracks, they also eventu- ally converged toward the approxi- mate humanoid form though they need not resemble the human body too closely. Other intelligently-evolved species would naturally differ because of the enormous number of chance combinations of nucleotides in the DNA structure with respect to the environment. We do, of course, share the basic humanoid shape: two arms, two legs, a head, two eyes, etc., and would expect a central nervous sys- tem, a brain, sensory organs up front, and mobile with manipulative ability. Very small beings could possibly evolve intelligence provided their an- cient ancestors weren't forced to use all their energies in competition with larger and more powerful animals for survival, while a marine environment would be still less likely to evolve intelligence. \"If I may say, a key to their planet's size may indeed lie in the muscularity of their legs. While far too little is known about their lower appendages, much has been said about their skinny arms, and if we humans are to be used as an example of proportion- ality, skinny legs would almost cer- tainly follow the trend. Slender legs would indicate they don't require large muscles to comfortably walk about their native world. This would mean a lighter gravity and a corres- pondingly smaller planet than our Earth. \"The study of gravitational forces, discovered by one of my country's great fellow scientiests, Sir Issac Newton, tells us the more massive the planet, the heavier the gravity, and conversely the smaller the world, the lighter is its gravity, with slighter muscles needed to walk about. Too large a planet, possibly over twice the size of the Earth, with high surface gravity, would evolve so strong a skeletal structure for compensation as to make sluggish creatures. \"Our slightly-built aliens, however, would find our heavier gravity some- what of a burden unless artifically overcome, and after all, we do find numerous reports of aliens apparently using an artificial device to float themselves along as well as their human captives. 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PLANETARY PARAMETERS \"Your nineteenth century American astronomer and expert on the planet Mars, Percival Lowell, reminded me if their world is a bit too small like Mars (one-third the earth's gravity), it would not have had sufficient gravity to hold down its air and water; they would have boiled away, and the air would have become too thin to support intelligent life as has been theorized for our red neighbor in space. Our requirements are for water as a sol- vent with an oxidizing atmosphere. We may choose to speculate the measurements of an alien world for light-gravity humanoids as somewhere between that of Mars and of the Earth. Going to any astronomy handbook, picking a diameter and gravity in the middle of the two, and applying simple physics formulas to the rest allows us some working estimates. I direct your attention to the accompanying chart. \"Our earth is about 150 million kilometers, (93 million miles) from the sun, our star, but it would be difficult to make a good guess at the distance of an alien world from its sun because stars have different sizes and therefore varying comfort zones (dis- tances a planet revolving about its sun must be in order to provide a comfortable temperature to promote life). If a planet is too close, such as Mercury, tidal friction could syn- chronize or greatly diminish its rota- tion, alternately freezing and frying its surface. Basic metals would exist only in melted liquid form, and water would not exist. If a planet is too far away, its water would exist in frozen form. We can't place a numerical fig- ure on distance from its parent sun, but we may be able to determine, relative to the earth, if they live on a world that is generally warmer or colder than ours. \"Our Astronomer Royal tells us 86 percent of all known stable \"Main- Sequence\" stars in the heavens are less luminous than our sun, and this may at least statistically say our vis- itors may come from a smaller star whose surface temperature would be cooler than our sun's (below 5,600 degrees Celsius) and would have a smaller warm 'comfort zone' about it. 16 DIAMETER: 9780 km (6080 miles) GRAVITY: 67 percent of earth's CIRCUMFERENCE: 30,700 km (19,100 miles) DENSITY: 4.8 grams / cubic centimeter or 87 percent of earth's VOLUME: 45 percent of earth's MASS: 39 percent of earth's This would probably leave room only for one habitable planet in their solar system. Large hot massive stars in the 'O, B, and A' spectral classes rapidly exhaust their energies and extinguish long before planetary civil- izations have a chance to develop, while 'M, N, R, and S' classes are too small with very narrow habitable comfort zones. That leaves the 'F, G, and K' classes of stars more nearly like our own sun, indicating their sun's color would range from yellow- white to yellow to orange. This would effectively eliminate hotter blue and white stars and the cooler red stars. Within the 'acceptable' 'F, G, and K spectral classes, taking into consideration a smaller, cooler sun, statistics reveal the aliens' home star could have a diameter as small as 65% of our sun's or about 900,000 kilometers (560,000 miles). \"Most of all stars in the sky are binary or multiple and should be ruled out because planet orbits would not likely be stable enough to keep them in a thermally habitable zone. Variable stars should also not be considered because of their drasti- cally changing radiation levels. Your future planetary scientists have spec- ulated Mars Venus could lie just inside our larger sun's 'habitable zone' and could have possibly pro- duced intelligent life if not for their extremely thin and dense atmos- pheres respectively. JOLLY DIM & BLOODY COLD? \"Most outstanding of all are the large slanted eyes. For a dark planet receiving less sunlight, and thus colder than the earth because it is com- paratively further from its sun than we are, evolution would have stepp- ed in to provide dimly-lit people with larger eyes to absorb more light and thus to function adequately in build- ing a civilization. Their eyes appear able to work well in bright examina- tion rooms, as ours accustom themselves to well- lit hospital operating rooms, witness the oft-reported bright (and cold) interiors of their ships. \"A different view may suggest their planet has a denser atmosphere than ours, screening out more sunlight and ultraviolet rays and thus giving them large eyes. In this case, the planet may be farther from its sun yet still allow its denser atmosphere to act like a greenhouse and trap more warmth. Lungs and thorax regions would be smaller with no need to develop larger lungs with which to breathe a thinner air. This scenario would seem less likely, however, than the small, cold, thin-air planet theory. Noting the aliens' obvious lack of muscles indicates a smaller world whose lesser gravity would be less cap- able of retaining a large dense atmos- phere and creating a greenhouse effect. One abductee was told if she stayed in their ship she would become ill in about 30 minutes, as if their craft's natural atmospheric pressure was thin like a high mountain top which causes nausea after a period of time. Still, ship air is sometimes reported as thick and heavy. \"In contemplating the large hairless heads of our friends, biologists repeat- edly tell us the human race will reach a similar large shaped head configura- tion in the far distant future.

These trends lead us to believe we are dealing with a civilization not just a few hundred or a few thousand years ahead of us, but one probably in excess of 100,000 years.

If faster- than-light travel has indeed been invented, whether it be by sheer speed, traveling the short cut through curved space, or whatever treats your fancy, why should we limit their effective speed to perhaps 10% fas- ter?

I bid you farewell and God's speed.\" Magnetic Analysis of Car Lifts By Robert H. Willsey MUFON member Willsey also belongs to the Los Angeles UFO Research Group (LAUFORG). At this writing, detailed accounts of three car lifts are available to me; the Burk car lift in Pennsylvania, the Winscher car lift in Missouri, and the Knowles family car lift in Australia. This analysis is based most directly upon the Burk case due to the follow- ing reasons: 1) An estimate of the distance between the UFO and the vehicle at the time of lifting is available. 2) An estimate of the diameter of the UFO is also available. 3) The automobile headlights flickered on and off in this incident; therefore establishment of the operative field lifting this car would then also provide an estimate of the threshold for shutting off headlights. The Burk case is well described in Reference 1, and the Winscher case is well in documented in Reference 2. Five additional car lift cases are cata- logued in Reference 3. This analysis is based upon the hypothesis that the force which lifted MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 these cars, the Burk car in particular, is the same magnetic force well known to physicists and electrical engineers. Earlier research has consi- dered the possibility that certain other UFO effects were due to an electromagnetic field. These effects include the formation of Ruppelt rings (4), heating of finger rings (5, 6), mal- functioning of radios (7), and the stopping of cars (3, 8), among others. The idea that many of these effects are due to electromagnetic fields associated with the UFO has been ' around for a long time, almost from 1947, as pointed out by Keith Baster- field (9). Having chosen the Burk case for analysis, a car similar to her 1976 Chevrolet Malibu was located and weighed. The nearly horizontal metal surface areas of the roof, trunk and hood were measured as a possible magnetic lifting surface and the total area was found to be about 8000 square inches. The weight of the car was a little more than 3200 pounds. Dividing these numbers easily estab- lishes that a lifting force of only 0.4 pounds per square inch are required to lift all four wheels off the ground. There are some similarities in the Burk and Winscher cases. In both the UFO did not touch the car as happened in Australia, and only two of the wheels were lifted from the ground, two side wheels in the Burk case and two rear wheels in the Winscher case. The indentations oh the rear of the Winscher automobile may indicate that the UFO did touch that car, and may even be the means by which the car was lifted. The latter possibility is another reason the Burk case was chosen for analysis. It is believed that in all three cases the UFO was directly above the car when it was lifted. In the Australian case the UFO probably sat on the car. ATTRACTIVE Since at least in both the Burk and Winscher cases the UFO was above the car when it was lifted, let us assume that a magnetic dipole, with its axis vertical, is contained within the UFO. This dipole could be direct- acting with either the north-seeking 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"pole or the south-seeking pole at the bottom, closest to the automobile, and in either case the force upon the vehicle on the ground would be attracting or upward. Instead of being direct, the dipole could be oscillating back and forth in polarity at a low frequency, and the lifting effect upon the automobile would still be attrac- tive or upward. The attracting effect of an alternating field is not obvious, even to electrical engineers. To better establish this low frequency AC field attraction effect, a direct quotation from Reference 10 is presented: \"The limitatioins of alternating-cur- rent magnets as compared to direct- current magnets, operating with the same maximum flux density, are summarized as follows: \"1) Force Limitation. For a given pole face area, the average force on alternating current is only one-half that obtained with direct current. This applies to both single and poly- phase operation. \"2) Weight Limitation. For a given force and 'stroke the alternating- current magnet will be much heavier than the direct-current one because (a) at least twice as much iron must be used to develop the same force and (b) generally more copper is required to carry the large reactive power for alternating-current operation. \"3) Volt-ampere Limitation. (Not pertinent.) \"4) Speed of Action. (Six non- pertinent lines omitted.) In general, a direct-current magnet can be designed to accomplish the same work in the same time with a smaller peak volt- ampere input than on alternating current.\"* The point to emphasize from the above quotation is that an alternating low frequency electromagnetic field can have as much attractive force upon ferromagnetic material like a car body as a direct field. The details of the amount of iron and copper used in generating fields in conven- tional electromagnets does not apply to UFOs. In fact, UFOs probably do not use iron or copper at all in generating their magnetic fields due to their finite losses. To calculate the strength of the mag- netic field required to lift Burk's or Winscher's car, use is made of equa- 18 The principal point is that the magnetic lifting force exerted upon automobiles by UFOs in car lift cases could be direct-acting fields or low frequency alternating fields. tion (13-7) from reference 11. B 2 A 2Uo where F is the force generated in newtons, B is the flux density in tes- las, A is the area in square meters and Uo is the permeability of free space. When the 8000 square inches of body lifting area are converted to square meters, and the car weight of 3200 pounds is converted first into kilograms and then into newtons and these values are plugged into the equation, one can then solve for B. The result is B = .0833 tesla or 833 gauss. Page 424 of reference 10 has an equation which permits use of the weight in pounds and the area in square inches. B 2 Average Force = Ibs. per sq. in. 72 The above equation is the average useful force generated by an AC low frequency magnetic field. The pounds per square inch are simply 3200 divided by 8000 or 0.400. B is the r.m.s. flux density in kilomaxwells per square inch. B 2 = 72 x 0.400 = 28.8. B = the square root of 28.8 = 5.367 kilomaxwells per square inch. To compare with the earlier result we must convert to maxwells per square inch and then to teslas. B - 5.367 x 1000 = 5367) maxwells per square inch. Next we divide by 6.452 to convert to maxwells per square centimeter. 5367 divided by 6.452 = 832 maxwells per square centimeter = 832 gauss. Dividing by 10,000 converts gauss to teslas. The result is .0832 teslas, which is very close to the previous result (.0833 teslas). A fellow ufologist suggests the equations used here are too simple to accurately represent such a complex situation as magnetic lifting of an automobile so he has performed some calculations of his own. He took the case of a magnetic dipole directly over a large hunk of soft iron, representing a UFO over an automo- bile. He wrote the vector equations for the force between the dipole's magnetic moment and the magnetic moment induced into the iron, and expanded the vector equation into a vector matrix equation. Considering the magnetic properties of soft iron, the distance between the dipole and the iron, he derived equations for the force acting upward on the iron for both unsaturated and saturated cases. He used the same car weight, 1453 kilo- grams that I used above and a dis- tance of separation of 5 meters. Solv- ing for the magnetic flux density B he found 1115 gauss or .1115 tesla. (12) These results are pretty close together and support each other. As an example, if 1115 gauss is considered to be the correct answer, then 833 gauss is only 25% too low. All the above calculations produce results which are just sufficient to raise all four wheels off the ground, however in both the Burk and Winscher cases only two wheels were lifted off the ground. For only two wheels the magnetic flux density required is one over the square root of two or .707 times as large, and 833 gauss becomes 589 gauss. These two values set upper and lower limits between which the actual value probably lies. That is for magnetic flux densities above 833 gauss all four wheels would have been lifted, while for values below 589 gauss none of the wheels would have been lifted. For the other derivation and calculation the corresponding lim- its are 1115 gauss for four wheels and .707 x 1115 or 788 gauss for two wheels. The average value of these MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"last two numbers, 951.5 will be rounded down to 950 gauss for use in further calculations as a most likely correct value. To calculate the magnetic moment at the disk, use is made of the height above the car of about 30 feet and the .disk diameter of 24 feet as given in the first listed reference 1. Thirty feet is about 9 meters, which becomes the value r in the equation below, taken from page 9 of reference 8. -7 2x10 M B This equation is accurate for dis- tances r which are large compared to the source size, however in this case r is only slightly larger than the source size, so the value obtained can only be considered an approxi- mation. With r equal to 9 meters and B taken as .0950 tesla (950 gauss) M works out to be 3.46 times 10 8 ampere meter 2 . The area of the disk is 42.1 square meters. Dividing yields a current of 8.2 million amperes with the assumption that a single current circulates around the perimeter of the UFO. Magnetic lifting force falls off by the fourth or seventh power of distance of separation, requiring a very close magnetic saturation occurs in the auto's metal, the fall off is to the fourth power, otherwise to the sev- enth power. In either case magnetic lifting power decreases very rapidly with increasing distance of separa- tion. This probably explains why there are many times fewer car lift cases than car interference cases reported in the literature. For instance, 5 lifts out of 441 cases in Reference 3. While this report was being pre- pared another car lift case came to my attention via Issue No. 3 of the Italian UFO Reporter December 1986. Investigator Moreno Tambellini report- ed the following incident under the lead \"The Car That 'Went Mad'\": \"On October 28th, 1986 at 6:15 p.m., a couple driving near Viareggio (Lucca) noticed a 'huge triangle- shaped object' in the sky, hovering above the harbor. It was black or MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 very dark and had four bright yellow lights. As they passed underneath, a loud 'boom' shocked their car, which 'went mad': the speed lowered from 60 to 20 kms per hour, while the engine reved up and the back side of the car was 'lifted upwards', only to fall back down again suddenly as the witnesses felt a sensation of 'void in the stomach'. Then they saw the object passing away towards the mountains. They reported their expe- rience to the Carabinieri and then suffered from headaches for some nights. A strange light in the sky was also reported at the same time to the police by anonymous callers in Via- reggio.\" SIGNIFICANCE The principal point of this paper is that the magnetic lifting force exerted upon automobiles by UFOs in car lift cases could be direct-acting fields or low frequency alternating fields. To help decide which of these two alter- natives is most likely to be true, it is necessary to consider how many other of the various reported effects of UFOs can be explained by each of these magnetic forces. Since micro- waves have been proposed as a causative factor in some of these effects it is necessary to include them in the analysis. The table below lists 11 physical effects of UFOs that have been ascribed to these three forms of electromagnetic radiation. An X in a column indicates that that particular form of radiation is well known to cause the physical effect indicated on that line. \"Char grass roots\" and \"Produce odors by heating\" are from Reference 4. Since alternating fields can do anything pulsed magnetic fields can do, X's were given to \"Induce metallic taste\" and \"Spin compass needles\" on the basis of Reference 13. Both direct and alternating mag- netic fields can lift cars, however alternating magnetic fields can per- form 7 other physical effects whereas direct magnetic fields can only pro- duce one other effect listed in this table. Since it is always desirable to explain as many physical effects as possible with the fewest hypotheses, it seems obvious that the low fre- quency alternating magnetic field is the most likely single hypothesis. Physical effects such as the 11 listed in Table I are especially inter- esting since they offer solid support for the physical reality of at least some UFOs, and since mankind is not capable of producing these effects from aerial vehicles they offer indirect support for the extraterrestrial hypoth- esis. Any cases involving such physi- cal effects are important and should be reported and published. I do not know what significance to Table I. Well Known Physical Effects Low Freq.

Gorman â a 25-year-old second lieutenant in the Air National Guard â was coming into Fargo, North Dakota from a cross-country flight. He called the control tower for landing instructions and was told that a Piper Cub was in the area. He saw the Cub below him. All of a sudden what appeared to be the tail light of another airplane passed him on his right. He called the tower and complained but they assured him that no other aircraft except the Cub were in the area. Gorman could still see the light so he decided to investigate. He pushed the F-51 over into a turn and cut in toward the light. He could plainly see the Cub outlined against the city lights below, but could see no outline of a body near the mysterious light. He gave the F-51 more power and closed to within 1,000 yards, close enough to 20 estimate that the light was six to eight inches in diameter, sharply out- lined, and blinking on and off. Suddenly the light became steady as it apparently put on power; it pulled into a sharp left bank and made a pass at the tower. The light zoomed up with the F-51 in hot pur- suit. At 7,000 feet it made a turn. Gorman followed and tried to cut inside the light's turn to get closer, but couldn't do it. The light made another turn, and this time the F-51 closed on a collision course. The UFO appeared to try to ram the F- 51, and Gorman had to dive to get out of the way. The UFO passed over his canopy with only a few feet to spare. Again both the F-51 and the object turned and closed on each other head-on, and again the pilot had to dive out to avoid a collision. All of a sudden the light began to climb and disappeared. \"I had the dis- tinct impression that its maneuvers were controlled by thought or rea- son,\" Gorman said later. Four other observers at Fargo corroborated his story, Dr. A.D. Cannon, the Piper Cub pilot, his passenger, Mr. Jensen, the senior air traffic controller, and the assistant air traffic controller. The official explanation was that Gorman was pursuing a weather bal- loon with a light attached. The weather station at Fargo had released a lighted weather balloon approxi- mately 10 minutes prior to Lt. Gor- man's call to the tower. The balloon, however, was at all times in sight by Mr. Sanderson of the weather sta- tion, moving slowly in a westerly direction at an altitude of about 500 feet. According to Mr. Jensen, the tower controller, \"The F-51 was some distance behind, and the light was traveling fast enough to increase the spacing between itself and the fighter. The main identifying characteristic (of the UFO) ... was the high rate of speed at which it was apparently traveling.\" The assistant tower controller said, \"The object seemed to be about 2,000 feet and appeared to be travel- ing at an excessive speed ...\" Dr. Cannon, the Cub's pilot stated, \"The MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"UFO was moving very swiftly, much faster than the F-51 ... I saw the light and the F-51 at the same time. The light seemed to be outside of the cir- cles made by the F-51.\" (Walt Andrus interviewed George Gorman during a private dinner when George lived in New Braunfels, Texas. Mr. Gorman is now deceased.) *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - October 1953: On the 18th two Brit- ish airline pilots, Captain Peter Fletcher and First Officer R.L. Lemon, saw a strange craft flying over the English Channel. It had the appearance of two table saucers placed together rim-to-rim. In his official report to the British Air Ministry, Captain Fletcher said, \"We have no doubt whatsoever the object was solid ... that it was constructed of metal...\" *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - October 1958: On the third, freight train number 91 on the Monon Railroad was southbound through the little town of Rossville, Indiana. At approx- imately 3:10 a.m., the fireman, Cecil Bridge, noticed a formation of four oddly glowing white lights crossing the tracks ahead of the train. The engineer saw them also. Bridge saw the lights turn and come toward the train at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet. He picked up the microphone of the radio intercom and alerted the three other crew members in the caboose. The conductor, Ed Robin- son, was in the cupola and had already spotted them. He said that the objects came as low as possibly 200 to 300 feet, and swept the length of the train. The UFOs changed color as they changed speed, from white when moving rapidly to orange or deep red when moving slowly. After traversing the entire length of the train, the objects wheeled in formation and sped away to the east, then they came rushing back and followed the train. Robinson said they were very low at times, scarcely above the tree- tops. They appeared to be about 40 feet in diameter, and 10 feet thick, MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 although no specific shape could be discerned through the glow. At one time, he said, they stood on their edges behind the train, \"looking like four sticks stuck in the ground, except the outside two leaned outward at a 45 degree angle.\" The four UFOs performed around the train for one hour and 10 minutes and all five members of the crew agreed on what they had seen and what had hap- pened. *** TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO â October 1963: At 2:30 p.m. on the 31st, residents of Iguape, in Brazil's Sao Paulo province rushed out of their homes to see a silvery, disc- shaped object surrmounted by a low dome moving overhead. The disc was obviously in difficulty, for it moved jerkily and oscillated as it went, mak- ing a heavy pounding noise. The disc lurched over the house of Mrs. Elidia de Sousa, beside the river. Barely missing the structure, the disc shot forward and gave a palm tree a glanc- ing blow. The disc then zig-zagged out over the river, losing altitude, and finally plunged into the water. Accord- ing to the report made to the Brazi- lian government, about 50 people saw the object plunge into the river, among them some local fishermen. When the water began to boil where the disc had submerged, the fishermen drove stakes into the bank to mark the spot. It had gone into water about 12 feet deep with an estimated 15 feet of soft mud on the bottom of the river. The Brazilian government rushed divers to the scene, and troops to maintain a round-the-clock watch. Other govern- ment representatives removed a sec- tion of the palm tree. Witnesses told the government investigators that the disc disappeared to be about 16 feet in diameter, with a low dome about 40 inches high. It looked, they said, like a shiny washbasin upside down. Day after day and night after night the divers searched the muddy bot- tom of the Peropava River. The Braz- ilian Navy brought various types of underwater detection gear to the spot, but after two weeks of search- ing, the project was discontinued. It was decided that the disc had either been washed downstream and lost in the mud, or that it had managed to repair itself while under water and had slipped away during the night. That it went into the water as des- cribed was accepted by the govern- ment of Brazil without doubt. But where it went after that is an unans- wered question. *** TWENTY YEARS AGO â Octob- er 1968: A 16-year-old youth, deliver- ing the Washington Post in Bethesda, Maryland, reported a UFO on the ground. The object was seen about 6 a.m. on the 24th, and described as disc-shaped with a cone-shaped pro- trusion which rested on the ground. \"It was quite large,\" he said, \"about 17 yards across the disc portion. There were alternating dim red, white and yellow lights around the center of the disc, and the object did not move. Street lights behind the park, reflecting on the disc, made it appear that it was a silver, metallic material. \"I just stood there and watched it for two or three minutes,\" he said, adding \"I had to deliver the rest of my papers and when I came back in about 20 minutes, the thing was gone.\" The carrier said he saw a hole in the ground, about two feet by a foot and a half, where the UFO had been. There was also a circular area of scorched earth, about two feet wide, surrounding the hole. \"I wasn't really scared,\" he said, \"because if there was anybody in that sophisticated object, they knew I was out there and they didn't hurt me.\" He estimated that when he first saw the object, he was standing about 150 feet away, in the street. \"I did feel kind of numb all over, just sort of stunned and I thought There's somebody else here ... that's for sure!' Our astronauts wouldn't be scared if they saw life on other planets ... maybe if they come here, they want to see what â and how â we're doing.\" *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO â Octob- er 1973: A 43-year-old woman claimed 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"she was raped in a spaceship by a being from another planet. Barry King and Andy Collins, who carefully investigated the case, are convinced she is telling the truth. Some of the details tally with similar unrelated accounts from other parts of the world. The close encounter of the intimate kind is said to have occurred at Langford Budville, England on the 16th. The woman was driving to see her sister about 11 p.m. when the car engine and lights cut out. She got out to see what was wrong and felt some- thing touch her. She turned to see a 7-foot tall, robot-like figure. She fainted, and when she came around she and the robot were outside a 40-foot high and 20-foot long vehicle with windows around its dome. She passed out again, and when she came to was in a circular room. She was bound to a metallic table with a blue blanket covering her naked body. The walls gave off an eerie glow and there was little evi- dence of color in the room except for grey dials and buttons. The robot was motionless in the corner while three men, all around five-feet, seven inches tall, with fair skin a/id very round, emotional eyes, all in pale blue tunics, skull caps and face masks, conducted an examination with a tubular device with two-inch-wide cubes, glowing red and green, to scan her body. The men left, but one returned and placed a small pincer-like device to her thigh. She felt freezing cold. Then, without emotion or passion, he sexually assault- ed her. The woman passed out again and when she came to, was sitting in her car. It was 2 a.m. The engine started and when she got home she told her husband. Shortly thereafter the British UFO Research Associa- tion was notified. On the 17th, Mars Walker, 20, observed a doughnut-shaped object descend from the sky at 2 a.m. near Danielsville, Georgia. The object â which was about 17 feet in diameter â was about 50 yards away when it stopped in mid-air. After five minutes of hovering, the siren-like sound com- ing from the object grew louder, \"and a thing took shape within the doughnut- shape, in the hole of the doughnut.\" In another minute the thing was clearly visible,\" a human-like being, standing erect, and it was a sea green â opaque like a hologram,\" Walker said. \"He or it had a number of oddly shaped objects that he wore on a plastic belt.\" He guessed these to be some kind of instrument with \"an egg-shape with one end of the egg cut off.\" These changed in color, and the figure appeared to take readings with them, ignoring Walker. When this was done, the thing was taken back up into the \"vessel\". Walker noted a \"medusa-head\", or tentacle-like objects surrounding the being's head, and hands of three or four fingers, but otherwise \"human\" characteristics. He noted no skin color except the \"sea green\" light which shone from the vessel. The entire scene had the appearance of \"an electrical field\". *** TEN YEARS AGO - October 1978: Deanne Kearns had a close encounter near Ord, Nebraska on the morning of the 9th. She oberved a grey, metallic disc hovering 200 to 300 feet off the ground and, as she watched, a beam of light shown downward from the disc to the ground and two \"things\" floated down to the ground in the beam. They were five to six feet tall, looked around, took some samples of shrubs and soil, and then ascended back into the disc in the beam of light. The tenth grade student described the two \"things\" as being blackish-brown in color, their heads were blob-like, and they had tentacles on their sides. After about ten minutes or so, the disc shot straight up into the sky and was out of sight in a few seconds.

Miller, then a reporter for The Wall Street Journal and now national editor of The Los Angeles Times, was told by then- California Gov. Ronald Reagan about his having sighted an unidentified flying ob- ject on a flight in his private plane. Reagan had persuaded his pilot to follow the object, which was heading toward Bakersfield. But then, he told Miller, \"it went straight up!\" Reagan soon told his wife about what he had seen, and they did some personal research. Reagan related to Miller that they had found references to UFOs in Egyptian hieroglyphics. Reagan was ex- tremely animated as he spoke, and it became clear to Miller that the governor really believed in flying saucers. But when Miller asked him, \"Governor, are you telling me you saw a UFO?\" he said that Reagan seemed to remember sud- denly that he was talking to a reporter. \"This look crossed his face,\" recalled Miller, who said that Reagan then re- plied, \"Let's just say that I'm agnostic.\" This was also the answer Reagan gave in 1988 when questions arose about wheth- er he shared his wife's belief in astrology. 22 MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Comments on Photographic Trickery By Foster Morrison Mr. Morrison is a mathemati- cian and president of Turtle Hol- low Associates, Inc. He has deve- loped theories in approximations, statistics, and non-linear dynam- ics for applications in geodesy, celestial mechanics, and forecast- ing. In addition to being an avid photographer, he spent many years editing the translation journal, Geodesy, Mapping & Photogramme- try. The recent article by Clive Tobin (1988) is far too negative about the value of photographic images (pun intended!). It would be very difficult to create a photographic hoax that would fool an experienced photo- grapher and it would be an extraor- dinary feat to pull the wool over the eyes of a scientist experienced in image analysis. Let's start with Tobin's (1988) observation that \"A statement was recently published to the effect that there are no films made for reproduc- ing negatives as negatives.\" Where was said statement published, in The New York Times, Modem Photography, or some specialized technical journal? More likely than not, the item referred to was my recent article in this very journal. What I really said was, \"There is no conuenfiona/ pro- cess for duplicating color negatives.\" [Emphasis added here.] I thought that this might stimulate a comment on the existence of some kind of special film or service available, as indeed it has. Actually, one could duplicate color negatives using conventional or slide duplicating films. Never having tried this, I have no idea how bad the color shift would be. Tobin's (1988) failure to cite my article or some other source of a recently published statement does not uphold the standards of magazine journalism, let alone scientific publica- MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 tion. But let me leave this question in the laps of the author, the editor and the MUFON officers. The article by Tobin makes a lot of assertions about photography, of which I will address only a few of the major points. Contrary to what most people think, Hollywood's special effects are not all that demanding. The results are flashed on the screen to an uncritical and untrained audience at 24 frames per second. By contrast, still photography often is studied in depth by picture editors and critics. In the extreme case, photographs may be scrutinized and measured by scientists and technicians. These activi- ties differ in intensity of analysis by orders of magnitude. To say that Hol- lywood could fool professional photo- grammetrists has to be a bad joke. Yes, it could happen, but it is not very likely. Steven Spielberg's budgets run into the tens of millions of dollars to produce crude images to entertain the general public. Producing a few really good single frames to fool an experienced photographer might cost a little less; one good fake to deceive the experts in the intelligence com- munity would likely cost as much as a whole season in Hollywood. In the case of UFO research, we don't have the resources of the CIA. So I will look at the case of hoaxing the experienced photographer, who may also have some scientific training and experience. Small scale prints and Polaroid shots are about the lowest quality you can get. Reproduce them in a newspaper or the MUFON Journal and resolution and contrast drop even more. Even so, Tobin's exam- ples are not very convincing. The disk looks like a silhouette and the double exposure is obviously just that. Serious research requires the origi- nal negatives or transparencies and even the camera. Films have the emulsion types recorded on the edges, except for some anonymous house brands like Ritz Camera's Big Print (I was told it's Agfa). If the film is indeed Eastman 5249 (Color Reversal Intermediate), be very suspicious. If the negatives are conventional emulsions, look for color shifts and contrast build-up. The same is true of transparency films. Black and white is more difficult to evaluate, but it will tend to loose shadow and highlight detail on reproduction. Do go to see ... Roger Rabbit. The scenes that include the cartoon overlays are typi- caly muddy and suffer contrast build- up. This is partly disguised by the poor quality of the rest of the movie's photography. The Eastman movie films are grainy and otherwise very poor image mak- ers. They also fade rapidly. Their advantages are high speed, good tol- erance for color temperature varia- tions (corrected by filtration or pro- cessing), adaptability for push-process- ing, economy, and ease of use. A number of West coast photo labs spool the 5247, 5295, or Fuji equival- ents for 35 mm cameras. Try some yourself, dear reader! But I remember real Technicolor (color separation) movies and load Kodachrome into my Pentaxes. Experience and a practiced eye will eliminate at least 90 percent of the photographs that should be discarded. Endless hours have been wasted by UFO investigators, including profes- sional scientists, on photographs that any photographer would chuck in the waste basket immediately. Most scien- tists have little or no experience in photography or anything outside their narrow specialty. By contrast, the serious UFO investigator should buy a decent 35 mm camera, a fast tele- photo lens, and try all kinds of films. The most remarkable thing about the \"Billy\" Meier pictures is how good they are. The color shifts and con- 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"trast build-up are minimal for sup- posed second or third generation negatives printed on a four-color press. All we can say is that Mr. Meier had a lot of skilled help staging those pictures, whether the UFOs were real or papier-mache. The most recent detailed photo- graphs are from the Gulf Breeze, FL case. All I have seen are copies of the Polaroids. Even on the cover of the August, 1988 MUFON Journal you can see the high contrast and the typ- ical splotchy, uneven development. Yet this is one of the best docu- mented photos we have. The UFOs, frankly, look ludicrous. The lights on the bottom are totally superfluous. They belong on Coney Island. Meier's UFOs, by sharp contrast, remind one of the no-nonsense construction of a fighter-bomber, albeit with radically different technology. This absurdity factor, as noted by Vallee (1988), has been a means of eluding the interest of the Scientific Establishment and causing it no con- cern for its position; yet this also appeals to the masses because it is so non-threatening. This is very sophis- ticated psychological warfare. In this case, only the investigation [Ware & Andrus, 1988] gives any credibility to the photos. The few good photos of UFOs are those that have been obtained by chance. Mr. Ed's photo opportunities obviously have been staged for the reasons I discussed earlier [Morrison, 1988]. The Meier case has been so clouded by disin- formation and character assassination that it's beyond redemption with any feasible amount of effort, at least for now. One reason there are so few decent UFO photographs is that no one is making any concerted effort to produce any. If National Geographic depended on reader submissions, the quality and character of its photo- graphy would be markedly different from what it is now. Putting a profes- sional photographer or a single scien- tific investigator in the field costs at least $100,000.00 per year. Ufology remains a hobby for all, except per- haps person or persons unknown in the Federal Spook Works. A ten-power glass and an expe- rienced eye will allow an investigator 24 Ufology remains a hobby for all, except perhaps person or persons unknown in the Federal Spook Works. to screen out the flying hubcaps and even most trickery up to the Holly- wood level. Anything left can be sub- jected to digitization and numerical image analysis. Unfortunately, this is costly and if you don't get a report signed by a recognized investigator, it is worse than worthless. The best practice is never to cite sources who re- fuse to be named. If someone has analyzed data and come to conclu- sions and refuses to acknowledge this, I wouldn't take that person or his conclusions seriously. The same technology that makes it possible to detect photographic hoax- es also facilitates making them. Exam- ples abound. In a recent copy of Pho- tomethods, William G. Hyzer (1987) discusses and illustrates some of the possibilities. If you look at his sample (p. 25), the digitally-retouched model looks glassy-eyed and plastic. You don't have to be an expert to discern this. However, if you didn't have the original for comparison, detecting and retouching would be far more diffi- cult. This is where experience helps. But expensive equipment is not always essential. Digital retouching and enhancement often produce tell-tale signs in the form of excessive detail or textures. This occurs due to sidelobe leakage in Fourier transform computations and the non-stationary character of original images. A similar analog effect can be seen in photographs screened for printing twice, often necessary if the original is lost: the Moire pattern. To see one, place one piece of window screen on top of another, rotate them and translate them, and watch the strange patterns appear and disappear. Or look on page 10 of the December, 1986 MUFON Journal. Some of these effects can be ame- liorated by processing the image in sections. So one is really reduced to the art of retouching as once prac- ticed with a brush, despite all the computers and high-powered mathe- matics. And often the \"brushmarks\" can be spotted as well by eye as by automated image analysis. Whole scenes can be fabricated using fractal algorithms, and Hollywood is doing more and more of this as the costs of on-sight shoots climb out of sight and revenues dwindle. A well- illustrated review of the state-of-the- art was done by George D. Levy (1988) for PC Computing. Movies that are completely computer-generat- ed, with no photography or cartoo- nists involved, are possible, but not very convincing. (Was Disney's Tron the first one?) Mr. Tobin is, of course, very cor- rect in his general conclusion that a photograph alone is of very limited use as either scientific or legal evi- dence. Scientific proof demands a testable hypothesis, which is a con- trolled experiment whose outcome depends on whether the assumption is true or false. Very little in \"science\" ever satisfies that stringent criterion. Most of it is useless make-work pro- jects intended to disguise college teachers and bureaucrats as \"scho- lars.\" It is a fairly harmless form of pork-barrel. Unless an accident happens, the only proof we shall have for the real- ity of UFOs is statistical. Phil Klass is deliberately sending us off on a wild goose chase to find the case that is 99.9 percent sure of being genuine. We have several thousand that are at least one percent sure. If you have two such cases, then the chance of at least one being true rises to 1.99 percent. As you add more cases you eventually reach 99.9 percent cer- tainty of at least one good case and keep slowly adding 9's thereafter. This is not a proof of UFO existence, but a sufficient rational argument for serious investigation. This, of course, will never happen. The issue is not one of reason, but of fear on the part of the Political and Scientific Establishments. They fear the loss of their power and authority, and the more it fades, the more terri- fied they become.

Kendall County Sighting By Eugene Zavodny Zavodny is a MUFON consul- tant in mechanical engineering. Four young brothers were playing ball in their backyard when one of them noticed an object hovering over a nearby empty chicken house. All four watched in amazement as the object slowly drifted the length of the chicken house and out over a plowed field. Sound like a balloon? The boys certainly don't think it was. MUTUAL UFO Journal, Number 246, October 1988 The sighting occurred at approxi- mately 6:50 p.m. CDT, April 10, 1988 in rural Kendall County, IL. The area is gently rolling, relatively open farm land with occasional farm houses and farm buildings. The boys' house is on the east side of the north-south Hel- mar Road; a pair of high-tension power lines runs parallel to the road and about 250 yards west of it. The object was first sighted by the oldest brother, Mike Chapman, age 17. He was approximately 50 feet west of it at the time. He shouted to the other boys, Jeff, age 14, Phil, age 12, and Danny, age 10. When they first observed the object it was sta- tionary and some five to 10 feet above the roof of the chicken house. After a few seconds it began moving south at two or three miles per hour, approximately following the ridge of the chicken house roof. As it did so it also began to rotate about an imagi- nary east-west axis. Its motion resemb- led that of a large wheel rolling through the sky. Mike walked up to the chicken house and then along with the object past the end of the chicken house and for a short distance out into the field. His closest approach to it was about 25 feet. It consisted of a metallic-looking, silver-colored box about the size of a small car with a bent pipe protruding from the bot- tom. The component that resembled a saucer cut in half was attached to the end of the pipe. A smaller saucer- shaped component was attached to one side of the box. All of the surfa- ces appeared to be smooth, with no bolts, rivets, or other protrusions evi- dent. The pipe had a longitudinal black stripe on it. The object made no noise. Two dogs, apparently asleep in the nearby barn, did not notice it. The object continued to move south across the adjacent field until it paused momentarily over an equip- ment shed near another farmhouse, about 200 yards away. From there it moved off to the southwest, across the road and over the power lines. It then disappeared rapidly, appearing to shrink in size as it did so. About the time the object was over the shed to the south Danny ran into the house to get the boys' parents. By the time they realized what was going on and got outside, the object had disappeared. The TV was on at the time of the sighting and no effect on it was noticed. No one was at home at the other house. The entire family got in their car and drove south down Helmar Road in search of the object but did not sight it. After they returned to the house, Linda Chapman, (the boys' 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"mother), along with Mike, Phil, and Danny, drove out again. When they were about two miles to the south they suddenly noticed a pair of lights that resembled the landing lights of an aircraft. The lights were about 45Â° up from the horizon. Although the sky was still light enough that an air- craft should have been visible, no object could be seen behind the lights. When the car accelerated toward them, the left light of the two sud- denly disappeared. A few seconds later the other light also disappeared. No object could be seen. As the sky was overcast, the lights could have merely gone into the clouds. After they were all back in the house the father of the boys, Dale Chapman, had each boy sit down and draw a sketch of the object that they had seen over the chicken house without discussing it with the other boys. Three of the sketches were remarkably similar. The fourth, .Jeff's was somewhat different. How- ever; Jeff was the most distant from the object and viewed it from a different direction than the others. He was more behind the object relative to its direction of motion. His sketch of it from this angle is not contradictory to the other sketches. The boys gave every indication that they believed that they saw what they reported. They were sufficiently frighten- ed by the sighting that they slept together in the living room that night rather than upstairs in their bed- rooms. They also piled cushions against the windows. This investigator has no reason to doubt their sincerity. At this time the object remains unidentified.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant OCTOBER 1988 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Although Earth separates from its neighbor Mars this month (the ruddy planet fades a whole magnitude during October), the little world still commands our attention. In Pisces, it is low in the ESE at dusk in mid- October (then at -2.4 magnitude) and remains visible in the southern sky most of the night. Mars lies below the gibbous Moon on the 22nd and resumes eastward motion on the 30th. Jupiter, brightening and once again surpassing Mars in brightness after early October, is found between the Hyades and Pleiades clusters in Tau- rus. Gleaming at -2.8 in midmonth, the giant rises in the NE about 8 PM and follows Mars across the southern sky during the night. Jupiter rises an hour earlier by month's end as it heads toward opposition in November. Saturn, in Sagittarius, lies in the SSW at dusk, setting in the WSW about 9:30 PM in mid-October. The ringed planet passes 1.1Â° north of the planet Uranus on the 17th â the third and last conjunction this year between the pair. Use binoculars or a telescope to view Uranus, which is more than 100 times fainter than Saturn. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus, at -4.1 magnitude, rises in the east about 3:30 AM in midmonth and is high in the ESE at dawn. On October 4 watch our brilliant neighbor passing only about %Â° south of the star Regulus. Even though Regulus is a first-magnitude star, it is 160 times dimmer than the planet. Binoculars will help. Just two mornings later the crescent Moon lies just above the star and planet â a beautiful sight! And on the 7th the lunar crescent is below the pair. Look for the tiny orange planet Mercury about 20Â° below Venus the last week of October. Mars sets in the west before twilight begins in midmonth. Jupiter stands high in the SW at dawn. The gibbous Moon is near the planet on the 27th. Meteor Shower: The Moon will be out of the way after about 2:30 AM on October 21, the peak date of the Orionid meteors. The rate builds that morning to about 25 meteors per hour toward dawn. The shower radiates from Orion's club in the south; the meteors are swift and mostly faint, although some bright fireballs can be expected.

Observers can find the Great Square of Pegasus well up in the SE at 9 PM. Pegasus, of course, is the famous winged horse of mythology; the group of stars does look some- thing like a horse flying upside-down if you know which stars outline the head, neck, and front legs. What looks like the hind legs of the horse is really another constellation, the Princes Andromeda. In fact, the NE corner of the Great Square marks the head of the woman, and two strings of stars extending outward form her body. Just NW of Andromeda lies her mother, the W-shaped Cassiopeia the Queen. And west of the queen we find the faint and obscure Cepheus the King, shaped like a house with a peaked roof.

Marge has been disturbed by the unscientific statements made by investigators pro and con on the Gulf Breeze Case. Official position statements published in the September 1988 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal by CUFOS and MUFON indicate essential agree- ment that Gulf Breeze is potentially a significant UFO case that deserves further scientific study and investiga- tion before an ultimate decision may be rendered. Very favorable exposure was given to the Gulf Breeze Case on October 5, 1988 when NBC-TV aired the one- hour program \"Unsolved Mysteries\" narrated by Robert Stack. This was the first opportunity for the populace in the U.S.A. and Canada to have direct contact with this important case. Cosgrove/Meurer Productions Continued on page 27"}]
