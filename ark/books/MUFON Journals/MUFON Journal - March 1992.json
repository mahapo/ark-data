Since that time, much new data has come to light. The response to the initial article has been gratifying; about three dozen additional cases have surfaced to date, and gradually a 200-case catalogue will be assembled. The pros and cons of this controversial sub- ject are being debated, and researchers and witnesses alike are giving valuable input. Some say it is impossible to fend off contact; they reason that UFO entities are technological- ly superior to us. Others contend that some witnesses are merely permitted by the entities to believe that they have broken contact. Other witnesses tentatively accept the possibility of successful resistance and ask for advice on how to accomplish this. Others, who share a feeling that \"UFO entities\" are helping the human race evolve spiritually, have no interest in fending off contact. In more than twenty years of abduction research, I have always worked on the principle that each witness knows better than anyone what he or she has seen and experienced, and that witnesses are the best judges concerning the motives of entities who contact them. I am open to the possibility that the UFO Phenomenon might be composed of several groups of unknown intelligences, whose motives can range all the way from positive to negative and whose effects on witnesses range all the way from terror to euphoria. Resistance techniques are recommended only for those witnesses who experience trauma as a result of UFO encounters, and who feel a sense of viola- tion from ongoing contact. Not all UFO contact causes trauma. Numerous cases in which landed UFOs are unexpectedly encountered out-of- doors by witnesses seem to be of a more benign nature. In such cases, the occupants seem eager to depart the scene when discovered (2). Other cases, occuring both outdoors and in- doors, suggest close contact by benign beings (3). As a rule, however, benign entities are described as appearing quite dif- ferent from the typical short, large-headed \"grays.\" It seems undeniable, however, that various forms of trauma are sustained by close encounter witnesses during typical \"ab- duction scenarios.\" The human race has a basic right to preserve itself from unwanted interference, especially from unidentifiable beings. As regards the common notion in the field that UFO entities are helping the human race evolve, nothing is stated in the great works of philosophy or religion about other orders of creation being responsible for us. The sole exception to this is, possibly, a class of beings referred THERE IS MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT UFO ABDUCTIONS TAKE PLACE WHEN THE WITNESS IS ALREADY IN AN ALTERED STATE OF MIND to as \"angels,\" which according to great works such as the Koran and the Old and New Testaments, are messengers from God, who specifically deliver warnings of personal or group danger. The popular concept that human beings have \"guar- dian\" angels who help guide and direct us throughout our life is also commonly held. Although books on angels are currently popular, very little is known definitely about the essential nature of these spiritual beings (4). The evolutionary process of humankind — that is, our transformation into more spiritual beings (5) — is not prov- en to be in the hands of any known order of creation, except ourselves. Some literature in the field takes the position that \"extraterrestrials\" have been influencing our evolution for thousands of years, but as yet there is no firm proof of this. A controversial idea in the UFO field postulates that UFO abductions are for the purpose of genetic experiments, inter- breeding and are thus part of an evolutionary process. If this were so, I think that two things would be evident: 1) The process would be mentioned in the literature of our major philosophies and religions; and 2) The process would take place without major trauma. Although many witnesses are able to withstand abduction and emerge as stronger human be- ings, many more are damaged for life. Those in the field who favor the extrater- restrial hypothesis assume that outer space be- ings who travel in spacecraft must necessarily be technologically and intellectually superior to us, and that ETs use superior technology to render witnesses compliant during their experiments. Although the fact of compliance — generally through paralysis — is undeniably a part of the \"abduction\" process, there is no convincing evidence that superior technology causes it. The entities may just as well have ways of mentally affect- ing witness. There is mounting evidence that indoor UFO abductions, at least, take place when the witness is already in an altered state, such as some phase of sleep, drowsily watching television, etc. The creatures may know how to deepen altered states, which often involve temporary paralysis of large muscle groups (6). This does not constitute proof of mental superiority, merely that they are aware of certain facts of human physiology. Even though the human race is still somewhat savage, Ann Druffel is the Journal's Contributing Editor and a well-known writer in the field. Her most recent appearance in these pages was \"Missing Fetus Case Solved\" in the November 1991 issue. She lives in Pasadena, California. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Isn't it logical to hypothesize that our modern \"UFO abducting entity\" is simply an old human problem, dressed in space suits to fit our present cultural expectations? there are large portions of the earth where great civilizations recognize that each human individual has inalienable rights. Yet, most abducting entities treat human beings as having no rights. The contention that these entities necessarily regard us as \"lab animals\" because they are so far above us on the evolutionary scale does not hold water. If the entities are as advanced as some believe, they should recognize our race as a struggling, but essentially spiritual, form of life. My working hypothesis at the present time is that \"abduct- ing entities\" are not extraterrestrial. If they were, they would be undoubtedly superior to us — at least technologically — and resistance techniques simply would not work against them. Yet more and more evidence is surfacing that these bedroom intruders can be driven off. It is more logical to hypothesize that these unidentified intelligences are from an intradimen- sional source or sources, and are very possibly perceived by witnesses in altered states of consciousness. \"Intradimen- sional\" creatures such as the Celtic \"faery folk\" (7), the Muslim jinns (8), the incubi of medieval times (9), the \"Old Hag\" (10) of Newfoundland, and other unworldly creatures have reportedly been harassing, kidnapping, and imposing sexual encounters upon members of the human race for thousands of years. Isn't it logical to hypothesize that our modern \"UFO abducting entity\" is simply an old human prob- lem, dressed in space suits to fit our present cultural expectations? The intradimensional hypothesis does not take away from the fact that such encounters are \"real\" to the percipient. There is ample data to indicate that these entities are temporarily physical during at least some phase of the encounters and able to produce real physical effects. It is important to the hypothesis of \"resistance techniques\" to present evidence that abducting entities, at least, are not extraterrestrial. \"UFO entities\" associated with abduction scenarios seem to be intradimensional in nature because they are reported to materialize and dematerialize and to move through solid, physical matter (11). They also, in some cases, seem to be able to shape-shift according to the demands of the moment. The transitory nature of entities seems to in- dicate that they are only temporarily visible in our space-time. If this is so, we can postulate that when their purpose is com- pleted, the energy from which their temporarily physical bodies are formed returns to the source from which it originated, leaving us no real clue as to their true nature or appearance. If the entities are only temporarily physical, then the craft to which they transfer the abducted witnesses are logically also temporarily physical. This could be the reason why no abducting craft or entities are described in exactly the same way. Of course, abductees who have ongoing encounters often see the same craft and entities repeatedly, but this is quite another matter. Applying the above to our main purpose here, we reiterate that if these entities are not technologically superior to us and are not a permanent part of our space-time, human be- ings should be able to break off contact with them if they choose. The human mind is a powerful instrument — a bridge be- tween a superbly evolved physical body and the human spirit of life esssnce, sometimes called the elan vital or, more simp- ly, the soul. The mind is capable of curing physical and mental disease, it is even capable of affecting matter, as demonstrated by psychokinetic experiments in parapsychological labs worldwide. Why should we not believe that it can fend off invasion by other-dimensional creatures? R esearch over the past two years has demonstrated that the techniques which witnesses use successfully are, for the most part, ordinary abilities of the human mind. In my prior article in this Journal, Jan Whitley's technique of righteous anger was described (12). Jan was a person of great will power. She had survived an unhappy childhood, moved away from home, found loving foster parents, and worked part-time until she finished school. When the repeated attacks began, at the age of 23, she was living alone. She in- stinctively used mental struggle against them, successfully each time as far as she was aware. The attacks continued, however, and Jan got fed up with the invasion of her privacy. She began to mentally scream at them, \"Go away and leave me alone.\" This technique of righteous anger worked faster for Jan than mental struggle. The technique of mental struggle was also used by Emily Cronin (13). For several months in 1956 and 1957, she was visited repeatedly in the middle of the night by white-skinned entities with large eyes and oversize heads. She found that, by combined physical and mental struggle, she could manage to move one finger or toe, upon which the paralysis and the presences would vanish. Emily Cronin, like Jan Whitley, is strongly aware of her rights as a Person, with an inner con- viction that her individual dignity is inviolable. Another witness, Robert Nolan (14) served in the military in Vietnam. He learned to sense the presence of the Viet- cong before any of his five normal senses could logically in- dicate that they were in the vicinity; this intuition saved his life several times. Upon returning to the U.S., Robert began to have encounters at night with typical UFO-type entities, reportedly experiencing abductions, examinations, etc. Robert learned to sense when an encounter was about to happen. He finds it rather difficult to verbalize adequately just what he senses, but likens it to the same type of intuition which had served him on the battlefield. The creatures still occasional- ly try to contact him, but he has found that resistance — in his case, mental struggle — in the very early stages of ap- proach works much faster than if he waits until the entities materialize. Robert's experiences seem to add strength to the intradimen- sional hypothesis. It is logical to assume that, if the visitors MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"are physical in the sense that we ourselves are physical, that the environment in which an encounter occurs would not be disturbed overly by their presence. However, if we theorize that the entities are entering our space-time from another dimension, it seems more logical that our space-time environ- ment would be disturbed — disturbances that might be de- tectable intuitively. The technique of appealing to spiritual personages, which was also described in my initial article, seems to be com- monly used; it has been reported to me by several witnesses as being effective; the spiritual personage differs with each witness' personal beliefs. Whether or not a person believes in spiritual personages, a basic fact remains: If witnesses in- volved in UFO encounters feel within themselves that they have inviolable rights, they are protected by that knowledge, and likewise, if witnesses feel that they can be protected by a spiritual source outside themselves, they are protected by that knowledge. Another case, where the witnesses used a variety of techni- ques, is that of Morgana Van Klausen, whose possible backyard UFO landing trace and entity encounters have been described in IUR (15) and this Journal (16). This author and MUFON investigator Georgeanne Cifarelli have researched this case together. Beginning in December of 1987 through May 1991, Morgana experienced monthly, disturbing occur- rences. During some of these experiences, large-eyed creatures materialized in her home, generally at night; other experiences involved unexplained time lapses, one of which was associated with the sighting of a large light moving about her yard. Her five-year-old son also reported seeing creatures in his room, and he sketched the exterior and interior of \"space craft\" which he reportedly had seen. Frightened, Morgana left lights on at night in the hall and bath, and this seemed to prevent the experiences from recur- ring. Her husband, a well-known professional man, thought her experiences were imaginary and argued with her about leaving the lights on. Then, her husband viewed the entities one night while in a paralyzed state; he immediately became more supportive and no longer argued about keeping lights on at night! M organa was strengthened by his support. When alone in the house, she began to verbalize a strong rejection toward the entities, telling them to \"Go away and don't come back!\" Through a combination of techni- ques — her verbal rejections, leaving lights on at night, and hanging a rosary on her lamp stand — she eventually felt pro- tected and was able to resume a normal life free from terror for several months. In March 1990, Morgana experienced a traumatic miscar- riage which she associated, at first, with a possible \"miss- ing fetus\" situation (17). In June of the same year, she began to have pain throughout her entire body. Her personal physi- cian suspected it was lupus, but tests could not confirm this. The pain intensified into burning sensations; numerous tests, including CAT scans, could not identify the cause. A Witnesses who feel that their rights are be- ing violated seem to be more likely to try, and succeed with, resistance techniques. neurologist finally diagnosed it as fibromyecitis and told Morgana that this condition results from severe trauma to the body, such as car accidents and rape. Neither of these had happened to Morgana, and she was forced to \"wait it out\" for seven months, drinking large quantities of water at her doctor's orders, in order to wash the toxins out of her muscles and nerve endings. The doctor told Morgana that the severi- ty and length of her disorder were exceptional. Her last, apparently isolated, entity encounter occurred in May 1991 when one of the white-skinned creatures material- ized by her bedside. Morgana was able to break through paralysis and lunge at it in an effort to protect herself. When she pushed the creature, it disappeared. A similar technique of a supportive family link, sharing in the entity encounters and providing help and advice which had been of invaluable help to Morgana Van Klausen was also used by a correspondent of mine from Florida, whom I shall call Jean. She had numerous experiences with a frightening figure which harassed her as a child. The entity, in her words, was \"almost like an electronic force, trying to pull me out of my body.\" She confided in her grandmother, and learned that the older woman had had the same problem and had defended herself with prayer. The grandmother even had a name for the creature — \"medvet,\" or \"creature that comes in the night\" (18). At her grandmother's suggestion, Jean armed herself with pictures of the Sacred Heart, a Catholic concept of Christ. D uring subsequent encounters, the witness informed the creature that the Sacred Heart was protecting her against it. She controlled her terror and asked the entity questions, such as \"Who are you?\" and \"What do you want?\" She never received an answer; instead, the creature would come closer, right up to her face, and at this point the witness would leap out of bed and run out of the room. The protection Jean felt she had from spiritual forces did not stop the thing from coming, but she had confidence that her align- ment with a protecting power kept her from harm. Besides common mental and physical techniques such as mental and physical struggle, righteous anger, empathetic sup- port from family adults, and appeals to spiritual personages, there are various metaphysical techniques which are also reportedly effective and are capable of being learned. A com- mon one seems to be the process of \"wrapping oneself with white light.\" There are various ways of performing this mental act, all of which seem equally effective. Some persons envision the light as coming in through the top of the head (also called the crown chakra), spreading throughout the body, and ex- tending out a few inches. It is commonly used during medita- tion and during hypnosis by metaphysically-inclined clinicians. It basically is a means of protecting the human being from MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"intrusion by unwholesome forces, which are believed by many to gain easy entry into a person's psyche while in altered states. If one considers intrusive and abducting \"UFO entities\" as unwholesome forces, and believes in the efficacy of the \"white light\" technique, it can be an effective means of resisting con- tact, as demonstrated by several cases I have collected. Other metaphysical techniques, such as the \"internal sound\" used by Lori Briggs (19), are available, and will be discussed in future articles. Many witnesses' descriptions in the literature emphasize that the eyes of abducting entities are \"almost hypnotic\" and have the ability to bring on paralysis and compliance. The case of Licia Davidson is a case in point. Together with her roommate (20), she has reportedly experienced multiple ab- ductions during the past five and one-half years; their case has been closely followed by John Miller, M.D. of San Pedro. Licia has conscious recall of many of the experiences; she has also been regressed by a hypnotherapist in the Southern California area. During one hypnotic session with her therapist, Licia went into a very deep trance, and recognized with some surprise that is seemed to be the same type of altered state she remembered from her abduction experiences. Her therapist gave her post-hypnotic suggestions that she would be able to \"expand her subconscious\" whenever she felt she was hav- ing an encounter, permitting her to remember and control events in the encounter itself. Since her anger level was ris- ing because of the frequent intrusions, Licia was also en- couraged by Dr. Miller to try warding off any contact she felt was intrusive. She agreed to try and practiced her techni- que of \"expanding the subconscious\" daily in 15-minute meditative periods, using a brain synchronization machine, which supposedly uses light and sound to synchronize the hemispheres of the brain. The theory behind this is that brain chemical activity is stimulated by these two channels (21). A t a subsequent abduction experience, smaller gray be- ings whom she refers to as \"workers\" fit her with a hearing device and told her she would hear \"the voice of God.\" The voice she heard through the device was flat, unfeeling and mechanical. Licia concluded that the small gray beings were lying to her and refused to listen further through the device. She turned her back to them and avoided eye con- tact. She felt \"an explosion of temper\" from the beings and sensed confusion and chaos among them. Presently a five-foot gray being came in and established order among them, and led Licia into another room. Glanc- ing at the smaller beings, she saw them standing motionless in rows, \"parked like statues.\" She felt that she might be killed because of her resistance, and so decided to be compliant. However, in spite of her resistance, that particular encounter ended on a benign note. Licia could not tell whether this feeling that she \"was go- ing to be killed\" came from her own subconscious or from some mental suggestion by the entities. Her case is very com- plex, but what is important here is that a deliberate resistance technique by a witness apparently interferred with a maneuver on the part of the entities which the witness considered deceptive. The contacts are ongoing, causing the witness much frustra- tion and concern, but Davidson states she does not want to break off contact altogether. She is profoundly curious about the entities and wants to see if she can communicate mean- ingfully and honestly with them, in order to find out what they really are and why they are contacting her. She feels that judicious use of resistance techniques might help bring this about. This leads us to the subject of another technique which, although related to righteous anger as used by Jan Whitley, nevertheless has essential differences. Protective rage has been used successfully by several witnesses and brings about rather rapid departure of intrusive entities (22). It is the strong ver- balization of rejection, directed toward the entities, often stem- ming from the witnesses' desire to protect others besides themselves. Essentially, righteous anger is a somewhat milder emotion; it can be demonstrated without words, is often used during an encounter itself and the motive is often pro- tection of oneself. Protective rage, on the other hand, uses verbalization in strong, rejecting language, intends protec- tion for other members of the household, and can be used not only during encounters, but after them. When used in the latter fashion, it possibly establishes a protective shield, so to speak, around the witnesses, their family and home. Morgana Van Klausen used it effectively in association with other techniques, as described above. For resistance techniques to work, witnesses (and the re- searchers who work with them) must concede the possibility that they can work. Witnesses and researchers who are con- vinced that the entities' motive are associated with our spiritual evolution, tend to downplay the possibility of resistance techni- ques and are not inclined to try them, even though trauma results from ongoing encounters. Witnesses who feel that their rights are being violated seem to be more likely to try, and succeed with, resistance techni- ques. The controversy thus far has brought up a basic ques- tion: \"Since these entities appear superior to us, aren't we obliged to do what they say?\" In my opinion, if unknown types of entities want something from us, let them explain what they need, ask us for our cooperation, and somehow provide verification to our satisfaction that they are telling the truth (23). This, in itself, could be a very long process'. In summary, even though \"UFO entities\" easily paralyze and render most of their victims pliable and cooperative, this does not necessarily indicate technological and/or mental superiority. The entities probably know that the humans they approach without warning will be terrorized. Human beings fear the unknown; fear is part of our normal survival pro- cess. It is possible that the paralysis which is part of most abduction scenarios is at least partially self-produced; we are all familiar with the concept of \"self-paralyzing fear.\" Con- versely, perhaps the state of altered consciousness in which the majority of these experiences occur brings about tem- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"porary paralysis in large muscle groups; similar types of paralysis occur in other altered states, such as some phases of hypnosis and dreaming. This is not to say that \"UFO ab- ductions\" occur in ordinary dreaming. It is evident that these events have a reality of their own. Much more study needs to be done. A 200-case catalogue which I am assembling will allow statistical and psychological studies to be made. Personality profiles of witnesses who suc- cessfully fend off unwanted contact can be compared with personality traits of witnesses who report being unable, or unwilling, to try. Researchers, investigators and witnesses who know of such cases are invited to share reports of this type. The controversial nature of this subject is fully recognized, and both positive and negative input is welcome.

Mack, M.Q T he idea that men, women and children can be taken against their wills from their homes, cars and schoolyards by strange humanoid beings, lifted onto spacecraft and subjected to intrusive and threatening pro- cedures is so terrifying, and yet so shattering to our notions of what is possible in our universe, that the actuality of the phenomenon has been largely rejected out of hand or bizarrely distorted in most media accounts. This is altogether under- standable, given the disturbing nature of UFO abductions and our prevailing notions of reality. The fact remains, however, that for 30 years, and possibly longer, thousands of individuals who appear to be sincere, of sound mind and are seeking no personal benefit from their stories, have been providing to those who will listen to them consistent reports of precisely such events. Population surveys suggest that hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million persons in the United States alone may be abductees or \"experiencers\" as they are sometimes called. The abduction phenomenon is, therefore, of great clinical importance if for no other reason than the fact that abductees are often deeply traumatized by their experiences and need appropriate help. At the same time the subject is of obvious scientific interest, however much it may challenge our notions of reality and truth. The relevant professional communities in mental health, medicine, biology, physics, electronics and other disciplines are understandably skeptical of a phenomenon as strange as UFO abduction which defies our accepted notions of reality. The effort to enable these communities to take abduction reports seriously will be best served through scrupulously conducted research by investigators who.bring a scholarly and dispassionate yet appropriately caring attitude toward their work. In this way patterns and meanings may be discovered which can lead to fuller and deeper knowledge and, even- tually, to the development of convincing theoretical understanding. In this book Temple University historian David Jacobs has provided us with work of just this kind. In a field that lends itself to sensationalistic treatment, we have already come to expect of Jacobs a special standard of rigorous scholarship and careful observation. His 1975 book, The UFO Controversy in America, remains a classic history of the early years of UFO-related events. In the present work Jacobs presents his findings from the investigation of 57 abductees over a six year period, using interviews and hypnosis to overcome their amnesia. His study uncovered approximately 300 abduction experiences. Jacobs' findings will, I believe, impress those who are open at least to the possibility that something important is hap- pening in the lives of these individuals and countless others that cannot readily be explained by the theories and categories currently available to modern science. In Jacobs' cases, as in the work of other investigators, hypnosis has proven to be an essential tool in overcoming the amnesia of his subjects. Lest this lead skeptical readers to question the validity of Jacobs' findings, it must be pointed out that we have no evidence from this or any other study that abductees have invented or distorted significantly under hypnosis their memories of the abduction experience. On the contrary, memories brought forth in hypnotic regressions have been repeatedly shown to be consistent with what these and other abductees are able to recall consciously. Hypnosis appears to complete or add greatly to the process of remembering and has proved in this field to be a valuable therapeutic and in- vestigative tool. Jacobs' work covers a broad range of phenomena associated with UFO encounters. His focus, however, is upon the struc- ture of the abduction experience itself. In case after case he demonstrates a pattern that is consistent, even in minute details, among individuals who have had no opportunity to communicate their experiences to one another, specific elements that are not available in the mass media. This pattern consists of what Jacobs calls \"primary\" ex- periences — physical examination, staring and urological and gynecological procedures; \"secondary\" experiences — machine examination, visualization and child presentation; and \"ancillary\" experiences consisting of various other physical phenomena, mental displays and sexually-related ac- tivities. At the heart of the abduction process there appears to be some sort of complex reproductive enterprise involv- ing the conception, gestation or incubation of human or alien- human hybrid babies. In Jacobs' words, \"the focus of the ab- duction is the production of children.\" Another investigator might place greater emphasis upon phenomena that Jacobs regards as less central, such as the visualizations of planetary destruction and their impact upon the consciousness of abductees. But whatever the emphasis or interpretation of these data we might provide, Jacobs' work has given us a solid foundation of carefully documented ex- perience upon which investigators can now build as we add to our knowledge and explore further the meaning of this puzzling and disturbing matter. Through his meticulous documentation of the structure and content of the UFO abduction phenomenon 'Jacobs has deepened the mystery that lies before us while at the same time bringing us close to some form of understanding. He John E. Mack, M.D., is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Cambridge Hospital, and a MUFON consultant in psychiatry.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"has made clear that we are dealing with a phenomenon that has a hard edge, a huge, strange inter-species or inter-being breeding program that has invaded our physical reality and is affecting the lives of hundreds of thousands if not millions of people and perhaps in some way the consciousness of the entire planet. Jacobs has given us no explanation, but he has set forth explicitly the phenomena for which any theory must account. A mong ufologists and abduction researchers expla- nations have generally fallen into psychosocial (or cultural) and extraterrestrial categories. Psychosocial hypotheses, at least in the Western materialist sense, are dif- ficult to take seriously. For unless we are willing to extend our notions of the powers of the psyche to include the crea- tion of cuts, scars; hemorrhages and bruises, the simultaneous production of highly elaborate and traumatic experiences similar to one another in minute detail among individuals who have not communicated with one another, and all of the physical phenomena associated with the UFOs themselves, such explanations appear quite inadequate. At the same time a literalist extraterrestrial hypothesis must account for the relative paucity of solid physical information — the lack of photographs of the beings, for example — and the virtually insurmountable problems related to accounting for the location, origins and lives of the aliens themselves within the framework of the physical laws of our space/time universe. This last frustration has led some ufologists to posit a \"multiverse\" and the intrusion into our tamiliar reality of other dimensions or forces outside of the known physical universe. Others have turned to alternative notions of the nature of the cosmos, more familiar to eastern religions and philosophy, that depict the universe and all its realities as a vast play of consciousness with physical manifestations. My own work with abductees has impressed me with the powerful dimension of personal growth that accompanies the traumatic experiences that David Jacobs so accurately describes, especially when they receive appropriate help in exploring their abduction histories. An intense concern for the planet's survival and a powerful ecological consciousness seems to develop for many abductees. Whether this is a specific element, or even purpose, of the abduction enter- prise or an inadvertant byproduct of integrating a self- destroying traumatic narrative remains to be explored. Abduction research for me and other investigators has had a shattering impact on our views of the nature of the cosmos. This has led me to offer at least a parable, if not a theory, to illuminate what is going on. Virtually all peoples throughout history, with the exception of the Western culture of the Newto- nian/Cartesian era, have experienced the universe as possess- ing some sort of intelligence or consciousness in which human beings participate with other animate beings and inanimate things in an enterprise that has meaning, purpose and direc- tion, however unfathomable these may be. We in the West seem, for reasons perhaps as mysterious as the abduction phenomenon itself, to have cut ourselves off almost totally from awareness of any form of higher in- telligence. But let us suppose that such an intelligence did exist, and, what is more, it was not indifferent to the fate of the earth, regarding its life forms and transcendent beauty as one of its better or more advanced creations. And let us imagine that the imbalance created by the overgrowth of cer- tain human faculties, a kind of techno-destructive and fear- driven acquisitiveness, were \"diagnosed\" (perceived? fath- omed? felt? — we really do not know how the divinity might experience itself and its creation) as the basic problem. What could be done as a corrective? The two natural approaches of which we can conceive would be the genetic and the environmental. Is it possible that through a vast hybridization program affecting countless numbers of people, while simultaneously invading our con- sciousness with transforming images of the destruction we are doing to ourselves, an effort is being made to place the planet under a kind of receivership? This would not necessarily be for \"our\" good — for this planet, on which humankind has broken the harmony of be- ing, does not exist just for our pleasure — but in order to arrest the destruction of life and to make possible the further evolution of consciousness or whatever the anima mundi has in store. I do not say that this is true, or offer it as a theory. I would merely suggest that if we could allow ourselves to reintroduce the possibility of a higher form of intelligence into the universe, and experience the numinous mystery of creation, this story is consistent with the facts of the abduc- tion phenomenon. David Jacobs has written in his book, \"No significant body of thought has come about that presents strong evidence that anything else is happening other than what the abductees have stated.\" He has made his case well and has greatly enriched our knowledge of what the abductees have to tell of their ex- periences. We must now go on from here.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ABDUCTIONS: OUR DIRTY SECRET By Dan Wright R ecently I received a phone call from a MUFON State Director inquiring about the morphology and known behavior of a particular alien type described to him by an alleged abductee. I had to tell the gentlemen that, amazingly, MUFON still has only a smattering of completed case reports in the critical area of alleged abductions. Moreover, we have no access to two separate abduction databases ostensibly compiled out- side our organization over the past few years. During the 1987-1991 period, when I evaluated all submitted case reports, only a tiny handful were abduction-related. To the credit of Oklahoma MUFON, each abduction case aris- ing there was promptly handled and a thorough report sub- mitted. It is more than a little disappointing that there were only a few other such reports from anywhere else in the U.S. or Canada for any time period. Consider the implication: By a fair reading of MUFON's case files, one would have to conclude that abductions rare- ly occur! I have discussed many abduction cases at length, and been present at regressive hypnosis sessions, with several promi- nent persons engaged in this area as their primary UFO pur- suit. In total, they have no doubt regressed hundreds of alleged abductees. Yet, MUFON has not received even one formal case report from them. Books have been produced, certain- ly, but not investigative reports. It is past high time for all who have held back information to submit their findings. At this point, failure to report aliens' basic physical and behavioral charactertistics is simply cheating MUFON in two crucial ways: First, field investigators do not have data they need to com- pare and contrast with other types of close encounter cases. Second, we have scores of consultants and researchers with advanced degrees in the sciences and technologies who could be called upon to evaluate various aspects of abduction cases. Yet, MUFON has little to share with them. Ten years ago, the claim was and could reasonably be made that this avenue of investigations was quite new, that there had been little time to sort and analyze the input. Fine. But, at this late date that argument no longer holds water. Personally, I am no longer willing to patiently wait several years after an event for a book which only summarizes a scant few cases determined by the author alone to be worthy of publication. For the questions usually left unanswered are critical: • How were the witnesses determined to be credible? • Did anyone check out the circumstance with police, air- ports, employers, neighbors and other acquaintances; how were these checks conducted; and what was learned? • What were the verbatim questions and responses under hypnosis? • What were the common charactertistics of those accounts ultimately determined not to be credible? Without answers, we are left to accept that all potential glit- ches were resolved satisfactorily — somehow. That collateral contacts and an on-site investigation eliminated any possibility of a psychological stimulus or outright hoax. That the hyp- notist followed a pre-hypnosis routine with the witnesses (e.g., as prescribed by Richard Haines, Ph.D). And that no leading questions or comments were uttered by the hypnotist during the sessions. T o be sure, most abduction chroniclers engage in this activity largely out of genuine concern for their clients. But, in practical terms, the effect is this: Undeniably, nearly all the individuals who have initiated or arranged hypnosis of claimed abductees have refused to share their complete findings. And that is intolerable! Perhaps these folks believe that no one else is capable of competently evaluating an abduction account. By absence of communication, that seems to be one conclusion. To the ex- tent that this reasoning is present, I believe it is grounded in vanity rather than logic. Perhaps every hypnotist engaged in this endeavor is very capable of consistently placing individuals in a genuinely hyp- notic state and extracting valid information. This, despite the fact that some of the most well known practitioners have no background in psychology or even a hypnosis training cer- tificate. Nevertheless, such ability does not necessarily translate to solid analytical skills. Frankly, we do not know whether any of them botched a given case outright with insufficient background work, poor technique or leading questions. (At least as made public, that is. No account I have ever read in a book or heard at a con- ference concluded that the initiator screwed up.) Various reasons (i.e., excuses) were offered to me over the years as to why abduction case reports have not been pro- duced. Among them: 1. // w a very time-consuming task. I agree completely. On the other hand, how long is enough? Are two or three years not sufficient? Dan Wright of Michigan is MUFON's Deputy Director, Investigations. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"2. Cases are left open for an extended period because the subject might (a) recall more details or (b) have additional experiences. By extension of this reasoning, nothing should be publicized in any form until the subject dies! No, this does not hold water, either. There comes a time to compartmentalize that segment of the subject's life and prepare a case report. Later addenda are fully acceptable. Ray Fowler's voluminous initial report on Betty Andreasson Luca and subsequent follow-ups is a prime example. 3. The person handling the case is not a MUFON field in- vestigator per se and so not subject to case reporting requirements. Let me get this straight: An individual is a member of the MUFON Board of Directors, Staff, or Advisory Board of Consultants as a validation of his/her credentials. MUFON forwards promising cases to these persons. (S)he publishes articles in the Journal, speaks at MUFON symposia or regional conferences, and/or represents us at abduction-related seminars, for invitees only, from time to time. Yet, the person feels no obligation to submit findings to MUFON for independent analysis? Authority without respon- sibility. Ah, if life could be so sweet for us all! 4. The person is concerned only with helping abductees through a traumatic period in their lives. That is certainly a magnanimous and commendable attitude. However, it is at odds with MUFON's basic mission: to gather data by which to understand the origins and purposes of alien intelligences. T his series of excuses encompasses the \"household names\" among published abduction researchers as well as others with whom I am personally familiar. But what of the less well-known researchers? Untold numbers of MUFON members in investigative positions are dabbling in abduction cases, perhaps with little or no concept of how to go about it properly. Yet, they too fail to submit their results for scrutiny. Does it even bear reminding that the individuals, or even our organization, could be sued into oblivion by a dis- gruntled client? In my 14-year association with MUFON, no aspect of the subject has had more significance than so-called \"abduction phenomena.\" From an investigative standpoint, however, these are potentially the most widely mishandled investigations. And that is caused solely by the utter secrecy of the self-appointed \"experts\" handling these cases. Given the scarcity of the data submitted, who are we to righteously accuse our federal government of withholding UFO information? Some of our own people have made it clear, either plainly or by their silence, that the rest of us are simp- ly not entitled to know either what they are up to or how they go about it! Compare this sad situation to the standard operating pro- cedure for any other UFO case: • One or more field investigators are dispatched by the state director. They engage in a discourse on methods and con- tacts to pursue. • A comprehensive report is prepared by the investigator(s) and sent to the state director for review. • After any suggested follow-ups or clarifications, it is ap- proved and sent on to the regional director for evaluation. • The regional director either approves the report or declares it to be incomplete and asks for further corroboration and resubmittal. • Having passed these tests, it is submitted for computer encoding and storage. That is proper case procedure. Over four years and 500+ case reports, I held to an infor- mal rule coined long before my time: Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence. That is, a minor investigative felling that could be overlooked in a nocturnal light case would be cited in a close encounter claim. Shockingly, there is virtually no oversight in terms of ab- duction investigations. Through the good, the bad and the ugly, these people go blithely on their way, toying with sub- ject's lives and thumbing their collective noses at procedures established by the MUFON Board. In reality, we simply do not know who all is involved or how many cases have been initiated. Is it several hundred? Is it several thousand? It should go without saying that this tragic circumstance will not be turned around overnight. As a first step, I call upon all MUFON state and provincial directors to compile, prepare and submit to Walt Andrus a brief report specifying the following: '• What persons in your state/province have ever conducted or arranged hypnosis in one or more instance of an alleged abduction? • How many cases has each person been involved in? • For each person involved, how many cases can still legitimately be considered \"open\" (i.e., in active pursuit of relevant information regarding that period of the client's life)? • How many cases engaged in by each person should be considered closed at this point? If all the hypnosis practitioners were known, such an in- quiry might be directed to them per se. Frankly, however, after so long a time with so little forthcoming, most of them should properly be regarded as investigative renegades. Ob- viously, any of them who read this article are invited to sub- mit their data — and their case reports — independently. This has been a dirty secret over the past decade. Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, I will joyfully report that MUFON is inundated with comprehensive abduction case reports. Hopefully. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ABDUCTEE MEMORY LOSS By Ginna Meyer Ginna is an Oklahoma State Section Director and Investigator. She is presently in her last year of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. While attending school Ginna has worked two years in a Post-Coronary Care Unit and for the past year has been working in the Labor and Delivery Area, Obstetrics. Ginna's interest in Ufology and abductions stem from her own experience as a seven-year-old child, with five other children. Her encounter is presently under investigation. R ecently I attended a workshop with a panel of re- covering burn patients. While listening to their stories I noted how each had coped with the traumatic ex- perience of being burned. The degree to which these in- dividuals was burned was severe, yet varied. The way each victim coped with the situation was also dissimilar. Each had developed a form of amnesia, some for a longer time span than others. One individual responded with great concern for her business and those who depended on her. She gave very specific details to her assistant on how to close down the business and how to fulfill her responsibilities to her clients. During this time the emergency medical team was respon- ding to her second and third-degree burn wounds. She stated that she was totally unaware of the severity of her situation and did not realize that she almost died. Another burn victim was able to speak of the factual in- formation of what had happened to him only after a witness, family and friends related the details to him. Unfortunately, or fortunately, as he put it, he had no recollection from ap- proximately 24 hours before the incident until approximate- ly one week before he was discharged from the hospital. He was a patient in the hospital for about three months. At the time of the narration he was still unable to recall anything about that time period. Recall After listening to the panel, I started to think about how abductees cope with their experiences. Some claim to recall approximately 80 to 90 percent of the incident without hyp- nosis, while others are, allegedly, walking around not even realizing that they have had an encounter. I, myself, am frustrated with the fact that I cannot remember but maybe five to ten percent of my experience without hyp- nosis. I am sure that some of you can relate to my situation. As a result of this I have done some research. I initially thought this form of coping mechanism might be called Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD includes certain behavioral symptoms, such as: recurrent dreams and nightmares; acting as if one is reliving the traumatic event; social numbness, withdrawl, or both; sleep disturbance; avoidance of activities perceived to arouse recollection of the event; hyperalertness or \"startle response:\" etc. It affects the thought process resulting in recurrent intrusive memories, memory impairment and trouble concentrating (Haber et al. 1987, p. 547). Haber and her colleagues define PTSD \"as a reliving of a very stressful experience, with accompanying guilt and personal dysfunction.\" Amnesia As I continued to do some light research on the subject I discovered another disorder that may be more appropriate: Dissociative Disorder. Again according to Haber et al, this refers to those reactions in which there is a sudden, temporary alteration in the normally integrated functions of con- sciousness, identity or motor behavior. Such individuals block off part of their lives from conscious recognition because of the threat of overwhelming anxiety (possibly related to a traumatic experience). One symptom of the dissociative disorder is amnesia. Amnesia is an alteration in consciousness that may include either a loss of memory for a specific period of time or a loss of all past memories. The forgotten material is still pre- sent beneath the level of consciousness and is accessible to recall at a later time (Haber et al, p. 566). My thoughts now are these: There are three theories for the inability of abductees to completely recall their ex- periences. As some of you know, abductees are allegedly given \"hypnotic suggestions\" by their abductors, so as not to remember the encounter. In itself, this may be the only reason why a good many abductees require professional hypnosis to assist them in recalling events. Personally, I doubt it. It may be more likely that it is a com- bination of the abductors' hypnotic suggestion and the above described coping mechanism of dissociative disorder resulting in varied amounts of amnesia. Or could it be that we are blaming the \"little guys\" for our inability to cope with their \"alien presence\" and that we respond with the acquired amnesia, and that they are not really giving us strong hypnotic suggestions? I doubt that the latter is true. REFERENCE D. Haber, P.P. Hoskins, A.M. Leach, and B.F. Sideleau, Comprehensive Psychiatric Nursing, 3rd edition, McGraw Hill, New York, 1987. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"JACQUES VALLEE & JOSEPH CAMPBELL By Sean Casteel J acques Vallee, in his recently released Revelations: Alien Contact and Human Deception, makes the following statement in regard to attitudes toward the UFO phen- omenon from the mainstream of science and mythology: \"The fact that the genuine UFO cases have been ignored by professional scientists, and that even the great mythologists of our time like Joseph Campbell have remained utterly blind to them, makes the phenomenon, with all its wonderful physical and psychic complexity, a convenient medium that can be sculpted with impunity by the manufacturers of alter- native theologies and the professional manipulators of the human mind.\" For those of you unfamiliar with the name of Joseph Camp- bell, he was the \"star,\" if you will, of the PBS program \"The Power of Myth,\" which consisted of six hours of Bill Moyers probing Campbell's large store of comparative mythology and ancient wisdom. Campbell is also the author of classic works of comparative mythology — the study of common threads among differing world religions — including The Hero With The Thousand Faces and the four-part The Masks of God. Admittedly, little was said by the great mythologist on the spiritual mysteries that accompany the UFO phenomenon, and Campbell himself did not consider his opinions to be truly educated on the subject. However, in a radio interview on the program \"New Dimensions,\" shortly before his death in 1987, Campbell was caught off guard by interviewer Michael Toms' question on UFOs. Michael Toms: Joseph, one of the myths that has come out of modern times, and perhaps it reflects our predilection to technology, is the UFO, the Unidentified Flying Object. And I think back to ancient times, and there were UFOs in an- cient times — there's Elijah and the fiery chariot, and the Lady of Fatima, and such as that. So, there have been UFOs, perhaps, over the centuries. How do you see UFOs? Do you see that as some recurring theme from ancient tradition? Joseph Campbell: Well, in fact, in interpreting your ques- tion, I've never seen a UFO, and don't expect to see one. But, I really don't know what to think of it, because there are cer- tain things I've heard that would indicate there may be something, you know, that it's not all an illusion. But the in- teresting thing is the fascination with it — why the fascina- tion? I'm interested also in these theories that men from outer space have come or beings from outer space have come and instituted civilizations, and the beginnings of many of our civilizations are from visitors from outer space. I think this is a continuation of something that's at the core of our religious heritage, and it's not a very good aspect of our religious heritage. Namely, that the spiritual power is from outside — it comes into us. God breathed His breath into dead Earth. But the Earth isn't dead. The Earth is alive. And matter isn't dead. Matter is alive. And matter is not anti-spiritual. Spirit can be understood as the bouquet, you know? And many of the traditions that are counter to the orthodox tradition of our world, for instance, some of the Arthurian romances, are based on the idea that the spirit is not blown into man from without, but comes forth from the living of the noble heart, that it's a quality of man himself. If we get used to the idea that spirit comes from outside in, that the savior has come from elsewhere to us, and is not a fulfillment of the potentialities of human life itself, then it may be that the fascination that more spirit, more messages, more truth, more wonder would come from outside. So that, whether there are UFOs or not, the fascination with the UFO I regard as a continuation of this notion that the spirit and the giver of the spirit and the power and the glory are \"out there\" somehow, and not right here within us. Toms: Would that be the same kind of fascination with ex- traterrestrial intelligence? Campbell: Yes, that would be the same thing, that \"out there\" would be somehow greater than here. I received a couple of very amusing phone calls from columnists in the women's pages and so forth, in New York when the rocket took pic- tures of Mars. And there were no little twinkly Martians there. I was stunned. Two phone calls saying, \"You know, this is a terrible disillusionment for people — that there are no Mar- tians. What do you think of that?\" I said, \"Well, I suppose the whole Santa Claus thing is a disillusionment, too! But disillusionment's not bad for people, after all.\" I'm not speak- ing about the possibility of there being UFOs. I was speak- ing about this fascination, and I think that it's all a function of this notion that the great power's outside and not within us. Toms: There's a popular writer of books, Eric Von Daniken, who has brought out the idea that perhaps human beings were populated from other planets, and came here to the Earth. Campbell: Well, I think actually I don't know what to say about that, because I haven't read his book, although every where I go people ask me about it. But I just don't have time, because there's so much I have to read now. Golly, this has been a period of marvelous discoveries in archeology and ethnology and historical background. And fine things are com- ing out. Casteel is a freelance writer living in Ventura, California. This is his first appearance in the Journal. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"I've just discovered a small book which I'm reading right now by a man named Chester Chard on Northeast Asia in pre-history. It's been a blank, but the Russians and Japanese have done researches there, and those aren't languages that most people in our quarters can read. This man has pulled the whole thing together, and a whole world of history opens up. Pre-history, which is particularly exciting. This is the pre- history of Alaska. You know it's from there that the crossing of the Bering landbridge happened — that was there from the vernal glaciations — and it's reading things like that that are holding me rather than these fantastic things that are com- ing out from Von Daniken. I think we know enough about evolution and we know enough about the pre-history of man — we don't know every thing but we know enough to know that kind of interpretation is unnecessary. The point here is basically one of historical record keep- ing. Vallee is without question a megastar among UFO re- searchers, and his contention that UFOs continue to rate very little respectable attention from scientists and mythologists is well-founded. But for the sake of perhaps hair-splitting ac- curacy, I thought I would offer the preceding commentary from Campbell, a master of myth and scholar of the ancient world, giving his completely off-the-cuff opinion on the UFO phenomenon. Perhaps if Campbell had lived to see the success of Com- munion and Intruders, both released in 1987, the year of his death, his opinion would have been altered by dramatic public response to the abduction phenomenon and UFOs in general. Certainly his comments were made before Zechariah Sitchin became a New Age household word. Campbell's repeated admonition that one should spend one's life \"following your bliss\" may have meaning for those in the UFO field who continue to look into the mystery that cap- tivates and even obsesses those who read this publication. This possible interweaving of historical myth with the ad- vanced technology of an alien race both fascinates and humbles those who take it seriously. Unfortunately, Campbell did not take the idea seriously, and we can only speculate as to the impact a statement from the renowned mythologist would have had on the field of UFOs and the public at large.

After a few moments the object dived and made a pass at the balloon, then proceeded to disappear. When the balloon was recovered it had a six-foot vent in it.

(Documentary movie \"UFO\" 1956) • On the 29th, two fiery discs were sighted over uranium mines located in the southern part of the Belgian Congo in the Elisabethville district, east of the Luapula River which connects the Meru and Bangweolo lakes. The discs glided in elegant curves and changed their position many times, so that from below they sometimes appeared as plates, ovals or simply lines. Suddenly, both discs stopped, hovered in one spot, then took off in a unique zig-zag flight. A penetrating hissing and buzzing sound was audible to the onlookers below. The performance lasted from 10 to 12 minutes. Commander Pierre of the small Elisabethville airport im- mediately set out in pursuit with a fighter plane. On his first approach he came within about 120 meters of one of the discs. According to his estimates, the disc had a diameter of 12 to 15 meters and was discus-shaped. The inner core remained absolutely still; a knob coming out from the center and several small openings could plainly be seen. The outer rim was com- pletely veiled in fire and must have had an enormous speed of rotation. The color of the metal was similar to that of aluminum. The discs traveled in a precise and light manner, both ver- tically and horizontally. Changes in elevation from 800 to 1000 meters could be accomplished in a few seconds; the discs often streaked down to within 20 meters of the tree tops. Pierre did not regard it possible that the discs could be manned, since the irregular speed as well as the heat would make it impossible for a person to stay inside the stable core. Pierre had to give up the pursuit after 15 minutes since both discs, with a loud whistling sound which he heard despite the noise of his own plane, disappeared in a straight line toward Lake Tanganyika. He estimated their speed at about 1500 km/hr. (Declassified CIA document 8/16/52; UFOs: A History 1952, Jan-May) • About 11:20 a.m. on the 29th, Lieutenant David C. Brigham was flying a prop-driven reconnaissance plane at 6000 feet over Northern Japan. As an F-84 jet fighter passed his aircraft he noticed a brilliant light form streaking out of the sky heading directly for the jet. The intensity of the light decreased as it approached the jet, revealing a metallic nucleus that took the form of a revolving disc-shaped object. Brigham reported, as quoted in the official Air Force Intelligence files, that the disc was \"about eight inches in diameter, very thin, round, and as shiny as polished chromium; had no apparent projections and left no exhaust trails.\" Just before it would have flown into the jet's fuselage, the disc instantly decelerated to the jet's airspeed, flipping on edge in approximately a 90-degree bank. It appeared to flut- ter about 20 feet from the fuselage for perhaps two or three seconds before it pulled away and around the right wing, ap- pearing to flip once as it hit the slipstream behind the jet's wingtip fuel tank. Brigham said it then passed the jet, pulled in front of it and then up abruptly, appearing to accelerate, and finally shot out of sight in what appeared to be a steep, almost vertical climb. Because of the proximity of the jet, Brigham was able to fairly accurately judge the distance, about 30 to 50 feet away. Although the sighting lasted only about 10 seconds, Brigham got a good look at the object. (Flying Saucers: The Startling Evidence of the Invasion From Outer Space, by Coral Lorenzen; Fate magazine, date unknown) • 1957 Victor Hancock and Guy Miller, pilots for Ten- nessee Gas Transmission Company, were flying a company DC-3 from Beaumont to Houston, Texas, when they en- countered a UFO. About 9:45 p.m. on the eighth, as they were passing over Pasadena at 1500 feet, an object with three large, white, brilliant lights crossed in front of their aircraft. \"It was going from south to north,\" said Hancock, a veteran of 12 years in the air. \"We were going at least 200 miles an hour, and it went by us easily.\" He said that it hovered; then sped off, had no navigation lights, and acted unlike an airplane. The brilliance of the object's lights kept the pilots from get- ting a definite idea of its shape. \"I still don't know what it was,\" Miller said. \"When it wanted to, it kept ahead of us easily. It would stop, or seem to stop, just under us. We would bank around, get close to it and it would be gone again.\" They got within a quarter-mile of the object. \"I got the idea that it was at least the size of our plane,\" Hancock said. \"I felt that it was just messing around with us. I know that it knew we were following it.\" The object was seen ap- proaching the Ellington Air Force Base main runway by the pilots, where it cut across military traffic. At the time the object vanished it seemed to be 200 feet over the runway, pro- ceeding southward. Hancock said the radar operator at Houston International Airport reported to him by radio that he had picked up an object close to the plane's position, then lost it. United Press reported that the \"Air Force was unable to pick up the flying object on its radar.\" (The Chronicle, Houston, TX, 3/9/57; The Star-Telegram, Fort Worth, TX, 3/9/57; The Post & Times Herald, Washington, D.C., 3/10/57; The Times, New York, NY, 3/10/57) MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"• Four UFOs, clocked over California at 3600 mph, were tracked on radar by Civil Aeronautics Administration con- trol tower operators on the night of the 23rd. At least one of the four UFOs tracked by radar was almost directly over Oxnard Air Force Base (Oxnard, CA) at this time, accord- ing to a CAA control operator's signed report. The time was 11:50 p.m. With several other CAA personnel, the radar operator was on duty in the Municipal Airport control tower at Santa Monica, California. \"I was watching the radar scope,\" his report states, \"when I noticed a target about 15 miles north- west and moving northwest. At first I thought it was a jet, then I noticed it was moving much faster than anything I had ever seen on the scope. \"About 40 miles northwest it came to an abrupt stop and reversed course, all within a period of about three seconds. It then traveled back along its course for about 20 miles, reversed course again and disappeared off the scope at 50 miles.\" Approximately five minutes later, two more unknown objects appeared, also traveling at tremendous speed. This time he quickly called on the other control tower operators to help him track the UFOs. \"These two disappeared off the scope in the same direction as the first,\" the operator said. \"We had time to clock their speed, 30 miles in 30 seconds. This figures out to 3600 mph. A minute or so later, a fourth target appeared in the same area,\" the operator said. \"It went off the scope at 3600 mph.\" • At 2:47 a.m., on the 24th, a low flying UFO with bright lights chased a Port Hueneme sailor as he was returning to Point Mugu Naval Air Station. Port Hueneme is about two miles south of Oxnard. Virgil Atkinson told sheriffs deputies that he was driving along Hueneme Road when a UFO swished down over the car and sped along in front of him, then darted around behind him and pursued him all the way to the naval station. (The UFO Investigator, NICAP, July 1957; The Star-Free Press, Ventura, CA, 3/25/57) 1962 • About 7:30 on the night of the 18th, there was a blinding flash in the sky over the desolate Mesquite Range in southern Nevada, about 70 miles south of Reno. The glare was so intense that witnesses said the streets of Reno were lighted as though by a gigantic photographic flash bulb. The glare was reported from five states. Could this thing have been a meteor, reporters inquired of the authorities at Nellis Air Force Base, near Las Vegas, Nevada? Not a meteor, certain- ly, was the official reply. This thing was being tracked on radar and followed by armed jet interceptors at the time it exploded. Other reporters reached Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Rolph of the North American Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs, Colorado. He told newsmen that a Ground Observer Corps center at Oneida, New York, had reported a red, glow- ing object moving westward at great altitude. Radar tracking had determined that it was neither plane, missile, nor meteor. The object was listed as a UFO and tracked as far west as Gridley, Kansas. It turned northwest and descended until it was lost from the radar screens. A few mintues later a UFO landed near an electrical power substation at Eureka, Utah. The Air Force spokesman at Stead Air Force Base at Reno admitted that the object had landed and that the power substa- tion had not been in operation during the 42 minutes the ob- ject was on the ground nearby. He also told newsmen that the presence of this object had not been admitted to newsmen until the power station was in operation again, after the ob- ject had left. Jet interceptors had admittedly been summoned from the base at Phoenix, Arizona, and also from Stead Field. They were pursuing the object at the time it exploded over the Mesquite Range in Nevada. All these things happened on the night of April 18, 1962, and were confirmed by official spokesmen for the U.S. Air Force. But, the story was suppressed on or by the news ser- vices. Fortunately, the Las Vegas Sun checked the story and gave it the front page banner headlines it deserved. (Strange World by Frank Edwards; Flying Saucers-Serious Business by Frank Edwards) 1967 • On the night of the fifth, an unknown flying object was tracked by an Air Force radar station near Minot, North Dakota. It was heading for one of the Minuteman grids, where the missiles are kept in deep silos, pointed skyward for launch- ing. In seconds, alarms were flashed to Minot Air Force Base and to the missile defenders, Air Force strike teams equipped with armed trucks. A minute later the UFO came into sight, a circular metallic craft over 100 feet in diameter. The missile guards, ready for action, tensely watched the descending disc. Lights flashing around the rim reflected off of a dome at the center. As the craft turned toward the nearest missile site three strike teams raced after it. Abruptly the disc stopped and hovered at 500 feet. Then it moved to an area directly over the launch control facility, the heart of the grid system. After a short pause the craft swerved upward and streaked out of sight. (Aliens From Space by Major Donald Key hoe) 1972 • A fiery cone or funnel of light startled and amazed hundreds of viewers, including at least three seasoned airline pilots, as it streaked across the evening sky over six Euro- pean countries on the 18th. It was approximately 7:20. Capt. Alexander Raab was flying his Austrian Airlines DC-9 over Linz, Austria, with 30 passengers aboard. Suddenly the direc- tion finding system experienced a break-down and warning lights flashed in the cockpit. Then he looked up, out his cockpit window. \"It was to my left, a huge white funnel in the sky. At first it was motionless. Then it seemed headed for us on a collision course. It was traveling at an unbelievable speed, its color changing from white to red. Suddenly, the object swerved in a horizontal direction away from us and to the west (toward southern Germany and France),\" Capt. Raab told airline officials later. At about the same time Raab and his crew were seeing the UFO over Linz, a Lufthansa Boenig 737 encountered it 30 miles northwest of Raab's location. Two other Lufthansa planes, one over Austria and the other over Prague, Czech- oslovakia also saw the object. Ground observers in Poland, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Austria, Germany, Switzerland and France deluged European newspapers, radio and TV stations with phone calls. Scien- tists said the object was a large meteor. But Raab brushed that explanation aside. \"I'm very familiar with all kinds of atmospheric phenomena and I've observed dozens of artificial satellites. That object did not look like a meteor. It was very distinct,\" said Raab. He added that his instruments functioned normally after the UFO disappeared. \"Why would our in- struments have gone haywire if it had been a meteor that crossed our path?\" he asked. Raab simply laughed at the meteor theory. (A.P.R.O. Bulletin, March-April 1972; National Enquirer, 10/22/72) 1982 I About 1:45 p.m. on the eighth, a bright silver disc, about 10 feet in diameter and one foot thick, was observed approaching a corporate jet on a collision course about 60 miles southwest of Allendale, South Carolina. Within a few seconds the disc passed the jet on the left side and was no more than 25 feet off the left wingtip at the same altitude. The aircraft was at 6500 feet. The pilot had 10 years flying experience and the two corporate passengers were both former Air Force pilots. (National UFO Reporting Center) CURRENT CASES Complied by Donald M. Ware Eastern Regional Director The following summarizes case reports recently received which are well-prepared and represent events of significance to ufology. Unless noted, no sound, vibration or odor was detected. All times listed are local. • Log #910401E: 22 Feb. 91: 8:00 p.m. event in Mechan- icsville, VA; investigators Mark Blashak and Don Lovett. While returning home Mr. CT, with his wife and two boys, saw a strange light. After getting out of their car at home, the object rapidly approached from the east and slowed to about five m.p.h. directly across the street. It was estimated to be about 100 feet away, just above the trees. All they saw was about 15 round white lights in the formation of a triangle. Each light was estimated to be two feet in diameter. After 10-15 seconds it departed rapidly to the north. • Log #910601E: 1954: 8:30 p.m. event 60 miles S.E. of Albany, NY; investigator Joe Barron of Gulf Breeze, FL. Witness was flying a Navy AD-4D Skyraider at 7,500 feet when he saw a row of 15 to 20 dull-yellow triangular win- dows come straight at him. They passed a few feet from his right wing. Each window appeared to be about two feet by three feet and the whole extended over an area of about 80 feet. As they went behind him, he did a rapid 180° turn, but saw nothing. • Log #91060E: 19 Sept. 1990: 9-9:30 p.m. event in Gulf Breeze, FL; investigator Joe Barron. Two witnesses observed a very bright red light come from the east to overhead where it stopped. Apparent diameter was one and '/2 fingers width at arm's length. It ejected six or eight smaller red lights. After 10 minutes it \"switched off with a loud boom. The witness called his friend who observed it from several blocks away while he spoke on a portable phone. One witness was an F-14 technician. • Log #910802E: 13 Jan. 1990: 10-minute sighting at 9:45 p.m. by a 28-year-old real estate investor, his sister, niece and friend south of Syracuse, NY. While showing friends a renovated house, they saw a bright white/orange light about 3/4 of a mile to the north. It appeared the size of a full moon. They went out back and saw a house-sized sphere that illuminated the hill at least a quarter mile in each di- rection. The object faded into blackness, and quickly, hun- dreds of little flashes running in a horizontal line a quarter mile each side of the object again illuminated the hill. The flashes winked out, starting from the ends, until only one flashing light was left. Then a vertical red streak was seen where the sphere had been. Investigators found that the ob- ject was low over an electrical transformer, and the many white flashes were probably arcing between power lines run- ning east and west. • Log #910901E: 27 July 1991: One-minute sighting at 7:25 p.m. by a 42-year-old man, his three children, and three other children in Vero Beach, FL. While watching the children, ages 8 to 12, play in a tree, the father saw a squarish, light- grey object with \"antennas\" all over it move from the southwest to the north. It was about the size of a compact car and just above the tree tops as it passed about 150 feet from them at 35 to 40 mph. After it left, they each drew what they saw. The man, who had Vietnam experience, said a helicopter circled close to the site of the encounter 30 minutes later. • Log #910902E: 6 Oct. 1990: At about 9:45 p.m., a 32-year-old salesman saw a disk-shaped object for about 20 seconds in Maiden, MA. The metallic-gray disk with six lights around the perimeter hovered over a church about 350 feet away. The lights were blue/green, orange/yellow and pur- ple/blue. When the witness got out of the car and pointed to it, it moved about 400 feet to the right in less than a sec- ond, hovered for a moment behind some trees, and then vanished. He said that as he approached the church, he could feel the presence of the object, like a vibration in his head. The other witness, who drove the car, refused to talk about it. A few minutes prior to this close sighting, both gentlemen had seen two lights in the sky that appeared too low to be stars. • Log #91U01E: 24 July 1991: 25-second sighting at 11:35 a.m. by a 49-year-old housewife while driving near Port Crane, NY; investigator, Ronald V. Hamilton. An object MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"shaped like a \"baseball cap without visor\" appearing the size of a full moon was seen through the windshield. It was sta- tionary, reflected sunlight, and looked like brushed aluminum. Then it appeared to shrink in vertical dimension to a horizontal line that disappeared. • Log #911201E: About 15 July 1985; a 15-minute sighting at 2:00 a.m. by a 25-year-old computer-aided draftsman and part-time evangelist who saw two UFOs from the rear win- dow of his home near Cobbtown, GA; investigators, Donald Ware and Chris Early. Witness was awakened by a strobing light and high-pitched noise. He saw two apparently similar objects out back, the closest about 150 feet away. It was some 70 feet in diameter with a row of white lights strobing clockwise on the outer edge and alternating red and white lights counter-clockwise a few feet from the edge. A six-or- eight sided \"opening\" was emitting white light from the center of the bottom. The object caused his tin roof to rattle, and he felt like it had him in a trance. When he managed to say \"Jesus\" it disappeared, causing the tin roof to make a loud noise. After that most of the appliances and wiring in the house were useless, and three dogs in the neighborhood were never seen again. His wife heard the noises and confirmed the effects. • Log #911203E: 23 Nov., 1990: at 8:45 p.m. a retired Air Force officer, his wife and son watched an anomalous red light over Gulf Breeze, FL for about four minutes; investigator, Joe Barron. It was stationary at about 30 degrees elevation to the north and appeared the size of a \"furniture tack\" at arm's length. The object was observed at the same time by several MUFON investigators from the south end of the Pen- sacola Bay bridge, one mile to the west. • Log #911204E: On 3 April, 1988: at 2:45 a.m. a teacher and her daughter in Gulf Breeze, FL observed through a bedroom window a UFO about 150 feet away; investigators, Vicki Lyons and Charles Flannigan. The witnesses were awakened by the sound of a dead tree falling across their backyard fence. They looked out the window and saw the ob- ject hovering about 50 feet above the ground. A circle of \"porthole-like structures\" emanated orange beams. When such a beam struck the mother it made her feel \"unique\" as if she were being seen by the occupants. The teenage daughter became afraid. Then they both laid down on the bed and held hands until they saw the light depart two hours later. The mother said she heard a throbbing sound, similar to a heart beating, during the entire sighting. The daughter heard nothing. The witnesses were neighbors of Ed and Frances Walters. (Charles Flannigan, the lead investigator at the time, did not submit a formal report in 1988 because of the workload related to the Walters' case. Vicki Lyon, then an investigator trainee, felt it was important and recently submitted a for- mal report.) • Log 1911205E; 4 April, 1991: at 4:30 a.m. a 49-year-old man saw a glowing white object with a yellow center for 15 to 20 seconds in his backyard in Pensacola, FL; investigator, Boots Eckert. He was listening to a CD in his living room when he felt a vibration and a tightness in his head that he recognized from previous UFO encounters. He went out back and saw the circular object about 3000 feet overhead. It ap- peared about three-fourths the size of a full moon and as bright as a welding torch. It then moved southeast, angled upward about 40 degrees, and zoomed out of sight in the clear night sky in about nine seconds. • Log #911206E: On 9 April 1991: at about 8:10 p.m. Robert, his wife and their 28-year-old daughter were driving east on US 98 in Gulf Breeze, FL when they saw an object \"bathed in red light\" with a circle of red lights on it; investigator, Joe Barron. At the closest point it would take four fingers at arms' length to cover the lights. Robert reported a \"heavy struc- ture\" and a surface resembling the skin of a blimp. Near the time of this sighting, about 35 attendees from the monthly Pensacola MUFON meeting observed this object from Shoreline Park South, about five miles away. (I watched for four minutes through my 30-power birding scope; while I saw the red and white light appear briefly, I did not see nearly the detail these witnesses saw. This was my third sighting of what appears to be the same type of object.) • Log #911207E: On 5 Dec. 1990: at 8:30 p.m., a couple and their four children, ages 5-12, had a 30-minute sighting from their Pensacola, FL backyard. The mother was in bed with a cold when the 11-year-old daughter said \"there is a space ship outside.\" After seeing a round, lighted object out the back window, they went outside. The object was hover- ing over the bushes near the tops of 60-foot tall trees behind two unoccupied houses across the side street. They were afraid to go closer than about 100 feet. It was described as black and silver, the size of a compact car, with bright red lights swirling around the top and a bright white light on the bot- tom. It departed slowly to the east. About an hour later, the mother went back out and saw a large helicopter flying very low and circling the neighborhood. • Log #920201E: About September 1981, a young bride was returning home at 3 a.m. with her husband, near Lithia, FL, when a UFO hovered about 50 feet over their car; investigator Fearon L. Hicks, Jr. Two lights on the UFO, that looked like an approaching car, were seen for some distance before the UFO lifted up and hovered over their car. They stopped, leaned out of the windows, and saw an undefined silvery object cover- ing the roadway and the power lines along the side. Her next recollection is waking up in bed the next morning. She had a rash on her left arm, neck, and the side of her chest. The area where the rash was still becomes dark red when exposed to heat, but does not cause discomfort. The witness's sister also suspects UFO encounters. Continued on page 19 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Dear Editor: Terence Meaden's letter in the January 1992 issue of the Mufon UFO Journal, in which he castigates George Wingfield for some scientific lapses in an earlier letter (May 1991), is a prime example of an all- too-common failing in science: its refusal to consider all the available evidence, and its concomitant tendency to form reductive theories in advance of the facts. I pass over the scientific lapses, since they have no real bearing on Mr. Meaden's case, and take up his points in the order made. 1.) Plasma vortices may exist, and there may even be cold plasma vortices that would not burn crops (a point he does not discuss), but Meaden cannot have the cause both ways. He cannot at one point say that a hill or obstacle \"is not an essential requirement\" to form the upspinning eddy-vortex that breaks downward to form crop patterns and then con- tinue to argue that windfields generate eddies when they en- counter obstacles. All the accounts of vortex formation in paragraph 4 of his letter involve an \"invading windfield as it butts against and flows around the hill ...\" The unpleasant fact is that a very large number of crop patterns, including those of 1991, were not formed in the lee of any hill or of any obstacle large enough to create the requisite eddy. A vortex theory must apply equally to situations with and without an obstacle. Because Meaden's theory cannot accommodate the facts, he notes the possibility of non-obstacle formation and then lets it die silently. 2.) Meaden dismisses the large increase in crop patterns in the past few years as due primarily to hoaxing and secon- darily to increased public awareness. I deal only with hoaxing. That there have been a few hoaxes, mostly crude and mostly discovered, cannot be stretched by fiat to cover the enormous number of very well documented crop patterns. It would be a physical impossibility for a small army — let alone two men — to create these complex patterns in all kinds of weather and lighting. Even Dr. Yoshi-Hiko Ohtsuki of Waseda Univer- sity, whom Meaden cites in support of the plasma vortex theory, does not subscribe to his version of the hoax theory. In a Japanese NTV network documentary on \"Mystery Circles\" broadcast on October 3, 1991, Dr. Ohtsuki stated that circles made by human hand were in his opinion \"shab- by\" (kitanai in Japanese) whereas true circles were beauti- fully formed, and even elegantly made hoaxes did not \"shine\" (hikatte inai) from the air the way true circles did (pre- sumably due to the violent and irregular way the former were laid down). Dr. Ohtsuki's statement was in response to the claim by two Englishmen to have hoaxed the crop circles. It was clear he did not consider the vast majority of circles hoaxed. The hoax theory is more important to Meaden than appears. Without it, his plasma vortex must plausibly explain: a) the multi-stage construction of the patterns; b) the increasing complexity and intelligence of the patterns; c) the physical and chemical changes in the plants; and d) the extreme rapidity of formation under relative calm or windless conditions. LETTERS 3.) Meaden states that the \"generalized plasma vortex theory is well and getting healthier with each year that passes.\" That, of course, is only PR. The specific problems advancing on his generalised theory are even healthier and growing with each year, as recent articles in the Journal demonstrate. There may be a natural explanation for the phenomenon, but the time for theories is not yet here. First facts, then theories. One would like to see a little more respect for Newton's \"Hypotheses non fingo.\" 4.) Meaden notes that his book, The Goddess of the Stones, has extended the plasma votex theory back to the Neolithic Age. Other scholars have not been impressed with the attempt. Christopher Chippingdale, editor of Antiquity, reviewed it in the Times Literary Supplement (Oct. 18, 1991) and noted that its engaging (and politically correct) picture of a prehistoric Britain that worshipped a Great Goddess and lived in peaceful coexistence is not supported by any evidence. His general sum- mary of the book as archaeology is worth quoting: \"The preface to the book is a self-promoting puff, its treatment of evidence is quite unfair, and the whole performance is calculated to reduce confidence in that science of which the author is so proud\" (p. 7). 5.) Meaden stresses that very few crop circles were seen before 1980. This may be so, but is unsupported. Lack of reports is no confirmation of lack of existence. On the con- trary, one would certainly expect a natural phenomenon like the plasma vortex to be well known throughout history the way, say, dust devils are. But if you attribute the majority of circles since Meaden's own research began in 1980 to hoaxes, then the evidence has been quite nicely cooked in his favor. — Steven J. Willett MUFON Consultant Hamakita City Japan CURRENT CASES, Continued • Log #920203E: 19 Jan. 91, at 8:30 p.m. a 31-year-old respiratory therapist in Bridgeport, CT saw a UFO hovering over and slightly beyond a 35-foot-tall tree across the street about 360 feet away; investigators Anastasia Wietrzychowski and Bob Elmore. The object was a domed disk with a large square \"window\" on the upper portion emitting brilliant white light. Two smaller \"windows\" emitted dimmer white light, and the object appeared to be outlined by white light. A truck passed, backed up and stopped. The light dis- appeared and reappeared in another location. The witness observed this for about 30 seconds through a glass door while talking on the phone, and static was reported. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Dear Editor: R. H. Coddington's letter that appeared in the February 1992 issue was one of the best to date that I have had the pleasure of reading in your column. His brevity and sincerity in ad- dressing a situation that has gotten out of hand within the pages of our Journal is to be applauded. I, like anyone else, appreciate a good discussion, but when it comes to \"nitpicking\" and \"I'd like to point outs,\" I would prefer reading articles concerning UFOs and the latest updates. These knights who are swinging wildly with their broad swords, clashing up against each other's shields, are causing too much noise and commotion. When the dust clears, most of us are really unsure what the joust was all about: ego-deflation, character assassination, witness tampering? Who cares!? As a suggestion, you could print the address of the article's author, that way those who wish to point \"this or that\" out, could then correspond directly with the author and save the pages of our Journal for more construc- tive purpose's. I am sure that either you or Walt Andrus will insert a disclaimer to any article that you are unsure of. I seem to recall a couple of issues back that you wrote about this very same situation and in,so many words said that this type of abuse of our Journal would cease. I hope you can get control of this soon, it has gone on for too long as it is. \"Sheathe your swords, gentlemen, the battle is not within our ranks, but in the halls of our representatives and government.\" — Fearon L. Hicks State Section Director Auburndale, FL (As mentioned earlier, human beings what they are, we don't anticipate that personality disputes will vanish overnight. Nor do we expect everyone to agree on a single viewpoint or inter- pretation of the UFO phenomenon. Honest and open debate on the issues and data must go forward. In the future, however, feature articles must let the facts speak for themselves. More opinionated pieces, if they appear at all, will be confined to the letters column. We're not trying to stifle debate in the Jour- nal's pages; we're just trying to raise the plane on which it takes place.) Dear Editor: I enjoyed Bill Hamilton's article on the sightings in the Antelope Valley, and wish to add some information. I was there in the same area, late April 1991, and spent a night within view of the Northrop facility with CBS, Bill Hamilton and a dozen or so other watchers. I saw, and filmed several orange-tinged UFOs in 16mm, and these are similar to what Bill has des- cribed. They also change form as they fly, upon analysis. What is even more intriguing is that the next day, on leaving the area (I was the last one left at dawn), I was driving out and I stopped to chat with two other watchers who were driving back up. As we talked, I had what seems to be a very abnormal sighting. I saw a glint, and noted a bright disk high up, perhaps at 5000 feet, which seemed to act as if it wanted me to notice it. So I grabbed my binoculars and watched it. As soon as I did, this object changed. It suddenly became a flying set of white wings, perhaps 200 feet wide. These were similar to an eagle's wings, not a \"flying wing.\" There was no head, nor tail, just giant flapping wings, with feathery tips. Amazed, I dove for my movie camera. When I raised this up, it was — zap — gone. The other two men saw nothing, except for the first glint. I did have some sleep that night, so I cannot blame this on lack of sleep. I am also a keen observer. I now think I know why the military is not concerned that we see things. What we see is so fantasic and unbelievable that — just like tales of abductions — even if we tell the people, they can't grasp it, and they don't believe what we tell them anyway. — Jon Erik Beckjord Malibu, CA NEW RELEASES Several new items arrived too late for review this issue. The first is The Summer 1991 Crop Circles: The Data Emerges, by Michael Chorost, published by the Fund for UFO Research, Box 277, Mount Rainier, MD, 20712 ($25, plus $2.50 p&h, $5 foreign). A condensed version of this report originally appeared in the October 1991 issue of the Journal. The final expanded report runs to 73 pages and contains much new material, in- cluding several other photographs, technical appendices, and a partial catalog of crop circles with diagrams of some of the many various patterns and formations. There is much to mull over here. The second item is Secret Life: Firsthand Accounts of UFO Abductions by David M. Jacobs, Ph.D. (see elsewhere in this issue for the Foreward by John E. Mack, M.D.), which is now or soon to be available from Simon & Schuster, 336 pages, $21.00. The official publication date is March 12, 1992. Jacobs, of course, is a familiar contributor to these pages. A professor of history at Temple University, he is the author of The UFO Controversy in America, one of the true landmark classics in the field. The third is Cropcircle Communique, a stunning 77-minute video on the crop circle phenomenon by Englishman John Mac- Nish, with soundtrack by John Thomas and Emily Burridge. This is a top-flight, Hi-Fi VHS stereo production, sure to stun even the most jaded skeptic wide awake. Can't be recommended too highly. Write to the American distributor, Linda Moulton Howe, for specifics: P.O. Box 538, Huntingdon Valley, PA, 19006-0538. Tel: (215) 938-7869. Chorost's report is available directly from the Fund. Jacobs' book should be in your local book store soon. In the mean- time, an always reliable source for any UFO publication or related material, including videos, is Bob Girard's Arcturus Book Service, P.O.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"A LETTER TO READERS OF 'REVELATIONS' by Jacques Vallee In the Sept./Oct. 91 issue of its magazine, known as IUR (the International UFO Reporter), the Center for UFO Studies has published a review of my most recent book, Revelations, signed by Jerome Clark. It claims that (1) the book contains errors in names and citations, (2) its summary of alleged crashes is \"a disaster\" because several dates are wrong, (3) it pays too much attention to claims that should be summari- ly dismissed as fraudulent, (4) it does not reveal the names of all sources and (5) it fails to quote ufologists with differ- ing views. These claims, except for the very first one, are false. (1) I have relied too much on memory and I have occasional- ly fallen victim to typos. For instance, CUFOS has indeed moved to Chicago rather than staying a few miles away in Evanston. Dr. Bronk's first name should be spelled Detlev, not Detley (it is spelled correctly in the index). Two letters got inverted in Jamison's name and I did not catch it. And it is undoubtedly true that JUFOS (the Journal of UFO Studies) is a refereed journal. (2) Crash data are notoriously unreliable, as IUR itself has often pointed out. However my \"1933 or 1934\" date for Ubatuba was not a typo. Similarly, from the data I have I must stand by the quoted date of May 1947 for the Spitzbergen crash. (3) It is true that I did not castigate the claims of John Lear, Bill Cooper and Bob Lazar as outright frauds. I believe that these men are wrong but I cannot conclude that they lie. Somebody is using Lazar. Somebody invented the MJ-12 documents. Somebody typed the papers that Richard Doty gave Linda Howe. I did not hesitate, on the other hand, to denounce the Meier case and the Ed Walters claims. (4) I am being taken to task for suggesting that Len Stringfield should have revealed his sources' names, then neglecting to publish my own. This is another bad faith argu- ment. I have never implied that Mr. Stringfield should violate the trust of his informants by making their names public in a book, and I certainly will not be guilty of such a violation myself. In fact the very same issue of IUR prints an interesting article by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, hinting at unnamed infor- mants. My argument with Mr. Stringfield's sources is that bona fide independent scientists have not been able to talk to them on a confidential basis. How do we know that we are not simply dealing with another \"Aviary?\" (5) As for the claim that the book fails to mention con- trasting views, I believe it is equally unfounded. Many such researchers were cited verbatim. On page 216 I even quoted Jerome Clark's interview with the Hartford Courant, where he summarily dismissed the Voronezh case, one of the most important UFO events of the last ten years. CLARK RESPONDS Several individuals have been kind enough to send me copies of Jacques Vallee's privately circulated A Letter to Readers of 'Revelations! a response of sorts to my review of his most re- cent book (see \"Somebody Must Be Behind It,\" IUR, September/October 1991). There is nothing in Vallee's remarks to cause me to reconsider or withdraw any of my criticisms. Those who have read both Revelations and \"Somebody\" may judge for themselves whether Vallee has addressed my major arguments and, if so, how successfully. From my perspective Vallee seems fixated on small points while studiously avoiding the larger ones, most notably my charge that he has made extraordinary conspiratorial claims which neither logic nor evidence begins to validate. Where cover-up yarns are concerned, Vallee has missed my point: that when one enters this treacherous area, one ought to realize that there are elements not only of disinformation but of plain, old-fashioned con-jobbing. This issue is'discussed on page 22, first column, second and third paragraphs, of my IUR review. I did not claim, as Vallee has it, that Revelations simply \"fails to mention contrasting views.\" My charge, a far more damning one, was that Vallee is unfamiliar with — in other words, ig- norant of — the most intellectually serious writing ufology has produced in the last decade or so; thus, when he attacks ufologists as he does relentlessly, he does not always know whereof he speaks. Vallee unintentionally makes my point when all he can cite to rebut this \"unfounded\" claim is, for God's sake, a newspaper clipping, usually not regarded as a reliable source, in which I am briefly, and distortedly, quoted. Right or wrong, my views on UFO matters are voluminously documented in my many writings, which Vallee could have con- sulted if he wanted to level substantive criticism. That may be Vallee's problem in a nutshell: reading clippings when he should be studying actual UFO literature. For my views on the Voronezh case, see my UFOs in the 1980s, pages 213-14. As for Vallee's statement that this is \"one of the most important UFO events in the last 10 years,\" I hope he's right. All I can say in the mean- time is, let's see the evidence. If Vallee wants to believe the Ubatuba incident occurred in \"1933 or 1934,\" he is welcome to do so. The rest of us can turn to the relevant literature (e.g., Coral Lorenzen's The Great Fly- ing Saucer Hoax, page 90) and learn, or be reminded, that the event allegedly took place in late August or early September 1957. The Spitzbergen crash, for which Vallee falsely cites Dorothy Kilgallen as source (and adds the equally untrue asser- tion that she mentioned bodies in association with flying discs), first appeared in print in the June 28, 1952 issue of Germany's Saarbrucker Zeitung. It is, European researchers who present- ly will be publishing the results of their investigation tell me, a virtually certain hoax. Vallee also mentions the famous Tex/Mex crash, listing the date as 1948, evidently unaware that investigators long ago con- cluded this was incorrect and put it later, in December 1950. The guy who hoaxed the MJ-12 document, incidentally, knew as much. Vallee should, too. And, by the way, Vallee to the con- trary, the genesis of the story is not vague at all; the names of the Army informants from whom Todd Zechel got the tale have been known for years. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 287 March 1992"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb April 1992 • Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -2.3), in Leo, stands high in the SE at dusk. The conspicuous planet moves westward during the night. The gibbous Moon lies in its vicinity on the 12th and 13th. • Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) can be seen only early in the month very low in the E just before sunrise. Mars (1.1), in Aquarius, rises l'/2 hours before the Sun and lies in the ESE during midtwilight. The ruddy world is near the lunar crescent on April 28 and 29. Jupiter sets in the W shortly after 4 AM daylight time in midmonth. Saturn (0.8), in Capricornus, rises about 3:30 AM in mid- April and can be found low in the SE at dawn. The Moon is nearby on the 25th and 26th. • Meteor Shower The Lyrids unfortunately attain maximum this year when the gibbous Moon is also in the morning sky. Many of these white meteors will be washed out by the moonlight. Nor- mally, a rate of about 15 per hour might be seen toward dawn on April 21 and 22. • Moon Phases: New moon — April 3 First quarter — April 10 Full moon — April 17 Last quarter — April 24 • The Stars: Leo the Lion crosses the meridian during midevening hours. Leo, its primary star Regulus, and the planet Jupiter all occupy the same region of the heavens this spring. The gathering would have been highly symbolic in ancient times. The celestial lion, the star, and the king of planets all signified royality and kingship. The Egyptian sphinx, with its human face and body of a lion, may have been modeled after the starry outline of Leo, associating the royal power of the kings with the constellation. Also known to the Egyp- tians: Their all-important day star, the Sun, appeared to pass very near Regulus on the first day of summer. The Lion contains another guest this month — the minor planet Vesta, which can be found about 2° NW of Theta Leonis, the hind quarters of Leo. Vesta's passage by a slightly dimmer star can be watched through binoculars around April 18 and 19. Vesta (magnitude 6.6) is located on the 17th at R.A. llh 09m, Dec. +17°07' (2000 coor- dinates). Note how the object's position changes each night relative to the star. UFO investigators should be alert for the refractive effects of rising and setting bright stars (and planets), especially Vega, rising in the NE about 9 PM daylight time in mid- month, and Sirius, setting in the WSW about 11 PM. RED UFO RETURNS by Glen Bradley Saturday, January 25, 1992. As a professional in the field of psychology, the continuing reports of UFO sightings from residents in Pensacola Beach and Gulf Breeze area piqued my curiosity. Could these people be seeing real UFOs? On this night I joined a group of people at South Shoreline Park in Gulf Breeze who gather nightly for the purpose of hopefully witnessing a UFO. These people were very normal. No guru or cult was in evidence, just friendly curious people like myself, looking for an answer to the local UFO mystery. Suddenly somebody asked, \"Is that an airplane?\" I am an active private pilot myself, having flown airplanes since the age of fifteen. I looked to the east and saw something that was not like any airplane I had ever seen. It was a very large red light of great intensity moving slowly to the south (into the wind). It appeared to be about eight miles away; it was a very clear night. As this glowing, red unidentified flying object moved to the south, another identical red light appeared below and to its left. This second brilliant red light faded in and out occa- sionally, while the first light disappeared behind the trees that were almost in front of me. About a minute had gone by — it was 7:55 p.m. — when I was handed a pair of binoculars so that I could see the ob- ject in more detail. Through the binoculars the light's inten- sity was really impressive; it had a very consistent reddish- orange glow, much like that of a ruby laser. It was not at all like any light I had seen in over 20 years and some 40,000-plus hours of flying. I was impressed! Several Mutual UFO Network investigators were busy photographing and recording the sighting. Investigator Mar- sha Athey used a car phone to call another team of in- vestigators who were stationed near Fort Pickens. Chief In- vestigator Gary Watson acknowledged that he could also see the red glowing object and was able to triangulate the loca- tion of the object (later calculated to be 6 and !4 miles east of our location). Dozens of photographs were taken, including some with two 1000mm lens cameras and a video camera. I look for- ward to the detail the photos will provide. They often show that the light is really a reddish-orange ring of great intensity. The above article originally appeared in The Islander of Pensacola, Florida, on January 31, 1992.

The Top Ten The computer membership list for January 31, 1992 ranked the leading states in the following order with a few revisions from the November standing: California, 378 (192 in northern California and 186 in southern California); Texas 266; Florida 229; New York 163; Dlinois 146; Massachusetts 106; Michigan 100; Pennsylvania 94; Ohio 92 and Maryland 89. Rounding out the top ten above, other active states close behind were Washington 88, Missouri 83, Virginia 80, New Jersey 78, North Carolina 72, Connecticut 61 and Arizona 56. Fully recognizing that the overall population of a state could directly influence the number of members, the State Directors and their teams are to be congratulated for their leadership. Next month we will concentrate on the smaller states, population-wise, where strong leadership could make signifi- cant differences. To be an effective UFO investigative organization, one of our goals is to have a state section director responsible for every county in the U.S.A. Geographically, the smaller states in size have an advantage, compared to Texas, California, New York and obviously Alaska. Jim Moseley Donates Private Collection The January 20, 1992 edition of the Key West Citizen newspaper announced that Jim Moseley of Rose Lane Gardens had made a rare gift to the Broward County Archaeological Society worth approximately $85,000. The special exhibit of pre-Columbian artifacts from Mr. Moseley's private collec- tion opened at the Museum of Archaelogy in Fort Lauder- dale, FL. According to Moseley, this is the largest collection of miniature Peruvian ceramics in the United States. Jim per- sonally collected the donated pottery and gold artifacts while on an expedition to Peru during the late 1950s. The Broward County Archaelogical Society has named the \"Moseley Ex- hibit\" in honor of the Key West Donor. James W. Moseley is best known in ufological circles as the editor of the controversial and humorous privately publish- ed newsletter Saucer Smear. Mr. Moseley is to be commended for this fabulous donation for posterity. As Jim would say in Saucer Smear \"way to go, Jim.\" COMMUNICATING BY MODEM If you have a computer and modem why not log on to the MUFON Bulletin Board System Network? As system administrator I highly recommend this form of electronic communication as a way for individual members and groups to keep in touch with one another between Journals. The requirements are really quite simple: • Use a modem which is \"Hayes\" compatible. • Communications settings should be 8 bit, no parity, 1 stop bit (8-N-l). • Your communications program should provide \"ANSI\" terminal emulation. • The monitor you are using should provide 80-column display. • Modem baud rate must be a minimum of 300 baud; 1200 is acceptable, but 2400 baud would be ideal. For those members who feel communication by com- puter might be too technical, not to fear. With the array of communications programs currently available, connect- ing with a BBS over a telephone line is not nearly as com- plicated as it once was. Those members interested in ac- cessing this type of communications media should write to me at the address below, and I'll be happy to forward an \"On-Line Guide\" which explains what is involved and the information available. Or log on to the data number shown and leave me a message. We are constantly seeking information concerning UFOs and related topics. I would like to request each State Director to please include me on their mailing list for local newsletters and any articles in which they think other members may be interested. Also, if you or a member of your state group is interested in becoming more ac- tively involved with the MUFON-BBS Network, please contact me directly.
