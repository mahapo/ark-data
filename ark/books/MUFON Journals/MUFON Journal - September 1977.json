FROM THE EDITOR As this is being written, the early reports are in following preview screenings of the Columbia Pictures film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". Apparently it faithfully follows the,general types of things that have been reported, and uses them as a basis for philosophising about the import of UFO phenomena for mankind. The close association of Dr. J. Allen Hynek and the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) with this potentially blockbuster film leads us to two predictions for 1978: The film will be highly influential in calling attention to UFOs as a matter of profound significance, and CUFOS will obtain the leverage and support to play a stronger role in guiding future research. This, in turn, probably will affect .the course of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) low-key study now underway. The word is out that NASA has been instructed to report phenomena back to President Jimmy Carter on what sort of UFO study would be appropriate at this time. A strong^ reaction to the film clearly would boost the prospects for a meaningful NASA UFO project.

Duration: 3% minutes \" Reporter: High school science teacher. Male. Age 36 years. PhD in organic chemistry. Name withheld on his request. Available on file. Account: \"I was driving along the Birdwood-Williamstown road about 5 km from Birdwood when I noticed an object in the sky. I thought for a moment that it was an aircraft, but then I realized that it was not. It was descending from an altitude of 1-2 km at a 15-20 ° glide path. As it approached the ground its nose lowered and it settled between a clump of trees and a power pylon about 400 meters from the road. As I got out of my car a cream colored 1969 or 1970 Torana stopped behind me and the driver got out and shouted, \"Did you see that?\". I replied that I still could and pointed it out to him. We observed the object for 3 minutes and during this time I took particular note 1 of the position of the object and other reference points so that I would be able to estimate its size and location. It then raised its tail a little and slid backwards and upwards a little, then it accelerated .vertically, to disappear in three seconds. I calculated its vertical velocity to be on the order of 6000 kph. At no time did it emit any light or sound. Its descent and departure did not seem even to disturb the foliage of the trees. Its ascent was also noiseless — not even a supersonic 'bang'.\" Comments by Reporter: \"I would estimate the average part of it to be 5-9 meters in height, length 50- 60 meters, and I would conjecture that its width would have been in the 20 meter mark...Its width being about one third/of its length.\" \"There was an object, light pink in color...a satin finish...I don't think it had any source of its own.\" (See sketches). Investigation: UFO Research Inc. of South Australia has interviewed the prime reporter on several occasions, inspected the location with no abnormalities on/to the ground being noted, interviewed farmers to both sides of the location without locating additional reporters, and is seeking the identity of the additional witnesses.

Mount Real is in fact a small hill overhanging the surroundings, heavily wooded with pine and fir trees and with thick underbrush. Here and there are small clearings. It is. a lonely spot crossed only by small footpaths. At this hour and month, the sun is low and still visible.    - On this day, the sky being somewhat cloudy, the visibility good, with no wind, Mr. A (who wishes to remain anonymous) was- searching for mushrooms, and had very rapidly filled a whole basket with them. Entering a small clearing, he noted a big \"nest\" of mushrooms and bent down to look at them. Straightening up, he glimpsed at the edge of the clearing a small being about 4 feet (1.20 meters) tall, who seemed to grab something on the ground. A second similar being emerged from the brush behind the first. They looked like twins, so similar was their appearance. Mr. A. took them for children at first, shouting to them that they could collect plenty of mushrooms there. They both stared at him from a distance of 80-100 feet (25-30 meters). Their feet were not visible, being concealed by the weeds. At this point, both of them seemed to laugh at the witness, audibly, and they turned and fled into the underbrush behind them, bending down beneath an overhanging branch as they left. Mr. A. thought they had decided to go get a basket to gather mushrooms. The beings had arms like ours (not longer proportionally), and they walked in human fashion, without difficulty. They wore beige colored overalls up to the neck, with no visible pockets or other openings. They were barer handed, with human-like hands. The overalls covered the arms to the wrists. Their limbs were slender. On their heads were black berets; ho ears were visible, but their features.were entirely normal otherwise.   J Two or three seconds after their departure (perhaps a little longer, the estimation of time by Mr.. A. not being very accurate), a large oval object rose from behind the brush where the two beings had disappeared. .It was dull blue-gray, not self-luminous, without apertures or visible markings, and was about 70 feet (20 meters) away. It was about 17 feet (5 meters) long and 7 feet (2 meters) high. The UFO rose slowly and vertically, making a slight whistle, to a height of about 20 feet (6 meters) carrying up dead leaves from the ground. Here it stopped for about a second, then dashed away horizontally at a high rate of speed in total silence, directly to Mount Ventoux to the northeast. Mr. A. was puzzled by the rapidity of departure immediately after the disappearance of the two small creatures. The trees around the landing site were about 8 feet (2.5 meters) tall, therefore concealing the landed object. It is noteworthy that, to the witness, the two dwarf-like beings had to be Chinese • spies! (He cannot understand that they could be not of this world, a detail that lends strong credence to this case). At the landing site the grass and a bush were flattened, and Mr. A. thought the object must have been hovering a foot or two (less than a meter) above the ground. (1) There have been many cases like this throughout' the world in the past 30 years. Note the striking similarity to the 1964 Socorro, N.M. case. (2) The apparent \"laugh\" of the beings also has been noted in several cases, particularly in the Cennina, Italy, landing on November 1, 1954 reported by Sergio Conti in Flying Saucer Review. (3) One of the two beings in that case \"was . the more jovial, laughing...\" In a May 1946 landing case near Angelholm, Sweden, both male and female occupants were observed. One of the females threw an object outside the area of light around the UFO and, says the witness, \"I heard her laugh.\" (4) My files contain at least six other cases in which a humanoid was seen laughing.

The sighting took place at 8:40 PM, February 11, 1977, at Gaberke, only about 15 meters away from the house of the chief eyewitness. There are also other witnesses of this phenomenon: Andrej Gorsek, 6, Zoran Gorsek, 4, and the unknown professional driver who happened to be near the eventual landing place at that time. We have not contacted this witness yet, but we have obtained tape-recorded statements from three other witnesses. We quote herewith a part of this recording: UFO section: Can you describe for us your observation of the unknown phenomenon? Slavka Gorsek: It happened at 8:40 PM on February 11, when I decided to take my night's rest. With my two children, Andrej and Zoran, I went to the bedroom. My husband was working that evening. We were standing beside my bed when suddenly an intense white beam of light came through the window. For a moment it lightened the room so throughly that it became as bright as broad daylight. It lasted for a second and the light disappeared. UFO section:What was your reaction that moment and what do you remember about the object that was obviously the source of this light? Slavka Gorsek: The light was coming from the glowing egg-shaped object that landed behind the ken-house, some 15 meters from the house. At the time of the landing, I did not get a perfectly clear picture of it. My children and I, we became very scared by what we saw. First I thought of a fire, but later I began to fear that something would explode any moment. I was afraid of some supernatural power because I have never had such an experience in my life. UFO section: What happened after the object had landed and disappeared from your field of vision? Slavka Gorsek: Nothing at all happened in the next two minutes. There was no light to be seen anymore. The.object had probably extinguished. There was no sound to be heard coming from the object either. And, then the object flashed up again. It made a vertical take-off and flew away. This time I made a closer observation of its take-off because I anticipated it. But I must point out that the three of us, we were very frightened all that time and even long after the event. UFO section: Describe for us the shape, size and color of the object as it was taking off. Slavka Gorsek: First let me tell you that the object probably emitted the same quantity of light when taking off as it had done when landing. The object was egg-shaped, 2.5-3.5 meters wide (about 8 to 11 feet). A luminous white glow was coming from its outer edge. Then came a very bright bluish colored stripe, encircling the exact center which was dominated by a field of blue color. On this area I spotted three more or less circular bright spots, of similar shape, more or less regularly spaced. The whole object was emitting an intense glow, but the outlines of the object were nevertheless sharp. (Author's Note: Andrej and Zoran Gorsek gave similar descriptions of this phenomenon; they only disagreed that the object's center was blue-colored: in their opinion, the color was rather greenish). UFO section: What happened after the object took off?  • • Slavka Gorsek:The object disappeared and we did not see it anymore. We were so scared that we could not fall asleep. We went to the living room to watch TV and wait for my husband to return from work. I did not leave the house that evening to have a look at the landing spotrand possibly see the landing traces, because I did not By Milos Krmelj think of them at all. Accidentally,' I spotted the traces only the third 'evening after this event, when I noticed a glimmering dust at the landing site. The members of the UFO section, together with an APRO representative in Yugoslavia (who is founder of this section at SOLT Union) made a careful investigation of the landing site and its traces. We obtained the following additional technical data: The object was from 2.85 to 3.85 meters long. The greatest distance between the legs of the object was 2.85 meters, but we allow a tolerance that the legs were shifted for nearly 50 centimeters inwards. The object was elliptical, its section being like that of a right ellipse, the diameters being in the proportion of 2 to 1. When the object was performing a vertical take-off, it was in the field of vision of the eye- witness. The object moved in a steady motion, without any acceleration. With the assistance of the time estimation and distance, we calculated, the object's rate of speed to be between 2.5 and 3.5 meters per second during take- off. The object landed on a ground inclined at an angle of 22° toward the eastern part of the property. The landing spot was a small field, and the slope is overgrown with grass. The illuminating power of the object was constant' and its shape and color underwent no changes whatsoever. No sound was heard coming from the object. Material traces.of the landing After the event, the eyewitness marked the landing traces of the legs by placing sticks into those spots. The object had five landing legs. The legs formed a pentagon, the straight lines of which were on an average 2.4 meters long. Each leg was composed of three tube-shaped segments. The thickness of these \"tubes\" was one millimeter and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the \"tube's\" diameter was 5.4 centimeters. The segments formed a triangle, the straight side of which was ,..13.7 cm long; but this was true for the four legs only, while at the fifth leg, the .. three \"tubes\" were closer attached to . each other. The traces of these \"tubular\" segments are all seen on the photographs. Unfortunately, these traces have been partially wiped out so that it is rather difficult to notice the traces of all the three segments on the photograph at the same time. The additional photographs were snapped at the time plaster casts of one of the 15 segments were made. The glimmering dust left by the UFO In the conversation, the eyewitness also mentioned that she noticed a silvery glimmering dust at the landing site. Her opinion is that it was left by the UFO. This dust she spotted at night when she tried to illuminate the landing site with her pocket-lamp. The dust was more intensely sprinkled on those spots that indicated the traces of the landing legs. When investigating the landing site we obtained specimens of this dust and submitted them to analysis at the most competent Slovene research institution. The soil specimens also were given a biological growth test. We tested monocotyledonous plants as well as dicotyledonous ones using soil taken from the spot indicated by the holes made by the legs, and from locations near the landing site. The results proved to be negative at first, but later some changes in growth were observed as seen in one of the photographs. This is hot conclusive. The chemical composition of the soil did not undergo greater changes that could affect the growth of monocotyledonous plants (corn) or dicotyledonous plants (beans). Even if these plants had acted like there were some changes in chemical composition, it must be remembered that only one experiment was made, not fifty, which it might take to prove some influence of \"UFO polluted\" soil on the plants' growth. We have also made a simple test for detecting radioactivity at the landing spot. The results were again negative, but we cannot say whether the ground absorbed a lesser quantity of it because our test was not sensitive enough to detect it. It is also possible that the traces were radioactive only for a shorter period of time (a few hours) or that radioactivity did not exist at all. Inaccuracies: We happened to be in the middle of our investigation, when we were very surprised upon reading the article on the back page of the provincial weekly \"Novi Tednik\", dated April 21, 1977. The article introduces this case to the inhabitants of the Stajerska region. We discovered at once the following misinterpretation? or inaccuracies: 1. The writer says that the object had six legs. We established that there were only five traces, hence there were only five legs. It is not clear to us where the writer came up with the sixth one. 2. The scales were not bronze colored (moreover, they were not \"scales\" but dust), but they were glittering silvery. 3. The object never proved to be 6.5 meters long, 3 meters high and about 3 meters wide. In reality all these extensions were much lesser, as we have already stated in our report. 4. The description of the object's color also disagrees with the fact because the The Landing Site object did not :glow reddish. 5. We, \"the special commission from Ljubljana\", as the writer of this article called us, did not issue a statement that the soil was harmless for growing plants, because from time to time we will have to visit the spot and follow.up on the growth of the plants. (Already in the beginning of July, 1977, we again visited the landing site and found the grass growing normally.) What were the results of the soil analysis? When we got hold of the soil specimens, we asked for help from the experts at the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana. They kindly put the specimens to an analysis. With the permission of the Institute, we quote the results of analysis: Specimen in the smaller glass bottle (little sheets). Basis: Fe (iron), Mg (magnesium), Si (silicon). Admixtures: Ca (calcium), Al (aluminum), Mn (manganese). Traces of chemical elements: Al, Na (sodium), Cu (copper). Specimen in the bigger glass bottle (soil with glittering particles).

Commentary of the UFO section of the Solt Union The case deserved enough attention so that we devoted to it a lot of time as well as considerable means for its investigation. Most probably it is our only UFO case that has left us with material traces that our UFO section took note of and more or less quickly investigated. Our opinion is that it is not a matter of fraud with which the eyewitness would have made fun of our section. Still we somehow feel frustrated about this case because we cannot prove its authenticity with the lie detector or even with regressive hypnosis which might bring us more reliable results. But in any case, we do not see any reason or motive for fraud since we are experienced in detecting the authenticity of UFO sightings. The phenomenon itself is far from being a unique one. From other similar observants it differs mainly in the fact Plants Grown in Soil from Landing Site that the object had a peculiar number of legs for landing, and in the shape of the imprints these legs made in the ground. Another peculiarity appears to be the glittering particles of dust. Although we expected much from the analysis of this dust, it proved to be a common mica: A very interesting feature also is the \"dross\" which was not found by us, but by the investigators at the Jozef Stefan Institute. Since standard drosses contain a lot of calcium, this specimen of it was quite different from others in that it contained only the smallest quantity of it. Yet the chemical composition of this dross was more or less a normal one. We cannot be sure how this dross came to the spot: perhaps it already was there before the landing or perhaps it resulted from the presence of the UFO and its still unknown influences upon the ground where it landed. : In any ,case, we investigated a very unusual phenomenon, or better an aircraft the origin and purposes of which we do not know. Additional information: Only a few kilometers from the landing site are several thermocentrals, which are the most powerful objects for electrical production in this part of the country .and also Slovenija. Only a few meters from the landing site are . normal electrical wires. During my second visit in early July, 1977, I learned, after talking with almost all neighbors, that the main eyewitness is reliable and not a publicity seeker or liar. I must say that the case sounds very authentic to me. I also got some new sighting reports dating back to Autumn 1976 and the latest from May, 1977. Those cases are not so spectacular as the landing itself, but they will be investigated further. Finally, I must thank the following members of our small group for their support in our investigation: Marko Breskvar, Franci Bricelj, Damir Cicek, and Branko Kristan. 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"STRANGE MARKINGS IN ALBERTA By John Brent Musgrave (MUFON Provincial Director for Alberta, Canada) Ted Phillip's trace catalogue was published in July, 1975 by the Center for UFO Studies. When taken in proper perspective, it is a useful source book for understanding some kinds of UFO events. But it has to be kept in mind that it is a source book of possible UFO ! events, not a listing of verified UFO I events. The Canadian entries, like those of other countries, vary I considerably in their reliability and usefulness. Some are classic cases, and have been well documented; others are most likely spurious. Unfortunately, many of the entries are in fact no more than unusual burnt areas, or strange markings, for which no everyday explanation could be offered. A mechanical interpretation would have excluded at least a third of the Canadian entries from a catalogue of physical traces actually associated with a UFO sighting-where the association is more than just potential coincidence. Too often physical traces are presumed to have been \"caused\" by a UFO merely because someone, sometime (be it hours, days, weeks, or even months, before the physical trace discovery), somewhere \"nearby\" saw something in the sky. On the other hand, the inclusion of these kinds of f cases can be justified on the theory that if at least some UFO events occur without witnesses (and a great deal of UFO speculation is predicated on this assumption without really considering what this means and in what kinds of cases it probably is not true), then some, if not most, unusual markings are in fact generated by UFOs-whatever UFOs may ultimately turn out to be. It is in this spirit that the following report is presented. The latest strange markings in Alberta were discovered on June 21st, approximately four miles southeast of Lanaria, Alberta (54°13' N., 114°03' W.) as a farmer sprayed his recently planted barley field. Approximately 150 yards from the nearest road, he came upon three dug up trenches in a Y-shape pattern. The three 'legs\" or trenches radiate from a central point, and all dip below the surface at about a 5° slope-so that they become tunnels at the ends. Each leg is about 2-4 inches in diameter, varying unevenly in size along its length. Each leg- curves slightly, rather than being absolutely straight, and each leg is the same length- approximately 56 inches from the center to the end. From above, the base of the Y is pointed 5° south of east, and the arms of the Y are at a 90°angle to each other. The soil around each leg was honeycombed. A hole approximately four inches in diameter and 18 inches deep is located just to the northeast of center. When I visited the site a week and a half after its discovery, the barley plants close to the site were yellowed and brown. Some had speculated that this was caused by the heat of whatever had been there. But the plants were not yellowed when first discovered on the 21st, and likely had been uprooted by the event or subsequent sightseers. By the time I visited the site, it showed the normal effects of being a local point of interest even though a tarp had been placed over it for protection. As soon as it was discovered, the local Royal Canadian Mounted Police were notified and they inspected the site. They informed the owner that \"they would notify someone at the university\". A month after the event, someone from academia has yet to show up. No one in the area can conceive what caused the markings. They are different from anything seen before, and to the knowledge of the local residents no survey crews or anything like that have been in the area. The site is not remote, but it is out of the way. Any vehicle would have left tracks, as there had been frequent rains before the discovery. On Saturday, the 18th of June-three days before the markings were discovered-\"a shiny object\" was observed in the field at about that location by someone driving by on the nearby roadway, but he paid it no attention. Other than this possible connection, there have been no UFO sightings in the area in recent months.

Dr. Scott lives in South Pasadena, California. SYNTHETIC ABDUCTION: A NEW TOOL FOR UFOLOGY There has appeared recently a most provocative and, I believe, a most important piece of experimental research into the nature of the UFO abduction experience. This is the work of William C. McCall, Alvin H. Lawson, and John DeHerrera who have studied the induction of purely imaginary UFO experiences in experimental subjects, by. means of hypnosis. • The results of these experiments are provocative because they challenge the commonly held interpretations of the abductee accounts and will be taken by many as a direct challenge to the credibility of some well known cases such as that of Betty and Barney Hill. These studies are important because they bring into focus what I believe may be two conflicting components of the ufological data: the participatory abduction narrative and the report in which, a description of physical effects forms the primary content. My purpose here is to expand upon this latter concept in view of these new experiments. This note, then, constitutes a reply -to the paper presented by Professor Lawson to the 1977 MUFON Symposium, and which appears in the proceedings of that meeting, (i) These experiments provide a set of results which should be dealt with. Discriminating students of the subject certainly cannot proceed until, to their satisfaction, these findings have been rationalized within the framework of current thought. In the Fall of 1976 Dr. Alvin Lawson, Professor of English, at the California State University, Long Beach, Dr. William McCall, a physician and Mr. John DeHerrera, a UFO researcher 10 associated with APRO, came together to study some alleged UFO abductions. These cases, which were originally identified by Mr. DeHerrera, proved to be unsatisfactory to the researchers on a number of accounts. In a recent conversation, Dr. McCall related that he and his co-workers were struck by the singularly shallow character of the abduction narratives obtained through hypnotic regression. Having employed hypnosis in his practice for nearly 20 years, Dr. McCall, a recognized authority in clinical hypnosis, sensed that the performance of the UFO abductee, as a reporter under hypnosis, suffered in some substantial respect by comparison with patients usually encountered in a clinical context. Induced Abductions The investigators decided that in order to gain some perspective on the abduction experience, it would be useful to plan and carry out hypnotic sessions with naive (of the UFO literature) subjects and, by hypnotic suggestion, place the subjects in an abduction scenario. The descriptive narrative then produced would be entirely the product of the subject's imagination and it was hoped that revealing comparisons with the \"real\" abductees could be drawn. Altogether, eight imaginary abductees have been studied. (2) These were persons carefully screened as to their unfamiliarity with the UFO literature and the absence of previous sightings. The hypnotic sessions were conducted in a hospital in Anaheim, California, by Dr. McCall. Prof. Lawson and Mr. DeHerrera were present. A rigid protocol was employed in which the hypnotist would suggest to the subject that he was in, each of a succession of situations characteristic of a typical UFO abduction. At each stage the subject was asked to describe what. he saw, his surroundings, the occupants, etc. Aside from initial suggestions to relax the subject, the sequence was as follows: A. Loss of control B. Witness senses UFO C. Witness senses being taken - aboard UFO D. Witness senses UFO interior ; E. Witness senses UFO entities F. Witness senses being \"examined\" G. Witness senses being given a \"message\" . H. Witness senses being returned to normal physical/mental environment For example, once the trance was established, Dr. McCall would suggest that the subject would 'look up and see\" an unidentified flying object. The subject was then simply asked to describe what he saw. The subject's own imagination invariably supplied surprising detail. Again, in phase B, \"you are now inside that UFO, describe the interior\". In this manner an imaginary UFO abduction experience was synthesized. It must be emphasized that no more suggestion than that required to \"set the stage\" was given and invariably the subject's own imagination produced a wealth of detailed description, much to the surprise of the investigators. What then were the results of the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"experiments? The raw data of these experiments are the tape 'recordings of the subject's description of his imagined UFO experience. From these tapes, transcripts were prepared by Prof. Lawson who then attempted a comparative analysis between the imaginary and the \"real\" abductee's narratives. Through a painstaking, line by line reduction of the transcripts, Prof. Lawson has tabulated and categorized those \"bits\" of imaginary invention which form the palpable content of these narratives. Similar analyses were carried out on transcripts of \"real\" abductee regressions and a rudimentary statistical comparison was made. Upon examining the tabulations one is immediately impressed by the parallels which exist between imaginary abductees, \"real\" abductees and the literature in general. I believe that the simplest inference which the data support may be summarized in the following statement: Experimental subjects, operating solely on imagination, produce narratives which closely parallel, in detail, those narratives obtained by the hypnotic regression of allegedly real UFO abductees. This has been only a brief sketch of the experimental procedure and the reader is strongly urged to examine Prof. Lawson's papers where his own interpretations, and many facets of the study hot mentioned here, are treated in detail. I have not yet encountered any criticisms of the work which would alter my views regarding the basic inference noted above. In the limited exposure that Prof: Lawson's analysis has had so far, I have heard a number of responses which are surprising. The most surprising, due to it's irrelevant nature, is the statement, \"yes, but they asked leading questions....\". This is precisely the point of the study, to attempt to recreate an abduction narrative as obtained through regression, by a UFO investigator. One can draw upon the transcripts of any regression of an allegedly real abductee and find the questions are leading; more so in most cases than those in Dr. McCall's protocol. As Professor Lawson points out in his talks and articles, there are differences between the \"real\" and imaginary abductees. These differences include the absence of emotional involvement in the imaginary cases as well as the absence of an emotional aftermath. It is hot clear at this point whether these differences are significant to the major findings of the study or to its potential utility. For example, one might ask: what is the difference in principle between a fabrication, born of an emotional disturbance, and an event imagined at the suggestion of a hypnotist to a previously uninvolved subject? It seems consistent that the differences would include those noted. What Does it Mean? We come now to the sticky part. What can it all mean? One implication is clear enough; that information obtained through hypnotic regression of abductees may be highly unreliable. I do not mean to imply that no abductions have occurred, but only that the weight of the new evidence requires that we question the credibility of the UFO abduction as a real experience.- Professor Lawson recognizes this only too well. He writes: \"This study has provided evidence that imaginary subjects under hypnosis report UFO experiences which seem identical to those of 'real' witnesses. However, my assumption - and it is a major one - is that abductions are 'real' in some sense to the witness, and so the central question.:, is this: what is the nature of the stimulus which triggers in witnesses the sequence of events which they describe as an abduction experience? We cannot answer this question, and it may be simplistic to adopt either a 'nuts-and-bolts' or 'psychic' hypothesis.\" This is a meaty paragraph. I think, however, that Professor Lawson may have overlooked a potentially deeper implication for ufology which lies in his own work. The nature of the stimulus which triggers the sequence of events which the witness describes as an abduction, is certainly an important question, but only half of the question. The central question, I believe, is instead: what is the nature of the dichotomy which exists in the body of ufological data and which forces us to consider the possibility of a \"nuts-and- bolts\" or a \"psychic\" hypothesis, in the first place? Indeed, Professor Lawson recognizes that his own work, taken at face value, conflicts with that body of data in which physical effects are reported. He writes: \"Because the research indicates that the imagination of individual witnesses may be the source of much if not all the data we have about alleged abductions, I feel that these experiments represent a significant challenge to the 'nuts-and- bolts' interpretation of the UFO mystery. But the obvious problem with any non-physical hypothesis is that it falls short of explaining physical 'evidence'...\" Professor Lawson goes on to suggest the possibility of an \"unconscious- psychokinetic link\", i.e., the physical effects noted so often in the literature (disturbed soil, photographs, radar returns and the like) are the products of the minds of human beings. This is tidy in that it completely internalizes the entire UFO phenomenon into the psyche of man.  . . Intellectually, I must recoil at this point and for a number of reasons. Firstly, objective examination of the existing literature on paranormal research and its history reveals nothing in the way of a paranormal facility which survives the process of independent replication. This is a fact which must be kept separate from one's own predilections on the matter. Furthermore, the history of the subject is littered with the remains of studies later shown to be faked. This is not to say that paranormal processes do hot exist, but only that existing data are far from convincing. Thus it is certainly premature to adopt (or even speculate (Continued on page 12) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(Continued from page 11) about) paranormal sources for the physical effects so often found in the \"non-participatory\" UFO report. It is much healthier, I think to adopt the point of view that it is the conflict between these two components of the ufological data which should be the appropriate focus of attention - \"the central question\" - in UFO research. This is the message contained in the experiments of McCall, Lawson and DeHerrera. The abductee, and this is only a visceral feeling I voice here, represents something which may in some subtle but significant way, differ from the phenomenon associated with the report of a physical effects sighting or of a CE-1 or CE-II. What is this difference? I don't known, but the hints are there. For example, if we exclude the so-called contactees, the abductee is a late- comer in modern UFO chronicles. We have, since 1947, actually witnessed the emergence of the abduction case, its refinement and finally its cautious acceptance. There are other hints, too. Lawson even touches upon this difference when he asks, \"Why aren't there more interrupted abductions?\" \"Of the hundred-odd UFO abductions reported, none has been a half-way affair. Each has a wholeness or integral quality... which differs from other close encounters. Many witnesses have reported, for instance, that a CE-I or a CE-H was in progress when an approaching vehicle or other interruption apparently caused the UFO to leave... but no partial abductions have been reported and I think this is very curious.\" Significant areas of future research, one should think, lie in identifying the further differences between alleged UFO abductions, physical effects reports and other close encounters. Implications for UFO research are in the areas of methodology and philosophical orientation. One potentially useful device might be a new division of labor in ufology. By analogy with the field of anthropology, where the subject is divided into physical 12 Report from Sweden By Bertil Soderquist, MUFON Representative anthropology and cultural anthro- pology, we might do well to organize our work into areas which could be labelled physical ufology and psychognostic ufology. The physical ufologist would deal with the collection and analysis of all non-participatory UFO reports, i.e., everything from NL through CE-III where no abduction or interaction with occupants is reported. The physical ufologist would attempt to establish the physical reality of the stimulus of these reports. The psychognostic ufologist, on the other hand, would deal with the participatory UFO report and attempt to establish, perhaps through experiments like the ones discussed here, the degree to which the UFO experience is an internal process, independent of physical reality. .The unifying theme in such a scheme is of course to identify as many internal inconsistencies as possible in the-data base and thereby expose new lines of research. Unfortunately, despite 30 years of effort by dedicated people, little advance has been made in understanding the stimulus. But, perhaps we have here, in these experiments, a lead. It is important to bear in mind that we are dealing with what is certainly a human experience, but which carries only a suggestion of physical reality.

Two of the more unusual and interesting cases are summarized here.) Junosuando, northern Sweden; November 16, 1976, 7:30 P.M.-Olle Rostmark, 35, was driving along a country logging road south of Tornefors when he collided with a brilliantly lit sphere about 1.5 meters in diameter. The car started to vibrate, and he felt a burning pain (he described it as a sensation as if he were being cut in two pieces). The whole incident took about 30 seconds. No damage could be seen on the car afterwards. Olle felt paralyzed, and the next day he found his vision to be impaired. Upon examining him, a physician suggested that he might have had a case of snow-blindness. The Esrange rocket research station informs us that a Russian research team has been launching giant balloons from the base daily since November 10. These balloons have a diameter of 50 meters, and have been known to be carried by the winds as far as the Ural Mountains. However, I don't think it likely that balloons are the explanation in this case. Kolsva, central Sweden; November 14, 1976, 4:15 P.M.-About 10 people observed a large UFO about one kilometer north of the community. At the same time, similar observations were made on the Isle of Aland (between Sweden and Finland), and near the town of Abo in Finland. Two witnesses, a man and a woman, gave the following description: \"The UFO hovered above the tree-tops. It resembled a tropical helmet, had a diameter of about six meters, and was shining like silver. A yellowish-red light came from the lower portion, and a plume of smoke rose from the upper portion. No windows could be seen."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Captain Gustavo Fcrreira, a senior pilot for the Colombian airline, Avianca, told of his three UFO sightings in the August 23 issue of National Enquirer.

In the August 30 issue, (Sweden, continued) The UFO disappeared from sight, but a similar object was seen shortly afterwards hovering above the power plant. This latter UFO was subsequently studied for about an hour as it moved upwards, downwards, and made turns. Three times it beamed light rays towards a wooded area below it. Then a smaller UFO appeared. It rose slowly for 20 minutes, positioning itself temporarily beneath the larger UFO- Then it disappeared quickly (out of sight in about 30, seconds). It was described as elongated, resembling a sausage. The central portion was white, and the ends were orange, blue, and red. The larger UFO remained in sight for another half-hour.\" At the same time, 4:15 P.M., two other persons were approaching Kolsva from the north and saw a UFO which they described as being as large as a full moon. A farmer about 10 kilometers away also saw it, as did a number, -of other witnesses from different viewing positions. The local Air Force station has no explanation of the - observation. About .4 P.M., two people on the Isje of Aland, about 250 km. east-northeast of Kolsva, observed a large white light proceeding with great speed in a northwesterly direction. The UFO resembled a teaspoon in shape. The observation lasted one-half hour, during which the UFO changed altitude several times. About the same time, in the vicinity of Abo, Finland, 120 km. further to the east-northeast, two people observed a UFO with a long, brilliant tail of light towards the west. They later saw the UFO disappear towards Aland. Lucius Farrish In Others'Words Ted Phillips summarizes his investigations of lending sites, as well as commenting on UFO activity in general.

The trend towards sensationalism and fiction is evident in the October issue of Official UFO. This issue has a few redeeming features, in the form of George Barley's book review column [since cancelled. - Ed], article by Dorothy Aldridge, etc., but it is evident that these are holdovers from Dennis Hauck's tenure as editor.

And if you think Official UFO is bad, wait until you see the November issue of Ancient Astronauts! The less said about it, the better. Save your money! D. Scott Rogo's The Haunted Universe is another attempt to explain UFOs (and other types of anomalous phenomena) .in terms of psychic manifestations. Of course, Rogo does talk of UFOs and \"monsters\" being \"physical realities,\" but he thinks that humans are creating even more of these enigmas in their minds. Says he, \"For every UFO that flits through the sky, many more are created by the psyche\". Now what about those \"real\" UFOs? What are they? Rogo doesn't like the idea of extraterrestrial vehicles because, he says, \"no one has ever .downed one, shot off a part of one, or captured -one on the ground\". Personally, I wouldn't make any bets on either of those possibilities. If the idea of UFO events as personal \"psycho-dramas\" interests you, you might very well like the Rogo book. However, I prefer that writers display a great deal more familiarity with their subjects, not to mention double-checking their data to eliminate obvious boo-boos. As a writer on parapsychology,, Rogo may be able to hold his own with the best of them, but when it comes to UFOs and Forteana, he still has a lot to learn.

They consist in the main of lights in the sky - either individual lights, or lights in formation. On the other hand, there has been at least one account of a \"possible abduction\" near Prince George, B.C. (1) on the 5th of January, as well as a combined physical trace and occupant report from Montreal, P.Q. the very next day. (2) But the majority of cases are only lights in the sky. Venus and Jupiter were both brilliant earlier in the year, and at least the majority of sightings in one \"UFO mini-flap\" — that at Slave Lake, Alberta — were caused by misidentifications of these two planets. (3) The Slave Lake sightings received national coverage-in part due to the promotional activity of Major Wayne Aho, a contactee who visited the area as part of a toiir through this part of Canada. (4) There appears to have been a pattern to at least some of the lights in the sky reports, and they may tie-in with some of the closer Canadian sightings. A significant number of sightings involve one or more bright red lights — some flashing or pulsating, others steady in brightness. Among the published reports are the following. Early in January three Ontario Provincial Police officers of the Napanee detachment observed a brightly-lit UFO hovering over the Lennox hydro generating station at about 2:30 A.M. A large bright red light is reported to have \"swooped down low\" over the village, and then streaked upward. (5) Later in the month, on the 21st, at 8:30 P.M. a \"flashing red light\" was seen over West Peters, P.E.I. by four RCMP constables, as well as many of the townsfolk. (6) Another flashing red light was observed at Saint- Barthelemy, P.Q. on February 17th at 9:15 P.M. (7) On the 3rd of March just after 9 P.M. a flashing red light was observed at Hawkesbury, Ontario, by a member of the Ontario Provincial Police and two youths. (8) The flasher has been seen on cither nights over Hawkesbury as well, including the night of May 29th — again, just after 9 P.M. (9) On the 15th of April at 9:20 P.M., several lights were seen in a triangular formation over Beloeil, P.Q.; the report does not specify the color of the lights in the formation. (10) However, the same evening, around 10 P.M. at least Slights were observed over London, Ontario — four of which were reported to have been in an arrow-shaped formation. The lights were also witnessed by at least one pilot, Bruce Powell. He observed them from his twin engine Piper Aztec at about 10:30 P.M., after hearing about them over the radio while he was up in the air. He told a radio interviewer that he wasn't able to get a really good look at them, but that they were flashing red lights — possibly more than one red light on each UFO, and they could have had a conical cylinder shape. He chased them for about half an hour before returning and landing. (11) One of the most interesting Canadian close encounter reports so far this year comes from Victoria, B.C. Around 9 P.M. on March 9th, two teenage sisters, Maria and Susanna Stratford, saw a shiny oval object descend almost to tree-top level. It had a flashing red light on top, a bulge on the bottom, and made a low humming noise. The two sisters said the UFO circled 30 feet above them, and they could see the reflection of street lights on its surface before it took off. (12) Closer to home, Edmonton, Alberta, has had its share of steady and flashing red lights as well, though none of the sightings have been close encounters with structural detail. On the llth of March, several members of the Edmonton UFO Society in different parts of the city observed a brilliant red flashing light from just before 11 P.M. until around 11:30. There was a cloud ceiling of 12,000 feet; yet when observed through binoculars and a telescope, the light could not be resolved. Red flashing lights were also observed over Edmonton in April. Hundreds of people from various parts of the city observed two red flashing lights close together — again between 11 and 11:30 P.M. The lights were close together, and gave the impression of being part of the same object. One witness, Charles R. Elliott, circulation manager for Edmonton Report magazine, described it as \"exactly like the light from a C-47 Puff-The-Magic Dragon gunship.\" That is, it appeared to be two V-shaped tongues of red fire, 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"moving slowly westward. (13) This happened on the 23rd of April. Because of the publicity given these sightings, one witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, came forth with two color photographs he took through a 200mm lens (Canon). While observing the two lights, he got the impression 'that there was a structure between them; but this doesn't show up in the photographs. They were taken at about %-second with Kodak 64ASA slide film. The black and white reproductions do show the change in brightness as the two lights continually flashed. The photographer moved while, taking the second photograph, and the two trails show the comparative change in brightness during this time interval. Sometime during the spring (exact date not remembered by the witness) a disc-shaped red object was observed by a woman as she was driving home early in the evening. She was driving south, and the object was to the west of her car, also travelling south. It appeared to be just above the power lines, and was larger than the moon in apparent size. It was elliptical or oval shaped, and was tilted downward at about a 45° angle. She observed it for perhaps a minute or more before going inside her house to get more witnesses. When they came outside they could see a red light low in the south which soon disappeared. On the 7th of April, a number of school children were playing in a south side school yard about 8:45 P.M. They saw an oval shaped object which had red lights on the top, a row of blue lights in the middle, and then a row of red lights on the bottom. It was observed for perhaps 3-5 minutes — but gave the impression of not being close by. ( REFERENCES 1. APRO Bulletin, March, 1977. 2.

Its potential influence on the U.S. Government was suggested by David Williamson, a NASA assistant for special projects involved with the proposed space agency study of UFOs, who has been quoted as saying, \"Close Encounters is going to kill us.\" He was alluding to the probable effect that the film will have in adding pressure on NASA to do something about UFOs. Despite that welcome prospect, early verbal reports from knowledgable UFO researchers who have seen CE-III are not encouraging with regard to its treatment of factual UFO events. Contrary to the advance publicity, they say, many liberties are taken with \"facts,\" and the events depicted often are embellished beyond the known features of catalogued UFO reports. CE-III was not expected to be a documentary, but it supposedly was to be based closely on real happenings. A poorly informed public may be lead to believe that the events they see on the screen have really happened, and unfortunately that will further confuse the issue of what real, verified evidence exists about UFOs. Apparently CE-III comes closer to being another \"docu-drama,\" and has all the good and bad features of that genre. One of the bad features is the blurring of established truth or reality for the sake of drama and/or to make social commentary. Knowledgable ufologists are likely to be disappointed unless they consider it as a philosophical or poetic statement about the implications of encountering extraterrestrials and about man's place in the scheme of things. Most reviewers to date have seen it that way, and most 16 6 DAYS LEFT . have found it to be a warm, human story with strong religious or mystical overtones. Advance Publicity CE-III has had extraordinary advance publicity. In the Washington area alone it has had at least the following mentions: •Two-page ads in the Washington Post (also in major cities across the U.S.) in April •Mention by reviewer Gary Arnold in the Post (10/17) calling it a \"UFO thriller\" •Article in the Post by Jack Egan (11/2) about stock market speculation in Columbia Pictures stock based on the film's anticipated earnings; Egan called it the \"hottest ticket\" in New York •Story in the Post (11/7) by Tom Zito describing a special screening of CE-DI in New York for 2,500 journalist from all over the world •Story in the Post (11/8) by Gary Arnold about the New York special screening: \"There seemed to be general agreement that...(it is) destined to end up among the top moneymakers of modern film - history. 'Close Encounters' is a more exciting and ingratiating set of variations on the mystical science-fiction theme introduced in'2001'\" •\"Openings\" notice in the Post \"Weekend\" magazine (12/9): \"...extraordinary new science- fiction fantasy.. .suspenseful.. .a finale of dazzling pictorial beauty and transporting sentimental appeal\" A \"count-down\" ad (see above) has also appeared in the Washington Post, and presumably other major cities. Most reviewers, whether or not they liked other aspects of the film, have singled out the spectacular climax as being something extraordinary. Time CLOSE ENCOUNTERS Of TH€ THffm KIND DECEMBER AP IN WASHIMSTOW PcSf (11/7) reviewed it at length. The reviewer says, \"...it reaches the viewer at a far more profound level than \"Star Wars\" ...it uses science fiction thrills to seduce the audience into looking at the cosmos metaphysically...The moment (of climax) has a powerful, almost mystical, emotional charge...\" Newsweek (11/21) devoted a cover story to it, with a detailed review and three \"sidebar\" stories about Dr. Hynek, Director Steven Spielberg, and special effects wizard Douglas Trumbull. Reviewer Jack Kroll terms it \"a genuine work of the popular imagination.\" As he sees it, \"...it's not about the paranormal, it's about people.\" In addition, it is \"first and foremost...an entertainment movie...(a) popular SF (science fiction) romance...\" In New Yorker magazine (11/28), a well-known reviewer Pauline Kael waxed rhapsodic about this \"beautiful, big, enjoyable film.\" She saw it as one of the most \"innocent technological marvel movies and one of the most satisfying.\" To her, the machines from outer space were \"defied,\" and represented a \"beatific technology.\" It was a young man's film of \"immense charm\" and \"not a sour thought in it.\" Overall, she characterized it as \"a scientific fairy tale...a transcendentally sweet movie.\" The spectacular climax, she says, is \"one of the peerless moments in movie history.\" (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"UFO Halts Van in South Africa (Translated from Die Water/and, June 23, 1977, by Cynthia Hind) For the first time in the history of UFQs in South Africa, a UFO has brought a vehicle to a standstill. Mr. Arthur Knott-Craig, editor of the Karroo News has confirmed to us that last week, one of the newspaper's delivery vans was compulsorily brought to a standstill by a UFO. UFOs have made people scatter in the district of Graaf-Reniet, Hanover and De Aar. This time, the UFOs appeared only at night. Whether it was one or more, -no one can say. (Continued from page 16) Equally, impressed was reviewer Vern Perry in the Santa Ana, Calif., Register (11/18). Perry termed it \"...an unqualified, artistic success...nothing short of one of the most awesome displays of cinematic ingenuity ever to come out of Hollywood.\" What It Means for UFOlogy Altogether, these advance notices suggest that CE-ffl has not really done justice to UFQs per se. Instead; it is a slick entertainment package somewhere : between dpcu- drama and fantasy — a personal vision of the Director only piggybacking on reported UFO cases to allow him the raw material for a visual spectacular and — according to some — a vehicle for social commentary. Spielberg himself has been, quoted as preferring to call it an \"adventure thriller.\" It would appear that whatever effects the film has on real-life UFO investigations, therefore, are likely to be a result of stirring the popular imagination rather than convincingly portraying real UFO events in a fictional setting. Additional reviews, comments, and impressions of CE-FII will be included in future issues of the Journal. V the film succeeds in waking people to the import of possible contact .with extraterrestrials or \"metaterrestrials\" its influence on UFO investigations could be profound. In one instance, a UFO hovered alongside the National Road, not far from Hanover. The UFO followed a farmer's car. The farmer later reached 200km/h in an effort to lose the UFO, but it remained on his tail and its strong lights lit up the interior of the car. Another farmer had a similar experience. But the incident in which Mr. At Gouws of Noupoort was involved, was the highlight of all the experiences. It was 5:15 AM when Mr. Gouws was on his way to Lootsberg, where he had to meet Mr. Knott-Craig with all the news from the North for Saturday's paper. When Mr. Gouws reached Mr. Knott-Craig, he was shaking like a leaf with fright. He said that near the Farm Ebenhaeser on the National Road between Noupoort and Middelburg, he became aware of a dull glow at. the Wolwekop. quarry. For a moment he thought it was the moon and did not pay any further attention to it. But suddenly, the UFO, with its phosphorescent-like glow, plummeted down onto the newspaper's vehicle. The glow from the UFO enveloped the whole vehicle. Although Mr. Gouws did not stop, the,vehicle's engine cut out and the lights died. A moment later, the UFO left with a buzzing sound and the vehicle's engine and lights came on of their own accord. Mr. Gouws says he can remember everything as he tells it, but nothing further. He cannot recall what happened while, he was in the vehicle and the UFO hung in front, next to and above him, and gave off the glow. \"I felt that something happened, but cannot think what,\" he said. \"\\ really had a terrible fright.\" Immediately after the engine of his vehicle started of its own accord, it died again. When he pressed the starter, the engine took hold again then proceeded normally. Mr. Gouws handed in a report about his experience to the Middelburg Police.

Stringfield Doubleday 7 Company, S8.95 \"Either man is alone in the gal- axy, or he is not; either alternative is mind-boggling.\" Lee DuBridge, the eminent physicist, has stated the conundrum well. In our .own corner of the galaxy relatively close as astronomical distances go, astrophysicists con- servatively estimate that there are probably .at least a million stars with planets supporting highly- evolved life forms. Others think the number might be ten times this high! Astronomer Frank Drake of Cornell University puts it, \"At this very minute, with almost ab- solute certainty, radio waves sent forth by other intelligent civili- zations are falling on the earth.'' • Evidently more than radio waves may be falling on the earth these days, according to Len Stringfield's new book. \"An Update on Strange and Frequently Frightening Encounters,\" as the book is sub- titled, describes it rather well. You may have noticed the announce- ment of the book in the Sunday Enquirer for May 22, Len, as you may know, is a Cincinnatian, a seasoned vetern of 27 years of UFO investigation with an international reputation for careful and unbiased repotting. He has invited C.R.A. members to assist in tracking and reporting local UFO incidents. Len's approach to the subject is far from sensationalistic, despite the title of the book. He does, however, convey a sense of urgency to our search for the truth about UFO's; with good reason, you'll agree, when you've read this fas- cinating book. If you're curious about the nature of the \"unsettling disclosures\" about UFO's expected to be released by the government later this year according to U.S. News and World Report, you'll find the answers here. Whether you are a seasoned saucer buff or - only mildly interested in UFO's Len's book will serve you well. The \"foo fighters'' of World War II serve to introduce a historical panorama which provides a back- ground for the current situation. Len's own UFO experience in 1945 is detailed as well. As a member of an Air Force Intelligence mission to Japan, a few days before the actual surrender, he saw three UFO's pace their plane at close range. Electromagnetic effects and loss of power almost necessitated ditching at sea. This antedates by two years Ken Arnold's famous \"flying saucers over Mount . Rainier\" which ushered in the ear of popular interest in the phe- nomena. From lights in the sky to landings from close encounters to abductions Len leads the reader through a maze of doumented cases, several of which have not been publicized before. Close encounters are oc- curring with increasing frequency, and in such numbers that the lid of secrecy simply can't be kept on any longer. \"Situation Red\" gives us a peek behind the scenes of history in the making as govern- ments around the world prepare to tell their citizens the truth. I was fooled by the size of Len's book. It doesn't look very thick and $8.95 is a lot of transistors, but it's 'size is deceptive. :There's,a.lot:of reading there, and a lot of fine photographs. To keep the cost down narrow margins were used, so in terms of material contained the book is quite a bargain. It's one you'll be proud to have in your library, and may be in big demand by the end of the year.

Some of the speakers who ' presented papers were Dr. L. Gerrera, Dr. H. Th. Auerback, Adolph Schneider, Charles Huffer, E. Gerland, and lib Brand. Having published their three prior conference proceedings in German, they will soon publish the 1977 MUFON—CES Proceedings in English only. It will include the governmental inquiry made in the United States by Charles Huffer, short conference , reports and field investigation reports of UFO cases in Langenargen/ Bodensee and Jemgun/Ostfriesland (North Germany). At the conference, Charles Huffer gave an illustrated slide report on the First International UFO Congress in Acapulco,.Mexico, and the Eighth Annual MUFON UFO Symposium in Scottsdale, Arizona, on July 16 and 17. Charles A. Huffer has agreed to , serve as the liaison representative of MUFON to the MUFON/CES. Charles, a U.S. citizen, teaches V mathematics at Berlin High School in Berlin, Germany. His mailing address is Berlin High School, APO, NY 09742. He considers Little Rock, Arkansas, as his home in the United States. It has been a distinct pleasure knowing and working with Charles during the past two years. He is a member of MENSA. The international scope of MUFON is very apparent when one notes the number of UFO reports published in the Journal each month. The May, 1977 issue carried articles by Augustin Moraru - Romania, Jenny Randies-England, Ilkka Serra-Finland, and Mike Viljoen - South Africa. The June 1977 issue carried a pilot report in Columbia written by Don Berliner. The July issue featured a UFO sighting report by Milos Krmelj from Yugoslavia, \"Encounter at Sea\" in Spain by Maximiliano del Rosal as translated by Ricardo Aguilar, \"UFOs Collide Over Brazil\" by Otto Raymundo, \"UFOs Over the Waldviertel Highlands\" by Ernst Berger - Austria, and \"Little Balls and UFOs\" by Jean Bastide - France. MUFON is not only indebted to these fine people for their international UFO sighting reports, but to Richard H. Hall, International Coordinator and to Joe Brill from Quincy, Illinois, former coordinator for developing our worldwide network. While recognizing the contri- butions of MUFON's foreign representatives, we would like to thank Bryan M. Hartley, 23 Hastings Road, Thomton-le-Fylde, Lancashire, FY5 5JA, England, for sending us the current issues of Northern UFO News, a mimeographed publication by the Northern UFO Network in England, edited by Jenny Randies. The ink had hardly dried on the 1977 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings before we started planning for our Ninth Annual MUFON UFO Symposium to be held July 29 and 30, 1978, at the Dayton Convention Center in Dayton, Ohio, with room accomodations at Stouffer's Dayton Plaza Hotel and Dayton Downtown Holiday Inn. Richard Hoffman is scheduled to be the master of ceremonies. Speakers who have already consented to speak are Major Donald E. Keyhoe, Raymond Fowler, Ted Bloecher, and Richard H. Hall. Plan your vacations to not only attend the symposium, but to visit the former site of Project Blue Book at Wright- Patterson AFB. It is with regret that we accept the resignation of Dennis W. Hauck as Editor of MUFON UFO Journal. He has been unable to devote his full attention to this important contribution to UFOlogy during the past few months. We still are not back on schedule with our current issues of the Journal. As a means of \"catching up\", Dennis will edit the August issue, Richard Hall the September issue, and Walt Andrus the October, 1977 issue, each working independently, but simultaneously. In the meantime, a new editor will be secured. Our best wishes are extended to Dennis in his future publishing endeavors. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

UFO and the Media The deterioration of the newsstand magazine Official UFO into a sensationalistic fiction-monger is only one sign of a long-standing problem. The recent and pending UFO movies ~ mostly fictionalized or so-called \"docu- drama\" ~ are another part of it. The problem is the exploitation of the UFO subject by the popular media. Worse than that, the cheapening of the subject which prevents it being taken seriously at higher levels. Recent personal experience with these organizations has led me to the bitter conclusion that their efforts tend to be incompatible with, and often greatly harmful to, serious UFO research. Their presence is nothing new, but their influence today perhaps is more insidious. In the 1960*s at NICAP I was approached by \"men's magazines,\" fly-by-night film companies, and the National Enquirer, (whose trademark then was bloody violence and sex), all wanting to exploit UFOs. They had to be, and were, rebuffed. Today the National Enquirer has cleaned up its image considerably. Although its reliability and accuracy in some areas still is subject to considerable doubt, certain of its reporters are doing a good job with UFO news. Even so, the news is presented within a fabric of insipid, romantic mush, tattle-tale gossip about stars, and advice on how to solve all your problems. Today MUFON and other groups maintain uneasy relationships with the National Enquirer, flashy newsstand magazines on UFOs (unheard of in the 1960*s), and the film companies, all eager to exploit the popular interest in UFOs. As the only media groups paying attention to us, they stroke our egos, pay for our information, and flatter us by their attention. But what are they doing to us in the long run? Are we not being prostituted? A shoddy version of the \"truth\" is being mass-marketed purely to make money, further misleading an already poorly informed public. Just as con men rush in to fill the vacuum left by scientists who take a hands-off attitude, so do the least responsible journalists seize on a popular subject when higher class media organizations turn up their noses. It should be no surprise in these circumstances that UFOs have the image of being a puffed-up, insubstantial subject propagated by opportunists. I feel that we must seriously question the nature of any future relationships with those who contribute so greatly to the confusion and misinformation about UFO. Perhaps more effort should be given to a campaign of presenting carefully investigated facts to high quality journalists, scientists, and others whose involvement could make a difference. I Mark R.
