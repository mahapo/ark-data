FROM THE EDITOR As I write, both Intruders and Communion have just appeared in paperback, the latter display accompanied by a free pin-on button portraying the by now familiar alien face below the slogan \"We Are Here.\" Even without give-away gimmicks, ufology's most recent year was dominated by the UFO abduction, public interest in which clearly eclipsed the fortieth anniversary of Kenneth Arnold's landmark sighting as well as the MJ-12 papers, presently suspended somewhere between proof and poof. Accordingly, we've devoted an entire issue to the subject while managing to squeeze in our regular departments and a backlog of correspondence we needed to take care of. We wish a prosperous and productive New Year to both the Journal readers and our members. As a preview, the March issue of the Journal will feature a photograph of a possible UFO taken from a weather satellite, the Gulf Breeze, Florida photographs and the very significant UFO sighting in Australia that occurred on January 18, 1988.

Bullard Dr. Bullard holds a doctorate in folklore from Indiana University, where he wrote his dissertation on UFOs. The following contributed paper, summarizing a study carried out for the Fund for UFO Research, was presented at the Washington Symposium. A longer summary is available from the Fund. The most remarkable thing about UFO abductions is that they happen at all. The second most remarkable thing about them is that they happen so often. If the Barney and Betty Hill case had remained unique it would stand isolated as a mere curiosity, a freak with little bearing on the UFO mystery as a whole. Instead hundreds of other cases have surfaced and forced the conclusion that abductions are actually common, though never commonplace. Next to the inherent strangeness of the reports, their major attraction is the amount of information they contain. One abduction reveals more about UFOs than a thousand lights in the night. In quality and quantity abductions best fulfill the meaning of J. Allen Hynek's phrase, \"an embarrassment of riches.\" Most abduction research has concentrated on in-depth investiga- tions of individual cases. Thanks to the diligence of Jerome Clark, Ann Druffel, Raymond Fowler, Budd Hopkins, Leo Sprinkle and others, the results of these investigations are some supurbly detailed reports. With so many reports now on hand, a study in breadth rather than depth offers a chance to look beyond cases in particular and draw meaningful conclusions about the abduction phenomenon in general. The Fund for UFO Research has sponsored a project with this goal in mind. The first step was to catalogue reports from printed sources, mostly from book-length treatments and articles from leading UFO periodicals. In this way I gathered about 300 cases, and over 200 of them are \"true\" abductions, where a witness is captured and temporarily detained by apparently alien beings aboard an extraordinary flying machine for purposes of a medical examination of some kind. The second step calls for a comparative analysis of these cases: Line them up and see where they are alike or where they differ, and the findings will tell how consistent the abduction phenomenon really is. No one familiar with abductions will be surprised to hear that the consistencies are many, but few have guessed just how consistent abductions prove to be. An outline of the results now follows. Elements unusual enough to be distinctive while recurring from case to case qualify as significant constants of the abduction phenomeon. CONSISTENCIES OF FORM A striking but seldom-noticed characteristic of abduction reports is the sequence of events that unfolds. The abduction story consists of a maximum of eight episodes — capture, examination, conference, tour, otherworldy journey, theophany, return, and aftermath. Not every case contains every episode, and some episodes are quite rare; but those that do appear follow this prescribed sequence with remarkable fidelity. Out of 193 cases with two or more episodes, 163 show the \"correct\" order. Exacting arrangements order the event of some episodes as well as the overall story. Capture consists of four distinctive parts — intrusion, where a UFO appears and stalks the witness; zone of strangeness, where odd things happen to the physical world; time lapse, when the witness suffers some form of mental impairment; and procurement, when the beings take the witness into custody. When two or more of these parts occur in a report, they follow this order in 77% of the cases. Procurement has the complexity of a sub-episode unto itself, with a sequence of eight recurrent events: A beam of light may strike the witness, a force may draw him, beings appear, and a conversation follow. The beings may pacify or otherwise control the witness, then escort him to the ship and float him on board. He enters with a momentary loss of memory, or doorway amnesia. Again 77% of the cases with two or more of these events arrange them in the prescribed sequence. The examination episode breaks down into eight distinct activities: The beings prepare the witness by undressing, cleansing and positioning him on a table. Then the- actual examination moves from general to more specific concerns as the beings first subject the witness to a manual exploration, apparently to gauge gross external characteristics. A scanning device.like an eye or light next passes over the witness, followed by instrumental investigations aimed perhaps at internal structure and physiological functions. The beings then take specimens of skin, hair or body fluids, and an examination of the reproductive areas comes next. At the close of the examination the beings show interest in the neurological system, often by implanting a tiny device into the brain or spine of the witness. A behavioral test may complete the process, perhaps to check performance after the insert is made. A total of 69% of the cases follow this pattern. The return episode begins with a farewell, and thereafter reverses capture. The witness exits and experiences doorway amnesia once again as the beings float him outside. After watching the departure of the 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"craft, the witness reenters the normal world as he resumes his previous activities and memories of the abduction fade away. The four parts of this episode stay true to form in two thirds of the cases. What matters about the order of these events is that the pattern is not inevitable. A conference could precede the examination or specimen taking the scan, and the change would make no difference to the story. It would still make sense one way or the other. The fact that witness after witness sticks to one arbitrary order suggests that the experience itself is structured that way. THE INNER EPISODES Less common than the episodes discussed above, the inner episodes lack a fixed internal order as well. The commonest sequel to the examination is a conference, a more or less formal period of conversation between the witness and his captors. Four topics raised in no particular sequence characterize the conference: The beings may interrogate the witness about topics of interest to them. Explanations of where the beings come from and why they are here are common. They may make a request of the witness, often to forget the experience but sometimes to learn or improve himself, or bring them information at a future date. Warnings that certain human behaviors are dangerous and prophecies of coming events are also common. The prophecies usually predict coming disasters and even apocalyptic changes on earth, events the aliens or an enlightened witness may mitigate. A few cases include a tour of the ship, apparently as a courtesy to the witness. This tour may include a glimpse of the engine room, where several witnesses report crystalline globes attached to a rotor device. Now follows perhaps the most bizarre episode of all, the other-worldly journey. The witness may be placed in an immersion chamber or other protective environment before the trip begins, then almost instantaneously the ship arrives at its destination. Calling this place another planet may be a mistake, because the place often seems 4 underground or under water, associated with caverns and provided with a luminous but sunless sky and an indistinct horizon. The witness often sees a bustling city and ample signs of alien civilization, but barreness typifies the physical environment. Either the landscape is desertlike or devastated, or the sky is dark and the vegetation looks unhealthy. The only fertile scenes appear in subterranean environments. These impressions repeat with almost unchallenged consistency. Rarest among the episodes is the theophany, where the witness encounters a divine being, or sees something the beings appear to regard as sacred. Betty Andreasson's meetings with a presence she interpreted as God are the most familiar examples of this incident. After the witness returns, his abduction experience still may not be over. Its consequences often dog him for weeks and even years. An aftermath of some sort frequently follows an abduction, and while formless, this episode consists of distinctive aftereffects of immediate, intermediate, and long-term onset. The immediate aftereffects are mostly physical in nature and include eye irritation, sunburned skin, gastrointestinal upset and cuts or puncture wounds. Mental effects take over in a week or two as the physical injuries heal. The witness may be troubled by nightmares or anxiety as partial recollection of a strange and upsetting experience creeps back into consciousness. Longer term changes may involve major reorganization of the witness's personality, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. New interests and a desire for learning may grip the witness, extrasensory powers may develop, and he may become a more sensitive, humane person. In other cases the witness may turn from reliable to erratic and his entire personality unravel. Paranormal experiences with Men in Black, apparitional and poltergeist-like phenomena may follow. The commonest aftereffect is further encounters with the aliens. One abduction sometimes leads to another, and a few witnesses report a lifelong history of abductions, UFO sightings and meetings with unusual beings. GRAFT, OCCUPANTS, AND EFFECTS Not all the consistencies in abduction stories are limited to the form and content of the episodes. The craft has a discoidal shape in 136 out of 162 cases. In some cases the disk is thick, in others thin, sometimes a dome or projections differentiate the craft, and sizes vary so much that witnesses compare the ship to anything from a small car to a football field. The craft are clearly not carbon copies, but few cigar or other shapes challenge the general discoidal pattern. Once inside the witness usually finds himself within a circular, domed room without sharp corners. Lighting is uniform and diffused without a specific source visible, the atmosphere is usually cold and clammy and the air difficult to breathe because of its heaviness or, less frequently, its noxiousness. The beings may be human, humanoid or monstrous. Humanoids make up two thirds of the 203 cases where witnesses describe the beings, while humans appear in 52 cases. The standard humanoid is of short to average height, has a large rounded head and enormous, compelling eyes. The nose and ears are small, even vestigial, while the mouth is no more than a hole or slit. No hair grows on the gray, ashen skin, and the beings dress in a tight overall uniform. Some clues to the personality and concerns of the beings emerge in abduction reports as well: Most crews have a leader who converses with the witnesses, using telepathy to address humans but a rapid mumbling verbal speech to communicate with others of his own kind. The beings are polite in speech and behavior, but their courtesy often proves false, a mere front to manipulate the witness and win his cooperation. In fact the beings seem clinical and aloof, indifferent to and perhaps uncomprehending of human pain and fear. One emotion they express is surprise, judging from the excitement they have shown over such discoveries as false teeth and surgical scars. Evasiveness typifies much of the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"beings' treatment of captives. The beings seem to resent a witness watching them and may influence him to keep his eyes averted and closed during the abduction. When the witness questions them the beings may refuse to answer or give out disinformation, absurd replies that satisfy the witness but reveal nothing to him. Then the time lapse effect robs him of even the memory that he was abducted at all. Emotions seem to hold particular interest for the beings. They may question a witness at length about this human characteristic, also'about the individuality and separateness of humans. Time and aging seem like complete mysteries to the beings. Their interest in reproduction comes to the fore during the examination, but other hints reinforce the impression that natters of reproduction and fertility command a central place in the beings' concerns. In conversations the beings may state outright that they have trouble reproducing, desire to reinvigorate their stock by combining with humans, or come from a dying and infertile planet. Observations of the otherworld confirm this admission. A preference for youthful captives is striking in a comparison of the ages of abductees, while the beings rejected one witness as too old and another because of a vasectomy. These choices make sense if interest in fertility motivates them. The samples, tampering with witnesses' genitalia, and scale of the abduction program suggest beings in serious biological trouble exploiting human captives in an effort to survive. A number of strange phenomena associate with abductions, and these events can gather under the rubric of \"effects.\" Some effects apply to the physical world and others to the mind. Physical effects, include a vacuum-like stillness surrounding the abduction site and influences on motor vehicles, some the traditional electromagnetic effects familiar in UFO reports, others a seemingly external control over the operation of a vehicle. The best known mental effect is time lapse, a gap in witness memory during the period of the abduction. This phenomenon occurs in 164 cases, while other forms of mental impairment such as unconsciousness or lethargy boost the total even higher. The witness may behave in uncharacteristic ways while under the beings' influence, and they seem to have a number of mind control techniques by which they pacify the witness, relieve pain, and induce compliance with their wishes. Other effects lie in a shadowland between the physical and mental. The witness floats to the ship, but does he defy gravity or only feel as if he floats? Evidence points both ways. Cases of passing ghostlike through a solid wall and an isolation effect whereby the abduction takes place in an inhabited area in plain view, yet no one else intrudes, raise similar questions. MEANING WHAT? Comparative analysis of abduction reports piles up a mountain of data to reach only a molehill of conclusions. The ultimate nature of abductions eludes this study because its real subject is not the experience itself but the abduction report. All truths found here are truths about texts and not necessarily about the phenomenon responsible for them. This literary Neverland excludes consideration of the witness, his sincerity and emotional involvement, and any physical evidence the experience leaves behind. Similarities in form and content are important to know, but ultimate answers demand exterior evidence to bridge the gap between report and reality. Three explanations may account for the similarities among abduction reports: 1) The reports may be alike because different people share the same kind of objective experience. 2) The reports may be alike because different people share the same kind of subjective experience. This explanation assumes some sort of universal (or transpersonal) psychological phenomenon capable of generating the mental images and feelings of abductions. 3) The reports may be alike because different people share the same story tradition. Narrators then merely repeat the form and contents of stories heard from other narrators, or more plausibly, a well-publicized report influences the perceptions and descriptions of subsequent witnesses so that they distort their own experience to conform to their expectations. A case can be argued for each interpretation with the evidence from this study. If this study cannot settle once and for all what abductions are, the effort proves one thing about them beyond a shadow of a doubt: Abduction reports as a body show far more similarities than accident, random hoaxes or purely fantasies can explain. The consistencies in form and content down to numerous minute details demonstrate that abductions make up a coherent phenomenon, whatever its ultimate nature. Any skeptic who dismisses this unity relies on hope rather than evidence to support his case.

Dr. David Jacobs is a professor of history at Temple University and the author of The UFO Controversy in America. He will also have a book out on abductions this year. INTRODUCTION (The following pages have been prepared by two experienced UFO investigators, Budd Hopkins and Dr. David Jacobs, and two UFO abductees, referred to here by pseudonyms. Both \"Caroline Bowles\" and \"Lucille Forman\" are trained psychotherapists who have undergone regressive hypnosis in the investigation of their own UFO recollections. Their contributions are especially valuable, since they are qualified to discuss these unusual experiences from several different perspectives. Hundreds of people have contacted me in response to TV or radio interviews, to the books Missing Time and Intruders, or to magazine and newspaper articles in The New York Times, Omni, The Philadelphia Inquirer and elsewhere. Many of these people have raised the same issues, asked the same questions, expressed the same uncertainties. This primer is an attempt to provide helpful answers. - -Budd Hopkins, New York, 1987.) I. PERILS & BENEFITS OF EXPLORATION The decision as to whether or not you should investigate the origin of bothersome UFO dreams, memories and experiences is a decision of crucial importance. In fact, it could be the most important decision you will ever make. It represents one of those rare times when a single conscious choice can permanently alter the course of your 6 life. If you learn that you actually have undergone UFO abduction exper- iences, there will be no turning back. Your relationship to friends and relatives, and indeed to the world, will all have changed. The decision to explore such memories must therefore be taken with the utmost seriousness. There are many reasons for deciding against such an exploration. First of all, the timing may be wrong. Severe anxieties brougth about by personal events — a divorce, a death in the family or other emotional upheavals — may provide an unstable background for pursuing this kind of potentially traumatic investigation. Whether or not you see yourself as having \"emotional problems,\" you must nevertheless consider your situation carefully. UFO abduction recollections can be very disturbing to recall and therefore too upsetting, too difficult to handle under such circumstances. Any hidden experiences will always be there, so you can choose to investigate them at a future, safer time. If you do decide to explore your memories you can expect new and sometimes difficult challenges in your life. Any freshly recalled UFO events may prompt new, unexpected revelations — or even a flood of these possibly traumatic recollections. You might begin to think about the future and suddenly wonder if these disturbing events could happen again. Questions about the possible involvement of your family could also arise, and all of this can be quite unsettling. Recalling and accepting the truth of your UFO experiences can alter your relationships with the very people who are closest to you. Though some lucky abductees find that their family and friends completely accept what they have said about their experiences, they are unfortunately in the minority. Talking about your UFO abduction can easily cause even family and friends to question your sanity. After all, these accounts will inevitably seem bizarre. If your loved ones truly care about you their concern with your mental health is an appropriate and even loving reaction. In consequence you must be understanding of their point of view. If you choose to explore your abduction recollections and you discover that they are based on apparently real events, you will undoubtedly gain new insight into years of previous behavior. Past actions, thoughts and emotions will take on new meaning, and you may be able to explain them to yourself for the first time. The act of recalling previously repressed events can relieve some major problems in your life. Some abductees have reported that they are finally able to sleep normally and to go about their daily lives free from anxieties related to these disturbing half-memories and dreams; at least they are able to extricate themselves from the pressure of previously locked-away memories. Through hypnosis it is possible to pull these events up into \"normal\" recall where they can ultimately be dealt with and dismissed. To see a previously buried traumatic event clearly and wholely is to begin the process of removing its power over your life. People who have chosen to go through the process of finding out what happened to them are almost always satisfied with their decision. Selecting an investigator is a critically important part of this recovery process. Your choice should be based on four main criteria. 1. The person must either be a competent hypnotist or must work with one. 2. The investigator and/or hypnotist should be well versed in the patterns of UFO abduction in order to pursue the investigation correctly, helping the subject explore his or her memories smoothly and systematically. 3. The hypnotist should either be a therapist or work with one in order to help the abductee deal with the events that are"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"uncovered. 4. The final criterion is subtle and elusive: Ideally, the investigator and the hypnotist should be particularly sensitive and perceptive, a situation that is difficult to obtain but is perhaps the most valuable of all. If you decide to go ahead with the process of investigation, you must not expect immediately startling revelations. At the outset you should stop all reading about UFOs and the abduction experience, since too much information can complicate the retrieval process. Memory can be faulty even in hypnotic regression arid at first you will probably not be able to tell with absolute certainty what is real and what is imaginary. Discovery is a cumulative learning process. It takes time and a little practice to become comfortable with hypnosis and to concentrate on memory retrieval. And you must remember that it is possible that the dreams and half-memories you are exploring may turn out to have been just dreams and nothing more. Delving into half-remembered experiences can be frightening. Some people are extremely anxious about recalling what happened to them, even though they desperately want to know the truth. An experienced hypnotist knows how to control this fear and can even eliminate it by certain techniques. Researchers are finding that, under hypnosis, fear is strongest at the very beginning of an abduction, but that once this threshold is crossed one's level of fear is greatly reduced. Then curiosity and amazement can displace it among commonly reported reactions. Remember, the decision to recover hidden memories is an extremely important one. It can lead you into an \"adventure\" with both positive and negative developments. It is your life and you must not be pressured into making the decision one way or the other. Whatever your choice, make sure that you have considered it carefully so that it is the one you will be most comfortable and happy with in all the years to come. II. HYPNOSIS — A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE All of us wishing to explore our abduction experiences are faced at some point with the decision of whether or not to undergo hypnosis. On the one hand we wanted to understand what had' happened to us, to uncover our buried memories. On the other hand we were somewhat nervous about the idea of being hypnotized. Most of us had never been hypnotized before and we wondered what it was really like: Would we lose control and be under the power of the hypnotist? Would we blurt out the sordid details of our private lives? What if we weren't able to be successfully hypnotized? There were also the ambivalent feelings about whether we really wanted any hidden memories to surface — we were often afraid of the pain, of the possible impact of those memories on our lives. All in all, the thought of undergoing hypnosis left many of us feeling uncertain and vulnerable. What we've learned about hypnosis since then has been so reassuring! We found out that the person being hypnotized is the one who is basically in charge of things. The hypnotist is there at your request to help you hypnotize yourself, and to serve you as a guide and protector in your explorations. The hypnostist provides the structure and you let the content emerge. Therefore, certain conditions are necessary for hypnosis to work for you. You need to trust your hypnotist, and you must want to be hypnotized — rather than feel it's something you should or must do. So what is hypnosis, anyway? Well, it's really nothing more than a process of deep relaxation, a kind of \"mental backrub.\" It is definitely not a loss of consciousness — you are aware of the hypnotist and of things going on around you in the room. If you've ever done relaxation exercises or listened to relaxation tapes, the process of hypnosis will feel very familiar to you. When you're under hypnosis, you yourself decide what to reveal and what not to reveal. You can refuse to answer questions, and your mind probably won't let memories surface if you're not feeling ready for them. Generally you remember only what you're ready to remember. The hypnotist will use techniques designed to help minimize your fear of threatening memories. Hypnosis seems to work best when you just describe the images as they come to you, rather than censoring them because they're bizarre or don't seem to make any sense to you at the time. There will be plenty of time for you and the hypnotist to sort them out later, after you're out of the trance. Though most sessions last about an hour or so, you can ask to come out of the trance at any time. Also at your request you may have someone you trust — a friend or family member—present with you during the hypnosis sessions. After you've been hypnotized you will most likely remember whatever surfaced during the session, and you might even find more new images coming into your conscious mind during the next several days. These flashbacks can be upsetting, so try to plan how you will take care of yourself during this stressful time. The hypnotist can be a good source of support for you, as can others who have undergone similar experiences. Hypnosis isn't magic. The memories we find can't always feel complete, nor are they all crystal clear, but many of us who have explored our abduction experiences using hypnosis have found it to be an extremely useful tool, one that helped us find and piece together the fragments of our memories. III. SUPPORT GROUPS & CONTAMINATION If you are about to look into your half-remembered recollections and UFO dreams and your intentions are serious, one of the first issues to arise is the problem of possible contamination. Your memories should be your own, untainted, so far as possible, by books you've read or conversations you've had. Therefore, once you've decided to explore your situation, we strongly urge you to avoid reading UFO books or carrying on any communication with abductees about the details of their UFO experiences. It is important to your own sense of the real and the imaginary that you are able, ten years from now, to know that a particular set of details emerged from your own experience and was not something you heard in a conversation 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"or read in a letter from a fellow abductee — or from someone who through! he or she might be. (In one case a well-intentioned but misguided author established a \"network,\", providing anyone who joins his mailing list access to other individuals — genuine abductees as well as possible hoaxers, mentally ill people and marginal cultists — so that all kinds of unexamined and unreliable information can be easily exchanged. The results of such participation could confuse your .situation and make real investigation more difficult.) A . safe and reliable form of communication between those who have already undergone investigation and those about to begin the process — a supportive \"buddy-system\" — has been established by Hopkins, Jacobs and other investigators. The basic arrangement is this: The first name and phone number of an abductee, a volunteer whose case has already been investigated, is given to someone whose UFO memories are about to be explored. Usually a man contacts a man, a woman a woman. The person about to explore his or her experiences is allowed only to question the \"veteran\" about what the investigation itself feels like and how one handles the results, whatever they might be. The \"veteran\" is cautioned never to pass on any details of his or her UFO experiences. Instead, he or she functions as a good listener, a shoulder, perhaps, to cry upon, and a willing source of support. The following are excerpts from a personal letter written by a woman abductee to her \"buddy.\" Though the emotion expressed may seem at times rather intense, the letter illustrates the way the system functions at its best. \"Dear Karen: It is extremely helpful for a victim to have assistance from the 'buddy system' while undergoing hypnosis. Absolutely no one in our environment, no matter how loving, can provide the same service as someone who has experienced this identical trauma. Your great value, Karen, was not .only in providing a sympathetic ear but in the practical advice and information you consistently gave me. While we never once violated the central rule — you 8 never gave information to me about your UFO experiences — the practical information you did provide was so crucial that I wish to write it down for other victims. Your voice was the one sane factor that I clung to when my world of 'realtiy' seemed to be falling apart. \"You explained that while the hypnotic process can be grueling, (after my first session, which was traumatic), it is a vital process that must be explored to unlock the subconscious. Otherwise, the subconscious can literally take energy from the .body to suppress intense feelings of trauma, fear, rage, etc. \"You told me that during the process the anxiety, insomnia, nightmares and flashbacks experienc- ed are 'like an open wound, a wound that will heal. The pain is only a temporary conditon.'  . \"Very important for me, you said, There is nothing you did that could have changed your abduction or the experiences you endured. The process is generally the same, no matter what the victim's reaction. One can respond with tears, hysteria, passivity or rage — the experience would have been, the same.' This observation eliminated the thought that if I had reacted differently I might have suffered less. All abductees should hear these words. \"While the process of hypnosis and the resulting shock is difficult, the benefits are enormous. Victims will have higher self-esteem because they will 'finally understand some quirky traits or fears.' In my case, this was a life-long inability to sleep in the dark without a night-light, or live without a German Shepherd dog in my house at night, preferably sleeping in my bedroom. I now understand the many mornings since 1982 that I awoke with nightmares, terrified out of my mind, with no explanation. \"Most important for victims to hear: We are not psychotic or mentally ill. Many other people have uncovered the same memories and details. While we may have suffered acute anxiety and/or depression, these experiences cannot simply be explained by a mental illness, since abductees who have never met report identical details that have never been made public. As the 'reality' of my past changed and I reported totally bizarre details, Budd or Karen would respond, \"Oh, yes, I've heard that many times before.' This was extremely reassuring. I needed all my energy to deal with the truth as I was discovering it; I had no excess energy to worry about my sanity. However, the rule must be strictly followed that the person receiving hypnosis must be given no prior information about the UFO experiences of her 'buddy.' Otherwise the recovered information cannot be validated. \"Karen, I hope your thoughts on the counseling you gave me will assure you of the tremendous assistance I received from you, and will perhaps help other victims. Your skilled insight prevented permanent trauma. I look forward to meeting you someday in person. Love, Anna\" Every abductee has his or her own way of dealing with whatever encounters have been remembered. Some people are very angry or frightened, some less so. Anna's letter, like any other, contains highly personal observations and attitudes. Nevertheless it presents an ideal example of the \"buddy system\" in operation, and the emotional support it can provide. Support groups, in which a number of abductees gather at intervals for social meetings, have also been extremely helpful to people who have begun investigating their UFO memories and dreams. These informal, basically unstructured groups exist in several cities, such as New York, Philadelphia, Toronto, Los Angeles and Minneapolis, and more are forming all the time. Essentially, these gatherings should be attended only after you have moved rather deeply into the investigation of your half-remembered UFO experiences. Support groups are mentioned here only as a resource that may eventually be available to help ease your handling of potentially isolating UFO recollections. Whether you only suspect that you have had UFO abduction experiences or have already begun exploring them, the problems of what you can disclose — and to whom — can become major"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"issues in your life. As we have mentioned before, you probably have some friends and loved ones who will reject your account out of hand, much to your surprise and disappointment. And yet we feel it is important to have someone — husband, wife, lover, sibling, parent, friend — in whom to confide. None of life's large issues should be borne alone. Once you have decided on an intimate confidant or two it is important to feel out their opinions on the subject of UFOs and the possibility of abductions., It is best to make your personal disclosures when you are relaxed and have plenty of uninterrupted time to talk. Consider the readiness of the other person — is she or he in the most receptive frame of mind to hear about such bizarre- sounding experiences just then? And you must also consider what to disclose and what to hold back for another time. You don't have to tell it all in one sitting, and you needn't tell every detail to every person. (Some abductees have felt embarrassed at the thought of sharing explicit information about intimate, physical aspects of their experiences, so for their own comfort they have witheld that information at certain times.) Rejection will undoubtedly occur, and it is important for you to understand it. People who reject you and/or your UFO abduction experience are probably reacting out of their own fear. After all, you are asking them to change their concept of \"reality,\" and that is something they will naturally resist doing. You might feel hurt by it, but it isn't too surprising. Just remember, their disbelief is their problem, not yours. Being rejected doesn't mean you are crazy, stupid or worthless; it only means some people don't have the capacity or the intellectual resilience to believe you right now. There is, of course, another side of the coin — a positive side. First, as we've mentioned before, the exploration of your nagging, upsetting UFO memories can lead to massive gains in self-awareness and self-respect, accompanied by a lessening of chronic anxiety. And then there will be new friends to meet, people who have, like you, experienced these same bizarre encounters, and with whom profound new relationships may be formed. It is safe to say that your conception of reality itself, will have broadened .considerably, and this can only be viewed as a positive gain. You may finally come to see yourself, correctly, as a survivor, someone surprisingly strong and resilient, someone who has undergone and successfully endured experiences that might have devastated others. Your desire to explore these experiences is, undeniably, a badge of strength. IV. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS The exploration of possible UFO abduction experiences is a time- consuming, often disturbing process, one that is not to be undertaken lightly. To be merely curious is not enough. But if, after reading these pages, you feel that you must have answers and some . kind of emotional relief, this is what we ask you to do. Write to the address below, and enclose a stamped, self- addressed envelope and a note explaining your situation. If you've outlined your recollections in a previous letter, simply state that you wish to go on with an investigation. As time permits you will be sent a list of investigators, hypnotists and therapists located as close as we can determine to your general geographical area. We will also enclose an abductee's account of her thoughts about undergoing this kind of investigation, and what it has meant to her and to other abductees with whom she has discussed the subject. (Her piece, in an edited form, appears in the final chapter of Intruders.) The primer and the pages described above are being provided by individuals and organizations supporting UFO research; there is no fee for you to pay. Postage, however, is costly. It will help us immensely if you place twenty-two cents in stamps on a business-size, self-addressed envelope to cover the cost of sending you this new material.

NEW YORK - The clamorous cry \"To the moon, Alice,\" frequently delivered on \"The Honeymooners\" by the late, great Jackie Gleason, may have been inspired in part by the comic's fascination with outer space. Gleason was an avowed believer in UFOs and, according to his ex- wife Beverly McKittrick. he even got involved in some spaccd-out exploits with his friend Richard Nixon. Beverly was a 37-yi-ar-old divor- cee with a great golf game when Jackie met her at a Miami country club. Their four-year marriage ended in 1974. In her unpublished biography of the funnyman entitled \"The Great One,\" Beverly, .Glcason's second spouse, describes a bizarre trip Jac- kie took with the then-president in 1973 to Homestead AFB in Florida to see what she says were the bodies of four dead space aliens recovered by the Air Force. The aliens were supposedly em- balmed and displayed on operating tables and classified as top-secret material. Gleason and Nixon visited the base under extremely tight secu- rity, she says. \"The significance of ttiis informa- tion is tremendous,\" said Mike I.uck- man, director of the UFO Research Center in New York. \"The four bod- ies that Gleason saw were probably the same ones that the Army recov- ered in 19-17 at Rosewell. N.M. We want to establish that link.'' Gleason had a lifelong interest in the supernatural and accumulated one of the largest private libraries of esoteric and psychic literature in the country.. lie 'even named his, Peekskill, N.Y., home \"The Mothorship\" and had architects build everything in the round to resemble a flying sau- cer. Said Luckman: \"Most of the furni- ture was circular. So was the garage, which he called the Scout Ship.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ABDUCTIONS: A BRITISH SURVEY By Jenny Randies Jenny Randies is director of investigations for BUFORA and most recently the author of \"The UFO Conspiracy.\" The following paper was first presented at the MUFON Symposium in Washing- ton, D.C. I suppose .an indication of how little is known about British Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind is that the most famous must be that of actress Emma Samms (alias Fallen) in the now departed TV soap The Co/bys'. .She was, of course, only pretending (rather badly!) to be an American and, for once, the aliens will not be bringing her back as with the cancelling of the show the betting seems to be that the old standby \"it was all a dream\" will be dusted down and brought off the shelf to get rid of the plot difficulties. Would that it were as simple to get rid of the real CE 4 cases! However, there have been abducti9n cases in Britain.and people studying them, even if unhappily those studying them seem to believe that they have no responsibility to inform the rest of the world's UFO community. This paper, as an inevitably brief summary, aims to redress that balance a little...although I am presently writing a book on these cases (who isn't these days!) and when that is published by Robert Hale early in 1988 it will help elaborate on many of the things I am only able to touch on here. I recall how in late 1975 I wrote an article in Northern UFO News, the magazine I edit, in which I puzzled over the total lack of British abductions. The Travis Walton case had created ripples of interest in Europe and yet nobody had ever, to my knowledge, investigated a similar story on our shores. In fact that was not entirely true. An elderly gentleman called Albert Lancashire had reported in 1969 that he had been kidnapped by aliens whilst on 10 guard patrol at an Army post in north- east England in 1942. His account, which he said had returned in bits and pieces over the previous quarter century, was given to Norman Oliver (then editor of the BUFORA Journal). I met Albert a few years later, when he had just retired from the railroads (where he worked as a signalman) and he briefly described his sighting (and several subsequent events where UFOs appeared over his signal box). The case is a fascinating one, involving as it does very familiar elements (a beam of light sucked him up into a room where figures performed a medical on him as he lay on a table or bed). However, the fact that it was reported after the Hill and Schirmer abduction cases much dilutes its significance. I have looked into this case and several other classic entity sightings reported in pre-abduction days. Following leads has provided fascinating new information on cases such .as that of Jessie Roestenberg (who saw a UFO over her house in Staffordshire during the October 1954 wave) and the strange events in the Birmingham home of housewife Cynthis Appleton in November 1957, when aliens appeared and left physical evidence in the form of a burnt newspaper. I must say that the .long overdue task of reopening these investigations, from an era when nobody seemed too concerned about treating such cases as they would the \"real\" UF.O encounters, has been most enlightening. Both involve major sequels which must wait for the book to reveal, although I will say that they offer clear parallels with modern abductions and have some evidence of being , documented at the time. The Appleton story even includes utterly astonishing physical evidence in the form of a piece of skin left by one of the aliens when a hand was burnt! Returning to 1975, it was Jesus who introduced the era of modern British CE 4s. Before you think I have become a religious fanatic I had best explain that this involved a very odd man called \"Gary\" who turned up at a meeting I was chairing, advised matter of factly that he was \"a representative of the aliens\" and asked to address the gathering. I said no (more out of astonishment than presence of mind!) and he sat down without fuss. However, this was not the last we had seen of Gary. Not by a million light years! A little of the story of the first few months of investigation which Peter Warrington and I conducted into this mega-case was included in UFOs: A British Viewpoint (Robert Hale 1979) If I tell you that a dozen years later Gary is still around and that his story of a childhood UFO abduction, going mad under regression hypnosis when taken back by a psychologist, claiming to be an alien himself (who was Jesus in a former incarnation) and whose revelations and messages down through the past decade have bemused investigators and scientists alike, then you will know why I have said very little about this case. Currently, BUFORA regional investigations coordinator Clive Potter and myself are trying to find a publisher for our book on the story. However, it is rather difficult persuading the stiff-upper-lip brigade of British publishing to take seriously a study of Jesus the alien' whose close encounter drove him round the bend! Whatever the truth about Gary (and it is far from clear) he did make a very specific promise to Peter Warrington and I late in 1975. The present dearth in CE 4 cases would end. Unlike most abductee predictions this one came astoundingly true. 1976 was without question Britain's \"year of abductions\" and still holds the record for more CE 4 cases than any other in the UK. It would be impossible to even"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"begin to describe them all and many only emerged years later. Most have something illuminating to tell us. One of the cases was 1 the bizarre story of the Sunderland family from North Wales (recounted in my 1982 book Alien Contact. This was a precedent for the \"Copley Woods\" affair which Budd Hopkins has so ably researched. It involved several members of the family in a quiet coastal village seeing aliens and in at least two cases supposedly being abducted. Gaynor Sunderland alleged several separate experiences but the fact that children were the focii of this case probably detracts from its evidential status...as does the amazing (for no other word suffices) things that Gaynor and her mother have gone on to do in the realms of psychic phenomena. In my opinion the Sunderland case has a lot to say about the nature of CE 4's but is little understood outside of British ufology because the direction it points so clearly is not extra-terrestrial. MOVIE? These aliens were from inner space, even if that inevitable conclusion seems unpalatable. However, simple delusions, fantasies or other stock psychoanalytical answers will positively not do. The truth about this case is as complex as any other and remains unresolved. There has been interest from Hollywood about turning the book into a movie (and names such as Jacqueline Bisset and Oliver Reed have even been tied in with the project). Nothing has ever come of it and frankly I am not terribly surprised.' To produce a sort of \"ET meets the family in the English countryside\" (Wales is not in England, but few in Hollywood seem to know that!) would not do justice to the subtle depths of this case or the abduction phenomenon in general. I doubt if you can make a movie that does, although maybe the one based on Whitley Strieber's \"novel\" will succeed. I hope so. Three of the 1976 cases directly related to Gary the alien. It was this incredible aspect that first made me wonder if the truth was far more complex than I had ever dreamt. One (the abduction from Bolton, Lancashire, of Shelley Barnes) has already been written up at length in Fate, so I will not duplicate Peter Hough's summary. He did not mention that Shelley and Gary had a weird telepathic rapport on the phone following one of her\" hypnosis sessions. The Bolton case was followed up immediately but its nature as a time- lapse abduction only emerged in January 1984 when Shelley called me after reading The Pennine UFO Mystery, my 1983 book about a police officer abducted from his patrol car in Yorkshire. The other two relevant CE 4s both came to light almost immediately in 1976. ABDUCTION In one, an ambulance driver from Leeds claimed that two grey skinned beings appeared in his bedroom and sucked him into their UFO via the roof. He was given a medical on a table or bed, with a large eye-like probe overhead. They gave him a number of images and treated him rather cooly. But when he reported that they had said, \"A thousand of your years are but a day to us\" (a strange Biblical quotation) Peter and I were staggered. There was no conceivable link with Gary. The ambulance driver did not see any significance in this phrase. But we did! Gary had spoken the exact same words to us a few weeks before! That might conceivably have been a coincidence. Not so the strange case of Joyce Bowles and Ted Pratt, out for a late night drive near Winchester in Hampshire in November 1976. Although Joyce and Ted went on to have an actual abduction (during which one of the aliens told her they had not come to invade and she replied, \"That's what Hitler said!\", in the first \"preparation phase\" sighting their car was simply hauled across the road where a UFO landed on the verge and a figure got out and came up to the windscreen. When BUFORA followed up the case rapidly Peter and I were in for another surprise. The alien was most unusual (bearded and with pink eyes). Joyce Bowles drew him..and there was no question that it was more than a passing likeness for \"our alien\" - Gary! After that I stopped smiling at CE 4 cases and started to take a deep interest in coincidence. Magon/a (the British UFO Journal edited by John Rimmer-whose book The Evidence for Alien Aductions is the only one published in Britain exclusively about CE 4s) is totally persuaded that the answer is psychological (although such airey-fairey theories usually stop at that as if it was an explanation!). They were not too pleased with my obsession for coincidences (as they termed it), but I think I was justified and all that I have learnt has demonstrated to me the relevance. Whether someone, somewhere is sending coded messages or whether this is a pointer to the subjective nature of the CE 4, remains to be seen. But it is an important clue that cannot be easily overlooked. HYPNOSIS None of these stories involved hypnosis (although in 1978 there was hypnosis carried out into the first Gaynor Sunderland encounter and it did nothing except relive what she had already described consciously). The first CE 3 to emerge by way of hypnosis was investigated by Andy Collins and Barry King for BUFORA (although I was present at one of the hypnosis sessions and have spoken to the main witness since). This was the classic abduction of John and Sue Day and their three children from Aveley in Essex. The case happened in October 1974, but was not reported until August 1978. The near two hour time lapse and recurrent nightmare images of small, ugly creatures performing a medical examination had plagued John and Sue (the children were too young and this was never discussed in front of them). Hypnosis, initially by Dr. Leonard Wilder (and reported in FSR at the time) and later by Collins himself produced a staggering wealth of detail about the onboard encounter. The Aveley case was followed in June 1978 (reported immediately but studied. under hypnosis before the Aveley case went public) by another five person abduction...this one involving, husband, wife, and two children plus the sister of the husband. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The case is most interesting for the way an academic professor and a psychiatrist -wrecked it. I had the misfortune of putting them onto the case, thinking the team would conduct a genuine enquiry. Sadly, the professor became so taken in by the saga, that emerged under hypnosis that his subsequent book (The Janos People, Spearman, 1980) reads like a fairy tale. There is substance behind the case, although seeing it is not easy. When 'Frank Johnson, the professor, ended his book by suggesting to the inhabitants of New Zealand that they ship their people off one island and leave the other free for the aliens from Janos to \"come and live in peace\" he lost most if not all of his credibility. Nevertheless the story is very illuminating about how hypnosis can taint an investigation and having spoken to the family before Frank Johnson and his hypnotist got involved and later, when the professor left the country in despair that people laughed at his book, I can see some of the lessons the, case teaches. There has been a steady stream of GE 4s since, mostly investigated by Manchester lawyer Harry Harris and a small team he gathered together. Some are impressive (such as the police officer, Alan Godfrey, kidnapped from his car in November 1980 by the obligatory small robotic creatures determined to give him a medical...or the three women from Shropshire again taken from their, car in July 1981 and each with a different tale to tell under hypnosis) Whilst Harris is very good at spending money on these cases (he paid a fortune for highly qualified medical practitioners to perform the repeated hypnosis sessions) he was not so hot on documenting them. A couple were sold to the tabloid press to recoup his costs (and may have found their way to the National Enquirer I suspect in garbled and half true form). But his investigations largely comprised recording all the sessions on video tape. I was involved in some of these cases, if only because Police Officer Godfrey asked me to write his story into a book. During the time I worked on this in 1982 and 19831 attended quite a few of the sessions on other cases out of the ten which the Harris team have 12 Manchester Attorney Harry Harris studied. I also saw the video films of others and spoke to witnesses and to doctors involved. Being an attorney Harry Harris is obsessed with legalities and I have never tried to document the evidence that has emerged...hoping (against hope as it turned out) that he would produce reports himself for the UFO community. Now, however, I feel that I have to report what 1 saw and discovered whatever consequences Mr. Harris might bring to bear. The material should be viewed by UFO researchers. PATTERNS What of overall patterns? There are some very interesting and important ones. For example, most British CE 4s do not involve small entities with large heads, huge black eyes and other features so typical to Budd Hopkins' case file. Many are in fact larger than normal height, or at least of ordinary dimensions. This is a crucial piece of information as it must make one cautious of accepting the American stereotype as anything other than the \"national alien,\" rather like a national emblem. There are suspicious hints that every society has one. That said there are many very obvious comparisons with American cases, including the image of the table/bed, the medical examination, gynaecological features and in three cases I know of missing baby syndromes. Since Budd Hopkins book Intruders has not been published here as I write (nor indeed has his first) the details of his investigations are totally unknown to most people in Britain. This makes such dramatic parallels extremely important. Two fairly dramatic types of case exist....Type A and Type C as I call them (Type B are \"Bedroom Visitor\" cases which have other features). Type A are consciously remembered and Type C emerge out of hynptic regression. The British Type A cases I studied for this paper show an average number of witnesses per case of 1.45 (the figure for a sample of standard UFO cases without abduct ion elements was 2.55). Of these 69 per cent were male. When the cases that involve repressed memory or emerge under hypnosis are examined the average number of witnesses per case rises to 2.3 (not very disimilar from standard non alien UFO sightings) and the percentage of male witnesses falls to just 26 per cent. This means that when male witnesses are involved they tend to be alone, or nearly alone, and to remember details of their experience. When women have abduction experiences there are often others with them and they very frequently repress"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"all memory. An interesting myth about hypnosis is that it a/iuays stimulates a fantasy abduction. I am sure Philip Klass or Alvin Lawson would like to believe that but it isn't so. The very first hypnotic regression in Britain (into the Gaynor Sunderland case) revealed no new memory. Of the cases. Harry Harris investigated with his psychologists only seven of them seem to have produced abduction memories. Three did not, despite equal amounts of pressure on the witness to \"justify the excess cost\" which they always knew to be involved in the sessions. Of the seven cases which did come out, incidentally, only three were willing to go along with any form of media publicity. As Budd Hopkins has discovered abductees are extremely reluctant to go public. Some of the recurrent features in British abductions which I find most interesting are the presence of small balls of light, often seen in the bedroom whilst the abductee is a child, the history of previous time lapses never before suspected as relevant, the astonishing history of psychic experiences which abductees almost always claim, and the absolutely universal conviction that the abduction just experienced is not the last that the witness will endure. Many were given specific promises or dates for the next appearance! I am also on the track of oblique contacts, where alien messages appear to find their way into the most unlikely of places. One bizarre example is the case of Rikki Peebles, a Scottish pop singer. He won the British heats of a competition to find the best song of 1987, appearing with many other hopefuls during March on the TV chat show \"Wogan\" which Whitley Strieber was to grace two months later. Rikki's song was called \"Only the Light\" and he sang as well as wrote it. The winning song represented Britain in the \"Eurovision Song Contest,\" an annual marathon spectacle that is screened all over the world and draws an enormous audience. About 25 European countries enter original songs and national juries vote the winner. It is interminable and the standards often dreadful (one of the few real successes came some years ago when the group Abba won with their tune \"Waterloo\" and went on to enjoy international stardom). \"Only the Light\" was typical of the turgid songs that fill the contest. What made it different was Peebles claim that he wrote it under dictation from the aliens! Allegedly, he had a close encounter near Glasgow in 1984 when he was hit by a beam of light from a UFO. He then developed ESP and his head filled with strange words and messages. The lyrics of the song (\"its only the light, that comes in the night\" — yes they were that bad!) told of his encounter and, he proudly announced to the world, the aliens had promised that he would win in the competition when staged in May. The lights went down before the packed, crowd in Brussels (since Belgium won the 1986 contest and the burden of putting on the following show always falls on the winners — possibly explaining why some countries consistently enter utter drivel and often score not a single point!) Rikki Peebles screached out his tune to less than rapturous applause. Two hours later yet another alien promise bit the dust. While \"Only the Light\" might be the current number one in the Martian discos it was voted only thirteenth in Europe. Perhaps we now know why the aliens never seem to open their mouths. If \"Only the Light\" is an example of what might come out it is possibly a good thing that they don't! JINDABYNE \"ABDUCTION\" By Mark Moravec Mark L. Moravec is a MUFON field investigator and the Investigations and Reports Coordinator for the Australian Centre for UFO Studies, Pymble, New South Wales, Australia. Ever since the emergence of the UFO abduction claim of Betty and Barney Hill in the 1960s, there has been a growth in both the reporting of, and controversy about, such claims. The debate centers on whether abduction experiences are best explained as literal physical abductions by \"alien entities;\" psychological manifestations incorporating hallucinations, false hypnotic regression \"memories\" and cultural beliefs in alien visitors; or a combination of physical and psychological causes, such as a physical manifestation triggering hallucinatory experiences. In September, 1984,1 interviewed a 21-year-old man who claimed to have consciously recalled a childhood abduction by UFO entities. What follows then is one perspective on one abduction report. THE LIGHT The events began with the sighting of a nocturnal light. As far as the percipient can recall, the date was most likely the 27th of September, 1974. The percipient was aged about 11 years at the time. He and a 19-year-old friend were spotlighting animals on a 40 hectare property several kilometers from Jindabyne in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales. At about 9 p.m., they spotted a bright white spherical light on the ground about 800 meters away. The light appeared to be constant and was estimated to be about 3 meters across and twice the apparent size of the full moon. Although the light was bright, it did not appear to cast much light about it. The light was observed for 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"approximately half an hour. They conjectured that it was possibly a farmer's light but it was too far away and too cold to make a definite identification. A later inspection by daylight revealed nothing in the field, not even a road. The following evening at about 8 p.m., the two young men were with several other friends when they all saw the stationary light again. It was in sight for between one and two hours. At the time, they did not give it much attention. THE ABUCTION About nine years after these sightings, the reporting percipient began to have vivid memories of that first evening. He realized that they had taken about two hours to walk only one kilometer. Over a period of approximately six months, he experienced vivid images. The percipient felt that this was material he wasn't supposed to recall. As he related in his initial letter (spelling corrected): / realized that after seeing the light there was a time lapse of some two hours. I would remember bits and pieces of our walk but it was so dreamlike compared to the memories I was having. I was not asleep. I saw myself and my friend approach the light but we weren't walking. We were wrapped in a blue light ourselves. We floated in a doorway into a complex room of tubes and benches, etc. We were laid on a table. All the while tall thin beings with arms and legs — long fingers (no joints) smooth grey skin and smooth noseless faces watched and kind of squirmed (like when we are waiting in a queue). The room was grey blue (they were light grey) and a bluish light seemed to emanate from the corners of the walls and ceilings. The room was cramped and square.... The beings had just enough room to get in between us and around us. They had cream-colored overhead lights to look at us with. We lay there and could see them lean over us. They hooked up wires to our skin and seemed to be able to pull our clothes open without tearing them. They seemed very busy at the time and often would look at each other and pass instruments from one another. As far as I could interpret they were gauging how electromagnetic fields related to my body and the atmosphere. I remember my friend (older than I) tried to resist (he 'came around') but they took him away only to return him. His eyes were sunken, he was pale and very cooperative. (He passed out once he lay down.) The tests went on for some time and after literally hundreds of wires had been connected they just took them off, closed up my clothes and left us both. We were not afraid but were not really conscious either. They put us back where we had first seen them and that was that. I remember that we regained consciousness after walking across a ridge and spotting a horse. THE BEINGS During the interview, the percipient described the events and \"beings\" in further detail. At the time of the sighting, it was dead quiet; there was no noise made by crickets, rabbits or other animals. A low whistling, howling hum was heard from the object. Inside the object were benches and cupboard with shelves on which were tools and instruments. Panels of red and yellow lights flashed on and off. The interior was a matte grey colour. The entities were first seen when the percipients were floated towards the object. The entities were floating outside the hatch which was slowly opening. The young men were placed on two benches in the rectangular room. Three entities examined them while a fourth entity intermittently came into and out of the room. The \"beings\" were over two meters tall, very thin, hairless, had grey bulges where the eyes should be, slit-like mouths, flat noses and no apparent ears. The feet were not noticed. It was unclear whether or not the entities wore any clothing. If they did, it would have been a skin-tight covering. No features were observed which would distinguish the entities as either male or female. The entities floated when they were outside the object but walked with very large steps when they were inside. They moved in such a flexible way that they apparently lacked most normal bodily joints, excepting neck to head. The fingers were long and boneless and all had the same flexible mobility as a human thumb. The entities communicated with each other by gestures. Though no words or sounds were exchanged, the entities seemed to know what was going on and what they had to do. When the beings touched him, the percipient could feel that they were warmer than humans. THE DREAM It consisted of me and a friend flying a spacecraft onto a landing pad of ice, like somewhere in the north pole. Huge ice islands surrounded us and many other similar (and dissimilar) craft were \"parked\" there. • The two went into one \"ship\" and walked into a control room. The crew came in and indicated they shouldn't be there. The percipients disappeared through a white wall which went transparent and into a dark blue region which looked like space. After wafting through this void, the percipient remembered coming down to a place. He had the body of a fox and was running around trees and catching animals. It snowed very heavily until he, as the fox, was snowed under. He regained his human form and then a large faceless being with a human-like body dressed in furs reached down into the snow and pulled the percipient out. The being then also pulled a woman out of the snow. The being said, \"This is yours. Go.\" The dream occurred in the morning, shortly before waking up. The percipient's immediate reaction after waking was: \"What a surprise. Why should I have such a strange dream?\" He had slept in his usual sleep pattern: heavy and continuous. The percipient only recalls his dreams rarely. When he does, they are usually vivid and in color. One interpretation of the dream is 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"that it represents a simple wish fulfilment, whereby the dreamer has been accorded the power of a wild animal and the easy possession of a woman. THE PERCIPIENT When the reporting percipient first began to remember the \"abduction\" experience, he had \"powerful emotions of real tear and the feeling like I had been 'raped' — used like some specimen and dumped.\" He couldn't think about the beings without nearly crying with fear. He resented having been used and interpreted the entity's reaction as that of routine — \"just another night's work.\" These feelings were alleviated somewhat after attending several meditation sessions. The percipient feels that he most likely remembered the incident as a result of his meditation activities. About two years ago, he started doing transcendental meditation (concen- trating on the after-image of a candle or concentrating on a word or \"mantra\") and the \"abduction memories\" began about 8-12 months later. The experience has stimulated an interest in mathematics and the physics of time and space. The percipient has become interested in such things as the numerical relationships between the sun and the earth and ideas of alternate forms of movement within time-space. The experience has also stimulated an interest in UFOs. Following the recall of the \"abduction,\" the percipient has read several books about UFOs including the first three books by Bruce Cathie and Alien Honeycomb. He has seen the movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" on television, but this was after he had recalled his own experiences. About three years ago, he saw a documentary hosted by Leonard Nimoy (probably an episode of the In Sear/i Of television series) where hypnotic regression techniques were used on UFO witnesses. He has seen Von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods. As a young child, he had watched the science fiction TV series Lost In Space and My Favorite Martian. He has had some interest in occult phenomena since the age of eight and has read one book on psychedelic experiences: Leary's The Politics of Ecstasy. Has the percipient experienced any other anomalous or paranormal phenomena? He has not had any other UFO sightings. On rare occasions when he has been tired and affected by alcohol, he as seen \"colours\" upon falling asleep. His eyes have been closed when he had such experiences. As far as \"psychic\" experiences, the percipient believs he has an intuition. Several times he has had premonitions of forthcoming events. He believes he has developed some degree of psychic ability through his meditation. He has had several mystical and psychedelic experiences during meditation. On one occasion, about two or three years ago, he saw an apparition for several seconds while walking up a flight of stairs. The apparition was an indefinite whitish light and was situated at the bottom of the stairs. It touched him and he felt the sensation of a hand. He was scared and ran up the stairs into his bedroom. As far as he knows, none of his relatives are psychic or have had psychic experiences. The percipient states he has never had blackouts, never sleep walked and has never been hypnotized. The percipient has been working as a professional musician for the last year. He describes himself as a stable, intuitive person with a good understanding of human conscious- ness. He stated he would be willing to participate in any studies, including hypnotic regression, that might be able to validate his claims. EVALUATION During the interview, the percipient presented himself as a sincere and stable person with no obvious indications of a hoax or psychological problems. There was, however, an initial discrepancy relating to the date of the first UFO sighting. In his letter, the percipient claimed he was aged \"16 going on 17\" when he had his UFO experience. During the interview, he claimed he was actually aged 11 or 12. Upon further questioning, he stated the younger age was correct and that he had been too hasty in writing his letter and therein had given the incorrect age. The nocturnal light sightings were allegedly witnessed by one other person in the first case and by several others during the second night. At this state, none of the other witnesses has been located or questioned. Attempts to contact the second UFO witness to the first sighting through one of the percipient's relatives have solar proved unsuccessful. There is no physical evidence accompanying the sightings of the lights. At the time, the percipients did not specifically look for any physical evidence following their sightings. The percipient feels that the abduction experiences were recalled with such vividness that this indicates they actually happened. The two most commonly suggested interpretations of \"UFO abduction\" cases (apart from hoaxing) are that they actually occurred as physically real events, or that they are psychological in origin, i.e. hallucinatory. The psychological hypothesis for this case could be postulated as follows: The percipients misperceived a mundane light source (such as a bright astronomical object close to the horizon — note the light was visible on two consecutive nights for relatively extended durations). The reporting percipient's meditation activities triggered an abduction fantasy. Because the experience was very vivid, having occurred during an altered state of consciousness, it was mistakenly interpreted as a recall of actual events. The percipient's early occult beliefs and other claimed psychic experiences also influenced him towards making a literal interpretation of his fantasy. The content and themes of the abduction fantasy originated from diverse sources ranging from early science-fiction TV series to contemporary media UFO reports. There are several precedents which indicate the percipient could be prone to subjective experiences of an exotic nature, e.g. psychedelic and mystical experiences during meditation, the UFO dream and the 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"apparition experience. It should be noted that the vividness of the experience does not necessarily indicate actual physical occurrence. Psychological studies of altered states of consciousness induced a variety of means indicate that hallucinatory experiences are often perceived as being very vivid and the percipient is sometimes completely convinced that the experiences were physically-occurring events. There appears to be a reasonable probability that the nocturnal light sightings occurred as originally described. But due to the lack of any supportive physical evidence or corroboration by other witnesses, there is at present no evidence to confirm that the \"abduction\" experience occurred as a real physical event. If a psychological interpretation is favored, the following questions are raised: What initiated such an experience? Why should this particular person have this experience? And why is there a consistency in the themes of this case and of other abduction cases? The Jiridabyne case appears to be a typical example of the UFO abduction claims that have been reported from many countries over the last two decades. BOOKS.

Consequently, the more electronically inclined readers of the Journal will be interested to learn of the existence of ParaNet, a computer network designed as a forum for discussion of paranormal issues. The network is operated by several volunteers in 11 cities nationwide, and is expanding rapidly. ParaNet's purpose is manifold: to provide the latest and most reliable information on various aspects of the so-called \"fringe sciences,\" in order to facilitate their forthright discussion; to educate the public as to the usefulness of, and the appropriate application of, skepticism and the scientific method in dealing with such issues; and to act as a permanent storage facility for research papers, newsclippings, press releases, magazine articles, anecdotes, \"captured\" discussions, and other timely and useful information, so that future generations can benefit from the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"day-to-day intercourse of ideas. Due to my involvement with the UFO issue, as a MUFON State Section Director and contributor to the Journal, and due to Ufology's tendency to \"stand out\" as one of the most promising fields of study, ParaNet has become inextricably associated with the UFO phenomenon. Many of our users access the database solely for reliable UFO-related information, which we provide to them through our numerous contacts in the field, and to communicate with various experts and researchers on both sides of the issue. ParaNet has taken on a quasi- journalistic quality, and thanks to the instantaneous nature of computer communications, ParaNet users were among the first in the nation to learn of the Japan Airlines sighting over Alaska (we reported it in mid-December of 1986), the release of the MJ-12 documents by William Moore, and the Dear Editor, Joe Kirk Thomas and MUFON, that is, Dennis Stacy and Walt Andrus are all to be tendered hearty congratulations for the excellent work done on \"The Vehicle Interference Effect\" paper in the September 1987 issue. I must take exception to the editor's note that appears just before the references. Joe Thomas's work .is quite original and is not an extension of work previously published by James McCampbell or Donald A. Johnson. As an electrical engineer quite interested in electromagnetic emanations from UFOs, I have carefully followed McCampbell's and Thomas's work over the years and I know the basic beliefs of each of them with respect to vehicle interference. McCampbell believes these effects are due to pulsed 3 gigahertz microwave radiation. Thomas's work shows clearly that vehicle interference can be explained by low frequency magnetic fields, approximately between 10 and 1000 hertz, a far cry from 3 gigahertz, a \"mini-flaps\" in Virginia and Pennsylvania. It was also our sad duty to be the first mass media .in the world to report the death of Dr. Hynek in April of 1986. Computer users who own a modem and telecommunications software can access ParaNet's main \"node\" in Fountain Hills, AZ, by dialing 602-837-0062, at 300, 1200, or 2400 baud.

In 1984 MUFON published two of Thomas's papers about these same low frequency magnetic fields. In April Thomas showed analytically and experimentally that the heating of finger rings can be explained by low frequency magnetic fields and not by microwaves. Then in September he explained the sensation of body heating and the charring of grass roots in the Florida Scoutmaster case analytically using these same magnetic fields. In the recent paper, Thomas references McCampbell's microwave hypothesis in his historical background, however McCampbell does not reference Thomas's works in his latest publication. For instance in his chapter \"Effects of UFOs Upon People\" in the new British book UFO's 1947-1987 edited by Hilary Evans with John Spencer, McCampbell has a section entitled \"Review of Magnetic Effects\" in which he gives four references. None of them are to Thomas's work which most Also available on CompuServe is a weekly discussion of paranormal issues, with the accent on UFOs.

Seguin, Texas 78155 certainly should have been included. I know each of these gentlemen and respect both of them for their beliefs and writings not to mention their experimentations; however I most certainly do not believe that Thomas's recent work grows out of anything that McCampbell has written. It may be that the editor had space to fill when he came up with that note. It may have been better to say something to the effect that MUFON has served a very important purpose and mission in providing a platform for work such as Thomas's and others including McCampbell's and Johnson's. Or it may have been more accurate to say that the vehicle interference work grew out of Thomas's earlier work published in the MUFON UFO Journal. -Robert Willsey Claremont (More correspondence on following pages.) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Dear Editor, The main points of Robert Willsey's letter are well taken. The research by Thomas is • totally independent of mine: Secondly, Thomas has established a milestone in private experimentation and analysis. Finally, the only place • where such material can be published for review and discussion is the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. My. failure to reference the article by Thomas in the September 1984 Journal was ah oversight but there are dozens of similar references that had to be omitted for lack of space. Apologies to Thomas. Thomas and I have been in contact by phone and letter since 1983 and have shared review comments on each other's research reports. He may have shown previously that a finger ring will not resonate to microwaves of short wavelength but one may be assured that a metallic ring in a microwave field will be heated. Regarding the \"vehicle study\" by Thomas, I have some reservations that were discussed with him after reviewing the draft. Light from a plasma is increased by a magnetic field so the slow|y pulsing, or throbbing, lights in the sky suggest the rate of magnetic field changes. Also, the spinning of compasses by weak magnetic fields must be nearly synchronous with their natural frequencies. I found that liquid- filled compasses could be driven at about 6 to 20 rpm depending upon the strength of the magnetic pulse and demonstrated it during a private meeting at the Pasadena Symposium with Thomas observing. These rotation and pulse rates are very slow, 0.10 to 0.33 sec- 1 or one every 10 seconds to one every 3 seconds. The MUFON UFO Journal of October 1976 (p.ll) reported a compass spin measured by a pilot at 12 rpm or one revolution in 5 seconds. I have also described other experiments in the JOURNAL of March 1987 showing that static magnetic fields will detune radios and a slowly changing field will tune in a series of stations across the dial. Furthermore, magnetic fields with frequencies from 10 to 1,000 Hz would have erased magnetism that has been reportedly induced in steel objects near Joe Kirk Thomas UFOs. These observations are at variance with the conclusions of Thomas. He has certainly raised some excellent points, but 1 think that we have not yet obtained the final answers. —James McCampbell Belmont, CA Dear Editor: The MUFON UFO Journal deserves praise for Bob Cribble's LOOKING BACK feature which has appeared in the last few issues. Many newcomers to the field of ufology will be pleased with this historical review which will acquaint them with significant cases from the past. I have been attempting to prevail on Bob to include the pertinent references for those desiring to dig more deeply. This, incidentally, would enchance the appeal and quality of the articles. In the last installment (No. 234, Oct. 1987), I have found a couple of points that need clarification. First, the 671001 (October 1, 1967) encounter reported by Valeriano Ruiz is a hoax (Ref. 1); and in hindsight, this becomes quite obvious from the stylized narrative. Second, Bob Gribble indicates that \"no significant reports\" are on file for October, 1972. According to the UNICAT data base, this.is.nqt correct, as two very important cases occurred during that period: i) On 721023 aCanadian aircraft en route from Churchill to Yellowknife, Manitoba, encountered a UFO reportedly larger than a B-747 while Hying 165 miles NE of Churchill (Ref. 2 and 3). ii) The best investigated, but perhaps not well-known, Uruguayan case took place on 721028, when a corporal of the Uruguayan Navy had an unexpected and shocking encounter at a remote lighthouse post (Ref. 4).

Pursuant to this endeavor CAUS is pleased to share with you a recent FOIA release entitled \"German Flying Wings Desinged By Horton Brothers.\" I can assure you that CAUS has made no deletions in this document. I personally believe this document is a first step in explaining the nature and origin of the strange and unusual objects seen in the. skies from 1946 through 1952'. Hopefully, in the near future, CAUS will be obtaining still unreleased documents concerning these objects, specifically the Swedish Ghost Rockets, Foo Fighters, Green Fireballs and Flying Discs as well as other documents relevant to the technological development of that time. The UFO field has been divided over the MJ-12/Project Aquarius documents and whether William Moore is merely an innocent dupe or actively involved in this fiasco. It is my own opinion that the MJ-12/Project Aquarius documents are obviously and undoubtedly fakes; that no extraterrestrial craft crashed in New Mexico in 1947, but rather an aerial device from a top secret Government project located in Sandia; that William Moore, rather than being an innocent dupe, was and still is actively and intentionally engaged in a continuing program of disinformation involving fraudulent documents. Lastly, I suggest that anyone wishing to have a proper perspective of the period from approximately 1940, read the fiction book \"Genesis\" by W.A. Harbinson, the non-fiction book Intercept - But Don't Shoot by Renalto Vesco and Air Intelligence Division Study No. 203, dated December 10, 1948 Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S: — Peter Gersten New York Dear Editor, The response from Mrs. Betty Hill to my article on her \"landing site\" (June 1987 edition of the MUFON UFO Journa/)serves further to illustrate the correctness of my analysis regarding this alleged site and related UFO topics. The following discussion should provide additional clarification of the situation. The Hills and others were, no doubt, aware for some years of UFO activity in the general area of the exact \"landing site,\" which is at the road- railroad intersection as specified in my article. But prior to the immediate context of the attempted contact of 2/15/74 — yes, that's what it actually was — that certain location evidently held no particular significance for Betty, and assuredly it was not regarded by her as a \"landing site.\" The fact that Friday, February 15, 1974, was one of my many birthday anniversaries was incidental in my thinking. That date was probably largely determined because I worked nights on an irregular schedule. On the night of Friday, April 15, 1977, I did accompany Betty, an A.F. Lt. Col., and two others to the site in question. Mrs. Hill had told me on 4/10/77 of a UFO landing she witnessed there one or two days earlier. During the day on 4/15/771 phoned the Lt. Col. to make sure he and I both understood what was likely to happen that night. He and I were fully in agreement at the time of my call and also at all points during the outing of that night, which was for me essentially a social occasion. In Betty's response to my article, the head-under-dashboard UFO sighting that she elaborately recounts is a fictitious event: it did not happen! One can note, however, that with Betty driving, when we neared the now celebrated site on the night of 4/15/77 a light became visible through the trees to our right as we were proceeding in a turn to the right. Betty promptly and emphatically declared that the light was a landed UFO. Then as we rounded the curve she acknowledged her mistake since this \"landed UFO\" was obviously only a thoroughly mundane light attached to someone's home above the front door. For the record I would like to state here, too, that on Sunday, October 14, 1973, when Mrs. Hill and I visited the site where she and Barney were reportedly abducted in the White Mountains her responses to my prolonged and detailed questioning seemed generally convincing. Indeed, there was a very sandy clearing of about the correct size and a trail leading through an interval of forest from the road to the site. As she explained to me then, Barney's map sketch, which is published in The Interrupted Journey (Dell Publishing Co., Inc., see following p. 176), has the object landed on the wrong side of the road relative to their car. This error may have resulted because after the abduction the car was found parked headed in the opposite direction from that in which the Hills had left it. —John Paul Oswald Hampton, NH Dear Editor, This letter is in response to \"Sensory & Psychic UFO Exper- iences,\" by Dr. Arlan Andrews, which appeared in the October issue of the Journal. It's also a long-overdue response to what I consider to be a disturbing trend in UFO research. I've been a regular and faithful reader of everything I've been able to find published about UFOs ever since I first picked up a copy of Fly ing Saucers: Serious Business/ when I was eleven years old. In the early 1970's I was disturbed to see UFO books moved from the Science section of my local bookstore to the less honorable Occult aisle! Even more disturbing is their current position on the \"New World Movement\" shelf at many stores! I believe that this has happened because many UFO researchers and authors on the subject began linking UFOs with psychic phenomena. I also think that occurred because reliable people have taken, far too seriously, stories of alleged \"psychic contacts\" between UFOs and contactees. In my opinion, this link is a terrible error and is largely responsible for the current, apathetic attitude of many people toward the study of UFOs. Beyond this, it seems to be steering us toward a false conclusion that the same 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"hard evidence that supports the actual existence of UFQs also supports this psychic link. In my mind, this link does not exist and is a serious waste of time, energy and funds that could be far better used in other areas of UFO research! The fact is that people aren't taking UFOs as seriously as they once did because serious researchers have taken to making statements that tend to echo beliefs and ideas held by the likes of Shirley MacLaine. Anyone who's read Out on a Limb knows that the book should have been called Out of Her Mind! People that do believe in the psychic link theory should sit down and learn a lesson from human nature. Anything that humans cannot explain within their own frame of reference, they either ignore or diefy. It seems the latter is fast becoming the case when it comes to UFOs. I contend that a good example of this is the average contactee case. Most of these experiences seem to progress from a simple encounter (of varying degrees) with a UFO to a near religious experience! Much of that experience comes out \"later\" either through hypnosis or a later memory of the event. I consider these things, in the context of a UFO Encounter, to be highly suspect and, possibly, unreliable. If the subconscious mind were simply the \"tape recorder\" many believe it to be, these accounts would be. reliable. But, when faced with an experience as intense and unfathomable as a UFO encounter, the mind tends to justify, explain or interpret the event into terms we can understand or believe in. The best evidence for this view is UFO abduction cases where several people are involved. All involved seem to recall (presently, or later under hypnosis) the basic facts of the encounter. Yet, invariably, a later hypnosis session or remembrance produces differing views, bizarre psychic experiences and a basically uneven story when comparisons are made. These changes, additions or deletions tend to make the argument for some sort of psychic connection based on hypnotic or later remembrance evidence seem dubious 20 at best. Ufology shouldn't be allowed to become a religion. It should always be, and remain, a serious search for the truth. This search must be limited to facts and.evidences we can scientifically examine.  .  • • I have no doubt that my view will not be a popular one with many UFO researchers. Yet; I feel my concerns that UFOs be kept out of the realm of mysticism are valid. I believe we should stop looking at UFOs and their occupants as \"higher powers\" and get back to seeing them as interplanetary, or at least mechanically advanced, visitors of some sort. Like most believers in UFOs, I try to keep an open mind. But, as anyone who has studied this phenomenon for any length of time will tell you, appearances can be deceptive and misleading. We must stick to what stands up under extreme and scientific scrutiny. Psychic experiences simply have not proven out under any sort of laboratory conditions of study. If one thing has held true in Ufology, it's that rumor rules and any explanation is better than no explanation at all. Such is the birthright of this psychic nonsense. Let's get back to basics and down to business when it comes to UFOs. —William E. Knell Flushing, NY LOOKING BACK, Continued at a low altitude towards them. It suddenly stopped and began descending noiselessly, stopping at a height of 3 meters and a distance of 25 meters from the witnesses. Describing the occupant, Alvarez said, \"a hatch opened and down a small ladder came a humanoid figure, 1.80 meters tall, dressed up in a one-piece, silver- colored suit which covered him from neck to feet, and seemed to have scales on it. The being also carried a scaphander and wore mitts on his hands.\" According to the witnesses, the being walked a few steps towards them, extended his hands as if saluting and returned to his spaceship, which took off immediately..Other witnesses were bank employees Pedro Sosa and Regino Perroni. A communique issued by the provincial police suggested that the police force which investigated, obtained evidence that a being four times heavier than a normal man did walk around the landing place of the alleged UFO, making strides 1.60 meters long, when the human pace is some 75 centimeters. Tracks measured 30 centimeters long, .17 wide, and 6 deep, with deep heel impressions. MUFON 103 Oldtowne Rd. Seguin, Texas 78155 Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood INTENT IllfllJiMW.

As he left his home he saw a disc-shaped craft hovering above the farm buildings. It was less than 100 feet from Stevenson, about 60 feet in diameter, 10 to 12 feet thick, and it looked metallic. In the center was a dome through which shone a blinding orange light. From the disc's tilted position, it appeared that someone inside the dome was curious about the bluish-green glow from the farrowing-house windows. After a moment, the disc moved into a level position, then it passed over another farm building and was hidden from view. Before it disappeared, the light in the dome changed to a dim amber, but Stevenson was unable to see inside. On the 18th at about 5 PM, a farmer living 14 miles west of Stockton, Kansas, was standing near the hogpen about 100 feet east of his house, when he heard the pheasants raising a disturbance and the chickens all rushed to the henhouse. He looked around toward the house to see what was causing it and saw something hovering just above the house. The farmer ran toward the house, and then the object lowered over the north end of the structure .. and settled toward the ground. When the object was about six feet from the farmer it stopped about level with his face, and just wobbled around for an instant, fire belching in and out of it. The object was about four feet long and shaped something like a funnel. Suddenly there were a lot of sparks showering from it and it took off to the northwest, leaving a trail of smoke all the way. Shortly thereafter, a large cloud of smoke appeared in the sky, followed by the sound of an explosion. The farmer checked the ground in the area where the object had been and found it to be \"hot.\" THIRTY-FIVE YEARS AGO- February 1953: At 1:50 PM a meteorological aide for the U.S. Weather Bureau in Yuma, Arizona, was searching for a lost weather balloon with the aid of a theodolite when he sighted a solid white, oblong object. The size of the object consisted of one minute of arc. The object appeared to be ascending straight up, then levelled off and at this point was joined by a second object of exactly the same description. The second object left the field of the theodolite twice but returned each time to join the original. They both disappeared simultaneously. The objects remained in vision for five minutes. The observer said that the objects rose more rapidly than any balloon he had ever seen and furthermore moved against the prevailing westerly winds. * * * THIRTY YEARS AGO-February 1958: No significant reports on file for this period. * •*• * TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO- February 1963: A strange, fast- moving UFO near Washington, DC was sighted on the 7th by Carl Chambers, a Linden, Pennsylvania pilot and photographer, and John P. Campbell, reporter for the Williamsport, Pennsylvania Sun- Gazette. The UFO, which had a yellow- white glow, was first seen from their private plane, at an altitude of 5500 feet, near Charlottsville, Virginia. At one time the object hovered off their wing, then moved rapidly under and above the aircraft. A few minutes later it was seen about 35 miles south of Washington, seemingly hovering over a defense-missile site. Half a minute after this, the witness said, it reappeared 10- 15 miles north of the capital. During the rest of the observation period, the UFO maneuvered at an estimated speed of over 2000 knots. When Chambers radioed National Airport tower, the FAA traffic controller told him that another aircraft in the vicinity radioed a similar report, confirming their description of the unknown object. On the 15th, an Australian dairy farmer named Brew observed an object about 25 feet wide that looked like a thick disc. \"It was battleship grey in color and appeared to have a band of glass or plastic around the circumference and a number of protrusions that looked like scoops.\" The incident occurred about 7 AM when the farmer and his son were milking their cows. When Brew glanced outside at the sky, he spotted an object coming down at a slow rate of speed to a height of 75 to 100 feet. \"I thought it was going to land but it suddenly shot off in a westerly direction and disappeared into a cloud.\" Although Brew's son did not see the object, he heard the pulsating, whooshing sound the disc made as it revolved overhead. The whole incident lasted only a matter of seconds, but it was long enough to send Brew's horse and herd of cows into a panic. After the incident Brew admitted that he had laughed at people who said they saw such things. Amos Biggs reported that he spotted a \"strange contraption\" hover and land on the ice on Crystal Lake near Lewiston, Montana on the 22nd. He said the object cast a brilliant, almost radiant light as it hovered over the lake and finally dropped to the ice in the black stillness of the night. Biggs said the object appeared to be silver in color, was disc-shaped on the bottom with a slight oval compartment at the top. Biggs said a door mysteriously appeared in the oval part of the object but nobody got out. The object remained on the lake for about 10 minutes, then the door closed and the object raised from the lake and disappeared into the east. He said he detected only a light buzzing from the object while it was in motion. That same night and about 100 miles to the southwest, an object described as \"a strange red ball of fire\" startled a Belgrade resident, Bill DeHann, about 2:30 AM as he was driving home from work. Telephones were reported as \"jingling\" in many Belgrade homes at the same time as the UFO was seen. Many residents were awakened at this 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"hour \"by something.\" DeHann said the \"strange red ball\" shook and swayed his car when it landed about 200 feet from the vehicle. * •*• * TWENTY YEARS AGO—February 1968: Mr. R.W.B., an executive of the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, writes about the experience he had at 2:20 AM on the 9th near Gower, Missouri: \"I heard several cows bawl as though frightened or scared. I immediately jumped from my bed and ran to the picture window in my living room. It was a dark night but there was a distinct glow giving off considerable light immediately in front of the house (approximately 300 to 350 feet away). It made sufficient light for me to maneuver around a card table left in the middle of the room, and to see cattle in the pasture in a rough semi-circle to the left of the light glow. As my vision adjusted from darkness to this moderate light, I was able to see parts of what appeared to be .a tremendous circular object. The light was a yellowish-green and came from the concave sides of the craft. I could not tell whether it came from a translucent surface or was reflected from the base of the craft against a shiny surface and then back to the ground. \"The object appeared to be at least 100 feet in diameter, and to be hovering 20 to 25 feet above the ground...There were definitely seven openings or portholes in the approximate center of the concave sides..:! -could not see distinctly enough to tell if they were square, rectangular, oval or round...! would guess that they were two feet to 30 inches in approximate diameter. I saw no door or distinct opening. I saw no .living thing enter or depart the craft. Some of the cows were staring at this object from perhaps 100 to 200 feet away. Cows with younger calves were bawling, and some of the calves were answering. Finally one cow whirled and ran, with tail high, toward the barn. The other followed and in only a few seconds there were no cattle in sight. \"The craft remained some little time after the cows departed, but I have no idea whether this was half a minute or considerably longer. All during this time there had been a distinct noise that I have difficulty in describing. It 22 sounded something like the swish of a piece of wire which one might whirl around above his head at high speed and yet it had a pulsating rhythm of some kind. When the craft departed, this noise was two or three times louder and the sound-pulsations were more rapid. The craft moved away rapidly toward the southwest, arising at about a 45-degree angle, without the craft being tilted in any way from the horizontal-position it had maintained at, or above, ground level.\" Four youths observed a stationary UFO over a pond in a former gravel pit on Vashon Island in Puget Sound, southwest of Seattle, Washington on the 18th.' Dick Frombach and Chris Beachner, both 18, were riding in a car driven by Boone Powers, 19, about 1 AM when all three saw the object. \"It was either oval or crescent-shaped and it appeared to measure about 25 feet across. It gave off a pale, bluish-white light — a glow, really,\" Frombach said. The trio studied the object from about 100 feet away and then rushed back to the community of Vashon. Powers returned to the site with another friend, Joe Furbish, 18. \"After parking the car a few hundred feet away, we walked to the pond area,\" Powers said. \"I saw immediately that the object had moved during the few minutes I had been away. When I first saw it, the object was to the right of the pond. Now it was to the left.\" To Furbish, the object appeared lens-shaped, made of shiny metal and about the size of a compact station wagon. \"The light it gave off was odd. It seemed to be relfected light rather than illumination generated by the object itself,\" Furbish said. \"But there was no lights nearby or in the sky that it could reflect. It was pitch dark and raining torrents at the time.\" Powers and Furbish drove away to find more witnesses and when 1 they returned to the pond later with a new group of people, the UFO was gone. But the pond, measuring 100 feet in diameter, was now a solid sheet of ice. Distrubed by this new mystery, Powers and Furbish reported their discovery to Deputy Sheriff Don Holke. It was 2 AM when Holke arrived. In the officer's own words, \"The Pond was frozen from bank to bank, with the ice ranging from 2 to 3 inches in thickness. While there was a soft mud everywhere else in the area, the earth was firm at the. very edges of the pond. The ice was hard and dry. Although it was raining heavily at the time — and had been for hours — no water collected on top of the ice. And all the large puddles near the pond were not frozen. The kids went out on the pond ice and jumped up and down on it, even bounced rocks on it without making a crack. It was frozen solid.\" Dave W. Akers made an on-site investigation and said the ice formed in two to five layers. It was riddled with air bubbles and grit, stirred up from the bottom, as if by boiling. The pond was checked for radiation but no abnormal levels were registered. Akers noted the temperature at the time the ice formed was 50 degrees and produced weather records showing it had been mild for the preceding six days. Twelve hours after the pond froze, two island residents, Bill Mann and Ray Smith, cut and removed sheets of ice still measuring two inches in thickness. * * * FIFTEEN YEARS AGO-February 1973: A Boeing 737 airliner of Mozambiques Deta Airline . was followed by a UFO for 20 minutes on a night flight from Beira, Rhodesia, to Lourenco Marques, Rhodesia, on the 6th. The plane was flying at a height of 8400m and a speed of 850km/h when the aircraft's veteran commander, Captain Gilberto Costa, and first pilot Edgar Nasi Pereira saw the object. They immediately called two air hostesses to the cockpit to corroborate the sighting. It switched from the right to the left side of the aircraft a few times with red lights flashing before disappearing at enormous speed. * * *. TEN YEARS AGO—February 1978: A huge UFO — about 20 meters in diameter — and an occupant, were sighted near the La Florida dam, 40kms from the city of San Luis, Argentina, by a party of fishermen. Manuel Alvarez, an employee of Aerolineas Argentines who has not recovered from his surprise, said the object looked like an upside-down soup bowl and emitted a light similar to that of fluorescent tubes. He said that it appeared suddenly, flying (continued on page 20)"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued \"MUFON 1989 UFO Symposium\" to be held in Las Vegas, Nevada on a weekend during the middle of June 1989.

Steve Pelles, an electronic engineer in Pittsburgh, will fill the position of Assistant Director. THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant FEBRUARY 1988 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): The two brightest planets in the heavens, Venus and Jupiter, gleam together in the SW. Venus, at magnitude -4.1, is the lower and brighter of the pair. It sets about 8:45 in midmonth. Jupiter, at magnitude -2.2, sets about an hour and a half after Venus. The two objects are drawing nearer to each other and will present a stunning sight early next month. The crescent Moon is near Venus on the 20th and near Jupiter on the 21st. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars and Saturn form another pair of planets in the SE morning sky, closing to within only 1.3° of each other on the 23rd. They are then in Sagittarius. Yellowish Saturn, at magnitude +0.6 in mid-February, is nearly twice the brightness of the red planet. Mars rises about 3:15 and Saturn about 15 minutes later (midmonth). The crescent Moon lies near both planets on the 13th. With binoculars, use the two planets to locate 6th-magnitude Uranus — a faint pale greenish dot slightly more than one degree below Saturn on February 13 and even closer below Mars on the 22nd and 23rd. A small telescope will reveal the 7th planet's tiny disc. Moon Phases: Full moon-February 2 Last quarter-February 10 New moon-February 17 First quarter-February 24 The Stars: o € At 9 PM the Winter Circle of bright stars is prominent in the south. Foremost of these objects, of course, is the blue-white Dog Star Sirius, which crosses the celestial meridian at this time of night in mid-February. Its only competitors in northern latitudes are the planets Venus and Jupiter setting in the west. If, however, you live in the southern U.S., 37° below Sirius lies the star Canopus, the 2nd brightest nighttime star. Leo the Lion, the spring sky symbol, has already climbed above the eastern horizon. In the NE the Big Dipper has returned to easy visibility, its curved handle trailing beneath the rectangular bowl.

Both the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) flourished during this exciting era following Kenneth Arnold's historic sighting. According to former NICAP staff officers, membership reached a high of 15,000, whereas APRO claimed 4 to 6 thousand members at its peak. Each group was dedicated to fulfilling envisioned goals and objectives established by their directors. Both organizations have invaluable investigated UFO cases within their files for this period, which must be retained for posterity. After CUFOS purchased the NICAP files, Sherman Larsen spent several years reorganizing it into a reference source. We pray that Mrs. Coral Lorenzen will have the foresight and consideration to make arrangements to preserve the APRO file for future generations. Knowing the fine work that APRO and NICAP performed during their dynasties, newcomers to UFOlogy will obviously ask \"what happened to them in the 1970s and 1980s?\" Many factors contributed to their demise, however poor management and inadequate leadership were the prime deficiencies. If MUFON is to continue to grow as the world's leading UFO membership organization, we must recognize and always be cognizant of the weaknesses and problems that befell earlier organizations. The MUFON Board of Directors is dedicated to providing the leadership, management and motivation to not only stay abreast of the current status of scientific UFOlogy, but to anticipate and plan for the future. The majority of the people who were responsible for the successful era of NICAP and APRO now serve in MUFON leadership roles. Yes...we must be doing something right. Accolades to all the wonderful people in MUFON who have made this possible, as we approach our twentieth year. * * * New leadership for our State investigative teams is acknowledged with the following assignments: Kenneth J. Ewing, M.S. in Nuclear Engineering, is the new State Section Director for Los Alamos and Santa Fe Counties in New Mexico; Richard A. Runnels has accepted the responsibility for Tulsa County in Oklahoma; and Richard P. Hacsche, Sr. is heading up New London and Windham Counties in Connecticut. Donald A. Johnson, Ph.D., State Director for Washington, is also a Consultant in Research Psychology and Quantitative Methods, and Howard J. Hoffman, J.D. joins MUFON as a Consultant in Law. * * * Budd Hopkins recently accepted our invitation to speak at the MUFON 1988 UFO Symposium to be held June 24, 25 and 26, 1988 at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. Pamela Weintraub published an outstanding article titled \"Secret Sharers\" in the December 1987 edition of OMM magazine on alien abductions based upon interviews with the most prominent researchers in this field of study. It also features a questionnaire submitted by Budd Hopkins inquiring about \"Hidden Memories: Are You An Abductee?\" Budd has already received 1200 responses to his questionnaire. MUFON's Director has agreed to read and evaluate a portion of these in order to assist Mr. Hopkins in this far reaching story. Budd is the MUFON Staff Member for Abductions. Bill Pitts and the Arkansas MUFON group, headed by Ed Mazur, State Director, have announced a Regional UFO Conference to be held the weekend of March 25 and 26, 1988 (Friday and Saturday) at the Inn of the Ozarks in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Bill has invited many of the pioneers in UFOlogy to speak so that they may share their experiences with the participants. He has provided a clue by saying \"It is going to seem like the Arnold/Ruppelt days all over again.\" Mr. Pitts proposed this UFO Conference at the Arkansas MUFON meeting in October 1987 and is now ready to make it a reality. The Eureka Springs location is a resort hotel with beatiful convention accommodations. It is located in the northwest part of Arkansas in Carroll County on highway U.S. 62, just a few miles south of the Arkansas - Missouri border. The nearest airline service is located at Joplin, Missouri, Fort Smith or Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Inn of the Ozarks will provide shuttle service from the Fayetteville Municipal Airport to Eureka Springs if a reservation and request is made. 50 rooms have been blocked for attendees. Room reservations may be obtained by calling the Inn of the Ozarks (a Best Western Motel) at (501) 253-9768. Speakers presently committed are Major Dewey Fournet (USAF Retired), Pentagon Head of the UFO investigation during the 1952 Washington, DC flap; Al Chop, Pentagon spokesman on UFOs; Max Futch, US Air Force Airman who worked with the late Captain Edward J. Ruppelt; and Curtis Fuller, Publisher of Fate Magazine. Confirmations are pending from early NICAP officers or staff members, and former Project Blue Book officers. During the first part of January, Mr. Pitts mailed announcements to all State Directors in the Central Region elaborating on the arrangements for this Historic UFO Regional Conference, so this information could be shared with their members via State Newsletters or memos. * * * Nevada - MUFON will host the (continued on page 23)"}]
