David Spencer, Deputy Director, Investigations T he database contains reports from Canada, Newfoundland, South America, and the USA. Unfortunately, there are only 10 non-USA re- ports and one report from Hawaii, which means that worldwide data cannot be analyzed. Consequently, the study of locations was restricted to the adjoining 48 United States. TYPE OF AREA Identified sites are city, town, suburban, farm, desert, lake, mountain, prairie, sea, and woods. (The distinctions between city and town are subjective.) Any one event may have included between one and three of these types. For example, an event may have begun in a city and continued as the witness traveled to a rural area. As a result, 777 site types occurred in 600 reports. Three re- ports did not identify the site. Chart 3-1 compares the percentages of site types. More sightings took place in suburban than in urban ar- eas, and more took place in areas of farms than in the suburbs — facts that are consistent with expectations. The observation that many sightings were in wooded ar- eas is not, or should nol be, a surprise. For new information, first notice that the proportion of AN type sightings are small in urban and suburban areas, compared to farms, mountains, and woods. Nearly 80 percent of the AN type sightings are outside urban areas, versus about 50 percent of all other types of sightings. This is another indication — added to oddities found in Section 2 — that there may be something different about AN type sightings. This difference may be due to an in- ability to distinguish strange anomalies or noises in urban and suburban areas. This report does not explore the characteristics of sighting types in detail, but findings such as this may help form the basis for a future study. CHART 3-1.

CONTIGUOUS U.S. SIGHTINGS (588 events) STATES, CITIES, AND REGIONS Figure 3-1 gives the number of reports by State, total- ing 588 from 46 States. Nebraska and Wisconsin do not yet have events recorded in the database. The concentration of sightings in the eastern U.S. is much larger than in the western U.S. The area east of the Mississippi River (26 States), contains only 29 percent of the land mass and about 61 percent of the population, but it produced 75 percent of the UFO reports. The northeast and north central U.S., together, have the highest number of side-by-side States with more than 10 sightings. The States — New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois — collectively represent 10 percent of the land mass, 30 percent of the 48-State population (1990 Census), and over 40 percent of the sightings. In the southeast and south central U.S., three States (Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi) are adjacent and have more than 10 events each. Having 5 percent of the land mass and 8 percent of the population, they are responsible for 21 percent of the sightings. It appears that the number of people relates to the number of sightings, but a simple linear regression (sightings and population) is a poor model for the data. Factors other than population must be signifi- cant, and one of these is surely the availability of MUFON Field Investigators who will submit reports. Some States show most sightings in regions, often near large cities and well-traveled highways. No con- clusions can be drawn from this directly, but the infor- mation might provide clues to researchers. Table 3-1 provides a summary of observations for States that have obvious tendencies for sighting localizations. Understand that the summary does not cover all sight- ings in the mentioned States.

The latitudes are from 21 to 49 degrees north, and the longitudes are from 68 to 124 degrees west. Charts 3-2 and 3-3 summarize the ranges having most activity. The bold line in each of these charts represents the percentage of all sightings. Finer lines depict percentages of CE, MA, FB, and AN types. Each data point in Chart 3-2 covers two degrees, start- ing at the value indicated. In Chart 3-3, each data point covers five degrees. Latitude The highest peaks in the latitudes of Chart 3-2 span the ranges 30-31.99 and 38-41.99 degrees north. Latitude 30 degrees north includes Gulf Breeze, FL, which explains why the peak exists, though sightings from 23 other cities (13 in Florida) and four other States (AL, MS, LA, and TX) are included. The peak at 38-41.99 degrees north represents sightings in over 75 cities of 19 States, from New Hampshire to California. A separate examination (not shown) reveals three peaks that are adjacent, forming one major peak between 39.5 and 43.5 degrees north. This peak is associated with 235 cases, June 1947 through October 1994, from 170 cities of 24 States. Longitude A major peak between 80 and 90 degrees west is shown in Chart 3-3 for longitudes. This peak is due mainly to the sightings around Gulf Breeze, FL, (70 cases in areas of 14 cities). Centroids of Activity To assess the possibility of long-term trends in the movement of sighting locations, the average latitude and longitude, weighted by the count of events, was calculated. If this centroid of activity shifted signifi- cantly between periods, the likelihood of observing a UFO may have also shifted locations. (There could be many reasons for such a shift.)

As indicated by the TOTAL column, some minor shifting has occurred, but the amounts are less than 5 percent of the ranges — too small to assess them as other than sampling variations. Comparing the CE and NCE TOTAL columns, no trends are obvious, and the maximum difference is less than 5 percent. What might be described as a potential creeping of values is observed for the MA, FB, and AN centroids. The MA centroid has shifted 5 degrees eastward and slightly northward, while the AN centroid has also shifted 5 degrees eastward, but slightly southward. The FB centroid has moved 5 percent northward and slightly westward. These amounts are small enough to ignore, but the fact that the movement of each sighting type has been in one direction may be a hint that something not accounted for is happening. The CE centroid does not exhibit unidirectional movement. Since the variations of values are small, it can be concluded that for sightings of all types, there has been no net long-range trend in shifting of sighting locations across the adjoining United States. The best estimate of the activity centroid, using data from all years, is a lati- tude of 37.9 degrees north and a longitude of 87.6 de- grees west, near Evansville, Indiana. Congruency of Sighting Types Table 3-2 exhibits similarity between the CE and non-CE type activity centroids. It should be reasonable to con- jecture that different types of sightings (AN, CE, FB, and MA) have similar values of activity centroids. The result from comparing the data for each sighting type (Table 3- 2) is a maximum difference of only 10 percent. This maximum comes from the AN centroid of activity before 1985, for which there are only five pieces of data. Since a 10 percent difference is not large enough to negate generalized observations between these distributions, the indication of similarity is assumed to be correct. The distributions for the different sighting types in Charts 3-2 and 3-3 have similar characteristics. That is, where the CE type increases or decreases in percent- age, so do the other types, with minor exceptions. Could the different sighting types have the same distribution? The centroids of activity for years before 1995 are shown in Table 3-2. As indicated by the TOTAL column, some minor shifting has occurred, but the amounts are less than 5 percent of the ranges — too small to assess them as other than sampling variations. Comparing the CE and NCE TOTAL columns, no trends are obvious, and the maximum difference is less than 5 percent. The similarity of distributions is also supported by statistical comparisons — assuming normal distribu- tions. The tests were unable to identify distribution dif- ferences between the CE and MA types or the FB and AN types. Tests run were the differences of estimated means, using the statistic, and ratio of estimated vari- ances, with the F-statistic. Both were two-sided tests with a 95 percent confidence interval (°= = 0.025). If the distributions are similar, then one effect should be that the coordinates containing the highest densities of sightings are the same for all sighting types. The results of a density check, looking at both longitude and latitude simultaneously, support the existence of this effect. From Figure 3-2, the CE and non-CE data are in rea- sonable agreement on the ordering of quadrants of the U.S. by the number of events. The northeast quadrant, which had the highest number of reports, contained 58 percent of the CEs and 50 percent of the non-CE sight- ings. The southeast quadrant has the second highest number, followed by the southwest quadrant. With these multiple supporting comparisons, it is hy- pothesized that sighting types are interrelated. (Since most ufologists already assume that sighting types are related to each other, this hypothesis should not be sur- prising.) From the statistical testing, the closest rela- tions are between the CE and MA types and the FB and AN types. With sighting types related, any area having a sight- ing of one type is likely to have one of another type. For Table 3-3. Location Statistics For Sighting Distributions.

The sec- ond event did not always happen soon after the first one, but over 50 percent took place during the same calendar year. Almost 90 percent were within five years, and 95 percent were within ten. Despite the supporting evidence, there is no proof that this hypothesis is correct. For instance, all the apparent similarities could result from not having enough ran- domness in the report sources to correctly represent the randomness of events, but, since about 350 Field Investigators contributed reports, this possibility does not seem likely. If future data lead to the same findings, proof may come about due to their preponderance. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS Type of Area AN type sightings are observed mainly outside urban ar- eas, while all other types are nearly equally observed in urban and non-urban areas. States, Cities, and Regions • More than 61 percent of the U.S. reports come from 11 States, which collectively represent 15 percent of the land mass and 38 percent of the population. • Regional concentrations of activity/reports can be seen in 14 states, many being near well-traveled high- ways and major cities. Location Coordinates • There has been no long-term trend regarding move- ment of sighting activities to other portions of the U.S., but there is a hint that the location centroids of MA, FB, and AN type sightings are slowly shifting to different locations. • Statistical studies provide significant support to the hy- pothesis that the different sighting types are related. • Wherever a sighting of one type occurred, a sighting of another type occurred within one degree latitude and longitude, for 96 percent of the events. In almost 90 percent of these cases, matching occurred in five years or less, and over 50 percent happened in the same calendar year. PREVIEW OF SECTION 4 Sky conditions, shapes, sizes, emissions, lights, multi- ples, and other aspects of viewed objects are examined. Are the types of objects changing over time? If so, what types are emerging? Is the classical flying saucer still around? By T. David Spencer MUFON Deputy Director, Investigations Multiple Sightings in Indiana On July 13, 1993, near Ligonier, Indiana, nine sight- ings were experienced by different witnesses, and all of them occurred between 2100 and 2135 hours local time. They were all investigated and reported by Bruce Engstrom and Robert Taylor. LOG # 931242J, CE-1, Cromwell, at 2100 hours, for 10 minutes. As a mother and her child were driving home, a group of bright red lights and blue lights appeared to be following them. After reaching their mobile home, the woman saw the lights hovering at between two and ten feet over the roof. At first, the lights were in a horizon- tal line about 50 feet long. They then divided into two groups and revealed shiny, oval objects supporting them. Within 10 minutes, the woman and child heard a high-pitched sound, and the objects moved away in a westerly southwest direction, going out of sight behind the trees. LOG # 931238J, CE-1, Ligonier, at 2100 hours, for 20 minutes. A woman (main witness), her mother, and two chil- dren driving home were stopped at railroad tracks for a freight train. They noticed three red-orange lights hov- ering above the tracks while the train passed. When they drove on by, curiosity made them stop and look back at the lights, which were floating but staying in one place no more than 400 feet away. The lights were about 25 feet above the road and spaced between ! 0 and 25 feet apart. They seemed to rotate as a unit, although no structure appeared to connect them. After about 10 minutes, the lights moved off west- ward, and the witnesses continued their journey. As they neared their home about 20 minutes later, they saw the same lights moving northwestwards past their house. LOG # 931239J, CE-1, Ligonier. at 2105 hours, for 20 minutes.

Leir A n eerie silence engulfed the small operating room where a surgeon stood poised to plunge a surgical knife deep into the tissues of a human foot. Perhaps history was about to be made . .. The scientific establishment has been screaming for years at ufologists to present so-called \"hard evidence.\" It seems as though some of the more vocal proponents, such as Carl Sagan, do not acknowledge the mass of ev- idence that has already been collected and presented. Perhaps it would behoove us to alter the accepted mean- ing of this terminology. However, until this can be ac- complished, science continues its demand for the hard- est of hard evidence. Perhaps the hard core scientific es- tablishment will only become believers when we hand them the consummate extraterrestrial craft complete with its alien operator. My small contribution to this en- deavor came about on the afternoon of August 19th. 1995. when I performed surgery to remove several sus- pected alien implants. SYNCHRONICITY In keeping with my continuous quest for knowledge, I was obliged to attend the \"UFO Expo West\" held in Southern California, in June of 1995. It has been my practice to attend as many of these events as possible and to report on them with my articles written in the Ventura-Santa Barbara MUFON Vortex. It was at this meeting that I came in contact with a Houston. Texas, re- searcher, Mr. Derrel Sims. I was intrigued with the work he was doing, the quality of the product produced and his plans for the future. It was at this meeting when he presented me with X-rays taken of a foot belonging to an alleged abductee. This was indeed coincidence, since my background has made me quite familiar with foot radiographs. It ap- peared that the foot in question had undergone some type of a surgical procedure involving the bone. There were objects that appeared to be stainless steel sutures. Derrel explained that no surgery had ever been per- APR1L 1996 NUMBER 336 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL p>- -r-;-''-*tf;^\\s- : .:]•:•'$« &v •;.:•:.•• VV&---V-.: --^3 n r, \" *• ^ ^ •;-«•..••- i 1 .\" '1- -.-..-•.V.- S&4-. *&•'. pff R V- rV; •*) r.tt'r:   ^ ^-v-^K^W^'^W^-''.^^ fe'- ''•-: t$&^m&^i m xmffifaam formed. This propelled my eyebrows to a considerable height. My next question, naturally mired in scientific logic, related to accidents. This was also confirmed by Derrel to be in the negative. The reason for the X-rays being taken had to do with a contiguous problem. The appearance of these films left a distinct impression on my mind, as not only was there a visible metallic foreign body on one side of the big toe, but in addition there ap- peared to be a second object on the other side. During the course of our meeting, the subject was broached as to the possibility of whether or not this in- dividual would be receptive to having these objects sur- gically removed. Derrel stated that as far as he knew, the lady would be overjoyed. He also mentioned that she had no medical insurance and that costs were an adverse factor. I pondered the situation and after careful consid- eration, I put forth an offer. If the patient could be flown to California, I would perform the surgical procedure without charge. The initial expression on Derrel's face was one to behold. He seemed to be astonished. At that point he invited me to attend his workshop and I eagerly accepted. During the course of the lecture he presented this case to the audience and explained that there was now a California doctor who would remove the objects in question. He then asked for a volunteer to pay for the transportation. Within minutes after the cessation of the lecture I was called to the podium and told by one very happy presenter that someone had just agreed to foot the entire bill. With that, he stated, he would be in touch by telephone to arrange the date and handle the details. During the next few weeks a multitude of telephone conversations took place. I was informed that a second individual with a similar foreign body, visible on x-ray, also needed surgery. I agreed to arrange for both proce- dures in the same day. Within a week I received some new radiographs of both individuals. The newest of the surgical candidates was male and the object was in his hand. Coincidentally, this entity appeared to be an exact replica of one of the objects seen in the big toe of the first surgical candidate. I presented both sets of films to a qualified radiologist. He confirmed the presence of metallic foreign bodies. Plans were then formatted for the date and time of the event. Both patients were from different parts of Texas, and would meet for the first time in Houston to make the trip to California. PREPARATION In order to accomplish this surgical procedure within the time constraints allowed, considerable preparation had to be made. The first task was to list those individuals that ] considered the most qualified and open minded. These would include both the professional and non- professional components. Next I focused on the most ap- propriate site to perform the surgery. Taking into account the number of personnel, the need for privacy, the amount of recording equipment and a myriad of other, factors, it was my decision to perform these procedures in one of my offices. The ideal location would be my Camarillo office. The surgery was scheduled for August the 19th, which happened to fall on a Saturday. This would provide a facility free of the other doctors and their staffs. Once this decision was made, I turned my at- tention to the physical materials needed. Everything necessary to performing this procedure had to be listed, collected and transported to the surgical site in a timely fashion. Instructions were given to my office staff to pre- pare the multitude of documents and ancillary paper- work necessary to the performance of these procedures. THE TEAM Next my concentration became focused on selecting the professional portion of the surgical team. With Derrel giving the hypnoanesthesia and myself as the principal surgeon, two team members had already been con- scripted. Mr. Sims is a licensed, certified hypnoanes- thesiologist and has performed in this capacity many times previously. In addition he was totally responsible for coordinating this entire effort from Houston. He has a wide and diverse background as a UFO investigator and abduction researcher. He is known worldwide for his innovative techniques. Derrel's work has been consid- ered to be on the forefront of research. PAGE 10 NUMBER 336 APRIL 1996"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The position of second surgeon was filled by a friend that I had known for many years. He is a general sur- geon and is retired. We will refer to him as Dr. A. My next choice was a Ph. D. Psychologist, Dr. Barbara Dobrin, who is an esteemed member of our local MU- FON group. I would like to interject at this point the fact that most participants were members of MUFON and this helped to solidify our effort. The remaining mem- bers of the team were in a sense the non-professional component, but these individuals all performed in a most professional fashion. Our surgical nurse was my daughter-in-law, Mrs. Denise Messina. Our video pho- tographer was Mr. Mike Evans, who holds a degree in nursing. Mike was past section director of Ventura- Santa Barbara MUFON. The entire event was under the direction of my office manager, Mrs. Janet Warnick. Her job was shared with our local MUFON state section director, Mrs. Alice Leavy. Mr. Jack Carlson and his mother Ruth were intrusted with the task of recording this event on paper. Both are professional writers. Another trusted member of the MUFON circle was Mr. Bert Clemens. Bert supplied numerous pieces of equip- ment such as a magnetometer and stud finder. He also set up the video recording equipment, including a tele- vision monitor that could be viewed in an adjoining room. This room was used for the individuals not al- lowed in the operating room. THE SURGERY Each patient was processed in a predetermined manner. A full and complete medical history was taken. Next, each patient underwent an abduction history exam and their emotional and psychological states were deter- mined. Tape recordings were made of the interviews and later transcribed. All paperwork, including consent and release forms, was signed by the patients. Charts were then compiled for each individual. All previous laboratory tests, ordered by me. were reviewed. Each pa- tient was brought to the X-ray room and new radi- ographs were taken, processed and reviewed by Dr. A. and myself. Each patient was then placed in a treat- ment room and my surgical nurse withdrew the pre- scribed amount of blood. S ince the literature contains many stories related to surgically removed implants disappearing, evapo- rating, turning to powder etc.. I decided the best trans- port media to be the patients' own bodily fluid. The isolated blood was then centrifuged and the serum por- tion separated and mixed with an anticoagulant, making an ideal transport fluid. With the initial preparation completed, our first pa- tient Patricia was brought into the operating room and positioned on the operating table. With video rolling, Derrel Sims began to initiate hypnotic induction. Next, a local anesthetic,,consisting of a mixture of a quick-act- ing with a long-acting anesthetic, was administered to Since the literature contains many stories related to surgically removed implants dis- appearing, evaporating, turning to powder etc., I decided the best transport media to be the patients' own bodily fluid. The iso- lated blood was then centrifuged and the serum portion separated and mixed with an anticoagulant, making an ideal trans- port fluid. the patient. Then the area was prepared in the usual manner and draped with sterile drapes. A small tourni- quet was applied to the great toe of the patient's left foot. An eerie silence engulfed the small operating room where the surgeon was poised to plunge a surgical knife deep into the tissues of the human foot. Perhaps history was about to be made. With the X-ray as a guide I made my initial incision on the inside of the big toe. Thus began the long and te- dious task of searching for the unknown. It took almost an hour to achieve this. I have performed this procedure many times in my thirty years of practice. Most of the time it is analogous to looking for the proverbial \"needle in the haystack.\" The first clue indicating close prox- imity to the object came about during the deep probing of the incision. Suddenly the patient almost jerked her foot off of the table. At this point 1 was a bit taken back, as the patient literally was under the influence of a double anesthesia. Derrel continued his hypnotic sug- gestions'and the patient became quiet and calm. Further probing of the same spot elicited a similar response. With this sign as a guide post, we continued dissection of this area until a small grayish object was visualized. It was then carefully clamped and excised from the sur- rounding tissues. At the moment of actual extraction, the patient responded with another small jerk and an indi- cation of pain. My thoughts at the time were centered around my past experiences performing surgery for removal of for- eign objects. The only times that I have personally wit- nessed this type of response under local anesthesia is when an object has been physically attached to a nerve. The motion of removal apparently pulls directly on the nerve fibers and this seems to evoke a direct pain re- sponse. T he ambiance of the operating room suddenly changed.

My sense of curiosity was piqued and I took a surgical blade and at- tempted to scrape a portion of the membrane from the underlying structure. To my consternation, I found that my efforts were far from productive. The harder I tried, the more impossible it became to remove the dense covering. Since I was primarily concerned with the well being of my patient, I made the decision to continue with the surgical procedure and commenced closure of the surgical wound. The first segment of the surgery was now complete and our attention was directed to the opposite side of the big toe where the second object was lodged. A careful examination of the current radiographs provided us with guidance in making the second incision. Soon our dis- section was deep within the tissues and probing for the second object began. It look a greater amount of time to locate this one due to the angle of the X-ray and the smaller size. When the object was touched, reaction occurred in the same violent manner as did the initial probing for the first object. Found and clamped, the second entity was removed and placed on a gauze sponge. This one was about the shape of a small can- taloupe seed and covered with the same dark gray, dense membrane. A futile but valid, short, attempt was made to separate it from its biological jacket. There was no suc- cess in this endeavor and I chose to immediately finish the surgical procedure. The surgical team took a brief respite before starting the second case. It was with renewed enthusiasm that found Dr. A. making a surgical incision into the back of the hand of Pat, our second surgical candidate. Pat was a rough and tumble fellow who gave the appearance of a \"Mountain Man.\" I took up the role of assistant in the procedure and performed those tasks required of me. The procedure was essentially the same as the one we had just performed. The patient winced with discomfort when the object was probed and extracted. The appear- ance of this object brought about profound astonish- ment. It looked exactly like the second entity that was re- moved from the first patient. By this time we had learned that attempts to remove the covering were futile, so this was not done. Following each surgery, the pa- tients were placed in a quiet adjoining room and re- evaluated by Dr. Dobrin, our psychologist. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS I would like to make it crystal clear to our readers that only the most preliminary findings are known at this time. It would be extremely premature to draw conclu- sions at this point. I will, however, enumerate the former. Since the findings are basically all the same for all three objects, no attempt will be made to delineate them. 1. One object (the largest), while wrapped in its very tight membrane, appeared to be triangular or star-shaped. The other two resembled small cantaloupe seeds. 2. The largest specimen measured approximately one-half cm. in each direction and the other two mea- sured approximately two to four mm. 3. The objects were tightly wrapped in a very dense, tough, gray, membrane. This substance was strong enough to prevent me from removing it from the un- derlying metal when I attempted to do so with a very sharp surgical blade. 4. After the specimens were received in Houston, the membranes were dried and removed, revealing a black, shiny metallic core. 5. Prior to removing the membranes, Derre^and a chemist, Mr. Glen Manuel, used their intuitive sense and decided to subject them to ultraviolet black light ex- amination. All three were noted to fluoresce a bright green color. This is the same color that has been seen to appear on certain areas of the skin on abductees. It was also noted that the objects appeared to be magnetic and clung to the scalpel blade. 6. The metallic portions are now undergoing a battery of examinations, including electronmicroscopy and pho- tospectrometry. No data is available at this time. 7. Tissues that were removed from an area surround- ing the objects were sent for pathological analysis and revealed the following: \"Numerous peripheral nerves and pressure receptors, no evidence of inflammation, ei- ther acute or chronic, no inflammatory cells or infiltrates, no fibrosis.\" This is not the usual finding in foreign body tissue reactions. 8. Next a small portion of the membrane was sent in independently. The results were as follows. \"Proteinaceous Coagulum [made from blood protein], Keratin [the most superficial layer of the skin and the substance that makes the outer structures of the body, such as hair and nails].'' The only conclusions that can safely be drawn at this time is that the findings so far are of an unusual na- ture and it would be foolish to conjecture about them.

In North America alone there are probably well over 300,000 newspaper stories! You may think, \"Surely you jest! Hardly anything about UFOs is published in my own local newspaper.\" However, this number could easily be attained if each newspaper in North America had published only two UFO items a year for the last fifty years. So 300,000 sto- ries are not unthinkable, indeed, I would contend such a figure probably errs on the conservative side, if it errs at all. Of course, some newspapers publish no stories for years, and certain localities may produce few UFO in- cidents. Even allowing for differences in areas and times with few reports, there are huge amounts of untapped data. It should be made clear that local data are being discussed. When wire service stories are added, the to- tal published material swells dramatically. Sometimes even wire service stories are carried only in a few re- gional newspapers close to the event. (In July 1947, the Fairbanks, Alaska News-Miner reported on an earlier UFO sighting in April. Apparently this story made it to the United Press wire service as a small upstate New York newspaper also carried the story. However, out of over 2800 North American .newspapers checked for PROJECT 1947 no other newspaper carried the story.) The experience of PROJECT 1947 tends to confirm the estimate of huge numbers of untapped local stories. Where newspapers are well indexed or have well main- tained UFO clipping files, there are large numbers of re- ports. However, even in British Columbia, where the Victoria and Vancouver newspapers are well indexed. I was able to supplement the indexed UFO reports after just a short search. A wealth of new material awaits further research. PROJECT 1947 was founded to find this \"new\" ma- terial. Carrying on the early work of Ted Bloecher, whose research found over 850 reports from 1947, PRO- JECT 1947 is a modest attempt to expand on the foun- dation that Bloecher laid down when he wrote Report of the UFO Wave of J947. Not content with this research, Bloecher continued work on 1947-1953 and turned up hundreds of new reports, filling in many gaps. ENCOUNTER OVER KINGMAN Searching newspapers that Bloecher did not check con- tinues to bring interesting 1947 reports to light. For ex- ample: at about 10 p.m.. 7 July 1947, near Kingman, Arizona. Charles Ely, co-owner of the Western Auto Store and Frank Marbel, a flight instructor, prepared to land the Piper Super Cruiser they were flying. Two bright lights approached them at the Piper's altitude of 600 feet from the north end of the Hualpai Mountains. Ely blinked his landing lights twice to notify what he thought was an oncoming aircraft that he was landing. He received no answer; so again he blinked his lights. Again, there was no answer. About this time the fliers estimated that the lights were about 500-600 feet away and about 20 feet apart. After receiving no answer, Ely banked the aircraft to get out of the way. Markel watched the two lights sepa- rate and in a few moments rejoin each other over Kingman and continue their westward flight. The lights looked the same going away as they did when they ap- proached. The lights cast no beam. On the ground the air- port operation personnel said they heard only the aircraft that Ely and Marbel were flying. Ely told the newspaper reporter who took the story that he did not drink. 1 UNIQUE MANEUVERS William T. Powers warned us in 1966 to consider care- fully how we encode data for computers. He was con- cerned that unique items which had no data reduction code would be lost in the computerization process. 2 Two such reports can be found during 1947, one in California and the other in Washington. Both tell of disc-shaped objects following one another horizontally in a line as if attached by a string and moving on an os- cillatory flight path. They had another unusual feature in that the first object in the pattern would would flip over like a coin and then each object in the pattern would also perform the maneuver in turn. The California sighting based on the witnesses' written account was briefly summarized in the CUFOS Associate Newsletter years ago, while the Washington sighting was mentioned in a small article in a 1947 weekly Washington newspaper. At first I suspected balloon trains as an answer to these sightings. While not yet confirmed, I believed there was a weather research project conducted in the summer of 1947. The press has many reports of ra- diosondes and deflated weather balloons coming down all over the US and Canada, especially in the Northeast and Missouri. Meteorological research programs have successfully mobilized meteorological assets from the active duty military, Reserves, National Guard, and col- leges and research institutions. During a 1970s tor- nado research project, over 90 mobile balloon launch- ing/tracking crews were fielded. In 1947, balloon trains APRIL 1996 NUMBER 336 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The objects, which were in view for two minutes, were V-shaped with a circular body and a belly-like protuberance under the nose of the V.

Also, balloon vendors in a Portland park were launching children's balloons tied together in a line. However, it seems unlikely that balloons would behave in the manner described above. T wo other cases bear some slight resemblance to the \"flipping coin\" cases. The Monon Railroad case in Central Indiana of 3 October 1958, had objects that seemed to move in a coordinated motion sometimes with the objects flying on edge 3 . A forest ranger on lookout duty at Mt. Josephine, Skagit County. Washington on 17 August 1947, saw a disc-shaped ob- ject appear to drop straight out of the sky to the north- east. It came down at a lipped angle, but as it approached its final altitude the angle of the tip diminished. When it reached its final altitude, it completely righted itself and seemed to float leisurely about as if \"suspended on a cord\" for several moments. Suddenly, it started away to the southeast and disappeared at a great rate of speed. 4 The origin of this last report is very interesting. It comes from a letter to Project Blue Book in July 1952. The letter was filed in a catch-all file entitled \"Public Response to the April 1952 LIFE Magazine article.\" This file was later microfilmed and during some house- cleaning about the time of the Condon Committee LTC Quintanilla, Project Blue Book head, was about to throw it out along with about 30 other rolls of microfilm con- taining UFO newspaper clippings from 1952. Luckily, Dr. Herbert J. Strenz, who at the time was working on his dissertation in journalism, received these microfilm files instead of the trash can, and these files were saved and later handed over to Barry Greenwood of CAUS. The \"LIFE file\" contains hundreds of letters on various subjects. Many letters reported UFOs. These reports were not counted as Blue Book case files. Few reports for 1947 have yet been found in Europe. The London and Paris newspapers generally gave only short accounts of sightings and ridiculed UFOs as an American phenomenon. Capt. Norman E. Waugh, pilot for Airwork, Ltd. of London, was ferrying a plane to Argentina when the crew saw a grayish object which looked like a tadpole. The sighting took place over the Bay of Biscay at 10 o'clock GMT. The plane was flying above the clouds at 8,000 feet while the object appeared to be at 16,000 feet at a distance of five or six miles. Capt. Norman had 16 years of flying experience and ser- vice in Bomber Command and Transport Command during the war. First Officer Peter Roberts, a Squadron Leader during the war, and Radio Officer S. J. R. Chineck also witnessed the UFO. 5 REPORTS FROM OTHER PERIODS An experienced pilot and airport operator was flying near Mountain Home, Idaho at 12:05 p. m. on 24 July 1949, when seven weird V-shaped objects about 1500 feet under him overtook his aircraft and continued on a easterly course at tremendous speed. The objects, which were in view for two minutes, were V-shaped with a cir- cular body and a belly-like protuberance under the nose of the V. They did not bank or tilt when they turned. There were no markings. The objects' color was neither white nor gray, but a shade the pilot had never seen be- fore. The circular portion toward the nose of the V seemed to change color. There was no indication of pi- lots in the objects. The objects flew in two lines of three with the seventh object between the two lines or above them. There was no evidence of propulsion or exhaust. The Air Force flight center at McCord Field had no record of any mil- itary flights authorized in the area. The Mountain Home Air Base had no experimental aircraft. h An early close encounter in August or September 1939, was recalled by a Forth Worth, Texas woman. She was sleeping on a bed in her back yard on a night with the moon shining. She heard a whirring noise \"like an electric fan\" coming from the east. As she raised up on her.elbow to look, a strange object came directly toward her from a height of about 20 or 30 feet. The ob- ject slowed and descended to a height even with her bed. It appeared to be three feet long by one foot high, gray- ish in color, and with strata or veins appearing to run through it. It was shaped like an old time Mississippi steam boat. Surrounding it was a soft blue-green glow. It moved toward the foot of her bed, then suddenly zoomed into the sky and disappeared. 7 FILLING IN THE GAPS PROJECT 1947, a two-and-a-half-year research pro- ject into the 1947 UFO wave, continues to turn up hun- dreds of reports from 1947. Soon after beginning the project, it became evident that there was a huge amount of material in other eras, too, such as World War I, 8 1950, 1956, 1957, etc. So part of the effort became to fill in the gaps in these other eras. Screening newspapers continues to be the biggest source of reports. I have also found UFO files in libraries, universities, and his- torical societies. Hundreds of people have contributed copies from their files, scrapbooks, personal reports, or research in their local area.

If MUFON members did a few hours of searching in their local areas the results would dwarf ef- forts to date. Many people do not have the tempera- ment, nor time, to sit in front of a microfilm reader or bound copies of old newspapers looking for UFO sto- ries. However, there are other routes. Many newspa- pers still have clipping files which are open to the pub- lic. However, their number is decreasing, as many news- papers now charge the public to use their \"morgue\" hies. Some libraries, historical societies and universities have \"vertical files\" on subjects that interest the public, or they may have indexed local newspapers. Sometimes you will find UFO reports indexed or filed under other headings besides \"Flying Saucers,\" \"UFOs,\" or \"Unidentified Flying Objects.'' All the following head- ings have worked in one place or another: Aeronautics, Airships, Astronomy, Ball-Lightning, Balloons, Crackpot, Extraterrestial Life, Fireballs, Ghost Lights, Hallucinations & Illusions, Jack-o-Laterns, Lights, Meteors. Mysterious Lights. Phantasms, Phantom Airships, Phenomena, Space and Spook Lights. Local historical societies are one of the least ex- ploited resources in UFO research, but many times they will have reports, too, especially before 1947. Many communities had local scientific or philosophical soci- eties in the late 19th or early 20th century which pub- lished papers. It is possible to find accounts of strange meteors or other aerial phenomena in these publica- tions. Many times the librarian or archivist is the best re- source and in many cases I have received invaluable as- sistance. Many librarians wanted some of my research in their local areas for the library's own files. If you have friends interested in genealogy, you might ask them to be on the look out for strange sky phenom- ena when they do their newspaper or local history re- search. I would be most happy to hear from people who would like to assist PROJECT 1947 or help fill in the gaps. Reports, newspaper clippings, and scrapbooks are most welcome. Foreign language translation is always needed. Research in local areas is most welcome as well. You can write to me at PROJECT 1947, P.O. Box 391, Canterbury, CT 06331, or telephone (203) 546- 9135.

APRIL 1996 NUMBER 336 PAGE I 5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL AMERICA WEST AIRLINE CASE Airliner crew spots huge cigar-shaped UFO; NORAD apparently picks it up on radar. by Richard Hall INTRODUCTION This report is digested by Richard Hall from an investi- gation report by Walter N. Webb, UFO Consulting Services, Westwood, Mass., prepared on behalf of the UFO Research Coalition. The members of the Coalition are the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). Mr. Webb's investigation is continuing, and his report to the Coalition is an \"Interim Report.\" However, substantial progress has been made in the in- vestigation, and we felt that it was important to make these preliminary findings public. The Paramount program \"Sightings\" aired a segment about the case on November 4, 1995, but the witnesses names were not released to the program staff. Several of the key witnesses agreed to talk with Mr. Webb on a confidential basis. Because of their request for anonymity, their names cannot be published at this time. About two weeks after the sighting, an air traffic controller left a message on the CUFOS line, reporting an apparent radar-visual sighting. The investigation was assigned to Mr. Webb by the Coalition and, with coop- eration of the three groups, witnesses gradually were lo- cated and interviewed. THE ORIGINAL REPORT At 10:30 p.m. (MDT) an air traffic controller in the Albuquerque. N.M., region had just come on duty when a UFO sighting was in progress. The co-pilot of an America West flight flying over Tucumcari, N.M. (lo- cation later changed) was reporting a huge unknown object below the plane at 30,000 ft. The shape of the UFO became visible when it was illuminated by light- ning flashes in a nearby thunderstorm. While Albuquerque was unable to pick up the object on radar, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was contacted by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic controller and a NORAD spokesperson asserted that they had an unidentified radar target in the area that alternated be- tween being stationary and moving rapidly. THE SIGHTING Using information from voice tapes of the FAA air traf- fic controllers made during the sighting, telephone in- terviews with three air crew members and three Air Route Traffic Control Center personnel, a questionnaire filled out by the co-pilot, and the latter's mapped posi- tions, Mr. Webb reconstructed the sighting. Most times are converted to Mountain Daylight Time (MDT). The flight departed Tampa, Florida, on the evening of Thursday, May 25, 1995, on a nonstop flight to Las Vegas. The Captain, a veteran of 33 years, was at the controls in the left scat.. The First Officer, with 15 years experience, handled the communications in the right seat. The lead flight attendant was also in the cockpit. About two-thirds of the way through the 4-1/2 hour flight the airliner was crossing the Texas panhandle to- ward the New Mexico border at 39,000 feet, travelling about 400-450 knots (460-520 m.p.h.). A stratus un- dercast about 8,000 feet below was obscuring the ground. Off to the right (North) was an active, isolated thunderstorm cell which towered to about 40,000 feet.' Overhead the sky was clear and starry. T he flight attendant was sitting in the jump seat be- hind the co-pilot. He glanced out the right window over the co-pilot's shoulder and saw something flashing. \"John, what's that?,\" he asked the co-pilot. The First Officer turned and observed a row of flashing lights to the left (West) of the thunderclouds at a lower altitude, estimated at 30,000 to 35.000 feet. He described it as ap- pearing like \"eight strobes in a line ... as bright as land- ing lights.\" Each was \"bright white with a tint of blue.\" The two outermost lights, one on each end, flashed on and off continuously but at a slower rate than aircraft strobes, while the six others went on and off sequentially from left to right. This sequential pattern was repeated throughout the observation. The flight attendant described it somewhat differ- ently. To him the left-most light started the sequence by flashing, then going out. As it did, something like \"a beam of light or a series of smaller lights or a reflection\" traveled to the right where the outer light then flashed on. The pilot, who had to rise out of his seat to look past the others, recalled seeing two intensely bright lights, one on each end, with smaller or less intense white lights in between. However, he did not report flashing of the lights. He did report a hard-to-describe left-to-right sequencing (perhaps involving a subtle dimming and brightening). Within about 10 seconds of the initial sighting, the co- pilot contacted the Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center to inquire about the object. He reported \"some strobes\" at the three o'clock position and asked what it was and whether they had it on radar. The con- troller's response was negative to both questions. \"The PAGE 16 NUMBER 336 APRIL 1996"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL So far the Captain had only caught a glimpse of the object, but the others urged him to take a closer look. He got out of his seat and caught \"two good looks\" through the right window. He confirmed the dark silhouette, slightly curved above and be- low the lights. He thought it was closer and perhaps 400-500 feet long. length is unbelievable,\" the co-pilot exclaimed. The controller immediately contacted Cannon AFB, Clovis, N.M., to report the sighting and check on any military activity in the nearby military operations area. The reply was that there were no operations currently in progress. (As it turned out later, neither the aircraft nor the UFO was near the restricted test area.) A s the airliner continued westward, the UFO gradu- ally fell behind until it appeared in front of the towering thundercloud. Frequent lightning discharges within the cell behind the object revealed that the lights were situated along a wingless, \"cigar-shaped\" silhouette estimated by the co-pilot to be about 300-400 feet long. The storm cell was about 45 miles distant, and the UFO perhaps halfway between their airplane and the storm. So far the Captain had only caught a glimpse of the object, but the others urged him to take a closer look. He got out of his seat and caught \"two good looks\" through the right window. He confirmed the dark silhouette, slightly curved above and below the lights. He thought it was closer and perhaps 400-500 feet long. The air traffic controllers, meanwhile, called the Albuquerque Flight Service to inquire about weather balloons, which carry lights at night. No balloons were aloft at the time. Albuquerque Center also received queries from several other airline pilots in the area who overheard the radio communications, but none of them reported seeing anything. The Center asked a military aircraft, identified as \"Hawk 85,\" flying eastbound at 27,000 feet, to look for the object to his left. The pilot replied: \"We got somethin' about a little lower than us off our left wing,\" but he never reported any details. THE NORAD RADAR TRACKS About 10:45 p.m. one of the air traffic controllers de- cided to contact NORAD to see if its sophisticated radar net had tracked the unknown. The spokesperson at first didn't take the report seriously. The controller said: [THE PILOT] SAID IT WAS A PRETTY INTERESTING THING OUT THERE... IT'S RIGHT OUT OF 'THE X-FlLES.' I MEAN IT'S A DEFINITE UFO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. The NORAD spokesperson replied: AND IT'S, OH, Y'ALL ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. NORAD agreed to monitor the area. At 11:02 p.m. the NORAD spokesperson called back and reported that they had an unidentified radar track in the general region of the sighting. It was a \"search only\" (non- transponding) target traveling at about 390 knots (450 m.p.h.). At 11:08 p.m. a second controller called NO- RAD again and was told that the target had been iden- tified finally by its transponder code as a specific air- craft, and gave its current position. Mr. Webb plotted the positions and reported that all indications pointed to an aircraft. Early next morning the first controller made one final call to NORAD to learn if anything more had been dis- covered on radar. The same spokesperson answered again, and said that another target had been tracked on system radar in the same general region, and its odd be- havior was definitely unexplained. This apparently hap- pened soon after the transponding aircraft had been identified. The \"Unknown Track\" appeared stationary at first, then accelerated in a sudden burst of speed for 20 to 30 seconds before coming to an abrupt stop. It hov- ered for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, then accelerated again in an- other sudden burst of speed. This was repeated several times over a period of about 4 minutes, after which the target disappeared. The accelerations were computed to be between 1,000 and 1,400 m.p.h.! AFTERMATH Walter Webb has investigated possible prosaic explana- tions for the sighting, including making contacts with Air Force bases concerning aerial refueling operations and a study of weather records. He has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for key information, and some sighting report forms, sketches, and maps from wit- nesses are still pending. Thus, this is a preliminary re- port. His tentative conclusion is: BASED UPON ALL THE INFORMATION RECEIVED TO DATE, I BELIEVE THE AMERICA WEST SIGHTING SHOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A GENUINE UNKNOWN. Editorial Note: The investigation continues, and it is hoped that the witnesses ultimately will agree to testify publicly about their experience, perhaps in the context of a Congressional hearing.—Richard Hall.

When he checked on the sound, he saw a dark-gray, cigar-shaped object with bright red lights on either end slowly drifting westward. The object rose from near ground level to 50-70 feet, turned, then drifted north- ward. It passed through some trees and out of sight. After the incident, the witness felt dizzy and developed a rash. Being an owner of a small airport and a previously li- censed pilot, the witness gave a confident estimate from his viewpoint at 600 feet away that the object was about 280 feet long and 25 feet thick.

A slight relative move- ment was noted. Mi^cMing the lights were indepen- dent of each othei No .sound could be distinguished through the open windows, but the truck's radio was on. The lights passed behind trees and out of view. Minutes later, at home, the family watched two other lights, which tunned out to be rotating beacons on the underside of two helicopters moving in the same direction as the earlier lights. This case could possibly be an identified flying object (IFO) — helicopters — but the coincidence with the other cases was thought to be too unusual to make the IFO classification.

As the lights left, the flashing stopped. Driving on, they briefly saw the lights moving behind trees. LOG # 931244J, MA-1, Ligonier, at 2130 hours, for two minutes. As a farmer left his barn, he saw \"a lot of big, bright, dark cherry red, slow pulsating lights\" coming from the south. At first, he thought there might be an airplane crashing, until he saw the lights turn westward and con- tinue until he could no longer see them. He believed each light was at least two feet in diameter and that the pair was attached to a single structure about 50 feet wide, or more. They were at an altitude of less than 500 feet and more than one mile away from him. LOG # 931241J, CE-1, Ligonier, at 2130 hours, for 30 minutes. A woman driving homeward, southeast on Route 33, saw two red rectangular lights which were flashing at tree level. The flashing was at different rates and alter- nating between the lights. Separated by 10 feet, the lights were horizontal at first, but changed to vertical be- fore the sighting was over. At home, the woman had her husband watch as the lights drifted away to the north- west. LOG # 941245J, CE-1, Cromwell, at 2135 hours, for 20 seconds. Three teenagers traveling southward on Route 5 no- ticed several bright red lights beyond the trees. Three quarters of a mile later, two objects having a red light each passed less than 50 feet over their car. The objects had a length of between 11 and 30 feet, were separated by 50 feet, and were moving rapidly beyond the trees, going from the southeast to the northwest. Out of fear, one witness screamed during the fly over. LOG # 950326C, CE-1, 9/17/94, Memphis, TN, at 2345 hours, for one minute. Investigators: Robert McDowell and Webb Northern. It was a clear, warm evening^ and a teenage boy was driving southward on Old Germantown Road, going home from a friend's house with his car window down to enjoy the breeze. Approaching a stop sign at the in- tersection with Shelby Drive, he saw a light in an empty lot about 100 yards in front and to the left of him. Concerned that it might be a fire, he studied the light while he was stopped li \\\\.is a wooded area, and the ground was lit with a bn^ln pink glow from a light that was only a few feet orf the ^lound. He had never before seen a fire of this colui. PAGE 18 NUMBER 336 APRIL 1996"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The light rose above the tops of the 25 to 30-foot-tall trees, and he had a clear view of a circular object. If a disc, it was standing on its edge. The very center was dark, and the remainder had a glow like a neon light, the glow possibly being a reflection from six brighter, evenly spaced lights around the edge. The object was \"the size of three cars together.\" While the object continued to rise and move off southeastward at a slow rate, a car driving East on Shelby Drive stopped to view it. The driver of that car looked at the teenager, but the two did not speak. The young man then continued his journey home. LOG # 950523C, MA-1, 8/24/94, Gushing, OK, at 2250 hours, for 90 minutes. Investigators: Rick Gardner and Richard Seifried. At the nurses' station reading patient charts, a nurse was called outside by another nurse to see a UFO. In the south, she saw a light in the sky that was pulsating blue and white, occasionally showing red, and moving at a slow and steady rate toward the southwest. The light suddenly jumped straight up and back to its original position, then made four oval loops and stopped. She watched for about 30 minutes, went inside to get a cord- less phone and call a friend, then returned and watched for another 45 minutes. She went back into the hospital to take care of a few chores, then returned outside and found that the light had moved farther southwest and soon was out of sight. Another light with similar blink- ing was seen later in the west, and it appeared to go through the same maneuvers as the first. Although these object descriptions are much like those for airplanes viewed at a distance, the maneuvers are not satisfactorily explained by either autokinesis or atmospheric conditions. LOG #912204W, MA-1, 4/22/91, Ahwahnee, CA, at 2030 hours, for 20 seconds. Investigator: Randall Linlejohn. A man watched as a strange object ascended from be- hind a mountain, hovered over its top for a few seconds, then descended across the face of the mountain, which was less than a mile from him. The object had a faded, pink light randomly flashing on top, six or seven white lights across its center, and a \"bluish\" light on the bot- tom. He could not see the object's surface, but the posi- tions of the lights suggested a disc shape. Having training as a photographer, the man ran to get his camera. When he returned, the object was not visible. LOG # 950401S, CE-1, 4/77/91, Oceanside, CA, at 2000-2200 hours, for one minute. Investigator: Steve Ryan. A man standing on his porch heard what sounded like the hum from a generator coming from his back yard. When he checked on the sound, he saw a dark-gray, cigar-shaped object with bright red lights on either end slowly drifting westward. The object rose from near ground level to 50-70 feet, turned, then drifted northward. It passed through some trees and out of sight After the incident, the witness felt dizzy and developed a rash. During the first week and the same month as LOG# 912204W, a woman and her adult daughter were outside on the back patio of their home talking, on a very dark night. Suddenly, they saw a large object 60-90 feet above the north edge of their yard, which was only 50 feet away. It was as if the object had just appeared there, although it may have come over the house and over their heads, preventing them from seeing it earlier. Looking at the bottom, the vehicle was elliptical, with 30 or more circular, pulsating green and blue lights around the bottom edge. They believed it had to be about 150 feet long. The side was not visible, suggesting that it was either thin or the side was dark enough to blend with the night sky. Just as quickly as it showed itself, it disappeared \"the lights just turned off,\" and the night wns .igjin pitch black. Lellcrs to Mufon UFO journal QUAKE LIGHT? When I read Jerry Rolwes' article, \"The Mystery of Aviano\" (Feb, 1996), I suddenly realized that July 1, 1977, was about the time of the Friuli earthquakes. Checking the record, 1 found that the devastating Fniili (Italy) earthquake, M 6.5, occurred on May 6, 1976. A major (M 5.5) aftershock occurred Sept. 11, 1976. Aftershocks were still occurring a year later, and one that was felt in NE Italy and NW Yugoslavia occurred on July 3, 1977, just two days after the Aviano sighting. Given the proximity of the air base and the earth- quakes, the nearly continuous strain release, and the nature of the sighting, I think it highly likely that this was a spectacular geophysical luminosity that one could easily call an earthquake light. The account indicates that this was clearly an electrical phenomenon, most likely an intense plasma similar to ball lightning, but generated by strain release in the earth.

Please accept my thanks for adding this interesting event to the data base of probable earthquake lights. —John S. Derr, Chief Global Seismograph Network U.S. Dept. of the Interior Albuquerque, NM NOVA'S NEGATIVES Peter McGee Director of Broadcasting NOVA 125 Western Ave. Boston, MA 02134 Dear Mr. McGee: I watched with initial interest and then, ultimate dis- may, the PBS TV show \"Kidnapped by Aliens?\" It be- gan as a genuine study of credible people who have experienced this phenomena and ended as a hatchet job performed by that most inept of celestial surgeons, Carl Sagan. His \"I have not seen one, therefore they do not exist\" approach is totally unscientific and bespeaks NOVA's poor judgment in the selection of qualified sci- entists to address this subject. The carefully staged pro- gram to commence with some relevant and thoughtful experiences and then permit the well planned demolition of this information indicates that there was never an intent to apply true scientific principles to this extraor- dinary matter. The only intent was to destroy the credi- bility of Dr. John Mack, a Pulitzer prize winner and noted psychiatrist, and that of Budd Hopkins, an author and sculptor, who has dedicated a significant portion of his life to carefully evaluating these situations. Perhaps you should have Carl Sagan do a program on one of his astronomical hypotheses and we could then have Dr. Mack and Budd Hopkins analyze and dissect his data. I believe they should be as qualified to speak in this area as Carl Sagan is to speak to the UFO abduction matter. Your approach to these extraordinary matters is rem- iniscent of 15th and 16th century \"politically correct\" science. You would have burned Galileo and others at the stake for their astronomical blasphemy. The true scientist looks at all matters objectively. He weighs the data provided by the minds who have dedi- cated their efforts in a rational approach to the determi- nation of the facts. He does not allow personal bias or that which is popular to influence his analysis. He is, as with every good scientist, capable of realizing that he does not have all of the essential knowledge of the world in his tiny little brain. If he is a great astronomer he does not render expert judgment on the work of brain surgeons. As an engineer with forty years' experience, three sig- nificant patents, and the successful development of two successful companies which manufacture composite materials, and the ability to look with awe and interest at the things I do not know, I expect those who purport to be authorities in a given field to be open-minded when looking at areas outside their expertise. New ideas are born of the challenge \"we never looked at it that way be- fore.\"       •> NOVA, get your act together and be what you are supposed to be: a forum for the presentation of scientific information in a thoughtful format for the lay-person and the expert to both enjoy and contemplate. —Keith Hutson MUFON State Section Dir. Seguin, TX SCI-FI AUTOPSY Recently, while watching a past episode of a British sci-fi film made back in the early 1970s, I was sur- prised to see (for only about twenty seconds) a female lying on her back on a gurney with totally white eyes. A white-coat-clad doctor approached from her left side and, using tweezers, first gently tapped on the front of the eyeball and then removed the left eye cover (opaque white scleral lens) to expose the normal human eye structure beneath it. The young woman looked around in several directions and the scene ended. She was wearing a type of surgical gown, as was the \"doctor.\" The right eye-covering was not removed. Does any of this sound familiar? Needless to say, I found too many correla- tions with the alleged alien autopsy (AAA) film which has been a focus of much attention recently. I must ask, which of the two came first? This Gerry Anderson Production used \"Century 21 Props.\" According to the opening credits its Asst. Dir. was Leo Eaton; Editor, Alan Killick; Stunt Arranger, Jack Silk; Make-up, Cliff Sharp; Wardrobe, Kim Martin and Iris Richens. While I couldn't find the episode's ti- tle (unavoidably cut-off), it was made at \"MGM British Studios, Borehamwood, England and Century 21 Studios, Slough, England and on location.\" It was pro- duced by ITC Entertainment. Perhaps someone in the United Kingdom can do some research here. And per- haps someone who helped make this UFO-related sci-fi segment will come forward to tell us that he or she also worked on a far more realistic but later portrayal! —Richard F.

After that, the dazzling planet begins to drop low- er in the NW, reducing its setting time from about 11:30 ear- ly in May to about 9:30 at month's end. In a telescope throughout the month, watch the planet's disc c.xpand to nearly one minute of arc as its shape narrows to a crescent. (It is approaching Earth as it swings around the Sun.) Jupiter (-2.5), in Sagittarius, rises before midnight in the ESE in mid-May. This biggest of worlds begins retrograde (westward) motion on the 4th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (1.3), in Aries, reappears in the morning twilight in late May an hour before sunrise. It will be difficult to see low in the ENE. Jupiter lies S at dawn. It is near the Moon on May 8. Saturn (1.0), in Pisces, rises in the E about 3:30 AM in mid-May. The planet with rings lies near the Moon on the 13th. Vesta: The only asteroid that can be seen with the naked eye has an especially favorable appearance this month. Vesta shines at 5.6 magnitude on the J 1th but is visible with good vision and a very dark sky most of May. (Binoculars afford a bet- ter view.) It can be watched from night to night as it changes position against the stars. Residing with thou- sands of other rocky chunks in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter, Vesta is a highly reflective object 335 miles in di- ameter. On the 11 th its position is at R. A. 15h 13m, Dec. -6°44' (nearly 3° N of 2nd-magnitudc Beta in Libra). Comet Hyakutake: Discovered January 31 by Japan's Yuji Hyakutake, this po- tentially bright comet was expected to put on quite a show for northern observers in late March as it passed within a relatively close 9 million miles of Earth. Since optimistic predictions after discovery arrived too late for this col- umn (written in advance), it is hoped that readers heard about the comet and were able to view it. In May Hyakutake is visible only in the Southern Hemisphere. However, an equally spectacular comet, Hale-Bopp, looms on the horizon for next spring.

SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS COVER DESIGN CONTEST The theme for the MUFON 1996 International UFO Symposium is \"UFOLOGY: A Scientific Enigma.\" We endeavor to depict this theme in the cover artwork. Obviously, this requires considerable ingenuity and something unique in design. The 8 1/2\" x 11\" size will be printed in black on a light pastel color leatherette stock. Since small and intricate details do not print well on a leatherette stock, please take this into consideration in your design. The winning design may also be used on the symposium program in Greensboro, NC. The dead- line for submission is April 15, 1996. The winner will receive an honorarium of $100 cash plus $100 worth of MUFON publications of your choice. Here is an op- portunity to express your talent. Good luck. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAMS Anyone who has purchased and studied the 4th edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eligible to take the exam via mail when they feel they are ready. The 100-question test may be secured from MUFON head- quarters in Seguin and returned to this office for grading. In localities where field investigator training classes are being conducted, the instructor may order sufficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the completion of the training classes. For current mem- bers, the new manual may be purchased for $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling from MUFON in Seguin. MUFON MOTTO CONTEST Believe it or not, MUFON is now in its twenty-seventh year and does not have a motto describing our goals and purpose. Yes, we are endeavoring to resolve the UFO phenomenon in a scientific manner, but we need a serious and \"catchy\" motto to use in the Journal, sta- tionery, symposium programs, etc. It should be short, but yet very meaningful, such as \"Scientific Resolution of the UFO Phenomenon.\" A prize of $100 in MUFON publi- cations will be awarded to the winner. The deadline for submission of your motto is June 1, 1996. Put on your \"thinking-cap\" and come up with a unique and exciting motto for MUFON. (MUFON could also be used in the motto if this would make it more attractive.) RENEWAL NOTICE Some members have not been renewing their member- ships until they receive the notification marked \"Your membership/subscription expires with this issue.\" In a few cases this renewal was not received in Seguin before the next monthly issue was mailed, thus they missed an issue. We notify members one or two months in ad- vance by checking \"Your membership/subscription ex- pires within two months. Please renew now to avoid missing a single issue.\" It is advisable to renew when you receive this reminder. This is a more serious problem for foreign subscribers when it takes up to two months for surface mail delivery in some countries. By the time that their airmail re- newal is received in Seguin, Texas, their subscription may have expired. It is therefore imperative that foreign subscribers renew upon receipt of the first renewal no- tice in order to maintain continuity of their monthly magazines. The address label on your Journal or the envelope, in the case of foreign members, has an expiration date at the lower right corner. It is the year and month when your last monthly Journal will be honored if you forget to renew. As an example: 96/04 means that your expi- ration date and the last issue you will receive is April 1996. Foreign subscribers, in particular, have an op- portunity to renew in sufficient time by noting this ex- piration date on the envelope address label, taking into consideration the excessive time for surface delivery. We do not want anyone to miss a single issue of the MU- FON UFO Journal.
