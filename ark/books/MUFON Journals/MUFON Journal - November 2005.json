The Horrible Truth at the Heart of the Roswell Story. ' In a word, some \"whistle-blowers\" revealed to him that behind the \"leg- end\" of the Roswell UFO crash was hidden a real story of ex- periments on Japa- nese handicapped prisoners-so hor- rible that they had to remain hidden at all costs. The curious title of this book will be explained later. This new story, as strange as it looks, demands careful examination, given the notoriety of the author, who has writ- ten several good books on UFOs, in- cluding one on UFO crashes, Cosmic Crashes. The incredible story of the UFOs That Fell to Earth (7999). 2 He has also produced many articles and conferences. Another comparatively recent expla- nation for the Roswell crash is that the debris was that of a Mogol balloon. Both theories cannot be true. Not surprisingly, a major promoter of the Mogul explanation, Karl Pflock, has already expressed strong disagree- ment-with his usual wit-in an open let- ter entitled \"Attack of the Mutant Mon- goloids!\" I am going to plead here that these theories are both wrong, and that, con- sequently, the hypothesis of a UFO crash, near Roswell, in 1947, still holds. Roswell: a brief background On July 8, 1947, the base support- ing atomic bombers at Roswell, NM, issued a press release announcing the recovery of a \"flying disk\" in the area. But this spectacular discovery, in the midst of a wave of observations of these November 2005 Gildas Bourdais mysterious craft, was denied in the evening by Gen. Ramey, com- mander of the Eighth Air Force, in Fort Worth, TX: the Air Force officers at Roswell had simply found a weather bal- loon and its radar tar- get, and had mistaken it for a flying saucer! The press accepted at once this curious explanation, and the incident was forgotten for thirty years. However, in 1978, American ufologist Stanton Friedman found al- most by chance a key witness, Jesse Marcel, a former major who had been in charge of security on the base, and who had picked up debris at what is called the crash site. Marcel, who was at that time retired in Louisiana, confirmed to Friedman that these materials were very strange and did not look like anything known. Since then, several teams of research- ers have done considerable work and have found many witnesses who have made Roswell one of the best docu- mented cases in ufology. The theory of a UFO crash is based on three main elements: the press re- lease by the Air Force base, testimo- nies about strange materials found at the site, and testimonies on the discov- ery of a craft and bodies near Roswell. A question quickly comes to mind about the press release: how could these officers of an eh'te corps not only make such a clumsy mistake, if we believe the Air Force, but also worsen their case by making that dramatic an- nouncement, contrary to the rules of military secrecy to which they were especially well trained? If it had been such an incredible con- fusion with a balloon (or a balloon clus- ter in the Mogul story), they should MUFON UFO Journal About the author Gildas Bourdais is a leading French ufologist,.

He is also a frequent presenter at UFO symposiums. have been severely reprimanded, yet this was not the case. Col. Blanchard, who released the report to the press, had a remarkable career with significant promotions. Maj. Jesse Marcel, given high marks by his hierarchy before and after the incident, was promoted to a post of re- sponsibility at the Pentagon. Furthermore, if Maj. Marcel had made such a blunder, would he have talked about it 30 years later? It is in- teresting to note here that when Maj. Marcel was interviewed in 1982 by a student, Linda Corley, he told her that he had not revealed all that he knew, \"for the sake of his country,\" Corley re- vealed twenty years later at the 2000 MUFON symposium. 3 USAF \"explanations\" In 1994, the US Air Force, pressed by an inquiry which had been opened by the General Accounting Office (GAO) of the Congress at the request of Steven Schiff, congressman of New Mexico, replaced the initial explanation of the weather balloon with a more complex one. Now the Air Force claimed that the debris was from the crash of a \"train\" of 20 to 30 weather balloons attached to a line, code-named \"Mogul,\" launched at the base at White Sands. It was, they explained, a very secret"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"project to develop a means of detec- tion of future soviet atomic explosions, and it is the reason why its discovery was hidden at the time. But there is not the faintest bit of pa- per, telex, or archived note which would prove that this was what had been found in Roswell. On the contrary, their documentation shows clearly that the balloon train Mogul number 4, the only one which might have caused that blunder because it was equipped with radar targets, had most probably never been launched! It is absent in the reports of New York University (NYU), in charge of the tests, and geophysicist Albert Crary, who was the field manager, noted in his personal diary that it was cancelled because of cloudy weather. In fact, he launched in the morning a small balloon cluster like the NYU team launched every day in June. It is likely that Brazel found one of them, on June 14, as he told the press under pressure from the military, but he attached no importance to it, and it had nothing to do with the finding of the big debris field at the beginning of July. 4 In any case, if the officers of Roswell had found a Mogul balloon train, they, would have easily identified it as such. It would have been sufficient for them to identify only one element of this mundane gear to close the case, such as one of the instruments attached to the nylon line, which were : not more mysterious: ballast reservoir, electric battery, radio transmitter, or \"sonobuoy\" which looked like a mere metallic can. None of these instruments were found on the Foster Ranch, either by the rancher Brazel or by the military who came to retrieve the debris. In 1997, the US Air Force published a second book to explain, this time, the testimonies on alien bodies. It sug- gested that the witnesses had confused memories of parachute tests which were made with wooden dummies. But, as Walter Haut quipped, \"You have to be a dummy not to recognize a dummy!\" Besides, these tests took place sev- eral years later, during the 50's. This time, the American press, which had U.S. ARMY TO EXAMINE! A •\" I LYING DISK \" ! fH H mum s WASHINGTON, Jin well, New Mexico. iJui :m oh joe [ _lml he-en found ihere.

The only positive aspect of the Air Force report was to have them discard other hypotheses, such as the crash of a secret plane, or a rocket, or an atomic bomber. However, as noted above, such is not the opinion of new Roswell researcher Nick Redfern in his new book, Body Snatchers in the Desert. Following is a-summary of the 'Redfern story of Roswell, slightly abridged, given by Redfern himself in the conclusion of his book (pages 207 and 208): The first crash \"In May 1947, an experimental air- craft that was borne out of the revolu- tionary aviation research of the Horten brothers of Germany was test-flown from White Sands, New Mexico. \"On board the vehicle were a num- ber of physically handicapped people who had been found in the remnants of the Japanese military's Unit 731 labo- ratories and who were used in this dark and disturbing experiment-the purpose of which was to try to better understand the effects of nuclear-powered flight on an air-crew. \"The experiment ended in disaster when the aircraft crash-landed at White Sands, killing some of the crew. MUFON UFO Journal The second crash \"Two months later, in early 1947,\" says Redfern, \"a second arid similar vehicle was once again flown from White Sands. In this particular in- stance, the aircraft was affixed to a huge balloon array that was based upon ad- vanced Fugo balloon designs developed in the closing stages of WW n by Japa- nese forces. \"The aircraft was piloted by a crew of Japanese personnel who had been specifically trained for the task and crashed near the Foster Ranch after being catastrophically struck by light- ning. \"The lifting-body-style aircraft, the balloon materials, and the bodies of the crew were retrieved under cover of overwhelming secrecy and-either de- liberately or unintentionnally-hidden behind a smoke screen of crashed fly- ing saucer stories. \"It is these two incidents (and, as the whistle-blower testimony provided in these pages suggests, possibly several others in the vicinity of White Sands in the early to late summer of 1947) that led to the legend of the Roswell inci- dent,\" says Redfern. A bizarre story A first reaction to Redfern's scenario may be one of perplexity when con- fronted with such a bizarre story, which he claims had been revealed to him November 2005"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"from 1996 to 2003 by several insiders- who remain anonymous in the book. In any case, it seems to provide a global explanation of the Roswell case, encompassing as it does many aspects, even some of the most controversial ones. The story of the alleged first crash, for instance, seems to explain the con- troversial story of the mysterious cam- eraman who, allegedly, sold the famous \"Alien Autopsy Footage\" to the Brit- ish producer Ray Santilli, released in 1995. The \"atomic\" aspect is very impor- tant in Redfern's theory. According to his insiders, it included loading radio- active material on board for an awful experiment of irradiation in flight. In addition, it was supposed to be made at a very high altitude in order to evaluate mysterious \"mutation\" effects. The victims selected for this dread- ful test were supposedly mentally re- tarded, severely handicapped people, formerly prisoners of the Japanese for horrible bio-warfare experiments in Manchuria during WW n. According to Redfern and his in- formers, it is this \"Japanese connection\" which had to be kept secret \"at all costs.\" There was no balloon for this first experiment (in effect, the cameraman did not mention one). The weird craft was supposedly towed on take-off by a DC-3 plane (or rather a C-47, the cor- rect military designation), but was self- propelled af- terwards (we don't learn exactly how). Can we believe that story? Well, there are many big holes in it, as we are going to see. The first, and biggest one, probably, is that it was impossible for the American military to bring to the United States prisoners from Man- churia. Here is, briefly, the history of Japanese biological warfare experi- ments in Manchuria: 5 •1932—Japanese troops invade Manchuria. Shiro Ishii, a physician and army officer who was intrigued by germ warfare, begins preliminary experi- ments. • 1936—Unit 731, a biological-war- fare unit disguised as a water-purifica- tion unit, is formed. Ishii builds a huge compound—more than 150 buildings over six square kilometers—outside the city of Harbin. Some 9,000 test sub- jects, which Ishii and his peers called \"logs,\" eventually die at the com- pound. •1942—Ishii begins field tests of germ warfare on Chinese soldiers and civilians. Tens of thousands die of bu- bonic plague, cholera, anthrax, and other diseases. U.S. soldiers captured in the Philippines are sent to Manchu- ria. • 1945—Japanese troops blow up the headquarters of Unit 731 in the final days of the Pacific war. Ishii orders 150 remaining \"logs\" killed to cover up their experimentation. Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur is named commander of the Allied powers in Japan. • 1946—U.S. coverup of secret deal with Ishii and Unit 731 leaders-germ warfare data based on human experi- mentation in exchange for immunity from war-crimes prosecution-begins in earnest. Deal is concluded two years later. No prisoners from Unit 731 Let's turn now to the Redfern story. According to his inside source, \"Levine\" (p 85): \"When the Japanese surrendered in the wake of the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, a number of these and a quantity of still- living people were found in the remains of Unit 731 facilities (and also German laboratories) by allied soldiers. These remains were subsequently transferred to the Los Alamos Laboratories, New Mexico, where this dark and disturb- ing research was continued.\" Other informers told Redfern a simi- lar story, but this is radically contra- dicted by all historical studies and sources. In his references, Redfern mentions the book of Peter Williams and David Wallace, Unit 731: Japan's Secret Bio- logical Warfare in World War II. 6 It is a very complete history of these horrible experiments, and it clearly de- scribes what happened at the end of the war. When the Soviet army began to in- vade Manchuria, on Aug. 9,1945, the next day the Japanese destroyed all buildings of Units 731 and 100, and killed all the prisoners. They had or- ders to destroy every trace of the ex- periments, and never talk about them. This version is confirmed in the timeline mentioned above, and in other books, for instance The Pacific War by the Japanese historian Saburo lenaga. 7 No handicapped prisoners Another important difference resides in the alleged use of deformed and handicapped people for all these experi- ments, according to Redfern's insiders. This is an important element of the theory since it is supposed to explain the strange aspect of the victims of the crash (at least the first one), and it is repeated through the whole book (at least 16 times, from page 6 to page 207). But it is wrong! Actually, the Japa- nese experimenters at Unit 731 pre- ferred to have subjects in good health: \"Unless you work with a healthy body, you cannot get results.\" 8 So the real story of the end of Unit 731 seems quite different from the one in Body Snatchers. Sunshine and body snatchers In 1994, President Clinton appointed an \"Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments \"(ACHRE) which uncovered a long history of se- cret irradiation experiments conducted during the period 1944 through 1974. Redfern mentions this in his book, and it is all true, but he insists then on a very special project called \"Sunshine\" which was proposed secretly in 1955 (pp. 164 to 166). It was a plan to collect skeletons for such experiments by all possible means through certain \"channels,\" and this was called \"body snatching.\" Hence the bizarre title of the book. Redfern admits that this \"body snatch- ing\" project had nothing to do with Roswell, but he claims that it was \"very similar to the top-secret Roswell-re- lated events\" described in his book. However, this argument of secret radiation experiments can be turned against his book. The records of the ACHRE commission, which count the rather staggering number of some 3,000 tests of human irradiation, don't November 2005 MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"mention at all his alleged radiation ex- periments in White Sands! So there is a simple question: in the light of the ACHRE report, why hide these alleged White Sands irradiation experiments at all cost, since the whole story of similar experiments has been made public? When I asked Redfern this, he stressed again that it was the \"Japanese angle,\" with its horrible experiments in Manchuria, which, was the cause of the extreme secrecy. But, as we have just seen, it is an impossible argument. Regardless of its sheer impossibil- ity, another argument can be made against this \"Japanese angle.\" If these White Sands experiments had been made with Japanese, they would have been identified as such when found in the areas near White Sands or Roswell-even if they were handicapped. The second crash (Roswell) The second crash is the famous one near Roswell. This time the craft is supposedly af- fixed to a huge balloon cluster, derived from advanced Japanese \"Fugo\" projects (Fugo is the name of the bal- loon bombs of WW n), which is going to be used to explain the famous debris field on the Foster Ranch. This time there is no \"atomic\" ex- periment. If you know the Roswell case well, you will remember that Maj. Marcel checked the debris at the Fos- ter Ranch with a Geiger counter and found no radioactivity. Thus Redfern's story seems to fit well with the Roswell testimonies re- garding radiation. But a consequence is that there was no \"reason\" to carry handicapped people on that flight. So, explains Redfern, there were normal Japanese for the second flight, trained as pilots to test this peculiar balloon and fast aircraft coupling. I debated this point with Redfern on the Internet, and he did have an answer to it. 9 Contrary to a general impression given in the book, in which he men- tioned handicapped people all the time to explain the confusion with alien be- ings in Roswell, there were no handi- capped beings in the second crash, near Roswell. They were not identified as Japanese, says Redfern, because the bodies were found and retrieved se- cretly by the White Sands people. Thus, in Redfern's version, the leg- end of alien bodies found in Roswell came later from a merger with the ru- mors coming from the White Sands crash and its handicapped victims. That's an ingenious story, but what is its credibility? As we have seen, there were no handicapped Japanese avail- able in the first place. In addition, the question remains whether there could be such a confusion with handicapped bodies, wrongly identified as alien be- ings, whether it was in White Sands or in Roswell. This is where Redfern throws in the famous \"Alien autopsy footage,\" as a sort of visual proof of his story. According to Redfern's mysterious informers, the \"Alien Autopsy Foot- age,\" released in August, 1995, was actually showing one ot the handi- capped victims of the White Sands crash! This idea has been already discussed in depth, and many experts have dis- carded the idea that this was a human being suffering from a genetic illness. In addition, a very simple objection can be made: if it were a human body, there would have been no need for a complete protection suit, such as is seen in the film (unless the whole film is a scam, but this is not at all what Redfern says). Another look at Roswell crash Let's quote again the final summary of the second crash, near Roswell (pp. 207, 208): 'Two months later, in early July a second and similar vehicle was, once again, flown from White Sands. \"In this particular instance, the aircraft was affixed to a huge bal- loon array that was based upon ad- vanced Fugo balloon designs developed in the closing stages of WW n by Japa- nese forces. \"The aircraft was piloted by a crew of Japanese personnel who had been specifically trained for the task and crashed near the Foster Ranch after being catastrophically struck by light- ning.\" There is an obvious objection, from the start, to this second scenario. The risk that the experiment would be exposed publicly would have been even higher, especially if the huge Fugo balloon cluster (much bigger than the Mogul balloon train with its small weather balloons) drifted in the wind to an undesirable place. What about the risk of a crash land- ing in a populated area? But the ex- perimenters were lucky: the balloon and craft, in the Redfern scenario, landed in the rather desertic area of Roswell. However, such a strange assem- blage, with the alleged huge balloons and a weird plane attached to them, would have been almost impossible to hide from curious eyes in the White Sands area. The scenario of the crash seems also very acrobatic. According to Redfern and his mysterious informers, the craft and balloon were caught in a storm and struck by lightning. A part of the dis- abled plane and, presumably, most of the balloons, were torn away in the- storm, together with one of the Japa- nese who was ejected from the craft. They fell and landed together on the Foster Ranch, while the main body of the craft, carrying the rest of the crew, crashed some twenty miles farther away, where it was later retrieved se- cretly by the White Sands people. In this new explanation of Roswell, we find again the problem, like in the Mogul story, of the people of Roswell not being able to identify a balloon or balloon cluster. This question is now aggravated by adding the wreckage of a small craft, either wooden or metallic, or even a fragment of it. The argument of balloons made of aluminium-coated polyethylene, put forward by Redfern in his book, could not explain at all the description of the very strong foil, impossible to tear, and yet scattered in a multitude of small jagged pieces like the result of a vio- lent explosion. In addition, they were impossible to burn. They just don't correspond to a balloon envelope. In the debate on UFO Updates, David Rudiak pressed Redfern with embarrassing critiques about the debris, as he had done previously on Mogul. Then Redfern came up suddenly with MUFON UFO Journal November 2005"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"a new finding from his informers: he learned that, for the Roswell flight, alu- minium foil, or \"chaffe,\" had been used as a test to confuse radar. So this new, providential element would explain the aluminium-like foil found on the Foster ranch! However, there was no logical reason to hide the flight on radar. On the contrary, there was every reason to track it. Besides, in the scenario of an acci- dent in a big storm, the aluminium foil would have been scattered over a very wide area, not just on the debris field of the Foster ranch. Anyway, this aluminium foil, like the one used for cigarette wrapping, was very mundane, and did not fit the de- scriptions on the witnesses. The informers One of the most questionable aspects of Redfern's story is that all his inform- ers were, one way or another, linked to secret services in Great Britain and in the Unites States. Here they are, in chronological order: *In August 1996, in London, Mr. \"Levine\" (pp. 79-81), is an agent of the Home Office. His colleagues are Mr. \"T,\" intelligence agent at the MOD, and Mr. \"D,\" a CIA \"operative.\" They show him a long version of the \"Autopsy film,\" first released a year before. *In July 2001, in Los Angeles, an old woman whom he calls the \"Black Widow\" approches him at the end of a conference (Chapter 1). She says that she worked on \"special projects\" in Oak Ridge, from the mid-1940s to the early 1950s. The crucial year seems to be 2003, with: «The \"Colonel,\" in November 2003. He is the main informer (Chap- ter 10). He said that he had \"spent 15 years operating deep within the heart of American intelligence. In 1969, he found a top secret document at the Defense Intelligence Agency which \"laid to rest the tales about flying sau- cers and alien bodies recovered from the desert of New Mexico in the sum- mer of 1947 and told the true story about the Roswell events\"; * \"Bill Salter,\" on Dec. 6,2003 (p. 90). He is a former employee of the Psychological Strategy Board. He met in Oak Ridge \"a man employed in a covert intelligence position,\" who had \"previously worked for the Central In- telligence Group\" (CIG). Salter had also been informed by an \"old friend from DOE\"; «A1 Barker, on Dec. 9, 2003. He worked for the Psychological Warfare Center (PWC) in Fort Bragg. There is a remarkable coincidence here. Three separate informers ap- proached Redfern, separately, in less than two months at the end of 2003, and told him the same story! This does suggest a concerted plan to disinform him. The risk of disinformation The question of possible disinforma- tion has been raised, as could be ex- pected. Redfern admitted that it was a possibility, but doubted it for several reasons. Firstly, according to him, there has been, indeed, a lot of disinformation, but in the opposite direction: it was all aimed at propagating false tales of UFO crashes in Roswell and other places, such as Aztec. And this long lasting program of disinformation was imple- mented just to hide the horrible experi- ments in White Sands! In fact, the history of ufology in the United States shows, on the contrary, a hard line of denial of UFOs in general, and especially of UFO crashes. \"A second reason for not being disinformed, pleaded Redfern, is the convergence of independent informers, telling the same story, and of documents revealing certain aspects similar to his story. Yes, several informers told him the same story of prisoners from Unit 731: Mr. Levine in 1996 (p. 85), the Colo- nel in November 2003 (p. 108), Bill Salter on Dec. 6, 2003 (p. 91), and Al Barker three days later! (pp. 91 and 141). But this story is false, and this con- vergence raises the question of a kind of concerted disinformation. As for the documents, the example already mentioned of the \"Sunshine\" and \"Body Snatchers\" program shows the weakness of this argument. It was not related at all to the al- leged experiments in White Sands, and the same can be said of other docu- ments quoted in the book. Actually, there is not one piece of documentation sustaining the story. Notes 'Nick Redfern, Body Snatchers in the Desert.

Of 92 sightings with animal reac- tions, 63 of the reports had an estimated duration for the sighting. Of these, 11 percent were less than 1 minute, 54 per- cent were be- tween 1 minute and 10 minutes, 30 percent were between 10 minutes and 1 hour, and 5 per- cent were more than an hour. In 60 of the 92 animal reac- J° an Woodward tion sightings (65 percent), the UFO is described as maneuvering in some way. Most common were hovering part of the time (27 times), landing or near landing arid departure (17 times), slow moving, meandering, or repeated passes (11 times), and rocking behav- ior or falling leaf movements (5 times). In addition, UFOs not reported to maneuver but described as flying by slowly and/or at low altitude were re- ported 11 times. UFOs that flew by with no further description were re- ported 13 times. The remainder lacked any details about the movements of the UFO. This is not meant as an analysis of maneuvers, but only to demonstrate that complexity was a part of the majority of the UFO events where animals were reported to react. General Observation 4.-Relation- ship to reported sound: Sounds from UFOs are often reported when animals react, and rarely reported when they do not. Because many animals hear both lower and higher frequencies than hu- mans do, and because their hearing is often more acute than human hearing, spund is harder to judge than some other features of UFO sightings. Nonetheless, when witnesses re- ported animals reacting to the UFO's presence, they also reported sound from the UFO 49 percent of the time. When witnesses reported animals did not re- act to the UFO, they reported sound only 8 percent of the time. Of the 92 sightings with animal re- actions, witnesses reported sound 45 times. Of these 45 sightings, the ani- mal reaction most commonly reported was fear (27 times) or alert-alarm be- havior (11 times). '..*.. Interestingly, in the 12 reactions when all animals present seemed un- aware of the UFO, sound was reported only one time. Later, when looking at how particular types of animals react during UFO events, sound appears po- tentially important in the reactions of dogs, cats, and ungulates, and will be examined in more detail with each of these groups. General Observation 5.-Relation- ship to secondary UFO features: As data concerning the UFO itself was collected for this study, certain aspects of the UFO intuitively seemed to have potential in terms of having effects on animals. These are referred to as sec- ondary features of the UFO. In order from most often to least of- ten reported, these are: sound (dis- cussed above); light beams and/or ter- restrial lighting; physiological effects during the sighting; EM effects; wind generation; vapor/mist production; and odor.  •'-..'• UFO sound aside, the other second- ary features of UFOs did not have an apparent relationship to animal reac- tions, but their collective, near-total absence is noted in sightings where ani- mals did not react. Light beams and terrestrial lighting are fairly commonly reported, but their impact on animals appears associated with nighttime ungulate reactions. All of these will be -discussed later as specific animal group reactions are addressed. Otherwise, a variety of these secondary features are scattered among sightings in low numbers, but no indi- vidual feature appeared to correlate with particular animal reactions. However, in sightings where animals did not react or did not react fearfully, all of these secondary features were lacking. Secondary features, including sound, distance of the UFO, and altitude of the UFO may have a circuitous relation- ship in terms of animal reactions. Dis- tance may be the determining factor that results in secondary features being noted and reported by witnesses, and in the reaction or non-reaction of the animals that are present. The secondary features may not be Editor's Note This article, Part Two in a series, is abridged from Ms. Woodward's full presentation, including charts, case descriptions, and other material, which is included in the MUFON booklet Animal Reactions to UFOs. The full report is also included in the 2005 MUFON Symposium Proceedings. (See UFO Marketplace, page 23.) About the Author Ms. Woodward worked with the Na- tional Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) in the 1960's, assisting with the original UFO Evidence (1964). She returned to ufology in 1996 as a field investigator for MUFON and the Fund for UFO Research after retiring from the U.S. Geological Survey as a research technician. She assisted Richard Hall in devel- oping an index of James E. McDonald's correspondence in the Donald E. Keyhoe Archives, and worked on data compila- tion for Hall's Alien Invasion or Human Fantasy? Ms. Woodward later took over the animal reactions section of Francis Ridge's special evidence section of the NICAP web site. She also has extensive experience with both domestic and wild animals. 8 MUFON UFO Journal November 2005"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"heard or seen by a witness when the object is at greater distances. However, in closer encounters, the secondary fea- tures may be more obvious to wit- nesses, and at least some of them noted by animals. For the 92 sightings with animal re- actions, a very rough calculation of al- titudes and distances based on whether or not secondary features were reported suggest this may be true. Where a range is given for distance or altitude in a sighting, an average is used for the calculations below. • Where animals reacted, and one or more secondary features were reported, the average UFO altitude was 238 feet, based on 57 sightings with altitude es- timates. The average UFO distance was 319 feet, based on 55 sightings with distance estimates. • Where animals reacted, but no sec- ondary features were reported, the av- erage UFO altitude was 354 feet, based on 20 sightings with altitude estimates. The average UFO distance was 838 feet, based on 15 sightings with dis- tance estimates. (A questionable animal reaction sighting with an estimated 12-mile dis- tance to the UFO (AR104) was not used in this calculation.) Carrying the distance hypothesis on to the 12 sightings with no animal re- action, and which also have no second- ary features reported, the average alti- tudes and distances become greater. Where there were no animal reac- tions and no secondary features (except one sighting with a sound reported), the average UFO altitude was 886 feet, based on 10 sightings with altitude es- timates. The average UFO distance was 1,620 feet, based on 5 sightings with distance estimates. The closer encounters are more likely to have witnesses report second- ary features of the UFO and animal reactions. Slightly greater distances and alti- tudes may be associated with no sec- ondary features noted by witnesses, but animals may still react, quite possibly because of their excellent hearing or other sense. UFO events at greater distances and attitudes have neither secondary fea- One ofufology 's classic cases, that of Betty and Barney Hill, involved the actions of their dachund, Delsey, during their-encounterwith a UFO in 1961. tures nor animal reactions reported. Much more data is needed for further evaluation, particularly in sightings where animals do not react. Generalization Observation 6.- Relationship to UFO Shape: The re- ported shapes of UFOs are variable, and generally do not seem to relate to particular animal reactions. This report contains 107 descriptions of UFO shapes. These were compared to a much larger Worldwide UFO Da- tabase (WUFOD) compilation table of 1,694 reported shapes as of Jan. 30, 2004 (online at www.indianamufon.com). Shape categories were combined for simplicity because shapes are so depen- dent on angle of vision. As one would expect, UFO shapes in the animal re- action reports were a subset of UFO shapes reported in general. With the rather small sample size in this report, no relationship was found between UFO shapes and specific ani- mals or animal reactions. One possible excep- tion involves sightings with ungulates. Of the 21 sightings where hoofed mammals are present and reported to be uneasy to fearful, 24 percent involve sug- gested or clearly de- scribed hemisphere shapes. The remainder of the sightings involve 9 or 10 other shapes rep- resented by only 1 or 2 sightings each. Another possible ex- ception involves angular UFOs and their associa- tion with relatively mild, less fearful animal reac- tions. Although sizes and exact shapes vary, six sightings describe boxy, rectangular, or square objects. In 4 of 5 sightings with dogs present, the dogs were described as not reactive, calm, or in- terested (AR19, 61, 85, 95). The most intensive reaction was a dog that barked (AR20). In the final sighting a cow was reported frightened by the boxy object (AR10) Data sets for different types of animals Because the senses and behavior between animals differ, and because in- formation about the UFO event is re- layed through human senses, a com- parison of the perceptual worlds of vari- ous animals and humans is worth not- ing. Visual acuity is a measure of the abil- ity to see details. Only birds have bet- ter vision than humans. The acuity of the others animals is not as good as hu- mans, but they are all extremely sensi- tive to motion. All of the animals have a much bet- ter sense of smell and of hearing than humans do, with the exception of birds, who have little sense of smell, and whose hearing is more restricted than that of humans. The temperament of dogs varies widely. One behavior problem with November 2005 MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"many dogs is sound sensitivity. This means the dog has a very fearful reac- tion to a non-threatening, commonly en- countered sound. Examples would be fear of thunder, fear of a flag snapping in the wind, fear of electrical transformers on poles, or fear of the noise of a garage door. This behavior may become worse with age. Six sightings report reactions of chickens (4 times), ducks (2 times), geese (2 times), and pheasants (1 time). Five of the six describe birds that are disturbed, and the remaining incident (AR95) describes calm birds. All sightings with disturbed birds took place at night, and witnesses re- ported bird reactions by hearing them, rather than by seeing them. When birds were disturbed, the UFO altitudes ranged from 80 to 2,000 feet. In the sighting with calm animals, the altitude was 100 feet. Among the birds that were disturbed, the consis- tent overhead position of the UFO at some point during the sighting is inter- esting. Only one sighting (AR47) clearly states that the animals reacted as the UFO passed overhead. In the remain- der the overhead position is relative to the witness, and only a rough approxi- mation for the animals. Unfortunately, none of the sighting reports give details as to the exact lo- cations of the birds (in a chicken coop, bam, or outdoors) or whether or not the sky was visible to them. If they could see the sky, their reac- tion may have been a typical visual re- sponse to an aerial predator. Another interesting possibility is that birds may have felt the UFO's presence through a series of \"touch\" receptors scattered through their bodies. \"Herbst\" corpuscles are highly de- veloped in birds, and are sensitive not only to touch, but also to pressure changes and low frequency vibrations. Finches, experimentally deafened, were trained to detect vibrations from 100 to 3200 Hz through Herbst cor- puscles along the backs of their upper legs (Welty, 1962). If the birds were responding to vi- brations or pressures that they felt, this might explain the importance of the overhead position of the UFO. If they 10 were responding to sound or vision, the overhead position may be of much less impor- tance. Ackerman (1989) suggests a side effect of UFO propulsion may be a magnetic field around the UFO, which is interesting in that there is speculation that birds use geomagnetic clues in migration. Exactly how the magnetic field is de- tected and used by birds and other animals is a subject of much specu- lation. The two leading pos- sibilities are (1) tiny In tne 1976 case in Kentucky involving the ab- crystals of magnetic par- duction of three women from an auto, one of the tides (magnetite) have women, Mrs. Smith, discovered that her four-year- been found in the olfac- old parakeet would have nothing to do with herfol- tory tract in the brains of lowing the abduction. some birds that act as a compass and/or (2) a chemical reaction that involves certain eye pigments that become weakly magnetic when they absorb light (Levy, 1999). This is a complicated explanation for birds reacting to nearby UFOs, but a thought to be tucked away for future reference. Questions to be answered about barnyard birds More information is needed to verify or refute the overhead position of the UFO relative to bird reactions. If verified as a consistent factor, then an interesting next step would be to evaluate sound versus feeling versus vision as a factor in the birds' reactions. Quite possibly the birds will respond to more than one thing, such as anti-hawk reactions when outdoors in the daytime, and to sound or vibrations when confined at night. If the UFO is reported to be silent or high-pitched by the witness, birds will not hear it, as their hearing is more re- stricted than that of humans. All of the sightings in this report occurred at night. Does the excellent vision of birds be- come a factor in daytime and/or out- door sightings? Are geese present? Barnyard geese MUFON UFO Journal are great \"watchdogs,\" and their alarms could cause other birds to react. Sightings with non-reactive barnyard birds present would be of great inter- est. Reactions by cats The presence of cats was reported in nine sightings. Eight sightings oc- curred at night, and one in predawn light. The cats' reactions fall into the following categories: fearful behavior (5 sightings), interested/approach (1 sighting) and no reaction (3 sightings). Altitudes in the nine sightings ranged from 150 feet to 1,600 feet, with no real differences between the behavior groups. The distances, sound, and sec- ondary effects did differ. In the sightings where cats were fear- ful, the UFOs tended to be closer, to make noise, and to demonstrate other secondary effects. This contrasts strongly with non-fearful cats, where the objects are generally farther away and no secondary effects were reported. The weakest fearful cat reaction is described in AR60. The cat was de- scribed as \"fearful,\" but further de- scribed only as \"fussing to get into the house\" as the witness watched a UFO at least 500 feet away. Possibly the cat's November 2005"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"behavior was coincidental to the UFO event. The overhead position of the UFO (3 of 5 sightings) is interesting in that cats' whiskers are embedded in highly packed, sensitive nerve endings. Through their whiskers, cats are thought to detect small changes in pres- sure, air movement, and temperature. Possibly cats not only heard the UFO, but also, like barnyard birds, may have felt its presence. Cats can hear high frequencies bet- ter than either humans or dogs, so it is always possible that cats hear sounds to which humans are oblivious. Hu- mans can hear low-pitched sounds that cats do not hear, but possibly cats can feel them. The sightings with fearful cats tend to have sound associated with them, and unfamiliar, harsh, and/or loud sounds are the leading inanimate cause of startle or fear responses in cats. At least two of the sounds reported above fit into harsh or loud category, and none are described as high pitched. A theoretical thought about cats and sounds: we know harsh and loud sounds frighten cats. Low or moderate humming sounds may also be threat- ening if one thinks about the similarity of that sound to the growl of a dog, for instance. On the other hand, cats can, as al- ready noted, hear very high-pitched sounds, and can pounce on a mouse by hearing its ultrasonic squeak. Thus, within some loudness parameters, high-pitched sounds (i.e., prey sounds) may not be disturbing to cats, or may be interesting to them, and deep, low pitched sounds may be perceived as threatening. Questions to be answered by investigators about cats Does the overhead position of the UFO occur frequently in sightings where cats react fearfully? Does the witness detect any vibration, pressure change, or air movement during these sightings? Is the sound low, moderate, or high-pitched? Is it harsh and loud or soft? Is it steady or cyclic? To what might the sound be compared? Do cats react fearfully when UFOs are silent or high-pitched? November 2005 Ungulates The most common reaction noted for ungulates in UFO events was fear. Of the 22 sightings in which cattle (14 times), horses (10 times), goats (2 times), and sheep (1 time) were present, sometimes in combinations thereof, fearful reactions were reported in 20 sightings, nervous reactions once, and calm reactions once (AR95). No sightings were found that men- tioned ungulates that did not react, so a comparison cannot be made between sightings with and without reactions. Because cows, horses, and sheep are frequently out in fields or in bams at some distance from witnesses, their reactions are probably not noticed un- less they are eye or ear catching. Seven sightings took place in day- light or twilight, 14 took place at night, and one took place after sundown with lighting conditions unknown. Distances and altitudes Where estimated, the UFO altitudes ranged from landed or near landed (6 times) to a maximum estimate of 450 feet (1 time). The most common alti- tudes reported were between 25 and 200 feet (8 times). The distances ranged from overhead (4 times) to 3-5 miles away (1 time), although I am suspicious that the horse in AR02 was reacting to the distant light. Next farthest was about 1 mile, and appropriately, the cattle were not reported fearful, only nervous. The most common distances were evenly distributed from overhead (4 times) and from roughly overhead to 200 feet away (4 times), with farther estimates being 300 feet away (2 times), 600 feet (1 time) and a quarter mile(l time). Referring again to the study of wild animal anti-predator reactions to human vehicles (Frid and Dill, 2002), cattle will react fearfully to an unfamiliar piece of equipment or unfamiliar ve- hicle, so possibly the existence of the UFO vehicle itself would be disturb- ing to them. Wild cattle have a flight zone, the point where they break and run, of about 300 feet (online at www.BueLingo.com), comparing fa- vorably with UFO distances of 200 feet or less to 300-500 feet. MUFON UFO Journal Secondary UFO effects Putting aside AR02 and 28, with their 1-mile or greater distances to the UFO, 19 sightings describe fearful un- gulates, and all of these had some sec- ondary feature described. AR87 is an atypical sighting with an atypical secondary effect: a 30-foot, brilliant blue ring was observed over a field containing cattle that were racing away from it as power lines were swinging in a 6 foot arc. The remaining 18 sightings all have one to 4 secondary features. Many of these secondary features could theoreti- cally affect animals, but occur so er- ratically that they do not seem to be of overall importance. Possibly wind or air generation from the UFO, mist or vapor escaping the UFO, and odor could all be connected in terms of transporting a scent from the UFO that animals can detect. Witnesses rarely report an odor, but the animals' sense of smell is far supe- rior to ours. Possibly microwave or electromag- netic waves cause the feelings of heat, electricity, and immobilization reported by witnesses as well as EM effects on machinery-all of which could poten- tially affect animals. These secondary features may be factors in a given sighting, but they do not appear regularly in sightings where ungulates react fearfully, while other secondary features do regularly occur. Sound and terrestrial lighting The more consistent secondary fac- tors in these sightings are sound from the UFO and terrestrial lighting. Both of these are considered fear triggers. In the 18 sightings above, all have either sound or terrestrial lighting re- ported, and four sightings report both. Sound is reported by the witnesses 14 times, and its presence is unknown in AR45, where a mower with the engine running during the sighting prevented the witness from knowing if the objects made sound. Terrestrial lighting is reported in 6 of 12 nighttime sightings and is sug- gested in AR37, where the UFO is de- scribed as the size of two rooms and \"bluish-white... like the glow around a welder's arc.\" Unfamiliar sounds, particularly loud 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"and/or high pitched, stress and scare cattle and horses, supporting the impor- tance of sound in ungulate reactions. Even when sound is not reported by witnesses, ungulates may be hearing ultrasonic sounds, although they can- not hear as high frequency sounds as cats and dogs. In AR44, the witness reported that a flat-bottomed oval object about 200 feet in altitude remained directly overhead as he ran to his house. Only when the object was directly overhead could he hear an eerie high-pitched sound, but his dog and cattle were reacting when the object was at distance from them. Lights and shadows are disturbing to ungulates. One way to stop cattle dead in their tracks and possibly send them stampeding in the opposite direc- tion is to throw an unexpected light (or shadow) across their path. Safety suggestions for handling or moving these animals at night or in dim light involve solid board fences (so lights will not shine between the boards), frosted/dim bulbs that cast no shadows, and avoidance of any bright, glaring light (Grandin, 1989, updated 2002; online BueLingo.com.). Put into a UFO scenario, imagine a field swept by lights and shadows as lights on a low flying UFO sweep through the area. AR 11 is an excellent example be- cause this object was moving slowly, did not land, and had no sound reported, but the cattle stampeded as its brilliant red light lit up their field. A bonus in this report is the observation that the 50 cows calmed down once the UFO departed. When prey animals such as ungu- lates are confined in barns, they are in a vulnerable position because they are trapped. If something frightens them, their instinct is to run, but if they are tied or penned in a bam, they cannot. So unfamiliar sounds and/or lights and shadows that sweep through the cracks and windows of a barn could be extremely disturbing. Witnesses will hear vocalizations and hoofs hitting wood as the animals startle and try to escape. Of four sightings with animals in barns, three had UFO sounds reported, and one, possibly two, had terrestrial lighting. Animals in bams could be rea- sonably expected to react to either un- familiar sound or unfamiliar lights flashing through the barn, or to both. UFO Shapes As mentioned in the generalized sec- tion on UFO shapes and animal reac- tions, dome-shaped or hemispheric UFOs are presented in greater numbers than other shapes among the sightings with ungulates, being reported in 5 sightings (AR03,40, 44,45, and 52). For comparison, the next most often reported shapes are domed discs (3 times). Football-shaped, Saturn- shaped, round, angular, and light only (no shape) are all reported 2 times each. Comparing the domes reported in the five sightings, four have a solid, clearly seen structure, and one (AR40, Delphos) was reported to be so brightly glowing that the surface could not be seen. Only AR45 was a daylight sighting that involved five hemispheric objects near the ground, and it is also the only sighting where sound was not reported. The witness had a mowing engine run- ning, so did not know if the five hover- ing domes made any noise. Of the other four sightings, humming was reported one time (AR03) and rumbling, high-pitched sounds were re- ported for the remaining three. Size estimates fell into two catego- ries: 25 feet in diameter or length (AR03 and 52) and 8-12 feet. In all cases the objects were reported to lin- ger, hover, or land. Years of the sightings were 1953, 1971, 1974 (February and then Sep- tember), and 1980. Whether the dome shape has any significance to sightings with ungulate reactions remains to be seen, and is pointed out with hopes of gathering more information. Questions for investigators to answer about ungulate reactions The reactions of these animals may be in response to all aspects of the UFO sighting, to some of them, or to only one part. Without sightings involving animals that do not react, it is much harder to theorize about which part of the UFO experience is disturbing. To help with this process of eliciting information on non-reactive animals, the witnesses might be asked: 1. Were any animals present during the sighting? Were they indoors or out- doors? 2. Could the witness see the animals? 3. Did the animals remain unaware of the object or did they react to it? 4. How did they react? What exactly did they do? 5. Where was the UFO relative to your location and the location of the animals? 6. Are the animals accustomed to low-flying aircraft? 7. If the animals reacted, when did they calm down? And, another helpful piece of infor- mation would be about the quality and harshness of the sound of the UFO, if any. Was the sound soft, medium, loud, or harsh; was it low-pitched, medium pitched, high-pitched? Can the wit- nesses think of anything they have heard to which they could compare the sound? If terrestrial lighting or light beams are reported, helpful information would be what terrestrial areas were lit? Was it the field with horses/cattle present, the adjoining field, outside of the barn, or some more distant area? (Continued next month) Space ships may be made of plastic NASA scientists have invented a groundbreaking, polyethylene-based material called RXF1 that's even stron- ger and lighter than aluminum. This new material is a first in the sense that it combines superior structural proper- ties with superior radiation shielding. The safest way to go to Mars may be aboard a plastic spaceship. Protect- ing astronauts from deep-space radia- tion is a major unsolved problem be- cause a round-trip could last as long as 30 months and be outside Earth's mag- netic field. Some scientists believe go- ing to Mars now with an aluminum spaceship is undoable. Plastic is an appealing alternative, since polyethylene is 50% better at shielding solar flares and 15% better for cosmic rays. Plastic-like materials produce far less secondary radiation than heavier materials like aluminum or lead. 12 MUFON UFO Journal November 2005"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Alien videotaped in Mexico?

Raw material of ufology Grass Roots UFOs — Case Reports from the Timmerman Files by Dr. Michael D. Swords, 2005, Fund for UFO Research, Inc., Center for UFO Studies, P.O. Box 1621, Lima, OH 45802,5 '/z x 8 ¥2 soft cover, 251 pages, $22 (including postage). Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Journal editor This is an important book, not be- cause it thor- oughly docu- ments specific, fully-investi- gated cases, but because it indicates the great number of ordinary people who have had UFO experiences. Like Dick Hall's UFO Sightings in the New Mil- lennium (reviewed last month), the cases reported in this book have not been investigated. As John Timmerman, who compiled the cases, notes, \"Our main purpose in creating this book has been to capture some firsthand testimony for the ages, if not the hard evidence that Carl Sagan once told me was needed for useful scientific analysis.\" He adds, \"I call it 'the raw material of ufology.' They have for me the lin- gering taste of truth.\" Swords notes that each case repre- sents \"a dynamic and natural conver- sation, not an Investigator's Manual checklist, and so some stuff gets left out...The reports-in vast majority- seem particularly honest.\" The way in which Timmerman col- lected this material is a story in itself. It goes back to 1980 when the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) assembled a UFO exhibit for a mall in Dallas, TX. An estimated 50,000 people viewed the Dallas exhibit, and this encouraged CUFOS to expand it-eventually creat- ing two identical exhibits.These were then displayed hi 92 malls, schools, uni- versities, banks, and other facilities over the next twelve years in locations rang- ing from Nova Scotia to Guam to Puerto Rico. At the first exhibit, in Dallas, view- ers freely talked about their sightings. Notes were taken, and these began to pile up. From Dallas the exhibit went to Grand Island, ME, and a tape recorder was set up to document the interviews. By the time the exhibit had its final en- gagement in Sterling, IL, in 1992, the taped interviews totaled 1,179. One of the traveling exhibits was sold to the International UFO Museum in Roswell, and the other exhibit went to the town of St. Paul, Alberta, in west Canada as a permanent display to at- tract visitors. Those involved with the project knew the reports should be transcribed, and Timmerman was able to find an in- dividual to do this-a difficult job, since not all the speakers had clear voices. It was also difficult to make sure the names of witnesses were spelled cor- rectly-which was not a problem for this book, since names are not used. How- ever, some place names may be mis- spelled. The 22 three-ring notebooks contain- ing the transcripts were taken to Lima, OH, and Swords, a retired natural sci- ences and environmental studies fac- ulty member at Western Michigan Uni- versity, began the task of coding the cases and extracting what he felt was the most important information. This process took more than a year. Swords grouped cases into 40 sec- tions devoted to different categories of UFO experiences. He comments, \"Sometimes that may be puzzling. Well, don't worry about it. Just enjoy the stories.\" And finally, he added drawings of the cases. \"Almost no one gave John a drawing of their experience's UFO,\" says Swords. \"Almost all of the simple November 2005 MUFON UFO Journal 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"line drawings in this document are made up out of my reading of the case....As with the honesty and tone of the story condensations, I tried to give as unembellished a line drawing as the words in the case allowed.\" Within the 1,179 cases there were 781 shaped objects, 291 with lights or \"unseeable structures,\" 35 \"classic\" UFOs, and 72 cases with no UFO re- ported. Of the 781 shaped objects, 651 were discs and \"objects with radical symme- try,\" 85 had \"odd\" shapes, and 45 were triangles or boomerangs. CE II reports include 14 involving vehicle interference, 14 with physi- ological effects, 16 leaving traces with UFO present, and 18 leaving traces without a reported UFO. CE III cases feature 36 involving entities with a UFO, and 35 with enti- ties but without a UFO reported. Interestingly, these cases reported to Timmerman over a span of 12 years pretty well match what are generally considered heavy (flap) and light years of UFO reports, as both Timmerman and Swords point out. The famous Edwin Fuhr sighting at Langenberg, Saskatchewan, on Sept. 1, 1974, is treated at length in a reprint- ing of a 1991 interview involving Fuhr, Timmerman, and Canadian researcher Chris Rutkowski. Section 44 of the book includes a helpful alphabetic listing of sightings by cities, towns, and locations, and Sec- tion 45 lists by date and location where and when the exhibits were displayed. GrassRoots UFOs is unique, well done, and timeless. It is great reading, and would make an excellent addition to anyone's UFO library. The weird and interesting Unnatural Phenomena, A Guide to the Bizarre Wonders of North America by Jerome Clark, 2005, ABC Clio, 7 x 10 hardcover, 369 pages, available from Sheridan Books, Inc., 100 N. Staebler Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48103, $85.00. Reviewed By Dwight Connelly Journal editor This book by respected ufologist Jerry Clark is the result of the author's 14 longtime interest in anomalies, and his decision to go back to 19 th and early 20 th century sources to locate material similar to what Charles Fort was fa- mous for documenting. Much of this research was done on the internet, a process which took \"a solid year of long days, usually seven of them a week,\" according to Clark. The result is an interesting collection of \"Fort-like\" anomalies that are \"not in Fort's books, and 90 percent or more have never been be- tween book covers be- fore,\" says Clark, who is perhaps best known for his excellent UFO Encyclopedia. Those fa- miliar with Fort will know what to ex- pect-ghost lights, serpents, airships, objects falling from the sky, spiritual manifestations, and much, much more. For the most part, the reports are \"ex- actly as written\" by a newspaper re- porter or editor. Clark is well aware that some of these reports are probably the result of a reporter or editor needing to make up something to fill space or sell a news- paper. He also points out that \"anomalous occurrences may be experientially real, but it does not follow that all of them are 'real' on an event level.\" In other words, humans may not always see what they think they see. The book is well organized, as one would expect from Clark. The reports are divided by states, and the table of contents lists all of the reports that will appear under each state. In addition, there is an excellent in- dex for those who want to look up vari- ous types of reports, be it by subject or geographical locale. The 14-page Introduction is excel- lent, setting the stage for the reports, and providing insight and background that only someone like Clark could pro- vide. Those who enjoy Fort's books MUFON UFO Journal should like this surprisingly expensive (yes, $85.00 is not a misprint) book very much, as should all those individu- als who enjoy actual reports of strange animals, strange lights, and strange oc- currences. MUFON Forum Dear Mr. Connelly, I would like to comment on the ar- ticle by Dan Wright in the August, 2005, issue of the MUFON UFO Jour- nal. I think it would interest anyone in- volved with meteors and meteorites. Throughout my life I heard my mother speak of a meteorite that she once witnessed. Her description of the event was always pretty much the same, so I have no reason to doubt her account. When she was around age ten she lived with her parents on a farm in ru- ral Iredel County, NC. As she played around in the yard, not far from the house, she was startled by something impacting the ground nearby. She ran over to it to see what it was. She described it as a red-hot rock partially imbedded in the soil. It was too hot to touch, so she ran into the house and called her mother out to see the rock. After it had cooled, they re- trieved the rock and put it to use as a door prop. She described the appearance of the rock as having imprints about the size of the fingers, which I took to be abla- tion marks caused by interaction with the atmosphere. What this suggests to me is that the atmosphere can slow down what is left of a falling meteorite from something like seven miles per second at the time it is captured by the Earth's gravity until it impacts the ground at only a fraction of such a speed. I commented to my mother on more than one occasion that she was ex- tremely lucky to have witnessed the falling of a meteorite at close range. She lived to be 93 years old. Kind Regards, Robert D.

California triangle SAN DIEGO — On July 4, 2005, at 9 PM a bright triangle with orange lights was spotted above Mission Bay, so the witnesses parked on a hill to ob- serve it. \"Very high over Mission Bay,\" says one of the witnesses, \"I saw a very bright orange ball, and as it got closer it looked like a V. It had five bright or- ange lights on each arm of the V. \"It moved very fast to the left, stopped, then moved forward and to the right. There also appeared to be some type of dripping orange fire from it, like a flare, but this only happened twice. \"Then the lights went out one at a time on the arms, and it just looked like a star that faded out. I was sober as hell and still pretty freaked out about it. \"I am an educated middle age woman, and never saw anything like it. I just can't believe we were the only ones to see it.

Japanese crew films at Area 51 Eugene Cuthbertson writes, \"I go a long way back in UFOlogy to NICAP and APRO. I've had a few sightings, accompanied a Japanese NHK video team to Area 51, and had a very brief close encounter. \"The Japanese NHK film crew got some good stuff, and I have a copy of it on video, which I am going to convert to CD and into this Dell computer, as an MPEG. \"The Japanese were careless, and worried me a great deal. This has been a few years ago, before Freedom Ridge was closed. The Japanese monitored George Filer the security patrols, and you can hear the patrol radio back that his area is clear. \"When the patrol went back, the Japanese waited a short time, contin- ued to monitor security, illegally I think, then followed him back in, but I don't know how close we actually were. \"On the video you can see a fairly large lighted craft emerge straight up.

It rose suddenly, hovered, then dived and sped away after five minutes. The witness reports, \"I stopped and watched it; the flashing continued in an irregular, fluttery fashion, and it con- tinued its southerly motion against the wind. \"After perhaps two minutes of ob- servation, the object was due south of me. It suddenly rose very rapidly to a position probably 70 degrees above the horizon and stood motionless.

Idaho close encounter with disc MERIDIAN — The male witness states, \"I was approached by a strange flying light while driving home on July 8,2005.1 was driving home to Merid- ian with my aunt and her grandkids from Fruitland, OR, and we left close to midnight. \"I took the Franklin exit off of Inter- state 84 by mistake. So I just headed north till I hit Cherry Lane Road, which is a back road to Meridian. There was no other traffic, and all we could see was a lot of open unused fields. \"From out of nowhere a strange light approached the side of the car at ground level and then flew right over us. It hardly made any sound. All I could see were four bright white lights that were round in shape. \"It felt like I was being watched for a split second. After it flew over the car it dove down into the field next to us and its lights went out. I saw that it didn't look anything like a plane. It looked more like a long wing or saucer shape. \"I saw one light come on after the bright ones went out. It was a small blinking blue light. After it had swooped down in the field, I saw it whip around and jump back up into the sky. \"I felt lucky this thing didn't crash into us, and I just kept driving. I looked back in my rear view mirror, and it was just hovering above the trees.\" The female witness states, \"We were going back to Meridian, ID, and were driving along west on Cherry Road. All of a sudden a strong light from out of nowhere beamed on us. \"It was a bright white light. The ob- ject flew right in front of us and passed us in to a field. A beaming strong light shined on us as the object flew by. The lights went out, and a blue flashing light came on. The object stopped and turned around and went back up in the sky.\" New Hampshire cigar shape EXETER — An Instructor Flight Engineer on the P3 Orion and EP-3 Reconnaissance aircraft with 10,000 hours of flight time called Peter Dav- enport to report \"an enormous silver ci- gar-shaped object in the sky at about a 40 degree angle above the horizon about 3:15 PM on July 20, 2005.\" He reports he was shocked to see the object hovering almost motionless, back-dropped by clear, blue sky in partly cloudy conditions with a west wind at 9 mph.

I also worked for Boeing in Everett, WA, as a quality assurance manager lead- ing a team of 65 people in the Systems Installation Division on the Boeing 777 Production Line. \"F ve flown over the entire globe, and never seen anything like this cylinder. This object was about twice the size of a modern day US Navy Nimitz Class aircraft carrier flying without sound. \"I thought it was between 2,500 and 3,500 feet in altitude, because the clouds were at 5,000 feet. There was also a row of large windows evenly spaced around the entire perimeter of the object a little bit higher than center. \"The object was moving from the west directly toward me, heading in an easterly direction and moving very slowly at less than 100 knots. \"There was this strange looking cloud of orange/red flames that started growing and billowing underneath the entire bottom of the object. \"The billowing fiery clouds re- minded me of the way napalm rolls along on the vintage war film footage of Viet Nam I've seen on television, except that there was no smoke associ- ated with it. It looked as if the air itself had been suddenly ignited in a large billowing cloud of flames. \"Just as I was about to turn and run into the house due to fear, the fiery cloud grew larger, and it seemed to be pushing back toward the western end of the object. \"Once it reached its peak (probably about half the diameter of the object), the object seemed to stretch out about twice its original size toward the east- ern end, thus filling the entire sky in front of me, and then in the wink of an eye the western end of the object caught up with the eastern end and it simply disappeared right in front of me. \"This was absolutely one of the most amazing things I have ever seen in my life, and in my opinion this was not something man made-and it was far too big to be a blimp or an airplane. I be- lieve it was not of this Earth.\" Peter Davenport was impressed by the demeanor, eloquence, and appar- ent sincerity of the witness. Thanks to Peter Davenport. Indiana object photographed ROANN — The witness reports, \"I saw a silver diamond shape craft on July 1,2005, at 7:05 PM and thought it was an airplane. It was still, then it flipped to its side and vanished. \"I had my digital camera, and just started taking pictures of where it had been as I kept driving. I saw nothing except traces in the sky, like smoke or rocket trails. \"When I downloaded the pictures I found five or six photos of the UFO, with two pictures showing smoke circles and a zigzag pattern in the sky. It must have been traveling real fast, because the camera caught what I could not see. \"It was a ball of fire with a black ob- ject in the center.

The object was thin when viewed head-on. It appeared to be at least 500 feet, but less than 1,000 feet, long, and 100-200 feet wide. The object flew over Astoria Boulevard, then made a wide circle and flew over the East River November 2005 to the island of Manhattan, turning to fly south down its spine on Manhattan's west side. The duration of the sighting was five minutes. It was similar to a banner be- ing towed. \"However,\" says the wit- ness, \"at no time did I see an airplane towing it, and there was no writing or advertisement on the grayish black ob- ject.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport.

Astronomical Conditions: N/A • daylight-sunrise 07:04 Meteorological Conditions: 22 de- grees F, clear sky, very light winds from north. Primary Witness: Claude Edwards, 64, farmer, no inter- est in flying sau- cers or publicity. He requested his name not be used, but he is now deceased. I learned of the case from a friend of his brother. After sev- eral weeks I managed to locate his very remote farm. Case Details I visited briefly with Claude at his modest home, gaining his confidence that I wouldn't reveal any information about the location or his name as long as he was alive. He didn't like talking about the event at first, but became more comfortable as we discussed the weather and world events. I asked him to relive the event in real time, and we began on his front porch, which faces the large bam near the land- ing area. On the morning of the event he left the house at 07:00, four minutes be- fore sunrise. The area was already brightly illuminated, as it was a clear, crisp day. As he walked down the long, rocky slope toward a large barn, he had cov- ered 258 feet of the 310 feet between the house and barn when he noticed the cattle looking toward a field to the east. 18 Through scattered trees to his left he saw . a gray-green object \"like a giant mush- room\" in the field east of the barn. At this point he was 180 feet from the landed object. When he reached the barn, Claude placed the feed bucket he was carrying inside the barn and latched the door. As he turned to look again at the device, he could see several small fig- ures moving rapidly under the object. Claude decided at this point that some- thing very odd was in the field. He had a clear unobstructed view of the object resting on the ground 70 feet away. Between him and the object were scattered cows and two fences. He climbed over the first gate, and as he reached the second fence the small fig- ures started moving around behind a vertical central shaft under the object. The small figures were gray-green in color, and less than 1 meter tall. They moved around directly beneath the de- vice. As they moved, he could see arms or levers moving rapidly. They had either wide-set large eyes or goggles. He noted a protuberance where the nose and mouth would have been. He could see no legs or move- ment on the lower part of their bodies. He further described the figures as appearing \"like a penguin, not human, with no visible neck.\" Claude picked up two rocks, \"pretty good size they were,\" and went over the second gate determined to \"knock a hole in the thing and keep it on the ground.\" In full sunlight, Claude reached a point 15 feet from the device and was stopped by an unseen force which seemed to extend around the object. He couldn't feel it or see it, \"it was just a MUFON UFO Journal Tuscumbia object sketched by Claude Edwards. pressure. He backed up about 10 feet and tossed a rock at the object, but the rock hit something at the 15-foot point and bounced back into the field. There was no sound of impact. Determined, he threw the second rock toward the area above the device. The rock skipped as if on water, with no sound, into the field beyond the object. Claude was a bit upset, but felt compelled to stand there 15 feet away watching it. The surface was seamless, like gray-green silk. The object, \"just looked like a big shell, grayish-green looking outfit,\" said Claude. \"And underneath there were oblong holes where the lights were coming out. They were so bright you couldn't see when you got up there.\" Around the lower rim were evenly spaced oval openings. They were 12 inches long and about 12 inches apart. They were displaying brilliant colors from inside each opening. The colors changed rapidly as if a color wheel was turning inside the object. The central shaft was the same color as the main portion of the object, tubu- lar in shape, extending from the under- neath section and positioned in the cen- ter of the circular base. The object had a diameter of 18 feet, and was 8 feet thick; the central shaft was 3 feet tall. There was no sound at any time. The object suddenly and silently November 2005"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"rocked back toward him slightly three times, and on the third time lifted quickly off the ground. The central shaft was seen pulling up into the base until it was flush and invisible to the eye. The object gained speed rapidly, lev- eled off, and flew towards St. Eliza- beth to the ME, disappearing quickly into the distance. \"The whole thing took over five minutes,\" explained Claude, \"maybe ten. I never seen anything like it.\" When I arrived at the scene more than three months after the event, the site was still quite visible. There was a one-meter slightly irregular circle where the shaft had rested. The soil was extremely dehydrated in contrast with the surrounding soil. There was a depression 20 mm deep sloping to 30 mm at the central area. In the center there was an imprint, oval in configuration, 100 mm x 65 mm. The imprint extended vertically downward to a depth of 100 mm with an extension 25 mm long,the depth of the imprint shaft. Desktop fusion reactor developed For more than half a century, physi- cists have been trying to harness fusion, the nuclear reaction that makes the sun shine and hydrogen bombs explode. But experimental reactors built so far have been gigantic, expensive furnaces that produce less energy than they con- sume. Now UCLA researchers have built a fusion reactor the size of a lunch bucket-and they say they can prove it works. The reactor uses heat to create elec- tricity in a crystal bathed in deuterium gas, an isotope of hydrogen. The result- ing charge strips electrons from the deuterium atoms, repelling them and focusing them into a fast-moving stream so energetic that it triggers fu- sion when it collides with a target. The device still produces less energy than it consumes. But the neutrons re- leased by the reaction could be useful for irradiating tumors, scanning bag- gage or even powering a spacecraft. -John Morgan, Newsweek. November 2005 One of the photos taken by Troy Wallis on March 5 from a Carnival cruise ship two to three miles off the coast ofBaja, on their way to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Man, wife observe UFO from Carnival cruise ship Investigator: Charles C. Reever, N. California MUFON, Chief Investiga- tor, State Section Director. Referred by: Ruben Uriarte, N. California State Director. Witnesses: Mr. and Mrs. Troy Wallis. Date of sighting: May 5, 2005. Time of sighting: 11PM Duration of sighting: 30-40 min- utes. Other: Photos taken by witness. Narration In May of this year, Troy Wallis, 33, and his wife were on a Mexican cruise, three days at sea. At about 11 PM they were on the stern of the ship looking at stars when an object which seemed far away was seen flickering. Mr. Wallis had recently purchased a Minolta digital camera with 4 mega pixel resolution and a zoom lens, so he began taking photos of the object, the first photo without zooming. He reports that the ship was steady, and he made an effort to brace himself as he took the photos. He zoomed the camera at high resolution and took sev- eral photos from the same location. The object, which appeared to be in MUFON UFO Journal the shape of a circle, changed color, flut- tered, turned sharply, changed shape, and hovered. It appeared to be solid, and one photo shows a definite disc shape with structure. The disc appeared to be about 70 % illuminated, but it is not known if this was self illumination, from lights on the cruise ship, or partially enhanced by the camera's automatic exposure setting. Some of the photos appear to show jagged flight lines, and a star can be seen in two of those photos as a disc of light and not fuzzy, indicating that the camera was not moved and was in fo- cus. Mr. Wallis does not think the jagged light maneuvers were made by the disc- shaped object. He was not yet familiar enough with the camera to be able to tell the investi- gator the shutter speed at which he was shooting. Although he has Photoshop, he says the images were not enhanced in any way. The witness, who is manager of a graphic design shop, was judged to be sincere and reliable. Although a hoax cannot be ruled out, as the witness has graphics experience, this is unlikely. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PERCEPTIONS By Stanton T. Friedman A visit to China Over the years I have heard many bits and pieces about ufology in China, and had met with Paul Dong, who had written a book about UFOs in China years ago. And I had also met with Moon Fong, a MUFON representative and UFO activist from Hong Kong, in California a few years back. Therefore, I was quite pleased when a Wisconsin MUFON member referred me to Yan Jin, who lived in the same Wisconsin town. Yan's father is Fan Jin, who is presi- dent of the Dalian UFO Society, vice president of the International Chinese UFO Association, and executive chair- man of the World UFO Convention. I was informed that there would be an international UFO conference in Dalian, China, a large coastal city in Northeastern China, in September, 2005.1 expressed interest, and we had a number of e-mails back and forth. There were a lot of details to be pinned down, such as how my airline tickets and other expenses would be covered. I offered to speak for no fee, since the thought of a trip to China was very enticing. I then heard from Ms. Moon Fong, who was planning to go to the Dalian Conference with a few of her col- leagues, but would be interested in hav- ing me speak for her organization, The Hong Kong UFO Club, which often sponsors lectures by international visi- tors She would handle travel arrange- ments. I had to provide a written for- mal paper for Dalian, and used my 2005 MUFON Symposium paper, \"Government UFO Lies,\" which was later translated into Chinese, and is in- cluded in English in the 36th Interna- tional UFO Proceedings of the 2005 MUFON Symposium. The dates for Dalian would be Sept. 8-10.1 would fly to Hong Kong on Sept. 4, and spend a few days doing interviews with Hong Kong media people. We would fly up to Dalian (3.5 hours) for part of the Conference, then back to Hong Kong where I would speak on \"Flying Saucers ARE Real\" the afternoon of Sunday, Sept. 11, at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. They were charging about $80 HK admission, or about $10 US. I appreci- ated their willingness to possibly lose money. There was a lot of discussion about the trans- lation. Consecu- tive or simulta- neous?. I have done both be- fore, but con- secutive has two major disadvan- Stan Friedman tages. One is that lecture time is effectively cut in half, and it is hard to concentrate when doing many short bits, waiting for translation, etc. When speaking in Mexico, one si- multaneous interpreter had stood next to me. I spoke English, she used the microphone, and was only a few sec- onds behind me in Spanish! That was a real treat. No such luck in China. I think they were all surprised that I didn't read my lectures and couldn't just hand them a transcript. This I have never done. I speak \"extemporaneously\" (well re- hearsed), using the slides as pointers along the way. Frankly, I don't like to be read to, except perhaps by a poet reading his or her own poetry. Moon wanted my script and was shocked when I said there wasn't one. I had some slides put on a CD which was also used for a small booklet they prepared. I then took a lot of time to sort of write out my \"oral\" slide illus- trated lecture so she could work on translating. Anyway, things went more or less as planned-at least in Hong Kong. I did seven interviews. All the interviewers were friendly, no automatic debunkers. Newspaper articles appeared. The lecture was sold out almost a week in advance (300 seats + 20 last minute standing room only places). The questions made sense. Many were in English, as of course Hong Kong was run by Britain for many years. I was on one side of the stage, and the panel of three translators was at the other side of the stage. They had trans- lated in advance some of my lecture to make it faster and more accurate and easier. My slides went over well, with a very unusual slide machine featuring an assistant feeding one slide at a time. One of the interpreters was Dr. Jo- seph Wong, a professor and laboratory manager at the City University of Hong Kong. I was able to visit his lab and spend some time with him. I was frankly very impressed. He and Moon were sort of co-hosts. I did get to see a few multistory shop- ping malls and, thanks to Dr. Wong, a very crowded and very extensive sort of outdoor bazaar area at which ven- dors were selling almost anything you could imagine.That was quite a contrast to the malls. Things were much more compli- cated in Dalian. The facility was not im- pressive; I suddenly found that I was limited to 20 minutes, that the inter- preter would be at the back of the hall, and they had no slide projector, al- though I had requested one many months before. This was the first time in my 38 years of lecturing that a projector could not be found. We delayed a day while a pro- jector was sought in Dalian; no luck, although metropolitan Dalian has a population of almost 5 million. We had prepared, as a backup, to show a portion of my two-volume DVD \"Flying Saucers ARE Real\" with one -'1 20 MUFON UFO Journal November 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Left to right, Prof. Sun Shi-Li, chairman of the International Chinese UFO Association; Ms. Moon Fong, founder/chairman of Hong Kong UFO Club; Stanton Friedman; and Prof. Leu Yin-Jong, author, founder of Tai- wan UFO Research Association, and vice-chairman of the International Chinese UFO Association. of our team from Hong Kong translat- ing. The sound didn't work on the ma- chine. My microphone went out several times, so the translator couldn't hear me some of the time! We got through it. Interestingly, my paper, in Chinese translation, was given an award for ex- cellence. There was an interesting pa- per by Bill Chalker of Australia. The hotel wasn't as comfortable as the one at the City University of Hong Kong campus guest room in which I had stayed. I met lots of people from Japan, Taiwan, China, a woman from Israel, a Hungarian ufologist, etc. There were about 200 attendees. I believe the next world conference will be in two years in Hong Kong. There were printed English versions of several of the papers. Titles included \"Research and Analysis on Chinese Twist and Fan- Like UFO,\" \"On the Utility of Cosmic Energy and the Spaceflight Power,\" \"Unified Cosmic Model and Crop Field Hypothesis,\" \"The Exploration of Crop Circles,\" \"UFO History and Present Topicality in Hungary,\" and \"A Night Visit of the UFO to Hen Mountain.\" This latter case involved a number of military witnesses to what sounded from the written summary like a very intriguing case. I did stress, in a short opening ceremony presentation, the need for all of us to think of ourselves as Earthlings rather than with national- istic labels. I also noted that Canada is slightly larger than China, but has only one-fortieth as many people. Digital cameras and cell phones were everywhere. Some people had ob- viously seen videos of me, from their comments, and wanted their pictures taken with me. Again the press was quite friendly. Of course I heard far more English in Hong Kong, which had been under British rule for so long, than in Dalian. Our hosts gave us a very pleasant tour of Dalian. I was certainly impressed by the fact that, judging from business cards, there were a great many professional people involved in ufology in Taiwan and China. In some of the papers, various skeptics were noted, including James Oberg. The new Hong Kong Airport is one of the most impressive I have seen. It was not only very attractive to look at and walk through, and with great train service to town, but I was frankly much more comfortable there and at the Dalian Airport than I am these days in most North American airports. Getting through security, customs, and immigration was a breeze. I used my Canadian passport. Shoes were not removed. Everybody was courteous; no searches. There were even free meals on the China Air flights. Hong Kong was especially impres- sive, both as seen from a restaurant high up one of the mountains and from free- ways. There was sometimes dusty air pollution coming in from the mainland. Never have I seen so many 50 or more story buildings hi such a relatively small area. I didn't learn as much as I had hoped to about Chinese ufology, partly be- cause of the language problems in Dalian. There are conspiracy theorists in Asia as well as here. For example, many seemed to think that Dr. John Mack had been assassinated in Britain, rather than being a victim of a drunk driver. I explained that when I was in En- gland and in Hong Kong where people also drive on the left side of the road as opposed to the right side as in North America, I had to be very careful when walking not to look the wrong way when stepping off a curb. After returning to Canada I learned that the drunk driver involved had been sentenced to 15 months in prison, de- spite a plea for clemency from John's family, which apparently was also con- vinced that it was a very unfortunate accident. In Mainland China they drive on the right side-very aggressively at that. I was on nonstop flights from New- ark, NJ, to/from Hong Kong. These went by polar routes, including flying over Siberia, which felt rather strange: They lasted 15 hrs and 40 minutes, and were the longest flights I have ever taken. Fortunately the 777s were not full, so there was a little extra space. Would I go back to Hong Korig? I certainly hope I have the opportunity. Interestingly the Chinese UFO Society expects to be distributing about V4 mil- lion copies of its newsletter. For those who worry about such things, I should mention that even though the Communist Party runs China, it was certainly one of the most capitalistic places I have ever visited. Construction was everywhere. My wife and daughter, who were on a tour in China, at the same time coin- cidentally, but at different locations, thought the same thing. fsphys @ rogers.com November 2005 MUFON UFO Journal 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Director's Message (Continued from page 2) Directors (ASD), State Section Direc- tors (SSD), and Field Investigators (FI) are granted another level of access to the database so they may enter and up- date cases.

Wood, chair of the annual UFO Crash Retrieval Conference in Las Vegas. It is a landmark synthesis and review of every credible UFO crash retrieval event uncovered worldwide to date. He presents 74 UFO crashes dating from 1897 to the present, supported by compelling evidence in the form of of- ficial documents, eyewitnesses, and in some cases physical evidence. While every one of the cases may not prove to be of extraterrestrial ori- gin, Ryan has provided a body of tech- nological evidence that strongly sug- gests that vehicles not made on Earth have crashed here, and that some of them have been recovered.

McLeod December Sky Moon Phases: New Moon Dec. 1 First Quarter Dec. 8 Full Moon Dec. 15 Last Quarter Dec. 23 New Moon Dec. 31 Bright Planets (Evening Sky) Venus: Moving from Sagittarius into Capricornus. For northern hemisphere observers, Venus will set more than 2.5 hours after the Sun, and will stand about 10 degrees high in the southwest just before the end of evening twilight. For southern hemisphere observers, Venus will set about 2.5 hours after the Sun and will stand about 10 degrees high in the west-southwest at the end of evening twilight. Venus will be at its greatest brilliancy on Dec. 9. Mars: In Aries. For northern hemi- sphere observers, Mars will stand about 45 degrees high in the east-southeast at the end of evening twilight, transit about 60 degrees high before 9 PM, and will set in the west-northwest about 3.5 hours before sunrise. For southern hemisphere observers, Mars will stand about 45 degrees high on the meridian at the end of evening twilight, and will set near 2 AM in the west-north west. Bright Planets (Morning Sky) Mercury: Moving from Libra through Scorpius into Ophiuchus. Mer- cury will brighten as it slowly emerges in the morning twilight late in the month in the southeast sky. Jupiter: In Virgo. For northern hemisphere observers, Jupiter will im- prove in visibility in the predawn sky. At midmonth Jupiter will rise nearly 4 hours before the Sun in the east-south- east, and will stand nearly 20 degrees high in the southeast at the beginning of morning'twilight. Lessfayored southern hemisphere observers^will find Jupiter only about 10 degrees-high in the east at the be- ginning of .morning twilight. 24 Saturn: In Cancer. For northern hemisphere observers, Saturn will rise near 8 PM in the east-northeast, and will stand about 50 degrees high in the west-southwest at the beginning of morning twilight. For southern hemisphere observers, Saturn will rise near 10 PM in the east- northeast, and will stand more than 40 degrees high at the beginning of morn- ing twilight. Other Celestial Phenomena Dec. 21 (Tuesday): Winter Solstice (Marks the first day of winter for Earth's northern hemisphere, and first day of summer for the Southern hemi- sphere). Meteor Showers: Geminids: The annual Geminid me- teor shower will peak on the night of Dec. 13/14. This shower is one of the better showers, since as many as 100 meteors per hour may be seen. While this certainly doesn't rival the Leonids in recent years, this is still a very high rate for a regular meteor shower. This is an unusual shower in that the source of the shower is not believed to be a comet, but rather from an object known as 3200 Phaethon. This object is currently classified as an asteroid, but some scientists believe that it might be an extinct comet with a thick crust of interplanetary dust. Another thing that makes-the Geminids unusual is that one doesn't have to wait until after midnight to catch this shower. The radiant rises early and meteors can be seen around 10 PM lo- cal time, but the best view will still be after midnight local time. This shower also boasts a broad maximum, lasting nearly one whole day, so no matter where you live, you stand a decent chance of catching sight of some Geminids. The actual peak will occur around 04:00 UTC on the 14th (6:40 PM EST, 5:40 CST, 4:40 MST, and 3:40 PM PST on the 13th). MUFON UFO Journal Unfortunately the Moon will be near its full phase, so will greatly diminish the enjoyment in viewing the Geminids this year. Ursids: The Ursids peak on Dec. 22/ 23 and have a peak hourly rate of 10 or so, but in some years the hourly peak- has risen as high as 50. The Moon will be a problem-this year as it will be between its full-arid last quarter phases. • •' t Conjunctions and Occultatipns Dec. 4: Venus 2.0 degrees north of the Moon.
