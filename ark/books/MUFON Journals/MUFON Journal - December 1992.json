Sometimes, of course, it hides things to save its own neck and sometimes seemingly just for the hell of it. — Norman Maclean Young Men and Fire S poken like a true fortean or ufologist, but in fact Norman Maclean (d. 1990) is neither, at least not in any obvious sense. Indeed, you might know him better as the late retired University of Chicago English professor who wrote A River Runs Through It, recently turned into a motion picture by Robert Redford. Young Men and Fire, his second book, was published posthumously earlier this year. It's the culmination of Maclean's 16 year investigation into the August 1949, Mann Gulch Fire in which 13 National Forest Service firefighters died. Maclean knew it wouldn't be easy to reconstruct events nearly 40 years dead, but he must have been .surprised to discover that even a seemingly \"non-political\" agency like the Forest Service had its own reasons, or perceived reasons, for both slanting and hiding history and evidence. After all, 13 good men had died and several of the families had sued the Service for negligence. Even so, things were seemingly covered up or glossed over that needn't have been, including a 20 to 30 minute discrepancy in the time the men died. After all was said and done, Maclean seems to have come to the conclusion that covering its tracks is simply the way government does business. He tells his co-investigator, Laird Robinson, \"Maybe our trouble is we think they thought the difference [in the time of death] was important. Maybe we suffer from the belief that the game of cover-up is played only when there is something bad to cover up and only when the big boys play it. But for a lot of guys besides Nixon, it was a fun game, and all sizes, shapes and sexes are eligible to play it.\" There is some evidence for this point of view. Last year alone, for example, government censors classified over seven million documents, an average of 20,000 documents a day, according to Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Science and Secrecy conducted by the Federation of American Scientists. The Defense Department accounts for 61 percent of the country's secrets, the CIA for another 26 percent, the State Department only three percent. The se- crecy glut is troubling not only for what it means in terms of our supposedly democratic institutions, but in terms of hard Dr. Cameron had some unusual Ideas about the working of the human mind, ideas which closely dovetailed with the CIA's own closet Cold War thinking about the benefits of brainwashing and other forcible covert techniques of mind control. It was a dubi- ous combination at best — a fatal attrac- tion at worst. currency and international competition as well. For in- stance, with the effective end of the Cold War nearly at hand, the transfer of many military technologies to peaceful ones is imperative, both for domestic jobs and as a way of maintaining our pre-eminent position as the world's ad- vanced technology leader. Yet this process, among others, is seriously hampered by the government's innate and inbred tendencies toward paranoia and secrecy. Currently, some 6500 individuals in the executive establishment have the power to classify secrets on their own say so and nothing else. The cost of maintaining all these secrets is prohibitive, too, probably running to several billion dollars a year according to some estimates. \" ^Tobody knows, fundamentally, how many secrets there •IN are,\" Tom Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, a private non-profit library of declassified docu- ments, recently told the Orlando Sentinel. Millions of documents are declassified annually, but they add up to a few drops of water in a very big bucket. At the National Archives alone, for instance, officials estimate that they have a backlog of 325 million pages of documents awaiting declassification — all created before 1962! So it doesn't seem too far-fetched too assume that among the many millions of pages of currently classified documents, more than a mere handful or two must almost assuredly deal with reports of UFOs. In fact, some sense of what is kept secret can be gleaned by what actually gets out. On November 18 of this year, for example, the Canadian government suddenly reversed a standing seven-year policy and agreed to compensate the surviving victims of a CIA- sponsored psychiatric program that essentially turned sev- eral minds to mush and left long-lasting psychic scars on others. The depressing details can be found in the New York Times for November 19, 1992. Portions of the story were first leaked to the public in a 1979 book, The Search for the Manchurian Candidate (find a copy if you can!), by John Marks, a former Senate aide and State Department official, and co-author with Victor Marchetti of The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Marks was working with 16,000 pages of CIA documents released MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"under the Freedom of Information Act. Subtitled \"The CIA and Mind Control,\" the portion of the Manchurian Candidate which concerns us here deals with one Dr. D. Ewen Cameron, at the time (the 1950's) the head of the Allan Memorial Institute, an originally Rockefeller-funded psychiatric clinic operated under the auspices of McGill University in Mon- treal. The Canadian government in Ottawa supported Cameron's subsequent psychological experiments to the tune of some $200,000, while the CIA, under the auspices of a cover organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, chipped in another $60,000. Cameron and the Allan Institute were highly regarded by the psychological community. In 1953, he was elected president of the American Psychiatric Association; later he would be chosen the first president of the World Psychiatric Association. According to Marks, \"His friends joked that they had run out of honors to give him.\" Cameron had some unusual ideas about the working of the human mind, ideas which closely dovetailed with the CIA's own in-house thinking about brainwashing. Some of these suppositions had partly played themselves out in projects ARTICHOKE and MKULTRA, which involved the administration (to unwitting victims) of LSD and other mind-altering drugs. Purportedly, this was Cold War hys- teria at its highest. Concerned about mind control tech- niques reportedly employed on American POW's by the Chinese in the course of the Korean \"police action,\" the CIA and other government agencies were determined to gain the upper hand. What followed would be eventually dismissed as an excess of patriotic enthusiasm. A pparently, Cameron thought that the human mind could be erased, or \"de-patterned,\" in much the same way that one wipes a chalkboard clean before writing a new equation. To wipe his own patients' slates clean, Cameron employed both electroshock and drug \"therapy,\" followed up by the constant replaying of voiced tape-overs, the speakers for which might be hidden under their pillows or in the walls of their room. It goes without saying that the majority of Cameron's participants in this partially CIA-funded experi- ment were anything but witting volunteers; for the most part, they were innocent victims who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Marks claims that more than half of Cameron's human guinea pigs emerged from his \"treatment\" process with their memory and/or mental health seriously impaired. Linda Macdonald, 55, and now a Vancouver employment coun- selor, said she \"walked through those doors with a husband on one arm and a guitar on the other ... healthy ... and coherent.\" Diagnosed as an acute schizophrenic by Cameron, she spent 86 days in his so-called \"sleep room,\" subjected to 109 shock treatments and megadoses of barbiturates and other drugs. Afterward, Macdonald said she could neither read nor write, nor could she remember anything of the first Cameron thought the human mind could be \"de-patterned.\" Given enough electro- shock and barbiturates, he proved to be right. 26 years of her life, including her husband and five children. She even had to be toilet-trained again. Another unfortunate victim was Velma Orlikow, the now-deceased wife of David Orlikow, a retired member of the Canadian Parliament. According to the Times, Orlikow said his wife emerged from Cameron's treatment \"a dis- abled person, not physically but emotionally ... She was a very intelligent person [before] but her ability to read was destroyed.\" In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department announced an out- of-court settlement with Mrs. Orlikow and eight other survivors of Cameron's experiments in the amount of $750,000. The Canadian capitulation seems to be based on the American settlement; in effect Ottawa agreed to pay some 80 surviving claimants a total of $80,000 each. Still, Canada denies ultimate responsibility, admitting only that the compensation \"expresses the fairness and compassion Canadian expect from their Government.\" It was generally assumed that a further airing of the Cameron and CIA dirty laundry would only harm the re-election chances of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his present precarious major- ity in Parliament, so the government elected to settle up. \"It's a sad episode that happened more than 3.0 years ago,\" CIA spokesman John Hedley told the Times, \"and the case is closed,\" a statement we are supposed to take on faith. And so it goes — in terms of the Forest Service, psychiatry, the CIA, international relations, and advanced technology — and no doubt with regard to the troublesome business of UFOs as well. \"Sometimes,\" said Maclean, the government \"hides things to save its own neck and some- times seemingly just for the hell of it.\" But when it comes to UFOs, given the current un- changed climate of secrecy, how will we ever know with certainty which is which?

Typed onto a red-edged label, attached to the lower left of the envelope, were these words, arranged in two lines: \"CON- FIDENTIAL, RE: BROOKLYN BRIDGE.\" The reference immediately piqued my curiosity. Since the previous February, I had been investigating the \"Linda Cortile\" abduction case, an incident which had occurred within sight of the Brooklyn Bridge and which had appar- ently been witnessed by a well-known political figure and two security men parked nearby.* For obvious reasons, these men desired confidentiality and had so far declined to meet with me in person. However, they had vividly described to me, in letters and an audio cassette tape, what they had seen from their location beneath the FDR Drive: A UFO hovering above a nearby building, a woman in a white nightgown and three small, non-human figures suspended in a beam of bluish-white light, twelve stories above the ground, and the final elevation of these four into the underside of the craft. The craft had then come towards their car, passing over the FDR Drive and finally plunging into the East River \"behind (i.e. south of) the Brooklyn Bridge.\" The men stated that the encounter had taken place in late November 1989, between 3:00 and 3:30 a.m., and that they had been profoundly unnerved as they watched the event unfold. It had occurred quickly. First, the UFO lowered itself above the building, and then the four figures popped out of an apartment window in, as the men put it, \"the fetal position.\" Next, the four arranged themselves in a vertical pattern: two aliens below, the \"girl or woman\" above, and the third alien above her. Simultaneously, \"as if on cue,\" they unrolled into standing positions, and then, \"as if on an invisible elevator,\" all four rose up into the underside of the craft. In my several interviews and single hypnotic regression session with Linda, the central figure in this case, I discov- ered that she had, with a few exceptions, remembered the same sequence of events that the government people had reported to me. One notable difference was that, once out- side the window, she had been staring straight ahead, im- mobilized in some kind of altered state, so she apparently did not see the three aliens hovering in the light above and * \"The' Linda Cortile' Abduction Case,\" MUFON UFO Journal, No. 293, Septem- ber 1992, pp. 12-16. beneath her. (She had remembered encountering them in- side her apartment, escorting her to the window, but then her memory becomes unclear.) Neither did she recall having been rolled up in a fetal position, yet otherwise the basic congruity of her account, with that of the three men, was remarkable. Naturally, Linda had no idea of the UFO's route once she was inside it; she was shocked when I informed her the men said the craft plunged into the East River \"behind the Brooklyn Bridge.\" As I held the envelope in my hand that November afternoon and looked at the words \"CONFIDENTIAL, RE: BROOKLYN BRIDGE,\" I barely allowed myself to hope that this letter and Linda's abduction might be somehow connected, that its writer might provide more evidence about the event. The envelope contained a cover letter and photocopies of three drawings, all hand-colored, and an earlier letter. I read the cover letter first: Dear Mr. Hopkins: The enclosed letter and drawings dated July 17, 1991, are copies of the originals I have sent to you last July. I expected some form of response from you by now, because the sighting took place in your own city. I've seriously considered the possibility that the originals I've sent to you were lost somewhere in the Post Office long ago. If I don't hear from you, then I'll assume you are aware of the goings on in New York City. Thank you.   Sincerely, Janet Kimble T he name \"Janet Kimble\" is a pseudonym I've invented; the actual letter writer gave me her real name, home address and home telephone number. (A later search through my box of unopened correspondence turned up the July letter and the original crayon drawings.) The letter reads as follows: Dear Mr. Hopkins, My name is Janet. I'm a middle aged woman and retired. Some time last May, CBS aired a one hour show entitled \"Visitors From the Unknown.\" I watched the show because it just so happened to be on my TV set at the time I walked into the room. From that evening on, I thought about what I saw in New York City about 1 [and] 112 years ago, more than I have ever thought about itbefore.It's disturbing to me. I was getting along just fine until that show aired. During the course of this year and a half, I spoke of what I saw only once and was made to feel ridiculous. I have never spoken of it again. In fact, I have never traveled back to New York City after what I saw and I never will again, for any reason.

On the other hand, I'm feeling some relief. Please let me explain how I found you. The day after the show aired, I was determined to find someone I could tell about what I saw, but I couldn't tell just anyone. I have never read anything on the UFO subject (maybe I should have). However, I knew that books were written on the subject, so 1 went to the local bookstore. There I quickly paged through many UFO books and liked the sound of your name. I read a little of what you wrote in your book entitled Intruders, and it piqued my interest. I'm sorry I didn't buy your book, but I will in the future, as soon as I calm down. J anet explained in her letter, and in later conversations, a sequence of events in which she phoned my publisher for my address and was told that, though my address could not be given out, the receptionist thought I lived in New York. The next paragraph of Janet's letter contained a pair of oddly formal capitalized wordings which caught my attention. Unlike most people, she avoided the simple terms \"informa- tion\" and \"phone book.\" / called Manhattan Directory Assistance, asking if a Budd, spelled with two D's, Hopkins was listed somewhere in NYC, and she said yes! Had she said no, I would have forgotten about this letter, rendering my situation with what I saw hopeless. I went out to find the Manhattan White Pages and found your address in there. J'II feel humiliated if this letter is received by the wrong Budd Hopkins. I'm sure you won't be contacting me, but if you do, you'll find my phone number at the end of this letter. I do wish to remain anon- ymous. My family and friends do not take too kindly to the UFO subject. I have had first hand experience and I refuse to be made into a fool. It has taken me two months to build up the courage to write you this letter and draw the enclosed drawings. I don' t want to be involved with these unnatural goings on. How- ever, I must know, if you know, what is going on in NYC and if it happens often? One Wednesday evening, November 29, 1989, I at- tended a retirement party in Brooklyn for my sickly boss. The party lasted into the early hours of the next morning, Thursday, November 30, 1989, exactly one week from Thanksgiving Day. My boss invited me to stay at her house for the night, but I was anxious to get home. I drove to the Brooklyn Bridge, with the intention of crossing over to the Manhattan side, to drive to the FDR Drive to go home from there. I drove more than halfway across the bridge, when my car came to a slow, but dead, stop. I was so upset. It was about 3:00 in the morning, and I wanted to get home. I saw my headlights dim and then go out. None of the car lights worked after that. I didn't know what went wrong. I was afraid to get out of the car, because it was so dark up there on the bridge. I didn't want to get hit by an oncom- ing car, nor did I want to get mugged if my car wasn' t hit. I looked through the rearview mirror to see if other cars were coming, and they were. This scared me half to death, because they had no way of seeing my car parked. But their head-lights dimmed out, too, and their cars stopped, right behind mine. I just couldn't understand the strange coincidence, and I still don't. How could anything get stranger than this? From the corner of my right eye, on the passenger side of the front seat window, I thought I saw a building on fire in Manhattan. The whole sky lit up. Mr Hopkins, words can't express what I saw that morning up on the Brooklyn Bridge. I can't begin to explain it verbally. You would have had to of seen it yourself. Enclosed please find three drawings and one flap draw- ing taped to Drawing #2, explaining what I saw. You can have them. These pictures will always be in my mind. These drawings are of myself watching what was going on from the bridge as I sat in my car. After you finish looking through this little package I managed to send to you, you may think I'm crazy. If I am, so were all the other people sitting in their cars up there on the bridge with me that morning. If you don't think I'm crazy and you have questions, I can only say what I saw, and I know what I saw. DRAWING # 1 — From the corner of my eye, I thought a building was on fire. I was shocked to see what it really was. The lights were so bright, I had to shield my eyes. I was frightened and found this aircraft very threatening. DRAWING #2 (Flap Drawing) — They came out of a window, one, right after another, (second window from left). There were six windows on that side of the building. I purposely counted them. There was enough light for thou- sands of people to see what was happening. I'll bet you dollars to donuts that thousands did see what happened from other areas of the city. I didn 't know what they were because they were all rolled up into little balls. DRAWING # 2 (Lift Flap)—I didn' t want to look. I was petrified, but something made me look and I saw the balls unroll at the same time. It wasn't until then I realized that they were 4 children standing up in mid air. Yes, in mid air! While I watched, I could hear the screams of the people parked in their cars behind me. Their screams were from horror. They sounded like I felt. Please excuse the stick figures I drew in this drawing, but this is honestly how I saw three of the children. It was obvious that these children were rickets-stricken. Their heads were so large compared to the normal girl-child standing in the air with them. I don't know what gender the three sickly children were, but I could see that the normal child was a girl-child, because she was wearing some sort of a white gown. I would imagine that it was a white nightgown she was wearing, because of the early hour of the morning. She was taller than the others. Perhaps she was a little MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"bit older? Maybe she was a porcelain mannequin? I don't know, because I didn't see her move, except to change position. Remember, I was far away, but close enough to see what they were and what was going on. I may not have seen anything if it weren't for the bright lights. Their next movement was when they all moved up closer to the craft. Then they quickly wished straight up into the object (underneath it) and disappeared! DRAWING #3 — The aircraft quickly rose up above the building and flew away at a very fast speed. A speed I have never seen before. It flew behind the building drawn on the right. It passed over a highway, or drive, below and then proceeded to climb higher, over the center of the bridge. I was parked more towards the Manhattan side of the bridge. I watched in horror. I don't know where it went from there, because I had to look up to see. There was a bridge platform [pedestrian walkway] above and I couldn't see anymore. I do know that when this UFO passed over the bridge, my clothing clung to me and my body hair stood up. The clinging sensation went away after the object went away, and my car started again. Mr. Hopkins, I wanted to talk to the people parked behind me. I was very shaken up and could of used some calming down, but they were much too upset themselves, and I couldn't communicate with them. Some of them were running all around their cars with theirs hands on their heads, screaming from horror and disbelief. I was feeling bad enough without having to see these poor people in worse shape than I. So I took off and drove home. I have often wondered what became of these poor children. It all happened so fast. It happened suddenly and finished suddenly. It felt good sharing this with you, but I don't think I will ever share this with anyone again. It's just too unbelievable. Are you aware of what is going on in that dreadful city? Is anyone putting a stop to this? Mr. Hopkins, I thank you. Sincerely, Janet Kimble A t the end of her remarkable letter, Janet typed in her phone number and this instruction: Call any day (except Wednesdays) from 9 AM to 4 PM. I telephoned her imme- diately and began a careful investigation of her claims. Eve- rything about her account reinforced the description of Linda's abduction I had received from the other three wit- nesses parked beneath the FDR Drive. The emotions Janet expressed ran true. The only odd verbal note in her letter was the formality of her terms \"Manhattan Directory Assis- tance\" (instead of \"Information\") and \"Manhattan White Pages\" (instead of \"phone book\"). When I first inquired into her background and employment, I learned that she had worked for years as a telephone operator; the formal usages were therefore quite natural, and the issue dissipated. In the course of several phone conversations, and one hours-long, face to face, interview, she answered every question I asked with complete openness, accuracy and appropriate emotion. For the sake of brevity, I will telescope these conversations and present the most important infor- mation and the specific direct quotes which bear on this case. Janet Kimble is a widow of about sixty, a mother and a new grandmother. At the time it occurred, she related what she had seen the morning of Nov. 30 only to her son, her daughter, her sister and her brother-in-law, and since her brother-in-law is the town supervisor, she is very careful to whom she tells her story. Yet even her own family members were dubious. \"My children, and my sister and brother-in- law asked me, 'What were they drinking at that party?' \" She told me her first reaction to the events she was seeing: \"The huge, bright lights made me think they were making a movie.\" The entire experience, as we tried, to- gether, to reconstruct it in real time, might have lasted for as long as three minutes, but was more likely to have taken place in considerably less time — perhaps a minute or a minute and a half. As we sat together, I asked Janet to close her eyes and picture to herself the UFO's arrival, the four \"balls\" tumbling out the window, unrolling into standing positions, and then lifting up into the craft. I counted out the seconds as she did so; this part of the encounter probably lasted only about twelve seconds. The UFO's subsequent flight behind a building, and then up over the bridge, could not, I believe, have lasted much longer than a minute, and possibly much less. Things did happen quickly. J anet's actions followed this sequence: After her engine died and the car began to coast to a stop, her headlights and the lights illuminating the roadway began to dim, re- minding her of \"when we had the famous [1965 northeast] blackout.\" Alarmed, she tried to find out what time it was, an act which required taking her cigarette lighter out of her purse and lighting it so she could see her watch. It was 3:16 a.m. She realized this could not be a city-wide blackout, since her car lights had also dimmed out. \"But then, (whis- pering nervously) when I saw (the floating figures) my first impression was, \"They're making a movie. What are they, crazy? What did they do to the bridge? What happened to all these cars?'... It didn't look real.\" She said that she thought the film they were making might be \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\" She thought also of the little \"vegetable people\" in the TV commercials for the Jolly Green Giant, explaining it this way: \"Because he stands so tall against these little people, and they look funny. They don't look like real people. I'm telling you, it was so weird. I thought it was a movie, but, you know, there were no lights, the car died. I thought they 're using some kind of equipment for this movie that's knocked everything out. And then I thought I must be crazy ... I have to be ... you know, this isn't real.\" I commented on the accuracy of her drawings. \"Yes, because I kept staring, and look, I was watching a movie MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"being filmed in New York.\" I asked if she remembered deliberately counting the windows in the interest of accu- racy. \"I was saying to myself, If I tell somebody this, they'll never beiieve me. It's a terrible thing to be alone. There's nobody to say, 'Oh, my God, look at this!' or 'what could it be?' or something. I'm saying to myself, 'How could I tell somebody this?' I just kept kind of concentrating on them. I remember saying to myself 'There's only one window in the corner there, and they're not coming out of that window. They're coming out of the next. It looks like there's four more windows there.' I was so directed on that spot that I really couldn't tell you what was happening beneath that. There's that particular row of windows and that little cap on top that you told me was a water tower ...\" I decided to test Janet's visual memory, to make abso- lutely certain she had made the drawings as she claimed. I took out a pad of paper and a pen and asked her if she would re-draw the facade of Linda's building. Without hesitation, she rendered the side of the building with its six windows, the smaller penthouse floor above it, and, crowning the structure, the square housing of the water tower. Her memory was obviously accurate and her drawing style the same as the drawings she'd originally sent me. e returned to her memories of the event as it unfolded. VV \"First it looked like an explosion almost. Because it was so red and white ... that's what caught me, and then the red subdued and it got white ... (whispering) 'What the heck is this?' And the light from underneath, it was like sharp, where the rays were coming down, but then it got like a haze as it went down ... \"Then I saw these balls ... they all just tumbled out. And from a distance I thought it was a little girl ... but you know, I'm glad you told me that this was seen by other people, so it definitely wasn't a movie, or some kind of flim-flam thing. And it looked like they all tumbled out, and they all unrolled ... unravelled.\" I tried, deliberately, to lead Janet, or rather to m/slead her. I asked, \"Did one unravel and then the next one unravel and then the next one?\" \"No,\" she replied, and became thoughtful, searching for the right image. \"It kinda looked like ... let's see ... like those commercials when they sprinkle water on flower buds and all of a sudden the flowers open? That's what it looked like. To be honest with you, it's silly looking ... it couldn't have been real. I'm telling you what I'm thinking at the moment, while I'm looking. This is so silly looking ... and then ... I was thinking of Peter Pan. I expected everybody was going to go like this any minute (moves her hands in flitting, flying motions). And then all of a sudden they were moving up under the bottom ... it started moving up. It was red ... a big ball of fire ...\" Next, we discussed the UFO's apparent size, and Janet stated that it was wider than the side of the building. From that I explored issues of time, her drive home, and so on. But in a moment she brought up the CBS program which had caused her to write to me. This conversation was extremely interesting, because she had been struck by the differences between the three abduction cases dealt with on the pro- gram, and her own experience as a witness. \"Both of those people (Mike Rogers in the Travis Walton case and John Salter) were driving pickup trucks ... the gentleman that's a professor and the lumberjacks. They both had pickup trucks. The policeman (Alan Godfrey) had a car. And I noticed, 'cause I was looking for it... how come their lights were on and their motors were going? And the policeman's flash- light was on? He was, you know, dazzled, but those lumber- jacks turned their pickup truck around and went back. And, like, I felt the same thing they felt. Fear. It's normal to be afraid of the unknown. That professor (Salter) said every- body (the group of aliens) was very friendly. Well, let me tell you something, if any strange creatures start punching needles in me, no they're not friendly. How could you say unknown is friendly? And he is a learned man! \"And the thing that puzzled me was how come this (the Brooklyn Bridge incident) happened? Those three incidents were in rural areas and this was in the city! I'm saying to myself, 'Other people had to see it.' New York never sleeps.\" Janet went on to describe the initial reactions of those on the bridge when their cars stopped. \"It occurred to every- body, 'What the hell is going on? Move that car!' And then it was, 'Oh, my God! What the hell is that? There are people in the air!' When somebody yelled it — and I can't even tell you if it was a man or a woman — I thought, all right, I'm not seeing things. These other people are seeing the same thing.\" Janet had a few questions she wanted to ask me, one of which brought up something extremely interesting, which I had never even considered. She wanted to know how the strange creatures found their way into the apartment build- ing, since she had not seen them going in — only coming out as little rolled-up balls. I could not answer her question; it had not crossed my mind. It is an interesting question, indeed. It suggests once more that the latter part of the abduction was deliberately made visible, staged, as it were, for the three men in the car below, while the beginning, the entrance of the aliens into Linda's apartment building, was like that of so many other bedroom visitations, magically \"unseeable.\" I shall return to this theme in a moment. One other detail of Janet's account interested me in particular. In many car-stopping UFO cases, witnesses report that the car engine simply dies and then suddenly starts up again, spontaneously, after the incident is over, either sec- onds or hours later. I asked Janet if, once the UFO passed over her and disappeared from sight, her car engine started up again spontaneously. \"No,\" she replied, \"I had it turned off. Thinking it was mechanical (when it first happened), I immediately shut everything off. I shut the headlights off.\" She explained that after the UFO incident, the first thing MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"to let her know that her car was functioning normally was this: \"The inside light went on ... It went on because I had first opened the door and I guess I didn't really close it all the way, 'cause the (dome) light went on.\" Much, much more transpired during the interview in Janet's hometown, and in our various telephone calls. Each recollection and emotional reaction was appropriate and consistent with her personality and background, and her observations echoed those of the three other witnesses in the car beneath the FDR Drive. One of the key aspects of this extraordinary case is the fact that a UFO abduction was observed at all, by anyone. Virtually all abductions are witnessed only by other participants — friends, family members, and so on, as in the classic Hill abduction. Y et, built into this case is a plausible reason why at least some independent witnesses were allowed to watch the abduction unfold; the UFO occupants apparently wanted at least one of the witnesses, an important political figure, to see the event take place. It is as if they were announcing, \"see what we can do? We're real, we're here, and we can do this anytime we wish.\" Of the four people who've reported seeing Linda Cortile floating in mid-air beneath a hovering UFO, all attest to the presence that night of other witnesses who have not yet contacted me. Do these other people presently remember what they saw, or are their memories being blocked in a pattern UFO researchers have found to be so common? Are they just afraid to come forward, or self- doubting, or literally unable, now, to remember? At any rate, the witnesses I've heard from all report the theatrical nature of the abduction drama. Janet thought immediately of a movie being made, while one of the men in the car down below described the sight as \"the greatest light show\" he'd ever seen. I've investigated many abductions which took place in New York City, some of which occurred during daylight hours, yet they were all apparently (and magically) unseen. In one nighttime case, the UFO hovered above a rooftop with all of its lights off; the abductee reported being floated up into a dark, circular mass that would have been virtually impossible to see from the street. And yet the Linda Cortile abduction was as hyper-visible as one can imagine, with the witnesses feeling that hundreds, or even thousands, of people, even at 3:15 a.m., should have seen it. The inference is inescapable — the incident was a deliberate display of UFO power and being. One of the first things I did after I received Janet's letter was to drive across the Brooklyn Bridge at about 3:00 a.m. to see what she could have seen. The traffic was very light — perhaps three or four other cars were on the bridge at the time — and Linda's building was clearly visible some distance away. I was able to count the individual windows, and could even see the air conditioners in some of them. (The distance was later determined to be approximately 1560 feet.) With the intensely bright light the witnesses reported streaming from the UFO, visibility would have been no problem. Since I could easily make out the windows, I had them measured to give myself a comparative unit. They are 55 inches high, but Linda is 65 inches tall. Standing in front of them, she would have been taller than the windows and, because of her very full, floor-length nightgown, she might seem even wider. Watching this distant, but astonishing, scene, Janet could not tell if the gowned figure was a child, a woman or a mannequin, though she thought the three others, once they unrolled, must be \"sickly children.\" Or, ironically, the four might be \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs!\" ~ At each step of the way, I've been checking and re- checking each detail of this extraordinarily important case as it emerged through the testimony of the many witnesses. As an example, there are two identical descriptions of what we may regard as electromagnetic (E-M) effects. Janet Kimble, from her position on the bridge, and the government agents beneath the FDR drive each reported their automo- bile engines dying and their lights going out before either saw the UFO. It was only after they had begun to deal with this unsettling occurrence that the UFO appeared, suggest- ing a deliberate, selective procedure on the part of the UFO occupants. (Were they, perhaps, carefully setting the stage and preparing the audience for their demonstration?) The sensations of \"static cling\" and of their body hair standing on end, reported by Janet Kimble and by the men below the FDR Drive, were not felt until the UFO passed very close to each car in turn. This two-stage, two-part E-M effect dem- onstrates again the subtle consonance between the two witness accounts. I have presented to the public to date about ten percent of the evidence in this case; all will eventually be made known in full. As we've seen, Janet Kimble's testimony supports in virtually every detail the testimony of the two government agents and the political figure in the car below. Her account also buttresses Linda's recollections, as well as the testimony of another witness who, from a location farther up the East River, saw what was apparently the same orange-red UFO, at the same hour on Nov. 30, 1989. In the ensuing days, weeks and months, four other individuals reported seeing, at close hand, and three even speaking with, the government agents involved in this case. But, as I said in my earlier piece, the very nature and importance of this encounter will mark it as an essential target for assault. The usual, tired old \"official\"debunkers have already risen to the attack, dutifully spreading the usual lies, trashing reputa- tions and sowing doubts. There are signs that more insidious disinformation agents are also busy. Sadly, it will only get worse before it gets better. Janet Kimble saw Linda Cortile in that beam of light as Snow White, an accidental, but apt, description of her natural innocence and unspoiled charac- ter. Unfortunately, Linda and the rest of us will soon be seeing and hearing from a disheartening array of intellectual and ethical dwarfs, trampling the truth beneath their muddy little feet.

According to Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt, several humanoid bodies were also discovered at another nearby crash site (1). The Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR) subsequently suc- ceeded in interviewing 28 witnesses (26 filmed on video, and two giving statements by phone) who claimed to have witnessed various aspects of this affair (2). This represents the most credible data yet supporting the main event of the modern \"UFO era.\" Still, little research has been conducted in the area of the potential impact such an event might have had on American government policy and the initiatives it might have provoked. Worst Possible Consequences I was a cryptographer in a headquarters of the French Airborne in Algeria in 1956 (during the war in this country). I recall that General Massu said to his staff: \"Please don't forget: when a situation of crisis occurs, we military people must foresee the worst possible consequences.\" In 1986,1 had the opportunity to chat with a retired General of the French Air Force. I asked: \"General, if the French Army discovered a UFO with its occupants after a crash, and it concluded that it was a spaceship with aliens, what would the military do?\" Without hesitation, he replied, \"I think the French government would advise all the main world governments, because we are compelled to foresee the worst possible situation, an invasion of Earth, for instance.\" Therefore, I suppose that in July of 1947, the American military (and its civilian government) would probably have reacted in exactly this same manner. July 1947 W ere any far-ranging policy initiatives undertaken in the weeks or months immediately following the so- called Roswell Incident? In fact, a check of the available records shows that on July 26, 1947, the National Security Council was created by the National Security Act (3). So far as I was able to ascertain, this was the first time in U.S. history that such a decision was made in peace time! Even when the Japanese Air Force bombed Pear Harbor on December 7,1941, nothing like the National Security Council was set up. In this context, it may be interesting to note that as of July, 1947, the U.S. was the only country on Earth to have manufactured nuclear weapons; the U.S.S.R. didn't make its first A-bomb until the summer of 1949, two years later. In addition, this selfsame National Security Council created an enormous infrastructure of similar security agen- cies, in particular the famous (or infamous) Central Intelli- gence Agency, headed by Rear Admiral Roscoe. H. Hillenkoetter. On September 19,1947, Admiral Hillenkoetter requested that the National Security Council (NSC) create a new Intelligence Advisory Committee (IAC). This new agency was established by NSC Directive No. 1 (3). In consulting all the American documents obtained by differ- ent researchers under the auspices of the FOIA, we find a copy of an IAC memorandum dated 9-21-57, titled: \"Un- identified Fly ing Objects Reported on 20 September 1957,\" and directed from the IAC to several secondary government agencies, including the Atomic Energy Commission, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the FBI, Army, Air Force, and the CIA (4). This is a serious indication that the IAC might have been created in response to the UFO problem. Moreover, even though the CIA was already active, an Office of Scientific Intelligence was also created (this had nothing to do with another OSI - the Office of Special Investigation - created by the Air Technical Intelligence Center of the USAF). According to four papers obtained through the FOIA, the existence of the OSI as a CIA agency is proven (5). Better still, a directive from the NSC says of UFOs that \"The Director of Central Intelligence shall for- mulate and carry out a program of intelligence and research activities as required to solve the problem of instant positive identification of unidentified flying objects [...] (6)\" What Did Truman Mean? O n October 30, 1947, Harry S. Truman wrote in his personal diary: \"2. The military implication of a satelite [sic] attack: a) Do we need a plan to meet this? b) Should we proceed to make one? (7)\" I have obtained a copy of the handwritten page of the President's diary from the Harry S. Truman Library, Independence Missouri, as submitted to this journal's editor (8). From a linguistic point of view, there is little reason to think that President Truman meant \"satellite country of the USSR,\" because there is no evi- dence that any of these countries would be in a position to attack the USA. In 1947, the countries in question were occupied by the USSR. In addition, much of the same area had been destroyed during World War II and was still under reconstruction. Equally important, the internal domestic turmoil of these countries was considerable, resulting in more immediate concerns other than that of attacking some trans-Atlantic \"enemy.\" So, however absurd it might seem at first blush, we must at least consider the notion that by \"satellite\" President MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Truman actually meant an orbital spaceship, even though the firstEarth satellite, Sputnik I, wouldn't be launched until 1957, or ten years after Truman first used the phrase. Other \"Underground\" Groups: According to the American author, David Wise, the National Security Council was composed of the following five members: the President and Vice-President of the USA, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State and the Director of the Office of Emergency Planning OEP (9). The director of the OEP was the Director of Central Intelligence (or the Director of the CIA). As Edward Ruppelt, former head of Project Blue Book wrote: \"By the end of July 1947, the UFO security lid was down tight\" (10). This corresponds perfectly with the birth of the NSC on the 26th of July 1947. Authority 10/2, the first group of \"invisible power,\" was created on June 18,1948 (or Instance 10/2, according to the French translation of my American source). This group was established with the Directive 10/2 of the NSC, which permitted the CIA to conduct political secret operations (11). My source did not claim that these secret operations were also covers for other kinds of disinformation about the UFO problem, but it is possible to speculate on that. On June 20, 1949, Authority 10/2 was replaced by Authority 10/5 (12). In 1954, this group was changed to another \"invisible group of power,\" having a new name formed with two numbers: 54/12. Five persons were in this group, among them was the Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence (11). In 1964, the 54/12 group was replaced by a Committee 303 (11). Following that, in 1970, Committee 40 was created, and, in 1976, President Gerald Ford replaced Committee 40 with the CFI, or Committee on Foreign Intelligence (All this information comes from the same source [11]). All of these groups, Authority 10/2, Authority 10/5, 54/12, Committee 303, Committee 40, and the CFI were secret executive groups of the American State power structure. IAC was a secret advisory group, like the others which followed: United States Intelligence Board, USIB, in 1964, and the Operations Advisory Group, OAG, in 1976 (12). Another subset of this \"invisible\" power structure may have been founded under Ronald Reagan, but up to now I haven't discovered the least clue about it. Perhaps my American colleagues will be induced to conduct more research in this area. Conclusion: A s I have written previously, the discovery of a flying saucer and its alien passengers in New Mexico, in July of 1947, may have induced the American Government and President Truman to notify all the major foreign powers of the Earth of a seemingly imminent invasion, if for no other reason than the already expressed duty of the military establishment \"to foresee the worst situation.\" In light of such an attitude, it's not too far-fetched to assume that the U.S. would notify its major allies ... and perhaps even its main adversaries, the USSR and Red China included. As far as the Pentagon was concerned, the benefits of such an \"unholy alliance\" would well have outweighed any other operant considerations or apprehensions. For similar reasons, the \"Cold War\" itself, including the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, viz. Star Wars, etc.), may have been a partial public deception. One could even speculate that this behavior permitted the USA and USSR to intensify the world's weapons market, not to mention global commerce, industry, etc... In my future books (13), I will elaborate, with numerous other details, the possible reasons for the UFO crash near Roswell, and why its \"passengers\" may also have been a part of this manipulation.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Question of Hypnosis and Creativity in Abduction Reports Mythic, Artistic, and Visionary Imagery in Altered,States of Consciousness by Edward Carlos T his article was initiated by reading Ann Druffel's \"Resisting Alien Abductions: An Update,\" Sean Casteel's \"Jacques Vallee & Joseph Campbell,\" and Ginna Meyer's \"Abductee Memory Loss,\" all.essays which appeared in the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 287, for March 1992. Joseph Campbell's writing on mythology and cultural images corroborates Carl Gustav Jung's notion of arche- typal patterns in cultural societal-behaviorial roles, and Campbell's insights reflect this Jungian emphasis. As magnificent as Campbell's writing is, however (and while as voluminous and reflective in his productivity as Jung), he does not appear to be concerned with the psychological nu- ances of imagery in the creative process. Rather, his own valid intellectual approach is anthropological and sociologi- cal in nature; myth seems cultural rather than psychological. From my own readings, I concur with Sean Casteel's commentary about the interview in which Joseph Campbell states that he had reflected little on the phenomenon of UFOs. Resistance and deceptions, such as \"screen-images\" within experiences which prompt imagery for artists, are as plausible to artistic or shamanic forms and cultural rituals as is the viability of belief systems to intellectual, theological, or philosophical pursuits. Perhaps similar mythic contents, with similar plausibilities, resistances, deceptions and spe- cious or otherwise credible truths, underlie the myth of science as well. A psychic image directly imprinted within an individual' s experience will augment reception. Otherwise, credibility is more intangible in a belief system and interest flows to other realizations within the myth, such as narrative description as in Campbell's case. Experience induces psychic, meta- phoric imagery which in turn flows through the creative, sensual veins, albeit to art forms. Artists throughout history have been prolific in dissemi- nating visual-sensual-perceptual experiences and concep- tual excercises within art images which are suggestive of spiritual, psychological, dream, visionary, transformative, or other altered states of consciousness. Pictures which illustrate dream-sensory experiences, or concepts of dreams, are scattered throughout our various cultural or mythologi- cal histories. They involve recurring motifs such as pictures of dionysian revelers, druidic faeries, and Christian-Piscean angels. There are illustrations of flying machines, strange evocative creatures partially human, such as satyrs and mermaids, and abstract imagery of visual solarization (as experienced in meditation and hypnotic states and as de- scribed in Jean Paul Sartre's What is Imagination). Metaphors, myths, and metaphysics are the soul of such imagery. But many other \"monsters\" appear in artistic images as well. Witness Byron Raskin's \"The War of the Worlds\" (1953) and more recent films like Steven Spielberg's \"E.T.\" and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" Ridley Scott's \"Alien\" and James Cameron's \"Aliens.\" Deception and self-deception may be part of the mem- ory aspects of the body's sensory or perceptual experience, i.e., memory, for whatever reasons of self-protection or other, sees reality from its own individual sufferance. This may or may not originally come from within, as Campbell wished, but art is always an internal process, despite its adherence to external form and frequent inspirations con- centrated from environmental provocations. M y first hypnotic encounter attempted to deal with several periods of amnesia. In particular, I had a psychic block surrounding my taking of a photograph of a beam of light projected down from the sky. I had a fleeting sense during the hypnotic experience of imagic deception superimposed upon my psychological defenses of resis- tance. I experienced intense resistance to certain images. Whether the \"deception\" came from within, i.e., was self- induced, or was externally imposed, I am not yet sure. I tried to deny images with which I did not want to relate. I feared that I had perhaps borrowed them from other sources be- cause I could not accept their credibility. I was afraid of their reality, also. I tried to think them away, i.e., deny them immediately upon their appearance during the nonverbal session. Although the psychiatrist encouraged me to speak fre- quently during the hypnotic regression, words could not come through my struggle. My entire participation in the psychiatrically induced hypnotic state, while nonverbal, was hardly silent or non-imagic. I felt panic. Although I tried to speak, my speech was stunted, partially because of intense gasping for breath and sobbing which alternated in waves. I am usually consciously very verbal; speaking is one active mode of my consciousness. My experience in hypnosis, however, was visceral, i.e., sensual-tactile-perceptive and emotional. But the images were in my consciousness, none- theless, despite my efforts to \"not tell\" of them, as I twice heard commanded \"way back in my head\" when we started. The body sensation and projected emotion of fear and tension also included groaning, covering my eyes, some Edward Carlos is an artist and teacher, and MUFON State Section Director for Franklin, Coffee and Grundy Counties, Tennessee.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 2% December 1992"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The face of the creature with large goggle eyes that curved around the side of its head was suddenly pulling on a \"skin \" mask of my father ... thrashing of the body, grabbing my arm several times and rubbing or scratching it, and attempting to lean upward from a reclining position in order to look around from side to side. I experienced a rush of images as I was counted out. I sought to verbally clarify the hypnotic induction in those initial moments after \"coming out,\" and while still in a dazed post-hypnotic state. During a period immediately after the hour in the doctor's office, I stated that I felt like transparent slides were slid right behind or within my eyes, or perhaps immediately in front of me between my face and the object of my perception to alter my own visual impressions. In retelling the story in a subsequent session, this superimpo- sition of an image over an image, as if \"through\" my own eyes, remained the most painful memory. Dual images seemed to almost overlay each other as if to induce false impressions or deceptions. These images appeared almost simultaneously, but one image could feel more \"intended\" than another, as if meant to dominate by \"hidden\" mental suggestion. One such image was of my father as a young man bending over and down on me as a child, looking at me face to face, smiling as if to reassure me, to calm me. But there was worry in his eyes. W hen I \"reverted\" to an adult body, a vague anal sensation occurred but denial was equally felt. There were no erotic sensations or sexual feelings experienced in this instance. I felt my adult legs being spread. I knew I was on a table at that moment. From the end of the \"table\" I saw a creature moving toward the foot of same where it stood. I tried vividly to deny this image. Staring at me from the end of the table, but yet close to my face, I saw a bald, large-eyed, insect/reptile-like face. This creature face seemed to be behind a return of my father's face, which was again brought close to me. It was as if I was receiving a suggestion of the possibility of molestation, which would be an easier, more socially acceptable matter of discourse (in our time) than to admit to the \"monster\" present there that I kept trying to deny. That realization offends me. The horror of the monster incipiated my denial, but the detection of the imposed image of my father's face seemed a definite deception and provo- cation to me. The experience included this perception: The face of the creature with large goggle eyes that curved around the side of its head was suddenly pulling on a \"skin\" mask of my father, whom I knew had been \"led\" off after the initial reassurance. The mask was offered for my perception. Yet it seemed like a photographic slide image superimposed between myself and the object of perception, or actually painfully slid through my eyes. My father had floated, drawn backwards, through an opening in the \"wall and disappeared prior to this. I saw myself as a child standing and holding onto something's hand. This perceived child (myself) asked, \"Where is my daddy going?\" This was one of the two images by which I externalized myself, i.e., in which I could see myself as an object figure. (The other was floating in an air or light stream behind one of my adult sons). Then the ugly image I kept trying to deny was in front of me again, bending toward me with this image of my father's head, as needed for reassurance to calm me down. My father's face, although young, was not unlike a drawing from age 16 that I had made of my father at the time of his premature death in his fifties. This image from my personal historical perception was part of my awareness of the superimposition in front of the creature. But the face was also superimposed with the face of a male poet from the 19th century, who in a somewhat recent dream masturbated me using a plastic cup-like \"machine\" which had an upper compartment to capture and retain the semen upon ejacula- tion. I realized while hypnotized that both images (male poet, father mask) were false. I also \"saw\" pincers as fingers, or finger-like tools, coming toward me from an arm or arm-like apparatus. Later in the week I wondered about non-conscious medical or surgical operations influencing images as body memories (I have had two deviated septum operations and a large tumor removed from behind my right eye, with \"cosmetic\" eye surgery following that, i.e., four operations on my head). M y body as emotional-consciousness had now, at this moment with this double or overlapping imagery, shifted to a later time, to an adult stage, and the estranging, fearsome feeling continued again. Fear was recurrent, al- tered only by pauses which represented regressions to child- hood during the psychiatrically suggested time when I pho- tographed the beam of light connected with my amnesia. Somehow there were image connections, perhaps symbolic, with memories which were childhood feelings occurring within the adult body \"reliving\" a possible childhood event. I thought initially that the monster or insect-being was considerably different from images of \"humanoids\" or \"aliens\" in various books, such as illustrations in Budd Hopkins' Intruders, or on the cover of Whitley Strieber's Communion. The image I drew the next morning was much more humanized than the insect-like being(s) in my \"en- counter\" during hypnosis. Under hypnosis I saw a brain- sack at the lower back of the head, i.e., lower than in drawings where the forehead is high, although from a frontal position that height remained and I drew it as such. The figure was greyish-white, spindly and skinny-elongated in body conformation, maybe a bit knobby and slightly wrinkled MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"and slightly textured. After resisting the presence of this image, I finally drew it the next morning from diverse angles, including a three-quarter view which indicated the \"brain-sack.\" I do not remember ever seeing anything but a frontal image in anyone else's sketches. However, the drawing proved to be decidedly similar to other individuals' sketches from a frontal view which surprised me. I sensed the hypnotic image-form, though, to be different than what my drawing verified, but an image once objectified, as art, takes on its own reality and its own substance and power, so I am not certain. My point in this article, and ultimately my plea, is that the investigations or research do not, in any of the literature that I have read, deal with images other than in the broadest, most generalized, narrative context. They certainly do not treat them with the same visual or psychological manner with which an artist might be drawn to deal with such occurrences. Many questions necessarily arise. How do images ap- pear in the creative process and what meanings are implied? What relationship exists among dream consciousness, anes- thetized unconsciousness, and hypnotic states? How does one's creativity affect images from traumatic experiences or from experiences involving non-consciousness, as in medi- cal operations where stress is consciously or medically repressed by chemistry? F or several years my own art work has been moving toward shamanic, ecological, healing imagery. I am more aware of the landscape as healing and nurturing, of other species as family, friends and spirit guides. Images of monsters or creatures may be shamanic and spiritual as well; vampires, angels and mermaids/mermen have appeared frequently in my work. These are understood as psychologi- cally relevant to the oceanic unconscious, to androgynous implications, inter-species relationships, and to atmospheric contexts. Environmental and spiritual awareness are now consciously integral to my artistic work and \"pictorial\" imagery is referential to multiplicitous consciousnesses. To me these drawings are both ecological, as an induced awareness of the need to respect and save the earth, air, and waters, and psychological, in the sense of dreams and other visionary experiences of imagic creativity. I would not use the word \"imagination\" here, or \"fantasy\"; these terms seem non-relevant to either my experience or my intent. When I first read Whitley Streiber's Communion, and later Trans- formation, I was struck with the imagic process in his creativity and with the similarity of several of his novelistic images to my own artistic efforts in art and theater. I tried to rationalize the connection of images of \"monsters\" or \"creatures\" in my own art works by considering that the creative process itself raises up in us, by our creative energy, a biological development of similar images according to age and maturity and that, that might account for the similarity. What relationship exists among dream con- sciousness,anesthetized unconsciousness and hypnotic states? How does one's creativity affect images from traumatic experiences or from experiences involving nonconsciousness, as in surgical operations where stress is medi- cally repressed by chemistry? Although there may be truth to such developmental stages in human growth, it may equally be true that it is a rationaliza- tion searching for comfortable intellectual answers to un- comfortable emotional experiences. Now, I am not so sure this is not just a form of resistance from, or of self-deception of, a horrification that as an artist I am always trying to assimilate and to transform. Even denied traumas remain in body memory once perceived. These experiences lodge in the soul of the body, but may not yet be open to conscious awareness. Body perceptions and mental symbols and concepts are involved in the memory process and consequently in creation of artistic images. Creative powers may enable assimilation and reconstruc- tion. But, in one sense the artistic imagery also might be a provocative substitute, as if to deny the source of the terroristic imagery in the consciousness that screens itself by way of the art. The screening may be a biological imperative of the human species having to do, in my case, with aware- ness of the multiplicity of consciousness and the transpar- ency of imagery while under hypnosis. The image may be the self-intentional means by which I must make art from my own necessity, but yet might not truly verify the source. There is something valid at stake here in the questioning, I think. The power of the image is communicative beyond a probable or capable intent of empowering. Society has his- torically shown frequent and nonrational fear of art and its power of transformation, or art's very irrationality. Is that a prudent response? I am writing this hoping that other artists, thespians, poets or other creative writers who find themselves involved with psychological or mythological creatures or monsters, even of the \"acceptable\" kinds (Michael Myers' \"Hallow- een\" and sequels, Freddy Kruger, Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the Flyfman] or a great white shark), and who suspect encounters have induced possible imagery in their art, or who have had \"encounters\" that have been verified in one manner or another, including psychiatric hypnosis, will contact me on the subject for discussion. I am feeling very alone here in this avenue and believe there are potential implications, if not answers, concerning this phenomenon which are buried in artistic imagery, and which need to be adequately researched and perhaps verified. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"News'n'Views Fund for UFO Research Quarterly Report: July-September, 1992 T he major activity during this quarter was the Fund's coordination of a publicity tour in Washington, D.C., on August 31 and September 1, which coincided with the publication of Crash at Corona by Stanton T. Friedman and Don Berliner. The book details the reported recovery of a UFO and alien bodies outside Corona, New Mexico, in July 1947, and the alleged recovery of another craft, along with four aliens, on the Plains of San Agustin in western New Mexico. The event was sponsored by the book's publisher, Paragon House. A participant in the Washington media event was Jesse Marcel, Jr. M.D., whose father was the Roswell base intel- ligence officer who recovered a sizeable amount of the debris from the crash site outside Corona. The highlight of the media tour was a news conference at the National Press Club, which resulted in articles in The Washington Times, The Chicago Sun-Times, The Houston Post, The Denver Post, and The Albuquerque Tribune. A local television station also covered the news conference for its evening news program and invited Friedman and Marcel to appear as guests on its morning news program the next day. In addi- tion, Berliner and Friedman have conducted interviews with more than 50 radio stations across the country. The event was successful in drawing a considerable amount of atten- tion to the Roswell crash case. According to a poll distributed by the Fund and the Center for UFO Studies from June through September, an overwhelming majority of those responding (85%) believe at least one UFO crashed in New Mexico in July 1947. A majority responding (65%) believe a crash occurred outside Corona and that alien bodies were recovered. Opinions about the reported UFO crash on the Plains are fairly evenly divided: 30% believe there was a crash; 25% believe there was no crash; and 30% aren't sure. However, the question about Gerald Anderson (who says he was present at the event), drew the fewest number of positive responses. Nine- teen percent of those surveyed believe him; 38% don't; and 40% are undecided. Because there are a number of potentially significant leads to pursue in the reported UFO crash on the Plains, the Fund's Board of Directors in September approved a request for up to $2,000 for an on-site investigation to be conducted by Berliner and Friedman later this year. Also during this period, the fund was pleased to assist the newly-established International UFO Museum and Research Center at Roswell, New Mexico, in its fundraising drive to acquire a photo display from the Center for UFO Studies. National Board Member Richard Haines, Ph.D., has announced that the name of the Joint American-Soviet Aerial Anomaly Federation has been changed to the Joint USA-CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) Aerial Anomaly Federation, to reflect the changes which have taken place in the former Soviet Union. During this period, the Executive Committee approved a request from Dr. Haines for $1,200 to purchase a fax machine for use in Moscow by the UFO Center and to pay for Russian-to- English translation of selected reports and articles that would be of value to English-speaking investigators. Readers of the Mufon UFO Journal are aware of the recent project, spearheaded by Michael Chorost, to acquire and analyze physical evidence associated with the current wave of crop circles in England. Chorost's project was supported in part by a $2,000 grant from the Fund. He has promised to write a preliminary report on his investigation for the Fund by the end of the year, and a final report will be available early next year. (MUFON contributed $2500 to Project Argus.) During this period, the Fund received a proposal from UFO investigator Dan Wright for financial support to estab- lish a database of UFO abduction reports. Wright has recruited about 20 people to transcribe audiotapes of inter- views and hypnosis sessions. The estimated costs would be up to $4,L35 for expendable materials during the first year of the project, and between $6,950 to $16,300 in non-ex- pendable materials (principally, the purchase of a computer and the necessary software). The Fund is seeking sponsor- ship for the project. Jerome Clark, editor of the International UFO Reporter and a member of the board of the Center for UFO Studies, was selected to receive the 1992 Isabel Davis Award. With the recognition comes a check in the amount of $ 1,000. The nominees were selected by the Fund's Board of Directors and voted upon by the Fund's donors, whose contributions supported the cash award. UFOs at the United Nations by John F. Schuessler L ate in 1978, prominent UFO researchers approached the United Nations with the suggestion to set up some type of international clearing house whereby investigators and researchers would be able to coordinate scientific re- search into unidentified flying objects on an international level, and to inform the Secretary-General of the observa- tions, research, and evaluation of such activities. The UN General Assembly responded favorably by adopting Deci- sion GA 33/426. Unfortunately, nothing was done to bring the decision to fruition and it lies dormant to this very day. Early in 1992 Mohammand Ahmad Ramadan, Presi- dent of the United Nations Parapsychology Society, sug- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"gested it was time to reacquaint the United Nations with Decision GA 33/426 with the intent of forming the agency called for in the Decision. In order to make this happen, he felt it necessary to have a series of presentations aimed at providing an update of the UFO situation. He then pro- ceeded, with the strong support of MUFON's Robert Bletchman, to organize the United Nations Symposium on Extraterrestrial Intelligence and Human Future which oc- curred on October 2, 1992, just ten days before NASA was to begin its SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program. The symposium was not aimed at traditional academia or the media. It was felt that traditional academia has proved to be insufficient in solving problems of this magnitude and needs help itself in having credibility for the future. As far as the media is concerned, it is saturated with UFO data and all of those concerned have already made up their minds — for or against. No UFO witness will make them change their minds, unless they see for themselves. The mission of the symposium, then, was not to change people but to network with those who already are willing to listen, especially among the United Nations non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International, Red Cross, Green- peace, B'nai Brith, etc. These organizations are the greatest catalyst of change in modern times. For instance, they fought very hard to force President Bush to attend the Earth Summit in Rio. It was noted that the \"old guards\" of politics and science would be apprehensive, fearful we were pulling the carpet from under their feet. Therefore, the tone of the symposium was to present the data and leave the audience to decide for themselves, the way I believe it should always be done. Hundreds of representatives of the United Nations NGOs meet weekly to investigate problems having a worldwide scope. Many of these representatives did attend the sympo- sium and responded favorably. The Dag Hammarskjold Auditorium was filled to capacity. We were fortunate in having Linda Howe available for a special noon program prior to the symposium, but held in the same auditorium. She provided a Crop Circle Mystery Update in a special one and one-half hour program. Symposium speakers were each given one hour to present their message. After a brief introduction by Mr. Ramadan, Stanton Friedman gave an energetic and enter- taining presentation titled \"The Cosmic Watergate.\" I fol- lowed with the \"Medical and Scientific Evidence.\" After a short break, the program resumed with a presentation on \"The Human Evidence,\" by Dr. Rauni Leena Kilde, M.D. of Norway. Dr. Kilde revealed her own personal abduction experience. The final presenter was Dr. Norma Milanovich, speaking on the \"Cosmic-Spiritual Evidence and Experi- ence,\" using material channelled through her computer. After a question and answer period by the panel of speakers, an open letter to the Secretary-General from the panel of speakers, was read aloud to the audience by Robert H. Bletchman. The letter was to be hand-delivered to the Secretary-General on the following Monday. (A copy was printed in the November Journal, page 12.) The UFO mystery is not limited to the United States, it is a worldwide problem. Therefore, it was appropriate to bring this strong message to the United Nations, with the expectation that the U.N. will proceed to form the UFO agency called for by Decision GA 33/426. There is hope that it will be done correctly this time.

There are those who believe Beckley's name shouldn't even be raised in polite society, while others may want to know about any new UFO book on the market, regardless of its intrinsic merit or value. It is in the interest of complete \"disclosure\" for our readers, then, that we mention these latest titles. The first, and only one to bear the name of a recogniz- able author other than Beckley, is The Other, by Brad Steiger (paper, 192 pp. illus., no price). In fact, you may already have this one in your collection, as it's basically a truncated reprint of the author' s Gods of Aquarius — UFOs and the Transformation of Man, first published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1976. It's a mixed bag, to say the least, with chapters on force fields and vibrations, the little folk, creatures, and just about everything else that could be thrown into the UFO stew, however tenuous or remote the connection. If you're into channeled messages from the so- called \"Space Brothers\" — even ones with names like Ox- Ho — then this is for you. In the same essential format (paper, 160 pp., illus., no price) is Timothy Green Beckley' s own Subterranean Worlds Inside Earth, based on speculation that some UFOs emanate from within the earth's surface, from caverns or carved-out underground bases, or from within a hollow planet. Mixed bag is the operative word here, too, with the topics ranging from supposed ancient teachings to the more recent writings of Ray Palmer, Richard Shaver and others. In a slightly larger (8.5x11 inch) paper format are Beckley's Strange Encounters, subtitled \"Bizarre & Eerie Contact With UFO Occupants\" (96 pp., illus., $10.95), UFOs Among the Stars (112 pp., illus., $12.95) and The American Indian UFO-Starseed Connection (112 pp., il- lus., $12.95). The middle title is a collection of UFO sight- ings and encounter stories by various celebrities, from the Moody Blues and John Lennon, to Jackie Gleason and William Shatner. It's hard to assess the written material in these works critically and objectively, because the first impulse is simply to write it all off as UFO and science- fiction pulp literature. Is it entertaining, then? Perhaps, depending, of course, on your idea of entertainment. But it's certainly not the sort of stuff you'd want to base a Ph.D. thesis on. On the other hand, there are a few interesting illustrations scattered throughout most of the volumes, and it's still a relatively free country.

Fortean Times (Bi-monthly, 70 pp., $4.95 U.S.) Edited by Bob Rickard and Paul Sieveking. S ince the last couple of issues of Fortean Times have turned up on my own local newsstand, here in the remote print outpost of San Antonio, I'm assuming FT is probably now getting more or less national distribution in this coun- try. For the uninformed, FT is the grandaddy of Fortean pub- lications, Fortean referring to Charles Fort (1874-1932), the author of four books on the weird and unusual. In working terms, fortean or \"forteana\" refers to anything strange or seemingly paranormal under the sun, from unusual weather and social phenomena, to reports of lights in the skies and elves on the ground, you name it. In fact, FT is a mixed bag on purpose, presented with a literary grace (and mordant sense of humor) not normally found in the field. Since its inception several years ago, FT*has undergone several formal changes and at least one false start at being a commercial newsstand magazine. The newest incarnation, published by John Brown Publishing Ltd., of London, has offended some of the old-guard purists with its slick, glossy covers and patently commercial approach, including full- page advertising. I'm of two minds about some of the more radical changes myself, but all things change over time, including FT, and there's no doubt that the new format will reach many more readers with the Fortean message than ever before. The latest issue (No. 65) carries a few of the regular columns and extensive book review section for which FT is most well known, along with an interview of John Keel, feature articles on \"Blood Miracles\" and the \"Hueytown Hum,\" among others, and a color center section pull-out (on the Martian \"Sphinx\"), all well written and copiously illus- trated as usual. UFOs and related matters are frequently covered. In fact, this time around there's an article by Jenny Randies on how to photograph a UFO (and what to do after you've done it).

Unless noted, no sound, odor or vibra- tion was detected. All times are local. • Log #921908W: About 1:00 a.m. on August 19, 1992, a 31-year-old male was driving near Tucson, AZ when he noticed a strange light off in the distance; Investigator Kathy Woodward. As the light form approached from the northeast it made swooping movements similar to that of a falling leaf. It descended rapidly, came across a field and began to hover. A cone of light came out of the bottom which completely bathed the area, illuminating the ground and surrounding vegetation. At this point the witness was approximately 200 to 300 yards from it and was able to discern that it was a solid object, an actual craft. It looked like a manta ray with a dull black matte finish. There was a heavy raised ridge that ran down the center of the craft and a wide continuous bar of lights that wrapped around the front. It was approximately 30 feet in diameter. The young man pulled his car over to the side of the road and stopped When he got out of his car the craft approached to within 300 feet of him. He heard no sound. Then the craft began to ascend and the man could see the moonlight reflecting off of it. As the craft moved directly overhead, the witness got back into his car and sped away. After getting back on the freeway he spotted the craft again as it stopped over a nearby farm house. Again, a bright light came from the underside of the craft, engulfing the entire house and the area around it for almost 20 seconds. It was about 15 feet above the house. The craft then moved away from the house, illuminating a large area of trees behind the house. The craft then ap- proached the witness again, coming to within 50 to 75 yards of his car. It then moved away in a southwesterly direction. The craft was in sight for about 15 minutes. • Log #890012W: Something very strange is occurring in the area of the middle Branch of the Cosumnes River in El Dorado County, California; investigator Virgil C. Staff. A continuous series of events has been going on since 1989, mostly during a period from December through March or April, usually after sunset. Incidents have increased in 1992, with many events now occurring during daylight hours. One witness, who will be referred to as BG, reported sighting a large disc-shaped craft departing from a cloud-like form in an otherwise cloudless sky. On occasion, strange beings have been seen moving across the landscape. They left no tracks. According to BG, \"I got close to three of them one night and it's like they had little glowing things on their legs. They told the witness they were leaving after a big disc-shaped craft descended near their campsite during the night and lowered a hose into the river. I could see their legs, but I couldn't see them moving.\" One night BG saw two transparent bubble-like objects. One bubble had one occupant, the other had two occupants. The objects were smaller than a Volkswagen car and were completely illuminated. Inside one, two beings sat side-by- side. One had his hands hanging down and the other had his hands on his legs. In the second bubble, the being sat straight with his hands on his legs. \"I could see their fingers,\" BG said. \"They had three or four fingers.\" BG has also seen large and small boomerang-shaped white lines, like an outline, going up through the canyon. He said that what he sees is like electricity running along the white outline. One family set up camp in the canyon and departed the next morning. They told BG that they were leaving after a big disc-shaped craft descended near their campsite during the night and lowered a hose into the river. • Log #921101E: On 14 August 1992 at 9:45 p.m., a mother and her 18-year-old daughter drove under a strange object as it crossed Route 22 at tree-top level near Homer City, PA; investigator, Keith Bastianini. The object had pale blue light coming from inside a silvery, beamed structure that was about 60 feet across. The ill-defined shape appeared some- what triangular, and blue lights flashed from two of the structural beams. The ladies drove to the Blairsville shop- ping center parking lot and still very excited, watched it change direction sharply and move out of sight behind the trees. Total time of sighting was lOto 15 minutes. The next day the fuses for the programmable clock and radio were found to be blown, and the UFO was the suspected cause. • Log #920801 E: On March 14, 1992 between 8:23 and 8:32 p.m., 52 witnesses observed seven UFOs, four at one time by some witnesses, over Gulf Breeze, FL from seven locations; investigators were Art Hufford, Gary Watson, Bland Pugh, Joe Barron, Boots Eckert and Clompton Jones. This was a greatly significant event since 39 of the wit- nesses, in a parking lot east of Pensacola Beach, at 8:00 p.m. started a process of projecting thought sequences, led by Dr. Steven Greer, in a friendly invitation to the UFO folk. Recorded sounds were played, and powerful light-beam patterns were made in the sky just before four of the bright cherry-red UFOs appeared. Some produced white light as they first appeared and turned brilliant white before disap- pearing. Bruce Morrison and Brien Boldman got video from the beach location. Wayne Peterson's video from Shoreline MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Park South was extremely valuable for triangulation data. Several people got still photos from three locations. A most significant event occurred when a 500,000 candle power light was flashed at the UFOs, and at least one of them blinked back in similar sequences. After many wished the UFOs to come closer, two of them moved about 0.8 miles closer before they dimmed out as they each climbed 400 or 500 feet from their original altitudes of 2200 and 3000 feet. One photo by Art Hufford shows the red light of one of the first UFOs pulsing 5.5 times in 1/8 of a second. The closest UFO recorded on video was 2.1 miles; however, Joe Barren saw two from his home at a distance of less than a mile. He and his wife, Doreen, also saw a seventh UFO descend rapidly from the west and pass directly overhead. The formal report was 10 pages with 82 pages of supporting documentation. • Log #921508W: While driving in the city of Salem, Ore- gon at 12:07 a.m. on August 15,1992, an adult male sighted a triangular-shaped craft with red and white lights: Investi- gators Skip and Polly Schultz. It was a large craft, probably 1 1/2 times the size of a large house. It was black in color and appeared to be turning very slowly on its axis directly above trees about 75 feet from the witness. The tops of the trees moved as the craft moved over them. The man heard no sound coming from the craft. As the craft moved away to the east, the witness drove to his home which sets high on a hill with a good view of the Cascade Mountain Range east of Salem. When he arrived home he could still see the craft as a light from over the mountains. The witness and his mother watched the light move about over the mountains until 2:45 a.m. READERS' CLASSIFIEDS LET'S GET IN TOUCH...I am an abductee wanting very much to correspond with others who are also trying to cope with this experi- ence.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 296 December 1992"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"LETTERS CE-4 Research In April 1992, a project was born, one of the most ambitious and far-reaching ever attempted in the annals of UFO research. At this juncture, it involves seven prominent persons engaged in CE-4 investigations (via both hypnosis and consciously recalled accounts) as well as volunteer transcribers of the resulting audiocassettes. As of mid-November, over 100 tapes had been tran- scribed and returned or were in process. The writer coordinates this project under the guidance of John Carpenter, MUFON's Director of Abduction Research. A primary element of the effort is the creation of a cross referenced index of key words and phrases from the verbatim transcripts in order to promote future comparative analysis. It is time to expand the project in terms of both CE-4 researchers and transcribers. Persons who are qualified and experienced in the use of hypnosis may write to Walt Andrus. Selection is subject to the approval of Messrs, Andrus, Carpenter and others. The obvious payoff for those chosen to participate is the transcription of CE-4 related sessions without charge. Later utilization of an ever expanding index to conduct research across a broad base of cases is intended. We are likewise in need of additional audiotape transcribers. Such individuals, first and foremost, must be willing to repeatedly devote 20 or more hours within a three-week period and to do so under strictures of confi- dentiality. A tape recorder and earphones are necessities. Those who employ an IBM-compatible PC, with Word- Perfect or similar DOS-run word processing, are espe- cially encouraged to apply. Transcriptions are not an easy task, and so we are looking for experienced individuals such as career secretaries who might view this as their primary means of contributing to the field. Interested parties should write to the address below. Mailing and attendant costs are reimbursed by MUFON for both the researchers and transcribers. This exhilarating and crucial area of UFO research demands that we do all we can while there is still time. —Dan Wright 117 S. South St. Morrice, MI 48857 No Discrimination? Gee, Dennis, no discrimination against women in ufology? None at all? I see where in the Editor's Column in the October issue you \"categorically reject any notion or implication that ufology is a bastion of male Anglo- Saxon chauvinism.\" Is ufology unique? If ufology isn't a white male bastion, then it's one of the few organized groups in the USA that isn't. So let's get down to earth, shall we? The real ques- tion is: Is there more discrimination against women in ufology than in the rest of American society? My own feeling is no, there isn't, but since discrimination against women is rampant in the rest of American society, then that isn't saying much, is it? Nor does it help to say, as you do in your column, that ufology has less discrimination than CSICOP! That's like saying we have less insanity than they do on the psychiatric ward and fewer criminals than in the state penitentiary. Actually, I'm glad you wrote that column, Dennis. It's the first mention of discrimination in ufology I've read. So many times I've run my eyes over the officer lists, and lists of the Boards of Directors of UFO organi- zations, and the speaker lists at UFO conferences, search- ing in vain for the women. Seldom have I mentioned this to anyone. Since you counted up who's represented in the MUFON Journal for the past 2 years, I thought I would too. Leaving out Gribble, Parish, Andrus, Night Sky, Letters and Case Log, and counting in UFO Press, I come up with 96 male authors represented and 17 female since January 1991. You mention Linda Howe. We all admire Linda. In the absence of statutory restrictions, it is never possible to keep a brilliant and energetic woman, or minority, down. Where discrimination really operates and takes its toll is at the mid-ranks of any organization. Discrimination is usually not expressed in major and obvious acts. It is located in the innumerable small, barely noticeable, always ambiguous acts - the encouragements not given (at the mid-ranks), the mentoring not done, the risks with a less experienced person not taken, the idiosyncrasies not tolerated. Innumerable small acts. Someone white and male weighs the balance and decides \"no.\" And not even a conscious process. It is found in the ideas not thought of, ideas like \"How about you (female, minority) writing an article for the MUFON JournalT That's a hint, Dennis. And of course, discrimination operates powerfully in the minds of the oppressed who, by adulthood, usually deter themselves as much as they are deterred by those around them. That's a hint to all the women in MUFON! - who are legion in the mid and lower ranks. Let's get Address letters to Dennis Stacy, Box 12434, San Antonio, TX78212.

We know as much about those funny things flying around in the skies as the men do. —Elaine Douglass State Director Washington, D.C. Dancing Angels I was surprised and pleased to receive such a long, thoughtful response to my letter complaining about the tone of some of the articles published in the MUFON UFO Journal. I needed to be reminded how touchy it must be to edit such a magazine. The contributors all have their pet theories, don't they? And each one defends that theory with more emotion than fact, at this stage of relatively little hard information about the subjects. It reminds me of the stories we hear of the fervor and seriousness with which medieval theologians debated how many angels could dance on the head of a pin. It's interesting that religion and science, which are often at odds these days, sometimes generate identically inflexible attitudes in their adherents. Science, as a belief system, can be as emotionally involving to the true believer as any religion. UFO/crop circle researchers — paranormal research- ers of all kinds — seem to hover in a netherworld be- tween conventional science and mainstream religion, scorned by purists on both sides. Is this research a new science, a new religion, or merely a dead-end historical oddity like dancing angels? Oh, but it's fascinating, whatever it is and, if it is \"real\" in any sense, so impor- tant. Your article, \"The Circles of Summer,\" was both balanced and informative ... a model of reason from which others could leam much, if they would. Thank you for your invitation to contribute to the Journal. I'll think about it and see if anything comes that might be appropriate. —Jean Thompson Lakewood, CO Hollywood Drama A few of those of us who prize MUFON as a respect- able confraternity of persons striving for a better under- standing of the UFO phenomenon have begun to have a few concerns that have failed to find adequate press. We have some very bright \"leading lights\" in our midst whose communication skills have a high degree of flavor of Madison Avenue, or maybe even more accu- rately, Hollywood script writers; artists with a keenly developed flair for the dramatic. High drama is an effective sales technique; the concern of some of us is that we are possibly being sold some high Hollywood style drama whose producer, or producers, are in it principally for the financial rewards. The dramatic productions of these authors, more art than evidence, have been effective enough, because their dramatic polish has been persuasive enough, to garner a cultish following of large proportions; a cult that has accepted an entire formalized mythos about the nature and purpose of the little grey people from the stars among us. The mythology that these artists (they are not scien- tists) have so effectively inculcated into the popular consciousness is now virtually \"set in concrete\" just because publishers have preferred to favor publishing a stream of books characterized by high drama over the less titillating, staid chronicles of the more conservative and cautious scientists and investigators. We now have a popular orthodoxy in place that I (and other members of MUFON) fear will increasingly stifle research and speculation outside its rigidly defined archetypes and motifs. It think it is time for a vigorous and unflinching re-evaluation of its basic tenets. If the authors contributing to our Journal have not found a first or second career producing UFO literature and films principally for financial gain, but rather are primarily concerned with contributing to our collective corpus of knowledge about the phenomenon, then let them not naively offer the rest of us the affront of a registered copyright notice under their bylines; as a published author myself (astronomy), I am aware that registration of copyright and notice of same are not required to establish copyright. The use of the copyright registration logo smacks of commercialism. Scientific investigation has traditionally been a not-for-profit activity, for obvious reasons. And let none of us who are true to the principle of open inquiry for the truth be afraid to read CSICOP's journal, The Skeptical Inquirer. In the light of recent developments, perhaps we may justifiably think of CSICOP as cast in the role of watchdog in helping readers winnow the chaff from the grain when it comes to understanding the contributions of the various writers and researchers in our field. —David A.

Webb January 1993 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.4) is well up in the SW at dusk, reaching a point farthest east of the Sun on the 19th. At that time the increasingly brilliant planet doesn't set until about 4 hours after the Sun. Watch the waxing lunar crescent move past Venus from far below the planet on the 23rd to above it on the 27th. Moving westward in Gemini near Pollux and Castor, Mars gleams at a magnitude -1.5 during the first week of January — as bright as the brightest star Sirius. Our red neighbor is nearest Earth on the 3rd, at a distance of 58 million miles, and opposite the Sun on the 7th. At that time Mars rises at sunset in the NE and remains visible all night. Nearly overhead around midnight, the planet is very fa- vorably placed for northern observers, although not as near as it was during the last opposition. For telescopic information, see the December \"Night Sky.\" Jupiter (-2.1), not far from Spica in Virgo, rises in the E at midnight on January 1, at 11 PM in midmonth, and 10 PM on the 31 st. The giant world begins retrograde (westward) motion on the 28th. Saturn (0.7), in Capricomus, continues to separate from Venus after last month's close pairing. Best viewed early in January, the ringed planet descends into the solar glare by month's end. It sets in the WSW shortly after 7 PM on the 1 st, 6:30 in mid-January, and only half an hour after the Sun on the 31st. Use binoculars to find the thin crescent Moon 6° to the right of Saturn on the 23rd, very low in the WSW. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars moves across the southern sky, setting in the NW about sunrise early in January and before dawn late in the month. Jupiter advances across the sky, standing halfway up in the S at dawn on the 1 st and in the SW at dawn on the 31 st. It lies above the quarter Moon on January 14. Moon Phases: Full moon — January 8 Last quarter — January 14 New moon — January 22 First quarter — January 30 The Stars: The midevening sky of January features an array of some of the brightest stars seen from temperate latitudes. Orion, the hour-glass-shaped hunter, is the main attraction in the southern sky. Betelgeuse marks Orion's right shoulder; bluish-white Rigel, his left knee. Surrounding the, hunter is a large halo of Ist-magnitude stars, the so-called Winter Circle. Moving around clock- wise from the lower left, the stars are brilliant Sirius, Procyon, Pollux and Castor the Twins (Mars nearby), Capella, Aldebaran, and Rigel. A hazy spot can be glimpsed NW of Aldebaran — the famous Pleiades star cluster. Whether observed with the naked eye, binoculars, or telescope, it is one of the out- standing sights in the winter sky and remains a lifetime favorite of all skygazers. The Big Dipper comes into better view in the NE, now balanced on the end of its handle. Calendar of UFO Conferences for 1993 February 6 — Metro D.C.

Accolades to the State Organizations As we have emphasized so often, the strength of MUFON is in its \"grass roots\" structure at the state and state section levels. Wherever strong leadership existed, it was reflected in more UFO sighting investigation reports, meetings, newsletters and increased membership. Some of the finest people in the world represent MUFON in the individual states, provinces and countries. As 1992 draws to a close and we anticipate the new year, the MUFON Board of Directors and the MUFON UFO Journal staff want to express our thanks to each and every member for their unselfish support and outstanding work. Over 4,200 copies of the December Journal were mailed to our subscribers/members, confirming MUFON's continued growth. We wish all of you a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. The cover of this/OH/vza/represents a personal Season's Greetings memento to all of our friends throughout the world. ROBERT M. WOOD, Ph.D. Director for Research Robert M. Wood, Ph.D., has accepted the position of Direc- tor for Research of MUFON. Dr. Bob graduated with a BS in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Colo- rado and was awarded his doctorate in Physics from Cornell. He is now in a senior management position at a large aerospace firm, and has had an active interest in UFOs since the early 60s. concentrating in the direction of \"How do they work?\" He has been instrumental in the successful develop- ment and application of advanced technology for several missile and space systems during his career. The Director for Research is expected to provide a focus for the coordination of the activities of our dozens of consultants in the physical sciences and engineering. He replaces Jim McCampbell, who has served in this role since 1974. The coordination of medical sciences, legal sciences, and abduction sciences fall under John Scheussler, Kenneth Wong, or John Carpenter, respectively. Bob Wood has been a Consultant to MUFON in physics since 1974. He and his wife reside in Newport Beach, CA. Dr. Bob's professional abilities will be an asset to MUFON. His son, Ryan S. Wood, is also involved in UFO research. UFOs, MJ-12 AND THE GOVERNMENT: A Report on Government Involvement in the UFO Crash Retrievals (113 pages) by Grant Cameron and T.

Also for advance planning by strong state or local MUFON organizations, these future locations are now available for written bids: 1996 - Eastern Region, 1997 - Central Region and 1998 - Western Region. Canada and Mexico are invited to bid whenever they feel comfortable in hosting a MUFON symposium. In 1982, the MUFON symposium was held in Toronto, Canada. Written bids should be submitted to Walt Andrus. 1993 National UFO Information Week Virginia M. Tilly, Director of Public Education, has announced that the 1993 National UFO Information Week has been scheduled for August 14 through 22,1993. Recog- nizing that considerable work is required to build photo exhibits for display purposes, now is the time to start plan- ning local activities for shopping malls, public libraries, etc., for next year. New Field Investigators During November a total of 26 Field Investigator exams were processed and the successful candidates promoted to Field Investigator status. Passing the exam is not tantamount to automatically being elevated, since the State Directors have the authority to veto individuals who are not ade- quately prepared or qualified to represent MUFON in this capacity. We must apologize to this group of new investiga- tors who probably became impatient while waiting for their grade results. Shirley A. Coyne, Director of Field Investi- gator Training, had a more pressing problem this summer while nursing her husband, George R. Coyne, Central Regional Director, back to health after a heart attack and triple bypass surgery. Both are now performing their indi- vidual functions in MUFON, since George is slowly regain- ing his strength after a very critical period. For those of you who signed the \"get well\" card for George that I passed around at the UFO Conference in Springfield, Missouri in October, he was elated beyond words when it was received. It is rumored that a few tears were shed when he reflected upon the thoughtfulness of his wonderful friends. Central Regional Director Election Due to personal health reasons, George R. Coyne will not seek a second four-year term as the Central Regional Director for 1993. The central region is composed of the following states: MI, OH, KY, TN, AL, MS, IN, IL, WI, MN, IA, MO, AR, LA, TX, OK, KS, NE, SD and ND. This is an elected office to the MUFON Board of Directors by all of the members living in the designated states through a ballot enclosed with the MUFON UFO Journal prior to the election. Anyone is eligible to be a candidate for this prestigious position, however, only State or Assistant State Directors may officially nominate candidates. If you are interested in being a candidate, please write to your State Director, expressing your desire and include a resume of your qualifications by January 30,1993. The election will be held in early 1993. This is an opportunity for present state leaders to fulfill greater responsibilities within MUFON. New Officers Reorganization of MUFON representatives in the Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.), formerly the U.S.S.R., continues with the following appointments: Vla- dimir G. Ajaja, Ph.D. (Moscow) will be the Representative for Western Russia (West of the Ural Mountains). He is one of the Co-Directors of the Joint USA-CIS Aerial Anomaly Federation and a Director of the Ufological Association of Russia. Yuri Stroganov (Yeisk) represents MUFON in the Krasnodar Region of southern Russia. New State Directors selected this month are George A. Filer, III, M.B.A. (Medford) for New Jersey, replacing Joseph J. Stefula who resigned. Mr. Filer is a retired major from the U.S.A.F. and former Assistant State Director for southern New Jersey. Juan Eduardo Failla, National Di- rector for Argentina, appointed Ricardo Cesar Calderon Bernal (Mendoza) to become the State Director for the states of Mendoza, San Luis and Cordoba. Norman L. Mark (Anchorage) accepted our invitation to become State Director for Alaska, assisted by Birch Pavelsky (Fair- banks). State Section Directors recently appointed are Sally J.
