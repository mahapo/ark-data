Smith, age 14, standing in the back yard of his Tulsa, Oklahoma home, pointed his small camera toward the darkened sky and clicked the shutter. The image he. recorded on the color negative has become noteworthy in Ufology. Alan was sighting his camera at an unidentified flying object in the sky. He and his father had observed a possible UFO on the previous night, August 1, however on this night they were prepared. NEGATIVE The negative shows an orange, blue, and whitish egg-shaped object, clearly defined in the sky. Protruding from the object are three tiny fingers. Dark bands bisect the colored segments. The picture was taken during the August 1-5, 1965 UFO flap that extended from Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas to California. For the first three days of this flap, Tinker AFB in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Carswell AFB in Ft. Worth, Texas confirmed sightings on their radars as fast as State Troopers in both states reported visual sightings. The Pentagon issued orders on August 4th to both USAF installations to refrain from cooperating with the State Police Agencies and provided their own casual and unlikely explanation for the hundreds of sightings. The night time sightings were attributed to the constellation Orion. THE OBJECT Alan said the second night he and his family were ready in case the object returned. He had loaded his official Boy Scout Camera (620) with Kodacolor X high speed film. When Alan was interviewed by the author in Tulsa nearly a year later, he said it (the object) moved from west to east and estimated L UFO PHOT< fiMi (C.E; „ _ -y AUTHOR AT ST. LOUIS SYMPOSIUM Dennis Stacy that it looked to be the size of a basketball or soccer ball. ''It again appeared as a ball of light, but moved slower than the first night. It was changing color from white, to red to blue-green. Its light pulsated and a high whining sound was being emitted. As the sound grew louder, the light became brighter.\" When I questioned him about the sound, he said \"it sounded like his mother's vacuum sweeper.\" His father confirmed this explanation, since I interviewed both witnesses in sequence. WITNESSES This case has all the attributes of an authentic UFO photograph. There were five witnesses to the object and four of them observed Alan taking the photograph. They included Alan; his father, A.L. Smith, 43, a turbine engine inspector for American Airlines in Tulsa; his sister Sheryle Holt, 18; Sheryle's husband, Ron Holt, 18, and a neighbor boy, Daryl Swimmer, 15. At that time, Alan' family lived at 4719 S. 29 West, Tulsa, Okla. and the Swimmer family at 4721 S. 29W. All gave the same basic description of the light in the sky but pointed out that it did not appear the same as it does in Alan's color picture. \"It was just a blob of light\" his sister said to a reporter from The Oklahoma Journal newspaper which obtained copyrights on the photograph. When it (the UFO) was almost directly overhead — about 11 o'clock high — Alan relates, he raised his camera and shot the picture. He exposed only one negative, because in the dark he could not see the next number in the window area to wind the film forward. (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"UFO AT MIGHT PHOTO, Continued ALMOST LOST The family waited 7 to 10 days before sending the film out for normal commercial processing, since they wanted to use the entire roll. The film was sent to Exel Camera Store in downtown Tulsa for processing. \"When we got the film back,\" Mrs. Smith explained, \"we were all disappointed. There was nothing in Alan's prints of the flying object. \"Then we started looking at the negatives and saw that the film company had not printed two of the negatives. One had a streak of light and the other had an object in one corner that appeared to be three or four colors,\" she said. \"We took it back to the film company and had them make an enlargement of that negative. The result was the UFO that had appeared over our backyard. The camera had gotten distinct lines of an object — while our eyes saw only a large round circle of light,\" she said. Mr. Smith said the object appeared to be about 36 to 40 feet in diameter and about 5,000 to 8,000 feet high. He based this upon his experience of visual sightings of aircraft in his work, etc. On the second night, August 2, A Ian R Smith when the picture was made, the object was in view for five minutes moving southwest to east. Alan said he saw the object, walked 25 feet to this house, picked up the camera, returned outside and waited until it was almost overhead before exposing the one negative. SOUNDS & COLORS Members of the family said they heard a whine increase as the object speeded up. There was also an increase in the intensity of the light. It first appeared white as a star, turning red as it came closer, gyrating, turning blue, then green then white, Mr. Smith said. The object appeared as if it were illuminated by searchlights. Members of the family said they could not see the definition of lights as it appears on the color negative. Professional photographers conjectured the camera was able to pick up details the human eye was unable to see. Atmospheric conditions that night included a dull moon, with a clear sky and stars. In order to perform photo analysis and to determine the credibility of the photograph, Cliff King, photographer and John Gumm, chief photographer for The Oklahoma Journal, shot color pictures of airplanes, stars, etc. in an effort to duplicate the image in some way. Both men are experienced, highly- skilled professional photographers. Gumm has served around the world and is known as an expert in his field. He reported that the Boy Scout camera used to shoot the picture has a fixed focus lens with a shutter speed of l-50th of a second and a relative aperture of F:ll. The film was Kodacolor X having a relative speed of ASA 64. The approximate focal length of the camera lens is 2y 2 inches or more technically, 60mm. ANALYSIS Gumm said after examination, \"this gives the object an arbitrary size of 50 feet diameter. Measuring the image size on the film (4.5mm) the object would have to have been less than a mile distance from the camera. Measuring the density of the film, the brightness of the object would be relatively twice that of the full moon.\" Mr. King shot another roll of the same type color film, in the same camera, standing in Alan Smith's backyard, at approximately the same time of night. This was done to eliminate the possibility that Alan's camera had a flaw in it or a light reflection was being bounced off of some earthly object. All tests proved fruitless. The airplane .picture looks like airplane lights. The color negatives shot by Cliff King turned up with no image or reflection. There was no flaw in the camera that could be detected by the Oklahoma Journal photographers. The image on the negative is real, they concluded. In addition to their own photo analysis, The Oklahoma Journal submitted one Kodacolor negative, an 8\" x 10\" color print and the news article from The Oklahoma Journal dated October 5, 1965 to Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr. TDEN/UFO. As head of Project Blue Book, Major Quintanilla assigned the project to the U.S.A.F. Photo Processing (DPP) and Photo Analysis (DPA) Divisions.

News article \"The Oklahoma Journal\" 5 October 1965 1. PURPOSE: This report answers Work Order Number 66-U submitted by Major H. Quintanilla, Jr., TD£;J/U?0, requesting a photo analysis of an alleged unidentified flying object photographed at Tulsa, Oklahoma on 2 August 1965. 2. ANALYSIS: The following analysis represents a joint effort of the Photo Processing (DPP) and Photo Analysis (DPA) Divisions. Based upon the information furnished, we can neither confirm or deny the identification of an unidentified flying object. The somewhat oval-shaped, tritcolored object shown in the photograph is believed to be an object; however, the following comments are furnished as discussion. The object is quite clear with rather well-defined edges and clarity of detail. Measurement of image size on the negative resulted in a 2.5 mm size rather than the U.5 mm stated in the news article. Using the 2.5 image size and the . camera/raige data'quoted in the article, the object becomes approximately 30 feet in diameter - or som'a liOJS smaller than quoted in the article - at a range of.less than one mile. Some question arises however as to the accuracy of the range determination (camera to subject) at the tine of day (01U5) and under the conditions stated in the news article. Range is very difficult to determine at night and cannot usually.be determined accurately even by experienced pilots. A further question is posed .as to why some tonal difference in the sky was not, recorded on the film in that atsmospheric conditions on the night of 2 August 1965 wei-e describ- ' ed as a,dull moon with a clear sky and stars. Some tonal variations in a sky background ara usually observed even on night photography. .The only variation observed in this case was a line caused by a scratch on the film. Photo processing personnel noted that the image be&ra a resemblance, although doesn't appear identical, to the effect they have observed obtained by photographing a nulti-colored revolving filter flood light of the type used to illuminate and color aluminum trees during the Christmas season.

Computerized photo enhancement was later developed by scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratories in Pasadena, California as a more refined tool for our space program. This process has been used successfully in the analysis of UFO photographs. Alan, a newspaper carrier boy for the Tulsa Tribune, said he had paid little attention to flying saucer reports in the past and had given only cursory attention to newspaper stories about them. The family is a typical middle- class group. They live in a modest home in the southwest part of Tulsa and were contacted by the Oklahoma Journal first. INTERVIEW The author of this article was visiting in Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Okla. and Pampa, Texas during the August 1965 UFO \"flap,\" however 1 was not fortunate enough to have had a personal sighting. 1 took advantage of the daily newspaper published reports in each of these cities to amass a file of sightings. At the same time the coverage on radio was quite extensive. I was not aware that Alan Smith had been able to photograph a UFO early in the morning of August 2, nor was he until several weeks later when enlargements were made of the color negative. I personally conducted a taped interview with both Alan Smith and his father A.L. Smith in July 1966, when my family was again vacationing in Tulsa. A photograph is included in this article showing Alan, holding a copy of The Oklahoma Journal that featured his photograph and sighting report. This copy of the newspaper is part of the MUFON file on this unique case. It may be noted that the color UFO photograph, Alan's article and photograph shared space on the front page with the visit of Pope Paul VI to New York City. W.P. \"Bill\" Atkinson, the publisher of The Oklahoma Journal in Oklahoma City is responsible for recognizing this newsworthy subject, for conducting the investigation and the series of UFO sighting report articles, throughout Oklahoma, that followed in his newspaper. ANNIVERSARY The twentieth anniversary of Alan's historic color UFO photo was . observed by the Tulsa World on Sunday, August 4,1985. The front page feature depicted a current photo of Alan holding the original copy of The Oklahoma Journal (now out of business) and his enlarged UFO photograph. Ralph W. Marler, staff writer and Jim Wolfe, photographer for the Tulsa World collaborated to produce an outstanding article commemorating this now famous event in UFO literature. Mr. Marler published a follow-up article the next day covering an interview with MUFON's International Director and the investigative activities of the Mutual UFO Network in Oklahoma, featuring Mrs. Jean Waller, State Director for Oklahoma and Dwight Dauben, Consultant. The MUFON UFO Journal purchased .the photograph from Jim Wolfe which adorns this month's front cover. (Since the Journal does not publish in color, the photo reproduction loses some of its significance.) Since the credibility of the photographer of a UFO is more important than the photo itself when performing a preliminary investigation, these factors have been stressed in this article. Professionals will conduct the photo analysis for MUFON, however the individual Field Investigator must obtain the vital film and camera data, where the photo was made, the weather conditions, and foremost, a character check of the photographer (continued on page 18) ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"SECURITY POLICY By Donald M. Ware Editor's Note: The author is a Lt. Colonel (Retired) U.S.A.F. He received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a M.S. in Nuclear Engineering. Mr. Ware was a U.S.A.F. fighter pilot and a graduate of the Air War College. He became a MUFON State Section Director in 1982 and the State Director for Florida in 1984. This article is Mr. Ware's personal viewpoint on UFO secrecy. How many MUFON investigators have considered the government policy of secrecy on UFOs from the point of view of a high official responsible for the security and welfare of the nation? I think if we all did this we could learn to accept the policy as necessary, and we may even earn some cooperation with government agents in our common quest for knowledge. INTRODUCTION Military pilots are debriefed by their intelligence officer after returning from each combat mission. By 1945 some agent in Washington had accumulated a number of detailed reports of Foo Fighters, from both combat theaters. In 1946 his office must have received reports from Sweden of objects with strange design and performance. This agency was concerned about Soviet expansionism and was very aware of the military impact of a technology breakthrough; i.e. radar, jet engines, and nuclear energy. In July 1947, the Roswell incident occurred. People like Hoyt S. Vandenberg must have concluded then that some UFOs were spacecraft controlled by an advanced intelligence, if they had not already reached that conclusion. They would realize that if our adversaries acquired the technology represented by these vehicles before we did, our security would be severely threatened. Information on such technology must receive the most extreme protection. AIR FORCE Visits from aliens demonstrating advanced technology are a national and international problem rather than a military problem. A research program based on highly-classified hard evidence of advanced technology must be conducted by a small group of highly paid individuals willing to work in remote places and spend the rest of their career in that endeavor. But military people must change jobs frequently to get promoted, and are not suitable for that kind of program. The researchers would want to gather additional information and material as it became available, but they were not listed-in the phone book. Therefore, the U.S. Air Force was chosen as the organization to accept UFO reports. This led to projects Sign, Grudge and Bluebook. The Air Force role . as the government's public relations agent was difficult, especially since they weren't the primary investigators of those cases that involved hard evidence or significant technical information. And most of them probably didn't, even know it. Before long they were just carrying out the policy codified by the Robertson Panel in 1953, to keep the public from getting excited about UFOs. Air Force efforts were criticized as grossly inadequate by many, but they were still serving a useful purpose. It wasn't until the mid-sixties that Air Force involvement became more of an embarrassment than a benefit, and the Condon report was used to get the military out of the public relations role. SECURITY POLICY Concerning classified information, most of us are familiar with the \"need- to-know\" policy. Fewer understand the different levels of compartment- alization this policy engendered. Even the President is not given information on some programs unless he is responsible for making decisions on that program. Presidents spend so much time talking to the press there is always the danger that classified words like \"stealth\" will be used. However, the security system can work well. For example, the YF-12 was flight tested before it was publicly acknowledged. The reason it works is because, if you have a secret you really must keep, you don't admit you have a secret. That way the KGB doesn't know who to bribe. REACTION So when the Air Force publicly gathered UFO information and photographs, etc., much of which seemed to disappear, and then claimed insufficient evidence of alien spacecraft, ufologists got upset. They don't like being lied to. But it wasn't against the law to lie. Some spokesman involved probably did not know the whole truth, and others recognized that national security was more important than their reputation among ufologists. The ufologist may become frustrated, because he has worked long and hard to get information he knows the government has. This sometimes leads to antagonistic attitudes that don't do anybody any good. It is truly unfortunate that the government position contributed to some witnesses being adversely affected by their experience. What we need now is greater understanding and tolerance, so we can channel our efforts to more productive endeavors. FUTURE COOPERATION? We should spend more time (continued on page 18)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PENN STATE SIGHTING By Stan Gordon . iv.- fe-. Recently the MUFON UFO Journal published several articles which have shown indication that unexplained UFO activity in some cases seems to occur at nearly the same time, and in the same general location where observers have reported the passage of a scientifically explainable UFO, such as a bright meteor or a satellite re-entry. This \"covert\" activity should be closely monitored by researchers to see if additional cases of this type are occurring. A recent possible example of this type of activity occurred during the night of June 20th, and the early morning of June 21,1985. It was almost midnight when 8 to 12 bright, reddish- orange lights with contrails following behind, moved in a V-formation from the NW. to the SW. HOTLINE The objects moved very fast across the sky and were in view for only seconds. Many people were taking advantage of the beautiful summer weather, and so the witnesses were plentiful. The Pa. PASU UFO Hotline was jammed until 4 a.m. with calls from both professional and civilian observers who wanted to report their sighting as well as seek an explanation. As we charted the location and the time of observations, it became apparent most reports could be explained. We put in a call to the Space Center division of NORAD, in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado, to see if they had any space junk re-entry that could relate to our reports. They confirmed that at the time we received reports of the UFO formation, the Russian Satellite Cosmos 1530 had broken into several parts (about a dozen) when it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere over the Eastern section of the United States. As we continued to sift through the dozens of phoned-in sighting reports, we found that several observations did not fit in with the satellite re-entry. In the days to follow, other sightings of an unusual nature that occurred this same night would come to our attention. OTHER VIEWS At 11:55 p.m. on June 20th, about 5 minutes before the satellite re-entry, we received an anonymous call from a man who stated that he and several friends near Bethel Park, a suburb of Pittsburgh, had observed a huge, elongated object with multiple blue and white lights, that moved slowly across the sky. It was so large as it passed over them, that it blocked out the sky and stars in that position. (continued on nexf page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PENN UFO, Continued At almost the same time, another witness at Castle Shannon, another nearby suburb, reported a close encounter. The woman was returning from the grocery store and was walking up the steps to her apartment building when she noticed lights moving'slowly just above the roof of the building. As it moved overhead, she was awestruck by the sight of a huge, solid-appearing, oval-shaped object no more than 50 feet above the apartment building. The gray object was estimated to be 300 feet long (the length of a football field) and was covered with many lights that were small in size and dim in brightness. Over the entire surface of the object, were structures that jutted out from the main body, and each structure had a dim light on the end of it. The witness had trouble trying to explain these protruberences, but she indicated that they were like individual compartments. A low whirring sound could be heard as the object slowly moved out of sight toward the East. The object was under observation for several minutes. The next sighting was reported from Jefferson County which is about 90 miles North of Pittsburgh. At approximately 3 minutes after midnight (June 21), two men were driving home on a back road when they observed a very large, glowing, white object about 100 feet above the ground. The object displayed six steady blue lights, and made no sound as it slowly moved ahead of the men who were about 150 feet away. STAR-BLIMP At 12:15 a.m. near Champion, Somerset County, a carload of people returning to their homes from work, claimed to have seen a large round object with lights on it hover low off the ground, then ascend into the sky. But the most interesting sighting of this night occurred at 12:30 a.m. only 5 miles from this location, but in Fayette County. Mr. R. was about 2 miles West of Indianhead when he came over a hill and noticed a cluster of lights that at first he thought was bright stars. As he approached closer he realized that the lights were attached to a large object that at first glance he thought was a blimp. He continued up the road and turned around to take a better look at the object. The object was moving very slowly, and R. tried to flag down a car coming up fast, but it did not stop. The object was crossing the road, and was well over 100 feet long. R. got out of his car to take a better look. At this point the object was on the right side of the road. He yelled toward the object, still thinking it was some type of blimp or balloon. At this time the object began to emit bright blue lights from the bottom. The object was only about 30 feet above the trees and the lights illuminated the trees and the ground below. NO CAMERA There was a trailer on the left side of the road, and the dogs there were barking excitedly. R. ran over to the trailer to ask the people to come out to see this object, and he hoped that they would have a camera. An elderly man came to the door and R. pointed the object out to him. The man said to R., \"I never seen anything like that before,\" and told him he had.no camera and went back into his residence! The object atthis time was moving slowly over the nearby field and R. ran towards it. He stood in the field looking directly up underneath the object trying to see some type of marking or insignia to better identify what he was seeing. After about 5 minutes he decided that he just had to get someone else to witness this, so he ran to his car and headed home where he awoke his parents, and took them back to the field. It took at least 10 minutes to get back to the site, but unfortunately the object was gone. On the way home to get his parents R. kept saying in his head, \"I need a camera.\" R. described the object he saw as elongated, like a blimp. It had a metallic- silver surface and was at least 100 feet long. There appeared to be 6 blue lights in the top section of the object and the entire top seemed to spin in a counter- clockwise motion. At times brilliant blue flashes of light would emit from the top of the object. The bottom of the object appeared to be hollow, judging from the bright blue light it emitted. The object made no noise like an engine; what he heard was \"like something enormous moving through the air.\" R. had the object in view for about 20 minutes and is now baffled by what he saw. He realizes it could not have been a conventional blimp or balloon. Investigation continues into the sightings. The data gathered so far indicates that possibly several UFOs were in the Pennslvania skies this night. We would be interested to hear . from other investigators who have sighting reports under study for this same date.

One of the major purposes of this trip was to learn the current status of research on the Bentwaters Incident, from the perspective of the first investigators of the case. New information has been surfacing on this event, and the best way to clarify matters was a personal meeting with the British researchers. MEETING I met with Jenny Randies and Dot Street (who along with Brenda Butler co-authored Sky Crash, an excellent early study of the case), on October 22, 23, and 24 in London. We had the opportunity to discuss the case at 10 length, and explore recent developments. While nothing has yet been forthcoming to resolve the many questions still surrounding the case, two very interesting new aspects have surfaced. Jenny disclosed that she has been shown correspondence between Colonel Charles Halt (the author of the only official document concerning the incident to surface thus far) and a major British newspaper. The correspond- ence allegedly concerned Halt's efforts to sell his story of the events to this paper. The most significant aspect of this is an offer made by Halt to provide information which may very well lead to another official confirmation of the story. According to Jenny, Halt promised to furnish for the paper a copy of a memorandum from a superior officer at another American base in Britain, endorsing Halt to conduct an investigation on behalf of the United States Air Force. This letter was, according to Jenny, in the private file of a reporter who was handling these \"negotiations\" for the paper. This reporter gave Jenny every indication that she could read this correspondence, but when she asked for a photocopy, he declined.

This, of course is crucial to your Freedom of Information Act requests, because they're flatly denying it (the orders).\" I am currently awaiting a response to an FOIA request which I have filed with the base in question, asking for a copy of this order to investigate. I have also attempted to contact Col. Halt at his new duty station at Kunsan AFB, Korea, to attempt to get some type of comment from him, but have received no response so far. If copies of these orders can be secured through the Freedom of Information Act, it will be another significant step forward in locating other records which eyewitnesses say exist, such as photographs, movie film, etc. Concerning Col. Halt's story for the newspaper-don't hold your breath. One of the provisions Halt requested in the letter, was, according to Jenny, that if he provided the information to the paper, they would not be allowed to print it until his discharge from the Air Force. That of course, is a major stumbling block for the newspaper, and Jenny indicated that negotiations are still ongoing. On yet another front, Jenny Randies has been in contact with a scientist who has made a quite startling statement about the entire event. Dr. Allan Bond, a former British Ministry of Defence scientist, who still occasionally works under contract for the MOD, is an expert on rocket propulsion systems, including nuclear power systems for spacecraft. After reading S/cy Crash, he became intrigued with the case, and contacted Jenny in November of 1984. He made it clear to Jenny from the outset that he didn't necessaryily believe in aliens, but he was willing to try and find out what might have happened. He believed there was another explanation for the events, and that the UFO aspect had been given as a means of covering it up. He indicated he would attempt to make some checks through sources available to him. NUCLEAR REACTOR? Bond phoned Jenny again the next night, and indicated that he did indeed believe that there was something to the case. He seemed to feel, initially, that it may have been the recovery of a part of a satellite which used a nuclear reactor for a power source. He also indicated that he was intrigued with the Cash- Landrum case, which had occurred on approximately the same date as the events at Bentwaters. He indicated that if the information he had heard was correct, both the object at Bentwaters, and the Cash- Landrum object sounded exactly like a SNAP 10-A nuclear reactor. Bond described the SNAP 10-A as conical, about 2 meters by 3 meters. According to Jenny, he said, \"I'm not very happy about getting involved in this, it's a very delicate thing, you know.\" He indicated he.would have to be out of the country on business for a while, but would be in contact with Jenny again, as soon as he returned. When Jenny was able to contact Dr. Bond some time later, he had no more comment to make concerning his satellite recovery theory. I asked Jenny about his response to her, and she replied, \"He was very wary about saying anything. He said, 'Look, I don't really want to delve into this anymore. I've looked, and I'm sure there's something to it, but quite frankly, you're messing with something so serious here, that it is the kind of thing you could easily end up at the bottom of the Thames River for. My advise to you is to let it drop.\" THREAT Dr. Bond indicated he would keep his ears open for any new information he might hear, but that he wasn't going to push too hard. He indicated it \"isn't worth my job or my life.\" The last contact Jenny had with Bond was in June of 1985. He indicated he had. heard nothing new, but had found out from friends in the Ministry of Defence that when the story of the event appeared in the Netus 'of the World in October of 1983, \"Boy, oh, boy, when that story went in the News of the World did you cause a few people trouble.\" Unfortunately, we have no real clarification from Bond if what he discovered really did indicate recovery of a nuclear reactor from a satellite, or something else. I find it is extremely interesting that he would indicate that delving into what had occurred could prove to be a life-threatening (continued on page 18) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MINISTRY OF DEFENCE Sec(AS)2a ' Room 82145 Main Building Whitehall London SW1A2HB Tttophon* 01 -218 (Direct Dialling) 01-218 9000 (Switchboard) Your raferanc* J R Kyniston 1831 S.E.Hawthorne Blvd Portland Oregon 97214  DM Apt.308  ZV June 1985 USA Dear Mr Kyniston ' Thank you for your letter of 25 March 1985. You may find it useful if I explain that the sole interest of the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence in reported sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) is to establish whether they have any bearing on the defence of the country. There is no organisation in the Ministry of Defence appointed solely for the purpose of studying reports of such objects, and no staff are employed on the subject full time. The reports we receive are referred to the staff in the Department who are responsible for the air defence of the United Kingdom, and they examine the reports as part of their normal duties. Since our interest in UFOs is limited to possible defence implications we have not carried out a study into the scientific significance of these phenomena. Unless there are defence implications we do not attempt to identify sightings and we cannot inform observers of the probable identity of the object seen. The Department could not justify the expenditure of public funds on investigations which go beyond the pure defence interests. We have to recognise that there are many strange things to be seen in the sky, but we believe there are adequate explanations for them. They may be satellite debris re-entering the earth atmosphere, ball lightning, unusual cloud formations, meteorological balloons, aircraft lights, aircraft at unusual angles or many other things. The only information we have on the alleged \"UFO sighting\" at Rendlesham Forest in December 1980 is the report by Colonel Charles Halt, of the United States Air Force. We are satisfied that the events described are of no defence significance. I can assure you that there is no question of attempting to cover up any incident or mishap, nor are we attempting in any way to obscure the truth. I enclose a copy of Colonel Halt's report which may be of interest. I attach copies of two recent Parliamentary Questions on the Ministry of Defence's interest in UFO reports, which you may be interested in. Yours sincerely P M HUCKER 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUTE EVIDENCE REVISITED By Richard D. Seifried In the May, 1985 issue of the \"MUFON UFO Journal,\" Robert Wanderer gave an excellent review of Daniel Kagan and Ian Summers' book, Mute Evidence. The response I expected did not appear in the following editions of the MUFON UFO Journal. Just as I did in a CUFOS publication I feel obligated to submit a rebuttal. After searching about for several weeks trying to find where I had placed Mute Evidence, I found it jammed behind other paperbacks. The first time I read it I was somewhat angry with the authors; so much so that I did not read the final chapter. That was a mistake. In reviewing the book a second time I realize that I was also quite unfair to Kagan and Summers. Most of my objection to the paperback was what I considered to be closed-mindedness on the part of the authors. They did not keep an open, scientific attitude. I suspected that they had a pre-conceived conclusion in mind when they began writing. Yet, I had reacted in the same biased manner toward Mute Evidence. OBJECTIONS My basic objections are two in number. I take exception to some of the statements made in the book and secondly, personal experiences will not permit me to totally accept what the book presents. In particular, I do not like how some people are, I think, unfairly treated. During the summer months I work in Montana. In 1980 I was fortunate to meet with Roberta Donovan, co-author of Mystery Stalks the Prairie. Ms. Donovan and I sat at .a kitchen table in her relative's house in Missoula, Montana, and for perhaps two hours we shared ideas and experiences dealing with UFOs. She is a free-lance writer who depends on her writing for a livelihood. I was told how the publishing agreement for Mystery Stalks the Prairie was a disappointment with very limited distribution. She explained how, almost overnight, all of her contacts were cut off. Keith Wolverton, her co- author, said he had been silenced and would loose his job if he made further comments about UFOs or cattle mutilations. It was apparent to me that Ms. Donovan was frustrated. . An investigation was incomplete and she was unable to continue it. Ms. Donovan is a very nice lady. I wish Kagan and Summers had met with her. Although Montana is a great land geographically it is small socially. Everyone seems to know everyone else. Since 1980 I have met several people who know Keith Wolverton personally as well as other members of the Cascade Sheriff's Department. All have reported that the officers are very kind, intelligent, and well-trained professionals. Referring to Mystery Stalks the Prairie, (page 188, Mute Evidence) reads \"...which contained a sensationalized account of these cases.\" This quote was identified as part of The Rommel Report which was analyzed by the authors. On page 190 Kagan and Summers reported, \"The book (Mystery Stalks the Prairie) had been published by a mysterious organization in Montana called the THAR Institute.\" \"Sensationalized accounts... Mysterious organization.\" The implications are apparent. Mystery Stalks the Prairie is discredited without interviewing one of the two authors who wrote the book. BUFFS Although the authors admitted that UFOs had been reported over the missile sites in Montana, very little positive or unbiased words about UFO investigators can be found in Mute Evidence. Terms such as \"...the entire UFO subculture (ref. p. 106),\" \"...UFO buffs...(ref. p. 169),\" and various comments on pages 308-309 are examples of the authors' opinions of those of us who believe in UFOs. They use literary space to describe the mystery helicopter craft, hypnotic regression, and related topics yet they reject said phenomena. On page 487, Kagan and Summers began their summary, Chapter V. The second paragraph exemplifies their attitude toward UFO research.- \"This was the same climate (that the mutilation problem developed in) in which the pseudoscientific teachings of the UFO establishment had been flourishing for decades.\" PHANTOMS This sentence contains what concerns me most. If we accept Mute Evidence as the final word in cattle mutilations, then in all fairness, treating all things as equal, UFOs do not exist and citizens like Walt Andrus, Dr. Hynek, you and I are floundering about, playing games with reality, pursuing phantoms which do not exist. My displeasure of the injustice grows as I write this. My notes tell me that other assumptions are not true. Kagan and Sommers are not fair to two groups of individuals in particular. One group is the law enforcement officials. I think the authors try to be fair but just don't quite make it. The law officers in Montana, for example, impress me with their intelligence and training. The ones I have met and talked with are surprisingly kind gentlemen who grew up in the country they protect. They are big-game hunters and fishermen. They have spent a lifetime in the out-of-doors and know how to read signs, be they a spoor of an animal, a broken blade of (continued next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"EVIDENCE, continued grass, or a wing-flutter imprinted in the snow. They have seen many dead animals, including livestock in various stages of decay. These lawmen recognize the ravages caused by predators. Yet, if we take Mute Evidence to be gospel, these law officers almost to a man, have been duped into believing in a farce called \"cattle mutilations.\" They all, for some reason, eagerly accept untruths and see evidence through clouded eyes because they so eagerly want to believe in cattle mutilations. VETS Veterinarians are also abused. The reader learns that veterinarians are ignorant of conditions of normal deaths and resulting predation. Kagan and Summers report, \"Board-certified pathologisrs are as far away from the average clinical veterinary practitioner as a Sherlock Holmes would be from the cop on the beat in a small town...(ref. p. 187).\" Again there is a derogatroy statement against law officers. The implication is •that \"big city police\" are superior in deductive techniques. Is this really true? Veterinarians who deal exclusively with pet poodles and cats very likely do not have much expertise in the pathological analysis of large animal remains. However, the veterinarians involved in most mutilation cases are men and women who work out in the hills and on the open range. They see hundreds of dead animals and make determinations on causes of death. It is not new to them. They are not individuals who sit in a sterile animal hospital waiting to remove porcupine quills from some hapless canine. Kagan and Summers did put Leland Gade of the \"Montana Farmer- Stockman\" newspaper in the right perspective. Not only did Gade attack the cattle mutilation investigators in 1975 but he also wrote a vitriolic editorial chastizing Captain Wolverton, of the Cascade Sheriff's Office, in a follow-up article published on August 6, 1981. Cade must have made Kagan and 14 Summers wonder, \"Where is this guy coming from? What are his motives? Who is behind him? Are his literary attacks politically, economically, or socially motivated? Are they the result of his own belief that cattle mutilations are simply bunk?\" Chapter V, I think, detracts from an otherwise thought provoking, well- written book. Page 494 contains their conclusive analysis: \"Myths like the cattle mutilation phenomenon are functional mirrors of the concerns of the citizens of a given society at a specific time, and tend to arise during periods of external tension and doubt.\" SOCIAL STRESS Examples given of distress-causing influences include Nixon, Vietnam, Love Canal, Nukes, Inflation, and the Arab Oil Embargo. I can't argue with the fact that such problems overwhelm our senses with futility. However, think back, you older readers, to other supposedly happier, less tense times: World War I. The horrible influenza epidemic of 1918. The Great Depression. World War II. No great explosion of UFO sightings occurred in those days. Cattle mutilations were not in the news. True, in WW-II we did have \"Foo Fighters,\" little glowing balls of light that harrassed our military aircraft. What was to — Photo by Wendy Smith become known as UFOs were beginning to appear in Europe. Kenneth Arnold's famous sighting occurred in 1947, a time of optimism, social stability, a decade of Big Band music, private home-buying on an unprescedented scale, and for the first time higher education for almost anyone who wanted it. Yet Arnold saw strange silver discs in the sky. Does wishful thinking or social anxiety cause radar to track objects across the North American continent at remarkable velocities? What overwhelming social or political event caused a New Guinea church congregation to see a UFO, with \"aliens\" waving down to them? What about UFOs over our Minute Man silos? Hallucinations? Were they a result of military anxiety and misinterpretation brought about by environmental pollution and Watergate? Kagan and Summers' Chapter V, \"Invisible Geography,\" simply does not hold up under careful scrutiny and analysis. Read Mute Evidence if you haven't, but please keep an open mind and an investigative, scientific attitude. Kagan and Summers did separate some considerable untruths, hoaxes and misinterpretation from fact. We should be grateful for their contribution to our understanding of a complex mystery."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"INVISIBLE UFO By Francis Ridge Drawn by Witness \"Mr. B.\" BACKGROUND Mr. B (30) and his male companion, Mr. R (31), were hunting for Indian artifacts on a cool clear day in November (established as the 17th). It was a Saturday and they had begun early, approximately 11:30 that morning. The area in question'is the Wabash River bottoms near Savah, a farming community (very small) near Mt. Vernon, IN to the NW. The event area was 7.5 miles NW of Mt. Vernon and about 20 miles West of Evansville. Across the river to the West is Illinois. SIGHTING At approximately 2:10 PM the men heard a rythmic buzzing sound (similar to a motor boat) and saw an object coming down the river low on the horizon. The object was disc-shaped, greyish - silver (mirrorlike) in appearance, moved fast toward them as it appeared to notice them, stopped overhead for 30-seconds, then departed. Originally, the observer stated the object came from the North going South down the river, saw them, turned East and headed fast toward them. They were approximately 200 yards from the river and in a 500 acre-plowed field. The topo map supplied by the prime witness (amateur archaeologist) gave us a corrected view. The actual path of the UFO was NW to SE, then NE, then headed NW. See drawing of UFO and topo map. The elevation of the object was described as low at first on horizon dropping to 10' overhead, then on departure the elevation increased to about 22 degrees or one-fourth the way up on the horizon. The ojbect, described as \"big as a house,\" \"30' wide\" (drawing suggests 50'), became invisible when overhead, only casting a shadow on the ground. During the 30- seconds overhead the witnesses described the feeling of static electricity; their hair stood on end. the buzzing (pulsing about 2X's per second) was still heard when the object was overhead. The witnesses tried to move out from under it, but were not able. The object was not seen to move away on (continued on page 18) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"A UNIQUE CATALOG By Dr. Willy Smith DEFINITION UNICAT is a sophisticated data base embodying information on UFO sightings, conceived and implemented according to the following directives: A) The data base contains only high-quality cases, where IFOs and questionable material have been eliminated as much as possible. The data base will be universal (hence the name: UNiversal CATalog) i.e., efforts will be made to include cases from as many countries as feasible. B) The data base will be accessible to all those investigators that have actively cooperated in its creation. It will also be accessible to others and to the general public for a nominal charge. O'UNICAT is essentially different from other computerized listings of UFO sightings inasmuch as information on a given case will be continuously added if available. Most computer catalogs — including UFOCAT — terminate the input of information as soon as the entry is completed. On the contrary, UNICAT is dynamic, and the software contains several programs for checking the data base integrity and for finding errors, including typing mistakes. D) The design of UNICAT is such that it allows the retrieval of information in a very large number of ways, including correlations, sortings and even short narratives containing key words for each individual case. The computer output is immediate, directly readable and DOES NOT require a code book. E) A special section will provide the references for each entry in detail. CRITERIA The criteria that a case must meet to be entered in UNICAT are naturally rather stringent, and are summarized as follows: 16 DR. WILLY SMITH -Dennis Stacy 1) At least two witnesses. However, a well-investigated case resting on the testimony of a single unimpeachable witness could be occasionally included. 2) Cases that have been well investigated by known ufologists, preferably those that have been published in the literature in any language. 3) Unpublished cases, or cases investigated by not so well known researchers will be acceptable only if there is a written report accessible to the organizers of UNICAT, and if the initial investigators are willing to provide additional information if requested. 4) The case should contain at least 10 of the parameters or characteristics specified by Dr. Hynek's list. We expect this list to change with time as cases are added to the data base and the truly significant parameters become evident. PURPOSE The overall purpose of UNICAT, besides providing a reliable research tool for all investigators, is to prove by a direct application of the scientific method that UFOs are indeed a new phenomenon, deserving the attention of established science. The progress in the precise determination of the pertinent parameters will lead to a model, or profile, for the UFO phenomenon, furnishing not only an operational definition of it, but also determining the basic paradigm that any science must possess.

A Soviet jet fighter, dispatched on an intercept mission, suffered engine failure upon nearing the UFOs. The pilot ejected as the plane spiraled downward and crashed. The October issue of OMNI reviews Betty Hill's story of her 1961 UFO abduction and subsequent UFO experiences in the Anit-Matter/UFO Update section of the magazine. JOURNAL editor Dennis Stacy contributes an article on the financial perils of UFO research in OMNI's November issue. A fascinating-if-true story of a cattle-killing UFO can be found in the November issue of FATE. The report alleges that a large disc-shaped UFO was seen at close range on a Missouri farm in August, 1896. When the UFO departed, three steers, their bodies completely drained of blood, were found in a patch of burned grass. Several other such incidents are claimed to have occurred in the state at the same time although preliminary newspaper research has failed to substantiate this claim. The same issue of FATE also contains Part 2 of Hilary Evans' article on \"balls of light.\" Bob Girard of Arcturus Book Service has recently published a small booklet detailing his own thoughts on UFOs and the human race's place in the cosmic scheme of things (perhaps with an emphasis on \"scheme\"). Is \"the entire human life cycle...subordinated to the needs of an unperceived macrospecies\"? Is there some sort of conspiracy to \"keep us human,\" as Girard speculates? This is all quite interesting food for thought, even if nothing can be proven, pro or con. In the final chapter of his booklet, Girard makes some very telling points, reminding us of the insanities we take for granted in our \"normal\" lives. As he says, the \"true human\" strives to leave the herd and to experience life from a \"cosmic perspective.\" Agreement with all of Girard's premises is not necessary in order to enjoy reading THE COSMIC SHEEPDOG.

LETTERS OPEN LETTER Dear Jenny Randies: I just finished reading your last exchange with Ian Ridpath in the September, 1985, issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, and I feel compelled to ask you to refrain from pursuing this matter any further. There is no purpose in attempting to have a rational and logical discussion of issues with Mr. Ridpath, as his interest does not lie in finding the truth, but in creating as much controversy and confusion as possible. Like other pseudo-debunkers, he uses whatever information he can think of, banking on the ignorance of the public, which cannot distinguish between milliroentgens per hour and milliroentgens, and finds , nothing suspicious if Venus is in the sky after midnight. He operates by innuendo, changing even the dates of events (\"clearly in error\") to suit his purposes, ignoring the data that demonstrates the lack of substance of his ideas. It is a waste of time to reply to his letters and to the specious arguments put forward in his papers, as this will only provide him with new material to harp on. Like all the other members of the CSICOP club, he will never answer a point directly but will labor around it to fire the argument; and under no circumstances will he admit to having been wrong, even if he has to fib a little — to put it nicely. So, Jenny, I strongly suggest that you ignore his barbs and use your valuable time for your UFO research. Mr. Ridpath and his fellow club members will get what is due them without any help, as has already happened in the cases of the \"Mars connection\" and the \"flying fishing boat\" of New Zealand fame. It is bound to happen to Mr. Ridpath also, unless he sees the light — which I doubt — and realizes that one does not investigate a UFO report by visiting the place years later to play tricks with a TV camera, by not talking to the witnesses and by ignoring all significant information.

(Deliberate hoaxes have been disclosed by Field Investigators when following these procedures.) A few teenagers have the misconception that they can sell UFO photographs to publishers for exhorbitant amounts of money, therefore they try to hoax photographs. A trained Field Investigator can puncture their balloon at the source. Preferably, the photographs should be mailed to MUFON headquarters for analysis along with the prescribed data. PAYMENT Alan R. Smith was 14 years old when he obtained the first known UFO night time color photo. It was investigated and analyzed as related in this article and copyrighted by The Oklahoma Journal. As an example, Alan's photo has been published worldwide in magazines. The most he has ever received is $200 by LOOK and LIFE Magazine in the United States, and FIX in France for reprint rights. His father wisely deposited these checks in a Tulsa bank for Alan's education. The photo made him enough (approximate- ly $500) to pay three semesters of tuition to Northeastern State University at Tahlequah, Okla. and later the University of Tulsa. The press attention to this photo amazed him and led directly to his decision to include journalism in his education. Today, Alan handles public information and marketing for the High Plains Vo-Tech school in Woodward, Okla. and free-lances some for area newspapers. He is now completing work on his master's degree in education from Northeastern State University. Alan and his wife Jamie have three children, Amos, 12, Glory, 10, and Eli, 8. In conclusion, Alan had these comments for Tulsa World staff writer, Ralph Marler relating to UFOs. \"The only serious thought I ever had was it was some type of experimental aircraft. The fact it's from this planet has more certainty for me than anything else. When you get down to it, many people have seen a UFO. I feel many can be explained. I haven't seen one since.\" SECURITY, Continued getting information from UFO witnesses and less seeking information from government agencies. Because of the strict policy of secrecy, our government is handicapped in investigating cases requiring much personal contact, such as abduction cases and those involving physiolog- ical/psychological effects. It is difficult to ask an abductee to submit to hypnosis while denying knowledge of alien presence. So, government agents depend on civilian ufologists to do this for them.. Dr. Niemtzow's medical data bank seems to be a superb effort that could benefit us all. It could shed light on alien actions and on the dangers of proximity to some UFOs. Consideration of information from abductees for possible technical applications, such as the VISIT group has done, also seems like a good idea. However, we may be \"stabbing in the dark\" unless we get guidance by someone who knows more about alien technology than the open literature provides. I would like to see more scientists use UFO reports in brainstorming activities related to future technology in their specialized fields. Maybe, if we develop a less antagonistic attitude toward the government policy on UFOs, government agents could find a way to foster such efforts and to guide our investigations toward the most promising cases. BENTWATERS, Continued experience. We are still left with no definitive answers, only more questions. Because of the confusing nature of this case, and because of lack of space for a full explanation here in the MUFON UFO Journal, it is impossible to delve into any of the other aspects of the investigation. I will, however, give a full examination of the events to date, in my paper to be presented at the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium in June. The important thing to remember, however, is that the case is by no means solved, nor is it even fully investigated. It is, however, an ongoing, active investigation. New avenues of information are opening constantly- hopefully they will all finally converge on the truth. INVISIBLE, Continued the NE \"leg\"; it was still invisible. It appeared in the NE scaring some crows before it headed back the way it came (NW or NNW). The men stayed in the area less than l / 2 hour and headed back to Mt. Vernon, which is about a 20-30 minute casual drive out of the bottoms. They arrived at 5:30 PM with a missing time of approximately 2'/ 2 hours. The prime witness has had reoccurring nightmares of being taken \"up into a dark area\" and being confined \"in a glass container.\" The experience didn't scare him, but his buddy was very upset about it. Editor's Note: This is phase I of the report. Subsequent articles will cover Mr. R's report, the on-site inspection with photographs and the final hypnotic regression of the two witnesses to reconstruct their 2 l / 2 hours of \"Missing Time\".)

It was also emphasized that in spite of increased publishing and mailing costs due to inflation over the past 5 years, the annual membership/subscription dues to the Mutual UFO Network have not been increased since July 1980. The MUFON annual financial report was included with the letter and ballot to Board Members clearly delineating that MUFON could not have financially survived if it was entirely dependent upon the income from the membership/subscription dues. Recognizing that the Journal is the major monthly communication media for our members and readers, it is imperative that the dues structure cover the cost of editing, publishing and mailing your magazine. Profit from the sales of the symposium proceedings could thus be earmarked for capital equipment expenditures (a computer), research and investigations, public education and fixed overhead costs. As a voluntary, not-for-profit, and tax exempt organization, the only salaries paid are to a part-time office secretary and a part-time clerk. The ballot to the Board of Directors consisted of 5 basic questions: (1) Should the Journal accept and publish reputable advertising? (2) Should the Journal retain the present paper stock or utilize magazine stock (slick paper)? (3) Do you feel that the Editor should receive a monthly stipend? (4) If adequate material was available, how many pages should the monthly Journal contain? and (5) Taking into consideration your answers to the above questions, what price do you recommend for the annual membership/subscription dues? Space was allocated for comments and suggestions on the ballot. Since the Mutual UFO Network is governed by a Board of Directors of 17 men and women, their decisions on such matters as the annual membership/subscription dues must prevail. A tabulation of their ballots on the 5 basic questions is as follows: (1) A split decision existed on advertising in the Journal, (2) The present paper stock shall be continued, (3) It was nearly unanimous that the Editor should receive a monthly stipend for his/her services, (4) If adequate material was available, the majority favored increasing the Journal from 20 to 24 pages, and (5) A significant number recommended increasing the annual membership/subscription dues to $25. (Other's suggested $20 to 30.) Based upon the decision of the Board of Directors, the annual membership/subscription dues will be increased to $25 in the United States and a single copy will cost $2.50. Second class mailing to all foreign countries will become $30 in U.S. funds, paid by International Postal Money Order or a check written against a U.S. bank. The special student membership has been eliminated. Since the study of the UFO phenomenon is frequently a family affair, additional members in the same family, that is identical home addresses, may become members for $10 each when one member in the family subscribes at the regular rate, provided they so designate when submitting their dues. These adjusted prices or dues are effective February 1, 1986. * * * It is quite conceivable that there will be a few members who object to the dues increase, since they have been the recipients for the past 5 years of the only monthly UFO magazine in the World selling at such a ridiculously low price. Even with the annual dues increase to $25, each member will be receiving twelve monthly issues as compared to other leading UFO magazines that publish only 6 issues per year for $25 or more. As the World's finest monthly UFO magazine, the MUFON UFO Journal is still the ultimate bargain in UFO literature. As announced in the November issue of the Journal, the Center for UFO Studies discontinued their eight page bi-monthly publication, the CUFOS Associate Newsletter with the June-July 1985 issue, edited by John P. Timmerman. It will be combined with their bi-monthly Internationa} UFO Reporter by adding 4 pages to the IUR and increasing the price for six issues per year to $25 in the U.S.A. Since the International UFO Reporter and theMUFON UFO Journal are the only two UFO organizational magazines still being published in the United States, it is imperative that both revise their financial positions for the future so they will not suffer the fate of the publications of NICAP, APRO and SBI. * * * David A. Bodner, a member since 1975 has been promoted from a State Section Director to State Director for West Virginia, replacing Theodore Spickler who asked to be relieved of this responsibility due to occupational commitments. Mr. Bodner will be seeking a replacement for the southern counties of West Virginia. Mr. Spickler, who is still active, has been invited to become the State Section Director for the four northern West Virginia counties where he resides. James R. Melescuic, State Director for Massachusetts, has appointed Joseph Nyman, a Field Investigator since 1976, to the position of State Section Director for Norfolk County. Joe has a B.A. in Mathematics and is a computer programmer. Stan Smith, D.V.M., living in Honolulu, has (continued on page 19)"}]
