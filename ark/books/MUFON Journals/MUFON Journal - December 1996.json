INTRODUCTION abductions are generally a very strange and complex phenomenon. For skeptics, journalists and the public it is hard to believe that abduc- tions by alien beings have their basis in physical reality. Reports of alien beings en- tering bedrooms through walls, levitating abductees through closed windows and into a waiting craft are hard for the open- minded researcher to believe, too. However, well respected researchers have shown that the core of the UFO-abduction phenomena cannot be explained psycho- logically, as hallucinations or mass delu- sions [1]. The passing decades of abduc- tion research brought other changes. Recently, some UFO abductees have al- leged that they were also being kidnapped by military/intelligence personnel (MI- LAB) and taken to hospitals and/or mili- tary ground/underground facilities. Few of the popular books on the subject of UFO abductions mentioned these expe- riences. Especially disconcerting is the fact that abductees recalled seeing mili- tary/intelligence personnel working side by side with alien beings in these secret facilities. The presence of human military and/or civilian personnel inhabiting the same physical reality as the alien beings exceeds both the mindsets of the skeptic and open-minded researcher alike by sev- eral orders of magnitude. The skeptics would rather believe that stories of aliens and military personnel in government un- derground facilities are fabrications de- signed to elicit attention from conspiracy believers or hallucinations in general. Researchers in the field of mind control suggest that these cases are evidence that the whole UFO abduction phenomenon is staged by the intelligence community as a cover for their illegal experiments [2]. The open-minded researchers who fight for a reputation in abduction research ignore these stories, since they represent only a minor fraction in their files [3]. I think that abduction cases in which the abductee reports that he/she was also abducted by the military are very important for two reasons: 1.) If the UFO community has evidence that a covert military/intelligence task force is involved in the UFO abduction phenomenon, we would then know that this phenomenon represents a matter of na- tional security. 2.) The alleged military involvement in the abduction phenomenon could be evi- dence that they use abductees for mind control experiments, as test-targets for mi- crowave weapons, or that they monitor and kidnap abductees for information-gather- ing purposes during a UFO abduction ex- perience. If one of these points is correct, one can expect to run into early resistance when proposing congressional hearings about UFOs. For these reasons I started Project MILAB and present in this article my pre- liminary findings. MILAB is the acronym for Military Abductions of alleged UFO abductees. I reviewed the relevant litera- ture, contacted UFO and mind control re- searchers, MILAB abductees and mind control victims all over the world and com- pared my findings with the comprehensive UFO Abduction Study of Dr. Thomas Bullard [4, 5], the MUFON Transcription Project [6, 7] and the MIT Abduction Proceedings [1]. II. Helicopter activity in connection with MILABs My study indicates that, generally, MILABs are harassed by dark, unmarked helicopters around their houses. The mys- terious helicopter activity goes back to the late sixties, early seventies, when they showed an interest in animal mutilations but not for alleged UFO abductees [8, 9, 10]. However, well known researcher Raymond E. Fowler reports mysterious helicopter activity in connection with UFO witnesses during the seventies [11]. Dr. Dr. Lammer is a scientist with the Austrian Space Research In- stitute. He is the Austrian repre- sentative for the Mutual UFO Network, a MU- FON consultant in geophysics, and a member of the Society for Scientific Ex- ploration (SSE).

December 1996 Number 344 Page 4 Thomas Bullard compared 270 UFO ab- duction cases worldwide between 1868 and 1984, the majority of which occured during the seventies and early eighties [4, 5]. There are only four abduction cases in Dr. Bullard's study in which the abductees saw helicopters over or near their houses Among these cases is the well invesii^MUd Betty Andreasson/Luca abduction [r ii important to note that these helicopter cases occured in North America, three of them in the USA and one in Canada. There were sightings of mysterious heli- copters in England during the seventies, but not in connection with animal mutila- tions or UFO abductions [12]. I found that helicopter activity reported in connection with UFO abductions has tended to increase from the eighties up to the present. Dan Wright has presently ten cases in the MUFON Transcription Project files in which helicopters were seen flying in the area of the abductee's home within hours of an alleged abduction [7]. On aver- age, many abduction researchers in North America have about three helicopter cases in connection with UFO abductions in their files. It appears to me that this is a North American phenomenon, since none of the contacted researchers in Australia, Africa, Europe and South America have well in- vestigated abduction cases in connection with alleged helicopter activity. Well known abductees like the before mentioned Betty Andreasson/Luca, or Debby Jordan, Kathy Mitchell, Whitley Strieber, Leah Haley, Katharina Wilson, Beth Collins, Anna Jamerson and many more were harassed by these phantom heli- copters [e.g., 1 3 N 15 16, 17, 20]. It is not justified to Miguosi ihat these heli- copters represeni ilu black Cadillacs of the Men in Black (MlBj during the nineties [4], since some abductees have photos of them and they were also seen by witnesses who have nothing to do with the UFO phe- nomenon, [e.g., 10, 13, 18]. It seems as if these unmarked helicopters operate for some sort of secret military/intelligence task force, whereas the MIB phenomenon seems to be of paranormal origin and re- lated to the UFO phenomenon. Let us sum- marize the helicopter topic in five points: 1.) The helicopter mystery starts during the late sixties, early seventies, in connec- tion with animal mutilations. 2.) During these times the agenda be- hind the helicopters showed a minor inter- est in UFO abductees. 3.) The helicopters began to increase their interest in UFO abductees during the eighties up to the present, but were also re- ported near animal mutilation sites and other areas in northern America. 4.) At present, many North American abduction researchers have some cases in their files. 5.) There were reports of phantom heli- copter activity in England during the sev- enties, but it seems that their interest in an- imal mutilations and abductees is limited to North America. III. Alleged kidnappings by military/intelligence personnel Most abductees report the involvement of military/intelligence personnel after the helicopters began to appear. Debby Jordan reports, for instance, in a side note of her book Abducted! [13] that she was stunned by an alleged friend and brought to a kind of hospital where she was examined by a medical doctor, who removed an implant from her ear! The abduction experiences of Leah Haley and Katharina Wilson are full of MILAB encounters [15, 16]. Some of Katharina Wilson's experiences are comparable with mind control experi- ments. She experienced a flashback from her childhood in which she remembered being in a hospital where she was forced into a Skinner Box-like container which was possibly used for behaviour modifica- tion experiments. She subsequently pub- lished an excellent article on her Web- page with the title: \"Are Some Alien Abductions Government Mind Control Experiments?\" [19] Beth Collins and Anna Jamerson include hypnosis tran- scripts of an abduction by human military people in their book Connections [17], and the late Dr. Karla Turner investigated MILABs in her books, Into the Fringe and Taken: Inside the Alien-Human Abduction Agenda [20]. A worldwide survey revealed that most North American abduction researchers have on average 2-5 MILAB cases in their files. At present, it seems to me that there are no UFO-related MILABs in Australia, South America, Africa, Europe, England, or Ireland. By comparing typical UFO ab- duction scenarios as described in Dan"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Wright's MUFON Transcription Project with 10 well investigated MILAB victims (Casey Turner, Katharina Wilson, Leah Haley, Debby Jordan, and Polly, Pat, Lisa, Beth, Angie, Amy 1 ), one finds some differences between abductions by alleged alien beings and military/intelligence per- sonnel. MILABs involve the following ele- ments: Activity of dark, unmarked heli- copters, the appearance of strange vans or buses outside the houses of abductees, ex- posure to disorienting electromagnetic fields, drugging, transport with a heli- copter, bus or truck to an unknown build- ing or an underground military facility. Usually there are physical aftereffects, like grogginess and sometimes nausea after the kidnappings. There is also a difference when the abductors appear. In most UFO abduction cases, the beings appear through a closed window or wall, or the abductee feels a strange presence in the room. Most abductees report that they are paralysed from the mental power of the alien beings. In MILABs, the abductee reports that the kidnappers give him or her a shot with a syringe. It is interesting, that MILAB expe- riencers report that they are examined by human doctors in rectangular rooms and not in round, sterile rooms—as in descrip- tions of UFO abductees [4, 5, 6, 7]. The described rooms, halls and furniture are similar to terrestrial hospital rooms, labo- ratories or research facilities and have nothing to do with UFO furniture. The examination is somewhat similar to UFO abductions: the MILAB victim is not paralysed, but tied to an examination table or a gynecological chair. Sometimes, the abduciec gel 1 - n strong drink before an ex- amination This is perhaps a contrast-en- hancing fluid. MILAB doctors are mostly dressed in white labcoats and show an in- terest in implants and/or gynecological ex- aminations. In some MILAB cases a mili- tary doctor allegedly searches for implants and sometimes implants the abductee with a military device. Therefore, surgeons seeking alleged alien implants should also be prepared to possibly find military de- vices, too. 1 Names in italics are pseudonyms and taken from Dr. Karla Turner's books [20]. IV. Terrestrial implants To date, more than three million animals worldwide have been successfully fitted with an implantable transponder manufac- tured by Destron-Fearing [21]. The im- plantable transponder is a passive radio- frequency identification tag, designed to work in conjunction with a compatible ra- dio-frequency ID reading system. The transponder is activated by a low-fre- quency radio signal, then it transmits the ID code to the reading system. The small- est transponder is about the size of an un- cooked grain of rice. The transponder's tiny electronic circuit is energized by the low-power radio beam sent by a compati- ble reading device. A similar bio-chip for humans was de- veloped by Dr. Daniel Man in the USA. Dr. Man has held a US patent for a homing de- vice that can be implanted in humans since 1989 [22]. He developed the implant for solving the missing children problem. This device is slightly larger than the Destron implant, which can be simply injected with a special syringe. Dr. Man's implant re- quires a small surgical incision instead. It is important to note that Dr. Man claims that the best location for his implant may be behind the ear. MILAB reporters like Debby Jordan or Leah Haley claim that doctors removed implants from their ears! Dr. Man says that the device is powered by a small battery, which can be routinely charged with a device that is held outside the body near the location of the implant. Authorities would use three satellites or specially equipped helicopters if they want to find or monitor a person. By using trian- gulation to follow the signal of the im- plant, satellites or helicopters could pin- point the implant's exact location. Before Dr. Man's device becomes available for use in humans in the USA, it will have to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. An agency interested in monitoring physiologic information about an abductee during an UFO abduction experience would use biomedical telemetry. Biomedical telemetry is defined as a spe- cial area of biomedical instrumentation that permits transmission of physiologic information from an often inaccessible lo- cation to a remote monitoring site [23]. The transmitting unit can be implanted [12] Clarke, David, and Watson, Nigel: Phantom Helicopters over Britain. Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), P.O. Box 277, Mount Rainer, Maryland 20712, USA.

By using telemetric sys- tems as a method of monitoring abductees, the military could obtain physiological data, such as respiration, muscle tension, monitor the presence of adrenaline in the bloodstream, and so on. Research in observation and control of human behaviour and its possible use in re- habilitation and control has been con- ducted since the sixties. National Security experts like Dr. Steven Metz and Dr. James Kievit predicted in their report The Revolution in Military Affairs and Conflict Short of War for the US Army War College, that in the near future every American at risk could be equipped with an electronic individual position locator device (IPLD) [24]. They suggested that such a device could be permanently im- planted under the skin, with automatic re- mote activation, say, upon departure from the USA while passing through a security screening system at the airport. The pre- dictions of these national security experts resemble the plans of Dr. Joseph A. Meyer, a computer specialist of the National Security Agency (NSA). Dr. Meyer pro- posed in the seventies attaching transpon- ders to Americans arrested for a crime [2]. During the late fifties, early sixties, neu- roscientist Dr. Jose Delgado invented the stimoceiver, an electrode capable of re- ceiving and transmitting electronic signals via FM radio waves. Such a device im- planted in the brain via the sinus cavities, for example, will act as a powerful stimu- lant when activated by FM radio waves. One can suggest that the stimoceiver has since been modified to receive stimulation from microwave pulses and is capable of wielding a surprising degree of control over the implanted victim's response mechanisms [25]. Implants were being used on unwitting persons as early as fifty years ago. One well documented case of the implantation of an electronic device into a victim is the case of Robert Naeslund. Mr. Naeslund claims that he was unwittingly implanted during an operation in Stockholm, Sweden. He has X-rays which show clearly a mush- room-shaped device in his brain. He claims that the operation was performed by Dr. Curt Strand, who inserted the device in his head through the right nasal passage [26]. Interestingly, UFO abductees since the six- ties have reported how alien beings im- planted small objects up their nose through the nasal passage and sinus cavity. The transnasal approach of implants is in com- mon use in Neurosurgery [28, 29, 30, 31]! Robert Naeslund is not the only victim. He is now a researcher of Gruppen, an organi- zation against illegal mind control experi- ments. Gruppen and other organizations like the Freedom of Thought Foundation have collected a lot of evidence that a se- cret implantation program is going on [26, 27]. These organizations are in contact with many victims all over the world who have reported similar effects as Naeslund but have nothing to do with the UFO com- munity. V. Virtual Reality Scenarios and microwave hearing It appears that some experiences of UFO abductees and mind control victims may be explained by an advanced virtual reality technology. The late Dr. Karla Turner called these experiences Virtual Reality Scenarios (VRS) [19, 20]. There are al- leged mind control victims who claim that someone implants pictures in their brain [32]. If someone has been implanted with an intracerebral device, then the implant operators may be able to electronically im- plant pictures and memories into the brain of the abductee. The New World Vistas was a major undertaking for the USAF Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) [33]. This military publication was published in June 1996 and is a forecast of possible mil- itary developments over the next 50 years. In it military scientists suggest the devel- opment of electromagnetic energy sources, the output of which can be pulsed, shaped, focused, and coupled with the human body in a fashion that will allow one to prevent voluntary muscular movements, control emotions and actions, produce sleep, trans- mit suggestions, interfere with both short- term and long-term memory, and produce an experience set or delete an experience set. The military scientists argue that the concept of imprinting a virtual reality ex- perience act is highly speculative, but nonetheless highly exciting. If such a tech- nology was developed in secret and exists today, the remarkable vividness of some abduction accounts may be explained by the implantation of an experience set into the brain of an abductee."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Dr. Joseph Sharp and Allen Frey experi- mented with microwaves trying to transmit spoken words directly into the audio cortex via pulsed microwaves. Dr. Prey's work in this field, dating back to the sixties, gave rise to the so-called Frey Effect, which is commonly known as microwave hearing [34, 35]. Again, alleged alien abductees and mind control victims report that they sometimes hear voices in their heads, al- though they are not schizophrene. Certainly these scenarios cannot be the case for all UFO abductions, like multiple abductions, but it may explain a small por- tion, or may play a significant role in MILABs. VI. Otherworldly Journeys and mili- tary underground facilities It is interesting to note, that seven ab- ductees of my test sample claim that they were allegedly transported to a military un- derground facility. The research of Dr. Richard Sauder showed that almost every federal agency or military institution has several secret underground facilities all over the USA. Some of these facilities are so secret, that there are only rumors about their existence [36]. We should be aware that Otherworldly Journeys to strange un- derground places are common in UFO ab- ductions. Dr. Thomas Bullard found a spe- cific pattern in Otherworldly Journeys [4, 5]. 1.) Preparation: The alien beings put the abductee into a protective environment for the trip. 2.) Travel: Actual transit to the Other- world occurs. 3.) Underground: The abductee passes underground. 4.) Landscape: The abductee sees the surface of the Otherworld. 5.) Museum: The tour of the Otherworld includes a stop at a museum or zoo. Dr. Bullard's study includes ten UFO abduction cases in which the abductee ex- perienced an Otherworldly Journey with an underground setting during their UFO ab- ductions. A typical Otherworldly Journey is Betty Andreasson's experience in 1950. She reported that a UFO plunged into the sea and came out again, then entered huge crystalline caverns which broadened into a vast underworld. Less frequently, the ex- amination occurs in the Otherworld. During a 1967 abduction experience, Betty Andreasson passed through a long dark tunnel like a mine shaft cut out of rock. Dr. Gilda Moura informed me that she investi- gated UFO abduction cases where ab- ductees report Otherworldly Journeys into underground caves in Brazil. However, these Otherworldly Journeys are not comparable to well-investigated MILAB underground cases. The Otherworldly Journey experiences have a mystical touch, while the MILAB under- ground experiences seem to be a manifes- tation in our reality. MILAB abductees de- scribe elevators, hallways, generators, con- ference and medical rooms. Contrary to ex- periences during Otherworldly Journeys, if a MILAB abductee is kidnapped to an un- derground facility the abductors examine the victims there. Some abductees report Otherworldly Journeys and MILAB experi- ences separately [16, 20]. Beth, an ab- ductee from Dr. Turner's book, Taken: Inside the Alien-Human Abduction Agenda, described flashbacks that started with her seeing a small flying disc, then entering into a well lit underground city [20]. The craft flew on through a tunnel passage into an enormous cavern that con- tained several buildings. UFOs were parked in various locations and alien be- ings were working side by side with human military personnel. In her next flashback Beth flew somehow through a body of wa- ter, into a tunnel and then emerged from a lake. Such flashbacks should be investigated very carefully, since they could be a mix- ture of an Otherworldly Journey (entering a well lit underground city) and a MILAB underground experience (seeing military personnel). It is also important to note that some abductees have flashbacks during which they see aliens and military person- nel together, but during hypnosis the ab- ductee remembers only the military per- sonnel [15, 37]. Perhaps the abductee mixed a UFO abduction experience and a MILAB scenario, or the abductee under- went some kind of hypnoprogramming by military psychiatrists during the kidnap- ping. Perhaps the military uses something like Electronic Dissolution of Memory (EDM), which is accomplished by elec- tronically jamming the brain, causing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to create static which blocks out sight and sounds. After this mind-control procedure a MI- LAB abductee would have no memory of [25] Bowart, H., Walter: Opera- tion Mind Control: Our Secret Govern- ment's War Against its Own People.

The mind of the abductee would be blank [2, 19, 251. VII. Discussion We must also consider the possibility that some of the information we are getting from MILAB abductees may be cover sto- ries, induced by the hypnoprogramming processes of military psychiatrists. There is also the possibility that the military per- sonnel use rubber alien masks and special effects during a MILAB. Katharina Wilson reports flashbacks in which she thinks she held a rubber mask of an alien in her hands [19]. This facts leads some mind control researchers to believe that all alien ab- ductees are used in secret mind control and/or genetic experiments, staged by a powerful black arm of the US government [2]. However, I found some arguments against these claims: 1.) If all UFO abductions are indeed a cover for secret mind control or genetic ex- periments like the Lebensborn Project of the Nazis [38], why do abductees report military/intelligence involvement only since the early eighties, but not before? We should see the opposite in this pattern, since the mind control technology should be much better in the nineties than during the sixties and seventies! 2.) Why are there mind control victims who are implanted and used for secret weapons tests, but have nothing to do with the UFO phenomenon or alien abductions? It seems to me that the mind control agenda doesn't need UFO abductions as a cover story, since nobody believes the claims of ordinary mind control victims, although they have X-rays in which every- one can see anomalous objects in their heads. 3.) If all UFO abductions are a cover for mind control experiments, why is the mili- tary interested in gynecological examina- tions of female abductees too? Of course serious researchers should in- vestigate all possibilities and some UFO abductees may indeed be mind control vic- tims or used in black genetic experiments since the eighties or before, but I think that there exists another possibility for a motive which is more plausible for the military in- volvement in the UFO abduction phenome- non, since it describes the MILAB pattern better. Therefore, my preliminary hypothe- sis of alleged military kidnappings of UFO abductees is: M ILABs may be evidence that a secret military/intelligence task force has been in operation in North America since the early eighties, and is involved in the monitoring and kidnapping of alleged UFO abductees. In the beginning of the eighties a lot of money became available under black budgets for top secret military pro- jects like the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). This task force might be financed by a portion of this money. It seems to me that they are interested in well investigated UFO abduction cases. They are monitoring the houses of their victims, kidnapping and possibly implanting them with military de- vices sometime shortly after a UFO abduc- tion experience. It appears to me that they are searching for possible alien implants, too. Their gynecological interest in female abductees could be explained if they are searching for alleged alien/hybrid em- bryos, since many of the abducted females report missing embryo/fetus experiences. It seems equally probable that the force, or the people who are behind these kidnap- pings, employ advanced mind control tech- nology which is currently being tested ille- gally on people who have nothing to do with UFO abductions.

He called to tell me that he had a video of some strange lights that had been recorded by a special \"GEODS\" telescope system on Mt. Haleakala which is on the Island of Mauai in Hawaii. He wondered if I would be willing to analyze it. He said there were three bright lights which crossed the field of view and that initially it was thought these were lights on an airplane, but then the people who first saw the video noticed that star images passed between the lights with- out blinking so they thought that perhaps it wasn't a plane after all. Sometime, he didn't say when, after the video was first seen in early December, 1993, someone in the Air Force, he wouldn't say who, had passed along a copy of the unclassified video to ABC. Jay went on to say that, because of all the interest (or hype) surrounding the film \"Independence Day,\" Nightline was going to do a show on UFOs and SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and he won- dered if I would be willing to appear in the show. I said \"sure\" and \"when can I see the video,\" or words to that effect. He re- sponded that I couldn't see the video until the taping of my segment because he wanted to get my reaction to seeing the video for the first time. I was a bit irked at that because I knew he would be asking me to base a conclusion on \"instantaneous analysis,\" hardly a scientific way to ap- proach the situation. Since I couldn't see the video I asked him for as many details as he knew. He did not know much. He said it took several seconds for the lights to cross the field of view which he thought was about 2 degrees. He also said that the tele- scope was pointed at or near the horizon. I asked for the name of a person to call so I could learn more details, but he wouldn't give me a name. I therefore asked him to re- contact his source and find out everything he could about the telescope and where it was pointed. We had some difficulty in setting up the exact date and time for the interview. In sub- sequent conversations, as we tried to specify the interview date, Jay told me that he had contacted someone involved with the project which took the video. He now believed that the field of view was probably 5 1/2 degrees rather than the originally mentioned value of 2 degrees, but he couldn't be certain because there are several telescopes on Mauai and he didn't know which one had taken the video. The big day came over a week later, on July 11, 1996.1 arrived at the ABC studio in Washington. D.C. equipped with a ruler, a calculator and a pad of paper. Although I had only sparse information I was deter- mined to do the best analysis I could under the circumstances.

December 1996 Number 344 Page 10 me I knew I would be able to estimate the angular velocity and angular spacing of the lights. Knowledge of these angular quanti- ties might allow me to reject, or at least set limits on, the various potential explanations. As soon as the camera crew set up the TV monitor and video machine I began running the video over and over. Text at the begin- ning of the video stated that it was taken by a GEODS telescope during the year 1993 on day 335 at 032444Z (335th day of the year, December 1, at Greenwich Mean Time of 3:22:24 AM which corresponds to 5:22:24 PM, November 30 in Hawaii). I determined that it took almost exactly 3 seconds for the lights to cross the field of view (FOV), from left to right, in a straight line tilted slightly upward. This corresponded to an angular rate of 1.83 degrees/sec or 0.032 rad/sec. (Note: 1 degree = 0.0174 radians or 0.0174 rad. Multiply the angle in rad or the angular rate in rad/sec by the distance to get size or speed as measured perpendicular to the line, of sight.) There were three lights, equally spaced and traveling in parallel with the cen- tral light a bit ahead of the lights above and below. I measured the length of the image of each bright light and found it corresponded to an angular size of about 0.005 rad while the angular spacing between the upper and lower lights was about 0.01 rad. Close to the central bright light were two much fainter lights, one above and one below. Hence there were a total of five lights (3 strong, 2 weak) traveling through the FOV of the telescope. If I had known the distance to the lights I could have calculated the actual size and ve- locity (perpendicular to the line of sight) from the measurements I had made. Unfortunately there was no way to determine the distance from the available information. A fter watching the video several times and ^\\thinking about it I gained the distinct im- pression that if the information I had been given were correct (5.5 degree FOV; tele- scope pointed at or close to the horizon), then both the airplane and meteor hypotheses had problems. The images of the lights were spaced too far apart to be from an airplane near the horizon unless it was extremely close to the telescope and had a very large wingspan, but in this case it would also be traveling very slowly. On the other hand, if the images were meteors the angular speed was too low unless they were so far away that they might be outside the sensible at- mosphere, in which case they wouldn't glow. Whether either of these potential explana- tions was correct, or if neither was, de- pended upon the actual angle of elevation of the telescope: was it pointed exactly at the horizon? Was it pointed 5 or 10 degrees or more above the horizon? Unfortunately I didn't learn the answer to this important question until many weeks later. Dr. Michael Guillen, the science corre- spondent for ABC TV, was the interviewer. The first thing I said to him after being intro- duced and well before the cameras were \"rolling,\" was \"This is the worst investiga- tion I have ever done.\" I said that because I had never before made a public statement about a potential UFO case without first car- rying out an investigation that at least in- cluded talking to the witnesses. (I realized that no one had actually seen the objects at the time of the taping since the video had been recorded automatically, but I knew that someone associated with the project could answer the technical questions.).! then let Michael wait a bit while I did some calcula- tions of angular sizes and speeds. At the bot- tom of my note pad I wrote \"Distance not actually known, nor (angular) elevation of camera (telescope). Hence can do no more than make educated guesses.\" Michael spent 30 minutes or more trying to get me to identify the lights. We played the video over and over as we both watched. The failure of one star image in particular to dis- appear when it passed between the upper and middle bright lights (where the wing of an aircraft would block the star) was obvious to both of us, as it had been to Jay. This seemed to be strong evidence that the lights were not connected by an opaque body, namely, the wing of an airplane. However, ( I pointed out that we couldn't be certain because the fail- ure of the star image to dim very briefly might have been some artifact of the camera electronics or the recording mechanism about which we knew next to nothing. Michael told me that he had shown the video to Dr. Robert Nathan, formerly of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a long-time UFO analyst with whom I have worked on UFO photos and videos over the last 20 years. Jay and Michael had been rather surprised when Robert had immediately identified the lights as meteors without any analysis other than viewing the video. I told Michael I was suspicious of the meteor explanation (for the reason given above) but that 1 could not be sure whether or not it was correct without knowing the angular elevation of the tele-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL scope. Furthermore, I doubted that a meteor which had broken into three parts before en- tering the FOV would have three nearly equally sized pieces that could travel in paral- lel at exactly the same rate and could travel without creating a trail of burning particles. Finally, after many minutes of seeming to attempt to \"browbeat\" me into making some positive identification (perhaps he hoped I would claim it was a real UFO), Michael asked me how the video ranked in terms of credibilty and strangeness and I said that the video had a high degree of both but that it would have to remain \"a big question mark.\" During the evening after I left the ABC station I began the real investigation. I hoped to have a definite answer before the video was shown nationally on Nightline. Unfortunately, that was not to be. After a more careful theoretical analysis I was able to put more specific restrictions on the potential explanations. It became appar- ent that if the telescope were within 10 de- grees of the horizon the meteor hypothesis could explain the angular velocity, although it still couldn't explain the constant speed along parallel tracks without any sign of a meteor trail. Similarly, if the telescope were within 10 degrees of the horizon the airplane hypothesis was unlikely because the angular size and angular speed would only be con- sistent with a very large aircraft flying (well over 100 ft wingspan) at a very low speed (100 mph or lower) at a short distance from the telescope (a mile or less). The upshot of this analysis was that if the telescope were pointed close to the horizon the suggested explanations were severely strained if not simply unacceptable. Hence the possibility that one — or three, or five — UFOs were involved had to be considered. It all de- pended upon the angular elevation of the telescope, which I did not know and which I was not able to learn before Nightline showed the video on July 16. Because I had to locate the telescope op- erators by asking for help from other people it took well over a month to get the \"real data.\" The crucial information turned out to be far different from what I had been led to believe. I had been told by Lamonica that the angular elevation was low, maybe sev- eral degrees (\"near the horizon\"). However, I learned from the operators that the actual angular elevation was much greater and, in fact, was nearly straight up (85 degrees). I also learned that the telescope was about 10,000 ft above mean sea level (AMSL). T his put a whole new light on the matter. It took me all of five minutes (or less) to determine that under this circumstance the lights could be on an aircraft of some nomi- nal wingspan traveling at several hundred mph at a reasonable cruising altitude above the telescope. In fact, any combination of wingspan, W in ft, speed S in ft/sec and height H in ft AMSL which obeys the rela- tions S/(H-10,000) = 0.032 rad/sec and W/[H-10,000] = 0.01 rad would work. (Note: since the telescope is at 10,000 ft AMSL, the assumed H should be no lower than, say, 11,000 ft. Also, the assumed H should be no greater than 45,000 ft which is an upper altitude for typical aircraft). For ex- ample, if H = 20,000 ft AMSL the wingspan could be W = 0.01 (20,000 - 10,000) = 100 ft and the speed could be S = 0.032 (20,000 - 10.000) = 320 ft/sec or 220 mph. Similarly, the video would be consistent with a plane having a wingspan of W = 40 ft and a speed of S = 128 ft/sec = 87 mph providing it were flying only about 4,000 ft above the tele- scope at H = 14,000 ft AMSL. Naturally there are many (an infinite) number of possi- ble combinations of W, S and H that would satisfy the requirements of the video. The telescope operators told me that, upon seeing the video, they had immediately suspected that it was an airplane, but then they questioned that explanation because they rarely, if ever, see an airplane overfly- ing the telescope installation. One of the men called the FAA to find out if there was any record of an airplane scheduled to fly over Mt. Haleakala at the time of the video. He was told there was no such record (no air route passes over the mountain). Of course, an aircraft could have flown over the moun- tain without the FAA having a record of its exact flight path. One aspect of the imagery seemed to di- rectly contradict the airplane hypothesis: at one time a star image appears to pass \"through\" the space between the bright cen- tral lights and the upper \"wing\" light. This had been pointed out to me by Lamonica as evidence against the aircraft hypothesis be- cause one would expect the star to be mo- mentarily blocked by a solid wing. When I first saw the video I wondered whether or not that could be explained as an artifact of the electronics. Subsequently I learned from the telescope operators that the nature of the image forming and capturing electronics (RCA ISIT microchannel plate and image scan device — like a vidicon — plus a scan A UFO is as a UFO does. If a UFO does nothing that an IFO (iden- tified flying object) could not do, then there is no reason to call it a UFO.

CONCLUSION A UFO is as a UFO does. If a UFO does nothing that an IFO (identified flying object) could not do, then there is no reason to call it a UFO. In this case it appears that an air- plane would be consistent with the observa- tional evidence. Although I can not prove there was an airplane flying over the tele- scope, there is no reason to believe that an airplane could not have done so. Since there is no evidence in the video which conclu- December 1996 Number 344 Page 12 sively contradicts the airplane hypothesis there is no good reason to claim that the lights were something else. An example of the opposite situation, where an unidentified object does something a conventional object could not do under the conditions of observation, is recorded in a daylight video taken July 21, 1995 in Gulf Breeze, Florida. This video shows an oddly shaped object, nearly rectangular in outline and brownish colored, of roughly 30 ft width, looking nothing like an airplane or a helicopter or a balloon/blimp, which re- verses its direction of travel from roughly 500 mph rightward to about the same speed leftward (a 1,000 mph velocity change) in about 1/3 of a second (over 100 g's of accel- eration!). There is no man-made or naturally occurring object in the sky which can accomplish such a feat under the conditions of this ob- servation. Hence the object re- mains a True UFO.

Powell, Byron D. Varner, Walter Andrus A s we approach the fiftieth anniver- sary of ufology or what is known as the modern era of flying saucers, sightings by competent witnesses prior to 1947 become more significant. With the permission of the writer, Byron D. Varner, of the privately published book Living on the Edge: An American war hero's daring feats as a Navy fighter pilot, civilian test pilot, and CIA mercenary, and interviews with the author and principal, Rolan D. Powell by Walt Andrus, the following arti- cle was composed. Mr. Varner served as a Navy Public Affairs Officer during the last thirteen years of his naval career. \"There are old pilots and there are bold pilots, but there are no old bold pilots.\" The U.S. Navy used slogans like these to emphasize the importance of flight safety when Byron D. Varner was an aviation cadet during World War II. That particular one stayed embedded in his mind through- out his flying experience because he saw many would-be heros kill themselves trying to be bold pilots. Mr. Varner hadn't thought of this slogan for a long time until he met Rolan D. Powell, the only \"old\" pilot he ever knew who totally disproved it. Mr. Powell retired as a Lt. Cdr. USNR after not only serving in World War II aboard the air- craft carrier U.S.S. Yorktown, but also in Korea and Vietnam on other assignments. On November 29, 1996, Rolan celebrated his seventieth birthday. The following narrative begins on page 72 of the Varner/Powell books. His parents are relieved to learn that Rolan will be at Naval Air Station, Pasco, Washington, for the next few months. They try not to think about his going back to the war zone, and make him promise to come home as often as possible on weekends. Several former shipmates arrive at NAS Pasco when he does, along with a number of new pilots untested by war. The Navy selected them to form a new air group and prepare for carrier operations in the Pacific. Rolan looks forward to imparting his exper- tise to the new pilots recently out of flight training. It will require daily practice in air tactics, maneuvers, bombing, strafing, dog- fighting, gunnery, and other tricks of the trade necessary for air combat. A lot of fly- ing. For certain he will try to impress upon them the importance of survival tactics. The base has another mission for the experienced pilots, as well. About 60 miles away stands the Hanford plant, its atomic activities known to only a very few. These battle-scarred veterans are to protect that plant in the event of an air attack. Although they don't know what this is all about, they will follow orders, as military people are taught. The standby aircraft are always armed and ready to defend the plant, although few pilots seriously believe it will ever come under enemy attack, given the current state of Japan's diminishing effectiveness. But, like the shark attack that Rolan never expected to face, an air emergency does occur. It is noon time, and no planes are in the air. The bullhorn's jarring sound of General Quarters sends the pilots rushing to the \"There are old pilots and there are bold pilots, but there are no old bold pilots.\" Rolan Powell as a McDonnell Douglas test pilot.

Radar had detected a fast-moving object that is now in a holding pattern directly above the Hanford plant. It is extremely high and Rolan can't see it at first. As they rapidly increase altitude the pilots all spot it at about the same time and head directly for its position. None of them can recognize it, but they can see it well from their vantage point. It has a saucer-like appearance, is bright, extremely fast, and very high. The F6F has an operating ceiling of 37,000 feet, but on this day they exceed that considerably and still can't get close enough. . \"What the hell is that?\" one pilot yells over the radio. \"Nothing I've ever seen before,\" answers another. Rolan calls the base to report the situa- tion. They tell him to go higher. \"If we go much higher we can ruin these engines.\" \"Blow the engines if you have to, but use full military power, full throttle injection, maximum, continuous. Go for it!\" Rolan wonders what the pilots will do when the engines quit and the tower opera- tor tells them to \"glide back towards the air- port and hope that you make it.\" Even with the emergency settings, the F6F can't get close enough to determine the exact nature of this object. It doesn't make any overt moves, gives no signals, just hov- ers there as if observing, staying well enough out of reach. The pilots can't believe its ability to hover like this. When some of the engines begin to fail, and fuel consumption gets critical, the planes return to base one by one, and the strange craft disappears as quickly as it came. It doesn't return. Although a number of people witness this incident, the local newspaper carries no report of it in the days that follow. Rolan can only surmise that the government stepped in and clamped a lid on the whole affair, according to war security measures. After this episode, the pilots return to their normal routine of getting ready for combat. To obtain more details on this pre- Kenneth Arnold sighting and how such events were treated during World War II, Walt Andrus interviewed Rolan Powell, who now resides in Round Rock, Texas, with his lovely wife Donna. The six F6F \"Hellcats\" made visual con- tact with the object described by Rolan as the size of three aircraft carriers side by side, oval shaped, very streamlined like a stretched-out egg and pinkish in color. Rolan reported that some kind of vapor was being emitted around the outside edges from portholes or vents. He speculated that the vapor was being discharged to form a cloud for disguise. The object was observed at noon in a clear sky at an estimated alti- tude of 65,000 feet. Rolan and his fellow pilots pushed their F6Fs to 42,000 feet, which was well above the aircraft's rated ceiling of 37,000, but they were unsuccessful in making contact with this large unknown craft above them. After hovering in a fixed position above the Hanford Nuclear Reactor for an additional twenty minutes, the object disappeared going straight-up as the six Hellcats limped back to the Pasco Naval Air Station (Washington). Mr. Powell does not know where the other five pilots now live or their full names. The squadron consisted of 12 veteran fighter pilots, survivors from a for- mer squadron of 45 called Air Group III aboard the second U.S.S. Yorktown, fondly known as \"The Fighting Lady.\" When quizzed about the exact date of the sighting, Rolan didn't have his flight log available as a reference, but estimated that it was six weeks before the Japanese surren- der aboard the Battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945. This would place the sighting during the middle of July 1945. Library research disclosed that the Hanford Engineering Works Plant (Richland, Washington) was actually a large plutonium-production facility constructed adjacent to the Columbia River, using the water to cool the reactor piles. Opening for operation in September 1944, the Hanford site was a Fast Flux Test Facility (FFTF) to provide material for producing atomic bombs. This ultimately led to the dropping of bombs over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki, on August 9. Hostilities ceased on August 14, 1945. It is conceivable that unidentified flying objects may have had an interest in our nuclear energy program in 1945. Now, Rolan and his fellow Navy fighter pilots know what they were guarding at Hanford, which at that time was part of the ultra- secret Manhattan Project."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL THE ARGENTINA ENCOUNTER by Bruno Molon, Richard Elkin and Jimmy Blondet • jl has been said that a good place to be- • ^Tgin the search for the truth regarding H fcthe UFO enigma is to re-examine previously documented investigation cases. Unquestionably, some of the most startling cases in the history of ufology are the clas- sic CE3s, and even more notably, CE3s in- volving encounters with crashed or landed UFOs and their occupants. While it may be that with many of these \"classics\" much time and research has already been devoted (Roswell, undoubtedly, being the most glar- ing example of this), other significant cases have been left to languish in near obscurity. Though not widely publicized or docu- mented, on May 10, 1950, an extraordinary discovery was made by an individual dri- ving through a remote region of Argentina who happened across a landed disc and its three deceased, alien occupants. The witness in this case, aeronautical en- gineer Dr. Enrico Botha, 45, wrote an ac- count of his experience and sent his manu- script to three different sources: APRO (Aerial Phenomenon Research Organiza- tion), a Swiss UFO magazine, and noted ufologist Mr. Leonard Stringfield. Stringfield was sufficiently impressed with the particulars of this case that he wrote about it in his book Situation Red: The UFO Siege. He was absolutely convinced of the veracity of Dr. Botha's testimonial and of the value of this case to the field of ufology. What follows are the details of Botha's account: While driving through the remote stretches of the Pampas region in Bahia Blanca Province of eastern Argentina, Dr. Botha saw a metallic-looking disc resting on the ground off to the left of the road. He stopped the car to observe the disc for a few moments, the only discernible activity visi- ble being a flashing light on the top of the craft's tower. No type of landing gear was reported vis- ible on the craft, which was in an inclined position atop the ground; possibly indicative of a failed, or emergency, landing. Botha described the craft as being 32 feet in diameter, with a tower section (with win- dows) at the top of the craft measuring 6 feet in height and an interior height of seven feet. He described the outer surface of the disc as appearing \"slippery\" and \"brilliant,\" and though the hull appeared to be of a metallic composition it also exhibited a cu- rious, rubber-like resiliency. Not witnessing any indication of life aboard the fallen craft, Botha approached and peered inside the object through a tiny, open hatch on the side of the ship. He no- ticed a small orange-white light pulsating at one-second intervals within the ceiling of the tower, but the craft still appeared to be empty. With this assumption, Botha crawled inside the disc through the open hatch. O nce inside, Botha noticed two curious odors: ozone and garlic. As he began looking around the inside of the craft's inte- rior, he realized it was not, in fact, deserted. Inside the circular enclosure of the ob- ject's tower section were seated three small men, whom Botha described as having very human-like features: About four feet tall with bright eyes, short grey-chestnut col- ored hair and dark, bronze skin. All three occupants were clothed in tight-fitting grey overalls which exposed only the mens' faces and hands. Their feet were covered with boots of some sort. All three of the oc- cupants were dead, their bodies rigid. One of the occupants was seated in the center of the tower with a large panel of bright instruments in front of him. On top of the panel was a rotating sphere of glass or other form of transparent material. In all likelihood, this occupant was probably the craft's pilot, as his hands were resting upon two levers. Also to the right of the pilot was an apparatus resembling a TV screen. The other two occupants were reclining on soft, curved couches positioned along the circular wall of the tower. A third couch re- mained empty. There were no cables, pipes or other sim- ilar structures witnessed within the tower, but the cabin floor was lined with holes, or vents.

However, darkness was falling, so it was de- cided that they would wait until morning. At daybreak they set out to find the space- craft.

Dr. Botha photographed the disc that was closest to him. He took five pictures in all, but only two showed the object clearly. A few sec- onds later, the two discs went towards the larger object and, apparently, coalesced with it. The cigar-shaped craft then turned blood- red and disappeared quickly from sight. Weeks later, Dr. Botha experienced skin irritations, fever and blisters. No conclusive diagnosis was reached for his condition since the green substance was washed off by the gasoline, essentially an antiseptic. While inside the craft, Botha wore green- tinted glasses. The areas where the glasses covered his eyes and where his clothing covered his skin were left unaffected. EPILOGUE For years, Dr. Botha told no one of his bizarre experience except his immediate cir- cle of friends. Finally, in the late Fall of 1954, while living in Caracas, Venezuela, he confided in Mr. Horatio Gonzales. Mr. Gonzales was APRO's Venezuelan repre- sentative and foremost UFO researcher. Mr. Gonzales revealed the story to a Caracas newspaper — El Universal — which pub- lished it in January, 1955. Mr. Gonzales no- tified APRO officials in the United States (the Lorenzens) as well as Cincinnati re- searcher Leonard H. Stringfield. Stringfield was so intrigued, he requested correspon- dence with the witness. Dr. Botha sent Stringfield a letter in April, 1955 describing the experience, and also sent the pho- tographs. In 1993 I (Molon) discussed this case with Len Stringfield at his home in Cincinnati. He assured me the case was real — he had seen the photographs and still had them in his possession, but did not know where they were. Stringfield was the last person left alive with any knowledge of the case. Now he is also dead."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL This case is not a figment of someone's imagination, or a phantom of the literature. Dr. Botha's observations are very important and provide some information concerning the inside of the UFOs. It is pointless to speculate on what killed with an interesting anecdote and little else. Some of the features stated in the report are corroborated by other later observations in other cases, such as hull resiliency and basic configuration.

Peterson Avenue Chicago, IL 60659 (312)271-3611 December 1996 Number 344 Page 18 258 pages of finely-packed print, Volume 6 (New Series) of the Journal of UFO Studies is half again as thick as the last issue, which appeared in 1994. And the difference isn't mere padding. Here are thick, meaty articles on the abduction experience, anomalous images captured on videotape by Space Shuttle Flight STS-48. the Condon Report, Donald Keyhoe's long and influential career, and the declining coverage of UFOs by The New York Times from 1947 to 1995. Did I mention the letters section and a healthy dollop of book reviews? In the opening article, \"Psychotherapy for the UFO Abduction Experience,\" David Gotlib of Johns Hopkins Hospital examines both the extreme skeptical and belief approach to the abduction phenomenon and finds them both wanting, substituting instead what he refers to as an agnostic approach. Although speaking as a therapist and not a UFO investigator, Gotlib's remarks as to when hypnosis might be called for are worth quoting at length. In my own practice, he says, \"I consider using hypnosis only when three requirements are met: \"1. The client has failed to come to terms with the experience through other measures. \"2. The client understands the risks and fundamental limitations of the technique that hypnotically refreshed memory is sub- ject to suggestibility, confabulation, and memory hardening (producing confidence in both true and false memories); that it is not possible to differentiate a correct from an incorrect recollection on the basis of vividness, emotional strength, or any other factor: and that while hypnosis may help the client to accommodate and adjust to the experience, it will not provide proof of the objective reality of the experience. \"3. The client understands that the thera- peutic intervention is experimental.\" Psychologist Stuart Appelle, who recent- ly succeeded Michael Swords as JUFOS editor, contributes a detailed summary of the subject with \"The Abduction Experience: A Critical Evaluation of Theory and Evidence.\" The author has literally combed the abduction literature both popu- lar and scientific with a fine-lined fork to come up with what is probably the most concise overview of the topic any objective reader could hope for. If you want to know what skeptics, believers and science have all said about abductions at one time or anoth- er, you won't find a better starting or ending point. To quote a cliche: worth the cost of admission alone. For hard science and equation lovers, there's Jack Kasher's \"Anomalous Images on Videotape from Space Shuttle Flight STS-48: Examination of the Ice-Particle Explanation.\" This is a reworked and expanded version of an article that was first published in the 1994 MUFON annual symposium Proceedings and later by the Fund for UFO Research. I won't be spoil- ing too much of the suspense if I say that Kasher throws hot water on the ice particle theory. Previous editor Michael Swords con- tributes two lengthy historical essays: \"The University of Colorado UFO Project: 'The Scientific Study of UFOs'\" and \"Donald E. Keyhoe and the Pentagon: The Rise of Interest in the UFO Phenomenon and What the Government Really Knew.\" The first of these is accompanied by Willy Smith's \"A Reference Guide for the Condon Report,\" which offers an analysis and identification of the individual cases studied by the Colorado Project. The concluding article is \"Fewer Sightings in the National Press: A Content Analysis of UFO News Coverage in The New York Times, 1947-1995\" by John Hickman, Dale McConkey II, and Matthew Barrett. Books reviewed (reviewers' names are in parentheses) are Alien Discussions and Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind (by Thomas Bullard), Encounter at Buff Ledge (by Richard Haines), The Gods Have Landed (by Charles Emmons), and Watch the Skies! (by Mark Rodeghier). Published by the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, JUFOS, to the best of my knowledge, remains the world's only sci- entifically refereed UFO journal, which means that articles are submitted for peer review prior to publication. Highly recom- mended for your own elucidation, and as a means of contributing to further scientific research into the UFO phenomenon. CUFOS's Web page can be found at http://www.cufos.org/."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL you'll know, let me say up front that as co-editor and publisher of The Anomalist, with Patrick Huyghe, I har- bor a certain unabashed prejudice: not sur- prisingly, I think rather highly of it. We come out two times a year in a quality paperback format and try to pack as many individual gems into each issue as we can, either in the form of a new treatment of an old subject, or a subject that you aren't like- ly to see tackled anywhere else in the first place. We cover the entire gamut of so-called fortean phenomena, which of course includes UFOs. This issue we actually have a coup of sorts, \"Project Blue Book's Last Years,\" an excerpt from the unpub- lished memoirs of Colonel Hector Quintanilla, who directed Blue Book from 1963 until it's closing in 1969. Two cases are covered in some detail — Socorro, New Mexico, and the 1966 Michigan \"swamp gas\" incident. A less than flatter- ing picture of the late J. Allen Hynek emerges, which is hardly surprising given that Quintanilla is writing from the Air Force point of view. What surfaces most clearly, though, is the age-old conflict of cultures between the military and civilian mindset. In this case it just happened to be over UFOs. \"The Earth's Second Moon,\" by Paul Schlyter, looks at the question of whether or not we have a second natural satellite in orbit about our planet, a notion that dates back to at least the mid-1840s. \"Keen on Crop Circles,\" by England's Montague Keen, former scientific adviser to the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, sur- veys recent developments in the wheat fields of southern England. Accompanied by many photographs supplied by Rob Irving. Steve Mizrach's \"Wired Spirits\" is hard to categorize, which is why we liked it. Basically, it asks the question: Is cyber- space inhabited by disembodied voices and spirits who try to contact us via computers and other electronic equipment? In \"Dangerous Vision: The Phantom of Broad Mountain, Pennsylvania,\" Gary Mangiacopra examines the grisly, unsolved 1925 murder of a young girl and the local legends that grew up in its wake. Well known cryptozoologist Loren Coleman looks at the famous picture of a purportedly unknown South American \"ape\" taken by explorer Francois de Loys in 1920, and concludes that it is probably of a spider monkey. How did it get mystified? Can you spell racism? \"Screams from the Stream\" is by Michael Cremo, co-author of the contro- versial Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race, and shows how unkindly orthodox science takes to outsiders and non-mainstream ideas. Sound familiar? \"An Egyptian State of Mind\" is an excerpt from Colin Wilson's newest book, From Atlantis to the Sphinx, as yet unpub- lished in this country. If you think sex played a major role in human evolution, so, too, did magic and religion. Finally, there are comments on \"The Mysterious Phenomenon of Loading\" by Betty Eisner and Dr. Larry Dossey. Loading is what happens when a second party, not necessarily in physical contact with the first, takes on and carries the latter's physi- cal or psychical symptoms. Opening commentary, \"Nine Reasons to Fear the Paranormal.\" is provided by Michael Grosso. author of Millennium Myth. Our Web page is at http://www.cloud9.net/~patrick/anomalist.

Put another way, the repetition of specific sequence and detail in abductee's accounts supposedly.augurs for the reality of the experience. From MUFON's own Abduction Transcription Project, however, we know that a consider- able variety of abductors and assistants have been reported over the years, from traditional \"greys\" and \"Nords,\" to entities resembling insects, reptiles and other bio- logical \"hybrids\" or crossbreeds, not to speak of the occasional unique entity. Throw in the whole of the UFO literature, with its space-suited dwarfs, hairy giants and trolls, metallic robots, and the occa- sional absolutely human humanoid, and where does that leave the issue of consis- tency as an affirmative argument? Somewhat adrift in space, I would sup- pose. These and other thoughts ran through my mind as I read Patrick Huyghe's The Field Guide'to Extraterrestrials: A com- plete overview of alien life/arms based on actual accounts and sightings, illustrated by Harry Trumbore. Some 50 \"classic\" cases are covered (and individually illus- trated) here, hardly any two of which are exactly alike, even though said entities have been divided into only four major cat- egories: Humanoid, Animalian, Robotic and Exotic. The understated implications here are enormous. Either the previously presumed predominant greys are capable of appear- ing in any form at will or they aren't. But if they can shape-shift at whim, then why assume that their grey appearance is any more legitimate or authentic than any of their other options? At the same time, per- haps disparity of appearance argues for a psychological interpretation of UFO close encounters? (What's more individual than brain-embedded human consciousness?) It's one thing, after all, to argue that we're being visited by a specific species of alien, as opposed to being repeatedly invaded by every Tom, Dick and Harry in the galactic neighborhood. Star Trek aside, space travel among so many different extraterrestrial civilizations can't be that easy, can it?

Much in the news lately, our famous planetary neighbor rises in the E before 11 PM on the 1st and an hour and a half earlier by month's end. It advances across the southern sky during the night. Jupiter (magnitude -1.9), in Sagittarius, is visible only dur- ing the first few days of January, very low in the WSW at dusk. Saturn (1.0), in Pisces, stands in the SSW at dusk and sets later about 10 PM in mid-January. The lunar crescent ap- pears near the planet on the 13th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) rises in the ESE about 6 AM in midmonth but stays very low in the twilight sky, finally vanishing into the solar glare by month's end. A thin crescent Moon hovers above the bright world on January 7. After the first week of the month, the planet Mercury appears near Venus, moving 3° above it on the 12th. Use binoculars. Mars moves to a point high in the SW at dawn. Comet Hale-Bopp: Discovered in July 1995 by amateur astronomers Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp, Comet Hale-Bopp should surpass last year's Hyakutake by a wide margin when it achieves maxi- mum brightness in March and April. Unlike the latter ob- ject, Hale-Bopp is a giant with an icy nucleus estimated anywhere from about 10 to 25 miles across (compared with Hyakutake's l-to-2-mile nucleus). Also the newcomer has been spewing lots of dust, promising a much brighter tail. In January find an unobstructed eastern horizon and look al- most due E between about 5:45 and 6 AM. Moving NE through the constellation Aquila. the comet rises tailfirst, appearing low in the sky but increasing its altitude during the month from about 4° to 20° above the horizon at latitude 40° N. (Moonlight hampers observations late in the month.) If the fuzzy object follows the latest revised predictions (as this is being written), it should attain 3rd magnitude in January and stand out to the naked eye if the sky is dark enough. Binoculars will help. While comets are notoriously fickle—last fall Hale-Bopp was running about a magnitude behind original predic- tions—this one still has the potential to put on a memorable show in the spring. Moon Phases: Last quarter—January 1 New moon—January 8 The Stars: At 9 PM this month the observer with binoculars is re- warded with a number of special objects in the heavens. Moving from E to W, first focus on a faint smudge between Leo and Gemini—the wedgeshaped star cluster called the Beehive. Next, go to the showpiece of the winter sky, Orion, and note that the hazy star in the Hunter's sword turns out to be the famous Orion Nebula, a glowing gas and dust cloud where new stars are born. In Taurus examine the beautiful star field of the Bull's face, the V-shaped Hyades cluster. And nearby don't forget the outstanding Pleiades cluster. Finally, sweep to Andromeda's twin row of stars and find an elongated patch of light, the Andromeda Galaxy, another star system similar to our own Milky Way. The spiral system in Andromeda glows from a distance of 2 million light years.

Obviously, the motto or theme of the TV program \"X- files\" cannot be accepted. The revelation of MU- FON's motto and the winning entry will be announced in the Journal as soon as possible. It is imperative that adequate consideration is devoted to the selection of the motto, since it must be appropriate for the twenty- first century. CHRISTMAS GIFT SUBSCRIPTION TO THE JOURNAL If you have enjoyed reading the MUFON UFO Journal, here is your opportunity to share that plea- sure with a friend, or relative that has an interest in the UFO phenomenon. A gift subscription form is in- cluded in this issue of the Journal for your conve- nience. This is an appropriate gift, not only at Christmas, but anytime during the year such as a birthday remembrance. Your gift subscription may start with the month of your choice by so indicating on the form. Interest in the UFO phenomenon has taken some giant steps in the media, TV, and the mo- tion picture industry, during the past year with many new innovations promised for 1997. We could double the number of member/readers if each present member gave one gift subscription. CROP CIRCLES REPORT In the summer of 1992, Project Argus investigated one of the most remarkable mysteries of the century, the sudden and baffling appearance of hundreds of huge, magnificent shapes—dubbed \"crop circles\"—in the fields of England each summer. Made of grain flat- tened methodically to the ground in intricate patterns, they were a form of landscape art which quickly at- tracted worldwide attention. But the \"artist\" was un- known. Where did they come from? What agent or force routinely generated them overnight? Could they be products of something other than human activity? It seems appropriate to seek to answer such questions with the instruments and methods of science. Everyone interested in the study of the crop phe- nomenon should have a copy of the Report on the Results of Project Argus: An Instrumented Study of the Physical Materials of Crop Circles, edited by Michael Chorost, in 1993. Since MUFON provided $2,500 to financially support this ambitious team project, we have a supply of the 115-page books for sale. A copy may be purchased for $15, plus $2.00 for postage and handling in U.S. funds, from MUFON in Seguin, TX.
