Carpenter, MSW,LCSW This interesting case involving four surveillance cameras at a factory in Florida, presented in detail in the May 1999 issue of \\heMUFON UFO Journal, has withstood additional detailed investigation by Jeff Sainio, MUFON photoanalyst. These 24-hour video cameras appeared to have captured a worker disappearing in a circular beam of light at 11:16 p.m. and returning in a unique, laser-like, \"puddle of light\" at 1:06 a.m. The electrical systems of all four cameras, as well as the lights in the factory, reacted strangely to some kind of energy-possibly a strong magnetic wave. The security guard had been unable to locate the worker during that period of \"missing time.\" The worker vomited immediately following his reappearance, was disoriented and unable to account for his whereabouts, and went home ill in the middle of his shift. He called in sick the next three days and then quit his job, never to be interviewed or heard from again. Circumstantial details suggested a possible UFO abduction event. Initial review by independent analysts supported that the video footage was a genuine piece of security film that had not been faked or tampered with in any detectable manner. This update shall present significant new findings from a scientific analysis performed by Sainio, MUFON's video expert. Sainio, a well-recognized authority and Beam origin \\ I I*/ Van ish i nip-ipoi njt determ i nation of light pp£it,iqh / / ;,,/ Camera angle of \"straight down\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 October 2000 MUFON UFO Journal technical critic in video analysis, has exposed many faked photographs and hoaxed videotapes while researching UFO cases worldwide for the Mutual UFO Network. He takes a very precise and scientific approach, utilizing some of the best equipment available for video analysis. His conclusions are based on sound principles, hard data, and scientific methodology-not opinion or impressions. His overall conclusion suggests authenticity. \"I agree this case is high strangeness,\" says Sainio. \"The lighting appears very difficult to fake, and the electronic oddities almost impossible. I've been an FCC-licensed broadcast engineer since I was 18, and I've never seen anything like this. This video is absolutely self-consistent-no evidence of fakery. I conclude that the video is genuine as the most reasonable conclusion. The result of this conclusion is ... obvious and astounding.\" Jeff examined a number of important areas: (l)the visual effects from the camera's Automatic Gain Control due to the anomalous lights, (2) re-measuring the location of the lights through trigonometry, (3) causes for the types of camera malfunctioning and video disruptions, (4) relative intensity of the anomalous lights, (5) the speed of the \"on-off 'times for the various lights observed with comparisons to other known light sources, and (6) probable size of source lights from sharpness of shadows. All video cameras have Auto Gain Control (AGC) to accommodate changes in brightness. For example, a night scene is easily a million times darker than a sunny scene. If the output video is all dark, the AGC adjusts the brightness by adjusting the controls until the output shows brightness somewhere in the signal. Likewise, the AGC will adjust down the brightness if it is too bright anywhere in the picture. AGC is totally internal to each camera and would not interact with or affect any other camera in a security system. Jeff believes that the \"spreading outward\" effect of the two \"light puddles\" with the worker's return at 1:06 a.m. is due to the AGC effect as the camera adjusts to the bright beam of light. He also believes that there is probably just one beam of light occurring at that time instead of two separate \"light puddles.\" This is determined by Jeff's finding of an unexplained signal loss or spike to the camera between the two attempts by the camera's AGC (which appear as \"spreading outward\") to adjust to the anomalous light source. This would also explain why the \"light puddles\" are in the precise same location just outside the gate. He adds that the image will still \"burn-in regardless of signal disruption,\" and a negative image is observed, proving that a light source did exist in the scene and Overlapping frames to show how metal sign on gate actually blocks view of worker's shadow. \"Double exposure\" overlapping technique showing both the initial light beam and returning \"puddle.\" was not a construction by a prankster. Sainio does not believe that the lights are off in the factory in the upper right quadrant view. The camera runs off the same power source as the lights. Instead, the AGC has darkened the scene considerably to adjust for the brighter \"light puddle.\" This is also evident in the \"lights coming right back on\" after the \"light puddle\" turns off-another AGC effect as it readjusts to the original indoor lighting. But why, then, do all four camera screens show darkened factory rooms, since the AGC works independently in all four cameras? Sainio examined the disruptions on all four video screens to learn what exactly had occurred with each camera. By breaking down each NTSC video frame into two fields (each = l/60th of a second) and examining the horizontal-sync signal, vertical-sync signal, and sync losses occurring, Sainio could attempt to diagnose the problems. If not synchronized, a horizontal-sync signal is recognized"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 2000 PageS as a diagonal line across the screen or as a bunch of dashes scattered about the screen. A non-synchronized vertical signal appears as a horizontal \"Morse Code\" bar. Sync loss is caused by either a \"not-yet-stabilized\" camera or the receiver has not adjusted to align the picture yet. Signal loss is caused by either a loss of power or interference blocking the signal coming through the cable. Virtually all video cables are extremely resistant to outside interference with the exception of lightning strikes or frying the cable inside of a microwave oven! Sainio set out to determine whether these disruptions were the result of a power loss or signal interference. He was able to determine that all four cameras had lost power with the first beam of light at 11:16 p.m. and recovered at various rates, which is quite normal. Assuming that these are common, non-CCD cameras which use a flying-spot scanning tube and can give a negative image (which did occur with the 1:06 a.m. light), the electron beam can be disrupted by a simple but strong magnetic field. Pilots report their magnetic compasses \"going wacky\" with the onset of a UFO sighting. Sometimes they experience a burned-out motor or generator due to magnetic saturation from a UFO encounter. Therefore, a strong magnetic field serves as the best explanation at this point in time. However, with the \"puddle of light\" occurring at 1:06 a.m. Sainio concludes that the lower right quadrant camera lost power twice, the lower left quadrant camera lost power once, the upper left camera view lost power once, but the closest camera view of the back gate in the upper right screen never lost power at all. Instead, this camera had its signal disrupted four times. Since this camera is \"closest to the action,\" Sainio considers this to be quite odd. Because this camera never lost its proper horizontal-sync frequency, the signal must have been blocked by some \"unknown mechanism.\" He adds, \"The technology to accomplish this is beyond plausible Earth ability.\" Focusing on light intensities, Sainio was able to estimate that the \"light puddle\" is actually about ten times brighter than the first \"abducting\" light beam. Because the AGC in the upper right camera does not darken the scene at 11:16 p.m., this suggests that the light beam outside is not significantly different or brighter than the illumination of the metal sign by inside factory lights. Sainio guesses that this light beam's intensity is equivalent to a typical, 400- watt, street light type of ambient illumination. In sharp contrast Sainio estimates that the intensity of the \"light puddle\" at 1:06 a.m. is about ten times greater because the AGC in that camera darkens the scene significantly to accommodate for the intensity of the illumination.

Sainio re-checked Dan Ahrens' initial measurements and confirmed those basic results. However, he utilized some additional trigonometry to create more exact and accurate measurements. He determined that the upper right quadrant camera is 19 feet off the ground under the eaves of a two-story building and angled at 45 degrees. The gate is 23% closer than the worker, putting him about seven feet beyond the gate. The shadow of the gate's horizontal bar is 3.5 feet from the gate, indicating a beam angle of 41 degrees above horizontal. The beam source is about 14 feet above the ground and 20 feet to the left of the worker's head. With both the \"abducting beam\" and the \"light puddle,\" sharp shadows are cast by the gate's centerpole, indicating a point source of of light very small, angular size-less than 20 inches in diameter. The significance of these measurements is that the light source is clearly hovering in the air near the worker. Jeff looked closely at the speed at which these unusual lights appeared and vanished in comparison with the \"on-off times of known light sources. The \"abducting beam\" at 11:16 p.m. came on in at least l/60th of a second (one-or less than one-field of video). A conventional light bulb requires l/12th of a second (five fields of video). This eliminates common spotlights, car headlights, and halogen lights as possible sources. Worker crouched toward the left under dark sign in \"puddle of light\" at 1:06 a.m. return. This first light beam's turn-off time cannot be calculated, due to the camera's malfunctioning. Similarly, due to the AGC's effort to adjust to the \"light puddle\" at 1:06 a.m., its turn-on time cannot be exactly determined either. However, its turn-off time could be calculated precisely at a remarkable l/1800th of a second. No spotlight or tungsten light can do this! Sainio also notes that this \"light puddle\" is a \"well-collimated\" light beam shining on the ground from above which does not illuminate surroundings. Almost nothing (known to us) other than a laser beam would be well-collimated enough to do this. The same effect can be demonstrated with a laser pointer aimed downward at a flat surface. Sainio concludes that no tungsten bulbs, halogen lights, or gas sources such as sodium-vapor, mercury, or metal-halide could account for these light sources. Other sources of light such as lightning, a police helicopter searchlight, and a strobe light were considered. (1) Although the turn-on time for lightning is similar enough, the electromagnetic field from the bolt would reach the camera at the speed of light-not after four fields of video. The linear nature of lightning eliminates it as a possible explanation. Shadows from the worker and the gate's horizontal bar are sharp which indicate the light source has little height. Therefore, the light source is point-like with some scattered light, and concentrates on the worker-all contrary to the nature of lightning. Lightning could not even begin to explain the aspects of the \"light puddle.\" (2) A police searchlight has terrible beam concentration and could not account for the obvious lack of light"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 2000 Page? scattering with the \"light puddle.\" Although the nature of the illumination appears more similar to the \"abducting beam,\" a police searchlight's turn-on time would be simply too slow. (3) A strobe light does turn on in a microsecond and has a small point source, but remains the same intensity and flashes. The initial abducting beam shows a growing increase in intensity and no flashing effect at all. The later \"light puddle\" also has no flashing effect and is too focused. It also appears to change in intensity. In conclusion, this new scientific analysis not only continues to strongly reject the idea of a hoax, but it also clearly suggests that a technology and unusual types of light sources unfamiliar to man are involved. The presence of a UFO and a strong magnetic field seem much more plausible now. We still can only assume that this worker may have been abducted, but the evidence continues to accumulate toward supporting that assumption. Deorbiting of Iridium satellites a mixed blessing for astronomers By Paul Parsons Astronomy Now Motorola intends to deorbit all 66 of the satellites owned by its bankrupt offshoot Iridium LLC, after attempts to find a buyer for the satellite phone company failed. Astronomically, the news is a mixed blessing. It will certainly be well received by radio observers, who have protested that the transmission frequency of the satellites interferes with the 1612 MHz band, used to study the distribution of OH, the hydroxyl radical. OH is one of the most common interstellar molecules, and enables radio astronomers to investigate the evaporation of comets and the birth and death of stars. Satellite watchers, however, will be less pleased. The imminent demise of Iridium means an end to the bright spectacle of \"Iridium flares.\" Each satellite has two silver- coated Teflon antennae, angled with respect to its body. The antennae act like giant mirrors, reflecting the Sun's rays down to the ground. An observer in the right place at the right time can see this reflection as the satellite passes over as a flash, lasting only a few seconds, but brighter than Venus. Work has already begun on deorbiting the satellites. So if you've never seen an Iridium flare before, now is the time to start looking. To find out when the next flare will occur, see http://www.heavens-above.com/. The last Iridium satellite should drop from orbit in 2002... 4 Nova Scotia paperboy incident' detailed By Eugene H. Prison MUFON Nova Scotia Provincial Director Many thanks to Richard Hall for pointing out in the July 2000 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal that the \"Nova Scotia paperboy incident\" was not known by many and detail was scarce. This incident was investigated by myself in February of this year, and a full report was prepared at that time. The report had not been submitted to MUFON because I was holding back until I could arrange a polygraph examination of the witness, who has consented to undergo this type of testing. Because of certain facts in this case, I feel strongly a polygraph is in order, and the results of one should be part of the record. Brief notifications of the event were sent to George Filer, MUFON's Eastern Region director, as well as to numerous other interested individuals, such as MUFON's Assistant Provincial Director for Nova Scotia, Christopher Styles. The event later attracted much interest and attention, so I have decided to submit the report immediately, as well as this article, to allow full details to be received by any who have heard of this case and may be wondering about certain of its aspects. I still plan the polygraph examination for this witness as soon as this can be arranged. The reason for this will be apparent as one becomes familiar with the circumstances. The incident occurred on the morning of Jan. 24,2000, and it was reported to me on Jan. 28 by a brother of the witness. I immediately began to arrange an interview with the witness, but it took another week (and a lot of convincing by the witness' brother) to succeed in pinning him down to a face to face conversation. The original details I received were passed on to me by the witness' brother, and a few of these changed as I talked to the witness personally. The brother had related certain details to me that were his impressions, but once I began asking in-depth questions, it became clear the actual details were slightly different from a few of the impressions formed by the brother. These questions were put to the witness during my first interview with him on Feb.. 5,2000. It was after first talking to the witness 1 brother that I sent a brief indication of the event having occurred to George Filer, which also stated the sighting was under investigation and that details would be updated completely once the investigation was wrapped up."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS October 2000 MUFON UFO Journal to exit In early May, I sent an update to George Filer and this was published in the Filer's Files #19-2000 (May 15, 2000) issue (on-line). This contained new details, as well as certain revised details (such as the object's true size) taken from the final report of the completed investigation that I prepared for MUFON's Deputy Director of Investigations. I decided to hold this report back pending the results of a polygraph examination that I have been trying to arrange so the Deputy Director of Investigations would have one complete report instead of causing him extra effort with additions to the report arriving later on. The update that appeared on-line (Filer's Files) seemed to generate immense interest in the event. I received e-mail from all over and from as far away as Russia. It was a version of this update that appeared in \\h&MUFON UFO Journal (June 2000 issue). Jeff, 16, a paperboy in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, awoke at 5:40 a.m., being roused from sleep by the alarm on his wristwatch. He did a few things around the house before leaving his residence promptly at 6 a.m. to do his paper route. He arrived at the entrance to the Greenwood cemetery off Dominion Street about ten minutes later and decided to take a shortcut through it because a customer was fussy about having his paper very early. As he was entering the cemetery, he felt something was not right, but couldn't put his finger on it. The wind seemed different in that it had a \"whine\" riding it. He had walked about a hundred feet into the cemetery when, out of the comer of his eye, he noticed a dark shape moving to catch up with him from behind. At first, he thought it was a tall person running to intercept him, but was so startled and had so little time before it caught up with him that he didn't realize how silly this impression really was. It was, by now, approximately 6:15 a.m. NOT TO SCALE grown in road UFO >// location of witness (UFO was first noticed here) y ROUGH DIAGRAM BY INVESTIGATOR TO CLARIFY UFO'S MOVEMENTS (IT IS APPROX. 200 FEET FROM WHERE FIRST NOTICED TO WHERE IT VEERS OFF ROAD) v, UFO grass entrance The object passed him on his right side at a distance of about three to four feet maximum, and was moving very fast. He felt a rush of cold air strike his right cheek as it passed and noticed a steady high-pitched, low-volume sound being emitted from it. His scalp seemed to become hot as it went by. Once it had moved out in front of him, he was able to discern its triangle shape. It was a solid object; he felt he could reach out and rap on its surface. It was sharply defined and was not hazy, nebulous, shadowy nor cloudy in nature. It was completely black and had no lights or light source anywhere on its surface nor could any be detected from within. There were no structures or markings of any kind visible. It was about nine feet in height and approximately five feet along its base. It was not flying aerodynamically, that is to say, it moved through the air with its tallest point upwards instead of this point leading. The \"ends\" of the triangle were rounded and about one and one-half feet at"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 20UO Page 9 their narrowest (they did not come to a sharp point). The object, for the most part, followed the contour of the cemetery road, but remained at all times above the grass along the road. It only deviated its flight path from the contour of the road at the end of the sighting when it turned into the darkness. The speed of the anomaly was constant at all times; it did not slow down nor speed up at any time during the entire sighting. The witness felt it was just hugging the ground as it was moving, but never actually touched it. The cemetery road makes a near ninety-degree change of direction, forming an extremely sharp turn at about the cemetery's midpoint. The object negotiated this turn at high speed and without altering its velocity (it was now out in front of the witness as it was doing so). It continued on for perhaps another one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet before veering off on a sharp forty-five-degree angle away from the road. This second change in direction caused its path to now go through the tombstones located in the field adjacent the road. However, it did not weave in and out among the tombstones; it followed a straight path to the northeast. The witness wasn't sure of the direction it had come from, only noticing it when it had approached fairly close to him. It is important to point out that, although it was still dark at this time of the morning in the winter, after the anomaly had moved out in front of the witness it was silhouetted against a street light (sodium) that was located in the cemetery for most of its course. Only after it veered off into the field did it blend into the darkness and become lost to sight in the distance. The object veered off on the forty-five degree angle turn immediately after it passed two trees with a tombstone situated between them. An old road, now grown in and barely noticeable, was discovered by this investigator beside this particular arrangement of trees and tombstone. It provides a clear avenue straight to the cemetery's end, and it is possible the UFO moved down this clearing. The witness feels it did not, but since it did not weave in and out, it is not apparent how it could avoid striking a tombstone unless it was somehow able to calculate quickly in advance an available straight course through the numerous tombstones despite its quick speed. Jeff does not feel it was high enough off the ground to clear the tombstones. It is also possible the object gained some slight altitude after it left the roadside which was not perceived by the witness because it was now entering an area more poorly illuminated. However, the poorer light in this part of the cemetery may also have caused the witness to not perceive the object's detour down the old road. Since everything happened so quickly, the witness could be mistaken as to the actual path through the darkness taken by the UFO. Just a tiny difference in the angle of turn as estimated by the witness would take it down this old road. An alternative is that it was just extremely lucky in its maneuvers! In any event, this anomalous object was soon lost in the darkness of the cemetery after its second change of direction. The witness says the entire sighting was about five to ten seconds in duration, but he was quite sure about what he had seen. After its departure, he noticed he was very afraid and just wanted to get out of the cemetery. He had to complete the turn in the road at the cemetery's midpoint (he hadn't progressed very far along the road, although he had continued walking throughout the entire time the object was in sight) and walk a few hundred feet to the exit on Highland Street. While walking to the exit, he said he heard very strange scuffing sounds behind him, but did not have the courage to turn around and see what was causing them. It sounded like something moving across the short grass and following him. At 6:30 a;m., the witness was surprised to hear the alarm on his wristwatch sound again while he was still doing his paper route. He had not changed the settings of the alarm at any time since it woke him from his sleep and had merely shut it off at that time. It was an effort to change the alarm settings so he felt it could not have been reset by accident. As far as he knew, \" It should still be set for 5:40 a.m.!\" Within hours of the sighting, tiny red raised blisters formed on the witness' forehead, cheek and chest areas. At first he believed them to be acne, but knew they were not normal for acne. They were extremely sensitive and painful and hurt so much if touched or picked that it brought tears to his eyes. These remained for two days and then disappeared completely. It is unfortunate that I did not get to hear of the event until so long after it occurred that I was not able to view the blisters. The witness did not seek any attention, medical or otherwise, for the blisters which he relates resembled a rash. However, the blisters were witnessed by another of Jeff's brothers, and this brother told me he had seen them. The effect produced by picking or touching these blisters was an intense burning, stinging sensation. An additional fact is the witness says he was about forty-five minutes late completing his paper route that morning compared to other days. He says it could be it was because it was his first day doing the route, but adds the route is a very small one and he wonders if this could really account for such a difference in time completing it. Also, for about a week prior to the sighting, he had"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 October 2000 MUFON UFO Journal experienced nightmares of the roof of his house being ripped off and the wind coming to get him. These started suddenly and ended just as quickly. There were no more such nightmares after the incident in the cemetery. These factors may or may not be related, but since they were told to me by the witness, I feel I would be remiss in my reporting if I did not present them. During the investigation, I made two trips to the cemetery and took eight photographs of the area covering the entire route from entrance to exit. These also included close-ups of the two trees and tombstone where the object veered off the road and of the old grown-in road. One photograph shows the position of the sodium lamp within the cemetery. Measurements were taken along the cemetery road at various important points, but these could only be as estimated by the witness because he had only a rough idea of where he was when key details were taking place. I took some compass readings as well to try and plot more accurately the object's exact flight path, but because of the witness' uncertainty these also can only go so far in their usefulness. Two lengthy interviews were conducted with the witness, as well as numerous shorter phone calls and meetings, giving a total of about three hours discussing the event. I made calls to the DISID and also aviation authorities to try to determine the nature of the object, but the likelihood of gaining any information on a flying black triangle with the characteristics described above was doubted from the beginning. This skepticism proved to be justified. The final important fact will illustrate why I want a polygraph examination to be conducted. Jeffery is my son from a previous marriage. I have always been disturbed by the fact that my family has seen a number of UFOs over the years since 1970 and have also experienced various paranormal incidents, one of which involved an entity that communicated with the witness. I have personally observed three UFO events over these years, and these were discussed in the December 1999 and January 2000 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal. I don't like the idea of so many incidents involving one family and want to find an explanation for this. At this point, I prefer to think it is just because the witnesses are in the right place at the right time Glace Bay and its neighboring village, Reserve Mines, may be a location of interest to UFOs. As Richard Hall pointed out in his PERSPECTIVE (MUFON UFO Journal, February 2000), a pattern of interest by UFOs in mines and minerals has been noticed by several investigators around the world for forty or more years. The Reserve Mines and Glace Bay regions have been dotted with coal mines for almost their entire history. So Sketch of UFO drawn by witness have many of the towns surrounding them, such as Sydney Mines, Lingan, Dominion, etc. But perhaps the most relevant fact that may point to a reason why UFOs are interested in this area is that for many years, and up to only a short while ago, Glace Bay (Donkin) had a plant that produced heavy water for atomic purposes. It was one of two heavy water plants on the island that did so, the other being located in Port Hawkesbury. The plant is dismantled now, but the fenced- in location still exists. When my family had its first UFO experience (see MUFON UFO Journal, December 1999), the heavy water plant was still active, and its towers could be seen from my mother's picture window (of the house). This is the same window through which we watched the domed disk on that August night in 1970. So it may be that there are just a lot of UFOs gravitating to this region because there are items of interest here, and if you are out and about at the right time you get to see one. I am aware of some evidence that links UFOs with certain families over a number of generations. This, of course, could also be an explanation, but it disturbs me to consider this to be an option. And until there is a lot more evidence to justify such a conclusion, I think it more likely that simpler, more mundane explanations for our multiple experiences are the foundation of events such as have"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 2000 Page 11 occurred to Jeffery Prison and described in this text. Since he is my son and knows my deep interest in the subject of UFOs, and since he knows the family has seen numerous such anomalies, I feel a polygraph examination will help to establish the reality of his experience. I know him not to be interested in these types of things and to not be a person who would lie to his father or mislead me (or anyone else) regarding such things. But one can never know what is going on in the mind of another, and despite my personal convictions as to his character and reliability, I want to establish a better basis as to the reality of what he claims happened other than his word and my convictions. Although I spent a prolonged period \"preparing\" him before asking him whether or not he would undergo the polygraph exam, he consented without hesitation or obvious sign of concern. By the time I had asked him to take one, I had spent many seemingly unrelated hours building up the accuracy of the polygraph, and I am sure he formed a deep impression that such equipment was highly advanced today and extremely reliable. If he was being deceitful in any way, the preparation should have caused him great concern of being caught in a lie, and some distress or hesitation should have been evident. However, he appeared enthusiastic, even relieved, over taking the exam because it seemed he wanted to show people he wasn't crazy or hallucinating. This was his biggest concern since it happened—that people would think he was mentally unbalanced.

(See related story below.) Flying black triangles over Nova Scotia By George A. Filer, MUFON Eastern Director Filer's Files CAPE BRETON-Eugene H. Prison, MUFON Provincial Director, reports that another Flying Black Triangle was observed in the region by a new set of witnesses on Aug. 1,2000. The local newspaper carried an article claiming three of these flying black triangles were spotted by multiple witnesses. Again, on Aug. 13,2000, another Flying Black Triangle was viewed by multiple witnesses. These sightings occurred in the River Bourgeois area of Cape Breton near the Atlantic Ocean. The Cape Breton Post newspaper article of Aug. 25,2000, contains a representation of one of the objects. This photo was taken from the television screen as the witness played the master tape for the media. Ohio motorists surrounded by lights By George Pindroh and Rick Dell'Aquila The night of Saturday, July 22,2000, was clear and is normally very dark along State Route 11, a controlled access divided freeway between Warren and Ashtabula, Ohio. Locals refer to this area as \"Dead Man's Road\" or the \"Ohio Tundra\" because of its relative isolation. Some time before midnight, a motorist, her husband (a retired police officer), and their friend were driving along this road, northbound, on a return trip from a gambling junket in West Virginia. The parties confirmed they left West Virginia at 10:58 p.m., according to the digital automobile clock, on an approximately two-hour trip they had made many times. The driver's husband was seated next to her, and their friend was in the back seat of their recently purchased 1998 Cadillac. As the group approached a rest area in a particularly deserted part of the road, the husband pointed to two red blinking rights which appeared on or near the road in front of their vehicle and asked his wife, \"Honey, is that a truck in front of us?\" As they drove, they soon also observed red flashing lights on all four sides, low in the night sky just above the tree line (two or three at a time). These lights would also appear, disappear, and reappear, a few seconds at a time. Soon, a large light appeared to land in the road behind them, brightly illuminating the sky. The husband described its size and intensity as similar to an advertising searchlight. As they passed the rest area, the driver began to cry in fear. The driver observed this light three or four times in her mirror, and the husband and passenger turned and watched it through the rear window. The sky became brightly illuminated and a watery substance was \"sprayed\" onto the windshield. The driver described this as \"clear water, but very thick\" which beaded into droplets across only the bottom half of the windshield. When the wipers were later turned on, the substance left a \"greasy trail\" on the windshield. The group became highly frightened and agitated as the lights paced them most the way home (an estimated trip of 30 or 40 miles). The wife suggested she should stop to allow her husband to drive, but he told her it was safer to speed up and continue driving. At one point, the witnesses agree that \"everything went dark.\" By this they meant that the pavement and dashboard instruments were no longer illuminated. They"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 October 2000 MUFON UFO Journal also said that the ignition alarm began to \"bing\" at this time. (This alarm sounded at least three separate times, according to the husband). They felt that the total duration of this blackout was at most only a second or two. Although nothing could be seen, the vehicle continued on a straight line at a speed estimated to be in excess of 70 miles per hour. The driver said she felt \"paralyzed\" and [as though] \"I wasn't even there. I will never forget it.\" Soon thereafter, the objects behind them disappeared and the lights in their front and sides appeared farther away. As they neared home and were exiting onto Seven Hill Road, 25 to 30 of the lights were seen to cluster together (not touching), but no longer on the sides of the vehicle. The sky had an orange cast. Arriving home, (about 12:50 a.m. by a household clock) the husband telephoned the highway patrol and was referred to the MUFON investigation team after describing the ordeal to the dispatcher. On the way to church the following Sunday, the wife turned on the car radio, but heard only static. She attempted to adjust the radio, but could get only an Ontario, Canada, station because the music station radio presets were lost. At church, she couldn't even listen to the pastor due to her continued state of agitation. When the witnesses first called George Pindroh, they agreed to separately write down their experiences, with drawings, but not to discuss the sighting or compare notes. They later confirmed that they had kept this promise. The notes and drawings are in the possession of MUFON. An examination of the vehicle on July 25 disclosed an immaculately well-kept 1998 Cadillac with an engine compartment that appeared practically new and unused. The vehicle had been exposed to rain since the incident and no residue was observed on the windshield, the wipers, or under the hood. No further electronic problems were experienced. However, on turning the ignition key to the \"on\" position, the husband was surprised to discover that the digital clock was 13 minutes fast. The alarm sounded and the husband said this was the same sound heard the night of the incident. The witnesses said that a relative had been asked to reprogram the radio again to music stations. This party was called and confirmed that she had not changed the clock setting. It is theorized that the vehicle lost power while in motion sometime before midnight, perhaps for as long as 13 minutes. Power was restored, the clock defaulted to the 12:00 position, thereby accounting for its apparent time \"gain.\" The automobile was scheduled for a regular warranty visit to the dealer on July 27.

Pindroh spoke with another Cadillac dealer and an engineer, who both ruled out the possibility that the moisture had condensed on the windshield from the air conditioning system. On the night of the meeting with the witnesses, the investigators also visited the highway patrol post which the husband had called on Sunday morning. The dispatcher who took the call remembered it clearly and confirmed the agitation in the husband's voice. She also said that a trooper had reported seeing red lights in the sky the same night, but did not wish to be interviewed. She reported personally observing a silvery bright elongated object in the following Sunday morning sky which abruptly flew off out of sight."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 2000 Page 13 Were 1917 La Sal 'planes' Utah's first UFO sighting? By Rory Tyler Were the La Sal Mountains, Utah, the location of a UFO sighting early in the 20th century? Newspaper reports from the Grand Valley Times in 1917 describe a strange and inexplicable phenomena over the La Sal region in July of that year-a phenomena that remarkably resembles disturbing accounts that have become commonplace here at the end of the century. In mid-July, 1917, several mill workers on the south side of the La Sal Mountains observed a curious sight. According to the July 20,1917, edition of theGrand Valley Times, the workers spotted \"four airplanes, all equipped with strong searchlights\" east of La Sal between ten and eleven at night. \"The machines did considerable maneuvering above the La Sal flats\" and \"were evidently signaling to each other.\" According to the observers, \"Three of the machines came from the direction of Paradox (to the east), while the fourth sailed north from Monticello....One of the ships had a powerful light, and its signals consisted of a long brilliant flash. The other machines answered with short quick flashes. After hovering over La Sal for some time, the airplanes sailed southwest over Dry Valley and toward the junction of the Grand (now called the Colorado) and Green rivers\" the newspaper reported. The mill workers, \"on a high point in the La Sal Mountains commanding a broad view of the surrounding country,\" were \"emphatic in their declarations that the unusual visitors were airships, and that there can be no mistake about this matter.\" The phenomena caused \"much excitement'' among local residents, who speculated whether the objects were enemy aircraft or part of the government aero force that may have a base in that part of the country.\" The nearest known air base was the Army air training facility on the Mexican border in Columbus, NM, approximately 400 miles to the southeast. The Army had a large presence along the border where it had been futilely pursuing the Mexican rebel leader Pancho Villa around and across the Chihuahan desert. As to the other option, the United States had formally entered the World War that month by declaring war on Germany. It was feared that, for some unfathomable reason, German aircraft stationed in Mexico were performing night-time maneuvers and reconnaissance in the remote reaches of the Colorado Plateau. The government was notified of this strange sighting, and Leon Bone, a special investigator for the Justice Department, began an investigation. Bone contacted the War Department in Washington, D.C., and was informed that the department had no reports of planes flying over Utah from the Army air contingent stationed at Columbus, or any other regional air wing. However, it's unlikely that national or regional command posts would be informed of all flights from these air bases, so Bone apparently pursued a more detailed inquiry. After further investigation Bone became \"satisfied that enemy airplanes have been flying over southern Utah,\" according to theGrand Valley Timesof August 10,1917. We can assume that he reached this conclusion after contacting regional air bases and talking to their commanders. Apparently the flights had become a \"nightly\" occurrence. Bone asked the War Department to send airplanes to search for the headquarters of the mysterious aircraft. However, by Aug. 17 Bone had changed his mind, or at least his story. He sent a letter to the district forest office in Ogden, and the supervisor reported that \"aeroplanes, which have been quite frequent in the southern part of the district during the past few weeks, need cause no further agitation or concern on our part or that of the general public. Mr. Bone has thoroughly investigated the many reports which have been forwarded to this office concerning the presence of the mysterious aeroplanes, and, while he is not at liberty to divulge the circumstances surrounding the operation of these machines throughout this section, he assures us they are not enemy aircraft and their business is perfectly legitimate.\" However, Mr. Bone never said where the aircraft had come from. The sighting remains inexplicable, but phenomena of this nature are certainly not unheard of. The account of bright lights maneuvering over a remote mountain region and disappearing into the wild unknown is one that most contemporary reports readers are familiar with-a classic account of a UFO sighting. It seems implausible to suggest that the lights spotted by the mill workers in the La Sals were airplanes, American or otherwise. La Sals is 400 air miles from Columbus, NM, over 800 miles round-trip—far beyond the range of 1917 aircraft. To assume that primitive airplanes made such a flight carrying large searchlights, then engaged in \"considerable maneuvering and \"hovering\" on a \"frequent\" basis, is clearly unlikely. In addition, the lights disappeared to the southwest, in the direction of some of the most remote, inhospitable, and sparsely inhabited country in the U.S. (Reprinted, with permission, from Canyon Legacy, journal of the Dan O'Laurie Canyon Country Museum.

Scarpellini Field Investigator, Missouri MUFON and Chief Field Investigator, UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis Since publication of the description of the unusual events that occurred in early April 2000 (MUFON UFO Journal, June 2000) activity of all kinds in this South- ern Missouri area had diminished. During the winter of 1999-2000 numerous aerial phenomena, including white lights and orange/amber lights, were reported by many witnesses. This activity continued into early spring 2000, then abruptly diminished with only an occasional sighting of anything unusual. The property in this area that we frequently visit is a very active area, but over the sum- mer there was a 41-day period and yet another of 47 days when nothing was seen with the exception of a small aerial white light or two. Then in late July there were increasing reports of aerial phenomena, mostly white and orange lights. In early August sightings of lights were occurring fre- quently, with displays of multiple orange lights and several sightings of white \"strobe-like\" lights that arced up from or near ground level, usually seen over trees. These lights were seen in displays of 50 to 75 lights with a large number visible at one time. They were described as resembling fireworks, except they were all alike, the same color, the same motion from the ground up and back down, were of shorter duration than aerial fireworks, and were seen in uninhabited areas. Between mid-July and mid-August there were three reported incidences of a white light at nearly ground level, witnessed by several people, including myself. In all three cases the witnesses were driving on a paved road, a US Highway, and in all three cases the light was seen in almost exactly the same place at the same hour. The light traveled the same direction, South to North, in all three cases. The only major variation was that in one instance there were two lights seen (spaced as automobile headlights); in the other two instances there was only one light. The description is as follows and was nearly identi- cal from all of the witnesses, each of whom related the details not knowing anyone else had seen this phenom- enon: As the witnesses (myself included) were driving west on the highway a white light the size and height of a headlight/basketball appeared suddenly at the left side of the road, moving across the ditch, crossing the road, crossing the ditch on the right side of the road, then disappearing. There is no intersecting road that con- tinues from north to south across the highway where the light was seen (although there is one nearby that makes a \"T,\" it ends at the highway and does not con- tinue). One side is heavily wooded, both sides fenced, so there was no possibility of a car crossing there unless one came out of a field, crossed a ditch, the highway, another ditch and then went into the woods. If that had happened we would have been the first to the wreckage. There was none. The light I saw crossed the road with a bouncing motion, a total of seven bounces from start to finish, a period of about 6 sec- onds. When I first saw the light coming at right angles to the road upon which I was driving it was about 250- 300 ft. ahead of me. I stopped instantly on the road to avoid what I perceived as a possible collision. Then I realized it was not a car bouncing across the ditch and road, but a disembodied white light that vanished. The light was not visible long enough for me to get a cam- era out of its case on the back seat. Fortunately there is very little traffic on that road at that hour, so anyone stopping suddenly to avoid what they thought was an imminent collision could probably do so without be- ing hit by someone behind them. We have no inkling of how many times this light has been seen. It was brought to our attention that people other than myself have seen it by a person who commented on seeing what they thought was a car, and turned out to be a light, unattached to anything visible, then other witnesses followed. The others reporting this on other nights gave the same description in every detail except in the two other cases the light did not bounce but moved smoothly. We now wonder how many other people have seen this, not knowing there is no cross road, and assumed a car had crossed the road ahead of them. This light bears a distinct resemblance to a white light seen a number of times by numerous witnesses (including myself), hovering close over treetops or just above ground level in a grove of trees next to an open field. However, the light was moving when seen over the road and when seen over and in the trees it made only small apparently random movements, staying in the same place where it had appeared. In these in- stances it was visible for 10-15 seconds to as much as 15 minutes or more. The re-appearance of the aerial lights has provided an opportunity to attempt photography, with limited success. The lights appear only briefly, and it's diffi- cult to obtain photographs of high quality for several reasons, not the least of which is a continuing problem with suddenly discharged camera batteries."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 2000 Page 15 A Tribute Jeanne Andrus passes away Genevieve \"Jeanne\" Pirtle Andrus, 4 May 1923 - 20 September 2000 I don't recall exactly when I first met Jeanne, but it must have been back in 1978 or 1979 or so. She just seemed to be there as I became more and more involved with MUFON. In 1981,1 moved to San Antonio Texas, about 40 miles from Seguin. Soon I became very involved in the San Antonio MUFON group and began to see Walt on an average of about every two months. For a short while I worked in the MUFON Office in Seguin. From the beginning of our acquaintance, it seemed that Jeanne was the stability behind Walt as he kept up with his job and the frantic activities of MUFON. Jeanne found it hard to get frustrated or over-excited when it came to UFO matters, so as Walt reacted to new situations and occasional crises, Jeanne was there to keep the local situation normal. This is not to say Jeanne would never get upset. Once in awhile she would show her \"mustard,\" make up her mind, and stick with it. Although not into UFOs herself, Jeanne was there and it grew on her. For very many of her years being next to MUFON, Jeanne made the first cut at the mail and was part of the team for sorting and mailing out the Journal. For those same many years she sat at the MUFON table at nearly every MUFON Symposium from Friday through Sunday, as she did this year in St. Louis. It was at these symposia that I got to know her pretty well over the past 18 years. She guarded my camera and briefcase, and I sat in during busy times and for a couple of short and long breaks for her each day. Our conversations ranged from growing up as children and family life to population growth and the need for water in Texas. Seldom did we discuss UFO's except for the business side of it. At each symposium Walt had an open house on Saturday evening for the local sponsoring group, the speakers, the board members and special guests. At every one of those parties Jeanne was the planner, the coordinator and the chef-in-charge of the snack mix, which was simply scrumptious. She was a most precious and gracious hostess and mixed and mingled right into the morning—4:15 a.m. was the latest I can recall, and I think that was a record setter, and she was right there. During the period when I was working at the office I would have lunch with Jeanne and Walt, and in a small sense became part of the family. This was about the same Jeanne Andrus time Jeanne's health problems began, and in the following years I never heard one complaint. Most often, if she said anything at ah 1 , it was in jest, or in one way or another in some humorous form, often referring to her blood transfusions as \"getting recharged.\" Along the way she adopted my son, and for their great age difference, they very much enjoyed each other's company. Their last visit was as recent as a month ago. Regardless of the numbers of UFOlogists getting awards and accolades for their dedication to the business, I don't believe anyone deserves such praise any more than Jeanne Andrus. Jeanne was one of the most dedicated long standing supporters of our work that has ever come along. I think she thought it was better to join them than to be the Queen of UFO widows. Now she has left this mortal coil and looks down on us still fully supporting our efforts towards knowledge and truth. Her cheerful greeting and smiling face will be sorely missed by all who knew her. With our most sincere condolences to Walt and his family in this time of sadness. We wish them comfort in their precious loss. We salute you, Jeanne Andrus.

There is nobody anywhere in the world who knows more about the Sumerian and Assyrian/Babylonian civilizations than the British Museum in London. Their Western Asiatic Department has experts who read not only the cuneiform script, but also the much earlier Sumerian pictographic writing, and who also have authoritative knowledge of both mathematics and astronomy. If you consult them they will tell you, as they told me so long as twelve years ago, that while there is a vast wealth of material on Mesopotamian astronomy as a whole, NONE of it dates from before the Old Babylonin Period (2004 B.C. - 1595 B.C.). The pe- riod of the earlier Sumerian (pictographic) was the so- called Uruk IV and II and Early Dynastic I and II peri- ods, of 3,300 B.C. to 2,600 B.C., and as the British Museum can prove to you, there is not one single Sumerian tablet, brick, or any other sort of inscription whatsoever that treats of astronomical matters. They tell me that any talk of \"Sumerian astronomy\" is \"ar- rant nonsense.\" -Gordon W. Creighton, Editor, Flying Saucer Review Another Devil Thank you for publishing my article about the contactees of the fifties, introduced by Ann Druffel. Enclosed, you will find a new discovery done while I was writing another text about the diverse entities appearing in all the paranormal fields. Indeed, in the Dictionaire Infernal of Collin de Plancy (first printing in 1819-yes, 1819!), I have found a name of a devil, Orthon, exactly with the same spelling as that Orthon who would have encountered George Adamski in December 1952 in the Mojave desert. According to this source, \"a devil or a familiar spirit\" informed the Earl of Foix about all that occurred in the world. But he was not visible. One day he announced to the Earl all the details of the Juberoth battle just a day before the fight happened. And the Earl stated that these details were identical to the ones that occurred during the battle. Orthon was also the name of \"the devil or the familiar spirit\" of the Earl of Corasse, a friend of the Earl of Foix. According the same source, the Earl of Corasse often asked for a physical appearence of this entity because it was also not visible. But always Orthon refused. One day Orthon appeared to the Earl in the shape of an enormous sow. Skeptical, the Earl called his dogs on the sow, and it disappeared with an awful squeal. Since that day, Orthon never returned, but the Earl of Corasse died in the same year. Other details are quoted in my source, but the ones quoted above are the more important. I think it is another important proof showing that Adamski was manipulated or \"possessed\" by an entity having nothing to do with the so-called \"Space Brothers\" of Venus. More, this entity is not a physical being, but more probably a creature of undulatory nature, and has harrassed some humans for several centuries for an unknown aim.

Bourdais of the French Cometa Report (hereafter CR) UFOs and Defense. What must we be prepared for? together with \"A second view\" by J. Sider. Bourdais' paper is a good rendering of the Report and needs no particular comment except about its title. CR is in no way a \"quasi-official French document\" (Bourdais), nor \"a document making quasi-official the UFO phenomena\" with manifestations \"admitted publicly under the cover of a body close to the Ministry of Defense (the IHEDN).\" (Sider) Some UFO journals in France have even written that the French President and his Prime Minister have \"accepted that the Report be made available to the public\" or that \"if this strictly confidential report was communicated to the media, it was necessarily with the permission of the highest government authorities,\" or more or less equivalent formulations. Truth is less exciting, and an announcement such as \"The confidential report delivered to the president de la Republique and the Premier ministre\" is only a publicity trick used by VSD, the news magazine which published the document in a special issue. In his review of CR, Perry Petrakis (\"La guerre des mondes, version COMETA,\" Phenomena, 1999, no. 42: 15-19) gives the two following reactions from concerned people. \"Honour to whom honour is due, the Institute of Advanced Studies for National Defense (IHEDN) does not want to hear of the Cometa Report.

At Matignon (the Prime minister palace), Mr. Henri Petitgand, official representative, confirms to have received something by mail. 'It is in no case a report. Reports are requested documents, but here we requested nothing, the document was send to us by mail as any ordinary letter, on the authors' own initiative.' The term 'report' noted on the cover would thus be somewhat usurped.\" As for myself, I wrote on Jan. 31 directly to the following authorities in order to get their direct opinion about the status they give to CR: France's President, France's Prime Minister, the General commanding the IHEDN, and the President of COMETA. Here are the answers I received. In a letter of Feb. 23, General Bastien, of the Private Staff of the President, writes that \"This 'report,' made by the members of a 1901-type association [1901 was the date of a law governing most private non-commercial associations] and corresponding to no official request, has no particular status. You will have noted (p. 7) that according to its authors, this 'report' was, among other purposes, intended to inform the deciders about the UFO problem. In such a spirit, a copy was thus sent to the President for information purpose.\" And for Lieutenant-Colonel Pierre Bayle, head of the Communication Office at the IHEDN, \"the Institute of Advanced Studies for National Defense specifies that the statements made by these persons are binding only themselves, and are in no way a reflection of the thought of the IHEDN, which has no specific element about that matter.\" One can of course claim that such statements are misleading, because the military and political authorities are well aware of the reality of UFOs. These official positions are, however, confirmed by Michel Algrin's letter of April 18: the Cometa spokesman writes that \"the Association Cometa has no responsibility in the mistaken presentations of its report which were made here or there.\" In any case, the above positions are the only objective official evidence we have about the status of CR. As long as we perceive CR as an attempt to show that the UFO phenomenon is a priori worthy of interest as much for natural or human scientists as for the various specialists in defense matters, we can consider that the report has reasonably fulfilled its goal, even if one can discuss the reliability of one or another reported case. But the authors write in their Introduction that they intended to sum up the situation of our knowledge about UFOs, and particularly of scientific works. They did not achieve this mission, for many aspects of the phenomenon are not taken into account. For example, there is not one abduction story, although abduction claims are a major part of the problem-whatever we think about them. Very few physical effects are considered, and the Pocantico Report is given only four lines. Likewise, statistical considerations are nearly missing (a short out-of-date paragraph), as well as any mention of private ufology-except for a few lines for three U.S. associations (the names of CUFOS, FUFOR, and MUFON appear only with their endorsements of the Unidentified Flying Objects Briefing Document, which is said to be Marie Galbraith's book). More fundamentally, there is in CR a major contradiction. The authors consider that true UFOs do exist and that \"the extraterrestrial hypothesis is by far the best scientific hypothesis,\" a position I don't share, but which is respectable. And they have developed military, political and sociological consequences of such a hypothesis. But they proceeded as if they discovered a situation the government was not aware of. This seems somewhat strange. If UFOs are extraterrestrial craft flying above us, many governments, including France's, necessarily know already what is happening on Earth, and they have necessarily taken measures (even if secret ones)-either altruistically for the benefit of mankind or egotistically for the benefit of their own nation's or private interests. But how then explain that the CR authors acted exactly as if this necessarily existing official implication did not exist? Because it does not exist? This seems rather hard to believe, unless there are no things such as true UFOs. Because they have no knowledge of such an existing implication? This is more sensible, but it would mean that the impressive members of Cometa would not be experts about UFO matters as qualified as it was said. Or because they chose to short-circuit something existing they were aware of? This sounds better, but one might claim that such an attitude borders on treason. And why then send a very partial report to the already informed President and Prime Minister, while this report considers them as not informed people? Anybody can have his (her) own interpretation for such interrogations. As for myself, I see for the time being no compelling reason for choosing another one than the simplest: there is no official secret investigation about UFOs in France, because the government is in no way concerned by the UFO problem. Non-French ufologists could argue that the very existence of SEPRA (formerly GEPAN) proves that authorities are truly concerned. They are possibly not aware that SEPRA is a very low priority (and budget) sub-service within the National Center of Space Studies (CNES), and that its research missions are now extremely limited-exactly as if the authorities had no real concern in UFOs and needed only a public relations office. -Claude Mauge"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 October 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Filer's Files George A.

They saw a large glowing light moving very swiftly underwater from the general direction of just east of Santa Catalina Island towards them. They watched the light surge toward the cl i ffs below, but their view was blocked by the cliffs: Suddenly a bright UFO flew up over the cliff's edge and over their heads, and up the ravine cut into the steep slope of the mountain. They chased after it with their sports car speeding up the road, then drove off the road as high up as they could go. They then ran further up the hill toward residences high up the mountain. Abruptly, they were accosted by a policeman in an \"odd\" uniform and police car, who asked them what they were doing there. They told him what they saw, and that they were investigating it. He told them that they were trespassing on private property and that they would have to leave, so they did.

The lights would also go up and down several times, and also move side to side before eventually disappearing from view. At around 10:25 p.m., two witnesses were taking a long walk alongLake Ramsey on Aug. 25,2000, watching a freight train and noticed a red light which looked to be at the water's edge. As they walked a few more yards, they watched in amazement as the red light suddenly zipped across Ramsey Lake, from west to east and disappeared. It traveled at level flight with a speed of a jet fighter. The basketball-size light remained bright red and flew 5 or 10 feet high. Canadian triangles ALBERTA, GUNN - Two witnesses reprted that they were driving on Aug. 25, 2000, when they saw a bright light towards the town of Onoway, then two lights, one greenish-blue and one red, at the front of the craft at 10:05 p.m. As it got closer they saw a third yellow-orange light. The craft was triangular-shaped, but was square on the corners. It hovered at 400 meters in altitude, started to move westward, and flew directly above them. It stayed in the area for awhile before there was a flash like lightning that lit up the sky and the craft was gone. Canadian white ball MATTAWA, ONTARIO - On Aug. 26 and 27, thirteen miles of north of Mattawa, a Sudbury resident reported that he and his cousin watched as a large white ball of light floated across the sky at 9 p.m. It was ten times bigger than the brightest star. A camper who wasn't much of a believer in UFOs, said: \"Look at that star! How come it's zigzagging like that?\" They all stepped away from the fire and looked up in the sky. The white light was pulsating with different colors. It started to go up and down, then move from side to side. It would shoot straight up and come right down again. They were amazed by what it did and watched it for almost 20 minutes before it disappeared behind the tree line, over another mountain. Ten minutes later, as they were talking about a second flash, a third one appeared in the southern sky. It wasn't high in the sky, but was doing the same thing as the second one, dancing up and down, zigzagging all over. They watched it for almost an hour before they got tired of looking at it.

Hind passed away on Aug. 21,2000, in Harare (formerly Salisbury), Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia), a victim of cancer. Joining MUFON in 1974, she served as a Field Investigator and Representative for Zimbabwe, and in 1981 became the MUFON Continental Coordinator for Africa. Cynthia enrolled at Cape Town University in 1942, studying for a B.A. in English and minor in psychology, but in 1944 joined the South African Women's Army Air Force before completing her degree. She married an R.A.F. pilot and lived in northern England for 11 years, where her two children, a son and daughter, „ .. „. , were bom.  Cynthia Hind She and her husband, Norman, emigrated back to Rhodesia in 1957 and built a furniture factory, with her father as a partner. They sold the factory in 1983, allowing Cynthia to devote more time to writing and UFO research. Norman died in 1986. Cynthia's first UFO book, UFOs—African Encounters, was published in 1982 in Zimbabwe. She has been frequently published in the MUFON UFO Journal, and recently sent the editor a number of copies of her fine publication, UFOAFRINEWS, for possible wider publication of African cases in the Journal. She was one of the few researchers to actively obtain reports from native Africans. She has been a featured speaker at MUFON Symposia in 1981,1984,1987,1993 and 1997.

Randle, Ph.D., Quill (HarperCollins), 5X8 paperback, 402 pages, $15.00. Reviewed by D wight Connelly Kevin Randle, one of the more prolific writers in the field of ufology, as well as one of the recognized \"experts\" on Roswell, has put together a helpful and interesting book; For the most part it reflects his own conclusions that there was a crash at Roswell which involved an extra- terrestrial vehicle, but he also includes nearly 30 pages in which Kent Jeffries explains why the crash at Roswell was not that of an extraterrestrial craft. Randle is no newcomer to Roswell, having co- authored The UFO Crash at Roswell and The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell. He provides con- siderable evidence that something out of the ordinary occurred, while acknowledging that some of his ear- lier conclusions must be reconsidered in the light of new evidence, such as the seeming lack of credibility of Glenn Dennis and Jim Ragsdale. The author is also not impressed with the MJ-12 documents, nor with Lt. Col. Philip Corso and his book The Day After Roswell, and he explains why in a logi- cal and fair manner. There are many items covered in the 402 pages, some with a short presentation and some covering several pages and featuring photos. As Randle notes in the Introduction, \"What we have here can be seen as a book exploring the Roswell case from the perspective of the late 1990s. It contains the latest information about various aspects of the case and reveals where we all have gone astray in the past.\" He further notes, \"It also provides some commen- tary on the investigators of the case, for in order to understand the history, it is necesssary to understand the reporters of that history.\" A very good point. Since this is an \"encyclopedia,\" the entries are al- phabetical. The material would have been much easier to locate if each page (or every other page) had been marked with the subject matter being discussed-or with the appropriate letter of the alphabet. Another plus would have been an index, since some of the longer entries include individuals and other items not listed as topics. Occasional cross-references to other articles do help, however. Is there anything new or better here that would war- rant the purchase of another Roswell book? Yes, I think so. Roswell is still one of the key cases, despite the naysayers, and this book includes updated infor- mation by one of the Roswell researchers worth read- ing. This is a lot of book for the price. The Little Giant Encyclopedia of UFOs by Jenny Randies, Sterling Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 4\" X 5\" paperback, 511 pages, $9.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly With an author like British ufologist Jenny Randies, you expect quality, and this little encyclopedia is in- deed well done-at least from an editorial standpoint. This is a well-organized presentation that is almost thesis-like, duplicating none of the several encyclope- dias that have been published in recent years. Part One is a \"UFO Timeline,\" beginning in 911 B.C. and extending to the present, providing an excel- lent capsule history of the development of ufology. Part Two looks at the evidence for UFOs, divided accord- ing to types of encounters and types of evidence, rang- ing from lights in the sky to Close Encounters of the Fourth Kind. Part Three looks at \"UFOs Worldwide,\" scanning countries from Argentina to the United States and hit- ting key cases in each country. Part Four, \"UFO Sources,\" lists alphabetically most of the significant organizations, researchers, and publications, as well as some witnesses directly involved in specific cases. One could quibble with what is included versus what is omitted in this section (Philip Klass, Albert Budden, and Bertrand Meheust are included, but Travis Walton, Roswell, Kelly Cahill, and W. C. Levengood are not, as just a few examples). Interestingly, Randies left her own name and biography out, perhaps due to mod- esty, but should have been included it. This, like other encyclopedias, is an ambitious project, made easier for Randies, of course, by her many years of research and writing in the field. She has not taken a quick and easy approach, however, and has produced a nice reference volume which is fun to scan. There is little depth, but a great breadth. The fairly extensive index is quite helpful, and the Introduction has good instructions on using the volume. It is unfortunate that this fine material is in a poor package. Only 4 inches wide and five inches high, one would think it would lend itself to easy portability and usage. However, it is nearly one and one-half inches thick, and this thickness makes usage some- what cumbersome. It's cute, but not very functional. The paperback binding is not designed for much us- age, and my copy already has some loose pages. The fact that this is one in a series of \"Little Giant\" ency- clopedias on various subjects, probably accounts for the format, but it's a shame that it could not have been presented in a better binding and page size. Despite the shortcomings, this is a good buy at $9.95. I have at least five UFO encyclopedias, but I consider this a worthwhile addition to my library."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal October 2000 Page 21 The NIGHT SKY November 2000 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.1) can be seen low in the SW after sunset, setting about 6:30 in mid-November.

Peak counts of from 3,000 to 4,000 per hour were reported—the greatest Leonid display since 1966! This year's predictions are mixed and also tempered by interfering moonlight. One forecast favors North America with a meteor storm that peaks about 4:30 a.m. EST on the 17th of this month. Another prediction, however, puts the peak hourly rate at only about 100 or more at 3 a.m. EST on the 18th. Obviously, U.S: observers should be prepared for anything on either morning.

Having discussed my misgivings about the past column format with Dwight Connelly, we have agreed to try something new. I felt increasingly that being required to respond primarily to material in the previous issue more or less put me in a position of constantly second-guessing everyone. Instead, I would rather comment more generally on basic issues that appear in the Journal over time. Dwight agreed that this would make better use of my knowledge and experience. Since criticism and peer review are an important part of the scientific method, I .will still offer my comments on specific articles on occasion .to illustrate points I am trying to make. The stated MUFON mission of \"systematic collection and analysis of data...\" will be my theme this time. In my strongly empirical approach to UFO research, I see excessive speculation as an exercise in futility that often leads to self-deception. The MUFON database reported in the September issue definitely is important and worthwhile. Data and their analysis is what it's all about. Airy pronouncements from on high by self-styled \"experts\" are a dime a dozen. True science requires careful screening and analysis of data by people with expertise in the areas in question. The amateurism so rampant in what we like to call \"ufology\" is one of our curses and tends to make us a laughing stock to people who matter. Both the MUFON database and UFOCAT, the recently updated and expanded CUFOS database, will be important basic tools in trying to obtain some meaningful answers (as opposed to woolly speculation) about UFOs. In the long run, I feel that it is important for MUFON, especially in the pages of the Journal, which is the face of the organization seen by most people, to display a critical-minded, analytical, scientific approach to the UFO mystery. People who are basically seeking entertainment or titillation should look elsewhere. I do not mean that the Journal should contain only dense scientific articles replete with mathematical formulae. Good science reporting does not require that. General news reporting, book reviews, dialogue via the MUFON Forum, and brief articles are all important to obtaining a rounded picture of the UFO mystery. Nor do we need to avoid controversy about such matters as the Roswell case(s), whose importance, if true, clearly is paramount. What we need to avoid is appearing to accept questionable information as valid at face value, and instead exercising critical judgment at all times: In the September issue is a letter in the Forum titled \"Adamski supported,\" which I wish to comment on. Having personally investigated or supervised investigation of many of Adamski's claims while at NICAP, I consider him to have been a total fraud. I am sorry to see that people still want to believe otherwise. He made claims in Kansas City that our investigators proved to be false. He constantly claimed to be supported by people, or to have privileged meetings with people, which grossly misrepresented the facts. To my personal knowledge, he lied about having an endorsement by the late Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who told me that she had no idea who this man was and certainly did not support him. When I read Adamski's first book, its simplicity and straightforwardness made me want to believe it was true. How neat to meet a spaceman in the desert and to attempt communication through sign language! Later I was forced by the established facts to change my mind. At the Library of Congress I read his pre-UFO book, \"Pioneers of Space,\" which clearly established that Adamski was merely embellishing on beliefs he had already been propounding for years and now was attributing to spacemen. As his books multiplied, his originally noncommunicative spaceman metamorphosed into garrulous creatures from many different places and the contradictions multiplied. Dr. Morris Jessup's writings do not in any way support Adamski's claims. Space exploration, in fact, has refuted several of his claims about the Moon and Venus. I have seen the Rodeffer film cited, and it obviously is a model on a string bobbing around in a fashion that can only be described as ludicrous. How anyone can take this film as serious evidence of anything boggles the mind. The alleged visit to the Vatican unquestionably is at best an embellishment, testified to only by a fawning disciple. His burial at Arlington National Cemetery, often cited as some kind of proof that he was an important person is absolutely meaningless. Any veteran is entitled to be buried there. This commentary only scratches the surface, but it would take too much space to provide all the details. In my estimation based on factual research and evaluation of data, Adamski was a fraud and a con man. The evidence for this is rather overwhelming. For anyone who needs to examine the facts for themselves, a good place to start is The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial by Jerome Clark (Detroit: Omnigraphics, Inc., 1998), pp. 18-24.

(continued from page 24) Several members have sent suggestions for change, and we appreciate it. We are collecting these suggestions and looking for ways to factor as many as possible into the way we operate. Unfortunately, some of the suggestions cannot be implemented at this time because of financial constraints or other restrictions. Hopefully, these restrictions will cease as we grow. One of the early improvements involved the communications process. We selected a combination of the MUFON UFO Journal, the annual UFO symposium proceedings, case files on a CD Rom, and the new web site and database to cover events in the UFO field. In addition, many MUFON state groups have web site links and newsletters, and one of our Regional Directors, George Filer, issues a weekly report via e-mail. To make further improvements we need to increase the MUFON membership. A good portion of the annual dues goes for the publication of ihe Journal, and the rest finances all other MUFON operations. Contrary to some recent Internet misinformation, MUFON does not receive millions of dollars from special benefactors, although we would be pleased if it did happen. In the meantime, we must do the fundraising ourselves by increasing the number of MUFON members.
