Col., USAF Ret. O n July I, 1977, Aviano Air Base (AB), Italy ex- perienced an encounter with a UFO. The object was first observed beyond the perimeter fence off base, northwest of the Victor Alert facility at ap- proximately 3:00 AM. The Victor Alert compound was an aircraft ready alert facility where aircraft, crews, maintenance and support personnel were housed for the purpose of immediate launch of the aircraft in the event hostilities occurred with the Warsaw Pact mem- bers. Aviano Air Base (AB), Italy is a shared NATO base operated by the USAF under the control of the Italian Defense Ministry. Aviano is currently the Headquarters 16th Air Force and the 31st Fighter Wing. Due to the downsizing of the United States Air Forces Europe and the Bosnian Conflict, the base has increased in mission and responsibility. Aviano AB has recently been in the spotlight of in- ternational news as a result of the Bosnian Conflict and the rescue of Air Force Captain Scotty O'Grady. The base today serves as a vital link in the NATO and Southern European Defense chain. Aviano sits about an hour's train ride northeast of Venice at the foot of the picturesque Dolomite Mountains. From June 1991 until my retirement in July 1993, I was assigned to the base. While there, I served as the logistics officer Deputy Commander for Resource Management and as the Deputy Commander for the Regional Support Group which placed me in contact with all base agencies. With my private interest in UFO research, I would oc- casionally bring up the story of the July 1, 1977 UFO in- cident as is described in Mr. Timothy Good's book Above Top Secret. Eventually word spread among my friends and a first sergeant assigned to the civil engi- neering squadron contacted me and asked if we could meet. He indicated that he had been on duty as a security police communications controller the night of the event. The Security Police Control Center was only a few yards from the Victor Alert Aircraft Facility. Near the end of his tour, I had the opportunity to discuss the event with him at length and tape recorded the conver- sation. His knowledge of the event and proximity to the object allowed him to make observations which were detailed and thorough. We are keeping his name anonymous to protect his privacy. The gentleman's name is on file with Mr. Walt Andrus at the Mutual UFO Network Inc. For the sake of the article, I will re- fer to the NCO as Sgt. Robert Frank. Today Senior Master Sergeant Frank remains on active duty and is currently assigned stateside. In July 1977. Aviano was home to the 40th Tactical Group which served as a forward basing installation for F-4 fighter aircraft from the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, Torrejon AB, (Madrid) Spain. These fighters pro- vided tactical air support for the southern European NATO members against the Warsaw Pact countries due to Aviano's close proximity to the Yugoslavian border. During this period Sgt. Robert Frank was an E-5 mem- ber of the security police squadron working in the Security Control Center Building 1170 which was only a few yards from the Victor Alert facility. I began the interview by asking Sgt. Robert Frank (R.F.) to describe the weather conditions and how the se- curity facility had been alerted the night of the inci- dent. FEBRUARY 1996 NUMBER 334 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL / had no special night vision equipment or binoculars. I just observed it with my eyes, you didn't need anything else because it was a very bright light. It was circular... R.F. It was about 3:00 AM, the weather was very clear, warm, yet was the coolest of the evening hours. I recall there was a full or quarter moon which was still fairly high in the sky. There was no ground fog present due to the temperature. The security control center was ini-. tially alerted when our control sensors activated. The Victor Alert facility had a high hurricane type fence with concertina wire mounted on top. The fence was also reinforced by magnetic and motion detectors. A se- curity control tower was located in the corner of the fa- cility and manned by a security police member. He con- tacted us reporting that all alarms had gone off at the same time. He quickly searched the area visually and no- ticed a light off to the northwest (off base), beyond the perimeter fence in an adjoining soybean field. When the alarm activation occurred the alert facility also experi- enced a power outage simultaneously. The Victor Alert facility is designed to deal with an outage and the aux- iliary power back-up system kicked in immediately. There were some minor power fluxes for the next 15 to 20 minutes. As was established procedure, I notified the Wing Command Post that we had a security situation in progress and that a security response team had been dispatched in and around the facility to determine if anyone was intruding into the area. The only thing they reported back to us was that there were lights off in the direction of the northwest beyond the base perimeter fence. The lights were towards the mountains on what we called the back corner of the flight line. By my own observation 1 would estimate that the lights were roughly 200 meters beyond the fence line. Jerry Rolwes (J.R.) When did you first see the lights? R.F. Once I completed all my reporting responsibilities to the Command Post, one of the security teams came down and relieved me so I could go up on top of my building to take a look. Our Security Control Center was an underground facility. The time that had elapsed from when I first received the reports to when 1 was relieved in order to observe the object from outside our facility was approximately 15 minutes. J.R. Did you observe the object with any optical equip- ment such as binoculars or night vision scopes? What can you tell us about the visual appearance or sound of the object? R.F. I had no special night vision equipment or binocu- lars. I just observed it with my eyes, you didn't need anything else because it was a very bright light. It was circular. In Above Top Secret it indicates it had a domed top. Because of the intensity of the lights especially around the rim, it was kind of hard to see beyond the glare. From my vantage point, 1 could not determine if there was any silhouette of a dome like shape or the like. It seemed to have multiple lights. In Mr. Good's book, he described the lights going through different colors from white to green and then to red. As I recall, it was more from yellow to orange to red. 1 didn't notice any green lighting on the craft. While I was observing the object you could hear a sound like bees buzzing or a humming sound. There was also a high amount of static electricity in the air and you could feel it on the hair on your arms. You could definitely feel the static. Outside of that phenomena, there were no other changes to the atmosphere when the object changed color. J.R. For the purpose of setting the record straight in re- lation to what was reported in Mr. Good's book Above Top Secret, was the object ever above the Victor Alert Area or above the Aviano runway or flight line? R.F. I had no reports of it and I never saw it above the base myself. It was always over the field off the base. J.R. So it stayed over the soybean field. Did it ever make any motion towards the base? R.F, Not that I know of. No one reported any such movement toward the base proper. J.R. Was any type of security response team dispatched off base to the location of the object? R.F, Because it was a NATO base, a combined USAF Security Police and Carabinieri (National Italian Police) unit was dispatched off base on patrol to determine the nature of the object. As a result of the layout of the base, the combined police response team was required to take a long route around the base through a couple of small villages. By the time they arrived, the object had departed. It just gradually inclined and took off towards the corner of the mountains. When it started moving away it ^.uned altitude in a gradual slope. J R W.xs there any increase in the static in the air, t h mjjc- m the coloration or sound of the craft when it be- gan 10 depart the area? R.F. I don't recall any increase in the static. The buzzing sound increased. It got just a little louder and a little higher pitched. When the buzz increased in pitch the color started to fluctuate, it went from yellow, orange to red in a gradual manner. It stayed more toward the red- dish color as it moved away. PAGE 4 NUMBER 334 FEBRUARY 1996"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL J.R. How long did you observe the object? Please de- scribe the object. R.E 1 observed the object for a total of about five minutes while it was over the soybean field and about another minute when it started to depart the area. We all lost sight of it when it headed toward the corner of the moun- tain range. It might have dropped down below the edge of the mountain crest. For the sake of explanation, Aviano AB flight line is situated approximately three kilometers south of the base of the Dolomite Mountains.The mountains rise to about 6000 feet above sea level with the mountain range to the northwest slop- ing down to almost the level of the plain and then raising back to a higher elevation. As the craft left the area, it picked up speed and maintained a consistent straight course toward the mountain pass. From where [ ob- served the object, I was about 500 meters from the craft and well inside the perimeter fence. The object was ap- proximately 200 meters beyond the fence line to the northwest. J.R. Did the craft pick up speed the further it got away from Aviano? R.F. It seemed to accelerate a little faster the further it went away, but at night, it's kind of hard to tell when something is moving directJy away from you. The angle between where I was and the comer of the mountain was a straight line. Its flight characteristic was very straight and stable until we lost it visually in the distance. J.R. Could you estimate the diameter of the craft when it was the closest to you? R.F. As T said previously, I estimate that 1 was about 500 meters from the object. It appeared to be somewhere in the vicinity of 35 meters; maybe 75 to 100 feet in di- ameter. That's about the best I can do. J R Could you please discuss for a moment the power ouLijx 1 m relation to what was described in Above Top S< i H i The book refers to a total power outage when it left ilie area. Is this an inaccuracy? R.F. When the event occurred, I was only concerned with the Victor Men f.icility. We had a power loss, but then the back-up generators kicked in and we only had some minor pcmu llunes which is characteristic with back-up generators. A> far as the rest of the base, to my memory, it was not completely blacked out. I could see some lights across the field from where 1 was located. J.R. Were there any after action reports you had to fill out as a result of the event? Did the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), or security police in- vestigations require security oaths from the witnesses? Because of the intensity of the lights espe- cially around the rim, it was kind of hard to see beyond the glare. From my vantage point, I could not determine if there was any silhouette of a dome like shape or the like. It seemed to have multiple lights. R.F. No one from security police investigations or AFOSI contacted me or any of the other witnesses and there were no security oaths requested or signed. J.R. What was the general consensus on the base after the event occurred? R.F. There was a lot of speculation about some sort of UFO or something around the base. But the talk just kind of died away and the incident was more or less ignored. J.R. In both Tim Good's book Above Top Secret, and Jenny Randies' book The UFO Conspiracy, they refer to an NCO or soldier by the name of James Blake who had leaked the incident to local investigators. In that context they allude to a cover-up by the local base authorities at Aviano concerning the incident. Did you know a James Blake and again did you encounter any Air Force efforts to cover or minimize the incident? R.F. I have a slight memory of an Airman James Blake who was a security cop. I had seen him a couple of times, but had no relationship with him. As to a cover-up as I said before, there were no security oaths requested or taken. The base experienced a situation and we couldn't explain what it was. The Security Police law enforcement personnel with the Italian Carabinieri National Police went out, looked around the field and found nothing of significance. The object did not intrude on or over the base and did not really affect anything off- base from what could be determined. It was just a report of a weird incident and they let it go at that. J.R. Did you observe the Carabinieri and the USAF Security Police approaching the area or the object before it departed the area? R.F. I know the Security Police were dispatched out, but to get to the back side of the base to where it was over the soybean field took them ten to fifteen minutes dri- ving time. It was necessary for them to go through some of the smaller villages north of the flight line base fa- cility. By the time they arrived the craft had departed. We could see them out there when they arrived at the site. They were not operating in an emergency mode with their blue emergency lights flashing. They pulled up quietly, looked around the area. They did not find any damage to the field and then they left. FEBRUARY 1996 NUMBER 334 PACES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL / do feel the craft was observing us. I did not have any feelings it was hostile or that we were threatened by the object because it made no movements or actions toward us. We certainly took no hostile actions toward it. J.R. Did you feel the object was sitting on the ground or was it hovering above the ground or could you really tell? R.F. From my location it looked like it was above the ground, but the exact height I'm not sure, maybe 30 feet, maybe a little lower. J.R. Do you have any final comments concerning this in- cident? R.F. I felt at the time the craft was nothing we knew about. I don't feel it was an experimental aircraft from our Air Force or anyone else's for that matter. If it were an experimental craft, I doubt they would have flown it in unannounced and then hover it over a soybean field next to an active alert facility. If it was a classified tech- nology encountering flight troubles there would have been more security involvement through secure com- munications channels. I do feel the craft was observing us. I did not have any feelings it was hostile or that we were threatened by the object because it made no move- ments or actions toward us. We certainly took no hostile actions toward it. Those of us who observed it were in a stand-off mode. We were observing it and trying to fig- ure out what it was. It was near the ground a very short time and to my knowledge there were no photos taken of it. I'm not sure if the incident appeared in the Italian press because I don't read Italian. I can say, it did not ap- pear in the base paper or the Armed Forces Stars and Stripes. CONCLUSION: The astronomy program \"The Sky for Windows 2.0 1994\" by Software Bisque described the following sky conditions the night of the event. On July I, 1977, there was almost a full moon setting in the SW approximately 14.5 degrees above the horizon in the constellation Sagittarius at about 3:00 AM. The craft appeared NW of the Victor Alert facility hovering near the ground. SMSgt Frank made it very clear there were no secu- rity oaths requested or post incident briefings conducted concerning the incident. He said there were at least 18 personnel in the Victor Alert area at the time who ob- served the craft. Ten personnel were standing across the street against the outer perimeter fence in order to get a better view of the object. While I worked in Wing Headquarters I had access to the Wing's historical office records through the Air Force sergeant in charge of the program. She researched both the classified and un- classified records for the July I, 1977 date and the quar- ter's history it would have appeared in. In both cases she found no references to the incident. My knowledge of required inputs to a wing history leaves the administrators quite a degree of flexibility. Certain standardized information and reports are re- quired such as sortie/maintenance rates and budgetary actions to name a couple. An incident recorded on a USAF security police blotter may or may not end up in the wing history. The security police blotter would be re- tained in an active file for the calendar year it was pre- pared. It would then be retained in an inactive file for an additional year. Once this period ended it would be de- stroyed per IAW USAF directives. In light of the fact that no intrusion or hostile ac- tions were made over or into the Victor Alert facility or over the flight line it is very logical and consistent with administrative procedures that no reference from the blotter would have been entered into the wing's quarterly history. It is obvious something of an unknown nature did occur at Aviano AB, Italy on July 1, 1977. As a re- sult of nothing serious ensuing, there was no need to el- evate the security response or administrative reporting of the incident. I feel this is an example where partial in- formation was obtained and faulty conclusions were drawn by other investigators as to an \"alleged cover-up,\" 'which was non-existent. Even for a non-military mem- ber it would be easy to seek information on the incident as I did. When further information was not found it was also easy to determine why and what the lack of that information meant. REFERENCES 1.

Raines Investigated by Francis Ridge, Linda Dahlkemper, Bruce Engstrom, Robert Taylor, Roger Sugden and John Timmerman Abstract Eight adult witnesses saw a self-luminous disk fly across the sky at a campground in northern Indiana at 9:30 pm (EOT) on August 31, 1994 on a clear dark night. Five 35 mm. color photographs were taken over about a 25-second interval with a Kodak K-40 camera. Four of the frames show an angularly large object. This paper describes the re- sults of measurements, calculations, and various digital quantifications. Knowledge of the approximate maximum dis- tance to the object from two different ground vantage points and the angular size of the aerial object shows that it was about 19 feet in length and 8.5 feet thick (at an assumed range of 2300 feet). Further analysis suggests the object trav- eled approximately 3900 feet over a 30-second time span. Assuming a constant velocity, its ground speed would have been approximately 192 mph — significantly faster than a blimp can fly in calm air. The suggestion that the object was an internally illuminated advertising blimp is rejected on other grounds as well. The object remains unidentified. D IGITAL IMAGE ANALYSIS RESULTS: Frames 4-7 were scanned with a LaCie Ltd., Silver Scanner II and analyzed by Dr. Richard F. Haines using Adobe Photoshop software on a Power Macintosh model 7100/66. THE ADVERTISING BLIMP HYPOTHESIS: It was suggested that the UFO was an internally illuminated ad- vertising blimp on the basis of the fact that a blimp definitely was in the area that evening (Anon., 1994 [a]; Anon.,1994 [b]) and similarities in general shape of video images obtained previously in other geographic lo- cales by several people (Kelley,1995; Sainio, 1993). We will evaluate this suggestion in light of each piece of evidence. Mr. J. K. said that he went hunting the next day and saw the \"Family Channel Blimp\" flying nearby. He remarked to the investigator, Francis Ridge, \"There's no way in hell (that) we saw a blimp that night.\" As will be seen, several different avenues were followed to test this personal assessment by the eyewitness. BASIC BLIMP CHARACTERISTICS: Francis Ridge and Mr. John Timmerman of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) separately contacted various lighter-than-air ship manufacturers for specifi- cations, illustrations, and flight schedules. Figure 12 (not shown here)is a drawing of the \"Lightship\" built by the American Blimp Corporation of Hillsboro, Oregon. Four variations are sold which vary in length but not in width-to-length ratio. The overall length of the A-150 model is 128 feet and its maximum diameter is 30' 10\" for a width to length ratio of 0.24 (about one-half of the measured width to length ratio of the UFO seen in frames 4 and 5; viz. 0.444 and 0.452, respectively). One shorter and two slightly longer models than the A-ISO are manufactured by this company. The top speed of this model is 55 mph using two 68 hp German Limbach engines, each operating at 2900 RPM. The maximum rate of climb for this blimp is 1600 feet per minute and 1400 fpm maximum rate of de- scent. Its rated service ceiling is 7800 feet and maximum range without refueling at 40 mph is 560 nautical miles. Its minimum turn radius is 375 feet. Needless to say, its ability to accelerate is very limited. More importantly, the outer skin of these blimps is made from a tough woven fabric and plastic film that is translucent. Spotlights located inside it make the entire blimp glow relatively evenly. The advertising panels on the sides of the blimp do not move relative to the blimp itself but are attached by numerous tie-down cords. A blimp was in the area. (Ridge: \"One newspaper ac- count said that The Family Channel blimp was respon- sible for reports in northern Indiana at that time.\") Kelley (1995) reported that a blimp owned by the Virgin FEBRUARY 1996 NUMBER 334 PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Figure 1 Drawing of General Area of Sighting North Estimated Visual path o. aerial object (not to scale) Est. location of two hunters St. RD. 3 Lightship Co.

If a blimp was the source of these photographs its reciprocating engines would probably also have been heard at distances under about 2,000 to 3,000 feet in the calm night air. No such sounds were heard by anyone. Blimp shape. Several previously recorded VMS seg- ments of positively identified blimps were analyzed by Jeff Sainio, chief photo analyst for MUFON. He pro- vided the author with a copy of these VHS clips and still frame photographs for comparison with the present pho- tographs. While they appear to be similar in shape to the present images they also differ in interesting ways. Figure 14 (not shown here) shows three consecutive 1/30 sec. video frames from a camcorder recording taken by Mr. John Stanolevich on August 23, 1995 at Rego Park (near Shea Stadium), New York, which were conclusively identified as an advertising blimp. These three video frames show: (A) the one-flash-per-second white, anti-collision strobe light on the bottom appearing Tlw Virgin Lightship Co. blimp as a bulge beneath the oval-shaped object. Each flash is seen in only one frame indicating that its duration is less than l/30th of a second. (B) and (C) the generally oval- shaped blimp image is composed of several horizontal (raster) TV lines separated by blank lines whose ends stair-step in order to produce the overall image. The overall width to length ratio of these images is 0.42 and no prominent dome is seen on the top. Contradictory film image size. If the object was one of the American Blimp Corporation airships (128 feet long) for instance, it would have had to be 21,395 feet (about 4 miles) away to produce the small image length found on these photographs! This large a distance con- tradicts the testimony of the main group of witnesses at the campsite, as well as that of two hunters who said they saw the object to the north of their estimated posi- tion. Other arguments. 1) the lack of any visible protuber- ance on the top of the blimp which is clearly visible in all of these photographs, 2) the presence of a small gondola below the blimp which is not visible on these photographs, 3) the presence of a dark, opaque (struc- tural) tip at each end of these blimps which is not seen in any of the eyewitness drawings or photographs, 4) the probable average velocity calculations presented below tend to exceed the maximum ground speed of a blimp. 5) the reported high acceleration departure exceeds the capability of blimps, 6) only one of the six witnesses at the main campground saw a flashing light on the object as it departed to the SE. However, FAA approved anti- collision strobe lights on flight certified blimps must be visible from all possible viewing positions relative to the blimp so that everyone in the group should have seen the strobe light.

No such sounds were heard by anyone. T he results presented in Table 6 (not shown) also support the opinion of Mr. J.K. wherein the angular size of a 128-foot-long blimp was calculated for each of four hypothetical viewing distances. The length of the image of the object on the original negative represents only 0.86 percent of the width of the frame which is con- siderably smaller than any of the values given in Table 6. Finally, the majority of blimps have a width to length ratio of from 0.25 to 0.30 which is approximately one- half of the ratio of the present aerial object (not includ- ing its dome on top). Discontinuous object motions. All but one of the main group of witnesses indicated that the object wasn't a blimp. It moved relatively fast, stopped, changed di- rections (appearing to approach the witnesses), stopped again, and then accelerated away in a matter of sec- onds. Blimps do not behave this way! Object velocity. Assuming certain values for total distance traveled (d) and sighting duration (t), object ve- locity can be calculated. Mr. J. K. thought the sighting lasted about 15 seconds while D. B. had a longer esti- mate of from 60 to 180 seconds. The other three primary witnesses (one of the six did not report) did not make temporal duration estimates. The total horizontal angle through which the object travelled (as measured from the main campsite) is approximately that shown in Figure I, although its distance from the observers is not known for sure. Assuming the flight path of the object was that shown by the heavy dashed line in Figure 1 and it was in sight for t = 60, 90. or 120 seconds, its average (constant) ve- locity is 65.3. 43.5, or 32.6 ft/sec.

Only the slowest of these values is within the 55 mph maximum speed of the commer- FEBRUARY 1996 NUMBER 334 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL cially produced Lightship Blimp discussed above. If the actual flight path of the object was far more of an acute angle V with its initial and final distances much greater than are shown in Figure 1. i.e.. an assumed to- tal flight path length of about 10.740 feet, with the near- est point as illustrated, the object's average velocity (also assuming a constant velocity) for t = 60, 90, or 120 seconds would be 262, 175, or 131 mph, respectively. All of these velocities are significantly faster than this blimp can fly. And so for a blimp, comparable to the Lightship Blimp, to have caused this report it would have had to do all of the following: I) fly at its maxi- mum speed and never stop moving, 2) fly along the approximate path shown in Figure 1 or nearer to the campsite, 3) remain in sight for about a hundred seconds or more (traveling at a constant speed), 4) somehow appear to accelerate at a high rate of speed, and 5) re- main silent the entire time! Since most of the witnesses said that the object moved discontinuously and actually seemed to stop once or twice, its actual velocity would have had to be even faster than calculated above to make up for the time it had stopped. Finally, no witness indicated that the object changed shape. If it were a blimp and changed heading, its length would seem to shorten somewhat without changing thickness. CONCLUSIONS The self-luminous aerial object seen and photographed at Mongo, Indiana on August 31, 1994, has remained unidentified after the various evaluations cited above. On the one hand, its overall shape and flight characteristics are not unlike many scores of other UFOs reported for more than fifty years from around the world, many of which were captured in photographs. On the other hand, a blimp definitely was seen during the night of August 31, 1994 in the Mongo area. The aerial object pho- tographed cannot be positively identified at this time. It remains a UFO. COMMENTS BY STATE DIRECTOR RIDGE We have been unable to obtain any official flight records for any blimp flights explaining the Mongo event. Two different blimp companies were \"identified\" (Family Channel & Virgin Lightship) by \"authorities.\" A current and separate investigation is underway involving a video taken the same evening at Hamilton, Indiana, just a few miles SE of Mongo! The witnesses also claim the object at one point was less than 100 feet over them, was as big as a football field, and made no noise! COMING ATTRACTIONS . . .

Do entities from another world really have sex organs of a type and func- tion likened to that of humans? If so, what might that suggest in terms of a common heritage? Alternately, do \"hybrid\" beings (somehow a mix of human and alien genes) possess human-like sexual features? The following synopsis, offered as a background briefing, derives from MUFON's Abduction Transcription Project (hereinafter the Project). This analysis of specific anatomical factors contained in 750 hypnosis and interview transcripts, involving 215 sepa- rate cases dating from the 1940s to the present, ad- dresses the question of whether or not the image in the purported 1947 film reflects reality as related by re- ported close encounter percipients. (See the February and March 1994 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal and the MUFON 1995 International UFO Symposium Proceedings for an overview of the Project and general findings.) HANDS, NOSES AND MOUTHS Among the Project's cases, involving over 2,000 de- scriptive factors indexed thus far, three characteristics stand out vis-a-vis the autopsied cadaver: • In no case was an entity or (human-alien) hybrid de- scribed as having six digits, as was apparent in the alleged autopsy film. Three and four digits were the norm; a few were attributed five. • Only three entities were said to have more than a vestigial nose: one a \"beak,\" the second a \"pointed\" nose, the third a \"projection.\" At least two of the three, then, would not seem to be a human nose as shown in the film. In the remainder of the 215 cases, entities were portrayed as having either an indistinct nose bridge or no nasal appendage whatsoever. Only one adult hybrid was reported to have a human- like nose. • No classical entity or even hybrid was ascribed full humanlike lips as seen in the Santilli film. Only a slit-like mouth was claimed in the overwhelming majority of cases. NAKED ENTITIES In 33 cases (15 percent of the Project's total), one or more entities appeared without clothing of any sort. A majority of those were of white-to-grey skin tone. Pale, greenish, blue or bluish-green, greyish-tan, and dark- skinned beings were likewise described. Most naked entities were said to be of short stature and part of the \"away team,\" restricted to delivery and return of the hu- man subject. However, the total included taller \"doctors\" and others in authority onboard. In none of the 33 relevant cases was such an entity noticed to have male or female genitals at the groin. FEMALES AND BREAST MASS Human-like mammary glands have been noted on one entity (of yellowish-grey skin tone) and one hybrid in the study. (As noted later in this paper, each proceeded to engage in sex with the human male subject.) By contrast, in 49 other cases (23 percent of the total), wherein at least one entity was assumed by the human subject to be female — by reason of softer facial fea- tures, specific mannerisms or other conclusion — none were characterized as displaying obvious breast mass. THE HYBRIDS So-called hybrid beings are, by all accounts, the byprod- ucts of alien reproductive intervention with human cap- tives. Accounting for about half of all cases in the Project, such reports typically relate the extraction of sperm from boys and men, as well as eggs from the ovaries of girls and women. Many of the latter cases de- scribe a later implantation of what was assumed to be an embryo of unknown parentage. Note: Precise numbers are not available, especially in terms of female subjects unsure whether a needle in- serted into the abdomen was to remove an egg from an ovary or that an embryo was what was vaginally im- planted. Regardless, the resultant offspring have seemingly been gestated, either from conception to birth or at least in the latter stages, in a \"test tube\" setting. This is at- tested to by numerous subjects shown rows of aquarium- like tanks, filled with liquid, in which partially formed fetuses were floating. Some men but more women recall being presented a newborn or older infant that, by appearances, was not entirely human. Most related that the child was his/hers with phrasings such as \"my baby,\" a \"product of me,\" or FEBRUARY 1996 NUMBER 334 PAGE 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"partly mine.\" But also, the child's oversized eyes, ex- tremely pale skin, frail structure or other features con- vinced the person that it was not from the joining of two humans. In 38 cases (18 percent of all cases in the study), human subjects have encountered one or more fully gestated hybrid newborns, older children or adults. A to- tal of 41 hybrids of various age categories were men- tioned (i.e., a few subjects observed hybrids of multiple age ranges). Borrowing colloquial terms to approxi- mate ages, they can be expressed as follows: • 24 infants (These included four referred to as boys, three called girls, 16 with no gender indicated, and one with an observed absence of genitals. In only one case did a transcript indicate that genitals were definitely viewed — a boy.) • Eight toddlers or pre-schoolers • Four of school age • Five adults In none of the latter three age types was the hybrid being's sex determined with confidence. Most were clothed throughout in some manner — from a simple nightgown worn by infants and young children to jump- suits or plain dresses by adults. Confusing the issue are not infrequent accounts wherein the man or woman described an infant, older child or even adult as human in every way. And, cer- tainly, it would appear easier to gestate children from hu- man sperm and ova than to somehow (a) combine either with its alien counterpart — if such even exists or (b) in- troduce an alien version of DNA into one or the other human component. RAPE VERSUS SEXUAL AROUSAL In ten cases the human subject claimed under hypnosis to have been raped, including physical penetration, by a nonhuman being: • Three females by human-sized, male entities of un- stated anatomical detail • Two females by human-sized, hairy/furry male be- ings • One female by a (6-foot or taller) \"Nordic\" male — her \"mate\" • One male by a tallish \"reptilian\" female of unstated skin tone or other detail • One male by a short, greyish-yellow-skinned fe- male (otherwise associated with grey-green reptil- ians) • One male by a pale-skinned, wispy-blonde-haired female with breasts, apparently a hybrid • One male by an undescribed female being A sexual element not involving forced intercourse was present in 15 additional cases. Phrasings by the Genitalia, therefore, have been attributed to entities and hybrids, but infrequently, and without anything remotely approaching absolute certainty on the subject's part. In this Project, that feature is restricted to the ten cases of reported rape, plus one case of an infant hybrid. human captives afterward to depict those moments in- cluded \"aroused,\" \"energy goes in,\" \"sensual,\" \"sexual feelings,\" \"coax me to feel sexual\" and \"climax.\" Various techniques were employed by entities to achieve that result, including close-up staring, a hand-held in- strument, an apparatus placed over male genitals and, more directly, \"claws in my crotch.\" In a few instances of non-penetrative sexual en- counter, the person 'specifically noticed a total absence of sex organs on the part of the entity eliciting the re- sponse. In fact, in no such incidents were same evident though, again, most of the beings responsible were clothed throughout. Note: These 15 cases involving the captive's sexual response are separate from eight other cases in which an apparatus was used to extract sperm from a male captive for apparent reproductive purposes — with no associated pleasurable feeling. Also excluded are dozens of cases in which female abductees reportedly endured the removal of ova. implantation of an embryo, or abortion of a par- tially gestated fetus. TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS Genitalia, therefore, have been attributed to entities and hybrids, but infrequently, and without anything remotely approaching absolute certainty on the subject's part. In this Project, that feature is restricted to the ten cases of reported rape, plus one case of an infant hybrid. Harkening back to the cadaver in the \"alien autopsy,\" one can argue the incongruity of an unearthly being with a vagina but neither a navel nor breast mass and nipples. If it was indeed a hybrid, the bald cranium does not mesh with typical reports of patchy or wispy hair generally associated with hybrid children and adults. A database of 215 separate cases, of course, cannot be claimed to represent abduction experiences in their en- tirety. Yet, given the repetition of descriptive factors so prominent in more recent transcripts, it does appear to cover most groups of entities allegedly operating with any regularity on this planet. In sum, the author would be greatly surprised if it were somehow proved that the individual in the film is other than the creation of someone, some group, or some government agency whose intention is to embarrass the UFO research community at a time when its accep- tance among the general populace has never been greater.

She was a bold, compassionate, and de- termined woman who reported events without softening the impact of her information. She wanted others to know the whole truth in every aspect as she discovered it for herself and through others. She worked as hard as anybody in the field, cranking out three intriguing books in quick succession: Into The Fringe, Taken and Masquerade of Angels. A number of my colleagues viewed her reports as \"dark, negative, or gloomy.\" In knowing Karla I did not feel that this was her wish or how she wanted the information to appear. She merely felt that she was reporting the truth as she discovered it — whatever that would be. She certainly did not al- ways like what she uncovered in her research. I view her work as an honest effort to provide us with information that may balance our views more realistically as we continue to seek understanding regarding these con- tacts with other beings. I sincerely hope that she has al- ready learned all the answers in the life beyond this one. We will miss you very much, Dr. Karla Turner! K arla and I shared one fascinating anomalous event in our years of knowing each other. Perhaps it is time to share this puzzling story. Karla had worked closely with hypnotherapist Barbara Bartholic in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She had always encouraged Barbara to at- tend UFO conferences whenever possible, but Barbara tended to shy away from such public conventions and stayed closer to home. A couple of days prior to the 1991 Eureka Springs, Arkansas UFO Conference hosted by Lou Parish, Barbara's son suddenly appeared and of- fered to fix her dishwasher, which had been broken for 4-5 years. In fact, she had used it as a pantry for storage for several years, having given up on its usefulness as a dishwasher. 1 had never met Barbara Bartholic, nor had I ever been to Tulsa. But as her son removed the chop- ping block cover from this dishwasher, which she had purchased at a garage sale about five years previously, he discovered one of my UFO business cards squarely in the center! My business cards had been printed at least two years after she had bought the dishwasher from the garage sale! Puzzled, they tried to see if the card could have been slid under this chopping block top once it was bolted back on. There was no way to get the card in there without taking this top off — which had never been removed either since she had bought it or since I had had the cards printed! Karla still had the only busi- ness card that she had ever gotten from me, and she was the only possible link to Barbara at all. Karla was ex- cited. Could this mean that Barbara was supposed to meet me at the Eureka Springs Conference for some un- known benefit or purpose? Apparently, Barbara was similarly impressed by the mystery of this event and did attend the conference just days later. We met and this card was returned to me—my never knowing how it could have travelled to Tulsa somehow and later become lodged between her broken dishwasher and its chopping block top. I remember staring at the card and getting an eerie feeling — like I should pay more attention to anomalous events like this: because it had now hap- pened to me without any logical or reasonable explana- tion whatsoever. I then shared a drawing of a Reptilian creature with Karla and Barbara, who were astounded. They said it was the closest match to the many descriptions they had received of Reptilian creatures in cases they had been working on. Perhaps this was an important moment for their research — we may never know. But I got my card back, and I still look at it occasionally and ponder the meaning of that peculiar incident. ALIEN AUTOPSY BODIES The controversy rages on with opposing views digging their trenches deeper. George Wingfield continues to try to narrow the field of possible hoaxers to three likely candidates from his detective efforts in England. Most researchers continue to believe that this is a clever fake with more holes in the story than Swiss Cheese. Abduction data, computer studies, and abductees them- selves have similarly rejected the televised images of the alleged alien autopsy. Clever photo analyses are going on with computers aiding the effort. It seems far from decided yet. Perhaps the real gain is that people are genuinely in- terested and willing to believe it is not a hoax — even if researchers are not convinced. Is that not a weird twist in the history of ufology? The public believes, while the UFO crowd doubts! The greatest benefit is that this will undoubtedly draw more people into the field of re- search. You can even rent the complete \"Alien Autopsy\" from Blockbuster Video now! Of course we always want the public to feast on the best and most scientifi- cally sound information. The whole debate over this film may just draw those hungry newcomers into the better areas of data anyway. And all of it intensifies the notion that the government is hiding something about UFOs from all of us. Whether or not this film is genuine, it could add to the growing pressure from the general population to force Congress or the President to have to respond in some fashion. The film has not yet been easily proven to be a fake, therefore the debate will hardly die soon.

The body in these three photos is much thin- ner, with longer arms, four very long finger/claws, no nose, a flatter face, and definitely more features akin to the \"standard\" little gray beings than the present autopsy film depicts. Researchers Yvonne Smith of Los Angeles, and Katharina Wilson of Portland, Oregon, viewed these new photos at the same time I did. We were all more impressed and intrigued with the new photos. Yet veteran researcher Ted Phillips, best known for his years of close contact with Dr. J. Allen Hynek and his work on physical ground traces worldwide, told me in January that Dr. Hynek had shown him alleged photos of a genuine alien body years ago. The head was much larger and the body much thinner. He states that neither the present au- topsy film, nor the new photos from the Orient, look at all like what he had seen during his research with Dr. Hynek. So prepare for a new debate — and more public in- terest! The biggest question of all is this: \"How will we know when we actually receive a real photo of an au- thentic alien being? What can we actually use to au- thenticate any image previously unknown to man?\" (I would be interested in your responses!) NEXT COLUMN: \"TELEPATHY VS.

David Spencer MUFON Deputy Director, Investigations LOG # 960103C, MA-1, 08/31/94. Investigator: Francis Ridge At significant personal costs of both money and time, Mr. Francis Ridge (State Director, Indiana) and Dr. Richard Haines spared no effort to assess the likeli- hood that this sighting was of an unidentifiable object. Mr. Ridge began the investigation early in October, 1994 and concluded his efforts at the end of September 1995. Only one month went by during the year in which he was not addressing aspects of the investigation. (See article elsewhere in this issue.) The viewing lasted less than 30 seconds from start to finish, but one witness had the presence of mind to use his automatic exposure camera and snap several pic- tures. Most of the investigation involved the photos and their negatives. At 2130 hours on August 31, 1994, at a hunter's campground in northern Indiana, six adults sitting around a fire observed an object brightly glowing through the treetops, like the moon. The object silently but quickly moved to an open area, where it was viewed as a self-illuminating, domed disc about 19 feet long and 8.5 feet thick. When it was about one-third of a mile away it appeared to begin hovering,.and the glow \"changed from a bright white to transparent.\" One wit- ness noticed a strobe light at the top just before the ob- ject faded and disappeared. It was discovered that four or more other persons had also observed the object's movement. Two, who were just entering the campgrounds, gave directional in- formation useful for a triangulation when combined with that from the camp fire witnesses. The viewing lasted less than 30 seconds from start to finish, but one witness had the presence of mind to use his automatic exposure camera and snap several pictures. Most of the investigation involved the photos and their negatives. As with most photos and videos of such objects, clear definition was not possible, and this fact compli- cated and delayed the analysis. It was finally concluded by Dr. Haines that the photos could not have been of an IFO. LOG # 951229cC, MA-1,12/77/94. Investigator: Ann Petmcelli Starting from their house at 1700 hours to drive to a small town in western Kentucky, a couple and their grown daughter saw a bright object \"hanging\" in the northeastern sky. They viewed it for over a minute be- fore it began moving southward toward them. As it ap- proached, the object appeared to be a large, white sphere having multiple red lights circling and bisecting it at an angle. The object turned eastward, and the family fol- lowed until it \"entered a thick cloud bank\" and disap- peared from view. At midnight, the daughter again saw the object. She attempted to follow in her car but lost it at a turn in the road. PAGE 14 NUMBER 334 Continued on Page 16 FEBRUARY 1996"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL AF HISTORIAN OFF-BASE Don Berliner T he interview of Air Force historian Bruce Ashcroft (\"Wright-Patterson AFB Historian Investigates Roswell Saucer Crash Story,\" November. 1995) gives a seriously distorted impression of the legitimacy of any suggested connection between Project Mogul and the Roswell crash. In fact, it reads a lot like government pro- paganda. Suggesting that wreckage from a Mogul balloon train or cluster may have been responsible for the Roswell crash is simply preposterous, and counter to all the evi- dence, and to logic. To those of us who have been in the UFO field for a long time, it reads for all the world like the nonsense once spread by the Air Force's Project Blue Book. The following is therefore offered in rebuttal to the claim: 1. The Air Force has never said that a Project Mogul balloon assembly was responsible for the Roswell wreckage, only that this may have been the case. 2. No evidence has been produced to support the claim that any Mogul wreckage landed on the Foster Ranch, only that it could have. There are no documents offered to support the contention that any balloon was found there. The suggestion that test flight #4 landed on the sheep ranch is pure, unsupported theory. This early test flight was not tracked, as tracking data was not considered of importance. The balloons could have flown off in any direction, and landed anywhere. Claiming they landed on what has become known as the \"debris field\" is no more than wishful thinking on the part of the Air Force propagandists and their supporters. 3. Even if test flight #4 landed on the Foster Ranch, it could not have accounted for the materials found there by USAAF Intelligence Officer Maj. Jesse Marcel, and handled by his precocious 11-year-old son. They de- scribed materials of unusually light weight and unusually great strength, characteristics never known for balloon materials. One of the Air Force's main sources of information, Prof. Charles Moore, makes it clear that the off-the- shelf neoprene weather balloons used in the early test flights rapidly disintegrated in the bright sunlight to \"dark brown or grey flakes or ashes.\" This means the winds would have made sure there was nothing left of the balloons which would have borne any similarity to what the Marcels described finding. Or would even have been noticed by ranch foreman \"Mac\" Brazel or anyone else. All that would have been left would have been the re- mains of several radar reflectors made from l/4\"xl/4\" glue-covered balsawood sticks and some metalized pa- per. No one in his right mind could have described these as unusually light and unusually strong. Nor would the younger Marcel have looked at the flowered tape the Air Force says was used to reinforce the radar reflectors, and then described it as mysterious embossed symbols on the web of I-beams, unless that is what it was. Again, the Air Force claimed he saw flowered tape, but produced nothing to support the claim: not a single photo of tape that allegedly was a commercial product. 4. The Air force insists that the security of the highly classified Project Mogul explains the great concern for secrecy described by many witnesses. But other Mogul balloon test rigs landed elsewhere, and there is no sign of any special security precautions. Flight #6 landed south of the Alamogordo launch site, and was found by a rancher who called Alamogordo as instructed to do by the tag which Prof. Moore said was attached to all launched devices. This resulted in a crew being sent to recover the remains. No ring of guards around the area, no secrecy of any sort. Either Project Mogul was so secret it had to be protected with great care, or it wasn't. You can't have it both ways. 5. Maj. Marcel described the debris field as 2/3 of a mile long and several hundred yards wide which was lit- tered with scrap material, all of it unfamiliar. Could a veteran intelligence officer possibly have described the remains of a bunch of weather balloons and radar re- flectors in this way? There would have been little or nothing visible of the deteriorated balloons, which leaves only the reflectors. But they would have still been at- tached to the braided line on which they had been hoisted aloft in the first place. And so they would have covered precious little of the 50 or more acres esti- mated by Maj. Marcel. And he would certainly have mentioned their being connected to a common line. 6. Much of the 1,000-page USAF Project Mogul Report published in September, 1995, consists of schematic diagrams of radio receivers and installation drawings for valves and other apparatus used on Project Mogul test flights. Yet no one has ever described finding anything remotely similar at the crash. Not a piece of mechanism of any sort, mechanical, electrical, or elec- tronic. Why was this material included if it couldn't answer any questions? 7. Even more obviously irrelevant was the inclusion of more than 100 pages of data on Project Mogul test FEBRUARY 1996 NUMBER 334 PAGE I 5"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL flights which occurred long after the debris was found. What does this explain? Can a fumble in the third quar- ter explain a touchdown in the first quarter? 8. Why does the report treat other possible explanations in such an unbalanced way? In a single page it disposes of the possibilities that the wreckage could have had anything to do with the crash of a military airplane, the impact of a test missile or rocket, and any kind of nuclear accident. Hundreds of pages of supporting documents and testimony are offered for the Project Mogul explana- tion, but not a single document to support any of the oth- er contentions. There are references to the availability of documents, but none is reproduced or even quoted. In the case of five military planes which crashed in New Mexico, the period covered is June 24 through July 28, the latter date being almost three weeks after the debris was found! A minor example of poor research is the claim that one of the crashed airplanes was a P- 5 IN Mustang fighter, when a check of any of a hundred sources would have revealed that no such version of the famous fighter ever existed. 9. The cover of the huge report is an impressive painting of a brilliant white \"something\" streaking down from the pre-dawn or post-dusk sky toward a desert populated by a cactus and a cowboy on horseback. This obviously is not a balloon or a cluster of balloons, as bal- loons do not appear brilliant against a dark sky, nor are they capable of streaking anywhere, under any condi- tions. It looks like something completely unrelated to Project Mogul. And if it couldn't have been an airplane or a rocket or a missile, what could it be? You don't suppose it might be a . . .? Could the Air Force be trying in an uncharacteristically subtle way to express something it doesn't want to come right out and say?

Investigator: Beverly Trout The moon was still below the horizon in northwestern Iowa on August 30, 1995, and Nathan, who was later joined by his sister, was outside his house taking ad- vantage of the moonless sky to stargaze. For over an hour beginning at 2300 hours, the two watched multiple unusual objects —other than meteors — fly across the sky. The objects appeared to be twice the size of a full moon and \"very high.\" Each sighting lasted only a few seconds, but there were many (11-20) different sightings made during the period. A few objects were blurry and shapeless, even when viewed through binoculars. Most were translucent, isosceles (not equilateral) triangles that were wider at the back end than the sides. There was a light at each apex. Their surfaces looked like refractive heat waves that did not block the stars. Lastly, six or seven red lights swept by very quickly, four of them seeming to weave around each other. The witnesses \"had seen enough\" and went into their house.

Ft wasn't a UFO conference per se, but over granola in his case and ham and eggs in mine, the talk soon turned to that subject. To my surprise, he reached into his brief- case and pulled out a small portfolio of UFO pho- tographs — the clearest I had ever seen. The pho- tographs were taken by one Eduard \"Billy\" Meier; the scientist had purchased them on a personal visit to Meier's headquarters (now known as the Semjase Silver Star Center) near the small village of Wetzikon, Switzerland. My gut reaction — in which I was hardly alone at the time — was that the pictures were simply too good to be true. In general, UFO photographs are a haphazard busi- ness at best, one reason why they remain so controver- sial. But part of the early Meier mystique was not only the quality of pictures involved, but their sheer quantity. Visitors to the Semjase Silver Star Center, named after an alleged female saucer pilot from the Pleiades, can now pick and choose among (and pay for) over 1000 \"UFO\" photographs taken by a one-armed farmer with a reportedly defective 35mm camera. Many of the pic- tures were so good that they appeared posed, which, in- deed, is just what Meier and his followers would even- tually claim, particularly for an impressive series of photographs taken at nearby Fuchsbuel on July 9, 1975. Reportedly, at Meier's request for the definitive UFO photograph, Semjase flew her Pleiadian \"beamship\" around a large tree overlooking Lake Pfaffikon. When researchers later noted that the tree had mysteriously dis- appeared from view, it was patiently explained that it had been sent back in time because of radioactive cont- amination! My scientist friend wasn't the only one who swal- lowed this story without so much as a single antacid — or attempt at corroboration. Two glossy, coffeetable- sized collections of the Meier photographs by Tucson- based Genesis III Productions quickly became high- priced collector's items among the UFO community.

Over the years, I corresponded with the scientist and again bumped into him on occasion. Each time 1 ex- pected him to recant, or at least pull back slightly from his public support of the Meier \"mystery\" in the interest of science, but his belief only grew stronger. The last time I saw him he was working on an English translation of the Talmud Immanuel.

The answer, as far as my scientist friend is concerned, is probably purely a personal one, involv- ing something akin to religious faith. Yet he was hard- ly alone in his acceptance. Another part of the answer, as made painfully clear in Kal Korff's stunning expose of the Meier cult, Spaceships of the Pleiades: The Billy Meier Story, is that ufologists must share at least some of the blame — if for no other reason than that of not demanding enough of ourselves and our field of study. By not policing ourselves, by not requiring airtight evidence and critical thinking, we leave ufology (and the public perception of same) wide open to pseudoscience, rumor and tabloid innu- endo of every sort and stripe. Of which the Roswell \"alien\" autopsy film is but likely the most recent, if hardly the last, example. Everyone's pockets are enriched by the process but ours. T his is not to say that mainstream ufology as a whole ever accepted or promoted Meier's pho- tographs and his other claims of so-called evidence, but certainly some fringe figures who style themselves ufologists did, and it is unfortunately with the same tar that we are all ultimately feathered. Spaceships of the Pleiades was delayed several times while in press, and it's my personal suspicion that the delays were proba- bly due to the publisher's legal department, for author Korff certainly doesn't treat his subjects with silk gloves. Dissemblers are called dissemblers, sloppy (or no) investigation is so named, and so on. (In an increasingly familiar and disturbing trend, falsely claimed college degrees are the least of sins revealed here.) Duplicity and incompetence everywhere abound. In short, the whole sordid story of Meier and his many misguided supporters is laid out in often excruciating detail for the reader to see and judge for him or herself. If anyone's reputation has been injured thereby, more often than not that damage has been wholly self-inflicted. At 439 pages, Spaceships of the Pleiades is a big bruising book — it's also a long overdue and neces- sary one. The year is young yet, but if you care about the field and buy and read only one book this year, you could do considerably worse. Don't be put off by the fact that Prometheus Books, a sort of CSICOP clearing house for long, self-referencing manuscripts, is the publisher. Korff isn't out to demolish or debunk ufology so much as to improve it. Whether from with- in or without, however, probably remains to be seen. Since when do exposes, for example, ever sell as well as the original pose?

TX 78212); ISBN 1076-4208 Reviewed by Jerome Clark T he third issue of The Anomalist (dated Winter 1995- 96) makes a welcome appearance, proving once more — fashionable cranky pessimism notwithstanding — that this is the Golden Age of UFO/Fortean literature. As someone who spends many of his waking hours reading the literature of earlier decades, I ought to know. Sure, there's plenty of junk around. There'll always be plenty of junk around. So what? History will judge us by the best, not the worst, of what we managed to accom- plish, and these days we anomalists are accomplishing two refereed Journals (of UFO Studies and of Scientific Exploration), the magnificent Fortean Studies (edited by Steve Moore and published by Fortean Times), and Huyghe/Stacy's cheeky, entertaining Anomalist. Perish PAGE 18 NUMBER 334 FEBRUARY 1996"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL the thought, but could it be that we are actually growing up? The Anomalist boasts a distinctive character which renders it unlike any other Fortean periodical I have seen. It is certainly not a formal scientific journal, though each issue carries a paper or two or three that could fairly be called formal and scientific; it is indisputably well-written and -edited and smart, unpredictable enough to give a forum to everybody from professional disbe- liever Robert A. Baker (#2) to Donna Higbee who in the new issue reports on something even I, who usually think I have heard everything (and am invariably wrong), had not encountered heretofore: \"Involuntary Spontaneous Human Invisibility.\" Huh? you ejaculate. Well, hold on. According to Higbee: \"My research has shown the people who have expe- rienced this to be well adjusted, well educated and taken totally by surprise at the occurrence of invisibility. Often it takes several such occurrences before they realize that they are truly invisible during certain times to other people. They attempt to interact with those around them and simply can't be seen or heard. This produces frus- tration and, in many cases, a sense of fear at something which they don't understand.\" I should think so. I have experienced involuntary in- visibility more than once. Always, for some reason, in restaurants. Okay, dumb joke. Seriously: the experiences of hu- mans can be ragged, confusing, and sometimes passing strange, and I respect Huyghe and Stacy for opening up their journal to stuff such as this, for precisely the same reason I admired my late friend D. Scott Rogo's will- ingness to listen to persons who claimed to have re- ceived phone calls from the dead. Perhaps human events, various and multitudinous though they be, are fi- nally finite, but human experiences seem numberless. More conservatively, Huyghe contributes a pointed short essay on how science receives extraordinary claims which seem to have met the measure of proof the skep- tics demanded at the initiation of play. The poor claimant/sap who believes he has abided by the rules suddenly finds that the rules have been rewritten. Huyghe observes, \"This practice, often referred to as 'Moving the Goal Posts,' is an extraordinary phenome- non in itself and deserves recognition...Extraordinary proof often seems to mean...a change in the standards of proof... All of which gives a truly extraordinary meaning to the phrase 'extraordinary proof.'\" Huyghe could also have noted that Marcello Truzzi, who coined the often quoted (and often abused) maxim about extraordinary claims and extraordinary proof, did not mean that only proponents are answerable for their propositions. He remarks that \"the rules of scientific method demand that those who shift from merely ex- pressing doubt to outrightly expressing denial must bear a burden of proof for their negative claims just as do proponents for positive claims.\" If Truzzi's admonition were followed, of course, it would be curtains for many extraordinary debunking claims. S peaking of which: In \"UFO Flaps\" skeptic Martin Kottmeyer makes some fairly incredible ones him- self, for example that the famous summer 1952 wave was a sort of hysterical response to a steel strike. As a matter of style and principle, I use exclamation points al- most never, but you will have to excuse my inability to resist italics. Kottmeyer commits the usual errors of the psychosocial theorist, namely the dubious cause-and-ef- fect relationships and unfalsifiable hypotheses without which this particular school of ufological guesswork would have little claim on our attention. Eddie Bullard, much the better scholar of the wave phenomenon, is nowhere cited. To be fair, however. Kottmeyer's piece is two-thirds of a fine piece of work. Rare for psychosocial writing, which is not much inclined to fret over its own obvious shortcomings, it effectively critiques the failings of ear- lier wave theories (not excluding it's-all-in-the-psyche- or-in-the society speculations) before the inevitable let- down, when Kottmeyer unloads his own theory, which turns out to be no less flawed than those he has just skewered. Still, if he is often unconvincing, he is usually interesting. Few if any ufologists know more about Space Age pop culture than Kottmeyer does. Unfortunately, as a UFO theorist, Kottmeyer is an en- gaging and imaginative historian of entertainment-in- dustry ephemera. Hilary Evans, Britain's best-known psychosocial the- orist, addresses, more successfully than one suspects Kottmeyer would if he took up psychical research, the intriguing question of why ghosts wear clothes. In his analysis Evans adroitly avoids the reductionist traps. Perhaps the most interesting revelation here is that there are some, albeit rare, reports of unclad apparitions. Evans writes with humor and insight. It's this sort of es- say, literate, intelligent, unexpected, and good-natured, that gives Anomalist its particular charm. The other psychical-research paper is by Michael Grosso, whose notions about Mind at Large, expressed here and in his own books (and in Kenneth Ring's Omega Project [1992]), fail to persuade me but do awe me with their ingenuity. \"The Anomalies of Death\" is a thoroughly enchanting mental exercise even for unbe- lievers like the undersigned. Besides, one can only be grateful to the creator of a sentence and concept such as this: \"Humans are metaphysical amphibians who si- multaneously inhabit physical and mental dimensions.\" Cryptozoology, my favorite anomalous pursuit after ufology, is covered in a splendid 33-page paper by Gary S.

Casteel reports that attorneys employed by the Mormon Church asked investigator Felber \"to discontinue his relationship with the Hesses,\" and that church officials advised the Hesses to disregard Felber's book as \"the work of Satan.\" The ufological world tends to assume that cover-ups and conspiracies express themselves as polarities: the government against the people, investigators against the military, or abductees against unbelieving friends and relatives. In the standard UFO narrative, helpful insti- tutions such as charities, foundations, institutions, churches, and mental health facilities eventually fall into the \"good\" category. The paradigmatic case is that of the public-interest journalist, municipal police de- tective, or university psychologist who is initially skep- tical about a UFO event but who, after independent in- quiry or service as a counselor, comes to believe the story and to help the experiencer involved overcome as- sorted obstacles, from stonewalling government offi- cials to peer pressure. In this Utopian narrative, the \"helping\" professions and institutions play a helpful or at least benign role; often, they even provide research funding. Felber's case, however, is at least the second one this year in which a major philanthropic, religious, or public-interest organization has aggressively ob- structed ufological research. The other case is that of psychiatrist John Mack, who faced sanctions and ha- rassment from America's premiere research university as a result of his unorthodox inquiries. At the least, the Felber case warns ufologists to be cautious about stereotyping or caricaturing the players and the stories in the theatre of ufology. Because no one knows who is who in the UFO mystery, researchers should not assume that public-interest organizations are public-spirited when it comes to this highly controversial issue. A story like Felber's could stimulate a number of initiatives. First, it suggests that MUFON should con- tinue its efforts to increase public awareness of \"legiti- mate\" UFO counseling so that puzzled experiences like the Hesses can find proper assistance. Second, it suggests that MUFON might want to look into the ques- tion of malpractice in the caregiving community, with special attention to those providers (priests, psychia- trists, academic professionals) who refuse to consider ab- duction in their diagnoses—who therefore, however in- advertently, are mistreating their patients and subjects. A legal initiative to compel the recognition of abduction-re- lated stress as an insurance-reimbursed diagnosis would go a long way toward making UFOs a real-life problem rather than an eccentric diversion. Third, the Hess- Felber saga indicates that inquiries are needed into the non-benevolent activities of benevolent institutions (for example, questions should be raised when a major uni- versity with government and military contracts cracks down on a researcher who takes up ufological topics). Fourth, it encourages further research into the cross- cultural, ideological dimensions of the UFO phenome- non (for example, anthropological inquiries into the re- sistance or openness within different types of cultures and institutions to ideas about the paranormal). And, fifth, the Felber case stimulates further work in the study of UFO-related secrecy as not simply secrecy per se, but as a rhetoric of censorship and even institutional vigilantism. —Kevin L.

I was par- ticularly interested in the article \"Analyzing UFO Waves\" by Joseph Ritrovato. He should have been made aware of the study done by David Saunders and (I be- lieve) Mark Rodeghier, and published in the Proceedings of the 1976 CUFOS Conference. It covered all the coun- tries then providing information on UFO sightings and offered some good data to predict where and when the next flap would occur. Well, my conclusion has been that with this phenomenon, once you identify a pattern, the pattern changes. In my 52 years (since 1943) of do- ing investigation and research on UFO sighting reports, this is the only pattern which has remained consistent. If this has been addressed in subsequent issues, for- give my late entry. Sub-zero temperatures and four feet of snow on the ground, at my age, mean time to catch up on my reading! —Joan L.

Granson, M.A. (Pensacola, FL) was re- cently appointed Florida Chief Investigator by Charles D. Flannigan, State Director. MUFON NATIONAL UFO HOTLINE MUFON has been introducing its National UFO Hotline 1-800-UFO-.2I66 or 1-800-836-2166 to the public. Designed to obtain UFO sighting reports from police agencies nationwide, we are now prepared to expand its coverage. All State Directors were advised by a letter nearly a year ago to utilize this number for filing hot UFO cases that came to their attention. A letter an- nouncing the 800 number was mailed to all sheriff's of- fices and police chiefs in Texas last spring as a means of testing and evaluating the effectiveness of the system. The majority of our calls, to-date, have been from people who called the 800 directory and asked for \"UFO\" to report sightings or to seek UFO information. To send letters to every police department and sher- iff's office throughout the U.S.A. would obviously be both expensive and time-consuming. We would like for every State Director, State Section Director, Field Investigator, and Field Investigator Trainee to notify your local sheriff, police chief, and state highway patrol office of MUFON's 800 number via a postcard that they may post on their bulletin boards or at the dis- patcher's desk. Presently, we are attempting to answer all calls \"live.\" An answering box records the calls received late at night or early mornings. These sighting reports will be mailed or telephoned to the nearest State Section Director, State Director, or Field Investigator for a per- sonal interview. Brief replies to these cases under in- vestigation may be made to MUFON on the 800 num- ber. (The answering box is limited to three minutes.) However, this number is not to be used for other MU- FON communications. The MUFON business office number is (210) 379-9216. Please advise Walt Andrus by postcard or letter to which agencies you filed the UFO hotline number 1-800-UFO-2166. Your help is sincerely appreciated. WALL CLOCKS MUFON recently purchased thirty quartz wall clocks (battery operated) for sale in the UFO Information Center. The black wall clocks have a white face with black numerals and the MUFON logo and name promi- nently displayed on the front. The clocks are eleven inches in diameter and are very fitting for any appro- priate room in your home, your UFO study and library, or your business. The clocks are being sold for $20 at the Center, but are also available by mail for an addi- tional $3.50 for shipping and handling. SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS COVER DESIGN CONTEST The theme for the MUFON 1996 International UFO Symposium is \"UFOLOGY: A Scientific Enigma.\" We endeavor to depict this theme in the cover artwork. Obviously, this requires considerable ingenuity and something unique in design. The 8 1/2\" x 11\" size will be printed in black on a light pastel color leatherette stock. Since small and intricate details do not print well on a leatherette stock, please take this into consideration in your design. The winning design may also be used on the symposium program in Greensboro, NC. The dead- line for submission is April 15, 1996. The winner will receive an honorarium of $100 cash plus $100 worth of MUFON publications of your choice. Good luck FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAMS Anyone who has purchased and studied the 4th edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eligible to take the exam via mail when they feel they are ready. The 100-question test may be secured from MUFON headquarters in Seguin and returned to this office for grading. In localities where field investigator training classes are being conducted, the instructor may order sufficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the completion of the training classes. For current members, the new manual may be purchased for $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling from MUFON in Seguin. MUFON MOTTO CONTEST Believe it or not, MUFON is now in its twenty-sev- enth year and does not have a motto describing our goals and purpose. Yes, we are endeavoring to resolve the UFO phenomenon in a scientific manner, but we need a serious and \"catchy\" motto to use in the Journal, stationery, symposium programs, etc. It should be short, but yet very meaningful, such as \"Scientific Resolution of the UFO Phenomenon.\" A prize of $100 in MUFON publications will be awarded to the winner. The deadline for submission of your motto is June 1, 1996. Put on your \"thinking-cap\" and come up with a unique and exciting motto for MUFON. (MUFON could also be used in the motto if this would make it more attrac- tive.) EDWARD J. ZELLER Wesley Ellison advised MUFON of the passing of Edward J. Zeller, Ph.D., a Consultant in Geology and a faculty member at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. Dr. Zeller was very interested in UFO landing site effects and their implications.
