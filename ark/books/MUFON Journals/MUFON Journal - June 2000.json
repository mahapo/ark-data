The most unusual character- istic is what appears to be er- ratic motion; although the ob- ject size is unknown, conserva- tive estimates of the object size result in object accelerations that are not feasible with !«•«•• • known technology, and would JeM Sami ° probably destroy any known aircraft. Like most videos, the cameras are zoomed, leav- ing out terrestrial objects that would be used as refer- ence points to determine UFO motion. Fortunately, the cameras were able to see background stars, mak- ing the measurement of UFO motion possible. The July 22 sighting On the evening of July 22, 1999, over the Israeli \"Special\" (nuclear?) Air Force Base at Palmachim-Yavne (S. of Tel Aviv), an object was re- ported to fly from the north to the coastal area where it stopped and hovered above the base. No noise was reported in the six hours the object hovered. More than 100 witnesses reportedly saw the object; several are seen on the video submitted. Planes were reported circling the object at a distance, although none appear on video. The video was about 12 minutes long; the tape has gaps, and with no onscreen time the actual duration cov- ered is unknown. Generally, the video shows the cam- era zooming into the object, giving extreme magnifica- tion. The camera is capable of digital zoom, which mostly provides magnification and.artifacts, but no true detail. When normal hand-holding jiggle causes the object to be lost, the camera is fully dezoomed, the object re-located, and zooming re-attempted. This allows in- termittent views of the object position in the sky (com- pared with streetlight positions), alternated with views of the object shape. The composite image Fig. 1 shows the object position at the noted time in seconds from the beginning of the video. Note the non-linear path of the object. Also note that the object moves a considerable angular distance in about a minute. (A witness face is obscured for privacy.) In close zooms, the object shows a wide variety of shapes. The composite Fig. 2 shows some of those seen. None of these images are \"one-frame^wonders;\" all shapes shown are visible in numerous frames, and are therefore not merely due to random tape noise or other intermittent artifacts. Equally important is to recognize"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 June 2000 MUFON UFO Journal what is NOT \"seen\" (video ar- tifacts as opposed to real im- ages). The horizontal and verti- cal lines are camera artifacts of digital zoom and interlace, and should not be taken as actual structure of the object. Relative brightnesses of light are valid data, taking overexposure into account. The actual colors of small ob- jects are not properly recorded onto videotape, due to video bandwidth limitations. A bright overexposed object appears white, regardless of actual color. A large blob should not be taken as a true size, since this usually indicates imperfect focus of the camera. A bright area around a white light, fading with distance from center, is probably glare. As the glare is often not overexposed and is over a large area, its color is indicative of the actual object's color, even if overex- posed. Most camcorders will detect near infrared, in the range of 700-lOOOnM (nanometers wavelength). For reference, the human eye sees violet near 400nM, up to red near 700nM. Silicon photodetectors, the usual heart of a camcorder video signal, typically have peak response around TOOnM, near infrared. A camcorder in- frared response can be tested by looking at a TV remote control through the camera while push- ing buttons on the remote. In- frared response will be seen as white flashes in the camera that can't be seen by eye. Infrared in a video can be dis- tinguished in three ways: It will be seen though the camera, but not by the naked eye (if excited witnesses take care to note!); it appears white; and being a longer wavelength, will focus differently. \"Near infrared\" Figure 2 Figure 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2000 PageS should be distinguished from \"thermal infrared,\" which is a far longer wavelength not detectable by ordinary camcorders, but often used in night-vision equipment. For a typical achromatic lens, infrared underfocuses; it is bent less, so the lens-image distance must be greater than for visible light. The result can be a ring-shape, distinct from properly-focused visible- light images in the same scene. Note the object typically shows two or three lights, sometimes with one or two dimmer lights. The bright/ dim distinction changes; in one segment, an equilateral-triangle arrangement slowly turns counter- clockwise and flattens, with the lower-left light dim- ming until the object resembles a pair of lights with a dimmer light between. It should be noted that the char- acteristic flash of airplane anti-collision strobe lights are never seen in the video. Misfocused point of light Note in the 5th image down in Fig. 2, the appear- ance of a \"headphones\" shape. The \"headstrap\" bridg- ing the \"earphones\" is not a segment of a circle, indi- cating merely a misfocussed point of light. The aspect ratio (height/width ratio) is about 1.5/1, clearly differ- ent than a circle. During the headstrap's visibility, oc- casional twinkles are seen within it; it appears to be a real object, not an artifact. The 6th-8th images in Fig. 2 show a ring of light. Particularly in the 8th frame, the \"earphones\" are in fairly good focus, but the ring is quite evident. This would be consistent with a strong infrared source, pro- ducing an under-focussed ring image, while visible wavelengths are in proper focus. The images in Fig. 3, the result of digital zoom, are useful with the repeated caveat that the vertical pat- tern is from digital zoom, not a real attribute of the object. The uppermost frame shows the right light ex- tremely overexposed, showing an orange result in the non-overexposed glare. This orange result should be interpreted with caution-even the best cameras pro- duce poor color at night. Note in your local nightly weather forecast, live cam- era shots of city interstate intersections may be shown for gauging traffic or weather. The picture will appear quite red, although any driver knows the scene is yellowish-white. This is due to the sodium-yellow lights' wavelength registering on the red channel of the camera. The true color could be yellower than what is seen on the video. The important aspect of this image is that the object has an extremely bright yellow/orange light, with two much weaker white lights. This combi- nation is inconsistent with typical aircraft lighting; extremely bright lights are typically landing lights, which are white. The last three images in Fig. 3 show closeups of a three-light arrangement, with the lower two lights in fairly sharp focus (although much glare) but the upper light in very bad focus. The difference between glare and focus is obvious; the lower circles have a clear source in the bright centers, but the upper ring has little or no distinguishing center. This verifies the upper ring is the result of poor fo- cus of that wavelength, not glare. As the other points are in fairly good focus, the misfocus is apparently due to a wavelength difference between the lower lights and the upper. Infrared light appears to be the only can- didate which would cause this result-ultraviolet light penetrates glass poorly and registers on silicon photo- receptors poorly. At several points in closeups in the video, persistent points of light (as opposed to random spots of video noise) appear in the same, or at least in predictably different, positions on the screen. This is consistent with a background star (example in cover illustration, circled) appearing in the video, appearing to bounce around due to the unsteadiness of the videographer's hand. (I could not find a weather report verifying clear skies that night. Another source of light, such as a plane running light, gives little change in the conclusions so based.) Such a reference star is very useful in that it can be used to determine the true angular motion of the ob- ject, as long as the object is far enough away that posi- tional movement of the camera generates no signifi- cant parallax error. True angular motion Given the numerous witnesses referring to a distant object, and the degree of zoom making any significant lateral movement of the camera difficult while main- taining aim, the possibility of parallax seems doubtful for giving a significant apparent shift between the star and the object. The results shown below, therefore, appear to be true angular motion of the object rather than the result of artifacts. Shown graphically in Fig. 4 is the X-difference (solid line with square markers, in units of screen pixels on a 640-by-480 display) and Y-difference (thick line) be- tween the object and the star over a 145-frame time period (almost five seconds). As a size reference, the object is about 40 pixels wide center-to-center of its outermost lights. The X-difference between the star and the camera aim is shown as a dotted line with triangle markers. The star is often not clearly visible, being smeared out by camera motion to obscurity or simply off-screen. Such points are unmarked on the graph. Note the ob- ject made five reversals in direction in these five sec- onds; an astonishing performance. The maximum lat-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 June 2000 MUFON UFO Journal -150 -200 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Figure 4 eral motion is about six times the apparent width of the object. Assuming (as a probably conservative guess; see below) that the object is 10 feet across, the object went 60 feet back and forth in about 1 second. The maxi- mum acceleration is about 18G. This is consistent his- torically with witness reports in which erratic UFO flight is reported, and quite uncharacteristic with known aircraft performance. The reference star does not ap- pear to be a lens flare from any of the numerous streetlights in the area (or of the object itself). Several lens flares ARE obvious during low-zoom conditions. A valid reference point If a lens flare, it would have the shape (perhaps re- flected and/or inverted) of the source light; instead the star is small and pointlike. But assuming the object to be motionless, and that the apparent motion is totally camera motion, the \"star\" motion should correlate to the camera motion. This is since a lens flare is merely a reflection off some stray surface inside the lens, and moving the \"mirror\" (lens/camera) will also move the reflection accordingly. But no such correlation is found. All indications are that the star is a distant pointlike object, and a valid reference point. The graph in Fig. 5 shows another segment of the video where a star appeared useful as a reference point, with the same symbology as the previous graph. Simi- larly, about 8 reversals are seen in about a seven-second period. The object width is about 60 pixels, so the ob- ject moved laterally about six times its own width back and forth. Near the end of the segment, extreme mo- tion of the camera smeared out the star image beyond recognizability, so this portion of the graph is blank. Camera motion can be useful Extreme motion of the camera can be useful. The image in Fig. 6 shows a streak generated, presumably when the camera was bumped; the previous frames are also disturbed as if bumped. The streak shows a time-exposure of the object during the 1/50 second exposure of a single field. The brightness of the streak is representative of the brightness times the duration the light spent at a particular point on the image. Since the motion of the camera isn't known, the time duration during the streak is not known. However, since there are two lights, IF the lights are of constant bright- ness, one would expect the brightnesses of the two streaks to correspond: a bright region of one light's streak would correspond to a bright region of the other. This effect is not seen; corresponding parts of the two streaks are obviously of different brightness. The differing brightnesses could be explained by several phenomenon, all resulting in an anomalous conclusion:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2000 Page? 200 100 0 -100 -200 -300 0 50 100 150 200 Figure 5 1. The lights are rapidly changing brightness. Stan- dard tungsten aircraft lights are incapable of doing this. 2. Atmospheric turbulence (twinkling) is causing the brightness changes. This implies a considerable amount of air between the object and camera; the amount de- pends on distance and the air stability. A hot night will have more thermal action than a cold still night. (A large amount of heat roiling off the object, such as looking directly into a jet exhaust, will also cause turbulence.) Assuming no object heat, I would guess at least several kilometers of air between the object and camera to gen- erate this amount of twinkling. Conservatively assum- ing one kilometer distance, and 100X digital zoom (which is a guess, but typical) and a pair of lights 1/3 of the frame-width, the light spacing is 1000 meters /I OOX zoom * 1/3, or about 3 meters apart. Often, three or more lights at similar spacings are seen, so the object size is at least twice this size. In both graphs, the camera motion clearly lags the object motion by about 1/3 second. This is what would be expected of a videographer trying to \"track\" an er- ratically moving object. The 1/3 second delay is what would be expected from studies of computer mouse and trackball human re- sponse testing, and also is on the slow end of a TV cameraman's performance in tracking the football dur- ing unexpected events (intercepts, fumbles, fake handoffs, etc.) during NFL play. So the camera mo- tion is quite typical of what would be expected from normal human hand-eye coordination.

Summary of the object's characteristics: 1. No standard aircraft anticollision strobes are ever seen. 2. The object path is atypical for a plane. A helicop- ter could make such a path, although hovering silently for six hours is a gas-guzzling challenge. 3. The arrangement of lights changes continuously, often assuming a non-horizontal arrangement. Air- planes, unless viewed from substantially below, appear as inherently horizontal objects. 4. A \"headstrap\" structure is seen which appears to be real, and does not match any lighted airplane or he- licopter structure I am familiar with. 5. At one point, the object's brightest light, by far, is approximately orange (perhaps yellow or red). An ex- tremely bright light of this color is not standard on any airplane I am familiar with. 6. At another point, the object appears to have a light source that emits infrared (approximately 900nM) with little or no corresponding visible light. 7. The object position, compared to reference stars, is erratic. Although the object size is unknown, even conservative size estimates yield astonishing accelera- tion results. The first six characteristics might be achieved with a determined faker with an incredible helicopter and a complex array of visible and infrared lights, but the last characteristic is implausible for any known aircraft. The September 2 sighting On the evening of Sept. 2, 1998, a 14-minute vid- eotape was recorded showing a similar strange triangle of lights, described as red/yellow/blue, \"patrolling the skies of Rishon Leziyon\" (sometimes translated as Le Zion or Letzion) on coastal Israel. The camcorder is obviously handheld, with the usual shakiness of a handhold with zoom. The zoom varies, showing perhaps 16X zoom alternated with occasional shots of a crowd of onlookers. Not surprisingly, due to the limited ability of videotape to capture the color of small objects, no color other than a slight pink was detected. The triangular array slowly turns clockwise, with lights occasionally extinguishing, and being replaced with lights on the opposite side. Figure 7 shows a col- lection of images of the object, with timing informa- tion. The on-screen time is shown where available; if not, the frame number is given. Apparent size changes are presumably due to zoom changes. The last image is that of an airplane-the center bright light is an anti- collision strobe light. The object appears to make about 15 complete revo- lutions. The turning is accomplished in slow turning, then bursts, both of which slow during the video. After 150 seconds, the time is real time as shown by the camcorder on-screen time display. Prior to 150 seconds, the time is estimated, assuming the camcorder ran continuously. This is not true; there are breaks of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2000 Page 9 unknown duration in the video, so timing prior to 150 seconds should be regarded as speculative. Note also that the time covered is longer than the video length; this is due to breaks in the recording. Several frames show smearing of the light images due to camera motion. No interesting highspeed bright- ness changes were apparent in such frames. Background stars useful In several portions of the video, background stars appear to be visible. These are very useful in that true object motion is apparent using the star as a reference point. Where two stars are visible, they are motionless relative to each other, corroborating the conclusion that these points are indeed stars.) These portions are: at 30 seconds, over 42 frames (8 points measured, although many more visible), object moves leftward and downward at a 45 degree angle, at a speed of 2.5 times its own length per second. at 97 seconds, over 32 frames (but only 3 frames showed a star), object moves right and upward at a 70 degree angle at a speed of 7X its own length per sec- ond. at 124 seconds, over 21 frames (but only 3 frames showed a star), object moves rightward and downward at a 25 degree angle, at a speed of 9X its own length per second. at 164 seconds, at 18:38:35, over 86 frames (9 mea- sured), object left and down at a 40 degree angle at a speed of 2X its own length per second. At 18:40:04, over 225 frames (18 measured with 2 stars), object right and down at a 17 degree angle at a speed of 6X its own length per second. At 18:45:45, over 31 frames (only 3 measured), ob- ject right and upward at a 28 degree angle at a speed of 11 X its own length per second. At 18:49:24, over 67 frames (7 measured), object right and upward at a 14 degree angle at a speed of 13X its own length per second. At 18:52:36, over 333 frames, (9 points measured using 2 stars) rightward and upward at a 44 degree angle, at about 1.4 times its own length per second. At 18:59:44, over 211 frames, (7 measured) leftward and upward at a 48 degree angle, at a speed of about 0.8X its own length per second. \"Its own length\" refers to the maximum distance between lights, the size of a possible dark supporting structure is obviously unknown. \"Frames\" are the I/ 30 second NTSC frames studied, although the original PAL video is recorded at 25FPS. In all cases, the ob- ject motion was a straight line over all measured inter- vals, within measurement error limits. Note that faster speeds correspond to fewer data points. As would be expected in the case of high ob- ject speed, only a small number of samples could be 18:52:36. 18:59:44 18:49:24 18:45:45 18:40:04 Figure 8 obtained before the star left the field of view. Also, fast motion smears out and obscures a dim object, making a star harder to find. The variety of directions and speeds may be better understood by looking at the series of lines in Fig. 8. The direction of each arrow shows the direction of the object, and the length of the lines represents the object speed. Note, THE LENGTH OF THE LINE DOES NOT REPRESENT THE ACTUAL PATH OF THE OBJECT, but rather its speed at the stated times. In summary, the description of \"patrolling\" is cor- roborated; between 30 and 97 seconds, the object turned almost completely around, turned right, down slow, right, up fast, then slowed and turned left. Note the number of near-right-angle turns. OTHER TURNS (WITH NO STAR AS REFERENCE) MAY HAVE OCCURRED. Remember this motion is ap- parent motion; the object could be moving toward or away from the camera and this motion would not be visible. The object is obviously not an airplane, or some device on an airplane: ignoring the lack of standard lighting, the path, and the 16:1 range of apparent speed is impossible. A turnable set of lights on a helicopter could make this video, but I doubt that numerous witnesses would fail to recognize helicopter noise. A helicopter would have particular difficulty making a 1-minute 180-de- gree turn silently. I know of no known cause for this phenomenon."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 June 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Ufology Profile British author Randies emphasizes research By Dwight Connelly Jenny Randies, one of England's most prolific writ- ers, has more than 40 books in print, about half deal- ing with UFOs. \"The others,\" she explains, \"are con- cerned with crop circles, ESP, public figures, and any- thing strange and interesting.\" She works full-time as a writer, but says she could not make a living writing only about UFOs. \"There's a limited market in Brit- ain, and my books have been appearing in America for only the past six or seven years.\" Ufology is \"very parochial,\" according to Randies. \"Until Tim Good's book was published in 1987, Brit- ish authors never got published in America. I now try to always include American cases in my books, and every book I've written in the past few years has been published in America. \"I have to write a lot of books to survive as a writer,\" she explains, \"even though I am single, live frugally, and have no family to support.\" She says she has never had a five-figure advance for any of her books, and her recent book, Something in the Air (titled Danger in the Air in the U.S. printing) was sold for $2,000. Al- though she considers herself a ufologist first and a writer second, she says she must write a mass market book about every 18 months in order to generate enough income. \"I try to compensate for this by also writing a book for ufologists which contributes something to the field. I can do a mass market book-which is what publishers seem to want-in three to four months. A research- oriented book can easily take a year to do.\" Randies does not shy away from revisiting cases and providing a new slant. One such case is the 1980 Rendlesham Forest case, which she first wrote about in 1983-84. \"It was too early to write about it then,\" she acknowledges. \"The case has changed beyond all recognition. I've been able to do a lot of investigation in the time since I first wrote about it, and I think I can now be pretty definitive. It's one of the few times I've written about a single case, because in Britain there is not much demand for this.\" Of the many books she has written, she says her favorite is The Pennine UFO Mystery, which has not been published in the U.S., and which sold only about 15,000 copies in Britain, going out of print about 14 years ago. This is a story about a so-called \"window area\" in Britain where UFOs seem to appear with great frequency, and is an account of one of Britain's top abduction cases (also one of Eddie Bullard's top 50 abduction cases). It was one of the first abduction ac- Jenny Randies counts that Randies investigated. \"I've recently written another book about aductions,\" she notes, \"which is a comparison of cases in 50 coun- tries. This one took a couple of years to research, but I really wanted to do it. It has a lot of statistics, which I used to do in my earlier books, but publishers don't like statistics.\" Like many research- ers, Randies has never had a close encounter ex- perience. \"I think what hooked me on the sub- ject, though, was seeing strange lights over our hotel while on holiday with my grandparents,\" she says. \"I was 11 years old, and discouraged from talking about it, since my grandparents were deeply religious Methodists. That just made me more determined to find out more.\" Randies went to college to study astronomy and physics, but found herself having endless arguments with her professors, who could not understand her fas- cination with UFOs. \"The way science was practiced was not the way I wanted to do things,\" she says. \"That experience did not endear me to science.\" She did teach geology at the middle school level until changes in her lifestyle pushed her in another di- rection more than twenty years ago. From 1975 to 1977 she served as research coordinator on the coun- cil of the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA) and as a publications editor, so she began writing \"for anyone who asked, and I never took money for anything I wrote.\" She says her first book was \"just one of those flukes. In 1976 I was organizing a conference in Birmingham very much like the MUFON Symposium, setting up a book stall. There was this book about cases in Austra- lia, and it was so bad I was incensed. The book jacket said the same author was going to write a book about British sightings. I was upset because there were no books about British sightings, but I didn't want this author to write it. I sent a letter to the book's pub- lisher, saying, 'You can't be serious considering pub- lishing this book. Don't you realize the harm it will do to the credibility of the subject?' It's just one of"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2000 Page 11 those things you do when you're young, but amazingly the publisher wrote back that he was not happy with that author either, and would I write the book? It took me three years to write with my MUFORA colleague Peter Warrington, but we did it. It was titled UFOs: A British Viewpoint, and was mostly a labor of love. I think I got a $400 advance.\" Randies still does not have an agent, and she in- tends to keep it that way. \"I'm afraid an agent would be constantly wanting me to write certain types of books just for the money,\" she explains. \"I want to control what I write. I still think of myself as a ufologist who happens to write books.\" The ufologist-rurned-writer has been working on a book which she feels will probably generate quite a bjt of criticism. \"It's about solved cases,\" she explains. \"It was written with two British colleagues, and its title is The UFOs That Were Never There. It's not a debunking book, but I suppose some people will view it as such. It can be a good guide for investigators, since the cases are carefully chosen to make points. Solved cases can provide valuable lessons. I doubt that it will get printed in the U.S., and it was very dif- ficult to find a publisher in Britain. It probably won't make any money,\" One of her most interesting experiences involved doing a program about UFOs for the British Broad- casting Cpmpany (BBC). Some 300 hours of taped interviews were boiled down to make a 30-minute pro- gram. ,As part of the process, Randies located the air crew 'involved in the Bentwaters-Lakenheath case. \"This was one of the 60 cases in the Condon Report,\" says Randies, and it was also studied by James McDonald and Philip Klass. \"All of these made fundamental errors,\" she ex- plains, \"not through any fault of their own-they didn't have access to the crew. I was able to interview three of the four crew members, who still had their log books. We took them back to Lakenheath, and the U.S. Air Force allowed us to wander the base for three days, recreating the sighting. All of the researchers had al- leged that the planes were single sealers, but actually they were two-seaters, so there were four aircrew in- volved, not two.\" In 1977 Randies was involved in attempting to set up a partnership called the UFO Investigators Network (UFOIN) between BUFORA and the Flying Saucer Review (FSR) magazine when Charles Bowen was edi- tor of FSR. BUFORA would continue as before, but cease pub- lishing its magazine, giving it more money for research. FSR would include a pull-out section for group mem- bers, help fund investigations in return for first publi- cation rights, and form a team of very experienced in- vestigators to work as part of BUFORA. Although BUFORA decided not to participate, UFOIN was formed and continued until 1981 when it merged with BUFORA and ceased working with FSR. Within the past year, however, Randies, who is no longer on the BUFORA council or affiliated with FSR, joined with Dr. David Clarke, and Andy Roberts to give UFOIN a rebirth as \"a loose-knit\" community. This time UFOIN will use the Internet instead of FSR, and keep the size of the group small. Like most ufologists, Randies is interested not only in cases, but in the possibility of government cover- up. \"The cover-up, such as it is, is there for a reason,\" she suggests. \"We cannot presume that all of the rea- sons are bad reasons. We tend to think we have the right to know things that we may not have the right to know. There are times when you do have to trust the people you've elected to do the right thing. I think a lot of the reasons for the cover-up are connected to what the government doesn't know, not what it knows.\" \"Some years ago I was invited to address Parlia- ment on UFOs. I didn't know if I was informing them, or if they were checking me out. The sense I got in talking informally with members of Parliament, includ- ing two former prime ministers, is that they know some- thing quite fantastic is going on, but it is completely out of their control, and they are baffled by it. \"I suspect,\" she adds,/'that there is also a cold war going on between governments for the technology in- volved, and they don't want this discussed dpenJy by scientists. There may be a government effort to use ufologists as stooges, feeding us bogus document > and other misinformation to get us to make wild staterr ents, thus turning the scientists off to the whole phenom- enon, and keeping research firmly under government military control: And MIB exist as enforcers of the cover-up. Of that I have no doubt.\" Randies says she has enjoyed being a full-time ufologist and writer. \"I'm certainly not sorry I got in- volved with UFOs,\" she says. \"I feel very lucky that I can work at this on a day-to-day basis and people will actually pay me to write about it. It's been positive, but it's also been frustrating as the evidence pulls you first one way, then the other. \"One criticism I get is that I sit on the fence. I don't deny that. I clearly have not made up my mind about many aspects of the UFO subject because I don't be- lieve that we objectively have enough evidence to draw conclusions.\" She adds that she feels it is okay to pursue the sub- ject in many different directions. \"One of the reasons I enjoy coming to America is because of the different perspective that Americans have. In Britain you are bombarded daily with skepticism and debunking.\""},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 June 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Southern Missouri crop circle area includes other strange phenomena By JoAnne D. Scarpellini, MUFON Field Investigator & Gary P. Hart, MUFON Field Investigator April, 2000-The Southern Missouri location that is the site of the small crop circle that yielded magnetic particles (MUFON UFO Journal, January 2000) is also the site of ongoing phenomena of other types. This area has had aerial light phenomena in recent months, and records of similar phenomena going back 50 to 60 years. Small orange lights, sometimes seen singly, sometimes in multiple displays, have been seen by a large number of witnesses over a fairly large area. These lights appear suddenly, are moving, and are visible for 5 to 15 seconds, sometimes a little longer. Larger lights, also orange, are seen appearing suddenly, but these larger lights sometimes remain stationary in the sky for as long as 5 to 10 minutes before moving off or extinguishing. The orange lights seem to exhibit some unusual optical properties, but this will need more observation, verification, and confirmation before any elaboration can be made. Seen by a number of witnesses are white lights, usu- ally aerial, but occasionally at or near ground level. The size of these lights varies from basketball size to being described as the size of a bus. On two occasions these white lights have been tentatively connected to some slight damage to a tree (the same tree in both instances). A white light about the size of a basketball was ob- served hovering in a small area over a small stand of pine trees (Shortleaf pine, Pinus echinata) on the top of a hill by the property owner and his wife. The light made random movements at treetop level over the trees for an extended period of time and was still visible when the witnesses fell asleep. Nearby cattle were not disturbed at all. The following day the area of the pine trees was examined by the property owner, who found a number of small branches had been snapped off and fallen to the ground or were caught in underbrush slightly above the ground. The branches, both fresh growing branches as well as some dead ones, were snapped off cleanly, exhibiting none of the usual \"green twig\" break seen in growing branches. The broken twigs were all under 1/2 inch diameter and no more than one foot long. No other trees were affected in any way. The entire hill has heavy growth of oak, hickory, cedar, etc., but very few pines. There was no apparent damage to the twig, other than breaking off with no visible changes (either na- ked eye or by examination with a microscope) in bark, needles or seed cones. The ground under the tree was not disturbed in any way, and no magnetic particles or other foreign material of any kind was found. The area was also surveyed with a professional meter to check for the presence of any possible residual radioactive material; none was found. The phenomenan was con- fined to the area surrounding one tree and was no larger than about 30 feet in diameter. About one month after this event the same thing recurred, this time being observed by the caretaker of the property. The area was again examined with the same results. The general area (for some miles around) has had reported aerial light phenomena, occasional \"craft\" sightings, and some cattle mutilations in fairly remote areas. These reports extend back over a period of nearly a year, the most active time seeming to be late winter and early spring. These researchers continue to maintain contact with witnesses in the area, and make frequent visits to up- date and keep current any findings, and we will moni- tor the growth of vegetation in and around the circle formed late last summer that was the source of anoma- lous magnetic particles. The areas of other circles will also be observed. The displays of aerial lights have continued and in- creased somewhat in the past two months. But con- tinuing reports from a fairly large area have only lights- nothing perceived as \"craft.\" Unusual effects play havoc with cameras, tapes, batteries By JoAnne D. Scarpellini & Gary P. Hart A recent trip to a Southern Missouri area with on- going anomalous activity produced some unusual events. In anticipation of witnessing some unexplained aerial phenomena, a video camera was set up on a tri- pod and a digital still camera was ready, lying on the car seat. Batteries in both cameras were almost new and fully charged, while there were two spare fully charged video camera batteries in the camera case, which was on the ground outside the car. In the trunk of the car was the digital still camera case with two spare fully charged batteries. The car was parked facing the direction lights have been seen with some regularity. The property owner parked his pickup truck with the rear facing the view-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2000 Page 13 ing direction and was sitting on a lawn chair in the truck bed. His video camera was on the floor of the truck bed within reach. There were several other people present, all watching for anything unusual. I had just closed the passenger door of my car and was walking around to the driver's side. The interior lights were still on. The observers began shouting \"there they are, there they are,\" referring to lights in the sky. I reached for the driver's door handle with the intention of grabbing the digital still camera off the seat. When my hand was about a foot from the door handle all four locks snapped into the lock position, the interior lights went out as if switched off (Note: these lights do not \"switch off; when the timer turns them off they grow dimmer and dimmer to extinc- tion), and the CD player which is in the glove com- partment ejected the CD carrier so violently it hit the compartment door. The car was not running, and nothing was switched on but the interior lights. This car is new and had been in my possession only three days when this happened. It was then, and is now, functioning perfectly. It has had no problems, electrical or otherwise. Temporarily ignoring the car, I ran for the video camera to turn it on. I found the tape jammed and damaged (it was a brand new tape just out of a sealed package) and the battery capable only of turning the camera on, reading out \"low battery\" and shutting down. Later I found the camera had been damaged in some way and required repair before it was usable. The digital still camera's battery was discharged, as were the two in the bag outside the car. The two spare batteries in the case in the trunk of the car were us- able, but about one-half discharged. The property owner picked up his camera from the truck floor only to find its battery was discharged as well, although the tape and camera were undamaged. There were no pho- tographic attempts that evening ! The car and truck batteries were unaffected, and ev- erything started and ran normally. These events occurred within 30 seconds of the ap- pearance of the anomalous lights. The lights were vis- ible intermittently for about one hour and were ob- served by everyone present. Within the past year another camera was damaged beyond repair, tape damaged, and the magnetic cod- ing on roll film rendered useless, making it impos- sible to machine print the film. As a result of these events we are assembling a camera that will, hope- fully, withstand a variety of outside influences. Editor's Note: Ted Phillips also experienced some of these same problems while attempting to film mys- terious lights-also in Missouri. Camcorder also fails in Argentina sighting San Carlos deBariloche, Argentina-Tele vision jour- nalist Noemi Molina reports witnessing a huge uni- dentified flying object over this city at about 9 p.m. on April 23 near the cathedral, but says she was unable to tape it with her camcorder. \"When I tried to activate the camcorder, the battery was drained, and there was nothing I could do.\" She described the object as \"like a giant ship which gave off multicolored lights and made an intense noise. It was moving slowly over the lake toward Chile. Thank God my sister also so it. It has been almost im- possible to sleep. It was fantastic. I'm still nervous.\" Other unnamed individuals reportedly also saw the object. The El Cordillerano newspaper contacted the local airport personnel, who said they had no informa- tion regarding the sighting. Paperboy reports close sighting in Nova Scotia cemetery Eugene H. Prison, MUFON Nova Scotia Provin-. cial Director, reports that further investigation of a black triangular object observed by a local paperboy has revealed some additional facts. The witness decided to take a shortcut through a cemetery to get a paper to a customer who wanted his paper very early. Upon entering the cemetery, he im- mediately felt something was not right-the wind was different and seemed to have a whining sound mixed in with it. After walking a considerable distance along the road into the cemetery, he felt a cold wind and noise come up behind him and, out of the comer of his eye, he watched a solid object pass about three feet away from his right elbow. He could feel the cold rush on his face as it passed. His scalp became hot as it went by. Once it had moved in front of him, he could discern its triangle shape and that it was cruising very fast just above the ground. He estimated the object was about nine feet tall and five feet along the base. It veered off sharply on a 45-degree angle after ne- gotiating a near 90-degree change of direction in the cemetery road. The witness reported tiny raised blisters that burned and stung so much if picked that it brought tears to his eyes and troubled his face and chest area. These be- gan shortly after the sighting and lasted a couple of days."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 June 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Speaker sharing: The expectations and the reality By Kathie Grimes Assistant State Director, Kentucky MUFON Speaker sharing is a good idea. It does offer more than one MUFON state or local group the opportunity to bring in a speaker at a fraction of the cost. It does bring new faces into the lectures. It can raise funds. It can increase membership in state and local groups. It can make involvement in ufology a lot more interest- ing and rewarding. It can do everything that was out- lined in the first article I wrote in the November issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. But... I now want to share with you the details I could not foresee before we had our first speaker. I hope that sharing our experience will help other groups venture into this endeavor with some confidence, and with greater initial success. Kelly Cahill, from Australia, was our first speaker. Most of us first heard of her significant encounter when she told about it at the 1999 MUFON International Symposium at Arlington, VA. It has since been de- scribed in detail in the April issue of the Journal: We were impressed with her and the case, so we wanted to bring her back to this country so those who did not get to attend the Symposium last summer could hear her. She was a good speaker who held the audience. A mad dash The first mistake we made was bringing her here when we did, which was the end of December, 1999, extending into the first part of January. There was not enough time to promote her, so turnout was not what we expected. We could not get the confirmation of her flight, so could not schedule dates and times for her to speak until it was within weeks of her arrival, and then there was a mad dash to get it all done. She flew into Memphis and was Tennessee's first speaker, as they kicked off her tour. They had pro- moted her on the radio and within the group, and I believe newspapers were also contacted. Their turn- out was around 20 people at the lecture, which was held at Ryan's steak house. Their only regret was the location, which they felt was too noisy and took away from her lecture. How- ever, their sprits were high afterwards, and they are looking forward to hosting another speaker. Marcia Prince was the major coordinator of the event there, and I felt she did a great job. She could see where it would bring in more people in the future. Scott Voight, my director, and I drove to Memphis and brought an ill Kelly Cahill back to my home out- side of Bowling Green, KY. She had contracted some sort of an illness, and I spent the next two days filling her full of vitamins and anything else I could think of to help her feel better. Well, it seemed to work. By lecture time in Bowl- ing Green she was ready to go. Do not always count on your speaker being healthy after a very long plane ride. In Bowling Green, which is a small city and a small group, there was a paying turnout of 7 people. Kelly could not stop laughing. She could not figure out why we would bother for seven people. She was upset that I did not have a carrousel projector, as she was accus- tomed to a remote control projector, and demanded one for the next two lectures in Kentucky. Note here: with 7 paying people, I could not afford to rent a projector and used what I could find, but ob- viously it is a good idea to find out what equipment the speaker needs beforehand. We split the proceeds of each lecture with Kelly, so the extra $75.00 we even- tually spent for equipment came partially out of her pocket. Some speakers have a set fee, and will not work on the basis of splitting the profits. I held the lecture in the Barnes and Noble bookseller's meeting room. They are nice enough to allow me use of the room when I need it free of charge. They may do this in your city as well, or some other business may offer you a location. Also I would like to note that I had her in Bowling Green because the man who shoots our video lives in town and, knowing that it would not be a video in high demand, agreed to shoot it if we did it in Bowling Green. Video tapes are available. If you contact me for details, I will get back to you. If you do have video done of your speakers, most video people will want to have a spare set of the slide show to shoot in their studio for a professional look in the finished product. I spent New Year's Eve day run- ning the slide show for the video tape. It took about six hours to get it right. I had Kelly's only set of slides and promised not to let them out of my sight. Please note: someone has to be the host or hostess for the speaker and take care of things like this. After Bowling Green, Kelly went to my director's home and stayed in the guest room there until the next lecture scheduled in Louisville. She spent her time going over her lecture and making use of the office and extensive library that Scott has built up for our members. Wonderful, but costly Our group in Louisville, expecting a large turnout, rented the Performing Arts Center. It was a wonderful setting, but the cost was $300. The turnout for that"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2000 Page 15 lecture was almost 40 paying customers. There were a lot of questions from the audience, and Kelly did a great job with the answers and of course the book sign- ing afterwards. Almost half of the people that came were from In- diana, which is right across the bridge. Had this event been held in a location that did not cost anything, there would have been a greater profit from this venture. As it turned out, the profit from the 40 present at Louis- ville was not much more than for the smaller groups, due to the cost of the facility. A free location From Louisville her next stop was Elizabethtown, KY, where her audience was about 15 paying mem- bers. This was also a small group, but the location was free, as was the equipment she needed for her lecture. From there she went to Canada on holiday, then flew to California, where she talked to a couple of es- tablished groups that numbered over a hundred each. California has brought in a number of speakers over the years, and they have built up a following. Speaker sharing can work. I think California paid her $100 per lecture, rather than doing the profit-shar- ing, plus one night's motel per event. They were re- sponsible for the remaining part of the air fare. Please keep in mind there was a $500 cost up front for us to pay for the plane fare to get her to our area, and the full air fare cost $2000 round trip from Austra- lia. In the original negotiations, Ohio was to pay a third of the $500 air fare, along with Tennessee and Ken- tucky, but they decided not to go ahead about three days after I committed to bringing her here, although they did send $ 100 to help out. Since Kelly had to pay $100 more by having to change her plane ticket to fly out of Louisville instead of Ohio, I promptly signed Ohio's $100 check over to Kelly to cover this. Then I had to raise the third of the air fare Ohio was to cover. The lesson? Make sure everyone is committed before making final arrangements. Breaking even Overall, I think we managed to just about break even, not counting some of our personal expenses. We sold about 65 tickets at an average cost of $15, bringing in $975, plus $167 from Tennessee as their share of the air fare. This left about $290 for Kelly after expenses, plus she raffled off a NASA Sky Lab piece and sold some books. We also sold a few shirts and things, which helped put gas in our cars. Had we paid for motels for Kelly, as I think California did, instead of having her in our homes, we would have gone in the hole. Tennessee lost money, but only had her at one location, and they paid for two nights of lodging. They expected this, and it did not bother them too much since this was their first time. Overall, despite some small crowds and other prob- lems due to inexperience, our project showed that bringing in speakers can pay for itself, as well as gain- ing publicity for your group and the UFO phenomenon. I assume that California, which is much more experi- enced, made a profit, even after paying for motels. I would suggest you contact the speakers you spon- sor and see if they will do radio interviews to promote their arrival. If you have them before the event, take them to the local paper and let them do an interview. The Elizabethtown newspaper did a nice spread on Kelly. Ask the speaker how to best promote him or her. Do not assume that they expect you to have all the answers. It is in their best interest to help you as much as they can. Look for free rooms to host lectures in. They do exist. Have things in place long before your lecture is going to take place. I would allow months to get it all set up and promoted. Had we had months with Kelly we could have had a much larger turnout. She was used to hundreds at her lectures. Seven people she found laughable, but she had her job to do and did it well. Ask questions I think the best thing to do when you start your speaker sharing program is to ask questions. Do not think for one moment that you have all the answers. The more questions you ask, the more you leam and the more successful your program will be. Start small and work up to the big names. When bringing in a speaker from another country you have to realize that they have their own customs. They have their own dialogue and they will be experi- encing some foods for the first time. Kelly had her first taste of pumpkin pie. She was amazed at our prices on some things. She was accustomed to paying about $60 for a pair of jeans and could not fathom seeing them for under $20 at the stores here. Kelly was a good house guest. She was easy to have around, and I would welcome her into my home again any time. Having the speaker for a house guest adds another interesting dimension to the process, and I rec- ommend it if possible. We have new names to contact in the future for not only Kentucky MUFON, but Indiana and Tennessee MUFON as well. We all learned from this experi- ence, and we are looking forward to our next exciting guest, who will be Erich von Daniken. Editor's Note: Other MUFON state or local groups who have brought in speakers are invited to share their experiences and suggestions."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 June 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Filer's Files By George A. Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region Georgia disc seen through skylight MARIETTA-Georgia State Director Tom Sheets advises that the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) in Seattle and MUFON of Georgia began a joint investigation into a close encounter with a brightly lit disc on May 2,2000. Peter Davenport, the Director at NUFORC, received a call from a credible Marietta GA, citizen regarding a disc that was observed through a skylight during the night. NUFORC, already assisting on another joint investigation in Georgia, relayed this infor- mation to MUFONGA for fol- low-up investigation. On May 3, MUFONGA Field Investiga- tors (FI's) Olivia Newton and Michael Hitt interviewed the witness, who was found to be very credible with many years devoted to work in the ministry. She awoke sometime between 3 and 5 a.m. and ob- served through her skylight a brightly lit disc over her home. The disc was gray metallic with a grouping of steady red and white lights on the bottom, something like \"headlights.\" As she watched, the craft tipped up to an angle on its side and revealed that the edge had three triangular shaped window-like structures. These were rotating in a clockwise direction. Light was also coming through the windows, but was not as bright as the lights on the bottom of the disc. The craft was over the trees that surround the clear- ing of her home. She also detected a faint whirring sound. As she watched, the craft descended down over her home until it almost completely filled the view from her skylight except for a few inches on one edge. The lights were intensely bright, lighting up the area like daylight. The craft then moved over the house away from the skylight toward the northeast. The bright glare from the lights lessening until it was gone. No EM effects were noticed, but the witness indi- cated that she was so focused on the event, that she felt as if she could not move. Her husband did not awaken during the event. Investigators Newton and Hitt estimate the craft size to be about 25 feet in diam- eter. The witness has agreed to make a sketch of the craft. Photos were taken of inside and outside the house. A related case? TUCKER-A second case may be related to the above case, as unknown objects were observed sev- eral hours earlier by three witnesses only 20 miles away from Marietta in Tucker, GA. One of the witnesses is MUFONGA Investigator David Brown of Norcross. David reports that he was at the home of his fiance about 10:15 p.m. He always glances skyward, and he noticed a bright round object lit with multicolored lights, about the size of a dime at arm's length. Binoculars revealed a nearby second object, but not as profusely lit. The objects moved slowly down be- hind the trees to the southwest. David felt these were not normal aircraft, helicopters, or any type of celes- tial bodies. He is probing further into this event and having the other witnesses prepare sketches independent of his own. Investigations continue. Thanks to Tom Sheets, SD-MUFONGA, ISUR Board Member. George A. Filer Flying triangle in Tennessee PINEY FLATS — Lady Morgan Moonstone writes, \"I'd like to report a sighting: On May 9,2000, at about 9:15 p.m, in the Piney Flats Industrial Park, I observed a triangle-shaped UFO hovering about 50 yards above the trees. \"It had a white light on each corner and an orange light in the middle of it. It made no sound and disap- peared before I could pull over to take a picture. It appeared about the size of a bus at my distance from the object. \"Two weeks earlier, I saw an orange ball-shaped light at a very far distance and was able to take a pic- ture of it, but do not have it developed yet. (I will send a copy if it turns out.) \"Additionally, several friends of mine have spotted this triangle-shaped UFO, and all of them have the same description. This particular area seems to be a hot spot.\" Abductees report similar ailments Robin writes, \"I was reading about the New Jersey abductees, and I want you to know that Chronic Fa- tigue Syndrome is well known with abductees as well as Fibromalgia. I suffer with Fibromalgia, and many abductees do. \"When I was abducted I immediately came down with Epstein Barr virus associated with Mononucleo-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2000 Page 17 sis. I was 14 years old at the time. I am 41 and still suffering, but with the Fibromalgia. It is painful to just move about at times, and I get most discouraged. If it is related to EM I hope they soon find the answers. \"My body can't take much more. Fibromalgia is not fatal from what I have been told, but it makes you wish you were dead. Dr. Kavorkian was dismissed for helping a woman commit suicide who had Fibromagia. I wonder if that was the correct move by the courts. Sometimes, I wish the pain would stop, but death? I question that.\" Note: Abductees report they suffer from several similar ailments that usually involve severe fatigue and pain. I previously reported that Chronic Fatigue Syn- drome and possibly Epstein Barr is helped by taking magnesium, according to England's University of Southampton. Most of the diseases are relatively new and often called yuppie diseases. Admittedly, we have very sketchy evidence to date, but many of the abductee ailments point to weaker immune systems that seemed to first develop about 1950, the time of the first UFO waves. We do know that UFOs develop massive elec- tromagnetic effects that could cause weaknesses in the human immune system. Ufologists have little resources for research, but studying the relationship between various diseases and UFO encounters would be fascinating. I always rec- ommend that a close encounter be followed by a visit to the doctor and blood tests. Perhaps its just another coincidence, but magnesium burns with a hot bright light, very similar to the hot bright lights reported on UFOs. We have a group of intelligent people who claim contact with UFOs, and they have measurable medical and physiological ef- fects that may help prove the existence of this phe- nomenon. UFO reported in Argentina TANDIL — The El Eco de Tandil Newspaper of May 5,2000, states, \"Residents claim witnessing UFOs over the area.\" Once again, several people claim to have seen powerful beams of light whose characteris- tics do not match those of any machines known to man. One of these persons is Hugo Macias, 60, who has worked for La Capital newspaper in Mar del Plata for the past 37 years. He has delivered newspapers every morning, traveling along a circuit made up of Balcarcel and Tandil, giving him a good knowledge of National Highway 226. \"On Tuesday at 5 a.m., as always,\" he explained, \"I left the newspaper at the National Gendarmerie at Planta Terrena, heading toward Mar del Plata. I trav- eled some 6000 meters and suddenly heard a very strange noise approaching me from behind, and I felt myself 'contained' within a powerful bright light. I say, 'contained' because the light covered a diameter of 50 meters, and penetrated all sides of my vehicle. It seemed to pierce the rooftop.\" He says this lasted \"seconds only, but they appeared to be rather long.\" There were no other vehicles on the road at the time. \"During the remainder of the trip,\" he explains, \"I may have passed two other cars. It was a light traffic day.\" Macias says he returned to Tandil, discussed the event with a group of friends and with a gentleman who belongs to the Army Command to whom he de- livers the paper every day. \"When I returned to Mar del Plata, I headed to the Gendarme Station to see if the duty guard had seen anything that night. The guard had left, but another one told me that on five or six separate occasions similar strange things had been seen.\" The next day Macias was shown a story appearing in the local evening paper about a similar case thirty minutes later over Tendril. The gentleman from the Army Command also told him that the guards on duty had also witnessed a light in the sky with a very strange shape. \"The Gendarmes don't discuss the matter because things can get complicated. If word of this should reach NASA, there would be disturbances and people look- ing into the subject. \"On my way from Tandil I talked with Sheriff Lopez of El Dorado (on Route 226), who's knowledgeable about UFOs, and he advised me on why the Gendarmerie avoids getting into the subject because it knows how NASA works: they can send an airplane with six scientists anywhere in the world and carry with them an all terrain vehicle in which they can visit locations in person. Many locals don't like strangers visiting them. \"My experience was lovely, because what began as fear is now the satisfaction of having been contacted by something that researchers in the field would like to have seen and never have,\" noted Macias. \"I am convinced that it was not from this world. The power of that beam of light is not a power produced by any luminous source that we have at this time.\" Macias concludes, \"I felt nothing at all physically then, but for the past two days I have felt headache, laryngitis, and many other symptoms. I'm just happy for the chance to have lived through a contact experi- ence like this one.\" Thanks (c) 2000.

According to McClelland, von Braun confirmed that he and associates went to the crash site. 1 These are, of course, second and third hand testi- monies, as any skeptic will be quick to point out. But is there other evidence of von Braun's possible asso- ciation with Roswell? After first hearing about McClelland's story I did some checking. What I uncovered were some early sketches by von Braun of an escape capsule design for rescue from spacecraft. 2 Such ideas were obviously never used in the Apollo program, and were only re- cently considered in light of the Space Shuttle Chal- lenger disaster. Where did von Braun get this idea? It turns out that the original MJ-12 Eisenhower Brief- ing Document, as well as additional documents being studied by Robert and Ryan Wood, refer to \"escape cylinder\" and \"ejection\" from the craft by the recov- ered occupants. These documents all have question- able authenticity, but an authentic document from the National Archives is far less controversial. The document, dated 28 October, 1947, by Gen. George F. Schulgen, Chief, Air Intelligence Require- ments Division, Office of the Asst. Chief of Air Staff-2, was prepared at the insistence of Gen. Twining that a \"detailed study of this matter\" should be made. 3 The document title \"Intelligence Requirements on Flying Saucer Type Aircraft\" includes the following descrip- tion: \"Items of Arrangements:... d. High altitude or high speed escapement mcth- j \" ods. It also has Roswell-like references such as: \"Items of Construction: a. Material whether metal, ferrous, non-ferrous. or nonmetallic. b. Composite or sandwich construction utilizing various combinations of metals, plastics, and perhaps balsa wood. c. Unusual fabrication methods to achieve ex- treme light weight and structural stability, particularly in connection with great capacity for fuel storage.\" Obviously the people at Air Staff-2 had some ideas about the so-called \"flying discs\" besides just the early reports of 1947! It is not proof, but approaches coinci- dence beyond reason. And there is more to this story, including the alleged involvement of a prominent Ger- man scientist who worked under von Braun at Ft. Bliss, TX, in 1947, who is also mentioned in more than one MJ-12 document. Further research on this subject con- tinues. Brian Parks References: 1.

General George Schulgen, AC/AS-2. Timothy Good comments on Alien Base review Thank you for your balanced review of my last book, Alien Base. A few clarifications are in order, however. The title (not Alien Bases, as you have it) is actu- ally mine, though the subtitle is not. My own, preferred subtitle (\"Earth's Encounters with Extraterrestrials\"), which appeared in the original edition, was changed for the American and British paperback editions. The book is not about the evidence for extraterres- trial colonization, per se (I leave that to other, more qualified authors), nor is it exclusively about alien bases, even if both themes feature fairly prominently. The title of the last chapter, \"Alien Base - Earth\" con- veys what I had in mind: Earth as an alien base. I'm sorry you don't find my 14-page index \"totally comprehensive.\" You state that there is no listing of the UFO \"repair cases\" cited, but in fact these are in- dexed by country under \"alien craft grounded\" (p.407). Perhaps I should have directed the reader more clearly via an entry under \"repairs.\" Finally, I am surprised that you think Alien Base \"plows little new ground.\" Other seasoned ufologists have told me that the numerous hitherto unpublished or little-known stories in the book have caused them to reconsider their overview of the alien phenomenon.

It required careful reading and provided much food for thought. The MUFON Forum commentaries and sightings were especially worthwhile and to the point. Roger Leir's work on sup- posed alien implants may be some of the most important work of all presently under- way, but I have to strongly emphasize the qualifier \"may.\" Despite talk of \"findings\" and \"scientific data,\" to the best of my knowledge the data have not been published in any scientific forum for review. Leir states that major univer- sities and laboratories have conducted numerous inde- pendent analyses of the.metallic artifacts. Have any independent scientists seen the test results? I suggest that scientists onthe MUFON advisory panel or among the readers start writing letters to the named institutions requesting copies of the test results for examination. Once again, there is ho such thing as \"secret science.\" Without full peer review we have only pseudoscience.  : Every contribution to the Forum contributes some- thing worthwhile. No matter whose theories about ab- ductions we tend to accept, Ann Druffel's \"abduction resistance\" techniques make: sense on a purely prag- matic level. During my active period working with abductees I told more than one that if the types of things they were reporting were happening to me, I would try everything, no matter how experimental or unconven- tional, from clumps of garlic around my neck to white noise, in an effort to make it stop. Dan Wright raises a very good philosophical point, though it seems reasonable to me to continue both FOIA and \"gentle persuasion\" in the attempt to ferret out in- formation. Although I agree that FOIA alone is exceed- ingly unlikely to get at the full truth, neither is any other single technique. FOIA requests have applied some pressure and siic- ceeded in prying loose a large amount of worthwhile information. We do have to be realistic about it, how- ever, and not put our faith or energy exclusively on that one approach. The comparison of different interpretations of the Ramey telegram allegedly concerning the Roswell crash is useful and instructive, and demonstrates clearly that the exact meaning still is wide open to interpretation. The \"new\" Roswell witness (he may or may not be new to some people) tells a story that dovetails per- fectly with other key testimony on record, and sounds totally authentic. Would he be willing to talk privately with Congressional investigators? If so, I suggest he be asked to contact the Fund for UFO Research in Washington, D.C. (Mount Rainier, MD, post office box) which could arrange a meeting. The sightings involving UFOs that buzzed or ha- rassed cars (four if we count the New Mexico proto- abduction case) suggest renewal of a past pattern which we haven't seen much of lately. Is some kind of new cycle of activity beginning? In my book Uninvited Guests I discussed the confronta- tional nature of these events. Other than attention-get- ting, it is difficult to imagine what the purpose of this behavior might be, if indeed there is a purpose behind it. In any case, it is important to continue investigat- ing and documenting such cases. I was saddened to learn of the death of Mildred Biesele, who was a staunch MUFON supporter and activist. We had many conversations at the sympo- siums over the years, and I found her to be a sweet, gentle person of high intelligence. CSICOP credo: Non potest, ergo non est (It can't be, therefore it isn't). Additional probable planets located European astronomers using the European South- em Observatory in La Silla, Chile, reported in May the detection of eight more probable planets orbiting other stars in our galaxy, bringing the total extrasolar planets thus far located to 43. The first of the newly-discovered planets was found orbiting a sun-like star in the constellation Scutum. This planet has an apparent minimum mass 80% of Saturn, making it one of the smallest planets thus far detected. Two additional planets only slightly larger than Sat- urn were found orbiting HD 83443 in the constella- tion Vela, and HD 108147 in Crux. Three other planets located are considerably larger. One orbiting HD 52265 in the constellation Monoceros is about the size of Jupiter, one orbiting 82943 in the constellation Hydra is 2.2 times the size of Jupiter, and one orbiting 169830 in Sagittarius is nearly three times the size of Jupiter. Two others are nearly ten times the size of Jupiter."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2000 Page 21 MUFON MERCHANDISE Wear official MUFON T-Shirts (royal blue printing on white cot- ton), sizes: S, M, L & XL.

At that time it sets only about three-quarters of an hour after the Sun. On the 31 st the dark edge of the crescent moon oc- cults (covers) the brilliant planet in the western U.S. after sunset. It will be a hard-to-see event, requiring an unobstructed WNW horizon. Elsewhere the 2 bod- ies appear very near each other. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mercury reaches a point farthest E of the Sun on July 27. It is visible at twilight low in the ENE the last week of the month. Look for the faint orange object below the thin lunar crescent on the 29th. Jupiter (-2.1) and Saturn (0.2), in Taurus, rise in the ENE close to 2 a.m. in mid-July. The 2 giants are then about 6 degrees apart below the Pleiades star cluster. On July 26 the crescent Moon makes a nice triangle with the 2 planets, being about 2 degrees below Sat- urn. Three Eclipses: Of a rare 3 eclipses occurring in a single month, 2 are observable in parts of the U.S. On the morning of July 16, the Earth's shadow hides the full moon. Early stages of the event can be seen in the western states (beginning about 5 a.m. PDT), while totality will be experienced only from western Alaska and Hawaii. From Hawaii the Moon enters the Earth's dark central shadow (umbra) at 1:57 a.m., is totally covered from 3:02 to 4:49, and exits the umbral shadow at 5:54. Two weeks later, on the 30th, the new moon covers a piece of the Sun in a partial solar eclipse visible from the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Local times of maxi- mum eclipse with obscuration percentages at several cities follow: Juneau, 6:56 p.m., 25%; Seattle, 8:10 p.m., 20%; San Francisco, 8:20 p.m., 7%. Do not look directly at the Sun! Instead, project the solar image through a binocular or telescope eyepiece onto a white surface. Moon Phases: Two new moons this month, both creating partial solar eclipses & both the nearest moons of the year. New moon— July 1 First quarter— July 8 Full moon— July 16 Last quarter— July 24 New moon— July 30 The Stars: The Summer Triangle high in the E nears the zenith of the sky after evening twilight ends. Meantime, low in the southern sky teapot-shaped Sagittarius the Ar- cher aims his arrow at red Antares, the stellar heart of the scorpion. In the N the Big Dipper, its bowl in a downward position, stands to the W of Polaris the North Star. Use the 2 Pointer Stars on the end of the dipper's bowl to find the surprisingly faint Polaris. (Extend an imagi- nary line eastward from the Pointers.) On the Fourth of July, look in the W during evening twilight and find the star Regulus to the lower left of the 3-dav-old lunar crescent.

UFO Sighting Reports A radical improvement in the lead articles published in the monthly Journal was noted starting with De- cember 1999. This has been due to the fact that our State/Provincial Directors, State Section Directors, and Consultants are writing narrative reports of their UFO investigations and submitting them to the International Director for publication. I know that there are many other outstanding re- ports that are only getting exposure in the pages of MUFON State and Chapter publications. This is an invitation to share these reports on an international level with your constituents worldwide. Another UFO pioneer passes on On May 4,2000, Leonard W. Sturm, MUFON State Section Director for Paseo and Hernando Counties in Florida, suffered a heart attack and passed away at the Regional Medical Center in Hudson, FL, at age 75. Leonard originally joined MUFON as a State Sec- tion Director on June 15, 1970, for the six counties sur- rounding Decatur, IL. Mr. Sturm graduated from the University of Minnesota College of Engineering in Minneapolis with a degree in electrical engineering. He was a Navy veteran of World War II and retired from the Illinois Power Company in Decatur, IL, as an electrical engineer. Leonard got interested in spiritual phenomenon and UFOs early in life, but when UFOs flew over Washington, DC, on July 19, 1952, the event especially sparked his interest. This culmi- nated in 48 years of investigating the phenomenon known as ufology. He was truly a UFO pioneer in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing on radio programs in Illinois discussing UFO propulsion systems and alien encounters, despite pos- sible ridicule for such beliefs and ideas. He continued his UFO research and sharing this knowledge with the public right up until he passed on, including regular MUFON chapter meetings. Leonard is survived by his wife, Helen; a daughter, Diane; two sons, Allen and Randy; and five grand- children. He and his family visited MUFON headquarters in Quincy, IL, during the early 1970s and later in Seguin, TX. Mr. Sturm was one of MUFON's early members and will be greatly missed.

LaFuente, B.A. (Londonderry, VT) is our latest State Section Director for Bennington and Windham Counties. Field Investigator Exams Passed As the world's largest and leading UFO organiza- tion, one of MUFON's goals is to have North America staffed with competent and trained Field Investigators in every state, province, and county. Kathleen Marden, Director of Field Investigator Training, is proud to announce that five members passed the Field Investigators exam this month. They are Frank T. Allotta (San Antonio, TX); Charles V. Boswell (Brandywine, MD); Robin M. Harris (Brooklyn Cen- ter, MN); Michael D. Hitt (Roswell, GA); and Ken- neth L. Larson (Los Angeles, CA). Numerous MUFON UFO chapters conduct Field Investigator classes throughout the country in a for- mal classroom environment. However, many of our members purchase the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, study the manual, and take the test like a cor- respondence course. The test may be secured from the headquarters office in Seguin, TX, and mailed to Mrs. Marden for grading. Missouri UFO Ballot Initiative Bruce A. Widaman, Missouri State Director, has advised that 20,000 of the 80,000 required signatures were obtained by the deadline of May 5, 2000, to put the UFO Awareness referendum on this year's Mis- souri ballot. This is an amazing number considering that they only had one and half months of time to se- cure 80,000 signatures. Bruce and his solicitors are to be commended for their efforts in what appeared to be an impossible feat, taking into account the deadline established by the State of Missouri. The experience gained from this difficult task can be applied to the other fifteen states that ac- cept initial referendums by their voters.
