Leir The latest implant surgery was performed by my surgical team on Feb. 5 in an attempt to get a better understanding of what the implants mean to us, the human race. This was the ninth in a series of these surgeries; the first two procedures were performed on Aug. 19, 1995. Since then much scientific data have been obtained and have provided a bit more insight into this strange phenomenon. The first eight surgeries have been chronicled in my book, The Aliens and the Scalpel, published by Granite Press and under auspices of The National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS). Perhaps it would be easier to start with the find- ings and then fill in the details. The eight previous surgeries produced nine objects. Of the nine objects, one turned out to be an ordinary sliver of medicinal bottle glass, and the others showed extraordinary sci- entific interest. We can divide the remainder of the objects into two basic categories: metallic and non-metallic. Three were in the non-metallic category and appeared as small little greyish white balls, about the size of a BB. The other five were metallic and were covered with a very strange grayish, dark, shiny membrane that could not be cut through with a scalpel blade.' Because of a lack of research funds, the little grayish-white balls have received less attention. We can definitely state that the structure of these small objects is totally unlike anything usually removed from the human body. First, what appears as a simple little small ball is not that at all, but con- tains a complex set of 21 different elements put together in a manner that seems to defy nor- mal metallurgical pro- cedures. Another finding per- tains to the carbon content, which is much higher than what is found within the cells of the human body. We will soon be looking at the isotopic ratios of the carbon to determine the amount of carbon 14 in the sample. If the amount is higher than usual, we could then theorize that they may function as a nanocomputer. It will also be interesting to see if the isotopic ratios fall within the standard of earthly ratios. We also have found that the relative state of matter of these objects suggests behavior that is scientifically curious. I have seen them appear as hard as a rock and then become soft and jelly-like, only to return again to the hard state. As with other research, only time will give us a better understanding of their nature. In reviewing the metallic objects, we can make a sub- , classification, such as those which are shaped like small cantaloupe seeds or those with other shapes. Of the five original metallic objects, three are shaped like little can- taloupe seeds, one is T-shaped, and the fifth is triangu- lar in shape. These are all covered with a very strange tough dark gray membrane that rejects opening with a surgical blade until the objects have been dried for 24 hours. Analysis of the membrane shows that it is composed of the body's own tissues and contains only three major factors: a pro- Surgeons review x-rays."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 May 2000 MUFON UFO Journal tein coagulum, hemosiderin, and keratin. A search of the medical and pathological literature reveals no such combination of tissue thus far removed from the hu- man body. The metallurgical components have undergone extensive analysis at some of the world's most pres- tigious laboratories, such as Los Alamos National Labs, New Mexico Tech, and the University of Cali- fornia at San Diego. There have been numerous other laboratories that have looked at portions of these ob- jects, such as York University in Toronto, Canada, Camet Labs in Santa Barbara, and Seal Laboratories in El Segundo, CA.The list goes on. I thank them all for their time and participation. Essentially the metallurgical findings are as fol- lows: the specimens are composed of an outer clad- ding of approximately 11 individual elements. They surround a core that is either magnetic iron or magnetoconductive carbon. In vivo [in the living body] two of the original eight objects are apparently emitting an electromagnetic field which produces about 3 milligauss on a simple gaussmeter. When the objects have been removed there are no detectable emanations. The use of a scan- ning electron microscope demonstrates that the mem- brane is physically attached through small openings in the metal. I believe it is safe to say at this point that there is no technology available to reproduce this find- ing. Surgery Nine: Tim Cullen Tim's surgery was performed on Feb. 5 of this year. He is allowing the use of his correct name and is ea- ger to get this information released to the world at large. He has kept this a secret for over twenty years, but now will come forward with the full story of what he remembers in his encounters with Alien beings. Tim, as with the other surgical patients, was not allowed to undergo regressive hypnosis until after the surgical procedure was performed. One attempt was made late in the day of the surgery, but he was appar- ently in too much of an excited state to undergo a hypnotic procedure. He is willing to return to Cali- fornia soon and undergo hypnotic regression with my new associate, Yvonne Smith. Tim originally contacted me by e-mail more than a year ago. He had found me on the Internet and de- cided to ask for help with his case. He believes that he has had the implant since a UFO encounter in 1978. He lives in a small agricultural town, Yuma, CO, where he was born and raised. Tim has three daughters who he feels are now old enough to know what happened to him. He discov- X-ray of object near bone. ered his object after he accidentally hit his hand with a hammer. The doctor looked at his x-ray and asked him if he knew how he got a piece of metal in his left wrist. He was totally unaware of any injury and did not have any visible penetration wound. Later he began to ponder the situation and came to the conclusion that this object was placed in his body during a UFO sighting that he had on May 30, 1978. He and his wife were returning to their residence in Yuma from a trip to Denver. They were on Highway 59 near the Vernon Road junction when they encountered a very bright object which crossed the road in front of their car. The time was 11 p.m. They both were able to see the object quite clearly as it crossed in front of them. The object, which he states was like a disc in one view and then appeared more cigar-shaped in another view, finally landed out in a field adjacent to the road. His curiosity was piqued, so he put the car into re- verse and backed up until he was parallel with the ob- ject. Suddenly two extremely bright lights came on, and he was about to get out of the car to get a better look. His next recollection was that his hands were on the steering wheel and he was saying to his wife, \"I think we better get to town now.\" He describes the object as being about 100 feet long, twenty feet wide and about ten feet tall. When this hap- pened he had no thoughts of missing time, but now he is"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2000 PageS certain that was the case. Tim and his wife, a registered nurse, have had other sightings and episodes involving UFOs. The last one was in 1994. He also stated that numerous cattle muti- lations were going on in that area. The most recent one was about two months ago. From the beginning Tim was very cooperative and followed my advice very closely. He sent me the first set of x-rays, which I submitted to our radiologist, who confirmed the presence of a metallic foreign body in Tim's left arm, just above the wrist. I relayed the mes- sage back to Tim, and he stated he wanted the object removed. I advised him that I would start the ball roll- ing so that he could come to California and have the procedure performed. My next task was to raise the funds. I did not want to involve the entertainment industry again as they have had a tendency to really interfere with the amount of knowledge that can be obtained in a scientific manner. I contacted two individuals in the UFO Research arena. One was Michael Lindemann of CM News and the other was Whitley Strieber. I knew they were both in- terested in my research and fortunately they agreed to help get a funding program going. I am happy to report that most of the funds came from within the UFO community. I sincerely believe that if this cooperation was available to all the legiti- mate researchers, a lot more could be done to help solve this immense puzzle. I also must acknowledge, a very true blue friend, Mr. Greg Avery, the MUFON State Director for Louisiana. Without his help this surgery would have never been performed. There was also some help from other friends who are outside the UFO loop but believe in my work. On Feb. 5 the surgery was performed by a general surgeon and the same surgical team that was used for the past procedures, which included a number of MUFON members from the Ventura-Santa Barbara section; The object that was removed was to my sur- prise another one of the little cantaloupe seed-shaped objects. This now makes four of this type and, yes, it was also covered with this strange membrane. Prior to the procedure being performed, we were able to detect an electromagnetic field around the area of the object. It registered about 3 milligauss on the gaussmeter, and the use of a tri-field meter showed a reading of about mid scale. Bob Beckwith, our research partner and electrical engineer in Florida, designed a specialsensitive probe that would capture a waveform pattern on an oscillo- scope. Unfortunately, we did not get the correct scope to mate with the probe and only got a partial response â¢X ^jwrrr^ f^x*( ]Â£>â¢*>* ^-4v^ Object on a surgical sponge. which was not a waveform pattern. Even though this part of the experiment was a failure, we did manage to get data that was far beyond what we had previously. The patient also underwent laboratory testing to see if there were any changes in his electrolytes, hormones or neurotransmitters. We now have this data on two individuals, and it is my hope that when we have a larger group we will have the opportunity to see if there is a pattern. I feel that this object has already offered more sci- entific data that all the others, and this is only scratch- ing the surface. We have filmed this object with still and video photography using ultraviolet, Infrared, and incandescent lights. For the very first time the object was filmed through the lens of a dissecting microscope, and the results were mind boggling. The membrane appears shiny and slick. When a magnet comes within about an inch and a half of the object, the object simply flies to the magnet. When the object is placed on the lab bench and a mag- net is held above it and moved back and forth, two small what appear to be pseudopods protrude and point to the magnet. We are just beginning. The object is now in a labo- ratory that uses the Atomic Force Microscope. They also will be using an Atomic Field Microscope. The scientists in this project are so excited that they are doing this without charge and contributing the world's newest and most expensive equipment to look at the object with the membrane still attached. It seems each new thing they do only produces more surprises. Even- tually the membrane will be removed and the metal- lurgical testing will begin. Both, the NBC television program \"Extra\" and the Learning Channel have expressed interest in filming these events. I would not be surprised if you will soon see this material on one of the major TV channels."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 May 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Dr. Barry Downing Is UFO Midnight a possibility? By Dr. Barry H. Downing The French study \"Les OVNI et la Defense\" includes a chapter concerning UFOs and religion (\"Implications politiques et religeuses\"), and I believe somewhere there is a secret American UFO study with a chapter entitled \"Reli- gion and American UFO Policy.\" Unfortunately I know of no established religious in- stitutions that have studied the implications of UFOs for re- ligion. Only individuals with a personal interest have pur- sued these issues. I suspect that the Roman Catholic leaders have consid- ered the UFO situation, and perhaps have even been in- formed by high level officials of some world govern- ments that UFOs are real. Nevertheless, there have been no statements from the Pope concerning UFOs. Mon- signor Corrado Balducci of the Vatican has, however, gone on record saying he believes UFOs are real, but believes they come from the natural order, not the su- pernatural order. (See my article \"The Balducci Inter- view and Religious Certainty,\" MUFON UFO Jour- nal, September 1998). The Balducci statements put Roman Catholics in a reasonable position just in case governments start releasing UFO information. The same reality My operating assumption is that what we now call the UFO reality, and what the Bible calls the angelic reality-in both its Old and New Testament forms-is the same reality. As I have argued at length in The Bible and Flying Saucers, as well as in several MUFON articles such as \"Exodus as a Paradigm of UFO Strat- egy\" (MUFON UFO Journal, October 1994), I not only believe it is possible that events such as the parting of the Red Sea were caused by the alien/angelic reality, I also believe that it may be possible, within certain lim- its, to study these key biblical events with the hope of discovering a pattern, a model, a paradigm, for UFO behavior. In other words, it may be possible by studying UFO/ About the Author Dr. Barry Downing has been a MUFON consult- ant in theology since 1972, is author of the groundbreaking The Bible and Flying Saucers, has written numerous articles for the Journal, and has been a speaker at several MUFON symposia. He has been assistant pastor and pastor at Northminster Presbyterian Church in Endwell, NY, for more than 30 years. alien behavior in the Bible to predict current UFO strat- egy. At the very least, the Bible should provide one dimension of the data used to understand the UFO phe- nomenon. Light years ahead It is also my operating assumption that the UFO civi- lization, whatever it may be, is not \"just like us, ex- cept a little more advanced,\" as the ancient astronaut theory of Erich von Daniken and the French OVNI document suggest. Rather, I believe the UFO civiliza- tion may be light years ahead of us, perhaps both bio- logically and technologically, and that they have cre- ated life on Earth. This is an important distinction, because it changes our expectations about what the UFO civilization has done, is trying to do, and will do. The French OVNI document suggests it is plausible that UFOs are wait- ing until our society is a little more advanced before landing openly and welcoming planet Earth to the in- terplanetary brotherhood of space travelers (this is my loose interpretation of the French view.) The French view is more appealing to the human ego than my view that the UFOs have made us, and are guiding us. But if UFO civilization has created us, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that there is no need for the aliens to \"invade and take over\" in typical Hollywood war of the worlds fashion. They already own us. The bad news is that we are left with the ques- tion, \"Who are these guys, and what do they want?\" Known to be real My broad but unprovable view of the UFO situa- tion is this: UFOs have appeared all over the world, they are real and guided by extraterrestrial intelligence, many world governments know they are real, but it is not seen to be in the interests of world governments to announce this reality. The French OVNI document has not been released as an official document of the gov- ernment, but it may cross the line of what I suppose has been an unwritten code of ethics among world governments: keep lying about UFOs. At the same time, the UFO reality has itself helped"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2000 Page? the world governments keep the lie going. UFOs have not landed on the White House lawn, and no aliens have appeared on \"The Tonight Show.\" Unless gov- ernment leaders have a crashed UFO they could present at a news conference, and could prove we didn't build it, it might be difficult for any government to prove to Philip Klass and other skeptics that UFOs are real. My assumption is that the current situation is as the UFO angelic/aliens want it to be. Everyone in the world knows UFOs might exist, but only a few people know for sure. Some know from direct UFO encounters, oth- ers know as government agents in charge of UFO stud- ies, and others, like myself, believe but have never seen. What is UFO strategy from this point on? It may be that the aliens are content to leave things as they are for hundreds or thousands of years to come. That is, they will fly in our skies, occasionally buzz a military or commercial jet, and occasionally, for reasons we do not understand, abduct humans from cars and homes and then put them back. World governments will con- tinue to lie. Science not the answer? MUFON will continue to do research, but never re- ally get to look behind the UFO curtain. This is some- thing of an insult to our scientific mentality, because our assumption is that with good science, we can fig- ure out anything. I think it is a false assumption. I own a herd of beef cattle. They live on a farm about five miles from my home. My cows know who I am, they know I open gates for them and lead them to new pasture. They respond to my voice, coming when I call them. (\"The Lord is my shepherd.\") I doubt that they have a group of cow scientists trying to figure out where I come from, but if they did, would they ever figure out that I am a clergyman (whatever that might mean in cow culture), or that I am a consultant to MUFON? Since cows and humans are mammals, I may have more in common genetically with cows than with aliens. If the UFO reality does not want us to understand who they are, our science is in big trouble. If the UFO real- ity wants to stay hidden behind a curtain, I am sure it can. It is possible that the UFO reality has shown enough of itself so that bit by bit the UFO story will slowly seep into our human culture. In that case, somewhere in the future the types of religious questions I have asked will be asked by religious leaders in general. This pro- cess might take decades. I may be long dead before serious discussion of UFOs and religion takes place. When midnight strikes But if the UFO civilization wanted to jump start a religious discussion of the meaning of UFOs, the means are available. We might face a \"UFO Midnight.\" The story of the exodus begins with an angel of God meeting Moses in a burning and talking bush (Ex. 3). If this is our current UFO reality at work, we no- tice it can communicate verbally, but seriously restricts this communication to Moses throughout most of the exodus process. In this way, the divine/UFO reality by and large stays hidden, while at the same time re- vealing itself. Resists God's demands Moses is sent to Pharaoh to demand the release of Jewish slaves, with the promise that many plagues will come on Egypt if Pharaoh does not meet the demands of God. Pharaoh resists God's demands, and plagues of flies, frogs, blood, and other problems come upon Egypt, but Pharaoh endures all these problems. Then comes the warning that at midnight on a given night the first-bom males of Egypt, along with the first-born of the cattle, will die (Ex. 12:29). Humans are targeted for death based on race, gender, birth or- der, and a specific time. But the angel of death \"passed over\" the Jewish first-bom males, leading to the Jew- ish celebration of Passover. After Passover, Pharaoh saw the lightj and let the Hebrew slaves go free. It would seem, although many MUFON members might hope it would not be true, that if our modem UFO reality can invade homes at night, abduct people in their sleep, and then return them to their beds, then killing people off in their sleep would be fairly easy for such an extraterrestrial power. I doubt this kind of violence would be visited on our culture by the aliens unless, as in the exodus, our political leaders were warned to obey some kind of command (like Pharaoh) and disobeyed. But the Passover story - with its dark side, the Egyp- tian Midnight side - can be a sign to us that UFOs can on occasion choose to interact with human culture in a very violent and powerful way. Then the question becomes: might there be a UFO Midnight ahead for us? If so, what form might it take? The second coming The most obvious answer from the Christian point of view would be the second coming of Christ. In this view, the day of final judgment would be here, Christ would come with his angels, and begin to rule the earth openly. (Matt. 13:36-43; 16:27; 24:15-31; Acts 1:6-11) I have explored the possible relation between UFOs and the second coming of Christ in Chapter 6 of The Bible and Flying Saucers. At the second coming, Christ comes from Heaven to take the church to be his bride, which is the Chris- tian midnight. \"But at midnight there was a cry, 'Be-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS May 2000 MUFON UFO Journal hold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.\"' (Matt. 25:6) Are we near a Christian UFO midnight? I do not know. If we are, then, by and large, Christians are sleep- ing through it. Jesus said, \"Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this: if the householder had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into.\" (Matt. 24:42,43) We may be at UFO Midnight. But we may not. If the exodus story, and the Jesus story, are^UFO patterns, then the preferred mode of operation is to impact hu- man society with minimal direct contact. The story of the exodus, including the ethical content of the Sinai story, and the culture of the Jewish people, have liter- ally influenced all of western civilization. Yet, the con- tact with \"the angel of God\" was almost totally limited to Moses, even though the \"pillar of cloud and fire\" could be seen by all. The same is true if Jesus is part of the work of UFO civilization. In a way, Jesus himself came to Earth like a thief in the night, and his other worldly nature was not understood even by his disciples until after his res- urrection. The day before midnight Suppose the UFO civilization wants to keep this ce- lestial game of hide and seek going. What might be the next move? It might not be UFO midnight. Let us suppose that our American government, and most world governments, know very well that UFOs are real and extraterrestrial, as the French study \"Les OVNI et la Defense\" understands. Until now our American lie about UFOs has enabled religious lead- ers to be blind to what UFOs might mean for religious faith. But suppose that the UFO reality wanted UFO se- crecy to end. I believe the secrecy could be ended very easily, and without direct contact. If UFOs started ap- pearing throughout the world, in a fairly open way, al- lowing themselves to be video taped, perhaps in front of large crowds, it would not be long before the se- crecy lid would be broken. The initial American public announcement might go something like this: UFOs have been appearing in our skies, as everyone knows. United States scientists and military leaders have been studying UFOs for decades, and have not commented on UFOs, except to say that we do not be- lieve UFOs are a threat to national security. Observing human life Although UFOs are appearing more openly now, it is still the opinion of our military intelligence person- nel that UFOs are not a threat to our national security. UFOs seem to be interested in observing human life, but they do not seem to want to interfere with human nations or cultures. It may be that UFOs have been observing humans since biblical times. The prophet Ezekiel reported seeing a strange \"wheel within a wheel\" in the sky. The United States government will cooperate with other world governments in surveying the UFO situa- tion, and try to determine UFO purpose. It may be that we are moving to a time when we will have direct contact with the UFOs, but if that time comes, we ex- pect the contact to be friendly, not hostile. We now know we live in a time that is scientifically very excit- ing. Planet Earth now has new possibilities. We think all Americans should look forward to these possibili- ties with new hope. Mueh turmoil At this point, there would certainly be a lot of tur- moil throughout the world. There would be anxiety, the financial markets would be in flux. Public admis- sion of the UFO reality might lead the aliens to back off, to cut down on open appearances. As fear receded, then the cultural and religious changes would begin. Eventually, the media would turn their attention from military leaders to religious leaders. Religious lead- ers would be asked very tough questions: wasjthe Red Sea parted by aliens? Was Jesus an alien? All world religions would be affected by this new situation. Richard L. Thompson has outlined in his book A lien Identities the possible relationship between UFOs and Hinduism. Hinduism provided the spiritual soil from which Buddhism was bom. Islam would not be as directly impacted, except that Mohammed received special revelations, and as we begin to explore to what extent the aliens influence our dreams, our unconscious life, eventually Islamic leaders .would perhaps consider whether the aliens caused Mohammed's revelations. Also, Mohammed believed both Moses and Jesus were prophets, so that issues relating the aliens to Moses and Jesus would impact Islamic theology. Most immediate impact The most immediate impact of the release of UFO information on religion would be on the Jewish tradi- tion. The story of the exodus can be read as an ex- tended alien encounter. It is less easy, but possible, to read the story of Jesus as having been under the con- trol of aliens. Orthodox rabbis have seen my UFO the- ology as detracting from the sacredness of God, and I understand that point of view. Detracting from the sacredness of the biblical tradition has been a concern"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2000 Page 9 of mine even as I have done my work. But I believe we need to have the faith to explore the possibilities that are before us. More cults Release of UFO information would probably lead to more cults, like that of French race car driver Claude Vorilhon, now known as Rael, author of books such as Space Aliens Took Me to Their Planet, and Marshall Applewhite, who was among the 39 members of the Heaven's Gate cult who committed suicide. (See my article \"The Second Coming of Marshall Applewhite,\" MUFON UFO Journal, May 1997.) Immediate Roman Catholic response would perhaps be to say that Roman Catholic leaders have believed for some time that there may be other life in the uni- verse. At the same time, Catholic leaders like Monsi- gnor Corrado Balducci have spoken openly of their belief that UFOs are real. Catholics would encourage further scientific study of UFOs, and suggest that UFOs come from the natural realm, not the supernatural realm. This will insulate Catholicism from debating, at the beginning, .whether UFOs might be connected to Christian faith. Technological miracles But it will soon be obvious to all that the Christian tradition never considered the possibility that the miracles in the Bible might be the work of an advanced technology, not the work of the supernatural. And we will realize that the more advanced a technology, and perhaps a species, becomes the more supernatural it might appear. Fundamentalist Protestants will be di- vided. Some might dare hope that UFOs carry the an- gels of God. But others will be sure that UFOs are demonic: \"And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations which are at the four corners of the earth.\" (Rev. 20:7,8). This is the direction already taken by Timothy J. Dailey in his book The Millennial Deception: Angels, Aliens & the Antichrist. If UFOs were to come into the open in the year 2000, Christian millennialism, already in high gear, would become more powerful. Books like that by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins Left Behind, would gain more readers. Protestant liberalism, which has long supposed that events like the parting of the Red Sea never happened - the story is seen as religious myth - will now have to start reading the Bible in a totally different way. For some religious liberals, religion is about emotions, beauty, love, and justice, and they will be confused that anyone cares what the \"facts\" are that brought about the biblical tradition. A slow transition But I believe the huge center of religion-both Jew- ish and Christian in American culture-would begin to approach the biblical tradition in light of the possibil- ity that our religious faith grew out of response to the UFO reality. Initially, religious leaders would feel very betrayed by government lies that kept them in the dark for decades. But eventually these leaders would de- mand the best scientific evidence from our government to try to interpret the biblical tradition in light of this evidence. The whole way in which religious questions are raised would change. In the past the question was: how could the Red Sea really part? Now the question would be: if the UFO reality started the biblical tradition, why did they do this? Is this some strange godless interga- lactic experiment? Or are the aliens truly the angels of God, and if so, how do they relate to God? In this sense what I call \"God's Game,\" which is a faith game, would still be in play, but with different questions. I am not saying this will happen. But if what we now call the alien UFO reality has started the biblical faith, then I see three options for their UFO strategy: 1) leave things as they now are, with the UFO reality known to world governments, but not known to the general population, 2) push a little more and expose the UFO lie without making direct contact, or 3) move to UFO midnight, land, and make open contact. I kind of like option 2. But time will tell.

Burleson, PhD. in the March 2000 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. I find it very interesting that Dr. Burleson's reac- tion to finding the name \"Carlsbad\" in the Ramey let- ter was one of surprise and disappointment. His com- ment \"...Carlsbad really makes no particular sense. No one expected or wanted it to say Carlsbad, and we don't know why it does say that. No one has ever suggested. until now, that Carlsbad had anything to do with the Roswell incident.\" (All emphasis mine.) EXPECTED?? WANTED?? Those two words cast a shadow over the Doctor's objectivity in this matter. My personal reaction was, SURPRISE, that's exactly how important research information is often uncov- ered. During the past 25 years of my renewed interest in UFOs (22 of those on active duty with the US Air Force) I've read numerous articles and books about the Roswell incident. I've also watched many TV documentaries on the subject, and they all rehash the same basic info over and over; with the notable excep- tions of Mr. Randle's book and the writings of Mr. Stanton Friedman. During this time, there are some questions and points of information that have not been covered. ITEM: Every article, book, TV documentary, etc claims that after the debris was collected, it was loaded into a B-29 and flown to Wright-Patterson by way of Ft. Worth. I don't believe that. The B-29 barely had room enough for the crew members and their equip- ment. I believe that some representative pieces of the debris were flown that way because the bomber was much faster than any transport planes available at that time and the \"powers that be\" wanted to personally verify the material's existence before any major logis- tical operations were planned and implemented. Re- member-the crash site was several acres in size, and the extended location had a mostly-intact \"heel shaped\" craft. All of this material was necessarily crated and moved by trucks. ITEM: The generally accepted story has said that all of the material and the bodies of the UFO's crew were taken to Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, simply be- cause the Foreign Technology Division was headquar- tered there. This makes no sense. Most of the re- search scientists (PhD's) employed by the U.S. Gov- ernment/military were in New Mexico: at Los Alamos and Alamogorda (White Sands Proving Grounds): Los Alamos Scientific Laboratories opened formally in April, 1943, and remained a closed city until 1957. Then it was another 10 years before residents were allowed to buy property. White Sands Proving Grounds was the largest land- area military reservation in the U.S. Missile testing began there in September, 1945. It's my belief that only a total idiot would have ordered the most prized material in modem history to be moved to a relatively small military base sitting \"cheek and jowl\" with a large city (Dayton, OH), and at least 2000 miles away from the largest \"brain-trust\" of research scientists in the world. These scientists were already established in the most secure research facilities in the country, sur- rounded by thousands of acres of government con- trolled property. General Ramey and his cohorts may have been many things, but they were not idiots. Now to the central point. Why Carlsbad? I believe the reference is to the caverns, not the town. Carlsbad Caverns have an average temperature of 56 degrees F. the year around, have miles and miles of unexplored caverns, and have approximately 60+ known cave openings of which only one (1) was in use in 1947. In addition, all of this is located on 46,080 acres of government-controlled national park land. If you look at a topographical map of this park, you'll see just how inaccessible the majority of the known cave openings are to the general population, which lends itself to ex- cellent security opportunities if you're the U.S. gov- ernment. Now, if I had a recovered space vehicle which was filled with deliciously mysterious, electrical-appear- ing equipment, I would look for a temporary facility with a temperature that's not too hot and not too cold to store my find in until something more useable could be constructed. Remember, in 1947 climate control equipment was cumbersome, at best. So Mother Nature's refrigerator was a Godsend - and only 90 miles down the road. The quoted newspaper article states that a Civil Air Patrol group made-up of 71 people toured the caverns with many apparently military folks. That seemed curious to me until I remembered that the Civil Air Patrol is a civilian auxiliary of the Air Force that oper- ates under the guidance of the military. What better way to disguise civilian scientists whose lack of mili- tary bearing would be too obvious to hide with bonified military uniforms? Additionally, having a group of scientists (71) openly accompanying a larger group of military people on a tour of the caverns would have raised too many ques- tions. (An added bit of trivia: the U.S. Air Force be- came a separate branch of service in September, 1947. A happy coincidence???) The last line of the article"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2000 Page 11 states, \"They departed for El Paso shortly after return- ing.\" Why El Paso? Short answer-Ft. Bliss, which is adjacent to White Sands. What distances are involved here? Roswell, Carlsbad Caverns, Los Alamos, Alamogordo, and Ft. Bliss are within 325 miles of one another. In addition to the caves in Carlsbad Caverns Na- tional Park, there are several more located in the Lin- coln National Forest, which is attached to the western boundary of the park. This whole area is collectively part of the Guadalupe Mountains. The maps that I'm looking at were compiled from county maps provided by the New Mexico State Highway and Transporta- tion Department and were combined to form an atlas/ gazetteer. I've spotted something very interesting in the Lin- coln National Forest, just north of the New Mexico/ Texas line and just west of the Carlsbad park. There is a long gravel road that deadends on top of a mesa named Canyon Ridge, and the only things there are a natural spring called Devil's Den Springs and a heli- port. The closest structure showing is a house about 3 miles away on another gravel road in another canyon. AIN'T THAT WEIRD??? Bill Dungan Jr. State Section Director, MS MUFON wdungan@dedac .com The Washington, DC sightings Dear Editor, In the March 2000 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal (number 383) on page 16 Robert Lieser has used as a reference, my manuscript \"THE UFO/FBI CONNECTION,\" written in 1997. I am pleased to be able to announce that within the last year the book was accepted for publication by Llewellyn Publishing Co and should be in bookstores by the time you read this. In his article Mr. Lieser has raised the question, why didn't the Air Force react more quickly and forcefully (with scrambled jets) when UFOs were detected over Washington, DC, in July of 1952? He cites a docu- ment, referenced in the above named book, which could provide the answer. The document was written in April, 1952, by either Stephen Possony, who was the Chief of a special study group set up to analyze foreign \"special delivery sys- tems\" or by his associate, Lt. Col. Sterling (this docu- ment was found in the Air Force intelligence file at the National Archives). The most interesting statement in the document reads, in part, \"the Air Force cannot as- sume that flying saucers are of non-terrestrial origin,...\" This document was written to be signed by General Garland who was the Assistant for the Production of Intelligence under General John Samford, the Direc- tor of Air Force Intelligence. Hence it appears that Possony knew the top levels of the Air Force \"assumed\" that flying saucers were extraterrestrial. Based on this interpretation one can guess at why there was no immediate response three months later when saucers \"attacked\" the capitol: per- haps the top Air Force officials realized that there was nothing they could do'but hope that it would all \"go away\" if they did nothing (no scrambles of aircraft), whereas, if they scrambled aircraft everyone would find out what had happened and realize that the Air Force was treating the saucer problem seriously. Unfortunately for the Air Force the UFOs stayed around the area so long that they had to scramble...and, just as they feared, the press found out about the sightings. On the same day as the press conference mentioned by Lieser, when General Samford told the public that it was all natural phenomena, the FBI was told by Air Force intelligence that 3% of the sightings couldn't be explained and that \"....it is not entirely impossible that the objects sighted may possibly be from another planet...\" If the General had said this at the press conference the UFO phenomenon probably would have been treated very differently (see the above book for further details and documents never before published). Bruce Maccabee Reflections rejected To the Editor, In the April issue of The MUFON UFO Journal, so-called photoanalyst Mr. Jeff Saino again expressed his opinion that the photos of airborne objects we in- cluded in our July, 1999, Journal article were light re- flections. To enhance his second opinion, Mr. Saino took his own photographs of reflections from automo- biles, rather than examine OUR original photographs. This will be our last response to Mr. Saino's rebut- tal, noting that he displays a serious flaw in his tech- nique as a photo analyst: He has never examined the original images. We have invited Mr. Saino to look at these images, but he has chosen not to. This is incom- prehensible and shows poor technique as an investiga- tor. In contrast, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, a world class expert in ufological image analysis, did indeed con- sider the photographic evidence sent to him as a re- viewer of the article we published in July. Mr. Saino states that \"In arguing that the object 'blinked out' rather than merely angling a reflection away from the witnesses, Schmidt states that after a reflection ended, the reflection source would still be present and identifiable... it was not... Again no sub-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 May 2000 MUFON UFO Journal stantiation of this statement is given.\" Our observa- tion is that Mr. Saino is so blinded by his agenda that he chooses to forget this clear comment within our ar- ticle: \"In addition, Mr. Fisher could no longer see the 'plane' in his binoculars after it quickly disappeared from view. If a reflection had been present, Mr. Fisher would have seen the 'plane' when the reflection ended. He did not.\" And there you have our substantiation for believing that we observed a solid object transform itself into invisibility-as many other witnesses have observed dur- ing a ufological event. \"Blinking out\" is a well-known activity reported for unidentified flying objects. Nicholas F. Schmidt, Ph.D. Gregg Fisher Abductee victim mentality unacceptable In August, 1998, my book, How to Defend Yourself Against Alien Abduction, was published. For a year afterward, and continuing full speed today, the book is receiving publicity on radio and TV and has been re- viewed favorably in numerous UFO and parapsycho- logical journals, as well as newstand magazines. In spite of the fact that the new concepts presented in the book are of supreme importance to the UFO and psychic research fields, certain influential individuals in the UFO field have remained strangely silent. During a magic 21/2 hours with Art Bell on \"Coast to Coast,\" I fielded intelligent questions from numer- ous listeners, and have been invited to appear on \"Dreamland\" with Whitley Strieber. All this demon- strates the interest in the subject of \"resisters\" who successfully tell the abduction phenomenon, whatever or whoever it is, to go away and quit bothering them. Many other abduction researchers have sent letters of encouragement, and my data base of \"resisters\" is growing rapidly as many abductees continue to share their experiences. I know that researchers come across resisters, but this information somehow never appears in print. Do these researchers dismiss \"resisters\" because they do not fit in with their own hypotheses? If so, I feel that this attitude might be unscientific. In science, don't we work with all data which comes to us from ratio- nal, honest sources and not try to \"screen\" what is un- acceptable to us? Curious as to why certain researchers have been ig- noring the new concept and message in HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF, I recently sent friendly letters, copies of the book, and related bio/resume/biblio- graphical material to four of those who had been so silent, with a simple request for feedback and input. None responded. Their silence was so deafening that it allowed valuable insight to seep into my brain, in- formation which seemed so startling that I feel impelled to share it with you. Namely: certain factors in the UFO field apparently do not want instances of successful resistance to come out; if they ignore the book and its new concept, they will not be tempted to try to instruct their traumatized abductees in resistance methods. Apparently they do not believe that resistance works and don't want others to even consider it. Or they might sincerely believe that experiencers have no right to re- sist. What else would prevent researchers from learn- ing vital, new information about a phenomenon on which they have spent decades of work? All of these \"silent\" researchers I refer to are Ameri- cans working mainly with American abductees. Do they feel that the abduction phenomenon is so over- powering that it is able to overthrow the principles of freedom on which this country was founded? The theories put forth by top profile abduction re- searchers, among others, are conspicuously contradic- tory, but they do not seem to recognize this among themselves. There is a \"oneness\" among them, which is difficult to understand. Some of them theorize (or are actually convinced) that \"extraterrestrial\" creatures are hybridizing Americans against their will so that they can take over our planet. Others of these research- ers theorize (or are convinced) that these creatures are somehow responsible, in the great order of things, for evolving the human race and bringing us to a higher order of \"spirituality.\" These gentler thinkers do not explain why the crea- tures first traumatize victims with unpleasant interac- tions, then eventually lead the abductees to \"love\" them. According to this theory, the creatures' painful interference is really \"good\" for the human race, and abductees should go along with it because the crea- tures \"know what is best for us.\" The data is overwhelming that unidentified, possi- bly extraterrestrial, craft seem to be monitoring man- kind. These demonstrably physical UFOs reported by credible witnesses constitute a serious scientific ques- tion which has regrettably been covered up by govern- ments and ignored by official Science. However, in my considered opinion, UFO phenom- ena can be separated into two separate groups. Craft-like UFOs which are caught on radar, chased by jet pilots, and sometimes photographed appear to be physical in our earth's space-time, but in these cases little or no interaction with occupants is noted. So-called \"alien abductions,\" on the other hand, gen- erally take place in altered states of consciousness and are retrieved in large part through hypnotic regression. Claims of \"genetic manipulation,\" \"missing fetuses,\" \"implants,\" and \"\"alien-military cooperation\" lack"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2000 Page 13 solid, scientific proof of extraterrestrial involvement, although I concede that some \"implants,\" \"scars,\" and the like might be due to the creatures' ability to mate- rialize temporarily into our space-time. But the proliferation and escalation of abduction claims seems caused by (1) telepathic leakage during hypnosis between witnesses and hypnotist/researchers, and (2) psychological deception by the phenomenon itself. The logical question to all this is: why is this trauma necessary? If these creatures are really \"in charge of us,\" why don't they approach us with kind logic from the beginning? \"Alien abduction scenarios\" are basi- cally the same as rape and other criminal attacks. The fact that they take place in an altered state of consciousness (which seems to be physical reality, but in essence is not) does not matter here. Abduction sce- narios are very real to the experiencers; they consti- tute a type of altered reality, the effects of which ex- tends into their physical lives. The nine resistance techniques described in How to Defend Yourself Against Alien Abduction enable trau- matized experiencers to break the altered state of con- sciousness in which the abduction scenarios occur. Once the altered state is broken and the person returns to full waking consciousness, the creatures vanish and the scenarios end. I present a working hypothesis to explain this. These witnesses are possibly interacting with interdimensional beings which have been described in philosophical, historical and religious writings, and in folklore and legend, from every major culture of the world. These beings reportedly delight in harassing and deceiving human beings, often in a sexual manner, specific examples being the \"jinns\" described in the Koran, the Sidhe of Celtic cultures, the incubi of Eu- rope, and the \"Old Hag\" in Newfoundland. They are known by different names in differing languages. They are described in Malaysia and Indonesia, in Iceland, by the aborigines of Australia, and by various Native American tribes. These creatures reported in folklore, legends, and in present-day accounts have at least eight character- istics in common with our so-called \"UFO alien ab- ductor.\" All of them reportedly 1. materialize and de-materialize; 2, harass human beings, frequently in a sexual manner; 3. reportedly \"steal\" human babies and/or unborn fetuses; 4. distort the witnesses' per- ception of time; 5. pass through solid matter; 6. enter temporarily into earth space-time, sometimes leaving physical traces; 7. shape-shift into various forms and sizes, including at times animals; and 8. exist normally on a \"hidden\" plane or, to use a modern phrase, \"an- other dimension.\" All the cultures above have developed means to re- sist these creatures, and many of their techniques are very similar or identical to techniques used by the seventy-two resisters described in my book. Adequate attention should be given to the concept of successful resistance. \"Resisters\" are able to live happy, productive lives, free of the trauma and effects of their prior experiences. The concept of resistance is spreading: several research sources speak about it on the Internet, and letters from researchers who teach resistance techniques are passing over my desk. I would hope that the subject will be further addressed in this journal. Ann Druffel \\ FOIA useless? Dwight: U.S. District Judge Stephen McNamee, in an opin- ion issued in the final week of March 2000, concluded that \"the government has conducted a reasonable search regarding information on specific aerial modes of trans- portation. A fruitless search is immaterial if Defen- dant can establish that it conducted a search reason- ably calculated to uncover all relevant documents re- quested by Plaintiff.\" Thus, Judge McNamee dismissed the FOIA suit brought by Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) against the Department of Defense concerning the \"Phoenix Lights\" incident. And with it, the public was told once again, that the awesome resources of U.S. Government agencies somehow, ignorantly, failed to communicate the fundamentals of what hundreds of ordinary people saw plainly overhead. The lesson for MUFON and all who pay attention to UFO events is that the Freedom of Information Act as constructed does not work-will never work-in terms ^of UFO. documentation. For we are collectively ask- ing fairness and openness of military intelligence agen- cies which, from some apparent directive above the reach of the Congress, is not inclined to be fair and open. The officials of those bodies, across decades and numerous administrations, have never wavered from the principle that the public does not have a right to know. MUFON therefore has a choice: We can continue to lend our support to FOIA enthusiasts who beat on a door that will never be opened, or we can channel our efforts in a quieter, sustained effort to win the confi- dence of federal and state officials in pursuit of the truth.

Avon Books: New York. 1998. 5X8 paper cover. 419 pages. $15.00. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Good, of course, needs no introduction. As one of the best-known English authors, he has also written Alien Update, The UFO Report, Alien Contact, and Above Top Secret. As a long-time ufologist, he has the perspective nec- essary to understand what is important and how the past and present are related. Though, like the rest of us, he occasionally has to retreat from an idea or opin- ion, his batting average is respectible. It should be pointed out that the name of the book is misleading, as Good has pointed out to me. \"It is not my title,\" he emphasizes. While there is quite a bit of material regarding alleged alien bases, the majority of the book covers just about everything in ufology. The publishers choose titles that they feel will sell a book (and which start with a letter high in the alphabet), rather than selecting titles that represent what the book is about. This is common enough that we are all now wary of titles, but it still causes problems, as with this book. The strength of Alien Bases comes from Good's abil- ity to bring diverse cases together in a reasonably co- herent fashion. This sets it apart somewhat from those books that simply relate case after case, either chrono- logically or by category, although even Alien Bases would have benefited from more comparisons, better organization, more detail, and fewer cases. One interesting example of tying diverse elements together is the 1943 case of Daniel Leger, who report- edly had an encounter in Poland with a blonde woman who was attempting to free a metallic saucer-like ob- ject from a sand dune. One part of this account by Leger seemed especially questionable: the woman re- portedly entered the object and sprawled \"on all fours\" in a stretched position in the middle of the floor (as if driving a motorbike in competition) before taking off in the object. Good compares this strange scenario to a 1954 case from the U.S.' In this encounter an unnamed Ameri- can technician supposedly describes observing a UFO land in the middle of the airfield at a military helicop- ter base. The technician and others reportedly ran to- ward it, but became immobilized until \"a stranger\" near the craft left in a cigar-shaped object. Then the group reportedly continued forward to examine the object, eventually utilizing a welding torch to cut into the ob- ject, according to the technician. The interior layout suggested that the \"pilot\" in this object had also been traveling on all fours. Although this latter case should have had more documentation, it does illustrate the principle of tying cases together. Good discusses the well-investigated 1964 New Berlin, NY, four-hour UFO repair case (one which I reported many years ago in SkylooK) and other simi- lar repair cases. His comments concerning this as- pect of ufology are food for thought: \"So conditioned are we to the notion of alien omnipotence and the perfection of their technology that when something goes wrong, as reported in a number of cases, we are inclined to doubt, or to wonder if the event was staged as part of an elaborate deception.\" Some ufologists, not including Good, would argue that UFOs cannot crash, since they must be extremely sophisticated to reach Earth from wherever they origi- nate. The repair cases seem to indicate that not all UFOs are mechanically perfect. It might also be ap- ropos to recall that we have been able to reach Mars, only to have our own problems after getting there. Many interesting cases are included in this 419- page book-as well as a 16-page section of photos. There are cases that are widely known, and there are accounts that are new or less familiar. In comment- ing on these, Good is open-minded without being overly gullible. His treatment of contactees, including the well- known George Adamski, is even-handed as he joins some other serious ufologists in taking a new look at some contactees who were summarily dismissed a few years ago. This new attitude seems to be a natural extension of greater acceptance of abduction cases: if there are abductions, the reasoning goes, then it is logical that there are also contactees. Good analyses the claims of Adamski by evaluat- ing his photos of UFOs, as well as his descriptions of encounters with the space entities, making compari- sons with newer scientific discoveries . Overall, one gets the impression that Good feels the evidence in- dicates a reasonable possibility that Adamski did have contacts, but perhaps eventually fell prey to exaggera- tion. The 14-page index is helpful in finding individu- als and topics, although it is not totally comprehen- sive. There is, for example, no listing of the \"repair cases\" noted above. As one would expect, the index does include an extensive list of alien bases, by both topic and geographic area (with Puerto Rico having the greatest number of listings). While Alien Bases seems to lack a theme (despite its title), and plows little new ground, it has enough merit to be included in the library of the serious ufologist."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2000 Page 15 The Field Guide to UFOs by Dennis Stacy and Patrick Huyghe, illustrated by Harry Trumbore; Harper-Collins (Quill), 10 E. 53rd St., New York, NY 10022; 5X8 paperback, 180 pages, $13.00. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This nicely done guide by writers who know what they are doing is one in a series of being written by Huyghe and co-authors which deal with various top- ics, including Bigfoot, extraterrestrials, and ghosts. The main feature of this book is the classification of UFO shapes, divided into eight types: lightform, spheri- cal, discoid, elliptical, cylindrical, rectangular, trian- gular, and shape-shifters. These eight types are sub- divided into a total of 42 variants, such as \"disc w;th fins\" under the discoid type. Each of these is matched with a specific UFO case, and each is nicely illustrated. Stacy and Huyghe feel that this classification system will encompass more than 99 percent of all UFO sightings. The authors provide a brief history of UFO obser- vations, discuss the problems of human observations, and come to certain conclusions regarding shapes. They find, for example, that there are \"certain connec- tions\" between an object's size and shape, i.e. the larger the UFO is, the more likely it is to be shaped like a cigar, flying wing, or triangle. They also suggest that there is a correlation between shape and behavior, i.e. \"wings and triangles seem to be a solitary phenom- enon, rarely accompanied by smaller UFOs.\" Large UFOs are seldom seen on the ground, while the clas- sic disc is often seen close up and on the ground, with some sort of support often reported. Stacy and Huyghe note that shapes seem to become \"fashionable\" during certain periods of time, \"only to be overshadowed months or years later by an entirely different one.\" They also note that, \"In many if not most instances, no UFO is seen from an outside per- spective at all\" in abduction cases. While this may be true, we probably have the opposite impression, based on the more famous abduction cases (Walton, Hill, Cahill, Pascaghoula, etc.) where the outside is de- scribed. The authors look at physical evidence left by UFOs, such as radar, photos, and physical traces, concluding that research by Ted Phillips and others is valuable, but that physical evidence \"will always be haunted by the specter of human hoaxing. As anyone who has closely followed the history of crop circle phenom- enon is forced to admit, the evidence is now almost overwhelming that they are the product of human hoax- ers.\" Apparently the authors are not impressed with the extensive work done by Levengood and associates which indicates that many of the crop circles could not have been done by hoaxers. Also covered in the book is a listing of UFO \"hot spots,\" ranging from Gulf Breeze, FL, to Yakima, WA. Ultimately, the book's value has to rest on the cat- egorizing of UFO shapes, and the authors do a fine job in organizing and illustrating the 42 variants.

Peterson, Ave., Chicago, IL 60659; 6X9,115 pages, $21.00: Reviewed by Dwight Connelly We have come to expect valuable scholarly articles from these CUFOS volumes, and this one does not dis- appoint. Perhaps the most discussed (or cussed) article in this volume will be Thomas E. Bullard's 25-page discourse on \"Abductions Under Fire: A Review of Recent Ab- duction Literature.\" A better designation would be \"anti-abduction literature,\" since all three books re- viewed feature anti-abduction themes: Peter Brookesmith's Alien Abductions; Terry Matheson's Alien Abductions: Creating a Modern Phenomenon; and Kevin D. Randle, Rus Estes, and William P. Cone's The Abduction Enigma. The most surprising part of these reviews is Bullard's fascination with the Randle book. Although he ably points out many of the book's serious flaws, he con- cludes by saying, \"As it stands, this book performs fu- neral rites for abduction in any literal terms,\" and \"with- out a doubt the status quo is dead.\" As readers of my review of the Randle book in the April MUFON UFO Journal know, my conclusion regarding this book is far different. Phil Klass in his March issue of Skeptics UFO News- letter makes much of Bullard's review, stating, \"It may become more difficult for MUFON, CAUS, Filer's Files and leading 'abductionists,' such as Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs and Dr. Mack, to continue to publicly ignore the new book.\" Other features of New Series Vol. 7 include \"Geo- physical Parameters and UFO Sighting Frequencies\" by Edward J.

Filer, Director, Mutual UFO Network Eastern Region Another new Roswell witness? The individual narrating the following account has requested that his name not be released at this time. \"I was at Roswell in 1947 to early 1950. I was at the time a gunner in the 393rd Bomb Squadron, 509th Bomb Group, and a member of Captain Frederick Ewing's B-29 combat crew with tail number 44-7301 (Straight Flush). \"On Wednesday, July 9,1947, our crew transported a crate to Carswell Army Air Force Base, Fort Worth, Texas in 1:55 minutes. The mission and cargo was classified. The crate was hauled in the front bomb bay, and armed guards rode in that bomb bay with the crate. When I removed the down lock, I saw a major and a technical sergeant in the bomb bay and some others in there.. They rode the whole trip in the bomb bay and did not return with us. \"We flew unpressurized at about 8,000 feet. Our bombardier made a safety check of the shackles which held the platform secure. Those shackles were rigged so that the cargo could not be jettisoned. The corpo- ral tail gunner and I saw the crate when we removed the down locks from the bomb doors. The crate was covered with a tarp when unloaded and taken away on a trailer at Carswell. I would guess the crate was about 12x6x6 feet. \"The engineer and I talked about weight and bal- ance. They evidently had not given him a firm figure on the weight. He said with a laugh, \"As long as it isn't more than five thousand pounds, our center of gravity should be okay.\" We knew that Ft. Worth was to be our landing point, and we might get to see the new B-36 bomber. Someone made a remark about car- rying \"The General's Furniture.\" There had also been rumors for a couple of days about a spaceship crash, but we were only told it was classified cargo and to stay back. \"On the way home, I went forward to chat with War- rant Officer Landry about a minor problem with a prop. We had the Curtiss Electric's, and there was concern that one of them was hunting a bit. \"Major Jessie Marcel rode back to Roswell with us, and I talked briefly with him. He was always inter- ested in the enlisted men on flight crews. He wanted gunners to be good observers when on long missions. I don't think his questions that day were probing. We were useful mostly as scanners because we had only tail guns. He asked if I was anxious to get into B-36's. \"We were told repeatedly not to talk of this inci- dent, not even to our wives. I held that inside until 1988 when books began to appear. To .this day I am in touch with one other member of our crew. Most of the others are no longer alive. Major Ewing was killed in a B-47 crash in Florida in 1952. \"Sometime afterwards, about three to six months later, the wives began talking among themselves about the cleanup detail. This originated from the wives of men on that duty. One such was a neighbor of ours in July 1947. They moved across town, but I would some- times see him and I ask him what he had seen out there. He was upset and told me, \"You don't want to know.\" I think he was a baker because he would leave for work in the early morning, like 0130 hours. A time or two when I'd come in from a late flight and he would be standing on the corner waiting for a ride. They did not own a car. Based on the wives gossip we heard that he had seen a body. \"Later, I became a pilot, and while in SAC was an instructor in the Aero-clubs and moonlighting as a crop duster. Aviation has been my life. While in SAC KC- 97's at March AFB our crew had two weird experi- ences with something that officially wasn't there. You may put the story in your Filer's Files.

Davenport, Director of the National Reporting Center, sent this sighting report. On April 1,2000,96 miles northwest of Dallas a com- puter salesman and his girlfriend observed a very bright light move towards them as they traveled south on Highway 16: \"Suddenly an extremely bright light was shining off to our left. The light was behind some trees, but was blinding me. It rose in the air and headed straight for our car as we traveled at 65 mph. As it got to about 300 yards away we both said, 'What is that?' I could see that there was a cockpit or something under this huge black shape. The cockpit was shining an incred- ibly bright light with some pulsating bands of red lights. \"The object approached and flew directly over the car. It easily matched our 65 mph speed and my friend looked up and sort of gasped. She said that the lights were alternating. As it traveled southwest off to some low hills it disappeared. We both saw the same craft. \"When we got back to the cabin in 30 minutes we took out some paper and drew sketches of what we saw. The drawings matched! We called the Sheriff s office in Graham and asked about aircraft or helicop- ters? He called the local small airport and they had nothing up. \"On Monday I called Carswell AFB and the DFW control center and they had nothing out that way at that time. A trucker may have also seen the same ob- ject.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport for sending this re- port. http://www.UFOcenter.com Object frightens Colorado woman On Tuesday, March 7,2000, between 9 and 10 p.m., a woman was driving on a back road near Olathe, CO (population 1,300). Sitting beside her in the car's front seat was the woman's baby, who was just under one year old. She reported \"an encounter with a low-flying aerial craft,\" according to ufologist Davina Ryszka of Montrose, CO. (MUFON State Section Director) The craft/object exhibited a very bright white light and had red and green lights on its sides. The woman reported that the UFO \"appeared to be confrontational.\" As the object approached her car head-on, at first the witness thought it was a low-flying airplane, and slammed on the brakes to try to avoid what seemed would be an inevitable crash, said Ryszka. The aircraft stopped right in front of her car, and when she tried to move, it moved. When she attempted to turn the car around and go back the way she came, it moved in'front of her car. At this point she was \"really frightened,\" especially because she had a small baby in the car seat. Finally, she managed to get in front of the object, and it ended up behind her, and she could see it in the rear-view mirror. Then, for a time, it was not visible at all, and she was relieved that it might be gone. Suddenly, a bright light came on directly above her, illuminating her car and the surrounding area. She drove quickly on to Olathe, understandably shaken. Oklahoma family reports gaining time NEW MEXICO â Brent W. writes, \"Consider me highly skeptical of almost all UFO reports, but my entire family and I have experienced two unsettling occasions of not losing time, but actually GAINING time. On a trip through New Mexico, we decided to de- tour to Clayton Lake to see the dinosaur footprints. The drive was a winding up and down road of 16 miles and it took nearly 25 minutes to negotiate. On our return trip we turned back toward town, drove two miles to the base of a hill, went up around the hill in a sweeping turn, and suddenly found ourselves back at the highway where we had started from.' We tried to make sense of it as we continued on our journey, but, there were no side roads to take an acci- dental shortcut. There was only a tall mountain that blocked our way, but we came out at the exact spot where we had started. Less than five minutes elapsed for the 16 miles covered and we had noticed the dif- ferent, landmarks on the way back. At another time, we were traveling from Tulsa to Oklahoma City on the Turner Turnpike, a straight 88- mile toll road between the two cities. It was after 10 p.m., and we had stopped at McDonalds for a snack. While we were waiting, we asked our daughter what time she had, since we had given her a new watch and she was learning to tell time. We jokingly made a comment about the accuracy of our timepieces on Cen- tral Daylight Time because the car clock read 10:20 p., my watch 10:18 p.m., and my daughter's 10:16 p.m.. Each was off by two minutes. We left McDonalds and joined the turnpike on what turned out to be the strangest night I have ever en- countered. My wife became hysterical when she saw a bright light in the sky. As a former pilot, the light was easily identifiable to me as a commercial airliner on a standard approach path, but her reaction was to- tally out of character for her. None of us remembered very much of the trip, be- cause we were sandwiched between two large trucks. We came over a hill and were shocked to see the toll- booth at the halfway point. It was impossible, but there it was. We had traveled 42 miles in an elapsed time of 16 minutes. We all checked the clocks and watches and the results were shocking. We had averaged 157.5"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2000 Page 19 mph, which is of course impossible for our car and the speed limit of 75mph. We talked about this at length, remembering the previous Clayton Lake anomaly. The last 46 miles were uneventful, and we arrived home ahead of the expected time by nearly 20 minutes. We used a quar- ter tank of gas less than the drive should have taken. Two experiences with one of them timed by three different timepieces. Somehow we either gained time or distance (a hypothetical possibility based on the gas consumption). We are highly skeptical people, but perplexed! Thanks to Brent W. crowkiller06@hotmail.com. County, NY TroyCarm Connecticut phenomena investigated Mark Cashman, MUFON CT State Director, reports that on Dec. 13, 1999, at 3:30 p.m. four witnesses ob- served two anomalous phenomena for a total of 40 minutes. The witnesses were two adult business own- ers, 49 (Y) and 51 (F), his son 12, and a woman busi- ness associate (W) 80. The observations are broken into two phases. An estimated five contrails were observed in se- quence descending toward a ridge to the west. These contrails became visible in each case after a bright star- like light appeared, and were the width of the light, and once reaching a specific length retained that length without change. Each contrail displayed a \"puff about halfway to the hill that acted as the horizon. The witnesses also thought there was an orange flash as each light passed below the tree-line. One contrail split into two. The witnesses believed it was possible that the lights crashed on the hill, though they heard no sound. The contrails dissolved, including the puffs. They observed two solid objects, gray in color, one \"bullet-shaped\" with smoothly faired fins, and one spherical with no seams or protrusions. One witness observed an apparent seam on the bullet-shaped ob- ject. The objects, of large angular size (3 inches at two feet), passed the witnesses at a relatively close dis- tance, and as they moved to the north vanished in full view. The location of the second phase was about thirty feet to the east of the first at 41.81120 (Lat.), -72.92348 (Long). A third \"phase\" was the observation of a number of aircraft identified as commercial Short Skyvans be- lieved looking for what they had just observed. The two adult men seemed credible and articulate, but per- plexed by the event. The child offered a reasonable level of corroboration. A more detailed analysis can be found at mcashman@temporaldoorway.com: Thanks to: Mark Cashman. Canada object a fast mover YUKON-Martin Jasek, who wrote the lead article in the February MUFON UFO Journal regarding the giant Yukon UFO, reports that on March 30, 2000, a man, a woman and a young boy were traveling along the Klondike Highway from Whitehorse to the Vil- lage of Pelly Crossing, at 5 a.m. The sky was clear with a glow of predawn blue. They were nearing the end of Little Fox Lake and came around a sharp right- hand bend near the base of a mountain. Upon coming out from the bend they saw at 300 feet away a 35-foot diameter saucer, hovering about 200 feet off the ground! They observed it to be sta- tionary on their right for five seconds, and then it shot across the road in front of their truck at \"incredible speed,\" stopping instantly on the left side of the road. One of the witnesses said, \"Nothing can move that fast, in the blink of an eye!\" It remained motionless for only another split sec- ond and shot off even faster, performing a 90-degree turn and shooting off behind them. One witness thought it went right into the side of a mountain, while the other thought it followed the mountainous skyline. \"The passenger said, \"Come on, floor it!\" They eventually pulled over about 20 minutes later and both were shaking. \"We were more scared than excited! It's like we caught it by surprise when we came around the corner. It was so advanced! I'll never be the same!\" The saucer was a classic disc shape with a dome on top. The dome had two curved windows or lights from which a beautiful ocean blue or aqua colored light was shining. The surface of the craft was \"mirror like, sil- ver, translucent, shiny, glassy, reflecting the color of the sky. It was as though the UFO was trying to \"cam- ouflage against the background sky color. Had it been pitch black out I don't think we would have seen the body of the craft, just the windows or lights\" the woman remarked. As the UFO streaked in front of their vehicle, the car headlights dimmed and their tape deck stopped playing. They both wanted to check the time of their sighting. However, the woman's battery-operated ana- log watch had stopped at 5 a.m., and the man's digital watch got stuck in chrono mode. Other than the initial power drain, no additional problems were noted with the truck. They managed to get the watches functioning after 5 minutes and the tape deck started to work in 10 min- utes. No noise was heard emanating from the UFO. It was about 1 hour and 35 minutes before sunrise.

Kelly Cahill made an im- pressive and convincing wit- ness at least year's sympo- sium, and comes highly rec- ommended by colleagues in Australia, who are not known for being \"soft on abductions.\" Speaking of which, Kevin Randle and his colleagues ob- viously are highly dismissive of the entire phenomenon. Not having read the book, I cannot assess their logic and reason- ing in any detail. But based on my own experience and Dwight Connelly's review, I could not disagree more with their conclusions. In my interviews with 150 or more abductees, I found no such pattern as they report of sexual or gender prob- lems. I can't help but wonder how they selected their sample. The reported argument-from-hypnosis always bothers me, since I never have used hypnosis, but I still get exactly the same report elements as those who do. \" I definitely did not \"lead\" the witnesses, as tape re- cordings of the sessions clearly show. If the abduction data ONLY came from hypnosis, the authors would have a point. In fact, according to the review, this book apparently uses the same tired old arguments and ad hoc type of reasoning so commonly used by debunk- ers. Connelly's review says it better than I can here. I agree with him that many of the most famous ab- duction cases also fail to support the thesis being ad- vanced, again raising the important methodological question of how they chose their sample and derived their statistics. If 60% of abduction cases emerged only under hypnosis, does that disqualify the 40% that did not? Even if the authors' seemingly off-the-wall claim that 90% of abductees are sexually dysfunctional were true, I'm not sure what it would prove. Maybe that sexu- ally dysfunctional people are braver (or dumber) than the average person about talking to debunkers. It could even be evidence that sexual tinkering by aliens has caused sexual dysfunction in abductees! One suspects that the authors are engaging in circular reasoning; it can't be true, therefore it isn't. In fact, someone should translate that expression into Latin and assign it as the CSICOP credo. The 1970 airline pilot radar-visual sighting is an important one to get on record, and suggests (along with many other hints) that dozens, if not hundreds, of pilot sightings go unreported. A very valuable project underway by Dominique Weinstein in Paris, France, is an effort to record and document all pilot sightings since the beginning of the UFO mystery. The UFO Evidence: Volume II (in press) also contains a strong section on pilot sightings, many of them not generally known, including quite a few provided by Dr. Rich- ard F. Haines from direct questioning of the witnesses. The triangular object reported by William I. McNeff seems very unlikely to have been any kind of conven- tional aircraft for several reasons. Anything that was the estimated angular size of a hand (even a relatively small female hand) at arm's length would have been quite close to the witness (or impossibly large), so that you could have \"counted the rivets.\" It would have been clearly identifiable as an aircraft. (I am writing this column based on page proofs, and have not seen the sketch.) Even with car windows closed and air conditioner on, any known aircraft that low or moving that slowly would have made itself heard by its very loud roar. Any object that large and moving slowly is not en- gaged in aerodynamic flight as we know it. Soundless craft spooks English couple ENGLAND-MUFON'S Keith Midgen reports a sighting in the county of West Sussex during the sum- mer of 1972. Tim Sander and a companion were in a parked car on an unlit country road facing an open farmer's field at the edge of North Bersted, a small village located between Bognor Regis and Chichester. Around 10:30 p.m., on a clear night with light cloud cover, the two of them looked through the windshield of the car and saw some bright white lights, at least three, heading slowly towards them, roughly 150 feet off the ground. Tim assumed the configuration was a helicopter but thought it strange that a helicopter would be in this location at this time of night. At a distance of about 300 feet from the car, the lights, which remained equidistant to each other, be- gan to descend slowly, but because it was a very dark night and the lights were bright, Tim and his compan- ion could not see the shape of the craft. As it got closer to the ground, the two realized that the craft made no sound at all. They observed the craft for another 30 seconds or so, but then hurriedly drove away."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal May 2000 Page 21 MUFON MERCHANDISE Wear official MUFON T-Shirts (royal blue printing on white cot- ton), sizes: S, M, L & XL.

Just above the Triangle's brightest luminary Vega is the \"Keystone of Hercules,\" the center of the Greek hero constellation. The Keystone is a 4-sided, wedge-shaped box of faint stars, noteworthy for an object located along the W side of the wedge. Under perfect viewing conditions, the object is barely visible to the naked eye as a small dim spot of light. Tele- scopes of increasing size resolve this little patch into stars, more and more of them-in fact, more than 100,000 stars packed into a vast globular cluster known as the Hercules Cluster. Since globular star clusters encircle the outskirts of our galactic home in the uni- verse, the Milky Way Galaxy, these objects have helped determine the shape and size of the galaxy. The Her- cules Cluster is 21,000 light-years distant. Scorpius, the little arachnid that stung mighty Orion on the foot causing his death, has begun its summer sojourn across the southern horizon.

(As the old song says, \"See you in Saint Loueee.\") Letter from Dale P. Pequignot \"Just a quick note. I've noted your concerns about losing Journal subscribers to the Internet and other competition. I, too, travel the Internet, but I find mate- rial on the Internet to be inconsistent and lacking in depth. Plus, I can't sit all night staring at a bright TV monitor. \"I find MUFON's Journal to be solid, consistent, and timely. In addition, it is not loaded with busy graph- ics and little 'alien' faces. The MUFON UFO Journal is an accessible hard copy that sits on my bookshelf. I can reference it any time I need to. \"For me, the MUFON UFO Journal and CUFOS' IUR are well worth the subscription fees. They both provide solid articles while avoiding the color and flash that dominate the newsstand magazines.\" Reduced Prices for Symposium Proceedings If you have been trying to add a majority of the past years' symposium proceedings to your library, here is the opportunity you have been waiting for. Due to the fact that we are moving the MUFON headquarters to the Denver, CO, area, we have elected to sell the most recent proceedings at a five-dollar discount to reduce the cost of shipping the stock to Denver. Symposium proceedings from the years 1991 through 1994 will now sell for $15, and those from 1995 through 1999 will be $20. The shipping and han- dling charges will remain the same as on the MUFON Publication List: the first book in the U.S. is $1.75, and each additional book is one dollar. For foreign or- ders the first book is $2.75, and each additional book is $2.00. This special price has been extended to June 1, 2000, due to popular demand. Order now while it is fresh in your mind. National UFO Information Week The week of Saturday, August 12 to Sunday, Au- gust 20, 2000 has been designated as National UFO Information Week. Please contact your shopping mall or public library to reserve space for your UFO exhibit and UFO information distribution."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 May 2000 MUFON UFO Journal Walter Andrus NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK New Officers Andreas Lueck Ph.D., a Consultant in Biology, previously from Arlington, MA, has accepted the ad- ditional position of Representative for Netherlands-Antilles in South America. Dr. Lueck is at the Saba University of Medicine in Saba. With the passing of Mrs. Mildred M. Biesele (Salt Lake City) a vacancy has been created for the position of Utah State Director. The new Co-State Directors for Utah will be Elaine Douglass and Ron S. Regehr of Moab, UT. Elaine is the former State Director for the District of Columbia and both are Co-State Sec- tion Directors for four counties in Southeastern Utah. We will be seeking an Assistant State Director for the Salt Lake City area. Michael E. Buxton (Lincoln) is the new State Sec- tion Director for Penabscot County in Maine. Joseph R. Burkes M.D. (Los Angeles, CA) became a new Consultant in Medicine. Field Investigator Exams Passed Four members passed the Field Investigator's Exam this past month. They are Dawn A. Vohsen (Mary- land Heights, MO); Janese Thatcher-Buzzell, M.A. (St. Hilaire, MN); William J. Konkolesky, B.S. (Royal Oak, MI); and Donald H. Dailey, M.S. (Georgetown, IN). Each member received a MUFON lapel pin as a token of their accomplishment. MUFON's Thirty-first Anniversary On May 31, 2000, the Mutual UFO Network will celebrate its thirty-first anniversary. We should all be proud of our accomplishments. No other UFO mem- bership organization in history has had such an envi- able record or length of service. Gender Membership Survey Due to the enthusiastic response of female mem- bers, we conducted a survey to determine the gender of our membership. This included family members where both husband and wife are subscribers to the Journal. Women constituted exactly 33% of our mem- bership, whereas men ran 66%. (In analysing the en- tire membership in our computer, there were 39 people who used only their initials; therefore we were unable to determine the gender of this 1%.) MUFON recognizes the outstanding contributions that women have brought to our organization, includ- ing presentations at the annual symposia, and women have become more involved in other aspects of our work as well, including a high percentage of our State and State Section Directors leadership roles being filled by women. Since a greater number of men have in the past been educated and employed in the scientific and engineering fields, the percentage of males in MUFON reflects this fact, but this is quickly changing as women move into these fields in greater numbers. Press Conference on UFO Ballot Initiative Bruce A. Widaman, Missouri State Director, held a press conference on March 15, 2000, at the Sheraton Westport Hotel to announce that the State of Missouri had accepted and approved the wording of the UFO Ballot Initiative. Obtaining 80,000 signatures before the May deadline date is going to be a very difficult task, but this has been a moral victory in the \"Show-Me-State,\" because it has set the stage and pro- vided the incentive to the other fifteen states which honor the ballot initiative referendum. Congratulations to Larry W. Bryant, Bruce A. Widaman, and Robert H. Bletchman for their accom- plishment and persistence. Since it is highly improb- able that sufficient signatures can be obtained at this time, the Missouri referendum will become a challenge at the next statewide election. UFO Sighting Reports A radical improvement in the lead articles published in the monthly Journal was noted starting with De- cember 1999. This has been due to the fact that our State/Provincial Directors, State Section Directors, and Consultants are writing narrative reports of their UFO investigations and submitting them to the International Director for publication. I know that there are many other outstanding reports that are only getting exposure in the pages of MUFON State and Chapter publications. This is an invitation to (Continued on Page 23)"}]
