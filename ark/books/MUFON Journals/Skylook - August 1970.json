A group of from 15 to 30 red and green lights in a geometric patter! were moving just over the tree tops to the right of the car. Suddenly a , the lights stopped, and three brilliant white search lights came on for a minute or two, and the observers could see a country home under the lights. As the \"search lightstr went off, the object moved east, then south, being under observation for four or five minutes, The object when first seen seemed to be flying almost parallel to the road in an easterly direction at about 30 MPH. It stopped directly above the home of Grady E. Davis, on the south side of Heats Bridge Road, about $ mile west of the bridge. Then the object flew east for a blbkk,then southeasterly toward the lake, and finally southwesterly ,u over the lake channel, toward the city, at a high rate of speed, Kramer said the red and green lights spanned a distance of about 20 feet, and the white lights a distance of 12 feet. He described ths red and green lights as acorn shaped and in a double layer, alternat-. . ing red and green with a red light between-two green lights, an'd c~p- osite a green light, thus forming a defnite pattern. They seemed to be mounted on a frame rather than a solid body, as the observers fe'.;) the>- could always see all of the lights, none ever seeming to be blockz4 out by any solid structure. The colored liphts were suspended, like an acorn with the tip down, and were glowing and translucent, with ng bright spot as a Cilament makes inside an incandescent lampbulb. -he lights did not blink or flash or chage position relative to each other The three brilliant white floodlights were mounted at the level of ti:? lower row of colored lights. Mr. Kramer said they seemed to be 15 tim, briphter thari any carbon arc lamps he had ever seen, and they wera co:-:._ shaped. There are no poles, electric lines, television or radio towers in the Davis home area-that would have served as mounting for the lie!? The light on the Davis home and yard seemed to be brighter than day- light, and Anne Kramer, 15, said she thought you could have seen a needle in the grass, Altho the Krarners came within 100 feet of the lights, they said there was no sound from the object. The Davis family, questioned later, said they were retiring- for the night, with the drapes drawn, and had not noticed the light outside or anything unsual as a possible side effect of the lights. Karen, age 10, said the lights reminded her of a Christmas tree.

On the night of June 18, 1970, the telephone began to ring at rad?o station WCKB, the local newspaper office, 2nd the Dunn Police station as about half a dozen rewidents reported a hrge round lieht moving east. Upon learning of this sighting the North Earolina UFO Report- ing Network re2cted by conducting telephone interviews with three of the principzl witnesses which could be located June 22 and 23. Mrs. Henry Baldwin wzs sitting in h~r yard alone with friends and +el2tives whdn they noticed an object which had appesred in the east, It was a round ball, reddish-orznge in color, and moving northeasto The edges of the object were even and round. It was the size of a saucer or one-fourth the size of the full moon. She said thzt the ob- ject was moving slowcr than an airpl~ne 2nd wes much l~rper than en airpl~ne light. All of the witnesses noticed that the object scened to be.trailing smoke behind it. Though the sighting only lasted a few se'conds, Mrs: Beldwin was frightened and r2n onto the czr port, but by this time'the others informed her thet the object hzd suddenly dis- appeared. The sighting took plzce betu~en 10 and 11 p.m, It w2s betwsen 10 ?nd 11 p.m. when b'irs. Jerry Smith along with Mrs. Dody Warr'en saw the object. They were about a mile somewhzt south of, Dunn on U. S. 421 heading tow~rds Dunn. Suddenly, Mrs. Smith no- ticed an $object in front of them about the height of an airplane. The object was coming tow~rds them and at an angle as if falling in their direction. It was twice as big as 2 cc?r headlight and, much brighter. When thcy rezched a curve in the rosd, the object th~n w2s to their right. Just as they were pulling off the ro~d, Mrs. Smith s~id that the object went out, whereupon smoke went upw~rd from it; For a scqan4 Mrs. Smith saw a couple of little red lights, 2.5. on an airplene, whic5 appeared at ,the point the object seemed to disappear. Mrs. Warren, who w2s driving the automobile, confirmed most of Mrs., Smith's account. However, she stated thzt the object was yeilowish--re3 and the edges appezred blurry; Before it disappezred, she'saw many small lights around it 2nd did not sce the two red lights after it disappeared. She also added thzt, because she w2s drivinp, she could not see it as well as her companion. The er:ti:-e incide~t lasted about on'e minute. Investigator's Remzrks: M~king the ?ss~,xption %h2t both sets of witnesses s2w the ssme ob,ject (notice the siinilzrity in description), we 2re f~ced with two discrepencies: th~t of time and direction, In speaking with the radio station and police stztion, as well ~ls calcu- lating it from additional informtion supplied by Mrs. Wzrren, it scec,,; the time of the incident can be shortcned to between 10 2nd 10:30 p.m, As to direction, this investigator considers it more relieble to con- sider Mrs. Smith 2nd Mrs. Warrens' report th2t it moved from west (probably NW or NNW) to east (probebly SE) besed-on the object's orien- tation to the road whose direction is known. Mrs. Bpldwin is probably in error when she stptes th~t it moved from E to NE. All three wit- nesses admitted that theii-. sense of direction is poor and sonsidering it was at night, this is understzndabl-e. Neither Polk AFB nor Seymour Johnson AFB knew of any airplanes or balloons in the area at that time, The night was clear with a full moon.

The bottom one, v:hich appar- ed to be connected by some sort oi' r~d, was a neon, giowi-ng yellow. Mrs. Luebben said it looked like three iron-bar type appendages wer? on the bottom of the craft, although it did not sit down, but hovered over the area. The object hovered in the area between the Luebbenfs house, which is located on Lu-Roy Lane about six blocks east of highway 60-70-89, and the highway. Lulu said the light was so bright that she could iden+,ify types of vehicles moving on the highway behind the craft, such as a semi-truck, lumber truck etc. After about 15 minutes, the object II~G.J~~ to the other side of the hiphway, and Flrs. Luebben reported that she was sure of this because cars passing on the highway were between :he - f Luebben house and the craft. Altogether, Mrs. Luebben estimated the UFO hovered in the srea a5out 30 minutes, then moved off to the southwest. Although the sighting may sound like science fiction, several other people in the area have seen ob,jects in the sky at nieht with apparent- ly the s?me intense blue light. Hud Hutchison, emnloyed as a security guard at Falcon Field, said he and two other men w,tched an object with the szme type of blue light slowly cross the sky tow~rds Willi3ms AFB. said ~t the time all three men had to reassure each other thst they hadn't been dreaming- Two persons in the Bush Highway area last October sighted an objzct again identifiable by the same blue light, crossing the sky to the west, Mrs. Doris Mathews and Richard Sayers, both of Boston St., just west of Bush, watched that they thought was a brilliant blue falling star suddenly appear to the southwest and cross the sky toward the north. Then, instead of falling as they expected, the blue light suddenly I went out as though it had been extinguished. Once again, both persons had to reassure each other they had actually seen such an object in the sky. Checks with the Pinal County Sheriff's Office and the Arizona High- way Patrolfs %laypool and Phoenix Offices revealed no reports by rnotoi-- ists of sighting unusual lights along the highways around Apache Junc- tion. A check with Williams Air Force Base produced the i~forrnation that Williams had no aircraft operational at the time of Lulu's sightings and that there have been no reported sightings of UFOs within the last six months.

A mysterious crater found in Kar- elia in 1961 is the focal point of the article, as no llnaturall' expla- nation has yet been found to explain it. This is one more indication .that the Russisns are wellawareof the UFO possibility , despite the official pronouncements to the contrary. Demidovls article is well , :.worth reading.

Old Missouri Report-Carried in Air Force Files At approximately 4:30 a.m. on Feb. 9, 1968, the observer was awaken- ed by several of his cows bawling. The observer rushed to his li-vi~~ room and sighted a craft that was estimated to be about 3.00 ft.:>-, 5-1 diameter and had concave sides. A bright yellow-green 1igh.t c,,x frm the concave sides of the craft and the craft itself prcdc?,;:q a ;)l~ls~c.- ing sound similar to a piece of wire whirled at high s~~sd aSsv2 a person's head.

She thought it was ~rob~bly a small plane ownea oy a local resident. But as she prop-&ss9d dovm the road, she grew con- cerned as the \"planen, which now ap~~ared more dirigible-shaped; was coming very quicgy toward her on a collision cocrse.

The silver, egg-shaped craft was possibly as long as a pi er cub, not over ten feet thick and hzd one huge, very bright light 7 yellovVi?h white) on the end facing her. There were no doors or ports or l&iwir.& gear seen. Only a line which appeared to be a seam was seer. apprcx- imately through the longitudinal center of it. The craft began to drift cloakwise very slowly on its lorigitcdi~al axis. As .the other end of the craft came into view, she saw a platfon. about two feet wide. On this platform was a \"nan\" wearing a bulky, white, one-piece, asbestos-looking suit. His hands were covered wit? mittens or gauntlets and only his face wss visible beneath the hocded garment. He appeared to be sbout 5s feet tall and very stocky looking in ths suit. His left hand was placed on the craft and the right was on hi: hip.

Dr. Utke points out the facts relative to UFO's are very confusing, While the Air Force states thpt only approximately 3% of the repcrts they hzve received in the last 22 years have involved hoaxes, hallucin- ations and psychological problems, these \"crzckpot\" csses are often highly publicized and overlook the fact that ebout 97% of the cases have involved objects seen in the sky rathcr thzn in the mind. And when the Air Force emphasizes thet they can explain about 93% of the reports they've received, people tend to overlook the converse fact thpt approximately 7% have gone unexplained. Also, the fact ths-t many UFO1s hpve been described as being soiic objects cr \"machinesf1 moving in a mnnnpr suggestive of possible extra- terrestial origin h~s been negated by the many scientists who deny the possibilitv of our being visited by svrh er+,ra-t~rrer;+.%21~. .\\ An0thc.r reason we nave almost completelv ignored UFOTs, Dr. dtke savs, is because there is no overwhelming llscic-ntificll evidence available that forces us to admit they they exist pnd constitute a. problem. \"The evidence th~t is available is only circumstanti~l-,\" he says. \"It has not stood the test of a scientific court of law, wherr the emphasis is on reproducible physical data that can be studf~ed i;~ a Izborat~ry.~~ The technique of using lie detectors, hypnosis 2nd lltrut,h drilgs\" to verify verbal reports is open to debate and question, thus doubt. Photographs, movies, radar sightings, burnt vegetation, llgoassemerw marks on the ground, radioactivity, and electrcm~gnetic effects 3.5 not conclusively support verbal accounts either, Dr. Utke believes, All of these things, he seys, except movies, ra.'.ar sightings, and electromagnktic effects, can be folrly easily faked. Movies are more difficult to fake, but they are alsa very rzre. \"No definitive, con- vincing movie of a UFO taken at close range exists at the present time,\" he states. Civilian and military radar sightings sre seldom made public and cannot be conclusive evidence as the sightings cccur llindirectly on a rather sensitive machine which must be operpted and interpreted by a human being.\" hd, although there have been many 114ualitative11 rc-. ports of ele ctromepnetic effects accompanying sightings of UFO's, again these have been vcrbal accounts. No \"quzntitztive\" measurements have been recorded on scientific instrument2, With the evidence just listed being circumstatial .rather than conclusive \"scientific proof,Ir thet UFOrs exist and constitute a valid problem worthy of investig~tion, where do we go from here?

(authx, of \"A Down to Earth Look at the Space Menv in the May SKYLOOK) has senr. us his views on Keel's book, andwe think youTll find them interesting, The first few pages of this book brings to the attention of the reaci er that we do have some unusual vehicles flying about in the air and landing on the ground. We learn that people in all walks of life are still seeing them. These UFOs sre tracked by radar and chased by jet fighter planes. These objects have lights at night, and look metallic in daylight, Then John Keel reaches out and grabs a few wclinkersv and scatters them around for a foundation on which he builds his hypothesis. The author mentions that he screened out all reports that hsd a ready ex- planation, but in his eagerness to investigate all the evidence, he accepted any and all scraps of information that came his way and glued the UFO label to them. From this odd information we lcarn that the solid objects are not real at all, and the vaporous ghostly apparitions are the real thing. If projections are really involved, would it not be logical to pur- sue the idea that the solid objects might be responsible for the misty . on'again, off again configurations instead? The reader is led to beiS-evi. that all unusual lights seen in.the distance are aut'omatically desig- nated to the ,\"soft sighting! category. This idea is in error and withou: foundation. Since this UT theory is built so strongly on observers' stories that 'UFOs just \"disappeared,!' the investigator ~ho~?d pause be- fore he thinks he has found the answer. The word vdisay.peai-ll in Ut 0 ?e- ports is used so loosely that it could hzve sevcral mesnings, an5 pass- ibly none of them would act~~ally describe wh;t happened to th2 oLject. A low flylng vehicle could edisappearv simply by turnmg out ligLts during nlght flights, or by simply going behind hills, trees, buildings or clouds tha,t the observer knows nothing about. Building a theory on the assumption that an object \"vanishedu into the fourth dimension rnzrr3 ly because the observer did not see where it went is treading on sh>i;~ ground. Keel also puts UFOs into Never Never Land because 23 years of 97:r:~~3 tigation\" has not solved the mystery, UFOs are a complex prcblem, a ,C only a handful of scientists have taken a small peek under the rug on two or three occasions. This could hardly produce results on any s12b- ject, UFO sightirigs have been reparted for many years, but we are jix:, now beginning to hear of the first few faltering steps toward a reai look at the situation by-people who are capable of solving the mystery, There is such a wealth of unusual and interesting information set down in this book,,it is unfortunate that such a theory was tacked on just to be different, Editor's Note: Henk J. Hinfelaar, editor of SPACEVIEW, P. 0. Box 21-007, Henderson, Auckknd, 8, N. Z., writes: '!If, as John Keel sug- gests, UFOs may be nothing more than transmuted ener.$y patterns which are shown to us in a shape that m~kes sense, there is obviously no reason why these \"shapes\" shou1.d conform to laws that can be satis- factorily understood.

Admiral ByrdTs persons1 pypers are prez,.-:lt- ly and apparently for a long time to come, tightly closed agzinst ~u.!.~ic scrutiny. His family isn't talking. Admiral Byrd wzs a meticulous story-teller. His many books are fllled with detpiled day-by-day accounts of what he has done and seen on his various expeditions by land, sea and air into the Arctic and th2 Antarc- tic, over a period of more than 70 ycars. But. ir, his publis;l.cd worh he says very little about his findings in 194.7 on his fllpht over t1.0 North Pole, nor does he dwell upon any conclusions regaraing his bi-,?rre flight over the South Pole in 1956. Of necessity, therefore, we must rely on the contemporary newsp~per and radio accounts, so we turn to the Kew York Times for '!all the nelrJ3 th2t1s fit to printf1 about these incredible polar expeditions.
