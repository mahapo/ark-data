Skeptics ascribe abduction ac- counts to the vagaries of human psychology, and therefore dismiss the stories out of hand. Debunkers ignore the intriguing confirmatory details: the multiple witness events, the physical traces left by the ufonauts, the scars and implants left (according to fre- quent report) on the abductees. The skeptics scoff, though the abductees tell stories similar in detail — even cer- tain tiny details, not known to the general public. Conversely, uncritical Believers ac- cept stories of ET spacenappings at face value. They accept despite the absurdity of these tales, despite the in- ternal contradictions, and despite reports that \"The Visitors\" use vile and inhuman tactics of medical ex- amination — senseless procedures most of us (and certainly the vanguard of an advanced race) would be ashamed to inflict on an animal. Occasionally, we get the rough notes of a rationalization for this unseemly behavior. The extraordinary field investigator Budd Hopkins com- pares the aliens to a blind man step- ping on your foot; the abductors, Hopkins suggests, simply don't know what they are doing. This excuse won't wash. Think about it: The ufonauts allegedly know enough about our society to go about their business undetected by either the federal or local constabularies — according to Hopkins' most recent reports, they even work with selected government operatives. The aliens communicate with abductees in human tongues and concern themselves with details of the percipients' innermost lives. They predict apocalypses for some of their captives, play sophisticated psycho- logical games with others, and even evoke ancient religious symbologies for selected guests (as in the cases of Herb Schirmer and Betty An- dreasson). Yet they remain so ig- norant of our culture as to be unaware of our basic moral precepts concern- ing the dignity of the individual and the right to self-determination. Neither the \"extraterrestrial\" nor the \"psychological\" hypotheses complete- ly satisfies, which is why many thoughtful ufologists have regarded abduction claims with guarded interest and a commendable restraint from conclusion-hopping. When asked to choose between the competing scenarios, the cautious observer may well prefer to vote \"none of the above.\" The ballot needs a third-party candidate. I nominate a new hypothesis. It re- mains far from proven, and I remain far from certain that it will hold. But preliminary evidence does exist. The abduction enigma contains numerous sub-mysteries which slide into this new explanatory scheme with surpris- ing ease, even elegance. Mysteries which fit the ET scenario as uncom- fortably as a size 10 foot fits a size 8 shoe. Perhaps the best way to introduce this scenario is to draw the reader's at- tention to one of Budd Hopkins' cases, a multiple witness event. The percipients experienced missing time during a trip to the wilderness. Later, they recalled little beyond an en- counter with mysterious \"hikers\" on the trail. And since each witness described the hikers differently, Hopkins assumed that these mysterious wanderers may have con- stituted a \"screen memory,\" a comfor- ting confabulation hiding the psychologically overwhelming reality of alien encounter. Thus, Hopkins decided to hypnotically regress a witness and pierce the layer of false memory to uncover the UFO abduction. Why, then, did the witnesses all describe an encounter with \"hikers\"? The ufonauts, Hopkins believes, deliberately implanted the memory. In his words, they used \"some kind of mind control.\" Consider that statement carefully. In the first place, Hopkins has demolished his own \"blind man\" argument: Our ways can't be that \"alien\" to the aliens if they know what hikers are, what campers are, and the sociological pressures which prompt city-dwelling homo sapiens to embark on the occasional foray into the forest. If the aliens know those details, they're no stranger to our culture. But the larger point is this: How do we know that the abductors are aliens at all? Because, Hopkins would say, the abductees said so during regression. But the percipients were also, accor- ding to this story, placed under some variety of mind control. How can we trust the perceptions of someone whose perceptions have been altered? What if the kidnappers were actual- ly human beings, using advanced hypnotic techniques to create the \"alien\" screen memory? As we examine this alternative, we will, of necessity, stray far from the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"saucers. We must turn our face from the paranormal and concentrate on the occult, if, by \"occult,\" we mean only secret. I posit that the abductees have been abducted. Yet they are also spewing fantasy, or, more precisely, they have been given a set of lies to repeat and believe. If my hypothesis proves true, then we must accept the following: The kidnapping is real. The medical ex- aminations, the mental games, the pain, the \"instruction sessions,\" the fear, all this is real. But the little grey men from Zeti Reticuli are not real; they are constructs, Halloween masks meant to disguise the real faces of the controllers. The abductors may not be visitors from Beyond; rather, they may be a symptom of the carcinoma which blackens our body politic. The fault lies not in our stars, but in ourselves. Mind Control Can, and would, human beings do such a thing? The historical record says yes. Substantial evidence exists linking members of this country's intelligence community (including the Central In- telligence Agency, the Defense Ad- vanced Research Projects Agency and the Office of Naval Intelligence) with the esoteric technology of mind con- trol. For decades, \"spy-chiatrists\" working behind the scenes, on college campuses, in CIA-sponsored in- stitutes, and (most heinously) in prisons, have experimented with the erasure of memory, hypnotic resistance to torture, truth serums, post-hypnotic suggestion, rapid in- duction of hypnosis, electronic stimulation of the brain, non-ionizing radiation, microwave induction of in- tracerebral \"voices,\" and a host of even more disturbing technologies. Some of the projects exploring these areas were ARTICHOKE, BLUE- BIRD, PANDORA, MKDELTA, MKSEARCH and the infamous MKULTRA. I have read nearly every available book on these projects, as well as the Substantial evidence exists linking members of this coun- try's intelligence community, including the Central In- telligence Agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Office of Naval Intelligence, with the esoteric technology of mind control. relevant congressional testimony. I have also spent much time in univer- sity libraries researching relevant ar- ticles, contacting other researchers (who have graciously allowed me ac- cess to their files), and conducting in- terviews. Moreover, I traveled to Washington DC to review the files John Marks compiled when he wrote The Search For the \"Manchurian Candidate.\" l These files include some 20,000 pages of CIA and Defense Department documents, interviews, scientific articles, letters, etc. I com- pared what I learned from these sources with the literature on abduc- tions, and with the information glean- ed from abductee interviews. As a result of this research, I have come to the following conclusions: • Although misleading (and occa- sionally perjured) testimony before Congress indicated that the CIA's \"brainwashing\" efforts met with little success, 2 striking advances were, in fact, made in this field. As CIA veteran Miles Copeland once admit- ted to a reporter, \"The congressional subcommittee which went into this sort of thing got only the barest glimp- se.\" 3 • Clandestine research into thought manipulation has not stopped, despite CIA protestations that it no longer sponsors such studies. Victor Marchetti, 14-year veteran of the CIA and author of the renowned expose, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence, confirmed in a 1977 interview that the mind control research continues, and that CIA claims to the contrary are a \"cover story.\" 4 • The Central Intelligence Agency was not the only government agen- cy involved in this research. 5 Indeed, many branches of our government took part in these studies, including NASA and the Atomic Energy Com- mission, as well as all branches of the Defense Department. To these conclusions, I would ap- pend the following, not as firmly- established historical fact, but as a working hypothesis and grounds for investigation: • The \"UFO abduction\" phenome- non might be a continuation of clandestine mind control operations. I recognize the difficulties this thesis may present to those readers emo- tionally wedded to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, or to those whose political Weltanshauung disallows any such suspicions. Still, the open-minded stu- dent of abductions should consider the possibilities. Certainly, we are not being narrow-minded if we ask resear- chers to exhaust all terrestrial explana- tions before looking heavenward. I invite the skeptical reader to exa- mine the work of George Estabrooks, a seminal theorist on the use of hyp- nosis in warfare, and a veteran of Pro- ject MKULTRA. Estabrooks once amused himself during a party by covertly hypnotizing two friends, who were led to believe that the Prime Minister of England had just arrived; Estabrooks' victims spent an hour conversing with, and even serving drinks to, the esteemed visitor. 6 For ufologists, this incident raises an in- escapable question: If the Mesmeric arts can successfully evoke a non- existent Prime Minister, why can't a representative from the Pleiades be similarly induced? Hypnosis, however, was scarcely the only subject covered by MKULTRA. CIA scientists also thoroughly examin- ed the areas of psychological condi- tioning, sensory deprivation, drugs, religious cults, microwaves, psycho- surgery, brain implants and even ESP. When MKULTRA \"leaked\" to the public during the great CIA investiga- tions of the 1970s, public attention focused most heavily on drug ex- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I recognize the difficulties this thesis may present to those readers emotionally wedded to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, or to those whose political Weltanshauung disallows any such suspicions. Still, the open-minded stu- dent of abductions should consider the possibilities. perimentation and the work with ESP. 7 Mystery still shrouds another area of study: psychoelectronics. This research may prove key to our understanding of the UFO abduction phenomenon. Implants Perhaps the most interesting pieces of evidence surrounding the abduc- tion phenomenon are the intracere- bral implants allegedly visible in the X-rays and MRI scans of many ab- ductees. 8 Indeed, abductees often describe operations in which needles are inserted into the brain; more fre- quently still, they report implantation of foreign objects through the sinus cavities. Many abduction specialists assume that these intercranial incursions must be the handiwork of scientists from the stars. Unfortunately, these resear- chers have failed to familiarize themselves with certain little-heralded advances in terrestrial technology. The abductees' implants strongly suggest a technological lineage which can be traced to a device known as a \"stimoceiver,\" invented in the 1950s by a neuroscientist named Jose Del- gado. The stimoceiver is a miniature depth electrode which can receive and transmit electronic signals over FM radio waves. By stimulating a correctly-positioned stimoceiver, an outside operator can wield a surpris- ing degree of control over the subject's responses. The most famous example of the stimoceiver in action occurred in a Madrid bull ring. Delgado \"wired\" the bull before stepping into the ring, en- tirely unprotected. Furious for gore, the bull charged toward the doctor, then stopped, just before reaching him. The technician-turned-toreador had halted the animal by simply pushing a burton on a black box, held in the hand. 9 Delgado's Physical Control of the Mind: Toward a Psychocivilised Socie- ty, 10 though outdated, remains the sole full-length, popularly-written work on intracerebral implants and electronic stimulation of the brain (ESB). His animal and human ex- periments clearly demonstrate that the experimenter can electronically elicit the extremes of temperament, rage, lust, fatigue, etc., as easily as an organist might call forth a C-major chord. Delgado writes: \"Radio Stimulation of different points in the amygdala and hippocampus in the four patients produced a variety of effects, in- cluding pleasant sensations, elation, deep, thoughtful concentration, odd feelings, super relaxation, colored vi- sions, and other responses.\" 11 The evocative phrase \"colored vision\" clearly indicates remotely-induced hallucination, hallucinations which may be \"controlled\" by an outside operator. Speaking in 1966, and reflecting research undertaken years previous, Delgado asserted that his experiments \"support the distasteful conclusion that motion, emotion, and behavior can be directed by electrical forces and that humans can be controlled like robots by push buttons.\" 12 He even prophesied a day when brain control could be turned over to non-human operators, by establishing two-way radio communication between the im- planted brain and a computer. 13 Of one experimental subject, Delgado notes that \"the patient ex- pressed the successive sensations of fainting, fright and floating around. These 'floating' feelings were repeat- edly evoked on different days by stimulation of the same point ...\" I4 Ufologists may recognize the similarity of this sequence of events to abductee reports of the opening minutes of their experiences. 15 Under subsequent hyp- nosis, the abductee could be in- structed to misremember the cause of this floating sensation. Internal Microphone In a fascinating series of ex- periments, Delgado attached the stimoceiver to the tympanic mem- brane, thereby transforming the ear into a sort of microphone. An assis- tant would whisper \"How are you?\" into the ear of a suitably \"fixed\" cat, and Delgado could hear the words over a loudspeaker in the next room. The application of this technology to the spy trade should be readily apparent. According to Victor Marchetti, the Agency once attempted a highly- sophisticated extension of this basic idea. Radio implants were attached to a cat's cochlea, to facilitate the pin- pointing of specific conversations, freed from extraneous surrounding noises. 16 Such \"advances\" exacerbate the already-imposing level of Twen- tieth-Century paranoia: Not only can our phones be tapped and mail checked, but even Tabby may be spy- ing on us! Yet the ramifications of this technology may go even deeper than Marchetti indicates. I presume that if a suitably-wired subject's inner ear can be made into a microphone, it can also be made into a loudspeaker, one possible explanation for the \"voices\" heard by abductees. 17 Indeed, I have personally viewed a strange, opalescent implant within the ear canal of an abductee. I see no reason to ascribe this device to alien intrusion; more than likely, the \"in- truders\" in this case were the technological inheritors of the Delgado legacy. Delgado is scarcely the sole ex- perimenter working with electrode im- plants and radio-controlled ESB. He is simply the most visible. Robert G. Heath, of Tulane Univer- sity, who has implanted as many as 125 electrodes in his subjects, achieved MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"his greatest notoriety by attempting to ^\"cure\" homosexuality through ESB. In his experiments, he discovered that he could control his patients' memory, (a -feat which, applied in a ufological con- text, may account for the phenom- enon of \"missing time\"); he could also induce sexual arousal, fear, pleasure and hallucinations. 18 Heath and another researcher, James Olds, 19 have independently il- lustrated that areas of the brain in and near the hypothalamus have, when electronically stimulated, what has been described as \"rewarding\" and \"aversive\" effects. Both animals and men, when given the means to induce their own ESB of the brain's pleasure centers, will stimulate themselves at a tremendous rate, ignoring such basic drives as hunger and thirst. 20 (Using fixed electrodes of his own invention, John C. Lilly had accomplished similar effects in the early 1950s. 21 ) Anyone who has studied the abduction phenomenon will find himself on familiar territory here, for the abductee accounts are replete with stories of bewildering and inappropriate sexual response countered by extremely pain- ful stimuli — operant conditioning, at its most extreme, and most insidious, for here we see a form of condition- ing in which the manipulator renders himself invisible. 22 Ralph Schwitzgebel and his brother Robert have produced a panoply of devices for tracking individuals over long ranges; they may be considered the creators of the \"electronic house arrest\" devices recently approved by the courts. 23 Schwitzgebel devices could be used for tracking all of the physical and neurological signs of a \"patient\" within a quarter of a mile, 24 thereby lifting the distance limitations which restricted Delgado. Perhaps the most disturbing wanderer in this mind-field is Joseph A. Meyer, of the National Security Agency, the most formidable and secretive component of America's na- tional security complex. Meyer has proposed implanting roughly half of all Americans arrested — not necessarily convicted — of any crime; the numbers of \"subscribers\" (his Hypnosis was scarcely the only subject covered by MKULTRA. CIA scientists also thoroughly examined the areas of psychological conditioning, sensory deprivation, drugs, religious cults, microwaves, psycho-surgery, brain implants and even ESP. euphemism) would run into the tens of millions. \"Subscribers\" could be monitored continually by computer wherever they went. Meyer, who has carefully worked out the economics of his mass-implantation system, asserts that taxpayer liability should be reduced by forcing subscribers to \"rent\" the implant from the State. 25 Abductee Implants If we are to take seriously abductee accounts of brain implants, we must consider the possibility that the im- planters, properly perceived, don't look much like the \"greys\" pictured on Strieber's dustjackets. Instead, the visitors may resemble Dr. Meyer and his brethern. We would thus have an explana- tion for both the reports of abductee brain implants and, as we shall see, the \"scoop marks\" and other scars visible on other parts of the abductees' bodies. We would also have an ex- planation for the reports of individuals suffering personality change after con- tact with the UFO phenomenon. Researchers looking for connec- tions between mind control victims and alleged UFO abductees should study the case of Robert Naeslund, a Swedish victim of mind control ex- perimentation. 26 His intercranial \"ex- tra\" showed up on an X-ray; eventual- ly, the implant was tested by Hewlitt- Packard engineers and removed by a surgeon. Naeslund first learned of his implant after an experience of miss- ing time, followed by an inexplicable nosebleed. This detail will immediate- ly strike a chord with anyone who knows the UFO abduction literature. Intriguingly, I have located a reference in the open literature to the use of nasally-implanted electrodes in an animal study. 27 Skeptics might counter that the time factor of UFO abductions disallows this possibility. If estimates of \"missing time\" are correct, the ab- ductions rarely take longer than one- to-three hours. Wouldn't a brain surgeon, operating under less-than- ideal conditions (perhaps in a mobile unit) need more time? No — not if we accept the claims of a Florida doctor named Daniel Man. He recently proposed a draco- nian solution to the overblown \"miss- ing children problem,\" by suggesting a program wherein America's young- sters would be implanted with tiny transmitters in order to track the children continuously. Man brags that the operation can be done right in the office, and would take less than 20 minutes. 28 Conceivably, it might take a tad longer in the field. Some might argue that abduction accounts pre-date this advanced human technology. If certain ufo- logists (such as John Keel and Jac- ques Vallee) insist on reading ancient tales of \"fairy kidnappings\" as dis- guised versions of abduction events, then I can offer no counter-argument, except to note that even the cleverest modern investigator might have some trouble verifying details in a case where the participants have been dead for centuries. But if we agree that \"classic\" alien abductions are a comparitively recent phenomenon, then one would have a hard time arguing that \"alien im- plants\" pre-date \"human implants.\" For three reasons: • We can never know with certainty the true origin dates of the various brainwashing methods; often, we discover that techniques which seem impossibly futuristic, actually originated in the 19th century. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(Pioneering ESB research was con- ducted in 1898, by J.R. Ewald, pro- fessor of physiology at Strauss- bourg. 29 ) • The open literature almost cer- tainly gives a bowdlerized view of the actual research. • Lavishly-funded clandestine researchers — unrestrained by peer review or the need for strict controls — can achieve far more rapid pro- gress than scientists on \"the outside.\" Potential critics should keep these points in mind should they attempt to invalidate the \"mind control\" thesis of UFO abductions by citing an abduc- tion account which antedates Delgado. His work forces us to confront a troubling question. I've presented this question to numerous ufologists, none of whom have offered any sort of reasonable reply. Why — if we take UFO abduction accounts at face value — are the \"advanced aliens\" using an old technology, an Earth technology, a technology which may soon be rendered obsolescent, if it hasn't been so rendered already? Do they also watch black-and-white television on Zeta Reticuli? Remote Hypnosis Since the earliest days of project BLUEBIRD, the CIA's opening salvo in the mind wars, the Agency's spy- chiatrists have spent enormous sums mastering Mesmer's art. I cannot here give a history of hypnosis, nor even of the CIA's studies in this area. In- stead, we will concentrate on a par- ticularly intriguing allegation, one heard faintly, but persistently, for the past twenty years by those who would investigate the shadow side of politics. If this allegation proves true, hyp- nosis is not necessarily a person-to- person affair. The abductee, or the mind control victim, need not even have physical contact with a hypnotist for hypnotic suggestion to take effect; trance could be induced, and suggestions made, via the intracerebral transmitters described above. Over the years, certain journalists have asserted that clandestine re- searchers have mastered a technology called RHIC-EDOM. RHIC means \"Radio Hypnotic Intracerebral Con- trol.\" EDOM stands for \"Electronic Dissolution of Memory.\" Together, these techniques can, allegedly, remotely induce hypnotic trance, deliver suggestions to the subject, and erase all memory for both the instruc- tion period and the act which the sub- ject is asked to perform. RHIC uses the stimoceiver, or a microminiaturized offspring of that technology, to induce a hypnotic state. Interestingly, this technique is also reputed to involve the use of in- tramuscular implants, a detail striking- ly reminiscent of the \"scars\" men- tioned in Budd Hopkin's Missing Time. Apparently, these implants are stimulated to induce a post-hypnotic suggestion. (Another explanation for the intramuscular implants lies in their possible use as reference electrodes. 30 ) EDOM is nothing more than \"miss- ing time\" itself, the erasure of memory from consciousness through the blockage of synaptic transmission in certain areas of the brain. By jamming the brain's synapses through a surfeit of acetocholine, neural transmission along selected pathways can be effec- tively stilled. According to the pro- ponents of RHIC-EDOM, acetocho- line production can be affected by electromagnetic means. (Modern research in the psycho-physiological effects of microwaves confirm this proposition.) Does RHIC-EDOM exist? In our discussion of Delgado's work, I have already cited a strange little book (published in 1969) titled Were We Controlled?, written by one Lincoln Lawrence, a former FBI agent turned journalist. (The name is a pseudo- nym; I know his real identity.) This work deals at length with RHIC- EDOM; a careful comparison of Lawrence's work with MKULTRA files declassified ten years later indicates a strong possibility that the writer did in- deed have \"inside\" sources. Here is how Lawrence describes RHIC in action: \"It is the ultra- sophisticated application of post- hypnotic suggestion triggered at will [italics in original] by radio transmis- sion. It is a recurring hypnotic state, re-induced automatically at intervals by the same radio control. An in- dividual is brought under hypnosis. This can be done either with his knowledge — or without it by use of narco-hypnosis, which can be brought into play under many guises. He is then programmed to perform certain actions and maintain certain attitudes upon radio signal.\" Other authors have mentioned this technique, specifically journalist James Moore, who, in a 1975 issue of a periodical called Modern People, claimed to have secured a 350-page manual, prepared in 1963, on RHIC- EDOM. 31 He received the manual from CIA sources, although, in- terestingly, the technique is said to have originated in the military. The following quote by Moore on RHIC should prove especially intrigu- ing to abduction researchers who have confronted odd \"personality shifts\" in abductees: \"Medically, these radio signals are directed to certain parts of the brain. When a part of your brain receives a tiny electrical impulse from outside sources, such as vision, hearing, etc., an emotion is produced — anger at the sight of a gang of boys beating an old woman, for example. The same emotion of anger can be created by artificial radio signals sent to your brain by a controller. You could in- stantly feel the same white hot anger without any apparent reason.\" 3Z Lawrence's sources imparted an even more tantalizing, and frighten- ing revelation: \"... there is already in use a small EDOM generator-transmitter which can be concealed on the body of the person. Contact with this person — a casual handshake or even just a touch — transmits a tiny electronic charge plus an ultra-sonic signal tone which for a short while will disturb the time orientation of the person af- fected.\" 33 If RHIC-EDOM exists, it goes a long way toward providing an earth- bound rationale for alien abductions MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 Schweiker went on to mention that he had heard testimony that radar (i.e., microwaves) had been used to wipe out memory in animals; Gottlieb responded, \"lean believe that, Senator.\" — or, at least, certain aspects of them. The phenomenon of \"missing time\" is no longer mysterious. Abductee im- plants, both intracerebral and other- wise, are explained. And note the reference to a \"recurring hypnotic state, re-induced automatically by the same radio command.\" This situation may account for \"repeater\" abductees who, after their initial encounter, have regular sessions of \"missing time\" and abductions, even while a bed-mate sleeps undisturbed. At present, I cannot claim con- clusively that RHIC-EDOM is real. To my knowledge, the only official ques- tioning of a CIA representative con- cerning these techniques occurred in 1977, during Senate hearings on CIA drug testing. When Senator Richard Schweiker asked Sidney Gottlieb, an important MKULTRA administrator, about RHIC, the good doctor replied that the techniques did not exist. But his further comments bear close scrutiny: \"I am trying to be re- sponsive to the terms that you used. As I remember it, there was a current interest, running interest, all the time in what effects people standing in a field of radio energy have, and it could easily have been that somewhere in many projects, someone was trying to see if you could hypnotize someone easier if he was standing in a radio beam. That would seem like a reasonable piece of research to do.\" Schweiker went on to mention that he had heard testimony that radar (i.e., microwaves) had been used to wipe out memory in animals; Gottlieb responded, \"I can believe that, Senator.\" 34 Gottlieb's blandishments do not comfort much. For one thing, the good doctor did not always provide thoroughly candid testimony. We should also recognize that the .CIA's operations are compartmentalized on a \"need-to-know\" basis; Gottlieb may not have had access to the informa- tion requested by Schweiker. Note that the MKULTRA rubric cir- cumscribed Gottlieb's statement: RHIC-EDOM might have been the focus of another program. (There were several others: MKNAOMI, MKACTION, MKSEARCH, etc.) Also keep in mind the revelation by \"Deep Trance\" that the CIA concentrated on psychoelectronics after the termina- tion of MKULTRA in 1963. Most significantly: RHIC-EDOM is described by both Lawrence and Moore as a product of military research; Gottlieb spoke only of mat- ters pertaining to CIA. He may thus have spoken truthfully, at least in a strictly technical sense, while still misleading his Congressional in- terlocutors. Recall, Gottlieb was \"responsive\" to the exact term, \"RHIC.\" If the CIA used a technique bearing any other name, Gottlieb need not have volunteered the information. Personally, I find it significant that when Dr. Fetter Lindstrom examined X-rays of Robert Naeslund, the afore- mentioned victim of brain-implan- tation, the doctor authoritatively cited Were We Controlled? in his letter of response. 35 This is the same Dr. Lind- strom noted for his pioneering use of ultrasonics in neurosurgery. 36 Lincoln Lawrence's book has received a strong endorsement indeed. Bowart's Operation Mind Control contains a significant interview with an intelligence agent knowledgeable in these areas. Granted, the reader has every right to adopt a skeptical at- titude toward information culled from anonymous sources; still, one should note that this operative's statements confirm, in pertinent part, Lincoln Lawrence's thesis. 37 Most importantly: The open literature on brain-wave entrainment and the behavioral effects of eletromagnetic radiation substantiates much of the RHIC-EDOM story, as we shall see.  --•--.

In another interview with Marks, former Air Force-CIA liaison L. Flet- cher Prouty confirmed that the Department of Defense ran studies either in conjunction with or parallel to those operated by the CIA. (Marks' files.) 6. Estabrooks, Hypnosis (New York: E.P.

Information or Misinformation The case of Milton William Cooper By James A. Harder, Ph.D. Introduction In the eternal struggle to gain new truth, we are sometimes inclined to gloss over the errors committed by those who agree with us in major ways, thinking of them as allies. In the following I analyze an example of in- formation (or misinformation) offered by a person who definitely believes UFOs are real, and who is likely for that reason to be ridiculed by those who think they are imaginary. While we may not wish to ridicule such presumed allies, it would be a mistake to abandon our critical faculties and to automatically accept all such data for the truth. Stories of \"secrets\" are made plausible by a government policy of withholding information about its UFO programs, plus a public percep- tion that many secrets are there. In re- cent years several persons have come forward with reports of secret U.S. government collaboration with UFO aliens. The most spectacular of these claim that we are headed for disaster and have but a short time before the aliens will be taking over the earth. In some of the more garish reports humans are said to serve as the aliens' food supply. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 This is heady stuff. But lacking in- dependent confirming data we find it difficult to evaluate the truth of these stories. So in the murky areas we must sometimes plumb, misinforma- tion may be as likely as valid informa- tion, and often we have difficulty in separating the two. Sometimes we must just admit we do not know. I hope that an analysis of the Cooper case will be of help in those instances where we want very much to learn about certain material, but must be wary of the validity of the data offered. The Cooper Case Milton William Cooper claims that in 1972 he saw two documents (described as Blue Book Special Report 13 and a report referred to as Operation majority) that contained astonishing material dealing with government UFO programs. He com- piled a document, which he first released on December 18, 1988, that details his recall of the 1972 material (my analysis is based on his revised text of January 10, 1989). It does not appear that he wrote anything down in 1972. He does say he sought the recent help of a hypnotist to aid his recall. Cooper has stated in his report, as reproduced in Linda Moulton Howe's book An Alien Harvest (1), that he is willing to undertake a lie detector test. We might hope for such a test; however, the validity of a lie- detector test could be challenged on the basis that it only detects intentional lies. It would not detect as lies that material a person (perhaps er- roneously) believes to be true. In what follows, references to par- ticular pages are to pages in Ms. Howe's book, reference (1). Cooper states that he learned of his secret information while serving as a petty officer (he was a quartermaster second class at the time) \"in briefings which I helped to prepare in the course of my duties on the In- telligence Briefing Team of the Com- mander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet ...\" (page 290). In this scenario the Commander of the Pacific Fleet is assumed to have a \"need to know\" about material classified above Top Secret but not connected with his military duties, and which included a wide variety of alleged facts such as the existence of diplomatic relations with UFO aliens and communications with them, plus government plans to establish martial law and round up UFO-tainted citizens in anticipation of ?.n imminent takeover. Furthermore we must also believe that a petty officer second class in the quartermaster ranks (who has not claimed he was in Naval In- telligence or that he had any kind of security clearance) would be a part of an intelligence briefing team and be given access to such extraordinarily secret material. Discharge Papers Cooper's discharge papers, form DD-214 (a copy of page one of the DD-214 is on page 289) contain in- formation important to his claims. On page 195 he states that his primary navy classification was Quartermaster and that his secondary classification was Internal Security. Yet on the date of his separation, December 11, 1975, his form DD-214 clearly shows that both his primary and secondary specialties were Quartermaster (boxes 16 and 17). It shows that his rank of first class petty officer was achieved on May 16, 1974. Thus at the time he said he obtained his secret infor- mation (1972) he could only have been a petty officer second class; a person holding this rank is not likely to be entrusted with anything above secret. His form DD-214 shows that on July 23, 1970 a personnel securi- ty investigation was completed; it does not show the outcome. The box for Authority and Reason for discharge (box 9c) is marked out with dashes; this is most unusual. My consultant in Navy lore states that every DD-214 he has ever seen has quoted a BUPERS Manual section relative to the reason, i.e. end of enlist- ment, medical, etc. At the bottom right side of this page the preprinted \"1\" is marked over with a \"2,\" with no apparent reason. My consultant sug- gests it would help in evaluating Mr. Cooper's total record were Cooper to authorize the release of his entire DD-214 to an independent party so that additional information and pos- sible alterations could be checked. He also notes that Mr. Cooper was 32 at the time of his separation, and had he re-enlisted for only six more years could have received a generous retire- ment at age 38; thus he wonders if the material originally in box 9c con- tained a reason for the separation that Cooper is trying to hide, possibly that he was discharged under section 8 (mental). The way in which Cooper released his information is also of interest. It is stated (page 177) that Cooper re- leased the information to the Com- puServe and Paranet networks. To use these networks one must have the requisite equipment and pay a monthly fee, and to gain access must use a password and code that serves as an identification for billing pur- poses. A skilled hacker might gain ac- cess illegally or use stolen codes, but Cooper's statements belie a hacker level of sophistication. His information was widely disseminated on two oc- casions separated by three weeks. It is hard to believe that if any of it were really classified or taken seriously he would have escaped detection and ar- rest. The methods available to track and identify ports on a computer net- work are very sophisticated; see the Reader's Digest for April 1990. Cooper states (page 292) that he was frightened that his actions might have \"signed his death warrant.\" Had he any idea of how computer net- works can be monitored and tracked, and if his material was not just his own made-up story, he would have used the system once under an assumed name (this could be troublesome, since the name would have to pass a credit check) and put many miles between himself and the access port. His sophistication in computer opera- tions is tested again (page 210) when he states that communication with the aliens was via \"the use of the binary computer language ... .\"A know- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 A self-contained missle that could carry the power source and the excavating equipment to drill a vertical shaft 1000 meters deep in any reasonable time is a fantasy that no oil drilling company would fall for. ledgeable person would know that binary is not a language, but a way of coding language. There is much evidence that the ETs understand English; if the language were English, it would normally be coded in ASCII. Internal Evidence Much of the material released by Cooper, such as the names and duties of several projects within the overall UFO project, cannot be connected with independent external or internal data. Some of the material can be compared with external information that is well understood. In the follow- ing I quote from his report and then give an analysis to show how far Cooper's claims are from anything reasonable. • \"Excalibur is a weapon to destroy the alien underground bases. It is to be a missile capable of penetrating 1000 meters of tufa (sic)/hard packed soil such as that found in New Mex- ico with no operational damage. Missile apogee not to exceed 30,000 feet above ground level and impact must not deviate in excess of 50 meters from designated target. The device will carry a one megaton nuclear warhead\" (page 295). • Analysis: We know from readily available sources that the crater depth caused by a one megaton nuclear weapon, as a surface burst, is on the order of 50 meters. A self-contained missile that could carry the power source and the excavating equipment to drill a vertical shaft 1000 meters deep (even in soft earth) in any reasonable time is a fantasy that no oil drilling company would fall for. It may be an idea one could find in popular mechanics magazines, but it is very far from what any technically trained person knows to be possible at our level. • \"Joshua is a project to develop a low frequency pulsed sound generating weapon. It was said that this weapon would be effective against the alien craft and beam weapons (page 295). • Analysis: The idea of a \"sound generating weapon,\" has been around, either as a low frequency device or a ultrasound device, for at least 50 years in the pages of popular mechanics magazines. Of course the ultimate pressure that could be developed by a \"low frequency sound weapon\" is double the local at- mospheric pressure (and due to non- linear effects this ultimate pressure dif- ference could not be maintained very far from the source), which is hardly a pressure that could cause damage to any reasonably strong structure such as a UFO that can travel many times the speed of sound. If alien \"beam weapons\" are based on in- tense light (laser beams) there is no way that sound waves, intense or not, can affect them. • \"Aliens: There are four types of aliens mentioned in the papers. A large nosed grey with whom we have the treaty; the grey reported in ab- ductee cases that work for the large nosed greys; a blond human-like type described as the Nordic and a red haired human-like type called the Orange. The homes of the aliens were described as being a star in the Con- stellation of Orion, Bamards Star, and Zeta Riticuli (sic) 1 & 2. I cannot remember even under hypnosis which alien belongs to which star\" (page 296). • Analysis: An analysis of the material in this paragraph requires a broad familiarity with alien life-forms not usually available. In my own ex- perience, the perception of blond Nordic-type hair (and by extension red hair) disappears when the witness is put into a deep state of hypnosis. It is as if the perception of blond hair is an illusion put into the mind of the subject (by the aliens) as a means of projecting a less threatening image. Nevertheless it has been reported enough to have encouraged Cooper to report it as a part of his story. The idea of Zeta Reticulum as a home for aliens dates back to the Hill case, where Betty remembered a three-dimensional star map on board the UFO. Amateur astronomers have interpreted two of the larger stars in the map as being close (i.e. closer to home of the aliens), and have by a further set of arguments (flawed by an omission of binary stars from their maps) given an interpretation that in- cludes the sun as one of the background stars. But, no one knows either the map scale, the point of origin of the view, or the degree of im- plied change in scale with distance. Thus, given the number of stars and the number of ways to look at them, there is a vanishingly small chance that the two larger stars were representations of Zeta Reticulum 1 and 2. It is as if an illiterate person were to choose a map at random from 50 maps of the states and somehow try to interpret the highway configuration in a corner of one of them as having meaning relative to where he lived. There is little reason to think that Zeta Reticulum has any higher probability of being a home for aliens than any other star. Never- theless it had entered the UFO folklore and was available to Cooper in constructing his story. \"Krll... was the hostage left with us at the first Holloman landing as a pledge that the aliens would carry out their part of the basic agreement reached during that meeting. Krll gave us the foundation of the Yellow Book which was completed by the GUESTS at a later date. Krll became sick and was nursed by Dr. G. Mendoza who became the expert on alien biology and medicine. Krll later died. GUESTS were aliens exchanged for humans who gave us the balance of the Yellow Book. At the time I saw the information there were only three aliens left alive ...\" (page 296). Analysis: UFO research workers are MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"12 familiar with many instances in which aliens are able to paralyze humans and to enter secured areas. So it is hard to believe that hostages could be held against such power. If it is true, as is claimed in Cooper's report, that UFO aliens have been abducting humans at will since long before 1972 and have complete control over one in 40 persons, why would they want or need to give their own personnel as hostages? • \"Murder: The documents stated that many military and government personnel had been terminated (murdered without due process of law) when they had attempted to reveal the secret\" (page 297). • Analysis: This itself is not entire- ly unbelievable. Ms. Howe believes Cooper has (as of June 1989) gone underground to avoid the very murder he describes in his report and has told me that Cooper has received death threats and is very afraid for his life. She also indicated that until several months after the release of his report Cooper had a job (not the one he describes) where he would have had to reveal his social security number (which number is contained on his Navy discharge, included in the book). Thus any competent in- telligence agency could have found him. Furthermore, if a government in- telligence agency intended to do Cooper bodily harm it is not likely it would issue death threats; instead, Cooper would simply have disap- peared by now. In a later part of his report Cooper states that there is a contingency plan to contain or delay the release of in- formation. \"This plan called for the use of MAJESTIC TWELVE as a misinformation ploy to delay and con- fuse the release of information should anyone get close to the truth\" (page 298). It should be noted that Cooper should have been aware, in 1989, that other informers had earlier claimed the secret agency was called MA- JESTIC TWELVE. Thus his claim that the use of MAJESTIC TWELVE was planned misinformation may itself be misinformation intended to advance a claim that his report is more credi- ble than those of his earlier rivals. Meaning? To believe Mr. Cooper's story one must believe, beyond a reasonable doubt, each and every of a number of his statements. If any one of them represents a fabrication, the logical conclusion is that the rest may be fabrications, or may be either true or false. In any case we cannot depend on Mr. Cooper to say which. To believe him we must believe each of the following statements: 1) A line officer in the Navy, even the Commander of the Pacific Fleet, would have a \"need to know\" about above top secret alleged diplomatic relations with aliens, and 2) A petty officer second class, not in Naval Intelligence, would be given access to materials far above top secret, and 3) The authors of the alleged \"Blue Book Report 13\" material are in- credibly unsophisticated about technical matters relating to atomic weapons, beam weapons, and sound waves, whereas we would expect them to be unusually competent, and 4) Aliens having a very sophis- ticated technology are not able to rescue their fellow citizens being held hostage, and 5) The inconsistencies in Cooper's claims are only mistakes, such as his claim that one of his specialties was Internal Security, and 6) That a naval discharge paper would contain blanks or dashes in areas where one always finds the reason for discharge, and 7) His statement that he was the \"Executive Director of (the) National Technical College\" as directed in a sworn and notarized declaration dated February 10, 1989 (a copy of which is on page 290) is only misin- formation intended to foil his being found and murdered and is not just a grand-sounding title intended to add credibility to his statements. [There is a \"National Technical College\" listed in Los Angeles, at 600 S. Spring Street, Suite 600, L.A. 90014, phone (213) 624-8937. When I telephoned them no one had heard of a Mr. William Cooper.] Conclusion A reasonable conclusion to this sorry story is that Mr. Cooper is either consciously attempting, to reap a degree of self-importance as a self- appointed \"information agent\" by publishing material he knows to be fic- titious, or that he is badly deluded, perhaps in connection with the reason for discharge deleted from the copy of his discharge papers published in Ms. Howe's book. This second hypothesis suggests that he may ac- tually believe some of what he has reported and has embellished it with material out of the UFO rumor mills. The statistical chance that any one person, chosen at random, is a self- deluded individual and would come up with these revelations is vanishing- ly small. But this is not the probabili- ty we must consider. For there is, after all, a rather high probability that one individual, out of millions of in- dividuals, would come forth with these revelations and would also ap- pear to be sane, sincere and be a per- suasive speaker. For the rest of us who are interested in finding truth amid all the lies and distortions being presented by those ridiculing UFO reality, sometimes with government complicity, there is an im- portant lesson: not everyone who seems to be on our side of the truth can be trusted to be adding to the truth. Cooper is just one of a large number of individuals who have made or are currently making astonishing claims; there is no easy way to assess whether a particular in- dividual is another Cooper, at least not short of a comprehensive evalua- tion similar to that above.

By Walt Andrus Ed Komarek, Jr., State Section Director in southern Georgia, has been corresponding with several UFO groups in the U.S.S.R. Recently, one of his correspondents, Mr. Yuri Stroganov in the Krasnodar Region, submitted a hand written report with four photographs of an apparent crop circle that his UFO group had in- vestigated near their town of Yeisk. The city of Krasnodar is located north of the Black Sea, near the small Sea of Azov in an agricultural area and northwest of the Caucasus Moun- tains. On June 27, 1990, Mr. Stroganov and his team of investigators, con- ducted an expedition to the place where the mysterious circle had ap- peared in a wheat field. The location is not far from their town of Yeisk. They arrived at 1950 hours and com- pleted their preliminary investigation by 2045 local time. None of the members of their team experienced any health symptoms, whereas the first visitors complained of headaches. The team found one male witness who reported that on June 20th at 3 o'clock a.m. he saw a white and blue luminescent light somewhat like a welding arc in this immediate area. The next morning the residents found a peculiar depression of the wheat stalks in the field. The people who found the depressed area refused to enter it due to fear of something unknown. The team of investigators elected to conditionally call this place a \"zone.\" Since a week had passed before the team of investigators, lead by Mr. Stroganov, arrived on the scene, there was ample evidence that many visitors had already left numerous physical traces at the site. The zone is in the form of an oval with the length measuring about 45 meters and the width 35 meters. The sides of the oval are shaped rather precisely. In the interior part of the zone or oval the stalks of wheat are depressed in a spiraled, counter- clockwise configuration.

Fund, Hoax FUFOR Report The highlight of this quarter for the Fund for UFO Research was receipt of Stanton Friedman's Final Report on Operation Majestic 12, which sup- ports the authenticity of documents outlining the recovery and analysis of the wreckage of a UFO and four alien bodies in New Mexico by the U.S. government in 1947. The investigation was made possi- ble by a grant of $16,000 — the largest ever awarded by a private UFO organization. In his report, Friedman notes that there is no evidence which proves the documents to be false, but many previously unknown details which point to their authenticity. Copies of the report were mailed to contributors of $50 or more to the Fund for UFO Research before being made available to the press and the public. Requests for copies of the report have exceeded those of any publication ever offered by the Fund. If you have not ordered your copy, or if you want additional copies to send to your representatives in the Con- gress, please write the Fund at Box 277, Mount Ranier, MD 20712. During Mr. Friedman's research into the MJ-12 matter, he uncovered new evidence and new sources of informa- tion related to the apparent crash of one or more UFOs and the recovery of alien bodies outside Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947. At the same time, Don Schmitt and Kevin Randle with the Center for UFO Studies were conducting an intensive investigation into the Roswell case. The Fund's Ex- ecutive Committee decided to invite leading investigators into the Roswell case, as well as other crash/retrieval cases, to Washington, DC, for a debriefing. The invitation also was ex- tended to first-hand witnesses and sources of information in these cases who might be persuaded to go \"on the record\" with their testimony. As the 2nd Quarter drew to a close, plans for the conference, called \"Crash II\" (since it was the second such meeting sponsored by the Fund) were being finalized. A report on the results of the conference will be made available to the Fund's supporters in the near future. Also during this period; the Fund decided to sponsor a new effort to provide reliable information on the UFO subject to the public through a 900 pay-per-call service. The UFOLine with nuclear physicist Stan Friedman can be reached by dialing 1-900-USA-UFOS (872-8367) on your touch-tone phone. The call costs $2.00 for the first minute and $1.00 per minute thereafter. Messages are updated weekly with reports on re- cent sighting reports, updates on the Roswell crash case, information on UFO abductions and other aspects of the UFO phenomenon. Callers have the ability to provide information on recent sightings or to obtain printed materials. The Fund is providing $3,000 to promote the UFOLine through distribution of a newspaper column to thousands of daily and weekly newspapers across the country. The Fund's Executive Committee and National Board of Directors recently approved the following Of- ficial Statement of Policy concerning the UFO phenomenon, in an effort to respond to questions from the press and public on where the organization stands on the UFO phenomenon. Your comments are welcome. Policy Statement On the basis of more than 40 years of consistent, close-range observa- tions of objects having radical ap- pearance and performance, it is reasonable to conclude that we are faced with a coherent phenomenon for which there is no conventional ex- planation. It is the purpose of the Fund for UFO Research to support all reasonable scientific efforts to learn the nature of this phenomenon. The patterns of UFO appearance and behavior strongly suggest that they are not merely misidentified natural phenomena. .In recent years, it has become apparent that this phenom- enon involves multiple aspects: • Extraterrestrial Hypothesis — While physical proof of the extrater- restrial origin of UFOs is not in the hands of civilian UFO investigators, there is a growing mass of evidence that points to the distinct possibility that some UFOs represent the presence in the vicinity of the Earth of a non-human intelligence. • \"Abductions\" — While recogniz- ing the bizarre content of so-called \"abduction\" reports, their unusual degree of consistency and supporting evidence suggests a physical, rather than a psychological, basis. Psycho- logical studies of \"abductees\" so far tend to rule out psychopathology as the cause of the reports. • UFO Crashes — In view of the impressive first-hand testimony of the July 1947 events in New Mexico, it appears increasingly likely that the remains of at least one crashed UFO were recovered by the U.S. Govern- ment. • Government Secrecy — The release of thousands of pages of previously classified official military and intelligence documents (whose very existence was long denied) make it clear that the U.S. Government con- cealed UFO information for several decades. There is no reason to assume that the policy of secrecy has ended. Journal Hoaxed In the August No. 268 issue of the Journal, this column carried a news notice to the effect that the American Psychological Association had formed a branch devoted to parapsycho- logical studies that would look into UFO and related phenomena.

Philip Klass called to inform the editor of the falseness of the state- ment, as did Don Berliner of the Fund for UFO Research, for which we are gratefully appreciative. The original hoaxer probably thinks this incident 'proves' something about the gullibility of ufology as a whole. After all, it's true we didn't take the time to follow up the original an- nouncement. On the other hand, it was reproduced on apparently official APA stationary. What it really demonstrates, how- ever, is that .we rarely have the resources to chase every lead we receive, and secondly, that we tend to operate on a fundamental basis of trust regarding those we do. We're sorry, then, that we were deceived, and apologize to our readers and subscribers who were so misinformed. We also regret that someone out there feels a need to be so duplicitous and underhanded. If we're not hap- py for you, we hope you'll understand that sentiment as well. And remember: you were found out. - DS Editorial Alternative Unable to attend the MUFON Pen- sacola Symposium this past July (I was off chasing Crop Circles in England, which was almost as ex- citing), I only recently learned of some of the closed-door discussions that took place which had to do with the Journal's format. The foremost of these (I'm still not sure whether it was a general consensus, mandate or recommendation) had to do with returning the cover logo to its original form. In other words, it was suggested that the MUFON acronym (for Mutual UFO Network) should appear all in capital letters, rather than in its present configuration, which, admit- tedly, makes it appear as an ordinary word rather than a corporate title. My original intention in altering the old format, which, incidentally, is not meant to be writ in stone, was twofold. First, there was the con- sideration of the Journal's title in terms of an element of design, and as only one among many that needed redesigning, I might add. Capitalizing both MUFON and UFO, as in MUFON UFO Journal, simply makes for an overbalanced appearance on the cover. The alternative is to capitalize the entire title: MUFON UFO JOURNAL, which struck me as rather bombastic. In addition, the eye doesn't read and interpret a breathless burst of captial letters quite as easily as when it has a few clues, both capital and lower case letters, with which to work. A second consideration was the fact that we were celebrating our 25th anniversary. In other words, MUFON is an established organization, not so much that we can take ourselves for granted, but certainly to the extent that we can begin to think of ourselves as a permanent backdrop of estab- lished ufology. By writing MUFON (the acronym), then, as Mufon, I hoped to announce our arrival in the modern lexicon in the same way that other corporate trademarks, whether acronyms or not, have passed from oddities of language into acceptable everyday use. Computer terminology is full of similar examples, as is English in general, including the absorption of trademarks like Xerox and Coca Cola into common usage. So when I first pasted up a layout using a capital UFO balanced on either side by Mufon and Journal, I was esthetical- ly hooked. I don't say it's absolutely and irrevocably right, only that as an overall design element it struck me as more than appropriate. Moreover, I don't think that any of our newer subscribers and readers are likely to object to or be confused by the new format. One of my primary obligations as editor, as I see it, anyway, is to im- prove, not impose, the look, feel and contents of the Journal. I glance back at the September issue (No. 269), for example, and feel only pride, in general, in terms of cover and con- tents, but particularly in regard to the quality of the photographic reproduc- tions inside, to the best of my knowledge, nowhere else so dramatically depicted. It's curious, to me, then, that a few people still find the odd detail to carp about when the overarching appearance and contents of the Journal have improved so dramatically over the past few years. A word of approval rather than criticism, on occasion, would be great- ly appreciated. - DS Arizona State Meeting Hal Starr, Arizona State Direc- tor, has announced their annual state-wide meeting will be held on Saturday, November 24, 1990 at 11 a.m. in Phoenix, AZ for all MUFON members, their guests and interested parties. The meeting will take place in the private meeting room behind the restaurant at Smitty's Super- market/Department Store at 34th Avenue and Bethany Home Road.

A quarterly IF JOURNAL is also available. Back to Britain for a moment. If you've been intrigued by all the newspaper and TV reports of the \"circles\" (and other formations) which have appeared in record numbers in the fields of England this year, you will certainly want to check out a new publication, THE CEREOLOGIST. This is the journal of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies and is very capably edited by veteran writer John Michell. The first issue is now available and U.S. subscribers may send the equivalent of £7.50 ($15.00, by my estimation) to: THE CEREOLOGIST - 11 Powis Gardens - London Wll 1JG, England. Highly recommended. Volume 1 of THE UFO EN- CYCLOPEDIA series (UFOs IN THE 1980s) is now available. Written by long-time UFO researcher Jerome Clark, this is the first of three (or possibly four) volumes which will cover Ufology from 1947 to the pre- sent. The present volume (unseen by me at this writing) is priced at $65.00 (yes, a bit steep, I agree!) and may be ordered from: Omnigraphics, Inc. - Penobscot Building - Detroit, MI 48226. It is certainly a monumental job to attempt an \"encyclopedic\" pro- ject of this sort and Clark is to be com- mended for having taken it on. While we hope to see all volumes brought out in less expensive paperbound edi- tions eventually, this first offering should be well worth your attention. The latest offering from Wendelle Stevens' UFO Photo Archives is an Italian case which should probably be called \"classic contactee,\" in the vein of Adamski and others. For those who feel — as I do — that such reports are well worth reading, UFO CONTACT FROM ANGELS IN STARSHIPS by Giorgio Dibitonto, William T. Sherwood and Wendelle C. Stevens is available for $14.95, plus $2.00 for postage. It may be ordered from: UFO BOOKS - Christine Stevens-Cox - P.O. Box 1053 - Florence, AZ 85232. And, if you saw Stevens' 1990 UFO Calen- dar and liked his idea of using color UFO photographs in this manner, you'll want to order his 1991 Calen- dar also. It is available from the same address for $9.95, plus $1.50 postage. The next book in line will be GEORGE ADAMSKI: THEIR MAN ON EARTH, which is the complete manuscript by the late Lou Zinsstag, portions of which were used in the book by Good & Zinsstag, GEORGE ADAMSKI: THE UNTOLD STORY. This will also be priced at $14.95, plus the $2.00 postage cost. A new book by Zecharia Sitchin is always to be welcomed and he now has one available from Avon Books, GENESIS REVISITED.

Unless noted, no sound, vibration or odor was detected. AH times listed are local. • Log #900701: 5/22/90, 10p.m. event near Jones, Oklahoma); in- vestigators Jean Waller and Dick Seifried. A family was watching TV when they noticed bright red, green and blue lights through a window. Proceeding outside, they observed a dark outline (cylinder or disc on edge) with a row of lighted windows emerg- ing from a distant treeline and pass- ing low and slowly across their path. Momentarily, a smiliar object ap- peared. Before moving out of view- ing range it cast a beam of light, il- luminating a circle of the grass near the witnesses. Duration was estimated as over one minute. [Note: Subse- quent dreams by family members revealed a possible previous abduc- tion sequence.] • Log #900704: 5/24/90, 11 p.m. event near North Huntingdon, Penn- sylvania); investigator Wayne Willis. A woman was walking her dog when she saw a dark, delta-shaped object, somewhat larger than a commercial prop-driven aircraft, with nine large white lights extending around the two leading edges. The rear edge was reminiscent of a boomerang curva- ture. The vehicle hovered 300 feet above the ground near powerlines, then left quickly and was lost from view. The witnesses sensed a vibra- tion while it was in proximity. Dura- tion was estimated as 30 seconds. • Log #900706: 7/26/89, approx- imate 10:30 p.m. event in rural Genesee County, Michigan); inves- tigator David Reinhart. Four teens were driving when they encountered a large object with multi-colored lights moving slowly 300 feet away and 100 feet over a cornfield. The object was described as larger than a house and silver-grey with a bottom-view outline resembling a three-bladed fan. A beam shone from the bottom toward the ground. Stopping the car, they watched for five minutes before the beam was extinguished and the vehi- cle rose and sped away. The farmer who owns the property declared that the object had paced his tractor dur- ing this time frame. • Log #900708: 5/19/90, 4:35 a.m. event in Warrior, Alabama); in- vestigator Todd Pierce. A woman was driving to work when she confronted six huge white lights approaching slowly at treetop level. She halted, at which point the object hesitated, then moved at jogging speed over her truck and into the distance until lost from view. As it passed overhead, she sensed a vibration. The vehicle was described as at least house-sized and consisting of two sections: The front section was trapezoidal, behind which was a broad, outwardly angling fuse- lage and blunt rear. Along the under- side was a strip composed of hun- dreds of red, green and blue lights. Duration was estimated as six to eight minutes. (See illustration.) • Log #900722: (12/10/89, 11:10 p.m. event in Concord, New Hamp- shire); investigator Vail Leach. A cou- ple was driving when they came upon a cylindrical object hovering near the road. It was described as 60-80 feet in length, with a silver-grey surface, a white light on either end, a blue light centered on top, and three portholes along the midsection. As they slowed, the vehicle moved rapidly up and away. Duration was estimated as one minute. • Log #900726: (2/21/90, 6:30 - 8:30 p.m. events near Boscawen, New Hampshire); investigators Vail Leach, Cheryl Powell, Brenda Daniels, Ken Foster, et al. In reaction to numerous reports from the area, a group of 12, including several inves- tigators, gathered at a freeway com- muter lot for a weekly sky watch. At 6:30 p.m., a group of three lights ap- proached in a \"v\" formation, stopped and hovered, then moved into a straight line. After three minutes, the lights retreated and were lost from view beyond a treeline. Two in- vestigators pursued by auto, spotted the lights again and attempted with- out success to videotape the lights before they veered out of range. Later, a large, pulsing, white ball of light neared the group and hovered over powerlines. An attempt to videotape was again unsuccessful due to mechanical difficulty. After four minutes, the anomaly rose up and split into two smaller white balls. A loud sound, likened to an aircraft engine, then emanated seemingly from the intruder, and two red lights were noted behind the white lights. Now apparently a solid object with- out a detectable outline, it banked and moved a short distance. A bluish white beam appeared, separated from the source and descended slowly to the ground. Next, a beam was di- rected toward the nearby town, whereupon many beams ascended from the ground into the source. The two red lights were extinguished and the two balls of light merged. The single ball then dipped below the treeline.

The investigators had gathered at the usual commuter lot along with a Concord policeman, other adults and several students. Six white and three green lights in a checkmark formation ap- proached, slowly rotated, then retreated. Duration was estimated as 12 minutes. • Log #900735: (4/30/90, 9:30 and 9:45 p.m. events in and near Gulf Breeze, Florida); investigator Joe Bar- ron. Two teenaged girls were driving when they noticed a horizontal, box- shaped object, roughly 30 feet by 15 feet, approaching from the opposite direction before halting nearby and assuming an upright attitude. The ob- ject was further described as having a row of red circular lights around the lower edge and a smaller white light centered on the bottom; The entire surface emitted a dim glow. Stopping their car within 15 feet, the driver departed the car at which point the object ascended, again assumed a horizontal attitude, and slowly glided out of sight. Duration was two to three minutes. At 9:45 p.m., a retired FAA air traf- fic controller was driving home, five miles outside Gulf Breeze, when he spotted what looked like an oversized box kite (estimated to be larger than a full-sized auto) just above treetop level and moving slowly. A white light was noticed on one end. The object changed direction and ascended up and away. Duration was one minute. • Log #900736: (12/21/89, ap- proximate 1 a.m. event near Mar- tinsville, Indiana); investigator Norma Croda. Returning home from a trip, a couple noticed a circle of yellowish- orange lights around a hovering ob- ject of undetermined outline in the near distance. After passing by, they turned around to gain a better view. Upon their approach, the object left over a ridge, the lights extinguished as it went. Resuming their journey, the couple had driven seven miles farther when they encountered a huge vehicle hovering close by. Dull metallic, it ap- peared as large and with the general shape of a barge. The vehicle was angled downward. An illuminated dome protruded from the far end, while two searchlights shown from the near side. They stopped the car. Momentarily, the craft moved closer, at which point the man and woman sped away. Duration was estimated as one to two minutes for each episode. [Note: An electrical generating plant was subsequently located beyond the ridge in the first encounter and ma- jor powerlines were immediately below the object in the second episode.] • Log #900742: (September 1965, 1:45 a.m. event in Litchfield, New Hampshire); investigators Kathleen Morel, Jean Waller, Richard Seifried and Dr. Jeannie Byrne. [Note: The account emerged from the conscious recollections of two of the six witnesses in addition to the testimony of one under regressive hypnosis ad- ministered by Dr. Byrne.] Five siblings and one cousin all awoke in their bedroom at the same moment. The room was filled with a heavy, bright red mist, stifling in terms of its heat and humidity. The apparent source was beyond a high window in the room. They then heard the rat- tling of metal trap doors on the far side of the house which led to a cel- lar. As the oldest, the seven-year-old girl (and recent hypnosis subject) was urged by the others to lead them in- to the kitchen, beyond which were the locked trap doors, to determine whether there was an intruder. Pulling a chair to the kitchen sink, she pulled open the window curtain and confronted the face of an entity (drawn under hypnosis as a typical \"grey\") who was standing on the trap doors, looking up at her. Startled, the girl leaped down. But the others, not having seen the face and being curious, opened a door to the outside. The girl next recalled be- ing outside with her six-year-old male cousin, staring at a domed disc hover- ing just above a sandy area of their property. The same or an identical en- tity was standing in distant shadows. The two children were compelled to walk toward the vehicle, at which point they were levitated through an opening on its underside and into a brightly lit room. Each was prone and paralyzed on an examining table/platform. An entity then per- formed an undetermined procedure on the girl's lower body, using an in- strument likened to a long pencil, on the end of which was a tiny ball with needle-like extensions. When the procedure was com- pleted, the two were levitated back through the bottom entrance and dropped onto the ground. They ran back into the house where they Continued on page 23 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Looking Back 19 Bob Gribble October 1955 • One of the most powerful U.S. Senators in modern history actually eyewitnessed two UFOs while on a fact-finding trip through the Soviet Union. The en- counter is detailed in 12 top secret CIA, FBI and Air Force reports. Senator Richard B. Russell, Jr., then chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was on a Soviet train on the fourth when he sported a disc- shaped craft taking off near the tracks. He called his military aide and inter- preter to the window, and they saw the disc plus another one that ap- peared a minute later. The astonished trio reported the sightings to the U.S. Air Force as soon as they were out of the Soviet Union. \"The three observers were firmly convinced that they saw a genuine flying disc,\" according to an Air Force Intelligence report dated October 14, 1955, and classified Top Secret at the time. The documents describing the Senator's encounter were kept from the public for nearly 30 years. Still, a lot of people were aware of the inci- dent. For example, Mr. Tom Towers, in a January 20, 1957 column of \"Aviation News\" for the Los Angeles, California Examiner, printed the con- tents of a letter from the Senator in response to a request for information about the 1 sighting. Towers requested permission to \"break\" the story. The letter was dated January 17, 1956, and stated: \"Permit me to acknow- ledge your letters relative to reports that have come to you regarding aerial objects seen in Europe last year. I received your letter but I have discussed this matter with the affected agencies of the Government and they are of the opinion that it is not wise to publicize this matter at this time. I regret very much that I am unable to be of assistance to you.\" The Air Force Intelligence report says Russell and his two traveling companions, Ruben Efron, his inter- preter, and Col. Hathaway, his aide, all spotted the craft while traveling by rail across the Soviet Transcaucasian region. \"One disc ascended almost vertically, at a relatively slow speed, with its outer surface revolving slow- ly to the right, to an altitude of about 6000 feet where its speed increased sharply as it headed north.\" The se- cond disc was seen performing the same actions about one minute later. Russell saw the first craft ascend and pass over the train. Hathaway got to the window in time to see the first, while Efron got only a short glimpse of same. All three saw the second craft. Commenting on his experience, Col. Hathaway noted that \"we've been told for years that there isn't such a thing, but all of us saw it.\" • The results of an investigation begun by the Air Force in 1947 of Unidentified Flying Objects were released by the Air Force on the 25th. The report was based on an analysis conducted by a private scientific group under the supervision of the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Dayton, Ohio. Secretary of the Air Force Donald A. Quarles said: \"On the basis of this study we believe that no objects such as those popularly described as flying saucers have overflown the United States.\" Commenting on the Air Force report, Edward J. Ruppelt (former director of Project Blue Book) said: \"Probably the most astounding part of the press release, at least to me, was the statement that a report 'bas- ed on a study by a private scientific group under the supervision of the Air Technical Intelligence Center' con- cluded that all but a very few UFO sightings could be explained. This was a shock to me because I was the one that had this study made ... This is not a good study. I was out of the Air Force by the time that the report was published in its final printed form but I saw the unpublished draft and had written it off as worthless. Another in- teresting point is that the report was finished in September 1953 and it wasn't released as the 'latest hot dope' until October 1955.\" • 1960 At 6:10 p.m. on the fourth, minutes after residents of Cressy, Launceton, Australia, reported a mysterious explosion, the Reverend and Mrs. Lionel Browning spotted a gray, cigar-shaped object. There were four vertical bands along the side of the craft, and at the front end a rod with what appeared to be a small pro- peller at the end jutted out. The wind was loud and no sound was heard above it. The speed of the vehicle was estimated by Reverend Browning at about 500 miles per hour. After almost a minute of steady movement the craft stopped in mid-air, hovering about three miles away. The Brown- ings watched the vehicle for another 30 seconds, then were surprised to see five or six small disc-shaped ob- jects appear out of the clouds above and behind the larger craft. The discs were traveling very fast and the Brownings compared their movement to \"flat stones skipping along the water.\" The small craft sta- tioned themselves beside the larger ship within a half mile radius. The minister said they were about 30 feet in diameter. \"After several seconds,\" he reported, \"the large ship, accompanied by the smaller vehicles, reversed the way they had come.\" The objects were gone from sight within 30 seconds. Reverend Browning was interviewed at length by Royal Australian Air Force intelligence officers.

He was driving on a blacktop road about four miles east of town. As he came around a curve he saw an upright, rocket-like object straddling the road. It was about 30 or 40 feet high, about 10 feet in diameter, \"and seemed to be resting on legs or fins,\" he said. \"My car engine, lights and radio went out and I slammed on my brakes. 1 stopped about 20 feet in front of it. My first thought was to knock it over with the car so I could have some evidence, but the engine was dead. Then I got out with the idea of trying to push it over by hand. \"When I got to the front of my car three creatures that looked like in- dividual tin cans on tripods, and were about sixty inches tall, came from behind the rocket. They didn't have eyes that I could see but I knew they were looking at me. I stopped. I didn't have any desire to get closer. There was no sound, just dead silence. It seemed like ages as we looked at each other. Then they went up into the rocket, which had a bright, color- less light glowing out of the bottom. There was a loud hum. The rocket went up and disappeared. When the light on the bottom went out after it was in the air my car radio and lights came on, and my engine started without having to touch the starter.\" Townsend said his heart was poun- ding and his legs were like rubber. \"I drove 90 miles an hour back to Long Prairie to report what I saw. I was sure of two things: the rocket was a spaceship of some kind and the three objects that came out of it were creatures like nothing else in the animal world I have ever seen. They definitely were not people as I know them.\" The next day Long Prairie police officer Lavern Lubitz and Sheriff Jim Bain accompanied Town- send back to the landing site. \"The only thing we found were three strips of an oil-like substance on the road,\" Lubitz said. \"They were about a yard long and four inches apart, all parallel with the road.\" Lending credence to Townsend's story was Leonard Loken, who lives in the same general area. Loken said he and his son, Jim, were out hunt- ing raccoons with dogs on the same night. When the dogs hit the trail of a raccoon, Loken told his son to go back to the road and move the pickup to another spot while he followed the dogs through the corn field. Sudden- ly, there was a bright light shining on him which he thought was a game warden with a spotlight on the near- by road. Then he realized the light was above him. He said it brightly il- luminated an area the size of a foot- ball field and seemed to be at treetop level. Asked how bright the light was, Loken replied that it was so bright you could see a grasshopper hopping through the grass. His son Jim saw the same light from the road. Kent Johnston, Jr., said that at about the same time he saw a similar light over a field near Brainerd. The Reverend B.C. Siewert said a fellow pastor in Hewitt was traveling to Long Prairie on Highway 71 the same night and saw a bright light moving across the sky. He said the pastor turned off on country roads and followed beneath it until he came to a dead end. Townsend later reported that the Air Force had called his parents at Coon Rapids, and said for them not to talk about their son's experience, \"to keep the lid on.\" In conclusion, said Townsend: \"I usually meet emergencies without losing my head, but this scared me like I've never been scared before.\" • 1975 Robert Suffem of Three Mile Lake said a \"spaceship\" landed about 13 miles NW of Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada, on the seventh and he almost ran over one of its occupants with his car. Suffern said the ship was about 12 to 14 feet in diameter, nine feet high, and circular in shape. \"There was a black strip running around the circumference and what looked to be a small platform at the bottom of the vehicle.\" Suffem said he encountered the craft while driving around, to investigate \"a glow in the sky\" seen by his sister, who lives-near- by and telephoned him to say she thought his barn might be on fire. The vehicle was parked on a cot- tage road that led to the lake. He said that a few seconds after he saw it, the ship lifted straight up from the road in front of his car. \"There was no dust raised, no apparent thrust, nothing. It went straight up and over the trees.\" Suffern said he then turned his car around and headed back home. When he reached the top of a hill he had to slam on his brakes to avoid hit- ting \"some sort of creature.\" The creature, he said, was the height of the car fender and dressed in silver. It had two legs, two arms, a globe-shaped helmet and walked \"sort of like a midget.\" His helmet was slightly lighter in color and his spacesuit was like tin foil that had been crushed and flat- tened out. The creature turned, took three or four steps, vaulted over a fence and disappeared. Suffern said he raced back to his house, arriving in time to see the craft hover near his home before crossing the lake. He said he was badly shaken by the incident. \"It's alright to think what you would do if you came face to face with a situa- tion like this,\" he said, \"but when it actually happens, you are scared because you are dealing with the unknown. I mean, what do you do if they come to the door, offer them a beer?\" • John T. Struble also said he was \"damned scared\" after sighting a UFO about 25 miles NW of Helena, Mon^ tana, in the vicinity of Fletcher Pass at 12:30 a.m. on the 17th. According to Struble, a large craft about 50 feet in diameter, and from 25 to 30 feet high, passed over his truck from the rear, hovering approximately a hun- dred yards ahead of him for about five minutes. Struble said all the power in his truck went out, including the lights and engine.

With such a large portion of the recent MUFON Symposium taken up with Bible quo- tations and such like, I cringe at the prospect of a whole issue of the Jour- nal devoted to religious matters. Ar- ticles of this nature bring us no closer to an understanding of the UFO phenomenon, nor do they contribute to the collection, evaluation and publication of the UFO sighting reports that MUFON was originally founded to investigate. They must also discourage the very scientists, academics and profes- sionals we sorely need from member- ship and participation. Can you, without embarrassment, give a copy of the 1990 Symposium Proceedings to a friend or co-worker as an in- troduction to a \"scientific\" organiza- tion engaged in \"a concentrated scien- tific study by dedicated investigators and researchers\" (words quoted from page 6 of the Proceedings)? I can't. Let's have a moratorium on articles which are primarily a statement of their author's religious beliefs adjusted to embrace some concept of UFOs. Everybody has an opinion; let's get back to seeking out and printing the facts. — Jerold R. Johnson Austin, TX Dear Editor: On behalf of Dan Wright's letter in the July 1990 MUFON Journal re- garding the success of our Pensacola symposium, I would like to add my own salute to the Florida MUFON people for their outstanding efforts in organizing an event that has spoiled me for any future conference unless it is held in Pensacola! The only stone I left \"unturned\" was not carrying a camcorder for film- ing the Gulf Breeze UFO bus tour. However, I am presently searching out any individual who taped most of the tour. I am willing to pay a good price for a copy of this videotape and this includes postage and mailing. Any interested party can reach me at: Joan Laurino, 4340 Kirkham Street, San Francisco, CA 94122. Again, thanks for the wonderful UFO symposium which shall be remembered for a long time! — Joan Laurino San Francisco, CA Dear Editor: I would like to point out some prob- lems with Paul Fuller's letter in the September Journal where he dis- cusses his survey of 32 meteorolo- gists. His numbers show that 41% of the respondents support Meaden's vortex crop circle theory. The other 59% are either against, undecided or \"prepared to consider.\" The latter is no declaration of support; it is only when they have considered that their opinions can be tallied. So we have two-fifths for, versus three-fifths against, undecided or unprepared. Fuller's implied groundswell of sup- port is a mirage. But these numbers and percen- tages are meaningless in any case, because 32 scientists are not enough to be a representative sample. Fur- thermore, Fuller provides us with no information on his polling technique. How did he select who got the poll? What groups do the respondents belong to? What kind of people are most likely to respond? How were the questions phrased? The poll is too carelessly conducted to say anything valid about the scientific community. Not only is Fuller's conclusion a mirage, so is his data. But let's pretend for a moment that Fuller's poll is well-conducted, repre- sentative, and shows massive support for Meaden's theory. Even then, has anything been proved? Hardly. In 1500, had physicists been polled about the mechanics of the solar system, or chemists about the com- position of matter, or doctors about disease transmission, most would have voted confidently for the Ptolemaic system, the four elements, miasmas and night air. Scientists to- day are more sophisticated, but they still have no automatic access to truth — as the great debates over evolution, the lumineferous ether, cold fusion, polywater and the Piltdown man show. The universe is too various to be solved simply by opinion polls. Finally, Fuller's charge that Circular Evidence has \"countless blunders\" misses the mark. For one thing, Fuller fails to produce this army of blunders. Until he does, the charge is hot air. He does mention one \"blunder\" (the fact that Circular Evidence does not say that some crops straighten up again.) About the crops, Fuller is right. But the more mature the crop is, the more likely it is to stay flattened. Young crops \"bounce back\" more readily. When Circular Evidence was written, circles tended to happen later in the growing season, and so in most of them, the plants stayed put. (\"Early Circles, though initally pronounced, always mean that the rapidly growing crop will tend to pick itself up again\" — The Cereologist, Summer 1990, p.5.) The \"blunder\" Fuller seizes on is merely a statement needing revision in the light of new facts. I would conclude that Fuller does neither himself nor Meaden much good with his approach. He would appeal to scientists, but his misleading surveys, unsubstantiated accusations, and aggrieved rhetoric only functions to wreck his credibility. If Fuller wants to be taken seriously by scientists, let him speak like one. — Michael Chorost Durham, NC Have a Viewpoint To Express? The Journal welcomes clips and comments.

Webb November 1990 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, retrograding westward in Taurus, is at its brightest and best placed for northern observers for the rest of this century. (Even though it was nearer and brighter two years ago, the planet this time is 25° higher in the sky than in 1988.) The red planet is nearest Earth on the 19th (48 million miles away) and then reaches opposition (exactly opposite the Sun) on the 27th, rising in the NE at sunset and remaining visible all night. In late November and early December, Mars, at magnitude -2.0, rivals Jupiter in brightness. For telescopic information, see the October \"Night Sky.\" Jupiter (-2.3), in Cancer, rises in the ENE about 10 PM in mid-November. The big world follows behind Mars by some 60°. Saturn (0.6), in Sagittarius, is SSW at dusk and sets in the WSW about 8 PM in midmonth. The ringed planet lies near the Moon on the 21st. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars sets in the NW around sunrise. Jupiter stands high in the south at dawn. It is about 1.6° above the quarter Moon on the 9th. Meteor Shower: While full moonlight spoils observation of the South Taurids maximum early in the month, the Leonids will not suffer this fate during its peak on the morning of November 17. Radiating from the Sickle of Leo, this swiftest of all meteor showers (44 miles per second) results in bright bluish meteors, nearly half of which leave behind trains (persistent glowing wakes). However, the Leonids number only about 15 per hour in an average year. Moon Phases: Full moon — November 2 (Hunter's Moon) Last quarter — November 9 New moon — November 17 First quarter — November 25 The Stars: During midevening hours the autumn sky symbol, the Great Square of Pegasus, dominates the southern sky. Pegasus is one of six constellations involved in the royal family legend; all six are prominent this month. According to the Greek myth, Cepheus (hard-to-find upside-down \"house\" in the north) and Cassiopeia (crooked \"M\" high in the north) ruled Ethiopea. The queen boasted about her beauty, offending the sea nymphs. Poseidon, the sea god, punished Cassiopeia by sending the monster Cetus (sprawl- ing dim pattern in the south) to ravage the coast of Ethiopea. Cepheus tried to appease the monster by chaining his daughter Andromeda (twin row of stars running NE from the Great Square) to a rock as a sacrifice. But the champion Perseus (\"fishhook\" high in the NE), returning from his battle with Medusa, flew down on the back of Pegasus and displayed the head of Medusa. That creature's stare turned Cetus to stone, and the princess was rescued. BACK, Continued having green flashing lights. \"The whole canyon was lit up bright as day,\" he said, adding that he just sat \"frozen\" the whole time the craft was in view. As soon as the vehicle left, the power in his truck came back on. Later that evening his eyes were still bothering him as a result of the spotlight's glare. Struble had been driving a cement truck between Helena and Kalispell for more than three years. • 1980 About 9 p.m. on the 23rd, Randell Rogers, Larry Mortensen, Joe Nevarez, Kent David and James Best, noticed a strange object approaching the small mining town of Morencia, Arizona, site of two huge copper smelters. They were amazed to see a boomerang-shaped craft approaching the north smoke stack of the smelter area. After arriving at a position direct- ly over the north stack, it stopped and hovered for a minute or so, then came straight down to an estimated altitude of 700 to 1,000 feet. After a brief period of time, a brilliant light shone from the forward apex of the vehicle directly down into the interior of the north smelter stack. The witnesses described this light as brighter than a searchlight or that of an arc welder. Approximately 10 seconds later, the brilliant beam went out and the craft began moving south at the same altitude and stopping directly over the south smelter stack. Again the brilliant beam came on and shone into the in- terior of the stack. Shortly thereafter the light beam turned off, and the vehicle moved slowly to the south. Then, \"in less than the blink of an eye\" it accelerated to a speed which the witnesses were not able to estimate, in the direction of Safford. At that point Joe Nevarez stated that he wished that the thing would come back so he could get a better look at it. Immediately, as if in response to an unspoken command, the craft per- formed an instant reversal from its position over Safford, returning to the slag dump area of the smelter. Then it accelerated out of sight to the north. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"23 MESSAGE, Continued Skip D.

CURRENT LOG, Continued discovered the other children, who were likewise scared and excited. Through a window, they spotted two more identical craft hovering nearby. They returned to their bedroom and resumed their sleep. Upon waking in the morning, all realized that their night clothes were damp, as were the bedsheets. Their aunt soon arrived and angrily as- sumed they had all wet their beds. The girl determined that her sheet was neither discolored nor odorous. Their claims of having seen a spaceship went unheeded. A few of the children soon went outside to play and discovered a large circular depression in the sandy area. [Note: Years later, the mother recalled that she awakened and noticed a reddish SOVIET CIRCLE, Continued touched wheat also in the form of an oval measuring 2 meters by 1.5 meters. The zone or large oval is ar- ranged with the big axis pointing north and south and the island axis from east to west. In the zone one can see two ringlike paths each 40 centimeters wide. The two ringlike paths are also separated by 40 centimeters. The center of these two paths do not coincide with the center of the zone itself. The paths are distinguished from the large circle by the brighter color of the stalks. The stalks in the paths appear to be more dense than the rest. The wheat in the remainder of the field and in the zone was green except the stalks in the center and in the paths. They des- cribed their appearance as looking as if they had been threshed. Radiation measurements were made with the help of an Army dosimeter model DP-5. The level of radiation in the oval area was the same as the background level, whereas on the brighter paths it was near to null. They speculated that the paths were somewhat screened. The team of investigators hypothesized that the strange effects suggested a visitation by a UFO. Soil samples and wheat stalks were taken for analysis. Research into this mysterious event is continuing. Mr. Komarek has asked that soil samples be mailed to him so analysis may be conducted in a laboratory in Georgia. As an aid to Yuri Stroganov, Ed Komarek mailed their team a MUFON Field Investigator's Manual which they are presently having translated into Russian. Since they cannot purchase MUFON publica- tions with their currency of rubles, they are being mailed a complimen- tary subscription to the MUFON UFO Journal. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 270 October 1990"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"i Director ) s ^Message Walt Andrus As a UFO investigative organiz- ation, we urge State and State Sec- tion Directors to conduct training meetings for Field Investigators, utiliz- ing the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual as a guide along with visual aids. In addition to the topics and techniques stressed in the manual, there are other subjects related to UFO investigations that can be pro- vided by a high school physics book in order to prepare for the examina- tion. These areas involve light and op- tics, sound, measurements, elec- trical/magnetic effects, photography, radio and radar, celestial objects, at- mosphere and weather, conventional vehicles, witness reactions, and the UFO experience. The instruction course should be taught by a trained investigator, a group of investigators or the person assigned the responsibility of Chief Investigator for the group. At the con- clusion of the training meetings, the MUFON Field Investigator's Exam should be administered to the graduates in order to upgrade trainees to Field Investigator status. A supply of examinations with blank answer sheets are available from MUFON in Seguin, Texas. The exam is an \"open book\" test with no time limit estab- lished. I am aware that such sessions have already started or are planned for Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, Texas. Dan Wright has acknowledged the receipt of considerably more UFO reports during this calendar year as compared to the previous year. This is not due to a flap or wave of UFO sightings, but the simple fact that MUFON has more trained inves- tigators in the field to investigate and prepare reports. State and State Sec- tion Directors have been making themselves visible and available to the news media, thus people know where to report sightings. This may be com- pared to the old riddle — when a tree falls in the forest is there any sound? Of course there is, only no one was around to hear it. The same applies to UFO sighting reports. We receive the most reports from the states and counties that are represented by section directors and field investi- gators. State Newsletters In states where MUFON has active State Directors most of these leaders publish a monthly, bi-monthly or even quarterly newsletter as a customized communications medium for all of their state members. Some of these are very professional, employing per- sonal home computers for desktop publishing, whereas others are typewritten then printed with a copy- ing machine. Formats may vary wide- ly, but each provides a means of com- municating with your members. Ob- viously, postage, paper and publishing costs to perform this service become a factor. Some states have a small membership subscription fee to defray these expenses, which is highly recommended, since the State Direc- tor or his/her editor is already volunteering their time to this project. Most State Directors exchange copies of their newsletters with others pro- ducing similar publications, thus sup- plementing far more specific state in- formation than the MUFON UFO Journal is capable of providing. To complete the circle, Dan Wright, your Regional Director, and MUFON headquarters would appreciate being placed on your state newsletter mail- ing list. Western Regional Director's Election All members/subscribers in the Western Region of States received a ballot with their September 1990 MUFON UFO Journal in which they were asked to cast their ballot for one of three people to represent them on the MUFON Board of Directors. The candidates in alphabetical order are Robert J. Gribble, Virgil (^. Staff and Judy Tuberg. Please return your ballot to MUFON by October 31, 1990.

Komar, Ten- nessee State Director, a set of 45 slides has been assembled, including a narrative script designed for State Directors, Assistant State Directors and State Section Directors, or for making public UFO lectures to schools, church groups, service clubs and fraternal organizations. Twenty- five sets were sold at the Pensacola Symposium, with a limited number still available for the above classified members only. Please write and send a check for $20 to John W.
