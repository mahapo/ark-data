T his paper examines the legal ramifica- tions and possible repercussions of killing an alien. My legal research has indicated that there is no body of law that is directly in point on this issue. The legal as- pects of this matter will have to be founded on analogous areas of the law. Much of this is supposition, speculation and theory. Additionally, the civil and criminal ramifi- cations of killing an alien will depend on the facts and circumstances of how the alien was killed and perhaps even on what type of alien was killed. Finally, this is not exhaus- tive of the issue. There appear to be several fundamental issues. First, is an alien considered to have similar legal status to a \"human being\" or should the alien be treated like an \"animal\" for the purposes of homicide and manslaughter statutes? Secondly, if the killing of an alien is analogous to killing a human or an animal, under what circum- stances would it be excusable or justifiable? What, if any. civil remedies would be avail- able to the alien's surviving family or civi- lization and how could you hold the govern- ment responsible?

A per- son who is in imminent peril of death or great bodily harm has the right to kill to protect him- self. April 1997 Number 348 Page 4 malice aforethought, it is murder, without malice, it is manslaughter (18 United States Code 1111, 1112). Twill assume that the perpetrator intended to kill the alien. If the alien is a human being, the offense would be murder, the most serious felony punish- able by death or life imprisonment. There area number of different types of aliens, in- cluding the Nordics, Reptilians, and the Greys. Some types like the Nordics have been reported to resemble humans in physi- cal appearance. In fact, the Nordics have been variously described as being extremely handsome or beautiful. Even the Greys and Reptilians ha\\e been described as having humanlike features, although some believe that the Greys may be robots or automatons. Most of I he al len lypes described appear to be highly intelligent, having an ability to reason and an intellectual capacity far be- yond the average human. Various definitions of the word \"human\" or \"human being\" stress having human form, having the ability to reason and to use logic and having human or \"humane\" char- acteristics, such as compassion and sympa- thy for others (Merriam Webster Dictionary, 1994 Edition). A strong argument could be made that the unlawful killing of an alien being who has such characteristics should subject the perpetrator to punishment simi- lar to the punishment for the crime of homi- cide. This is especially true if the primary policy behind the sanctity of human life de- pends on special attributes like intelligence and humane traits. Still, it might be easier to make this argument if a Nordic type alien was killed, rather than a Reptilian or other alien type not having similar human charac- teristics or not as benign. The law recognizes a terrestrial alien (foreigners) as having legal status as a hu- man being. From all reported evidence, most extraterrestrial aliens would probably be considered intelligent entities who would be entitled to protection from being wrong- fully killed as ambassadors or officials of their planets or civilizations. Murder or manslaughter of foreign officials, official guests, or internationally protected persons is a homicide under federal law (18 United States Code 1116). Shouldn't we extend the same protection to intelligent extraterrestrial aliens that we extend to terrestrial aliens? Even if an alien is not a human being and is not entitled to the protection of laws pro- hibiting homicide, other laws protect most life forms from destruction. These laws range from those environmental laws pro- tecting even some end.iiigcied lower forms of animal life from desnui_tion, viz. the Rio Grande silvery minnow, to animal cruelty laws in general (Endangered Species Act 16, United States Code Annotated 1531- 1543). The killing of most domesticated and wild animals, other than those bred for slaughter like sheep and goats, is a crime. In Texas, it is a Class A misdemeanor punish- able by up to a $4000 fine, up to one year in the county jail, or both (Texas Penal Code, Sections 12.21 and 42.09). In summary, the unlawful, unjustifiable killing of an alien would most probably constitute a crime under those criminal laws either protecting humans or animals from destruction. The next issue is to determine under what circumstances the killing of an alien would be justifiable. JUSTIFIABLE KILLING There are many circumstances under which the killing of an alien would be either justifiable or excusable. If the killing of an alien is justifiable then no crime has been committed. There is no criminal penalty. The first justifiable circumstance would be killing an alien on a field of battle during a war. Al first it seems that this \"War of the Worlds\" scenario would be far fetched. Yet when you consider the accounts of alien ab- duction, kidnappings, rapes, violation of air space and threats to the national security al- legedly caused by the UFO phenomenon, the killing of an alien by an officer or an employee of a government might be justi- fied. However, it could be difficult to use this defense since no government has offi- cially acknowledged the existence of ex- traterrestrial aliens, much less recognized them as a threat or declared war against them. A nother justifiable excuse is the protec- tion of property. In certain states, such as Texas, in limited circumstances a person has the right to take even a human life to protect his property. In case the law deems aliens should be treated more like animals than humans, it would be easier to justify the killing of an alien to defend property. Many states, like Texas, have found killings of animals justified to keep them from de- stroying crops, animals and other property {Jones v. State, 3 Cr. Rep. 228 (1877). So the farmer who kills an alien to protect his"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL crops from being destroyed (LJFO's have been linked with crop circles) or the rancher who kills a trespassing alien to prevent cat- tle mutilation could be exonerated by a court of law. Under some circumstances, a killing may be justified to prevent a breach of national security. Certain National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) employees as well as their agents and contractors are allowed to carry firearms and to make arrests to protect U.S. property and to prevent a felony (42 United States Code 2456). Although this stops short of a \"license to kill,\" many other gov- ernmental agencies may have similar au- thority. I have heard that signs around \"Area 51\" indicate that trespassers may be ex- pected to be repelled with deadly force. ] have not yet found the law that authorizes this, but would not give the survivors of a trespassing alien killed in \"Area 51\" much chance of having the perpetrators prose- cuted or of collecting civil damages. O ne of the most likely justifications is self defense. A person who is in immi- nent peril of death or great bodily harm has the right to kill to protect himself. When a human is the one posing the threat, the threatened person may have the duty to re- treat if he can do so safely. But in most cases if he believes his life is in danger he may legally kill. The threat does not have to be real. If the alien is reasonably perceived to threaten the person's life or limb, even if there was actually no real threat, the killing of the alien would be justified. Imagine the state of mind of a hunter, for instance, who confronts a UFO and an alien. Most experi- encers or abductees have described such close encounters of the third and fourth kind as terrifying events. Add to that the many reports of abductions, painful and terrifying physical examinations, accounts of injuries, permanent scars and disease as a result of these encounters. Not all contacts with aliens have been pleasant nor have all aliens been beneficent. Jacques Vallee describes numerous instances of serious injuries and several instances of UFO-caused deaths, in- cluding an incident in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in August I%(S where two men apparently met their dejlhs j$ the result of an en- counter with a UFO. (See Vallee, Jacques, Confrontations, Random House, 1990.) A jury could well conclude lhai aliens and alien encounters were duncenuis and that the hunter's killing of the alien was com- pletely justified on a theory of self defense. Finally, there is the defense of mental im- pairment or insanity. In order to be crimi- nally liable, the perpetrator must have a mental state, sometimes referred to as mal- ice aforethought or mens rea, where he knowingly intended to kill the alien. An in- sane person is not responsible for his ac- tions, in fact the traditional juror might think that you and 1 are not playing with a full deck for even discussing this topic. With the terrifying aspect of many alien en- counters described above, temporary insan- ity is a very viable defense. In summary, there are a number of justifi- able and excusable circumstances the law recognizes for killing a human being or an animal. Many of these defenses appear to be legally applicable to various scenarios under which an alien is killed and could com- pletely exonerate the slayer. CIVIL RESPONSIBILITY This is an area which I want to touch on briefly since I have not had much time to re- search it. The survivors and sometimes even the country of a person who is killed has the ability under civil law to seek reparations or restitution in the way of monetary damages for the wrongful death of a human being or an animal. The most obvious example of this is the recent success of the Brown and Goldman families in obtaining multimillion dollar civil damages against O.J. Simpson. There have also been instances of foreign governments paying damages for death caused and property destroyed when U.S. civilian aircraft were wrongfully shot down over their soil. Does this apply to the de- struction of an alien? ft could, even if, like in the Simpson case, the perpetrator is not found guilty of murder. This is because in a civil case the burden of proof, by a prepon- derance or greater weight of the evidence as opposed to beyond a reasonable doubt, is less. Certainly, the alien's relatives, his planet and his civilization have been dam- aged by his loss. If under civil standards of responsibility the killer of the alien fails to act as a reasonable man would have acted under the circumstances, and if his actions directly or proximately cause the alien's death, he could be forced to respond in civil damages. Intent to kill or malice is not re- quired to hold the perpetrator, the perpetra- The threat does not have to be real. If the alien is reasonably perceived to threaten the person's life or limb, even if there was actually no real threat, the killing of the alien would be jus- tified.

April 1997 Number 348 Page 6 tor's government or employer responsible If the alien is recognized as having a Iciial right not to be killed and he is killed mad- vertently through negligence, the civil law would award the alien's surviving family and perhaps his civilization damages as restitution for the civil wrong done. GOVERMENTAL IMMUNITY AND SUPREMACY Probably the most likely perpetrator would be an officer or employee of the fed- eral government. There are a number of governmental agencies like NASA involved in the exploration of space, including the Department of Defense. There is a National Commission on Space and a National Space Council, appointed by the President, and an Aeronautics and Space Strategic Plan which, among other things, has a goal of en- couraging space settlements and the estab- lishment of Space Station Freedom under an international agreement between the United States, Canada, Japan and the European Space Council. (Public Law 100.685 and 1989 Executive Order) Stated congressional goals include not only the study of other ce- lestial bodies and the establishment of space settlements but the development of an air- breathing single-slage-to-orbit long range hypersonic research flight vehicle, appar- ently capable of taking off from earth, trav- eling to outer space and returning to our planet in a single stage. (Public Law 101 - 611,Title 1,A116, 104 Stat. 3202) A proto- type of this so-called \"spaceplane\" is sup- posed to be developed by NASA working in conjunction with the Department of Defense, sometime this year. Obviously the government would be interested in obtain- ing a UFO, if they don't already have one, and studying its propulsion system. So it is much more likely that officials and employ- ees of the government would come in con- tact with a UFO and its alien occupants than a member of the public. The government also has the resources to destroy an alien whereas many abduction encounters indi- cate the average person is rendered helpless when encountering aliens. However, it would be extremely difficult to hold the government responsible for killing an alien. Having represented govern- mental entities, 1 can tell you that the fed- eral government has a number of defenses to both criminal and civil liability for its ac- tions that private individuals and corpora- tions do not have. Without going into detail, the defenses of governmental immunity, ab- solute immunity and qualified immunity would be very difficult to overcome in try- ing to hold the government legally responsi- ble for killing an alien. Finally, we are assuming our planetary laws are supreme. The doctrine of \"su- premacy of laws\" states that in case of a conflict the higher law governs. For exam- ple, federal laws would generally govern over conflicting state laws, and some inter- national laws would govern over federal laws. Tt would seem logical that beings more iniellii:enr than we have developed in- tergalaciK laus and treaties that would be supreme over our laws under which the slayer of an alien might be held responsible.

The images were taken by HST's Wide Field Planetary Camera-2 on March 10, 1997, just before Mars opposition, when the red planet made one of its closest to the Earth (about 60 million miles or 100 million km). These pictures were taken during three HST orbits that were separated by about six hours. This timing was chosen so that Mars, with its 24-hour 39-minute day, would rotate about 90 degrees between or- bits. This imaging sequence therefore cov- ers most of the Martian surface. These ob- servations will be combined with others planned for March 30 to provide complete coverage. During each orbit, Mars was observed in nine different colors spanning the ultraviolet to the near infrared. The specific colors were chosen to clearly discriminate between airborne dust, ice clouds, and prominent Martian surface features. The color picture shown here was created by combining im- ages taken in blue (433 nm), green (554 nm), and red (763 nm) colored filters. The Martian north pole is at the top (near the center of the bright polar cap) and East is to the right. The center of the disk is at about 23 degrees north latitude, and the central longitudes are near 160, 210, and 305 de- grees. These images show the planet on the last day of Martian spring in the northern hemi- sphere (just before summer solstice). The annual north polar carbon dioxide frost (dry ice) cap is rapidly sublimating, revealing the much smaller permanent water ice cap. This polar cap remnant, along with a few nearby detached regions of surface frost are most obvious in pictures taken through ul- traviolet, blue, and green filters. These fil- ters also show numerous bright water ice clouds. The brightest clouds are in the vicinity of the giant volcanos on the Tharsis Plateau (to right of center on left image), and in the giant impact basin, Hellas (near bottom of right-hand image), but a diffuse haze covers much of the Martian tropics as well.

Others will be included in the future. LOG # 960905SE: CE-J, 08/??/92, Franklin, GA, at 20:J5 hours, for 10 min- utes. Investigator: John C. Thompson While driving in a convertible southward on Bevis Road, two women saw multiple white lights, four red ones, and a center pulsing red light outlining the bottom of a round or square object just to the east and moving parallel to them. It soon disap- peared in the woods, but was out of sight for only a short time. They drove over a hill before reaching an intersection with Highway 219. As soon as the intersection was in view, they saw the object hovering just over the road, as if waiting for them. Having a distinct feeling they would be captured if they drove under the vehicle, one of the two women started to jump from the car, but the driver suddenly threw the gearshift into reverse and \"swerved into a nearby driveway.\" The object moved toward and over them, then away. The two reported the object to be about the size of a car, and it came within 100 feet of them as it departed, flying only a few feet above ground. LOG#960904SE: CE-J, 07/19/95, LaGrange, GA, at 22:30 hours, for 10 min- utes. Investigator: John C. Thompson and Steven Brown A total of eight witnesses, from two sepa- rate families, experienced an unexpected visit from a flying object one clear night in July 1995. Those closest to the object said they were out on their porch that evening and first saw a blinking light moving very fast high in the sky. Five minutes later, the main witness was jolted by screaming from her children. They saw an unusual, dia- mond-shaped object with a blue-green light at one end, a red light at the other, and a large soft-white light in the middle on the lower half. It was over the pine trees near their house and slowly dropped to an alti- tude of 50 feet as it approached. The main witness was in terror and hid behind their van with one of her children as the diamond shape moved almost directly over them. The object continued away, at a slow speed, and disappeared to their west. The surface of the object was \"dull steel to Navy ship gray,\" and its size was esti- mated to be about that of a minivan. A second family saw the object about five minutes later. Although seen at a dis- tance, their descriptions were enough to confirm those given by the first family. Checks with the police, airport, and oth- ers revealed no other reports had been made. LOG#960921SE: CE-J, 11/05/95, LaGrange, GA, at 21:30 hours, for 2 min- utes. Investigator: John C. Thompson Three witnesses viewed a ball of white and reddish light, like a \"ball of fire\" that was \"rolling.\" At a distance from the phe- nomenon, the third witness was driving to take a child home to its mother when he briefly saw what could be described as a fireball, or bolide. When the other two witnesses saw the object from their car, they dismissed it as an airplane, but, later, they saw it again while on another street. The object, described as about the size of a car's roof, was at an alti- tude of a telephone pole's height, and they had to drive under it in order to reach their house. The ball apparently moved over their house then upward and away. The light from the ball was too bright to make out a shape. As it ascended away, the light went out.

Early in his book Dr. Lewels refers to me as \"The foremost proponent of the God Hypothesis,\" which comes as no surprise to readers of the MUFON UFO Journal. There are three sections to the book with several chapters each. The first section is the \"Paradigm Shift\" in which Lewels re- lates his personal encounter with UFOs and those searching to understand them. He talks about his own concerns for religion, and the way in which orthodox religion, and orthodox science, failed to make sense of much that he encountered. Dr. Lewels' training as a journalist gives him the free- dom to ask questions that cross boundaries between many fields. THE PROBLEM OF MIND SET—ATOMIC OR QUANTUM? He discovers in quantum physics, and in the concept of the holographic universe, the metaphysical basis for thinking of the uni- verse as spiritual. We do not live in a Newtonian universe of colliding billiard balls, whether stars, or atoms. Rather, we live in an ocean with waves, in which all is connected, a quantum universe. I believe Lewels is right to suggest that modern physics makes a spiritual view of the uni- verse more believable to the scientific mind. And I think it fair to say most religious leaders are not aware of the implications of the new physics for spirituality. At the same time, I think it fair to say that many MUFON members who see themselves as scientists, have likewise not made the psychological transition from an atomic view of reality to a quantum view. Furthermore, I think that in our early UFO research, we had an atomic view of UFOs— I did. That is to say, we wanted to prove that UFOs were real solid objects, and if we did that, then we would prove they were real. In this sense, my own mind set at the begin- ning, was that of the late Maj. Donald Keyhoe, whose books I read while in high school in the 1950s. And it was from this view of UFOs that I wrote The Bible and Flying Saucers in 1968. I joined MUFON, and joined the quest to prove that UFOs were solid, and therefore real. Our enemies were those who said that UFOs were not real, they were a myth. Although 1 understood the validity of C. J. Jung's thesis in Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies (1958), I wanted to prove that UFOs were more than myth, that they were solid and therefore real, as real as the parting of the Red Sea, or the Resurrection of Jesus. But here is the bad news from quantum physics: reality is not solid. As a person who had majored in physics in college, and who liked his quantum physics courses best, I knew this intellectually. But I was not pre- pared for what this might mean spiritually, or for what it might mean in our UFO quest, and I am still not prepared. What we have discovered in UFO re- search is that there is a huge psychic dimen- sion to the UFO mystery.

As soon as we let psychic issues in the UFO door, can New Age Religion be far behind? The answer is: No. And from my point of view, I would rather this were not the case. Needless to say, when I was being trained in seminary to be a Presbyterian minister, rein- carnation and the Law of Karma were not orthodox topics. REVELATION, REVELATION, EVERY- WHERE Section Two of The God Hypothesis moves \"Toward a New Reality,\" in which issues of UFO abductions and aliens are ex- plored, the role of Eastern philosophy, near death experiences, and mind control are all explored. This section of the book is the most difficult for me. The difficulty is not that the issues addressed here do not need to be examined, but—how do we test for truth? In the religious professional world where I work, many religious leaders doubt that revelation from \"the other side\" has ever happened. Their view of religion is that we have created religion from our Jungian unconscious. In the world of UFOs and related top- ics—near death experiences, or past life therapy, for example—religious revelations are more common than cows in Texas. I am not sure which is worse—no religious reve- lation, or too much revelation. A little reve- lation—which gave us clear direction— would help. But from my point of view, we now have a blinding light of revelation at the end of the UFO tunnel. In Section Three of his book, Dr. Lewels explores \"Our Hidden History,\" and much of this section deals with issues I raised in The Bible and Flying Saucers: Moses and the Exodus in the Old Testament, and Jesus and UFO issues in the New Testament. In this section. Dr. Lewels concludes that Jehovah, the God of Moses, does not seem very God-like, both in his willingness to kill the Egyptian first-born at Passover, and or- dering the Jews to kill many of the occu- pants of the \"Promised Land.\" We live in a time when people are so ignorant of the Bible that they are shocked to discover the God of the Old Testament is a \"killer.\" Jack Miles in his best selling book God: A Biography (1996), argues that the personal- ity of God evolves from Genesis to Job, evolving out of the killer God of the Flood and Passover. The ethics of Jesus—love your enemy, turn the other cheek—seems more God-like to Dr. Lewels, but he also suspects that the Apostle Paul distorted Christian truth, which should have been more gnostic. But Dr. Lewels ignores Paul's conversion as a probable UFO event (Acts 9:1-9), or the possibility that Paul's interpretation of Christianity may have been dictated by some type of UFO abduction, or out of body experience (2 Corinthians 12:1-5). THE END OF ORTHODOXY—SCIENTI- FIC OR RELIGIOUS? After presenting his view of Jesus, Dr. Lewels realizes he is far from religious (or scientific) orthodoxy. \"And just as with the previous discussions of Jehovah and human origins, this interpretation is not likely to entirely satisfy either the materialists, the theologians or the fanatical true believers\" (p. 239). He is right about that, but I can hardly complain, for after all, I helped open Pandora's Box. I suspect many MUFON members will be uncomfortable with The God Hypothesis for both scientific and religious reasons. But at the same time I think most MUFON members no longer hold a simple extrater- restrial hypothesis. By simple, I mean I doubt many of us expect UFO aliens to land any day and say, \"Take me to your leader.\" We may believe UFOs are real, intelligent, and highly technological. But they also have a strange spiritual and psychic dimen- sion: the UFO reality may have even caused—deliberately—the Judeo-Christian religious tradition, as well as other religious traditions of the world. If this is true, then UFOs have in the past, and may still be, car- rying out a god-like role in our world, as Jacques Vallee has argued on purely scien- tific and historical grounds. To say only that UFOs are extraterrestrial is to make a mole hill out of a mountain. The God Hypothesis seeks to give UFOs a little more respect— but are we in danger of giving UFOs too much respect—respect that approaches wor- ship?

The little poltergeist girls reach for their wads of chewing gum. —Charles Fort Wild Talents N o one appreciates an advantage more than the military. Which explains why they will eventually try anything, especially anything relatively inexpensive. During WWII, for example, the Japanese launched an extensive/j/go balloon program aimed at the United States, discovering the jet stream in the process. Schoolgirls manufactured the balloons and the military armed them with bombs and sent them aloft, allowing the pre- vailing west-to-east winds over the Pacific to \"aim\" them in our direction. About 10,000 such fugos were launched, resulting in only a handful of casualties. So while the program may have been cheap, it was grossly ineffective in the bargain. On pur side there was a plan to attach small incendiary devices to hundreds of thousands of Mexican free-tail bats and re- lease them over Japan's main metropolitan areas, which were largely constructed of wood and paper. The theory was that the bats would roost under the eaves, the fire bombs would go off, and the cities would burn down. This project had its practical drawbacks, too, not to mention the fact that a far more efficient, if far more expensive, method of incinerating cities was soon de- veloped, resulting in the atomic bomb. That the military would eventually take an interest in so-called psychic powers like clairvoyance and psychokinesis should hardly come as a rude shock. One might al- most ask: what took so long? Scientific skepticism, leavened with orthodox ridicule, played a major delaying role, no doubt. Why investigate, however cheaply, that which could not possibly be? Politics played a role, too. Who wanted to risk embarrassment should word leak out that taxpayers' dollars were being spent on psychic research? When our own military did turn its atten- tion to the subject in the early 1970s, the main motivation seems to have been one of fear, fear that the usual cold war suspects and adversaries, the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries, were drawing far ahead of us in psychic \"warfare\" capabili- ties, opening yet another \"missile gap\" equivalent. Clearly the psychokinetic sce- nario envisioned above by Charles Fort was patently impossible. But what if other, less dramatic possibilities, existed, like, say, the ability to read classified documents at a dis- tance? Could we suffer the enemy any po- tential advantage merely out of scientific skepticism? Didn't we owe it to the Free World, if not ourselves, to find out whether or not there was anything to the growing ru- mors of voodoo warfare? It's at this point — research into remote viewing having been initiated in 1972 by"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL civilians Russell Targ and Hal Puthoff at the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California —that Jim Schnabel jump starts the imminently readable and immensely in- teresting Remote Viewers: The Secret History of America's Psychic Spies. Many of you will be familiar — if not necessarily in agreement — with Schnabel as the author of Round in Circles and Dark White, two previ- ous books devoted to crop circles and UFO abductions respectively. Schnabel has been roundly criticized in some circles for insert- ing himself into the story being told, al- though it's hard to see how that applies to his first book, which is a sort of I-was-there- confessional-cum-expose. At any rate, such criticisms will be harder to lodge against Viewers. Save for a brief first-person appear- ance in the book's Epilogue, in which Schnabel recounts his own remote viewing training at the feet of the acknowledged \"master\" of same, Ingo Swann, Schnabel as Schnabel is conspicuously absent from the present volume. As he says of his sources and subjects in the opening ''A Note to the Reader,\" \"This is their story, not a dramatic invention of mine.\" And what a story it is, replete with ego conflicts, government agency manueverings, political intrigues, striking psychic \"hits\" (and equally striking misses), bent spoons (and forks), and — did I forget? — UFOs. Famed Israeli \"psychic\" Uri Geller is here, along with Bob Monroe, founder of the Monroe Institute, and \"shadow\" figures like Albert Stubblebine, John Alexander, Lyn Buchanan, Joe McMoneagle, David Morehouse {Psychic Warriors) and Ed Dames. Gung-ho Dames is the main thread con- necting remote viewing and UFOs. Shortly before retiring from the Army, while living in Albuquerque, he and Morehead founded Psi-Tech with the idea of using moonlight- ing military psychics as remote viewers for various civilian clients. During his own tour Dames had become convinced that remote viewing could be applied to unconventional, as well as conventional, targets. Trouble was, confirmation was even harder to come by. In March, 1993, according to Schnabel, Dames told a local UFO conference that \"a colony of pregnant Martian females lay be- neath the New Mexico desert. Sometime be- tween April and August, he predicted, these Martians would give birth and emerge aboveground. 'We're sure it's going to hap- pen,' he told his audience. 'We've alerted the media, and teams of doctors, technicians, and documentary fillmakers are on call and in place to respond at a moment's notice...President Clinton will announce it and everyone in the world will know!'\" But August came and went without any pronouncement. Meanwhile, paying clients were scarce, perhaps not surprisingly so in light of the above public and spectacular failure of prediction based on Psi-Tech's sta- ble of remote viewers. To keep the company alive, Dames began offering training classes in remote viewing (a week long course went for almost $3000), passing along the tech- niques Swann had earlier developed and supposedly perfected. One of Psi-Tech's students was Courtney Brown, a professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta, who would go on to found his own remote viewing organi- zation, the Farsight Institute. Following Dames' lead, Brown turned his own stable of viewers loose on the UFO problem. The results, published as Cosmic Voyage, pur- portedly detailed the interactive history be- tween several types of aliens and the planet Earth — all divined from the comfort of the remote viewer's couch. Brown's psychic brouhaha was even more spectacular than Dames' prediction of preg- nant Martians, if for no other reason than that it took place in full public view on the Internet and the Art Bell Show. The occa- sion was a fake photograph purportedly showing a large object accompanying comet Hale-Bopp into the solar system. Remote viewing \"revealed\" that the \"object\" was \"occupied\" by aliens who meant us no harm and who would soon reveal themselves. The trouble with this scenario is that no such ob- ject existed — except in the more conspira- torial realms of cyberspace. But this extraordinary false \"hit\" high- lights the problems encountered by the gov- ernment's own psychic spy program, and ex- plains why it was eventually allowed to wither on the vine. (Declining cold war bud- gets would play a role, too.) Success was a highly individualized and subjective affair, and even the best psychics, Swann included, could never guarantee absolute accuracy. But information is only viable to the extent that it can be acted upon. Suppose, as hap- pened, that the Army psychics housed at Fort Meade, Maryland, informed their higher ups that a hostage was being held at a house in Palermo, Italy. Should the house be stormed by SWAT teams solely on the basis In March, 1993, Dames told a UFO conference that\"a colony of pregnant Martian fe- males lay be- neath the New Mexico desert.

FILER, USA? iflelj T his is the third Gulf Breeze book pro- duced by Ed Walters, the first two being co-authored with former wife Frances. Ed's collaborator this time around is Bruce Maccabee. who needs no introduction to readers of this Journal. Maccabee con- tributes a chapter on photoanalysis, which looks at some of Ed's pictures, old and new, and Part 3 in its entirety, entitled \"More Evidence From Gulf Breeze,\" which exam- ines more recent cases. The book consists of four parts and two appendices, the second of which, by Walters, briefly discusses such subjects as \"Nonhuman DNA,\" \"The Great Pyramid Coincidence\" (both Giza and Gulf Breeze apparently lie within a degree or two of latitude 30 degrees north), and \"Telepathy is Real.\" As will shock no one here. Gulf Breeze remains a source of great controversy. Ufologists seem divided into two distinct and diametrically opposed camps. Ed's ad- herents see the Florida town as a UFO hot spot, and (as does Maccabee, for example) argue that a case can be made for the town's strange UFO attraction even if Walters him- self is completely removed from the picture. Detractors point to the possibility (some would say the evidence) of a hoax, the prox- imity of military air traffic in the area, pos- sible balloon-launched flares, and the will to believe as mitigating factors. Will this book settle the sand, one way or the other? Not likely; the two sides are al- ready too entrenched for that. Too much wa- ter (and in some cases, friendships) are al- ready under the causeway. Judged as just another book, it stacks up as something of a hodge-podge, which can be viewed, I sup- pose, as either a strength or a weakness. Weakness-wise, it means that there's no overarching theory to account for all the disparate contents, no unity of voice (or necessarily even of view). There's no at- tempt to integrate Gulf Breeze into what is known about UFOs as a whole: what may well be discrete events gain context only in reference to Ed Walters. Gulf Breeze the town, or both. On the other hand, the hodge-podge fac- tor means that the whole work isn't entirely devoted to Gulf Breeze. Over the years, Walters has received thousands of letters and numerous photographs from around the world from readers of his first two books. Many of those are related or pictured here for the first time. Thus the 16-page b&w photo section contains pictures from Mexico, Brazil, Guatemala and other lo- cales, including the Fiji Islands. Sans nega- tives and analyses, most of these — which do indeed resemble the classic Gulf Breeze \"tea pot\" UFO — have to be taken at face value."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL John Carpenter ^i^-^i^^^^^^j^ An Examination of Aftereffects T here are often many assumptions about what people experience following their recognition and awareness of contact with otherworldly beings. Many people think that those persons must be traumatized by the hypnosis or investigative procedures that would promote such ideas. However, from my own experience with 120 cases, there appears to be immediate relief, en- hanced understanding, less confusion, a healthy but bewildering awareness, and cer- tainly a large degree of amazement. Despite recalling such extraordinary events and bizarre imagery, there is clearly a feeling of resolving a puzzle. What once seemed to be a confusing mystery with missing pieces is now a more complete picture — which brings some relief and processing of the new pieces which now fit and make sense to the abductee. People have claimed to have slept better than they have in months, comprehended previously misunderstood events in their lives, and experienced de- creased phobic responses to stimuli which now have a known origin. For example, people who had a phobic fear of \"falling up\" now understand where such a reaction could originate. Moving from a vague and confusing sense of global fear to a specific cause is usually quite a relief as it narrows the full range of fears to an identified source. And, although the subject content is so bizarre and outrageous, the subject still experiences this relief. Another myth is that \"everybody will need intensive therapy.\" Actually, since subjects of these encounters are usually psychologically healthy with little or no history of any problems, very little on-go- ing therapy has been necessary. Support groups have been effective for sharing feel- ings, re-establishing sanity, and returning a sense of normalcy. The most common ther- apeutic process is akin to a grieving process. Subjects are grieving their loss of their former reality — one in which aliens or UFOs did not exist! Now they are forced, kicking and screaming, into having to rethink their whole concept of reality, other forms of life, and a different view of the Universe. They might be angry that this happened to them without their permission or any explanation given. They may be- come depressed over finding themselves alone and disbelieved. They will undoubt- edly try to deny such ideas and promote mundane and more acceptable explanations — although privately they know differ- ently. They may try to bargain by stating that they will agree to believe in this phe- nomenon if they can have another en- counter — perhaps in a fully conscious state of mind. As with the other stages of grieving — Denial, Anger, Depression, and Bargaining — the final phase. Acceptance, can be a real turning point where new growth influenced by new perspectives can really flourish. Many exciting life changes occur with acceptance; many people change careers, mates, living environments, and their quality of living — including spir- ituality and environmental awareness. Although some believe that such changes are influenced directly by alien interven- tion, these transformations are most likely due to the growth stemming from their new view of life. A nother myth surrounds the notion that most abductees will write books and seek publicity once they have accepted the experience. Barely five percent of my 120 cases have tried to write a book, and hardly any of them really desire any publicity. Writing a book is a therapeutic form of coping, processing the information, and ed- ucating or helping others. Several subjects have been furious with the secrecy and dis- belief in what they consider to be a most serious topic. They write or speak about their experiences boldly to reduce igno- rance, enhance public awareness, and be an advocate for those who are afraid to speak out. The other 95% of abductees shy away from any public association with the sub- ject. Support groups may be the only outlet for those who need social support. Some find the subject fascinating and become in- vestigators. Others attend UFO conferences to privately learn more. Most cases take what they have gained from the investiga- tions and quietly return to their normal There are some fasci- nating pat- terns of other aftereffects which I am finding con- sistent worldwide.

It should be noted that therapists only receive those contact cases where people are reporting upsetting and troubling en- counters. There are many people out there who recognize and deal with this contact experience all on their own. Their, reac- tions, beliefs, and methods of coping are less known because they did not seek thera- pists or investigators. So information pro- vided by therapists like myself represents a skewed sample of data. There are some fascinating patterns of other aftereffects which I am finding consistent worldwide. Apparently just after abduction encounters, many people have been reporting electrical disturbances in their homes. Appliances will turn on and off by themselves — or continue to operate after being unplugged! Unusual shocks may occur when touching soil, wood, and other unlikely materials. Touching dish- washers, microwaves, lights, computers, small appliances, etc. may cause those items to short out. Several people lost their jobs because they could not be around com- puters any longer! The abductee himself seems \"charged\" and can produce amazing results when utilizing Kirlian photography. What sounds like simply another \"urban myth\" — causing streetlights to blow out — has some apparent validity. When asked such a question, many subjects have re- ported this occurrence — and with amaze- ment that it had happened to anybody else. There is also a common report of sensitiv- ity to magnets — being able to sense where they are located and perhaps being unable to stay near them. Quite a great number of cases demon- strate enhanced psychic ability and possibly psychokinesis in the home. Although not desired or really appreciated, these persons find themselves knowing things well be- yond chance and often observing objects move or fly across the room. One girl told me she never thought it was strange to dodge flying books or clothes until she found it did not happen in the homes of her friends! Due to the consistent data in re- search suggesting that these beings use strong telepathic powers, it is quite possible that they have \"trained\" or \"exercised\" the powers of those abductees to the point over a lifetime that they find themselves with these abilities on an everyday basis. This does not say that they know how to use such an ability effectively — and may ex- plain the random psychokinetic occurrences in the home! Many cases report feeling that they were \"up all night in a classroom-like setting be- ing taught information or trained in some skills.\" Exhausted when they awaken, not one case can recall what it is that they were being taught — but all receive the distinct impression that they will be allowed to know at a later point in time. If these were dreams or delusions, then we would get many detailed reports of teachings. But it is highly consistent among credible cases that nobody can remember their \"teachings.\" John Carpenter can be contacted by email at starmanJC@aol.com.

I am the author of two books, a mono- graph, and several articles about the \"ab- duction phenomenon.\" Dr. Helmut Lammer's \"Project MILAB\" was originally published on my web site at http://www.alienjigsaw.corn. I am also one of the abductees that Dr. Lammer refer- enced in his article when Project MILAB was published in the MUFON UFO Journal in December 1996. Since Mrs. Alexander is accusing ab- ductees she knows absolutely nothing about of experiencing sexual fantasies, I believe some background information about my- self, as an \"abductee,\" is in order. In 1988, as part of a personal investiga- tion of my encounter experiences, I went to a clinical and forensic psychologist in Pensacola, Florida, named Dan C. Overlade, Ph.D. Over a period of about three weeks, Dr. Overlade administered the following psychological tests to me: The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory; The Rorschach Ink-blot Test; The Thematic Apperception Test; The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; and The Draw-A-Person Test. After the test results were obtained. Dr. Overlade explained that the tests showed I was a psychologically stable individual with an above average IQ, and that I was not \"fantasy prone.\" He told me I had no abnormalities beyond some anxieties, more specifically what he called symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, and low self-esteem. For those of you who may not have known him, Dr. Overlade practiced clinical and forensic psychology for over thirty-five years before his death in 1990. He earned his Ph.D. from Purdue University and held appointments as adjunct professor of psy- chology with the University of Florida and the University of West Florida. He was a past president of the Florida Psychological Association, the Florida State Board of Examiners of Psychology, and the Forensic Psychologists, Inc. He also held diplomas in clinical psychology and forensic psy- chology of the American Board of Professional Psychology, and the diploma in clinical hypnosis of the American Board of Psychological Hypnosis. In her letter to the Journal. Mrs. Alexander asks, \"When will someone sepa- rate the sexually-repressed fantasies of lonely women from the abduction genre and sort out what belongs in the MUFON UFO Journal!\" Dr. Lammer referenced alleged military intelligence related abductions of several abductees in his article, including Casey Turner, the husband of the late Dr. Karla Turner. I doubt anyone would accuse Mr. Turner of being a \"sexually repressed [and] lonely woman\" as Mrs. Alexander alludes to in her over-generalizing question. However, Casey Turner also had an experi- ence similar to those reported by Dr. Karla Turner, Leah Haley, Debbie Jordan, myself and others. I wonder how we can explain Casey Turner's experience? Perhaps Mrs. Alexander has a special category for men who believe they have been abducted by members of the military. I would also like to inform Mrs. Alexander that 1 have been happily married to my husband for ten years. If she has any suspicions that I am a \"lonely woman\" who is experiencing \"sexually repressed fan- tasies,\" I encourage her to contact my hus- band herself by writing to Erik at ewil- son@alienjigsaw.com. He would be happy to set the record straight and tell Mrs. Alexander how incorrect her out-dated Freudian hypothesis is as it relates to me. Mrs. Alexander is incorrect again when she accuses us of being \"acronym pos- sessed.\" (referring to the title of Dr. Lammer's article. Project MILAB). I'm just guessing, but perhaps it is she who is \"acronym possessed.\" After all, she's the one married to a retired colonel of the mili- tary!

More science please — less polemic. —Helmut Lammer, Ph.D. Rumor vs. Fact \"Where else but in the UFO field,\" Robert Todd asks in his letter in the Journal's March issue, \"would a rumor be taken as a fact?\" The answer is simple: everywhere. Every human being everywhere, including Mr. Todd, believes something to be true that is based on unsubstantiated informa- tion. In short, ufologists behave like what they are: human beings. Even scientists, al- legedly the most disinterested of truth-seek- ers, have been known to promulgate rumors on the mistaken belief they are facts. A par- ticularly notorious example involved the prominent physicist John A. Wheeler who — speaking to no less than the American Association for the Advancement of Science — charged that parapsychologist J. B. Rhine had committed fraud early in his career. The accusation was based on rumor, not on fact, and Wheeler was forced to pub- lish a retraction (Science, July 13, 1979). It never ceases to amaze me how much some ufologists like to vilify their col- leagues, and to treat ufology as if it were some uniquely venal pursuit. For all its faults, ufology has a healthy tradition of de- bate, criticism, and self-correction. It hardly merits the sort of demonization (or self-loathing?) which has become trendy in some circles. While Todd rightly disputes assertions that Condon urged destruction of the Blue Book files, we ought not to get misty-eyed about Condon's role in any of this. He did everything in his considerable power till his death in 1974 to discourage further scien- tific or scholarly inquiry into the UFO phe- nomenon. His views were so extreme that they brought him into conflict with other skeptical scientists, including Carl Sagan. In the wake of Blue Book's closing in 1969, there was concern (unmentioned by Todd) that the files would be destroyed. Twelve of the 16 participants in the AAAS UFO Symposium (December 26-27, 1969), which Condon had bitterly opposed even though it was heavily slanted toward skep- tics, signed a letter, addressed to Air Force Secretary Robert C. Seamans, Jr., urging the Air Force to preserve the records. On January 9, 1970, Donald H. Menzel wrote symposium organizer Thornton Page to say that while he favored storage of the files, Blue Book documents should be im- pounded for another decade and then kept forever out of the hands of pro-UFO scien- tists such as J. Allen Hynek and James E. McDonald and of ufologists. —Jerome Clark Canby, Minnesota John Ford Redux \"Harry Hepcat,\" in the January Journal, publishes a long diatribe of spleen and in- vective against imprisoned NY UFO re- searcher John Ford, and against me for writing in defense of John. At the end, Hepcat says he hopes John Ford is gang raped by prisoners while in jail. It was a rather frightening outpouring, and left me bowled over that Mr. Hepcat (if that is his real name) had so much personal energy to denounce another man."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Half of Harry's letter boils down to com- plaints that John Ford threw him out of the Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON) or- ganization. Given Harry's personality, how much of a surprise is that? Harry also says John Ford was fired from his job in the Suffolk County NY court system, and that John Ford \"tried to run down with his truck\" one Viriginia Stevens, whom Hepcat says worked in the same court building with John. According to Steve lavarone, vice presi- dent of LIUFON, John retired from his job on disability. \"I've seen the papers,\" lavarone says. On the other allegation, I quote John Marafino, court officer and John's co- worker in the Suffolk court system; he never heard of Virginia Stevens. \"If she worked in any of the Suffolk court build- ings John worked in, and there was an inci- dent,\" Marafino says, \"I would have heard of it.\" Maybe Harry was jealous because no- body wrote an article about him. But what gets me is that all of Harry's charges, added up, do not justify what he says he hopes happens to John Ford. Therefore, I can't rely on Mr. Hepcat's accuracy and truthful- ness, because I question his moral and psy- chological balance. —Elaine Douglass MUFON St. Dir. Washington, D.C. DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE - Continued from Page 23 edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is eligible to take the exam via mail when they feel qualified. The 100-question test may be secured from MUFON head- quarters in Seguin and returned to Kathleen F. Marden, 103 Willow Road, East Kingston, NH 03827, for grading. In locali- ties where field investigator training classes are conducted, the instructor may order suf- ficient quantities of the test and administer the exam at the conclusion of the training classes.

Webb May 1997 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) reappears in the evening sky by mid-May, glimmering low in the WNW. It sets about an hour after the Sun. Mars, near the Leo-Virgo border, continues to fade during the month, from magnitude -0.5 to +0.2. Our ruddy planet neighbor lies in the S at dusk, advancing westward during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars sets in the W about 3 AM in midmonth. Jupiter (-2.4), in Capricornus. rises in the E about 1:30 AM in mid-May and shines brightly in the SE at dawn. The big world lies 4° S of the quarter Moon on the 28th. Saturn (0.8). in Pisces, rises in the E about 4:30 AM in mid- month. Use the nearby crescent Moon on May 4 to find the planet below in the twilight. Comet Hale-Bopp: The comet descends rapidly in the WNW. It begins the month about 10\" up toward the end of dusk but disappears into the twilight by mid-May. Least moonlight is from about May 1 to 9. Moon Phases: ^^ New moon—May 6 ^^ O First quarter—May 14 Full moon—May 22 Last quarter—May 29 The Stars: Now in a fine viewing position, the Big Dipper is a handy guidepost to many spring constellations. After twilight ends, this celestial ladle of 7 stars can be found upside- down and almost overhead. A line through the 2 stars on the end of the bowl points downward to a spot near Polaris the North Star, the end of the Little Dipper's handle. The stellar pair on the other side of the Big Dipper's bowl points in the opposite direction to Regulus. the heart of Leo the Lion. The dipper's arching handle traces a curve southward to the bright orange star Arcturus in Bootes the Herdsman. And if extended even farther S. the curved line reaches blue-white Spica in Virgo the Maiden.

Fran Geremia, wife of New Hampshire State Director, Pete Geremia, was the 1996 winner. The cover design should reflect the symposium theme \"The Fiftieth Anniversary of Ufology\" and include, in addition to the theme, the statements \"MUFON 1997 INTERNATIONAL UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS,\" the location GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN, and the symposium dates \"July 11-13.\" The contest submissions must be \"camera ready\" and not simply attractive designs, symbols or artwork. The contest prize winner will re- ceive $100 in cash plus $100 in MUFON publications merchandise. Please submit entries to Walt Andrus, the symposium proceedings editor. Only five entries have been received. I am confident that there are other artists that could produce an intriguing cover or com- puter artists that are capable of utilizing their comput- ers to depict their ideas. The deadline for cover de- signs has been extended to May 15, 1997. MOTTO CONTEST We are searching for a motto that best exemplifies MUFON's goals and objectives, that is serious, in- triguing, eye-catching, and meaningful. This contest produced more responses than any other project that MUFON has proposed in 27 years. Five-hundred and ninety-four mottos were submitted from 76 different people. Nine judges are endeavoring to select what they consider the 25 best, in their judgment, that meets our objectives. The deadline was March 15th for the judges. I can envision a run-off vote of the mottos that rank at the top after we receive the judges' choices, therefore an announcement date for the con- test winner is still pending. It is imperative that we se- lect a motto that we can live with for the next 25 years, therefore rushing the judges is not a wise deci- sion. ASSOCIATE MEMBERS AUXILIARY The entry on the back of MUFON's \"Application for Membership\" defines a Field Investigator Trainee: The person engages in an open-ended period of educa- tion in the UFO subject under the guidance of experi- enced individuals in order to become familiar with all aspects of case investigation. The trainee is expected to obtain and utilize the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual and, whenever possible, assist in conducting investigations of UFO events reported by the public. The definition of an Associate Member: The same qualifications as a Field Investigator Trainee except that the member is under the age of 18 years. We are cognizant that the teenagers of today will be the future scientists and ufologists 1 of tomorrow, there- fore they are significant members of MUFON and should be more involved in our research activities. I have personally felt for a long time that we have not ' been utilizing the talent and unbridled enthusiasm of our associate members. Now is the time to remedy this situation, since we have some brilliant teenage members who are anxious to become more involved. A fourteen-year old high school student Thomas J. Lyon, P. O. Box 310, Warsaw, New York 14569-0310, has volunteered to spearhead in what I have tenta- tively named the \"Associate Members Auxiliary.\" Tom joined MUFON on February 8, 1996, and a year later started formulating a plan which he refers to as an \"involvement drive.\" He has already enlisted the aid of Lynda D. Poss, another 14- year old student living in Wyoming, New York, who joined MUFON on 2/6/97 and shares Tom's enthusiasm. Tom's tele- phone number is (716) 786-0625. In order to kickoff the program, your Director sup- plied Tom with our computer list of every Associate Member worldwide. This will become his mailing list to send letters to associates seeking their ideas and how they could get more involved. He said one of his main goals of the project is to boost membership in MUFON. Young people are quite capable of perform- ing in the MUFON classifications of Amateur Radio Operator and UFO Newsclipping Service in addition to Associate Member. Tom and Lynda feel that the MUFON logo T-shirts and ball caps, would appeal to young folks, presently stocked in our UFO Information Center. This is an appeal to other Associate Members that are anxious to help in this project to contact Tom Lyon at the above address and volunteer your assistance. We are also looking for adult volunteers who will act as consultants and advisors to help the new Associate Members Auxiliary in this very important venture. These people should write and offer their services to Walt Andrus so an advisory committee may be formed. Tom has been very active in the Boy Scouts of America and high school extracurricular activities. His SAT scores indicate that he is a bright young man. At grade 6 his test grade equivalent was llth grade and his grade 7 was that of first year of college. Tom likes the name Associate Members Auxiliary for this group. He will organize the auxiliary by states in the same format as MUFON, that is, State and State Section Directors.
