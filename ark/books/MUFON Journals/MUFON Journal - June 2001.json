By Freddy Silva Extracts from Secrets in the Fields Images (c) Freddy Silva, Hans Wiedmer, Lucy Pringle, Colin Andrews. During the twilight days of Decem- ber 1998, small articles tucked away in the nether regions of the British press quietly announced \"Unknown Force Was Behind Corn Circles, Claims Hoaxer.\" This dramatic U-turn by the sur- viving member of the infamous Doug & Dave duo-who since 1991 have misled the world with tales of their crop flattening prowess with planks of wood- illustrates that the hand of man materialized in crop circle lore long after the real phenomenon manifested. Modern hoaxers claim that they applied boot to wheat in 1978, yet crop circles have appeared sporadically throughout the world since the early 1900s, with dozens of eyewitnesses reporting crop circles forming in a mat- ter of seconds as far back as 1890; several descriptive accounts were even documented in 1678 by Robert Plot, then curator of the Ashmolean. If hoaxers are responsible, they also appear to have mastered the art of time travel, in which case it is they who should be under scientific scrutinity. One rfHawkins' cir&a '^•swg'pn^ Jbeiy ccnlain didonic (Trims:: -.-. \" * •.*.*\" . ~ v- .••\" /* • r •'. *. .\"\" To date over 9000 crop circles have been catalogued worldwide, and their anomalous features continue to be irreplecatable: plants bent an inch above soil and gently laid down in geometrically-precise patterns with no physi- cal signs of damage, altered cellular structure and soil chemistry, discrepancies in background radiation, alteration of the local electromagnetic field, massive depletion of the watershed, and dowsable, long-lasting energy patterns, not to mention measured effects on the human biological field. So much, then, for two guys and a piece of wood. But thanks to a virtual embargo on research coverage through- out the media, a popular myth has developed that all crop circles have been nothing more than a prank with a plank. Originals required By definition, hoaxes are forgeries, and forgeries re- quire originals from which to copy. But what is this \"un- known force\" behind the creation of genuine crop circles? Echoed in all the world's faiths and traditions, Universal matter was created by sound: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,\" St. John reminds us. When our ancestors chose to symbolize the action of physi- cal Creation they chose to do so with geometry: the circle as a representation of God, followed by the two overlap- ping circles as the act of separation between thought and matter. It is from the womb of this symbol-the vesica piscis- that all geometric forms common to sacred geom- etry are born. Modern science has shown that these geometric rhythms lie at the centre of atomic structures. When Andrew Gladzewski carried out research into atomic patterns, plants, crystals, and harmonics in music he concluded that atoms are harmonic resonators, proving that physical reality is actually governed by patterned arrays of sound frequen- cies. Even that primeval Hindu sound, the OM, from which"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 June 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Formations at Fraxfietdjil aft-)-artd Harwell {micWe};-ltiese'l:findu rnandalBs t :tjBSio tp.:aacred geometry,;, arewave patterns'of scsirid freqiiencywru chare at sb-fwi^iniih^imdBdiiar'Btrucitureiaif: \"\" '. is derived our modem term \"hum,\" when sung into a tono- scope produces the very geometric shapes attributed with \"sacredness.\" Perhaps the most important of these shapes is the hexagon, upon which the Egyptian matrix named the Flower of Life is based. This series of outwardly- rotating divisions of the circle accommodate the branches of the building blocks of life, the amino acids. It has sub- sequently manifested as a crop circle. As the expression of number in space, geometry is inextricably linked to music, since the laws of the former govern the mathematical intervals that make up the notes in the western music scale-the diatonic ratios-hence why the ancient Egyptians referred to geometry as frozen music. Theorems and crop circles In the February 1992 edition of Science News, Prof. Gerald Hawkins used the principles of Euclidean geom- etry to prove that four theorems can be derived from the relationships of elements in crop circles. More significantly, he discovered a fifth theorem from which he could derive the other four. Despite an open challenge, over half a million subscrib- ers have been unable to create such a theorem, which Euclid himself only hinted at twenty-three centuries earlier in his thirteen trea- tises on mathematics. So it came as a slight surprise when its equilateral version materialized as 160,000 sq. ft. of flattened barley at Litchfield, Hants., in 1995. Since Hawkins' Euclid- ean theorems also produce diatonic ratios, a link exists between crop circles and musical notes, themselves the by-product of the har- monic laws of sound fre- quency. Soon, crop circles bearing unmistakable associa- tions with sound began to appear. One contained a curi- ous ratchet feature from which is constructed a musical diagram also dating to the Egyptians, the Lambdoma. Also known as the Pythagorean Table, it defines the exact re- lationships between musical harmonics and mathematical ratios. In 1996 another crop circle demonstrated the combi- nation of two important figures: the 3-4-5 triangle and the Golden Mean, producing the geometric diagram neces- sary to produce musical ratios. But it was a convincing formation at Goodwood Qatford-which had its plants bent six inches from the top-that gave the proverbial nod to sound, for here was a representation of a cymatic pattern etched in 5,000 sq ft of barley. Cymatics is the study of vibrational wave patterns. One of its earliest pupils was Margaret Watts-Hughes, who in 1891 captured precise geometric patterns on film as she sang sustained notes into a device containing lycopodium powder. But it would be another seventy-six years before Swiss scientist Hans Jenny published the first of his pains- taking studies on the transmission of sound through physi- cal mediums, this time in the shape of monitored elec- A tarvcled;Wrmoii(» tf ft r^"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2001 PageS tronic frequencies. He observed how sound vibration created geometric shapes-a low frequency produced a simple circle encompassed by rings, whereas a higher frequency increased the num- ber of concentric rings around a central circle. As the frequencies rose so, too, did the complexity of shapes, to the point where tetrahe- drons, mandalas and other sacred forms could be discerned. Like Margaret before him, Jenny enabled humanity to observe frozen music. Jenny also provided a physical connection to the creation of crop circles, since many of the vibrational patterns found in his photos mimic their designs. Some are blatant imitations, such as the circle surrounded by concen- tric rings typical of early 80s pat- terns, the tetrahedron at Barbury Castle in 1991, the spider's web mandala at Avebury from 1994, even the highly structured star fractals of 1997. Other photos demonstrate the construction geometry encoded within the crop circles' skeleton. Visually, then, there is little room to deny the connec- tion. But what evidence is there of sound in crop circles at a physical level? In his extensive database, leading crop circles re- searcher Colin Andrews notes several accounts of a trilling sound heard by people prior to witnessing crop circles forming. The reports describe a sudden stillness in the air, the morning birdsong superceeded by a trilling sound and the banging together of wheat heads despite an absence of wind. A whole section of crop then lays down in spiral fashion, the whole epi- sode lasting less than fifteen seconds. Andrews came across the trilling noise himself when, in mild frustration during his search to find a single answer to the phenomenon, he be- seeched the heavens, \"God, if only you could tell me how these things are created.\" The reply he received was eventually captured on mag- netic tape. Subsequent analy- sis at Sussex University and Stockbrlclge. formation. (topVand Pythagoras'lanibdomai, which r<Hi«- NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab concluded the noise was mechanical in nature and beating at a frequency of 5.0-5.2kHz. Whilst recording an interview inside a crop circle the same sound was heard by a BBC cameraman shortly before it rendered a £30,000 TV camera ob- solete. Interestingly, when the sound made another appearance during group research inside another formation it exhibited qualities of non-linear move- ment, and behaved in tandem with spe- cific requests, sometimes on a psychic level. Since it also has the ability to trans- mit on radio frequencies and interfere with electronic equipment, birds and in- sects can be ruled out; and although skeptics are quick to claim that the re- corded sound is, in fact, the grasshop- per warbler, stroboscopic analysis of both voice prints revealed vast differ- ences between this bird and the bizarre noise. Besides, these birds frequent marshes, not vast, open fields of ce- real crop. Interestingly, the Aborigines relate to this trilling sound. During their cer- emonies to contact-in their words-the sky spirits, a bora consisting of a specially-shaped piece of wood is attached to the end of a long string and whirled, creating a noise practically identical to the crop circle hum. One has to wonder where the inspiration for this device came from, who these sky spirits were, and what on earth made the timeless Aborigines associate this noise with them. That was until it was discovered that not only have crop circles appeared in Australia, many throughout the 1960s, but their manifestation figures in Aboriginal lore, just as The famMH.&artiuiy O^J.drtA(«lribiiBniii ^;M*rt«, r ^rt'BMI KnrnnK ficfimicy m water"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 June 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Kexagonal-'ajeomBtry craatad by.sosmd^as se ..:••.•>?.-••••\";;.••. •..•;'^:->.\"...V.,'>.^ •-• • •.'.•.:•.*. •.••\".•••.••'•-. \\.-.'>,A' » a role- ara l-abDratory/ j, '* V\" '' : sr'*i'V ..I/, !• ' , V\" ~ \"C^'-T'v their geometries appear in rock paintings. In 1998 sounds of a more melodic kind were heard and recorded inside a formation by three witnesses (or is it earwitnesses?): the design was founded on sevenfold ge- ometry, a representation of the intervals in the diatonic music scale. Several months later I came across a dia- gram called the Web of Athena, in which all the points of the heptagon are connected. Despite the jumble of lines the diagram consists of just three line lengths, and by jux- taposing these onto a stringed instrument, the exact same notes were recreated. But perhaps the greatest connection linking sound to the manifestation of crop circles lies in their greatest anomaly: the permanent bending of the plants' stems. In Canada during the 1960s, laboratory experiments mea- sured the effects of music on plants by subjecting them to different strains of tones. Exposure to heavy metal music made the plants tilt in the opposite direction, whereas classical music lulled the plants toward the speakers. But in the case of Hindu de- votional music-and the songs of Ravi Shankar, in particu- lar-the stems bent in excess of 60° to the horizontal, per- haps the closest any human has ever come anywhere to achieving that right angle common to genuine crop circles. Stomata, epidermal walls, cells affected Further experiments at Annamalai University applying Indian devotional song generated additional effects: the number of stomata in the experimental plants was 66% higher, the epidermal walls were thicker, and the palisade cells were longer and broader than control specimens, sometimes by as much as 50%. Biophysical changes are known to occur in plants col- lected from crop circles. Tests performed since 1989 by American physicist Dr. W. Levengood consistently show how the energy creating crop circles is able to affect seed embryo and plant growth, elongate the plant's nodes, even alter the pattern of the chromosomes themselves. But the effect extends beyond plants. Agricultural re- searcher George Smith found that exposing corn to sound frequencies produced a higher heat content in soil, as well as a slight burnt appearance in the plants. The effect is consistent with the slight \"baking\" regu- larly observed in crop circles, where the affected area ap- pears noticeably drier than the rest of the field despite over- night rain; the same applies to the \"slight burning\" at the base of affected stalks. Oddly enough, Smith speculated at the time that sound energy also increased molecular activity in plants, three decades be- fore it was found in crop circle samples by Levengood. Since a sudden and abnormal burst of growth is also known to occur in affected plants, it was postulated that microwave was the culprit behind the creation of crop circles; microwave has the ability to render biological sys- tems sterile, and a certain dose will even kill organisms. But the crop circles plants are alive and well. After four years of experiments on regular wheat at the University of Ottawa, Mary Measures and Pearl Weinberger found accelerated growth in laboratory samples, and postulated that the sound frequency they applied had produced a resonant effect in the plants' cells, thereby affecting their metabolism. The frequency Mea- sures and Weinberger applied was identical to the crop circle trilling noise. Sound as one energy source capable of creating crop circles now becomes very feasible. But what type of sound coaxes plants to bend and lie down, applying firm and gentle pressure and, given the intricacy and complexity of latterday patterns, with a fine degree of control? Interestingly, ultrasound is capable of interacting with physical elements to an incredible degree. It can be aimed, focused and reflected almost like a light beam, and spe- cific frequencies can be focused to cause certain kinds of molecules to vibrate while others nearby are left unmoved; in laboratory experiments, a flame has been extinguished by the application of such frequencies. The higher the frequency of ultrasound, the greater its ability to be directed. This requires frequencies in the high MHz range, such as those detected in crop circles by Paul Vigay, who has undertaken experiments to also gauge dis- crepancies in electromagnetic frequency. Crossing the threshold Paul's empirical data shows how the level of back- ground readings drop abruptly when he crosses the thresh- old of a formation. Close to the centre, readings hover in the vicinity of 260-320 MHz. But just as crop circles have"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2001 Page? .. .Hacipari B-i IJ -crcp; : ci rdi e ; i svlbaseti!

Incredibly, this coincides with Jenny's experiments which show that a relationship exists between the rising com- plexity of cymatic geometries in proportion to the rise of dispensed frequency. In other words, the level of fre- quency, whether in a laboratory or a field, correlates with the increase in design intricacy. These extremely high frequencies ally with the mind- field and have been shown to affect the state of aware- ness and consciousness in humans. Reports of such have been compiled from hundreds of people visiting forma- tions, where even simple left brain functions such as count- ing are affected. When tuned in the MHz range, ultrasound prevents damage to sensitive tissues, so its healing properties are used in treating muscular ailments; these conditions are also synonymous with crop circle reports, the effects be- ing relative to the age of each formation and duration of stay for the individual involved. Below 30Hz sound becomes infrasonic, and such fre- quencies are directly involved with biological processes. When combined with high-pressure, permanent changes are produced in receiving materials, since the acoustic power created by infrasound is in the order of kilowatts (hence why long exposure in certain crop circles causes unpleasant conditions such as fatigue and nausea). Heat created In water, this creates heat which tears apart the mol- ecules to form vapor; in the case of plants, whose stems are filled with water, the vaporization creates a void which collapses the area instantaneously as the energy is re- leased. This action, called vapor cavitation, also creates local temperature increases of hundreds of thousands of degrees for a fraction of a second. Now, cut the base stem of a crop circle plant and you will notice a cooked odor. Combine this with millions of gallons of missing groundwater, as well as Levengood's discovery of microscopic blow-holes in the plants' cell wall pits (indicating a rapid boiling of water inside the plant), and everything starts to fall into place. This process also creates a hissing sound, and if you are fortunate enough to visit a crop circle within a few hours of its appearance you will find yourself surrounded by this until you leave. Since infrasound is capable of at- omizing water molecules and creating a fine mist, it should be mentioned that in 1996 a farmer out harvesting his field at Etchilhampton saw what he describes as \"a series of columns of mist rising like cannonshot from the field next door.\" Mist looks very out-of-place in a wheat field, in mid- afternoon on a dry, summer's day. Yet shortly after the incident a series of thirteen circles connected by a three quarter-mile long avenue and a Sanskrit glyph appeared in the very same field. Finally, cavitation is accompanied by a sudden spark of light called sonoluminescence, caused by the production of electrical discharges as the water/vapor is ionized. And the lower the operating frequency, the greater the effect. In a laboratory, 18 Hz has been used as the lowest safety threshold below which the pressure formed by infrasound is known to produce disruption to chromosomes. Every summer, crop circle plants of every variety are sent blind to Dr. Levengood, and some inevitably show unmistakable disruption to their chromosomes. Yet give him samples deliberately produced by field forgers and he' 11 find something really unusual-perfectly normal plants. The musical scale, constructed on the harmonics of sacred geometry, and now found within the framework of crop circles, represents the mathematical structure of the soul of the world because it embodies the essence of the Universe. So it's no coincidence that a large percent- age of crop circles can be identified with-and by-ancient cultures, who to this day honor their histories through song a crop tkla.in barley"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS June 2001 MUFON UFO Journal and music, their healing rituals performed with sound or rhythm. This relationship is further extended in Buddhist mandalas, whose elaborate geometries are claimed to be the physicalization of chants which are used to alter states of consciousness. Perhaps it is not by coincidence that crop circle designs mirror these inticate patterns, just as they bear an uncanny familiarity to Jenny's materializa- tions of sound. If sound vibrations are both encoded into and gener- ated by crop circles, is it not possible that they, too, can arouse the individual at a spiritual level? After all, it's through music that whole human experiences are cel- ebrated and carried from generation to generation. It is very probable that it is for this reason that the very shape of the human ear-more specifically the cochlea-is a spiral constructed according to the harmonic laws of tone, just as the same spiral forms the primary basis from which thousands of crop circles have sprung. Music is a carrier for social change. The effects of Handel's music is believed to have reversed the state of morality in Victorian England, just as the anarchic over- tones of Punk corralled disillusioned youth into fighting an establishment that held no tolerance for those who stepped outside the system. The effects in people's states of aware- ness through contact with crop circles is similarly docu- mented. In 1990 a pictogram at Alton Barnes, sporting the tri- dent of Shiva the Transformer-also the Greek letter psi, the root of psyche, a collection of wave forms or vibra- tions-transformed a mass segment of society overnight, just as images of crop circles continue to enlighten the consciousness of those who come into contact with them. As Monteverdi once remarked, \"the end of all good music is to affect the soul.\" If sound is one of the forma- tive principles behind crop circles it is not surprising that they are leaving psychological impressions on those whose antenna is extended and receptive to their tune.

Box 369, Morrison, CO 80465-0369 Michigan sightings indicate animal, physiological effects By Judy Kulka, MUFON Field Investigator Shortly after 7p.m. EST on Nov. 16,1999, at least 11 individuals in Michigan's Antrim and Grand Traverse counties witnessed unexplained sightings of an aerial ob- ject. The first witness to come to my attention was a woman from Kewadin, MI, who had called the UFO Reporting Center, in Seattle, WA. Pe- ter Davenport, Director of the UFO Reporting Center, played an audio \"clip\" of her verbal report in the early morning hours of Nov. 17, 1999 on Art Bell's Coast to Coast radio program. Fortunately, my husband was listening to-and taping- the program at approxi- mately 2a.m. He awoke me with the startling \"news.\" I Judy Kulka requested that he save the tape and I would listen to it in the morning. In the tape the voice of the witness reported a very large lighted object hovering over treetops at shortly after 7 p.m. EST on Nov. 16,1999. The description of what she and the others in her car had seen lasted about two minutes. She stated she had gotten out of the car when they saw the \"humongous\" object hovering in front of them. She reported a green light (a lot of green) with some white behind it. It appeared to be larger than two football fields, and larger than her clenched fist at arm's length. She said it floated slowly over the treetops, glided, was perfectly round, made no noise, tilted to the side, nose- dived, then disappeared. She said she didn't believe in UFOs. I sent an e-mail to Davenport, telling him I was a MUFON Field Investigator in the Kewadin, MI, area, and if he could send me the name and phone number of the witness I would attempt to follow up on her report. A day or so later I received an e-mail back from Peter with the name and phone number of the witness. I phoned the witness, CC, and after I explained who I was and why I was calling, she agreed to an interview. The first witness CC explained she was driving east on Nichols Road toward US 31. (Nichols Road is a short road in Antrim County, less than a mile in length that runs from near Grand Traverse Bay, Lake Michigan, to US 31). As they"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2001 Page 9 drove east, they could see odd-looking lights over the trees ahead of them and slightly to the right. There were six persons in the car: the witness CC, a woman in her early thirties; her sister DB, also in her early thirties; their mother HM, age 57; the sister's two children, BB age 10 and his 5-year-old sister; and CC's infant daughter. The area where the sighting took place is rural and rural residential. The land has low hills, farm fields, low brush, and trees. A large landscape nursery is located just southeast of the intersection of Nichols Road and US 31. Christinas lights? The mother, HM, saw the lights first. In fact, she told me during her interview that she at first thought the land- scape nursery had put up \"some kind of fool Christmas lights.\" But as the group continued traveling east, she realized the lights were hovering over the trees. As they got to the stop sign at US 31 (sighting location #1 on map), they could definitely tell the object was over the buildings immediately southeast of them, above the landscape nursery, and just above treetop level. The two sisters, CC and DB, decided to get out of the car to have a better look. It was a very dark evening. The sun had set at about 5:30 p.m. CC recalled she put the car in \"park.\" She said there was no sound from the object. The closest part of the object appeared to be about 65 feet from them, and just 10 to 15 feet above the trees, in front of the Little Dipper. They saw no moon and no clouds. It appeared to be huge, like the size of a football field. She saw \"a string of about twelve lights\" evenly spaced and very bright, some green and the rest white. The green lights were the color of the green lights of a stop- light, and were \"5-10 feet apart.\" The white lights were very clear, like a spotlight, and it hurt her eyes to look at them. The lights were moving north (to their left) very slowly and appeared to glide. CC estimated they watched the object for 3-4 minutes. As they watched, it appeared to tip toward them, at which point they \"freaked\" and jumped back into the car. CC said at the point it \"tipped\" and they were jumping into the car, her mother, HM, saw lights \"clear around on the other side.\" CC could see the top of the object, which she described it as being round like a plate. It then straight- ened out, glided east, \"sort of leaped,\" and disappeared. At first in their excitement they thought it might be a huge plane ready to crash. They decided to drive the back roads in the area to see if they could see it again or whether it had crashed. They did not see it again, or evidence of anything that had crashed. More witnesses CC gave me the names and telephone number of her sister DB and her mother HM and thought they probably would also be willing to give me a report about their sight- . • -yEASTPMT.

She described the event almost exactly as her daughter had, al- though she said it didn't scare her. She also related that some years earlier (in approximately 1983) there was a strange incident at her house in which a terrible humming sound was heard outside at 3 a.m. A high-pitched sound also was heard, and the house became unbearably hot. The dog became very agitated, so they let it outdoors. The dog ran out, then froze, and would not move. Neither HM nor her ex-husband had the courage to go out and investigate. She said she vowed at that time if anything \"weird\" ever happened to her again she was not going to be afraid and she was going to face it. HM also said that many years ago (in approximately 1955) her brother, who was 16 or 17, saw a large UFO by an Elk Lake farm (also in this general area), was terri- fied, and to this day is still terrified of the thought of UFOs. HM has a sister in Manton (approximately 30 miles away) who saw a very bright object in the sky at about 6:45 p.m. the same evening as the current sighting, 11/16/ 99. She said, however, her sister did not want to talk to anyone about it (including any UFO investigator). HM described the object of the current sighting as at first looking like an airplane shape, but with no wings or tail. She said it had green lights and white lights and didn't seem to move at first, and was larger than her fist at arm's length. They could not see an outline. Eight days later I had a chance to interview DB, (CC's sister) by phone. Her story very closely matched those of her mother and sister, except she could see square windows between the round lights. She explained she was sitting in the back seat behind the driver, and that she got out of the car when her sister did to try to see the object more clearly. She also said there was no sound from the object. She thought she saw about 12-15 lights, with \"windows\" be- tween the lights. To her, it appeared to be the size of a 747. (This witness is a trained EMT.) The 10-year-old and the 5-year-old in the car were her children. When I requested her and her children draw a picture of what they saw, she said her and her son (the 10-year-old) al- ready had. Sketches obtained I was not able to arrange a face-to-face interview with any of these witnesses for one to three weeks because of their schedules and mine. I obtained sketches from CC and DB, and BB, the 10 year-old boy. The 5-year-old girl was shy and wouldn't talk to me about what she saw. MUFON's table at the 13th Annual Ozark UFO Conference in Eureka Springs, AR, was \"manned\" by Carolyn Connelly, right. Seated at the far left is author Timothy Good, one of the presenters. Lou Parish is director of the popular conference. BB very readily related his sighting, which was similar to CC's, his aunt. The sketches of the object drawn by mother and son were very similar, although drawn inde- pendently, except DB's showed square windows between the lights; BB's did not. A second sighting at approximately the same time that evening came to my attention in an article in the Traverse City Record Eagle newspaper dated Nov. 18,1999. The article was entitled, \"Look up in the sky-A meteor? An aircraft? A UFO?\" I decided to try to reach the wit- nesses of the sighting whose names were in the article. Fortunately, I found a telephone directory listing for them. Willing to talk GW was very willing to talk with me about the sighting by both her and her mother, and we set up an appoint- ment for a face-to-face interview. The scheduled appoint- ment was six days after the sighting. The witnesses reside at a farmhouse (sighting location #2 on the map) about four miles south of the above-de- scribed sighting. Although the newspaper article reported the witnesses lived in Elk Rapids, in actuality they live in a rural area of Antrim County and have a Kewadin, MI, mailing address. They both were present at the time of the interview appointment. GW, a 59-year-old woman, gave me a brief written report of her sighting, and a two-part sketch of what she saw. The 79-year-old witness (BW) was unwilling to give me a written report, but drew a sketch of the square win- dows she saw. BW described how her attention had been drawn to the kitchen window by the dog's behavior. She and her daughter had just begun to watch \"Wheel of Fortune.\" As she came out from the living room to attend to the barking dog, she saw bright lights out the south-facing kitchen window. They were toward the east and emerg-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2001 Page 11 ing from behind the pole barn. She immediately called her daughter GW to come and look. GW thought her mother was probably seeing mete- ors, since the Leniod Meteor Showers were expected to occur. Therefore, she told her mother they would prob- ably be out of sight by the time she would get to the kitchen. BW responded it was not like meteors, but a row of lights like an airplane with windows. In fact at first she thought it was a large airplane crashing. A long row of lights GW got up and joined her mother at the kitchen win- dow. She too could see a long row of lights. They both agreed that the length of the lights was like five railroad cars attached together. They appeared to be about five feet off the ground. BW could see what she described as square windows which seemed to be lit up with a bright fluorescent glow. She stated that she was looking in- tently into the windows to see if she could see people, since it appeared to be a plane crashing. She then said she should have known it was not a plane because planes have rounded windows on top, and these \"windows\" appeared square. She also told the investiga- tor that her left eye became watery, and she experienced blurred vision and a grainy feeling \"like sand\" in her eye ever since she had looked into the \"windows\"(this inter- view was six days after the sighting). BW cautioned the investigator, \"If you ever see anything like that, don't stare into the windows because you'll burn your eyes!\" They heard no sound. They described the object continuing to travel slowly to the north from behind the pole barn, just 25-30 feet from the east side of the house. GW wrote in her report (written account previously requested by this investiga- tor): \"Headed North was a string of lights going about 5 miles an hour (below the tree tops.) in the pasture. It looked like a train passing by. A whole person could stand in one window. The first windows were solid white. You couldn't penetrate into the interior with your eyes. The next lights seem to shimmer as they passed by, like 'pieces' of light.\" They estimated BW viewed the object for about three minutes and GW for about one minute. As the lights passed out of the view from the kitchen window, GW said she ran to the east windows at the back of the house to see if she could continue to see the object. The lights had disappeared. They saw nothing else. Unwilling to talk After the newspaper article appeared, GW and BW talked with a neighbor south of them who reported seeing a \"fireball with sparks and things\" at approximately the same time, but he was unwilling to talk to anyone about it. GW also had a phone call from the first witness in this report (the driver of the car who reported the lights over the landscape nursery). She, too, had seen GW's name in the newspaper article. They discussed together what each had seen. GW stated she had heard CC on \"Coast to Coast\" during Peter Davenport's report, after seem- ingly having had a \"telepathic message\" to turn on the radio to that program. GW also heard about a man on the other side of Cen- tral Lake, her sister's brother in-law, who had seen a large lighted object go over his son's home next door. She gave me the man's name and telephone number. (BW also reported her husband had seen a UFO \"years ago,\" and GW said she has a sister who saw a triangle-shaped ob- ject over by Central Lake about ten years ago.) Six days after I interviewed the first witness, I again spoke with B W by phone. She reported that she talked to her daughter who lives up on the hill to the northeast of her residence who reported seeing nothing unusual at the time of the sighting, but her draperies were drawn. Burned eye One of BW's grandsons (she said her grandsons run the farm) didn't believe her at first, but he did after her eye doctor diagnosed a burn to her left eye. BW made an appointment with her ophthalmologist because of the tearing, blurring, and sandy-feeling in her eye after the sighting. The doctor told her it would heal in about a week. I asked her to have the doctor write down the diagno- sis when she went back, but learned in a later interview that the doctor did not write it down. As they further described the sighting, B W said the object had appeared to be about half the size of the pasture (it is a very large pasture). BW also told me of talking to the pharmacy clerk at the Traverse City pharmacy where she went to get the prescription filled for her eye medication. The clerk had also seen something unexplained in the sky in the early evening of 11/16/99. Their conversation took place when BW was getting her prescription filled for medication to treat the eye injury. The next witness I learned about and was able to in- terview was JD, the man by Central Lake (sighting loca- tion #3 on the map) who had seen a large light pass over his son's mobile home sometime between 7 and 7:30 p.m. the same evening, Nov. 16,1999. He related he had been watching TV when all at once out the west window to the southwest he saw an oval- shaped light traveling slowly. At first he thought it might be car lights on the road, but then he realized the light was too far off the ground to be car lights, but it was not up very high. It was \"whitish\" in color, like a light bulb. He went out on the deck, which faces south, and saw the object pass relatively slowly over his son's mobile home, about 600-800 feet from him. It seemed to be about 150- 200 feet from the ground and over treetop level. There is a tree-covered hill behind their properties, and at first he thought it wasn't going to clear the hill, but it"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 June 2001 MUFON UFO Journal did, and it passed out of sight over the hill. There was absolutely no sound as the object passed by. It appeared to be the size of \"a housetrailer.\" There was no effect on the TV. JD seemed very clear about what he saw, and described the sighting very forthrightly. Another witness emerges Within a few days of the sighting I heard of DC, an- other person who had seen an unexplained large bright light out his window (sighting location #4 on the map) while he was watching TV in the early evening of Nov. 16,1999. A clerk in a local party store told me her father had seen something unexplainable the same evening as the other foregoing events. She checked with him and learned he would be willing to talk with me. Our interview was delayed several days because of an illness he was experiencing and the Thanksgiving holi- days, but we were able to meet for an interview on Dec. 8,1999. When I first talked with DC on the phone to get his information and to set up an appointment for an on- site interview, he spent considerable time telling me of a UFO sighting some years back by the whole family, off Elk Lake Road, within ten miles of their house. As I talked to him on the phone, I was confused about what information pertained to the current sighting and that which pertained to the previous sighting. When we met for the on-site interview, he was very clear about what he saw the evening of Nov. 16,1999, and gave me that information before talking at all about the previous sighting. He was watching TV sometime between 7 and 7:30 p.m. when his wife called his atten- tion to a bright white light streaking by that could be seen out the south-facing window (near the TV). The object was oval and had a tail. It moved fast, was only viewed for 1-2 seconds, then was gone. There was no sound. It appeared smaller than his fist at arm's length, about the size of a full moon on the horizon. It appeared about 50-100 feet off the ground, a little above the hori- zon. It moved from west to east, and appeared to be 50- 100 feet from the window. It did not cause any effect to the TV. He said he hadn't talked about it to anyone (ex- cept his daughters) because people might think he was weird. Other sightings DC then described the other sightings he has had in the past. About 26 years ago he saw an object he couldn' t identify moving slowly west toward Grand Traverse Bay viewed from Elk Lake Road. He said the whole family saw it and got out of the car to watch it. Another time in the past he said he saw 13 objects moving together. Also present at this on-site interview was his wife, a 36-year-old daughter, and her two young children. His wife was in agreement with the report. The daughter related her memory of the object the family saw in 1973. It was disc or saucer shaped and had a rounded \"dome thing\" on top, and the appearance of windows around the dome-shaped part. She said it made a whirring sound, then all of a sudden \"took off and was gone. Her father related it went to- ward the southwest over \"the Bay\" (Grand Traverse Bay). All of them were very scared. This daughter was a 10- year-old at the time; the other daughters were 8,14 and 16. This daughter also related an experience her hus- band had when he was working on Elk Rapids Golf Course; a \"ball of light\" came over his head and caused the golf cart he was riding on to stop. After the ball of light \"took off the golf cart started again. She wasn't certain just when.this incident had occurred. I learned of two other persons in the area who saw a bright fiery light (sighting location #5 on map) in the sky the evening of Nov. 16,1999 shortly after 7 p.m. Two women acquaintances of mine, MJ and SM, were travel- ing south in a car on East Torch Lake Drive. They were about 5 1/2 miles southeast of the last witness's location and about 11 miles south of JD's location (#3 on the map) near the 15-mile Polar Trail marker of South East Torch Lake Drive. Greenish, then reddish The object was moving from west to east. They slowed the car when they saw the object, which was above the treetops at horizon level. It was greenish, and then the front changed to reddish. They saw it separate into 3 or 4 parts, then it was whitish as they lost sight of it behind the trees that grew on the hill on the east side of the road. They were convinced it must have been \"the meteor breaking up\" they had heard about later on the radio and TV. The last witness I interviewed regarding an unexplained object in the sky shortly after 7 p.m. on Nov. 16,1999, was the clerk (SM) in the Traverse City pharmacy. She saw the object from her car at approximately 7:15 p.m. (sighting location # 6, off the map). She said at first it was like a ball with a tail behind, then it looked like a plane on fire and bigger than a 747. The fire appeared to bum out and there appeared to be lights behind. It appeared to have square windows all in a line and moved slowly. She observed the object for several minutes from Duck Lake Road (approximately 25-30 miles southwest of sight- ing location #1) and thought the altitude appeared to be approximately 5000 feet. She said it moved like a plane would that was approaching an airport to land. Her teen- aged daughter was in the car with her and also observed the object. The next day she discounted any thoughts of a UFO when she heard a disk jockey commenting on the radio that many people saw something unexplained over the Grawn area, and the official report was that it was a meteor. I sent the last witness a MUFON UFO Sighting Ques- tionnaire form to complete and sign, since she was hesi- tant to meet for another face-to-face interview. (The first interview had been in the pharmacy at the time of my"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2001 Page 13 Those checking out the \"Missouri spook light\" (actually slightly into Oklahoma) this spring included Bob & Dawn Soetebier, Nancy Talbott, JoAnne Scarpellini, and Carolyn and Dwight Connelly, among others. There were a couple of false alarms, but no spook light on this night. attempt to locate her initially. Therefore the interview was brief and incomplete.) By Feb. 21,2000,1 still had not received the form back from SM, so I phoned her. She admitted to feeling some- what uncomfortable about completing and signing the form. I emphasized to her that her name would be kept confidential if she wished. By the end of our conversa- tion she stated I could use her name if I wished, but I assured her it would be kept confidential because of her uncomfortable feelings. Sleep paralysis? During our conversation she shared a memory she had in the past of \"sleep paralysis.\" She described an inci- dent where she was just awakening and thought she could feel a hand on the top of her head, but was unable to move. She asked me if I had ever had such an experi- ence, because she understood it might be quite common. I told her I had read of others having had that sort of experience. When we finished talking, she said she planned to look for the form and send it back to me if she could find it. Contributing to her discomfort about talking about her sighting apparently are things her husband has said to her about not talking to people about it because they'll think she's \"nuts.\" She has talked to her boss at the pharmacy, however, who shared with her a \"dream\" his 8-year-old daughter told them one morning about a spaceship. He said they told her it was only a dream, but she insisted she had been awake! When I asked the witness if she thought he would want to talk to anyone about it, she didn't think he would at this point, but she says she is keeping my card for future reference. On Nov. 20,1999,1 made a call to the Northwestern Regional Airport, the closest airport to the areas where the sightings occurred. I spoke with the supervisor of the Air Traffic Control Tower, who said there was nothing reported to them by any pilot, and they do not have radar that could have detected objects in the areas of the sightings. The closest radar center for this area is Min- neapolis. He said that often people confuse Air Force plane refueling for UFO's. He returned my call later and said \"Lansing\" reported the object people saw that evening was a meteor. On Nov. 29,1999,1 made calls to the Traverse City TV stations. One of the newsmen told me they had doz- ens of calls the evening of 11/16/99. Most people saw colored lights, mostly greenish, then there was a \"separa- tion\" like lights breaking up. The \"official word\" was that it was a meteor breaking up. Coast Guard contacted On Dec. 6,1999.1 called the US Coast Guard Opera- tions center after learning that CC, the witness who called the National UFO Reporting Center, had obtained the phone number from the Coast Guard. I spoke with the US Coast Guard operations director, who told me they had two planes up that evening because of all the calls from people who saw something that looked like an air- plane on fire. He was the pilot of one of the planes, and told me they confirmed it was not an aircraft on fire. He said \"Lan- sing\" reported it was a meteor. He would not say what he personally thought it was. He said he and the other pilot viewed it with night vision goggles, and he repeated they confirmed it was not an aircraft on fire. On Dec. 12,1999,1 phoned one of the owners of the landscape nursery over whose home and business the object of \"sighting location #1\" was seen. The home sits in the center of the landscape nursery area. The owner said a neighbor had reported to them that a UFO had been seen over their house at shortly after 7 p.m. the evening of 11/16/99, but they neither saw nor heard any- thing, and they were home at the time. She said they didn't leave the house until about 7:50 p.m. that evening. After turning in my preliminary report, MUFON's Deputy Director of Investigations Dan Wright requested that I try to obtain data regarding the \"official report\" of a meteor breaking up or an \"earth grazer\" (as reported in the 11/18/99 news article). I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to get \"official\" information. I discovered an e-mail address for questions to NASA, but they re- ferred me to CUFOS. Neither CUFOS nor I know why I was referred to them. So what was it that was seen by the witnesses? Me- teors that have square windows? \"Earth grazers\" with distinct lights? A meteor gliding slowly over treetops or 5 feet off the ground moving south to north? (The \"offi- cial\" report described the object moving from west to east.) Why did NASA not respond to my inquiry, other than referring me to the Center for UFO Studies?"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 June 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Filer's Files By George A.

She said, \"It kind of spooked me out at first, because it wasn't making a noise and it was flying low.

Globe reported in Ohio CADIZ - The witness was coming home from work on April 19,2001, when he noticed a white light globe off in the distance over his house at 11:55 p.m. He states, \"It is very unusual for craft to fly low over my small town residence. As I got closer to my home the globe started moving very quickly across the sky. It would move east, then stop on a dime, and move west, stop again and go straight up and east. \"I pulled in my driveway and the white light globe low- ered itself to three miles away. It hovered again and the white light turned red. It stood there for a few seconds, then started west, the red light began flashing fast like a strobe light, and it just vanished. I live outside of town with few lights, and I could hear dogs all over town bark- ing. When the light vanished all the dogs stopped barking. Two days ago at midnight I was watching TV when my entire house started shaking very faintly, though enough that my candles were vibrating off the window.\" The witness is a very respected person in his commu- nity with a degree in law enforcement. He ran inside, grabbed his camcorder and drove to the top of the hill where you can see for miles, but the light never came back. Intercept in Ohio? James Greenen, a MUFON field investigator, reports that on April 24 and 25,2001, on paltalk.com, an Internet chatroom, a gentleman who runs that site said he had a UFO fly over his car. The UFO stopped his car. He observed an F-15 at full throttle with wings back and afterburners on break the sound barrier and pull up alongside of the UFO that sud- denly made a quick left hand turn in front of the F-15. His dad observed a UFO the night before and got pictures of it.

A plane flew underneath the UFO, and as it went under, the red lights appeared on the UFO as if it were giving a warning. \"The UFO started moving slowly at first, gaining speed toward the right, and then it came to a stop and hovered for about five minutes. Then a small star-shaped object branched off of it and started flying straight up and around as if it were in orbit with the earth, but still in the atmo- sphere. The star-shaped light disappeared, but we contin- ued to watch the other object as it started moving further away and disappeared. It was neither a plane nor a star, and I have never seen any thing like this before.\" Indiana object reported The witness on April 18,2001, was traveling on Inter- state 90 in Indiana, near the Illinois state line, and \"no- ticed a cross-like or star-like object in the sky. It was very bright opaque white, and larger than surrounding stars. The object was above horizon as we traveled late in the night. The object rose vertically and moved in the oppo- site direction we were traveling. \"I moved forward in my seat and turned my head up- ward and to the left as it passed over the roof of the vehicle. When the object was passing I got a good side view and a bit of the back of the object. There were many small red lights curved around the base, and the lights flashed on either side of the craft.

The red lights curving gave the impression that the object was circular, or at least the base was circular. I viewed a bright, white cross-like or star like object with many smaller red lights. I will confirm time with my spouse.\" Peter Davenport of NUFORC spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite lucid and serious-minded in her description of the event. Texas object reported GRAHAM — Donna B. writes, \"On April 24,2001, at approximately 10:30 a.m. I observed a large oval object in the southeastern sky; it was silver in color and was hovering.

One was even caught on video. Now a 34-year-old Wirksworth man, who asked not to be named, says he saw a giant disk-shaped craft over Idridgehay. He was driving to market in Derby at 3:00 a.m. when he saw the UFO hovering near the road. In addition, he was the first person who'd seen the UFOs to admit feeling afraid of what he saw. \"It did frighten me because I couldn't explain what it was,\" he remarked. \"I've never seen anything like this before, and logic couldn't explain it. It was shocking. I've never been be- liever in UFOs and sightings, but I believe in them now.\" The man said the craft was hovering above woods and seemed to rotate. It had blue, red, and white lights. The incident follows another sighting of three flying saucers above Youlgrave last Wednesday. Thanks to Gerry @ Farshores Sightings increase in Germany MANNHEIM — Christian Siedenbiedel reports that the German UFO Registration Office run by Werner Walter has been stressed out since the beginning of Feb- ruary. \"A new UFO craze has started in Germany,\" groans the 43-year-old man who has headed the Office for the past 10 years. \"Forty unidentified flying objects in six weeks-that's more than hi 1999 and 2000 put together.\" Walter puts some of the blame for this latest wave of UFO hysteria on increased television coverage of the crash of the Russian Mir space station, the planet Venus, and disco searchlights. A woman in the town of Konstanz, claimed she had seen a cylindrical object that was several hundred meters (yards) long above her on the market square in broad daylight. A witness in Hamburg observed a \"classical\" flying saucer with a diameter of 30 meters (100 feet).

UFO reported in Brunei GADONG — On April 26,2001, a husband and wife claimed that they had seen an unknown flying object in Gadong's airspace at around 12:30 a.m. They were on their way home from a dinner occasion when Philip Chua, 33, and wife, Silvia Goh Mei Ling, 28, were shocked by the bright object in the skies. They had earlier seen the UFO around the area of Jalan Tungku Link. Coincidentally, he had a camera with him, so he stopped his car and took pictures of the object, but the object van- ished as if \"it\" knew someone was taking pictures, he said when interviewed by Media Permata. Upon passing a bridge near Emperor's Court, the wife claimed that they saw an object that appeared again near Rimba. The next day; Chua sent the film to his friend's shop to be developed. Strangely, while his friend was pro- cessing the film, the shop's power was cut off for an hour. However, Chua felt relief as the object was cap- tured on the film. He spread the word around his friends.

Box 511, Trenton MI. 48183-0511 Reviewed by Dwight Connelly In this interesting book the author ex- pands on the basic hypothesis developed by Barry Downing and many others that at least some parts of the Old and New Tes- taments have a rela- tionship with UFOs. A diemaker for the Ford Motor Company since the age of 18, Twichell retired at the age of 52, and has stud- ied the Bible, UFOs, abductions, and psychic phenomena since his own sighting in 1962. As the title suggests, Twichell comes to what many would see as a logical conclusion: the star of Bethlehem and the virgin birth of Jesus were the products of extra- terrestrial intervention. However, much of this book deals with other phenom- ena, such as astral projection (out-of-body experiences), near death experiences, reincarnation, other dimensions, metaphysics, spirits, and seances. The UFO-Jesus Con- nection should be read with the idea of provoking thought, rather than proving specific claims, since solid documen- tation is not emphasized. For example, Twichell relates that our astronauts sight- ing large spaceships on the moon, the report being based on radio transmissions allegedly intercepted by \"unnamed radio hams, using VHP receiving facilities.\" He goes on to state that this transmission was confirmed by Otto Binder, identified as a former NASA employee, as well as astro- naut Neil Armstrong, but omits details regarding when and where this confirmation was given. If documented, this would undoubtedly be one of the biggest events in ufology. Twichell also has his own interpretation of Biblical his- tory which would not necessarily be totally accepted by other Bible scholars, such as \"the sole purpose\" of the fifth Ecumenical Council was \"to permanently squelch, once and for all, the reincarnation dogma.\" He discusses several UFO cases, apparently with the dual purpose of convincing the doubters that UFOs are real, and to show the possible relationship of modern cases to descriptions of Biblical events, interpreting these cases to reflect the points he is trying to make. Twichell seems nearly as suspicious of the established Western church as he is of the federal government, ques- tioning, for example, whether the newer versions of the Bible are an attempt to cloud the fact that Heaven is lo- cated in the sky. He also makes significant use of The Apocrypha, seemingly placing it on an equal footing with the Holy Bible in making some of his points. This book is an interesting summation of Twichell's research. As noted, one might wish for more documen- tation, but certainly he gives readers some interesting read- ing, as well as something to think about-which he sug- gests is his basic purpose: \"What I propose in this volume may not be the last word on the matter. It may well be as far off base as one could get. However, it is a theory based on the culmina- tion of my findings and personal experiences through the years. I ask you only to examine the evidence, add your own knowledge and personal experiences, and draw your own conclusions. If you are right, you're right. If not...keep digging.\" Fair enough.

There has been a lot of progress in unravelling this matter recently. We have long known that the UK was one of the first countries to debate UFOs in its parliament. In fact this happened as long ago as 1913. This was a time just before the outbreak of World War I when fears of a German invasion were high. Then admirality lord Winston Churchill (three decades before he led the country against the Nazi threat) became intrigued and concerned by sightings of strange lights in the sky that in retrospect we can recognise as very similar to the US airship wave of 1896/7. As a result he posed questions and demanded answers from ministers. Because these lights were often seen in vulnerable locations (channel ports and the eastern coast) there were inevitable fears that they might be Zeppelins that were spying as a prelude to invasion. After the war it became clear thar no such threat from Germany was then possible, and Churchill's warnings were probably as much a political manipulation of the UFO scare as they were a genuine belief mat the Kaiser was using air power and might bomb London (an idea being popularised by political science fiction stories from people like HG Wells). Indeed, the truth is likely to be that many of these sightings were misperceptions of the planet Venus-very bright and easy to see from coastal towns and the flat East Anglian landscape at the time, and readily triggering social panic given the prevailing circumstances. But this at least demonstrates that the British government were willing to take a UFO threat seriously long ago. Secrecy rules: Britain's obsession with secrecy (as it must seem from an American perspective) needs to be seen in context. For the past 100 years this island has lived under the con- stant fear of invasion. Between 1940 and 1942 in particu- lar it stood alone facing a Europe overrun by Hitler with the expectation of a massed seaborne landing and con- stant aerial attack as an everyday occurrence. Even after the war a vast array of radar, front line air bases and nuclear missiles were lined up along the east facing the Soviet Union, and this expectation of imminent attack from over the water was still a constant undercur- rent. Even today, in a post cold war era, much of this tech- nology is still there-at places like the Fylingdales radar base and the Menwith Hill complex in Yorkshire (oper- ated by the NSA) as well as the still active air bases of East Anglia, such as Lakenheath. It is inevitable that major security precautions were necessary, and this instilled a mentality into the population as a whole (not to mention the miltary). So a \"cover-up to protect oneself way of life has simply become so engrained into British society that it shows only slow signs of eroding-despite growing protestations about civil lib- erties. Britain has no freedom of information laws on the same level as the US (although this is a position that has changed under the Blair govern- ment to provide signs of free flowing infomation at all). It does have a very strict Official Secrets Act that actively prevents information from being shared with the public. All service personnel (and many others in non-active posts) have to sign this to prevent them sharing data that the powers-that-be feel would be unwise to let out. This has pervaded life so much that there have been several foolish attempts to ban memoirs written by former government workers, despite the fact that these books can easily be published outside the UK and brought back into the country quite legally (!) and with the internet era meaning that they can also be on line in moments. Restrictions such as banning the release of inventories from government canteens (presumably in case the en- emy blockade supplies of a particular brand of tea!) have occurred. And more disturbing civil liberties issues (such as patients not even having automatic right of access to their own medical records). These have ensured that much hope of getting the kind of information from the British government about UFOs that is now commonplace in other nations has been a long time in coming. But the pressure of membership of the EC (the Euro- pean Union) and the sheer inevitablity that some kind of FOI act had to come about has gradually eased the situa- tion. Now, for the first time, we have a genuine burst of knowledge as to British government interest in UFOs. Data is flowing onto the public record, and the end of the cover up as we know it is certainly in sight. Power games: In the not too distant past the only thing we knew about the MoD (Ministry of Defence) interest in UFOs was what they chose to tell us. They had a department-run"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 June 2001 MUFON UFO Journal what they chose to tell us. They had a department-run basically by a middle rank civil servant-that spent a very limited amount of time collating reports from the public. This had existed since the early 1960s at least (the earliest date to which records were kept-the MoD claiming they had routinely destroyed them at 5-year intervals prior to a 1967 wave that saw the government order their reten- tion). This department, variously known as \"DS 8\" (Defence Secretariat) and, more recently, Air Staff 2 A, had an officer who did a lot of paper work and interacted with the public on issues like low flying aircraft complaints and funny lights in the sky. UFOlogists got to know these people (who generally stayed a couple of years then moved up-this was not seen as a prestigious job). I have exchanged letters over the years with maybe 10 of these people and met one (Pam Titchmarsh) when in August 1983 she was caught off guard and agreed to discuss the Rendlesham Forest case after I and two col- leagues turned up at her door waving the then not publicly disclosed (and banned) Halt memo. From these discussions the MoD position on UFOs was trotted out (as it still is by the present incumbant) almost like a litany. The words are virtually copied from 30 years ago in fact! The MoD investigates UFOs to discover if they have any defence potential. They have never found cases that do, but cannot pre- sume none ever will appear. They do not investigate be- yond ruling out the defence potential to a point where any identification behind a UFO is proven. Although some- times they \"guess\" at answers in figures released (sug- gesting in the release these are more than guesses when in truth they rarely are). Most people in this posting have no interest in UFOs. The job is a chore, and they probably find it pretty awful having to answer letters from fervent UFO enthusiasts convinced they are engaging in a cover up of major alien contacts when they never get that kind of case. I once asked the person in charge why they never re- lease information on cases like Lakenheath in 1956 (an alleged multiwitness radar-visual during which RAF planes were sent on an intercept), and was told-following a de- nial that the Air Staff had even heard of the story-\"You tell us about cases like this. We never get them.\" All of which certainly left me curious. And that curios- ity was further aroused when the man who ran this office between 1991 and 1994 decided two years later to write his exploits as a book and enter the UFO lecture circuit. That man is Nick Pope, now well known as a UFOlogist and still working with the MoD (in another capacity). I had exchanged letters with Nick during his time at the Air Staff, as I was Director of Investigations with Britain's primary national group (BUFORA). Whilst he offered the usual platitudes in his written replies, his per- sonal interest in UFOs shone through from day one and he often went the extra mile and assisted on cases and even was happy to have personal discussions with inves- tigators about ongoing cases. His opinions about the sub- ject are no sham. He was a rarity-a genuinely interested person in a job to which most others never gave much thought. But in his own way Nick affirmed to me the real problem with the MoD's position on UFOs. The dichotomy The problem is, if the MoD tell the truth (and I think the Air Staff do tell the truth as they see it), then how can they justify keeping open this department? A department that takes up money and yet appears never to get any really interesting cases, never has any that actually im- pinge on the MoD's responsibility (defence) and, so far as their records go, are nearly all explained away as misperceptions? Imagine you set up a government office 40 years ago to determine whether any government minister ever grew two heads. You quickly established that this idea is rather silly and that none ever did so. In fact reports to this ef- fect usually have no hard evidence to support them. Nor did the issue of government ministers having two heads ever remotely affect national security, since it never re- ally happened. How long do you think that department would survive cost cutting measures and a media deter- mined to root out frivolity? So, in effect, the MoD could only really justify still pur- suing UFO investigations if this work was in some way useful. But according to the statements it makes it is hard to see in what ways it can be useful if it never finds what it is looking for! One possible caveat I have heard is that UFO data is like a ground observer corps for possible aircraft flying over us from a foreign power, so the sightings serve that purpose of logging data. But given the lethargy of MoD investigation-send out a letter, wait for a reply, etc, etc-and the instantaneous radar and other coverage long available, it is absurd to think that the MoD would rely on reports from ordinary citizens to tell them anything they did not already know by better means. When Nick Pope published his first book, Open Skies, Closed Minds, in 1996 it rather made the same point. I had hoped he would reveal startling cases that the MoD preferred not to talk about, but he would-the sort that made it necessary to be prudent and keep open the Air Staff office. The kind of case that all UFO groups get now and again that makes us realise that amidst the stars and aircraft and meteor misperceptions \"something\" is clearly going on. Yet, whilst I have no doubt that Nick really does be- lieve in UFOs and the ETH from the accumulation of data he has seen, it cannot really be as a consequence of what he is telling us is in the MoD files. Since these barely reflect any UFO reality, let alone alien presence, most are trivia, and even the best often have possible resolu-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal June 2001 Page 19 tions, his view seems to depend more on the wider concensus of UFO evidence-the sort of case that im- presses many UFOlogists. But the sort of case that ap- parently the Air Staff don't much see. His book revealed very little that was not known to UFOlogy, and contained no stunning cases during his time at the Air Staff. I suspect BUFORA probably got a few better cases during the same three years. So, as noted, his revelations (honest as I am sure they are) did not ex- plain to me why this Air Staff department actually sur- vives. Yet survive it still does-five years after Nick's book. In search of secret files In my conversations with Nick, he has made clear that he thinks his department \"was\" essentially the MoD UFO team, and there was no secret department somewhere getting the better cases. I am sure he believes that. But I do suspect that he may not be correct. Why not? Many rea- sons. For one I spoke at length to a man, Ralph Noyes-in fact he gave me an on-camera in- terview (as did Nick Pope) for a documentary that I made in 1996 for BBC television, and it proved a swarisong, as he died soon afterwards. Noyes was (in the 1960s and 1970s) head of an entire MoD division that included the Air Staff Unit that Pope later ran. Although Ralph was no ETH supporter, he was certain that there were real UFOs and believed that the MoD were baffled as to their true nature (hence the on- going monitor). He told me that he had seen gun camera film taken from RAF jets in pursuit of these objects. I asked Nick Pope, but he was never shown this footage. To me that (along with other things Noyes told me) implies that there may be UFO data that exists in places that the people who run the Air Staff team never get to see. Presumably the reason is obvious. They don't have a high enough clearance. Then there are the high level military witnesses, such as Wing Commander Cyril George Towsend Withers (a wonderfully old style British name!) He had a remark- able daylight encounter whilst on board an experimental RAF jet engaged in secret radar experiments. And he was never debriefed. Puzzled as to why the MoD were so disinterested, he pushed and could only discover that beyond the official Air Staff that acted as an interface with the public there was a more covert research centre that was coming to the conclusion that UFOs might in- deed be alien craft. They were so secret they relied on methods other than witness interview so as to not alert the public to their presence. But he never found out more than that. De- spite his high rank he had no need to know. Then there were the mysterious Men in Black. In 1997 I published a book on my research into this area (The truth behind the MIB, St Martins Press) and reported that witness after witness in the UK had alleged to me (and others) visitation by figures from the MoD who had effectively persuaded them into silence. There was no way these people were all making this story up. It was too consistent. And there was a clear pattern to the kind of case that brought this response (only a small percentage of all sightings did). I asked Nick Pope to comment. He said that the Air Staff did not send people out whom these witnesses could be describing (although pos- sibly as a personal interest in the past a few such visits may have occurred from air base commanders). But these witnesses were not seeing uniformed officers or people correctly identifying themselves as \"Lt A from the local base.\" They were .being visited by government agents with some kind of research unit. So Nick suggested to me that these witnesses were mistakenly describing encounters'with what he termed \"Walter Mitty\" characters-basically screwball UFOlogists who had pretended to be from a secret government agency to get their kicks. Once or twice maybe. Often over the years? I doubt it! I am sure Nick thought this the best answer to this dilemma. But I don'tbuy it. These witnesses that I have met have in my view been visited by just who they say they have-some government agency sufficiently inter- ested to try to silence them. These people are not threat- ened (Al Bender style). They are persuaded in diplomatic fashion that it is in their best interests not to talk. Crack- pot UFOlogists would not be that subtle! Moreover, the gradual trickle of information from the MoD in recent times adds to the evidence for this secret department. The UFO documentation has gone onto the Public Record Office in Kew, and I and others have haunted the place perusing its dusty shelves. Although most of the data released is 30 years old (as the MoD have a policy to retain information from public view for at least that long, sometimes much longer), there is now a trend to give up more and more, and old rules can bend."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Page 20 June 2001 MUFON UFO Journal The picture that has been emerging is very clear from these hard documents. There \"are\" other agencies be- yond the Air Staff that pursue UFO reports. One of these is the DSTI (Directorate of Scientific and Technical In- telligence), where intelligence officers and MoD scien- tists study interesting cases. Often they take over the best cases from the Air Staff. And whilst there is some feed- back to the Air Staff, it seems limited, and the DSTI records themselves are much more elusive. If, for ex- ample, the high grade cases went direct to DSTI and by- passed the Air Staff (as they may do in some way), then it might be difficult to find out. The other agency involved is a Defence Intelligence Unit, whose identity was accidentally revealed when it was not properly censored off a few released files. This covert intelligence agency unit is probably from where the visits to witnesses originate. Indeed there is mounting evidence of this from a careful piecing together of the files at the Public Record Office. So where now? Where does this leave us? It is increasingly apparent that the Air Staff team is a bit like a shop window. The MoD put a clerk there to deal with the awkward custom- ers (noisy UFOlogists, for instance) and to field the largely unwanted trivia from the public-all the aircraft and stars they misreport as UFOs. It serves a useful purpose of showing to the nation that they are doing something about UFOs, and the officer put in charge has no awareness of anything much beyond this (other than realising that DSTI exists, as they sometimes consult with them on UFO is- sues). But so far as these civil service clerical officers are concerned they are running the UFO shop and can hon- estly answer questions-like do you get any alien abduc- tions or car stops reported-by saying, \"No we don't. You tell us about these, but we never see them.\" However, there is a secret workshop that exists some- where at the back of the store. The public don't see it- only the shop window with this poor clerk trying to be truthful and facing the wrath of the public who think they are involved in a cover up (when they are not). The workshop gets the high grade cases direct from other sources (eg jet intercepts), and possibly also seeks to pre- vent any publicly reported cases of importance from get- ting too widely discussed by meeting and disuading the witness. The civil servant in the shop window may well not know how he or she is being used. So where is this covert location? The quest has been on to use Britain's allegedly new-found interest in free- dom of information to hunt for it, and to access these previously unseen files. Quite a few people are now con- vinced it does exist. Just before his death, Ralph Noyes told me he had found it and spoken to the place, and they were stunned that he bluffed through with his UFO knowl- edge and high level of MoD clearance. A few people know where it is. Efforts are ongoing to test the resolve of the British government to withhold this information at the same time as making public statements about accountability. Things are happening, and I am quite hopeful that we might learn if there is such a secret repository of UFO data, and, if so, what exists there. We may be closer than ever before to finally resolving the question: why does the MoD investigate a phenom- enon that publicly it seems to be saying has no aapparent relevance to national security? Strieber cancels Internet conference; says fragment not extraterrestrial Whitley Strieber has posted an announcement to his website in which he states that the Roswell fragment, which was to be the focal point of a May 12 Internet UFO conference-since cancelled-is of earthly origin and shows no signs of being extraterrestrial. Strieber had said earlier, \"We also have non-earth iso- topic ratios in the object. This is as close to proof that the object was manufactured on another world as any ever obtained.\" He also stated that the object was so unusual that it was impossible to take clear photos of it. He now says, \"I had not been given all the information about the early testing of the object when I made the statement ...I was led to believe that the only tests ever done on the object showed extraordinary isotopic ratios. I was given copies of these tests, and they appeared to be in good order and entirely legitimate.\" Roswell Museum lectures announced The following lectures are scheduled at the Interna- tional UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, NM, all at 7 p.m., and all free.

Hall As one of the most popular subjects on the internet, UFOs are represented by hundreds of web sites. The UFO discussion sites predictably attract all sorts of ill- informed commentary and endless speculation. The level of dialogue often is \"lower than a snake's belly.\" The degree of ignorance (lit- erally) displayed of UFO facts and history is truly phenomenal among the discussion groups, and offhand opinions and wild speculations fly as freely as \"saucers.\" On the other hand, if you know where to look, the internet can be a valuable source of good information relevant to careful scientific study. I briefly review here some of the more important and valuable web sites. First, a few that are in a class by themselves. (1) The Computer UFO Network site (www.cufon.org) is one of the oldest and best, containing excellent reports, documents, and interviews, rich in both historical and cur- rent information. It also publishes Barry Greenwood's \"UFO Historical Review.\" (2) The NICAP site (www.nicap.dabsol.co.uk) is a special favorite of mine, since it preserves information about the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and is also rich in general historical informa- tion, including case reports and photographs. In addition, it houses (includes a link to) Michael Hall's Project Blue Book Research Center web site. (3) The Project Sign Research Center site (www.projectsign.com) is temporarily off-line, but will be back up this summer. It is a marvelous repository of early Air Force UFO history and an invaluable archive of UFO- related and historical photographs. (4) The National UFO Reporting Center (www.ufocenter.com), a primary source of current and past sighting data, with photographs and statistics. (5) Project 1947 site (www.project47.com), which re- ports detailed information about the earliest U.S. sighting records and documentation, and has a link to the site of the Sign Historical Group, specializing in historical records. Two sites by (and more or less for) scientists are: Dr. Bruce Maccabee, physicist (www.brumac.8k.com) and Dr. Bernard Haisch, astronomer (www.ufoskeptic.org). The latter openly asks scientists who are skeptical to take a new look at the evidence. Organizational sites: Mutual UFO Network (www.mufon.com), Center for UFO Studies (www.cufos.org), and Fund for UFO Research (www.fufor.com). The FUFOR site, at this writing, is badly in need of updating, but still contains valuable refer- ence information. UFO abduction sites: Budd Hopkins' Intruders Foun- dation (www.intrudersfoundation.org) and David Jacobs' International Center for Abduction Research (www.ufoabduction.com). My personal Authors Guild web site (www.hallrichard.com) contains both a UFO Page (with news, links, photos) and a Donald E. Keyhoe Archives page in honor of my mentor and friend for whom I worked at NICAP. For general UFO-related news and information of all types see www.ufoupdates.com and www.ufocity.com. Both contain a mixed bag of solid UFO information and rumors, speculation, you name it. On balance, they do a good job of reporting on the overall UFO scene, warts and all. My recent participation in discussions on the UFO Updates site has been highly educational. It has led me to advocate ignoring both of the extremes-total scoffers and ga-ga believers alike-neither of whom has anything worth- while to contribute toward resolving the real issues. Ev- eryone else in between, whether honest doubters (true skeptics) or convinced advocates of a real mystery, then ought to be able to engage in more civil discussion and debate, and work together in studying the phenomenon or phenomena. Some of us have been trying to practice that approach. It remains to be seen whether constructive cooperation will be possible. However, implicit in this suggestion is zero tolerance for con men, frauds, and opportunists of all stripes. The level of gullibility about people like Greer and Corso, very similar in their megalomaniacal claims, is totally ap- palling to me. (And George Adamski before them, as I commented on last time.) Uncritical thinking opens the doors to manipulation of the UFO subject by people whose agendas have nothing to do with objective truth-seeking. They have a \"Brooklyn Bridge\" to sell you. That's my opinion. What's yours? Address your let- ters to the Editor, and if you have questions for me, I would be delighted to devote one or more columns to an- swering them. Or trying to! Please don't ask me what it all means, or what the apparent \"aliens\" are up to, or why they haven't landed and made open contact. I don't have a clue. As a philosopher, I have far more questions than an- swers."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Page 22 June 2001 MUFON UFO Journal The NIGHT SKY Walter N. Webb July 2001 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, though still noticeably bright in Ophiuchus, drops from magnitude -2.2 to -1.5 during July. The little ochre planet stands about 20 degrees high in the SSE at midtwilight and progresses westward. On the 19th it re- sumes its normal eastward motion against the stars. Mars can be seen near the star Antares. (The star's name is from the Greek for \"rival of Mars,\" a reference to its similar reddish tint.) The planet sets in the WSW soon after 2 AM (mid-July). See June's Night Sky for a brief description of telescopic features on Mars. Dawn Planet-Moon Spectacle: After Jupiter (-1.9) and Mercury emerge together in the morning sky the 1st week of July, a total of 4 planets are then arrayed in the ENE and E, producing an ever- changing show throughout the month. Find a clear unob- structed horizon in order to view the Jupiter-Mercury pair. Events follow (1 hour before sunrise): 1. July 9. Mercury at its farthest point (21 degrees) from the Sun. Look for it low in the ENE only 4 degees to the right of bright Jupiter. 2. Venus (-4.1), Saturn (-0.3), and the star Aldebaran form a close triangle all month. From July 11-17, the trio fits within a 5 degree binocular field. Watch the 2 planets close in on each other. 3. July 13. Jupiter and Mercury only 2 degrees apart. 4. July 15. Venus only 0.7 degree below Saturn. 5. July 17. Crescent Moon joins Venus, Saturn, and Aldebaran. The Moon occults Venus just before sunrise in Hawaii, after 10 AM on the West Coast, and after 2:30 PM on the East Coast. For the daytime event, Venus will be 42 degrees W of the Sun, so the planet and the Moon should be located in the sky with the help of both the naked eye and binoculars. 6. July 18. Mercury, Jupiter, the Moon, Venus, and Sat- urn are strung in a line spanning 27 degrees. 7. July 19. Thin lunar crescent very near Mercury. From the Pacific NW and Alaska, the Moon occults the planet before sunrise. Meteor Shower: The South Delta Aquarid meteors reach their maxi- mum on the mornings of July 28 and 29. Without a Moon to interfere, observers may see up to about 20 yellowish meteors per hour streaking out of Aquarius in the S. Moon Phases: Full moon—July 5 Last quarter—July 1-3 New moon—July 20 First quarter—July 27 The Stars: The summer constellations are well established now. After dark the Summer Triangle nears the zenith. Her- cules kneels upsidedown on the head of Draco the Dragon whose string of faint stars curves like a giant distorted \"S\" across the northern sky. Another serpentine charac- ter, Serpens, is carried by Ophiuchus, who is shaped some- what like an Arabian tent. And below Ophiuchus the Ser- pent-Bearer, Scorpius the Scorpion, seeks to escape the arrow of the Centaur Sagittarius, who better resembles a teapot. In mythology the great warrior Orion died from the sting of Scorpius. Both were honored with a place in the heavens, but they were so positioned that they never ap- pear in the sky at the same time. Orion sets just as Scor- pius rises, and vice versa. July 20-22, MUFON 2001 International UFO Sym- posium, Hyatt Regency Irvine, Irvine, CA. Theme: Join- ing the Cosmic Neighborhood. See Page 23.

New T-shirts MUFON member William Muravsky suggested a design for a special T-shirt for MUFON Field Investiga- tors. The design is akin to a swat team shirt with MUFON in large letters on the back, along with the words \"Field Investigator.\" The plan is to sell the new shirt in addition to the traditional MUFON shirt. We are working with the designers and hope to launch this project in June. Newsletters appreciated The MUFON UFO Journal staff appreciates re- ceiving newsletters from local MUFON groups. Not only does this keep us better informed, but occasionally there will be news from the local groups that deserves national/international coverage."}]
