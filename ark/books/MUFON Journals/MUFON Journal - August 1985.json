This issue of the Journal, with its complete print and picture coverage of the 1985 St. Louis Symposium. In addition, there's a preview of the activities planned for the first national UFO Information Week, presented by Marge Christensen, and commentary and suggestions by Larry Bryant concerning the present status of UFO secrecy. Also, most of our usual departments, including The Night Sky, In Others' Words, and Director's Message. Was UFO Week a success? In terms of the first, nationwide concerted effort of its kind, undoubtedly. But the bottom line, as with most PR programs, is one of dollars. Publicity MUFON, CUFOS and the Fund for UFO Research got. For the momentum to be maintained, however, such organizations need to have brought in new subscribers and increased operating funds. Whether that will prove the case remains to be seen. What is clear, even at this early stage, is that we not rest on our laurels and remember that there are another fifty-one weeks in the year. UFOs don't take vacations. Why should we?

Sponsored by the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis, the Symposium featured a stellar line-up of speakers and, for the first time, a complete videotaping of the full program. Saturday morning, the proceed- ings got underway with an early welcome by John Schroeder of St. Louis, who served a delightful stint as Master of Ceremonies. MUFON's International Director, Walt Andrus, then greeted the assembled attendees who had come from as far away as Australia. The first Symposium speaker to the podium was Massachusetts MUFON's Marge Christensen, who also serves as our National Director of Public Relations and publishes the monthly newsletter, \"P.I.P.E. Line.\" EDUCATION The abstract of Marge's speech (and the complete text of all the papers can be obtained in the published Proceedings) can be summarized as follows: \"Arguments are presented to show that if the American public were well-informed about the UFO subject, the burden of proof would lie not with UFOlogists, but rather with the U.S. Government to explain to the American people why a major world power is 'not interested' in flying objects which exhibit a propulsion system obviously in advance of our own aircraft, and which have exhibited an interest in our own nuclear weapons storage areas, according to our government's own documents.\" As most of you are aware by now, the indefatigable Mrs. Christensen is 4 WALT ANDRUS also the chief mover and main co- ordinator of the first National UFO Information Week, scheduled for August 18th through the 25th. Marge reviewed many of the public displays and information projects underway by various state MUFON organizations for that period, but since the details can be found in her own article elsewhere in this issue, I will not go into them here. Suffice it to say that all who have contributed their time and energy to this first-of-its-kind project deserve our congratulations and assistance, and none more than its prime originator, Marge Christensen. REPETITIONS George Fawcett of Lincolton, North Carolina, followed Marge with a talk on \"UFO Repetitions: A Challenge to Scientific Investigations.\" George's thesis was that certain aspects of UFO sightings have repeated themselves time and again over the past 40 years on a global scale, and that these repetitious factors present a challenge to both science and society. \"Any future solution,\" said Fawcett, \"to the growing worldwide UFO enigma will have to deal directly with these UFO repetitions.\" George, MUFON State Director for North Carolina, is a tireless investigator of UFOs who has personally looked into over a thousand reports and authored more than a hundred articles about the subject in various newspapers and magazines. He has also managed to amass a considerable body of UFO ephemera, including the numerous clippings and photographs displayed in- his accompanying slide show. Like many of us, George is perplexed both by the phenomenon and by the way it is perceived by various segments of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"society, including government and science. In 1984, he noted, Dr. J. Allen Hynek addressed a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science with a talk on \"The 125 Properties of the UFO Phenomenon,\" while James Oberg spoke on \"The Absence of a UFO Phenomenon.\" \"How,\" Fawcett asked, \"can something that doesn't exist have 125 properties?\" His own talk to the Symposium centered around 25 particular repeating properties of the UFO phenomenon. These included their unique disc and dome-shapes, high- speed maneuverability, the pacing of cars and airplanes, radar-tracking, falls of angel hair, increases in background radiation, physiological and psychological effects on witnesses, electromagnetic effects, physical landing traces, contacts with alleged entities, periodic increases in the number of sightings reported, associated power failures, and so on. \"The unexplained UFO residue is not just a matter of feelings and general impressions as some would have us believe,\" concluded Fawcett, \"but represents a genuine, growing, global problem, yet to be solved. We have learned a great deal from UFO repetitions already, but I also feel there is a great deal more to be learned.\" FATAL ENCOUNTER One of the repeated character- istics of the phenomenon, of course, is the recurring stories of crashed saucers and retrieved alien bodies. And one of the more well-known researchers of this specialized category has been, and is, Leonard Stringfield of Cincinatti, Ohio, the author of \"Inside Saucer Post, 3-0 Blue,\" \"Situation Red: The UFO Siege,\" and several monologues on alleged crash/retrievals. The topic of Leonard's talk before this Symposium was \"The Fatal Encounter at Ft. Dix- McGuire: A Case Study; Status Report IV.\" On September 23, 1980, said Stringfield, he received the first of what would be an interrupted series of communications with one \"Jeffrey Morse,\" who claimed to be a military policeman on patrol at McGuire AFB, GEORGE FAWCETT New Jersey, adjoining Fort Dix, the night of January 18, 1978. As relayed by Morse, there was considerable UFO activity in the area that night, he alone having seen up to 12 individual, greenish-blue lights flying in various stages of formation. Reportedly, one of these lights came near the car of a Fort Dix MP who was engaged in active pursuit, interferring with the officer's radio transmission. At that time, according to Morse, a four-foot tall \"thing\" with grayish-brown skin and fat head appeared in front of his car. The officer fired five times at the thing with a .45, and once overhead at the object hovering in the sky, which then rose straight up and away, joining with 11 other objects. The humanoid ran across the ground and disappeared into some woods, apparently climbing a fence around McGuire and collapsing on the end of an old runway. The area was then cordoned off by MPs, including Morse, who were not themselves allowed any closer. A special group of \"blue berets\" then arrived on the scene and were placed in charge of the fallen body Morse'said he could see no more than 50 feet away. The body was sprayed with something, placed on a platform, and then a wooden crate built around it in place. It was then put in a metal container and forklifted aboard an air force C-141 bound for Wright-Patterson. A couple of days afterwards, Morse and other MPs on duty that night were sent to W P and interrogated about what they had seen and how much they might know. Morse said he signed a document swearing secrecy about the event. After his first contact with Stringfield, he said he had reason to believe his mail was being intercepted, his telephone tapped, and perhaps even personal surveillance maintained. Stringfield has since continued investigating the case, constrained by Morse's situation (at one time his civilian job appeared threatened) and the usual disappointments of trying to obtain various documents and reports through the Freedom of Information Act. The air force replied that after a five-year waiting period, MP reports are routinely destroyed, the one in question having been scheduled for destruction in January of 1984. Through Morse Stringfield obtained a copy of an \"Incident/Complaint Report,\" form (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"PETER GERSTEN SYMPOSIUM, Continued 1569, which mentioned \"that an unidentified body had been shot,\" but without official confirmation of same by the air force, the report remains in limbo, somewhere between evidence of a stupendous encounter or a clever hoax. LEGAL PROOF New York attorney and chief counsel for CAUS (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy) Peter Gersten, as he did at the M.I.T. MUFON Symposium, addressed the issue of the burden of UFO proof from the viewpoint of a practicing criminal lawyer. \"There is already enough evidence in the form of thousands of reports, hundreds of still and moving pictures, and countless government documents to adduce the existence of UFOs,\" Gersten argued. \"The case has already been proved. But not in court. In September, in Houston, Gersten will carry the $20 million personal injury suit of the Cash- Landrum case into U.S. District Court, but admits the chances of his winning are \"slim and none.\" MEDICAL EVIDENCE MUFON Deputy Director John Schuessler of Houston, followed Gersten with a summary of physical effects cases, and especially those found in the Cash-Landrum case, of which Schuessler was the chief investigator. Said medical effects range from anorexia, cancer, hair and fingernail loss to diarrhea, vomiting and other serious disabilities. Schuessler then offered his own prescription for how future cases involving human injury should be handled and investigated. The first thing is to approach the problem with a positive attitude, and not waste time and energy in negatives. The investigator should have a warm personal regard for the victim, and work closely with competent medical consultants. All relevant information should be collected and detailed records of meetings and interviews kept; photographs should be taken. \"Strive for co-operation with responsible individuals and groups,\" Schuessler advised, \" but do not hesitate to ignore anyone that does not demonstrate ethical behavior. Do not bow to pressure to do anything other than find the truth. Re-visit the case from time to time. Don't just get the report and then forget about the well- being of the victim. Most victims will need some support for months and even years after the event. This is a big responsibility to be shouldered by any investigator. Finally, share the results of your work, so other victims may JOHN SCHUESSLER"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"benefit.\" PHYSICAL TRACES Another excellently illustrated slide show was presented by Ted Phillips on the subject of \"Physical Trace Landing Reports: The Case For UFOs.\" Phillips, of Reed Springs, Missouri, is also a member of CUFOS and CAUS, and over the years has put together a landing case catalog of some 2,677 reports from 64 countries. \"I feel such cases represent one of the most direct approaches to resolving the UFO mystery,\" Phillips said. \"Traces remain as visible evidence long after the reported event. And if UFOs are not available for study in the laboratory, their physical traces certainly are.\" Phillips then summarized five cases which he admitted were \"not well known, not taken from the latest reports, and are perhaps even among the more controversial. They were chosen because they push us to the edge of what we can or should believe.\" Space hardly permits a review of the cases here, but interested parties are strongly urged to consult Phillips' paper in the published Proceedings, or the video-taping of same. Details of how these can be ordered will be found elsewhere in this issue of the Journal. CRASHED SAUCERS After an evening dinner break, the always engaging William Moore of Burbank, California, regaled the assembled audience with a talk based on two . full-length papers in the Proceedings, \"Crashed Saucers: Evidence in Search of Proof,\" and \"The Roswell Incident.\" Combined, they cover 50 of 180 published pages, and are well worth the price of admission alone. Moore contrasted a legendary (and apparently fictitious) crashed saucer report which appeared in Frank Scully's \"Behind the Flying Saucers\" with a similar report coming out of Roswell, New Mexico, which he and Stanton Friedman have investigated extensively. Briefly, the former tale can be traced to the handiwork of a convicted con man known as Silas M. Newton, and his equally shady cohort, TED PHILLIPS the \"mysterious Dr. Gee,\" who turned out to be, Moore is convinced, one Leo A. GeBauer. Apparently the idea grew out of Newton's oil leases, GeBauer's self-taught electrical knowledge, and an aborted Hollywood publicity campaign for a grade B science-fiction movie known simply as \"The Flying Saucer,\" which was touted as having real footage of a captured flying saucer. GeBauer had developed a dubious device known as a \"doodlebug,\" which was supposed to detect fluctuations in the earth's magnetic field and thereby signal the presence of oil, gas and other mineral deposits. Newton's somewhat imbalanced genius derived the idea of heralding the doodlebug as captured saucer technology. Scully, Moore believed, was an unwitting dupe in the scheme. More importantly, Moore added, the incident reveals how an official FBI document relating to the alleged crashed landing, after a diligent investigation, can be traced back to its fraudulent source in Newton's active imagination. In contrast, the Roswell Incident continues to hold up under scrutiny, according to Moore and Friedman. NOISY NEGATIVISTS Friedman added a few more details to the Roswell roster in his keynote speech, \"Flying Saucers, Noisy Negativists and Truth,\" a liberal broadside at Carl Sagan, Philip Klass and other vocal skeptics who, Friedman charged, often resort to outright (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"STANTON T. FRIEDMAN Symposium, Continued distortion of the available evidence. Those who have never had the pleasure of hearing Stanton in person should treat themselves and others to the videotape of his talk. The complete text, of course, can be found in the printed Proceedings. Following Friedman's present- ation, all the speakers were called to the front table to form a panel and respond to questions moderated by MC John Schroeder from the floor. Sunday morning attendees could sign up for a \"Breakfast With the Speakers,\" which involved a full breakfast buffet and seating with the speaker of your choice, another innovative twist, among several, grafted on the standard Symposium fare by the Greater St. Louis host group, and for 8 which they are to be recommended. Only one speaker failed to make the morning call. Following breakfast, the annual corporate meeting was held as reported elsewhere. HYPNOSIS The afternoon session opened with David Webb's \"The Influence of Hypnosis in the Investigation of Abduction Cases.\" Webb, a senior scientist specializing in solar physics, selected a large sampling of abduction cases to test the hypothesis that hypnosis itself is somehow fundamental to the UFO abduction phenomenon. What he discovered might surprise some. \"In forty per cent of the abduction reports in my sample,\" said Webb, \"I found the use of hypnosis was not important in gaining information about the alleged 'on-board' portion of the experience. In one-third of the reports, hypnosis was not used at all during the investigation.\" Webb concluded: \"Investigators of abduction reports know that the core experience has consistent, recurring elements irrespective of how the information is retrieved. Such cases may represent the key to the UFO mystery. Significant advances in our understanding will occur only when we greatly increase the number of reports investigated and more effectively pool our analytical resources in their analysis. The solution may be within our grasp.\" ABDUCTION EVIDENCE Abduction reports themselves were the subject of New York artist Budd Hopkins' speech. Hopkins is the author of \"Missing Time,\" and is presently working on another book, \"The Haunting of Kitley Woods - An Ongoing UFO Saga,\" which he previewed at last year's MUFON Symposium in San Antonio. \"The subject of UFO abduction reports,\" Hopkins said, \"is approached as if these kidnappings were crimes, and I were an investigator trying to assemble sufficient evidence for a 'grand jury' to decide that such events did, in fact, happen as the abductees claim. \"First, an attempt is made to refute the two theories that claim no kidnappings occurred — that the witnesses are either lying or are somehow deluded. Next, the various classes of evidence are presented to support the physical reality of these kidnappings. These are 1), secondary witnesses to the abductions; 2), physical traces - landing marks on the ground, wounds and marks upon the abductees' bodies; and 3), the congruity of description by the abductees. \"Finally a motive for the 'crime' is presented: a longterm research project upon, and active interaction (including genetic or reproductive experiment- ation) with human beings by their kidnappers, whom I identify finally as extraterrestrial in origin.

The meeting was called to order at 10:30 a.m. by Walter H. Andrus Jr., International Director with John F. Schuessler, Deputy Director for Administration, acting as Secretary. CENTRAL DIRECTOR The UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis was commended for their well organized and implemented part in hosting the Symposium. The first order of business was to elect a new Central Regional Director to replace Charles L. Tucker whose term had expired on the Board of Directors. Since only one nomination was received, a mail ballot was not required this year. Dan L. Wright, state director from Michigan,. was approved and elected by the members present from the twenty central states. The 1986 MUFON Symposium will be held at Michigan State University in East Lansing on June 27, 28 & 29,1986 and will be science-oriented (further details in Director's Message). FRENCH REPORT It was announced that Dr. Hynek, Dr. Vallee and Dr. Niemtzow had recently flown to France to evaluate the work of GEPAN and to make recommendations upon future funding for UFO investigations and research by the French Government. They also met privately with Claude Poher former Chief of GEPAN (see separate article in this issue concerning their visit as related by Richard Niemtzow, M.D. upon his return). Ron Lakis was introduced, with credit given for his UFO documentary \"The UFO Experience\" (see Director's Message for details on how to purchase 12 the film and the conditions for its use). The film \"UFOs: What's Going On?\", being produced and directed by Fred Rosen for H.B.O. Cable TV distribution was announced with a tentative release date of August 1985. Regional and State Directors made their annual reports. Typed copies were submitted in full to the International Director. Brief statements were made by each of the annual meeting audience. Oral reports were made by Paul Cerny (State Director for Northern California and Western Regional Director), Henry H. McKay (Ontario Provincial Director and Candian Regional Director), Joe Santangelo (Eastern Regional Director and MUFON Amateur Radio Net), Dan Wright (State Director for Michigan and Central Regional Director), Forrest Lundberg (Iowa), Leonard Sturm (Illinois), Marge Christensen (Massachusetts), Mildred Biesle (Utah), Steve Toth (Ohio), Ken McLean (Wyoming), Jean Waller (Oklahoma), Michael Brein (Hawaii), Donald Ware (Florida), Donald Schmitt (Wisconsin), Doug Labat (Louisiana), Bruce A. Widaman (Missouri), and Paul Norman (Victoria, Australia). FIELD EXAM Thomas H. Nicholl, Deputy Director for Business Management, was introduced as well as the Assistant State Directors attending the corporate meeting. Dan Wright presented the final version of the Field Investigator's Exam for acceptance by the organization, which was subsequently approved. The exam will be first given to all State Directors, State Section Directors and Field Investigators during the next six months so that all will be familiar with and cognizant of the contents. The program will be administered initially by Mrs. Shirley Coyne in Michigan under the direction of Dan Wright and financed by MUFON. After all of the above people have taken the examination, a decision will be made as to its application' for advancement from Field Investigator Trainee to Field Investigator and who will administer the program in the future. This is a mjaor step in upgrading the professionalism of MUFON investigators and researchers. A commendation was given to Dan Wright and his committee for developing two 35mm slide sets of 50 and 100 sets for use as visual aids in giving UFO lectures. Only a limited supply is available so please place your orders with Dan Wright, 1502 Marquette, Lansing, MI 48906. The 50 slide set costs $25.00 and the 100 slide set $45.00. Marge Christensen reviewed the National UFO Information Week activities throughout the country scheduled for August 18- 25, 1985. Both she and Doug Labat discussed the UFO Library Resource Centers in various parts of the country, which is being spearheaded by David Christensen. RADIO Joe Santangelo gave a six month report on the MUFON Amateur Radio Net in which 23 different stations had checked in on Saturday mornings. Due to the \"Breakfast with the Speakers,\" concluding at 10:30 a.m. and the afternoon session starting at 12:30 p.m., it was necessary to adjourn the annual meeting at 12:30 p.m., thereby preventing sufficient time for additional new business on the agenda.

Claude Poher served as Chief of GEPAN for two years, followed by Dr. Alain Esterle, while Jean Jacques Velasco presently occupies this position of responsibility. OUTSIDE ADVICE In order to evaluate future funding for GEPAN, the Prime Minister of France sought the advice of sources independent of political and scientific personnel in France who might be prejudiced. Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Richard C. Niemtzow, M.D. were invited to meet with government officials and to make recommendations for the continuation of GEPAN. Dr. Jacques Vallee accompanied Dr. Hynek and Niemtzow as an unofficial observer to the meetings and conferences due to his interest and knowledge. The triumvirate arrived in Paris on June 23rd and had lunch with Claude Poher. Mr. Poher is still very interested in UFOs. In spite of rumors circulated a few years ago, he is \"alive and well.\" Poher advised that he will continue to be watching the progress of GEPAN from the sidelines as it faces political attacks. On Monday, June 24th a conference was held at the French National Space Center in Paris (Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales), attended by 20 to 30 space center officials and university professors. Both Dr. Hynek and Niemtzow presented papers to this prestigious conclave. Dr. Neimtzow's paper was titled \"Physiological and radiation effects from intense luminous unidentified flying objects\" and Dr. Hynek's was \"An approach to the study of unidentified aerospace phenom- enon.\" Hynek discussed his computerized UFO catalog and firmly advised that he supported the activity and efforts of GEPAN and recommended that it not be closed down. Hynek and Niemtzow offered the cooperation of UFO organizations in the U.S.A. to GEPAN and encouraged international collaboration on exceptional UFO cases in either country. If a significant case occurred in France, Dr. Hynek and Niemtzow would be invited to participate and likewise GEPAN personnel would come to the United States. Unofficially, Jacques Vallee was present as an observer to offer his support to GEPAN and recommend its continuance. Dr. Niemtzow, who speaks French fluently having attended medical school in France, had two private conversations with top officials of the French space program. Mr. Lions, Director of the National Space Center, felt that GEPAN should continue to be active in spite of political and scientific problems. Mr. J. Gruau, Inspector General of the Space Center and Secretary to the GEPAN Scientific Council also supported the research work of GEPAN. SPACE CENTER The National Space Center Headquarters and offices of GEPAN in Toulouse, France was the site for the meetings on June 25th. Mr. P. Bescond, Under Director of the Space Center at Toulouse welcomed the U.S. Consultants to the seminar/ symposium-style all-day meeting. Dr. Jacques Vallee presented a paper titled \"Applications of methods of artificial intelligence for the screening of witness reports.\" This is a method of determining by telephone, using computer displayed questions, whether a case should be investigated further. All three Consultants recommended that GEPAN should continue in the future due to the wide collection of material that would otherwise be wasted. They also met Dr. Alain Esterle former Chief of GEPAN who is now involved in evaluation of space programs. Dr. Esterle obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Washington and while Chief of GEPAN, he met with MUFON officers in Houston, Texas. FILE ACCESS On Wednesday, June 26th, Hynek and Niemtzow had the pleasure of personal access to the GEPAN UFO file and computerized file. The found no evidence of humanoids or UFO crashes or any type of aggressive sightings such as radar or aircraft. All cases were very well investigated. They expressed their desire to continue working with GEPAN and Jean Jacques Velasco, the Chief. In the Paris meeting on June 24, a representative of the Prime Minister was in the audience to observe and report back to his superior. NO PRESS For the record, Richard C. Niemtzow, M.D. was invited as a private citizen and a Consultant to the GEPAN meetings by the French Government. In reality, Dr. Niemtzow is a Major in the U.S.A.F. Medical Corp stationed at Andrews AFB, Maryland. He has a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences. Richard has been a MUFON Consultant in Radiation since 197.7, and is presently the State Section Director for Prince Georges-County in Mayland. The U.S.A.F. approved of Dr. Niemtzow's visit to France, but he was forbidden to participate in any JDress conference due to the sensitive nature of his position. We are indebted to Dr. Niemtzow for providing this information to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL by telephone.

By publication, the production group engaged for not-for-profit Midwest Motion Picture Proteges, Inc., will have post-produced and will be making available, the lectures, atmosphere and excitement of the Symposium on either VMS or Beta tapes. The sale of the Symposium tapes are in two categories....individual lectures at the current cost of $27.00 or the entire Symposium (roughly 14 hours!) at the current cost of $121.0QAt the time of this writing, we've already received one order for the entire Symposium and are expecting more in the mail. The individual lectures are as follows....Peter Gersten's THE BURDEN OF PROOF, William Moore's CRASHED SAUCERS, Stanton T. Friedman's NOISY NEGATIVISTS, George Fawcett's UFO REPETITIONS, Ted Phillips' PHYSICAL TRACE LANDING REPORTS, John Schuessler's MEDICAL EVIDENCE, Budd Hopkins' ABDUCTION REPORTS, David Webb's HYPNOSIS AND ABDUCTION CASES, and Leonard Stringfield's FATAL ENCOUNTER AT FT. DIX. An equally exciting opportunity for all of us is that Midwest Films Productions, Inc., the company aiding MMPPI in its releasing efforts, is in negotiations with video clubs in the St. Louis area for working the tapes in a rental fashion for us! I've been a member of MUFON now for two years and have heard of and seen the need for both money and public education. I'm working on both. If you would like to order either an individual lecture, several individual 14 Lights, Camera, Action! lectures, or the complete Symposium set, simply write down what you want....specify VHSor Beta, make your check or money order payable to Midwest Motion Picture Proteges, Inc., and mail to MMPPI, 9327 Corregidor, St. Louis, Missouri 63134. Our phone number is (314) 423-2827 with an answer machine for placing orders also. If you call, be sure and leave your number and an appropriate time you may be reached. (DUE TO THE COMPLETENESS'OF EVENT COVERAGE AND THE FACT THAT YOUR CHECK MAY BE FROM OUT OF TOWN/STATE, PLEASE ALLOW 4 TO 6 WEEKS FOR CHECK CLEARANCE, DUBBING, AND DELIVERY.) Also, if you would like to rent the tapes, take this article to your video club and ask them to contact us. -Dennis Stacy We'll be happy to arrange a deal with them. These tapes will not only bring you up-todate, they are capable of informing those family members and friends who you wish you could explain ufology to, plus they will also raise monies for both MUFON and MMPPI.

Whether the case study in question — Leonard H. Stringfield's status update on the Fort Dix-McGuire AFB, N.J., UFO encounter/alien-body retrieval operation of January 18, 1978 — should thus be written off by the casual observer as a passe myth or as an expose slightly ahead of its time, I know not. What I do know, though, ought to serve as a new point of departure for dealing with the Dix- McGuire incident. Item: After months of exhaustive research by Stringfield, Richard Hall, and a few others, this case seems to be standing the test of time. Indeed, Hall puts it at the top of the credibility scale as regards Stringfield's assortment of UFO crash-retrieval accounts. Item: The uniqueness of the case lies in two mutually supporting pieces of evidence: (1) the testimony of one of its principals, a former McGuire security policeman, who feels it necessary not to \"go public\" with his name until he's assured of a safe forum for his story (such as a Congressional committee hearing?); (2) a \"leaked\" document confirming the basic facts of his story — the document being an \"Incident Report\" filed by McGuire Security Police and forwarded to the USAF Office of Special Investigations (O.S.O.) for coordination of any follow- up reports. DATA QUEST It's those follow-up reports that can help resolve any question about the case's authenticity, comparative importance, and outcome. Where do the reports repose now? What agencies have had custody over them during the past seven years, and why? How can we get Congress to launch an inquiry into the events and documentation surrounding the incident? Finding the answers will of course require additional time and effort on the part of us all, the only reward being Truth. Where to start? Writing to your representatives and senators in Congress might help. In your letter, enclose a copy of the Incident Report (reproduced on pages 60-61 in the St. Louis MUFON Symposium Proceed- ings) and ask the Congress member to send it to the appropriate House/Senate committee for their review and investigation. About 30 days after your member thus responds to this request, write direct to the committee chairman to determine what his committee is doing, or plans to do, to resolve the issue. His answer ought to prove useful in preparing 1 a letter-to- the-editor or Op-ED Page item for your local newspaper. (Once the news media begin to sink their teeth into this case, the snowball should start rolling on its own.) While you thus perform your civic duty on the stage of public opinion, you should know that back in the wings Richard Hall and others are trying to track down the current location of the several principals cited in the preliminary Incident Report (whose names are deleted from the published copy of the report so as to protect them from the same kind of reprisal allegedly incurred by Stringfield's informant). NEW CAMPAIGN Aside from the approach to Congress, we have another, high- visibility avenue to the Truth: the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Accordingly, a group of researchers in the Washington, D.C., area has embarked on the FOIA pursuit of all records pertaining to the O.S.I, involvement in the incident's reportage and aftermath: such records as the autopsy report on the \"one body of unknown origin\" (the terminology entered on the DD Form 1569 Incident Report), the intelligence-analysis report on the body's personal effects, the various witness statements, and the audio/video/polygraph transcripts of all interrogation sessions with the incident's participants and witnesses. In the coming months of expected USAF stonewalling on the group's pursuit, they'll be mapping out the long- term strategy. This will entail the services of an attorney for filing the appropriate lawsuit, the preparation of interrogatories for the court to grant a \"discovery motion\" toward determining the exact nature and whereabouts of the sought-for records, and any necessary issuing of the subpoenas to both participants in and witnesses to the incident, in an effort to show that an event of this magnitude must have generated a permanently maintained file of records. Of course, such an undertaking will incur substantial expense. But it also offers you a chance to put your UFO-research contributions toward a history-making pay-off. Here's the proposal: send whatever you can, right now, to the Fund for UFO Research, Inc (P.O. Box 277, Mount Rainier, MD 20712). On the tax-deductible check/money order, note your desire that the donation be applied to the \"Dix-McGuire FOIA UFO Litigation Project.\" The monies thus received will be kept separate from the Fund's other resources, expressly to wage this battle for the release of all official information on New Jersey's ultimate UFO encounter. Note: any left-over project funds will be transferred to the Fund's general operating account. As the suite moves forward in the courts, check the pages of the MUFON UFO Journal for periodic status reports. Remember: the success of this project depends on your personal (continued on page 16) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Meier Case, an Apology LETTERS By the Readers Dear Editor, The recent article (June 1985) by Philip Mantle reminds us that if we should happen to observe or confront any ET technology, we would judge it to be possessed of magical powers. It is worth emphasizing that, as a corollary, what they could do should violate or circumvent many of our present laws of physics, probably much more than what we can do now would violate the laws of nature as understood by scientists of 500 years ago. In short, their technology should seem beyond the.range of ordinary knowledge, or occult, according to the dictionary meaning. As Mantle infers, this should include the high technology that would permit easy travel between star systems. A related point coming up frequently now in recent scientific literature on this topic is that our galaxy should be \"saturated\" with ET races, due to their past colonization and migration, if not due also to their independent earlier starts of life on millions of suitable planets. The fact that scientists have not spotted any official evidence of them is now taken to mean that they have a sort of embargo or quarantine against us, until we reach a level of understanding where we could accept their presence without launching nuclear warheads or going into panic or feeling that our religious values are threatened. From this it follows that such ETs, for the most part, must be benevolent in a hands-off way, especially since we otherwise would not exist apparently unexploited by them today. The embargo idea, described for example in The Planetary Report (Vol. V, No. 1, 1985, p.20), further implies that they are observing us, if only to determine when it will be time for the embargo to be lifted. However, any abrupt lifting of the embargo would probably have disastrous results at present. Perhaps UFOs are one way in 16 which we are being prepared gradually to accept the nearby presence of diverse ET civilizations far superior to ours, but being prepared in a manner designed not to alert scientists and governments, so that the \"official\" embargo can hold for a while longer. If so, it is possible that they may have contacted a few individuals in a similar manner, so as not to catch the attention of scientists, in order to explain more fully what may be going on, and to get their messages into our literature. Putting all of this together, the E. Meier case seems to be a good condidate for one such definitive contact. This is the case briefly described in the book reviewed favorably by L. Parish (July-Aug., 1984). Although the case had previously been mostly dismissed partly because Meier's huge numbers of color photos of posing saucer craft look too good, it is mainly because the very lengthy, ET message accompany- ing his contact sessions seems occult in many respects. From the foregoing discussion, however, this is more a point in favor than against, provided the accompanying physical evidence is very firm. I know of none of his several hundred UFO photos that have been found fraudulent. Claims to the contrary by Ground Saucer Watch around 1980 seem unsupportable by the evidence, and seem forced by the opinions of its director who, in Flying Saucer Review (Vol. 30, No. 5, 1985) wrote, \"Simply stated, the few bona fide 'saucers' actually observed during the last forty years represent clandestine government technology testing, which we can support with technical reports and photos.\" It should also be pointed out that no hoaxist has been uncovered, after the ten years since the Meier affair began, and the names of at least 28 witnesses to secondary events in the case are known. James W. Deardorff, Ph.D. Dear Editor, In the May 1985 issue of the Journal, I made a sarcastic joke at Robert Sheaffer's expense. I wish to apologize to Mr. Sheaffer and to all who seek to make this subject respectable. Young ufologists, take heed of my error: Moral character is not earned at the expense of another. Please remember Dr. Hynek's maxim: Ridicule is not a part of the scientific method and people should not be taught that it is!

Likewise, the solution to the UFO enigma could very well launch mankind into new discoveries of technology, medicine, communications, and an infinite amount of other areas. All of this could result in a quantum leap forward for the human race. Please do your part to support National UFO Information Week. SYMPOSIUM, Continued prosecution will rest its case.\" Hopkins also conducted an impromptu afternoon workshop on how to investigate UFO incidents in general, and clues that might indicate an abduction had taken place in particular. These latter often include a disjointed, or chopped-up, account of events that might indicate a period of missing time. All in all, the Symposium was a resounding success, due both to the speakers, and their well-illustrated presentations, and the foresight and warm hospitality of the host Greater St. Louis MUFON group. For the first time, the entire proceedings were videotaped, attendees had an opportunity to breakfast with their favorite speakers, and T-shirts and BUDD HOPKINS bookbags emblazoned with the MUFON logo were offered (or sale.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant SEPTEMBER 1985 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): The two giant planets of the solar system can be seen at the same time during twilight. Jupiter, still retrograding westward in Capricornus, glows brilliantly in the SE while fainter Saturn in Libra shines in the SW. The latter sets about 9:30 PM Daylight Time in midmonth. Jupiter is due south at 10 PM. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): The brightest planet Venus rises north of east about 3:45 AM in midmonth, followed by the much dimmer red planet Mars an hour later in the same direction. Venus appears 5° south of the crescent moon on the 12th; the planet and the star Regulus make a close pair on the 21st. Jupiter sets in the WSW at about 2:30 AM in midmonth. It is 4° north of the gibbous moon at 2 AM on the 24th. Halley's Comet: \"The Comet\" is now within range of backyard astronomers with 6-to-8-inch telescopes. In midnorthern latitudes the dim object rises about 12:30 AM Daylight Time in midmonth north of east between the stars 68 and 71 Orionis (exact position on the 15th is R.A. 6h 13m, Dec. +19° 37 [1950 coordinates]).

The fall season's celestial symbol, the Great Square of Pegasus, is easily visible in the east while the summer symbol, the Summer Triangle, stands high in the west. Three bright stars near the horizon create frequent false UFO reports at this time of the year.

State Section Directors present were Kerry Dean Teverbaugh (Vigo and Clay Counties), Francis L. Ridge (Posey, Vanderburgh and Gibson Counties), James C. DeLotel (Clark, Floyd and Harrison Counties), and Jerry L. Sievers (Knox, Daviess and Sullivan Counties). Kerry Dean Teverbaugh, meteorologist for WTWO-TV in Terre Haute, served as master of ceremonies. Mr. Sievers handled the business meeting in which he discussed the proposed newsletter for Indiana MUFON, organizational plans, and National UFO Information Week. Michael B. White, State Section Director for Monroe and Brown Counties, has produced a short, professionally-done UFO documentary for Channel 4 WTTV in Bloomington, depicting sightings at an area known as Lucky Point (south of Monroe City along the White River), including interviews with witnesses and investigators. In a two-part article in The Saturday Evening Post magazine (March 1984), Donald W. White related some of these incidents in his article titled \"Flying Saucers: Are They Us?\" After the meeting was adjourned Saturday evening, four carloads of people drove to Lucky Point for a short skywatch. Walt Andrus gave a short presentation on the objectives of the Mutual UFO Network, the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual and displayed the current MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings, specifically for those attending who were not familiar with MUFON.

Dr. Jacobs comments on the increasing number of UFO abduction reports, saying the abductees' stories are believable for a number of reasons. An article in the ENQUIRER'S May 28 issue quotes Brad Steiger and Hayden Hewes as saying that Bigfoot creatures are lower- life forms which have been brought here by UFO occupants from other planets. The pilot of an Iberia Airlines jetliner says he was ordered to change course to investigate a brilliant UFO seen over the Canary Islands, according to a report in the July 2 issue of ENQUIRER. Those who have read Zecharia Sitchin's two previous books, THE 12TH PLANET and THE STAIR- WAY TO HEAVEN, will certainly want to obtain his newest title, THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN. In the previous books, Sitchin cited ancient Sumerian and Biblical references to support his theory that the human race was \"created\" by extraterrestrials. In THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN, he continues his central theme, amplifying his previous conclusions with new evidence from his research. There is a 15-page listing of references in this book, so one can see that Sitchin has done his homework before setting out his controversial theories. I personally regard all three books as \"must\" reading and look forward to many more volumes in the \"Earth Chronicles\" series of books. Copies of the three books may be obtained from Avon Books (1790 Broadway - New York, NY 10019) in paperback editions. THE 12TH PLANET is $4.50; the two later books are $3.95 each. Richard Michael Rasmussen's THE UFO LITERATURE is the latest annotated bibliography of English- language books dealing with the UFO subject. Rasmussen includes chapters on \"The Nature of the Literature\" and \"UFOs in Literature: A Brief History.\" While not a complete listing of all published works (as is the case with all such bibliographies, it seems), this compilation does include some titles which are little-known. Overall, however, one can question the need for yet another reference work of this sort. Another drawback is the price ($29.95) for a 263-page hardcover, even though it is nicely done. If you want to add THE UFO LITERATURE to your UFO literature, the publisher is McFarland & Company, Inc. - Box 611 - Jefferson, NC 28640. MESSAGE, Continued In the March 1985 issue of the Journal, a new magazine titled THE UNKNOWN was announced with Jon Violette and Stan Mussman as Co- Editors. The original investors in this project have decided not to continue because of a lack of committment from advertisers. This has necessitated a reorganization, as well as exploring some alternative approaches to marketing. However, it does not look like THE UNKNOWN will debut on the newsstands this year according to Jon Violette. Ron Lakis, Producer of the KPIX- TV UFO documentary, \"The UFO Experience\" has purchased the syndication rights for this film, and is making copies available for purchase by individuals for personal use. The film may not be aired on TV stations unless the station enters into an agreement with Mr. Lakis in regard to payment of royalties. Lakis hopes to sell 250 copies of the film in order to fund the cost of a second documentary on the UFO subject. Tapes may be purchased for $39.95 plus shipping from: STARRION PRODUCTIONS, P.O.
