In Phoenix, it was \"deja vue all over again!\" Tele- phones of local press and TV stations began ringing off the hook as numerous witnesses reported bright lights hovering in the sky south of Phoenix. Just as happened about a year be- fore, extremely bright orange- colored lights were appear- ing, hovering apparently mo- tionless, and then disappear- ing over the range of moun- tains named after the stars, the Estrellas. Could it be that ETs were back to once again stick the UFO needle into a reluc- tant public? Or were these lights merely flares dropped by the Air Force or National Guard during a training session more than 60 miles from Phoenix? Witnesses said it couldn't be flares. The lights were too bright to be that far away, they were the wrong color (orange instead of white), they didn't drop down- ward, and they could see no parachutes (that support burning flares) and no smoke plumes. Also, they didn't see or hear any airplanes that could have dropped the flares. These looked like the lights seen during March of the previous year, which they believed were only about 15 to 20 miles southwest of Phoenix. Reports by the media The news media dutifully reported the sightings and possible explanations, and then once again the UFO subject faded from public view. But within the com- munity of witnesses and UFO researchers an argument was raging. Were these lights explainable, or weren't they? A long article in the Phoenix New Times weekly newspaper for March 5, 1998, discussed the sightings of March 13, 1997, and the reaction to them. The article, by Tony Ortega, made a mockery of the witnesses and UFO researchers for not accept- ing the proffered explanations, and was critical of the Air Force for adding to the confusion by not stating immediately, when asked, that the Maryland National Guard had dropped flares over the Barry Goldwater training range at the time of the March, 1997, sightings. The article argued that all the sightings could be ex- plained. The witnesses, however, were not convinced. What was the truth? That is what they wanted to know. About the author Dr. Maccabee holds the Ph.D. in Physics, and is a research physicist at the Naval Surface Weap- ons Center in Silver Springs, MD. He is a former member of NICAP, and was one of the founders of the Fund For UFO Research (FUFOR). He has written nearly 100 articles in publications such as the Journal, and co-authored the book UFOs Are Real: Here's the Proof with Ed Walters. As far as the general public and the news me- dia are concerned, this all began on March 13, 1997, when numerous witnesses saw, and one person video- taped, a moving V-shaped array of lights that traveled southward over the Phoenix area somewhat after 8 p.m. Some witnesses also reported a large dark triangular object that blocked out the stars as it passed over. Then, about two hours later, some witnesses saw— and several videotaped—an array of lights which ap- peared one after another in the sky south of Phoenix. The individual bright lights in the array would appear for a minute to several minutes and then fade and go out. The March 13 sightings have been featured in numerous press accounts and TV documentaries and in two issues of the MUFON UFO Journal. The first MUFON report was written by Bill Hamilton and pub- lished in May, 1997 (Issue 349). In that paper Hamilton discussed his own sighting as well as the sightings by others during the 10 p.m. event. Hamilton also reported on sightings that began about 8 p.m. and continued for about half an hour or so with the first witnesses near Paulden, AZ, and the last witnesses somewhat south of the Phoenix area and north of Tucson. Hamilton identified four different events: 1)8- 9 p.m. time frame: the moving, silent V-shaped array of lights; 2) 8-9 p.m. time frame: a large, black, silent, moving, triangular object; 3) 10 p.m.: numerous very bright glowing orange orbs that formed an arc-shaped array in the sky south of Phoenix; and 4) 8-10 p.m.: two orange lights in the sky apparently near Luke AFB (west of Phoenix) reported only by truck driver Bill Greiner, who watched them for about two hours as he drove southward. There was also a report by witnesses traveling northward from Tucson of an object which seemed to travel with them a short distance, suggest- ing that perhaps the triangle, when just north of Tuc- son, had reversed direction and headed back toward Phoenix sometime after 9 p.m. Some confusion Inevitably the moving triangle and light array events got somewhat mixed up as Hamilton conjec- tured that \"This object returned (to the Phoenix South Mountain area) at close to 10 p.m. that night and de-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 February 1999 MUFON UFO Journal ployed 'orbs' in the vicinity of the Estrella Mountain, or appeared as an object in a wide configuration that, from a distance of 25 miles, had the appearance of an arc often lights spanning a mile across.\" Hamilton further stated that \"some mysterious military source suggested that the strange lights over Phoenix were explained as an anti-aircraft experiment in a military operating area over 50 miles from Phoe- nix. This experiment involved flares descending on parachutes.\" However, \"two witnesses we interviewed were demolition experts for the military, and they stated that what they saw were not flares.\" The immediate response of the Air Force to press inquiries at Luke AFB in Phoenix and Davis-Monthan AFB near Tuc- son was that the Air Force had no flare-related opera- tions at the time. Begins with a bang Thus the story of the Phoenix lights began with a bang. No one could deny that the witnesses had seen something...the videos were proof, even if the tes- timony were disputed. The controversy raged for months, and even became politicized as a city council- woman, Emma Barwood, raised the question, why isn't the government interested in clearing up the confusion over these lights? Many months later, in late July, the Maryland National Guard announced that it had carried out train- ing maneuvers over the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range on the night of March 13, which included drop- ping high intensity flares at relatively high altitudes around 15,000 ft. These flares are used for illuminat- ing the ground. The Goldwater Range covers a large area situated from about 50 to well over 100 miles southwest of Phoenix. A earlier conclusion Even before the Maryland National Guard an- nouncement, Richard Motzer, MUFON field investi- gator for Arizona, had reached a conclusion about the light arrays. He published the results of his investiga- tion in the July, 1997, issue of {he MUFON UFO Jour- nal (#351). His article amplified on Hamilton's and gave his explanation for the 10 p.m. sightings and vid- eos: illumination flares dropped at high altitude by aircraft southwest of the Estrella Range. Motzer pointed out that, in contrast to the numerous reports of Hamilton's event #1 (8-8:30 p.m.), there were few re- ports of the orange glowing lights in event #3 (10p.m.). Further, most of those reports in event #3 came from people who lived at considerable altitudes above the level of Phoenix, who therefore could see over the mountains better than the residents at the level of the main city. These relatively few reports attracted most of the news media interest because several of the wit- nesses had videotaped the 10 p.m. lights. As is typical of the news media (media in, garble out), the 10 p.m. videos of the stationary lights were mixed up with the verbal descriptions (and one video) of the moving V- shaped array in event 1. The result was that a person watching the TV shows would be confused as to what was actually seen during the 8-8:30 p.m. sightings. (Note: the one video of the V was of short duration and didn't show much detail.) A triangulation Motzer used the sighting directions from the various locations of the witnesses to triangulate the glowing orbs. The map he published shows the sight- ing lines from six different witnesses converging on a point about 22 miles southwest of the point where In- terstate 17 crosses Interstate 10 in Phoenix. Several of the witnesses had stated their opinions that the lights were on the north side of the Estrellas, just south of Phoenix. However, Motzer's triangulation clearly showed that the lights were a few miles south of the Estrella Range. On the other hand, his triangulated location was not far enough southwestward to place the lights over the Barry Goldwater Air Force Training Range. Thus it appeared that either the National Guard had actually dropped the flares over an area roughly 30 miles north- east of the Range or else Motzer's triangulation was not accurate. But if Motzer's triangulation was not accurate, then it did not prove the lights were south of the Estrellas. Along with with his triangulation, Motzer listed about a dozen reasons why the flare theory seemed valid, certainly not the least of which is the fact that the National Guard claimed to have dropped flares during the time period of the sighting and in the gen- eral direction of the lights sighted at 10 p.m.. He ended his report by stating that the event #1 and #2 sightings had not yet been explained. (He made no comment on truck driver Bill Greiner's sighting.) Like most people in MUFON, I had heard the news media accounts and read the MUFON articles and was confused. Could all those people have been wrong? If the lights were flares over the Goldwater Range more than 50 miles from Phoenix, why were they so bright? Why did the arrangements seem so geometric, and why didn't they drop downward? The repeat flap These were all questions in my mind when I heard of the repeat \"flap\" of sightings that took place on Jan. 14, 1998. Once again the public was being asked to believe that large arrays of bright orange lights were only flares dropped by the military over an area far from Phoenix. Although I wondered about all this, no one had sent me videos to study, so I did nothing to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1999 PageS FIGURE 1 LINEAR ARRAY OF LIGHTS VIDEOTAPED BY MIKE KRZYSTON, JANUARY 14, 1998 (This is a negative image: lights are dark spots.)

(The peak is above the skyline and above the arrow.) answer my own questions until early April when one of the witnesses asked me to analyze her photos and videos of the Phoenix sightings. I received a phone call from a lady herein re- ferred to as \"L\" (who wishes anonymity). She told me that she had video of the March 13, 1997, and Jan. 14, 1998, events as well as photos and videos of numer- ous other sightings spanning a three-year period (1995- 1998), sightings which she had never made public. She wanted an independent evaluation of her photo and video evidence before she made a decision as to whether or not to make her sightings public. It was clear to me that she didn't accept the flare explana- tion, although she was (quite properly) hesitant to re- ject it without convincing proof that the lights couldn't have been flares. Another sighting She also told me of a nighttime sighting she. and her husband had in February, 1995, of three ap- parently spherical orange lights which were hovering in a triangular arrangement (one above two that were side by side). They were below her, but above the ground less than 1,500 feet away (her house is on the side of a hill; she was looking downward). Her hus- band called her attention to the lights, and after look- ing at them for a short time, she decided to photo- graph them. By the time she returned to the porch where she had an unobstructed view the upper one had gone out. She was able to take photographs of the two lower lights before they disappeared. This event has some very interesting photographic information re- lated to the time duration of the sighting. They are still under analysis. Over the following weeks and months I re- ceived from her and other witnesses copies of video- tapes and supplementary information which allowed me to triangulate the lights; that is, to locate their posi- tions relative to the witnesses with a good degree of accuracy. The videos I used were from L, Mike Krzyston (K), Chuck Rairdon (R) and witnesses (P) who desire anonymity. I decided to begin my analysis with the Jan. 14, 1998, videos because (a) there is no doubt that they videotaped the same light arrays, so triangulation of each individual light in each array would be pos- sible, (b) each of these videos has nearby geographic features visible at night that can be used as reference points for measuring directions, and (c) the spacing between the witnesses was quite large, so the triangu- lation would be accurate. Slightly tilted line of lights One particular array of lights that appears in all videos was a slightly tilted line of unevenly spaced lights. Figure 1 shows this array as it appears in the K video.

The images in any one of the videos was a straight line to within the accu- racy set by the sizes of the light images themselves. This immediately raised a question: could the Air Force drop flares in a perfectly straight line? The answer is: not intentionally, since flares are ejected from planes at some speed, and they fall downward and then drift, once the supporting parachute opens. Then the ques- tion became: what were these lights? Could they be UFOs? Making the calculations The results of the calibrations of the video cam- eras and the subsequent triangulation are shown in Fig- ure 2 The positions of the witnesses are indicated on the map, along with some of the sighting directions. All azimuth and elevation calibrations were based on a contour map (Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer, DeLorme Mapping, Freeport, Maine, 1993; scale is 1:250,000 or 1 inch = 3.95 miles) so the directions and estimated elevations should be quite accurate. Locations of the lights were determined both graphically and analyti- cally (using trigonometry) and should be accurate to within several miles. A number of other lights and light arrays were seen and videotaped that night. Triangulations were accomplished for several of these, including a triangu- lar array that appeared after the linear array disappeared. (The results of these other triangulations are presented in a much more complete paper published at .www.geocities.com/area51/starg ate/55 187 maccabee.html with a link to the corresponding illus- trations published at www.riskers.org.) The triangulation results consistently showed the lights to be southwest of Phoenix at distances be- tween 60 and 80 miles from K and L, farther from R and as close as 40 miles to P. This placed the lights over the Air Force range. The durations of these lights, when they were recorded from the time of their initial appearance to disappearance with no stopping of the camera, were within the range of 4'/2 to 5 minutes. A movement to the left They moved to the left at speeds ranging from 30 to 40 mph. The altitudes were in the range 13,000 ft to about 19,000 ft, and each light dropped down- ward several thousand feet before it went out. The witnesses were looking toward the Air"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1999 Page? Force test range during these sightings. The March 13 light array The major goal of this investigation of the light arrays was to provide an accurate estimate of the dis- tance to the March 13, 1997, lights. The technique for accomplishing this was developed during the in- vestigation of the Jan. 14, 1998, light arrays, an ex- ample of which is presented in Figure 2. Having de- termined the distances to these arrays, 1 simply trans- ferred the methods and some of the calibration mea- surements to the March 13 investigation which was based on the videos of K, L, and R (P was not a wit- ness to the March 13 lights). K saw a single anomalously bright light in the sky south of his house in the direction of the Estrella range at about 10 p.m. and set up his video camera to film it. Hence he had his camera going when the arc- shaped array began to appear. He watched it form, evidently astounded at what he saw (as was his wife). He kept his video camera running as the lights started to disappear. The second light disappeared almost immediately, and the others went out (not in the order of appearance)'over the next 2 minutes. (Note: this is the video which has been shown the most in TV sto- ries about the Phoenix lights.) Witness R did not see the lights come on, but did videotape their disappearance, which occurred in a slightly different order than the disappearances in the K video. L says she initially saw six lights in the sky, but by the time she got her camera going there were only 3 left. As with the Jan. 14, 1998, triangulation, triangulation of the March 13 lights shows that they were far southwest of Phoenix over the Air Force range. Lights seemed steady One reason given for rejecting the flare hypoth- esis was that the light arrays seemed to be steady in the sky, not dropping downward as one might expect for flares on parachutes. However, the failure to notice a drop downwards of a few thousand feet at a distance of, say, 60 miles, is not surprising. The videos did provide evidence of motion of the lights. Light #9 moved in the R video over its time of visibility (about 150 seconds) downward about 1,350 ft, or about 6 mph, and leftward about 245 ft., or about 1 mph. A similar analysis of light #8 as it appears in the K video (the longest light visible in the K video, about 130 seconds) shows that it moved downward about 2,000 ft at about 10 mph and leftward about 1,300 ft at about 7 mph. The calculated downward and leftward motions of the two lights from the two videos are not equal, but they are remarkably close considering the difficulties in determining small changes in sighting direction and angular elevation in these videos. (Recall from above that at 55 miles a change in angle of only about 0.1 degree corresponds to a change in position of about 500 ft. At greater distances the distance change is even greater.) CONCLUSION The witnesses were impressed by the extreme brightness, orange color, and stability of these light arrays seen on March 13, 1997, Jan. 14, 1998, and other days not discussed here. They were convinced that the arrays were relatively close to Phoenix, per- haps near the Estrella Range or even closer. If this were so, they could not have been caused by the Air Force dropping flares. (How could the Air Force, on Jan. 14, 1998, drop flares in a straight line anyway?) Besides, they could see no smoke and no parachutes, both of which are obvious when parachute flares are observed \"close up\" (within a few miles or with pow- erful telescopes from a distance). The triangulation data, however, show that the lights actually were quite far away, much farther than the witnesses and the initial UFO investigators had believed. Furthermore, at least the lights studied in this four-month investigation were over the northeast portion of the Air Force range. (Not all lights were triangulated; some of them could have been elsewhere.) Furthermore the lights were not perfectly stationary: they did drop downward while they drifted sideways. So now the question is, how do the observations and video data compare to flares at a distance of 70 or so miles? The LUU-2B/B flare projects between 1.6 and 1.8 MCP (million candle power) and burns for 4 to 5 minutes (the longer the duration of burn, the lower the candle power). These flares are made by the Thiokol Corporation in Utah and cost several hundred dollars each in large quantity. They are intended for ground illumination so that aircraft can observe ground targets even in the dark. Although they are rated for a certain minimum illumination of the ground when dropped within a few thousand feet, they would certainly also provide some illumination even from high altitude. In particular, one might conjecture that a high altitude flare when used in combination with night vi- sion devices employed by an air crew flying at a lower altitude than the flare (so they wouldn't \"burn\" the night vision device) could provide enough light for the crew to see objects on the ground. Air Force officials who have commented on these sightings have pointed out that flares such as these could be seen perhaps as far as 200 miles. Extreme brilliance The extreme brilliance of these flares, which are not physically very large (5\" diameter, 36\" long), is such that when viewed from many miles away one"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS February 1999 MUFON UFO Journal would need high quality, powerful telescopic optics to see either the smoke or the parachute. For any lesser optical system the glare from the flare would cover a larger area on the optical focal plane than the spacing between the image of the flare and the image of the parachute. In other words, the observer would have the same problem as an astronomer trying to detect the presence of a planet (seen only by reflected light) near its parent star: the image of the star, or glare from the star image, covers up the much dimmer image of the planet. Why the orange appearance? The witnesses also reported that the lights ap- peared orange. This might be a result of transmission of light through the atmosphere over long distances, a transmission which tends to reduce the blue content, leaving the color spectrum weighted toward the orange or red, as at sunrise or sunset. (This conjecture could be tested in an experiment such as suggested below.) Finally, not to be discounted is the claim by the Maryland National Guard (statement made in late July, 1997) that on March 13, at about 10 p.m. they dropped flares over the Air Force training range at the unusually high altitude of about 15,000 ft. They were probably ejecting flares while flying home from the test range before landing at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. A single A-10, the type of plane that drops the flares, carried 8 flares. It is to be noted that the arc consisted of 8 lights (numbers 2 through 9 in order of appearance on the K video) which suggests that the light labeled #1 was the remaining flare in one A-10 and the arc was the \"full load\" of flares in another A- 10. Conclusion: flares Hence it appears reasonable to conclude that the light array of March 13, 1997, and other similar arrays such as on Jan. 14, 1998, (during a week when flare drops were being carried out over the Air Force training range) were created by high altitude flares. The witnesses, however, have stated that they would be convinced only if it can be positively demonstrated that flares dropped at high altitude and distances greater than 60 miles appear as the lights they saw and video- taped. This demonstration could be accomplished at some time when flares are being dropped by having a coordinated observation plan ready to carry out upon notification of flare drops. One or more observers close to the test area would videotape and record the timing and visual appearance of specific flares while simulta- neously having observers at great distance, such as in Phoenix, also observing and recording the same flares. Coordination could be accomplished using cell phones so that there is no question of what was being seen close-up and at great distances. Note: the analysis presented here is not in- tended to apply to the sighting events between 8 and 9 p.m. on March 13, but only to the \"10 p.m.\" sightings of bright \"stationary\" lights and light ar- rays of several minutes duration that appeared southwest of the Phoenix area. Acknowledgement This investigation could not have been carried out without the help of the witnesses and the enthusi- astic support of L, who provided testimony, video cop- ies, maps, and transportation during my visits to Phoe- nix. Aerial Phenomena Research Organization files located By Jan Aldrich PROJECT 1947, the research study of the be- ginning of the UFO era, has announced the recovery of a large portion of the microfilmed files of the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO), the first worldwide civilian UFO group to be organized. The APRO files have been inaccessible to researchers for over a decade since the demise of the organization fol- lowing the deaths of founders Coral Lorenzen in 1988 and Jim Lorenzen in 1986. Founded in 1952 and already mentioned men- acingly by the CIA Robertson Panel in January 1953, APRO collected UFO data from all over the world during its nearly four decades of existence. APRO had an extensive UFO investigative network with rep- resentatives in more than 50 countries, especially in South America. In the 1970's, with the aid of a small grant, APRO began microfilming its UFO sighting files. As many as three separate microfilm reels are thought to exist. The first microfilm roll contains reports from ancient times to December 1956. The second micro- film confirmed to exist contains reports from Decem- ber 1956 to 1962. The third microfilm, thought to ex- ist by a number of people, but yet to be confirmed, evidently covered 1962 to 1966. The microfilm was located through the cour- tesy of Brad Sparks, long time UFO researcher and former APRO assistant director of research. Sparks also had leads to the second microfilm reel which are no.w being pursued by Project 1947. The reports, letters, investigations, and news- paper clippings contained in the APRO microfilm have few duplications of the reports in the files of NICAP, CSI, CUFOS, Barry Greenwood, Dr. Leon Davidson, or Loren Gross."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1999 Page 9 Betty Cash dies on anniversary of encounter By John F. Schuessler We at MUFON mourn the passing of Betty Cash. On Dec. 29, 1998, Betty died of health prob- lems associated with the injuries that were caused by her close encounter with a UFO exactly eighteen years earlier. During the intervening years, Betty suffered more than anyone can imagine. Never a year passed that she wasn't hospitalized and treated for complica- tions arising from that initial extensive radiation expo- sure. Many times she was placed in a hospital inten- sive care unit. However, thanks to the excellent care given by doctors such as Dr. Bryan A. McClelland of Alabaster, AL, Betty survived to continue her quest for justice. She was a hero, patriot, and martyr. Betty's problems began on Dec. 29, 1980, when the then 52-year-old cafe owner and her friend and employee, Vickie Landrum, and Vickie's grand- son Colby were driving along a dark, narrow road near Huffman, TX. It was just before 9 p.m., and the road was deserted. The first indication of something unusual was the presence of a very intense light several miles ahead, just above the tall pine trees. Colby noticed it first and urged Betty and Vickie to look. Betty remarked that it was unusually bright, but soon lost sight of it due to the many trees along the road. Then, without warning, the sky seemed to split open and the object came angling down directly in front of them, settling swiftly between the trees just ahead of them and directly over the highway. It was a huge, diamond-shaped, brightly-lit vehicle, and it was so hot they were afraid to attempt to go under it. Betty brought the car to a halt, not knowing this event would change their lives forever. The car heated quickly, forcing Betty and Vickie to open the doors. Vickie stood briefly outside, but quickly returned to the safety of the car to hold and console a terrified Colby. Betty, determined to get a better look, shielded her eyes with her arm and inched forward along the side of the car. She was fully ex- posed to the heat from the object for several minutes. As the object flew away from the scene, the trio noticed helicopters flying near it. Later they were to stop the car a bit further down the road and count as many as 23 helicopters, many of them with twin rotors on top. Several other people in the area also reported seeing the helicopters, as well as the object, in the sky that night. As they proceeded homeward bound, they were relieved to get away, believing they had safely survived this very frightening event. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Before the night was over, they all started showing signs of medical problems. Betty had a head- ache by the time she arrived home and was content to sit in a chair and recover. Unfortunately, she got worse rather than better. During the next few hours her skin showed severe redness, and she developed water blis- ters on her head and face. By morning she was extremely ill and couldn't get out of bed. Right after the New Year holiday, she was taken to a hospital in Houston because she couldn't eat or drink. The hospital treated her as a burn patient. Not knowing what caused the problems, they ran a full battery of tests, establishing a health status baseline for Betty. That would prove to be valuable later. Betty remained in the hospital until Jan. 19. She went home, believing she would get better, but had to be readmitted on Jan. 25. During that period she lost much of her hair, continued to have horrible headaches, fought skin conditions caused by the burns, and had trouble eating and retaining food due to vom- iting and diarrhea. In February, when Betty left the hospital again, her wonderful mother, Pauline Collins, came to Hous- ton to take Betty back to Birmingham, AL, to care for her. Fortunately, Betty found excellent medical care in Birmingham and was able to survive many emergency visits to the hospital. Betty and Vickie, with help from MUFON and attorney Peter Gersten, tried valiantly to find out what they had been exposed to and what could be done to offset the effects of the exposure. Hundreds of letters and telephone calls to government officials were ei- ther ignored or given little more than lip service. Even after she knew that it was too late to get answers that could reverse the damage her body had sustained, Betty fought on. She said it was important for the truth to be known. She didn't want other people to have to go through what she had experienced without having a place to go for help. She was unselfish to the end. Strangely, it was the 18th anniversary of her close en- counter that she gave up the good fight. Betty had supporters throughout the world, hoping she would win the battle for truth and justice. Even though she didn't win, she did make a dent in the bureaucracy. Even more, she helped a number of medi- cal doctors understand the serious nature of exposure to some UFOs. None of them laughed at Betty, and they will be better prepared to deal with the problem the next time it occurs. All of the details of this incident have been chronicled in the book THE CASH-LANDRUM UFO INCIDENT, available from MUFON headquarters."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 February 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Evaluation of a gravitational propulsion system By J. P. Daley Copyright 1998 Abstract A gravitational propulsion system capable of traversing vast distances in a very brief time interval, which allegedly stems from a technology of extrater- restrial origin, is evaluated within the confines of pres- ently accepted physical theory. Introduction Robert Lazar 1 allegedly had \"back engineered\" the propulsion system of a spacecraft capable of inter- stellar travel at the U. S. government's area in Nevada known as \"51\" during the 1980's. The craft was re- ferred to as the \"sports model,\" and supposedly origi- nated from the fourth planet from the star \"Zeta 2 Reticuli.\" Needless to say, Lazar's story is fantastic, but his description of the propulsion system is very inter- esting. This paper attempts to evaluate his findings within the confines of accepted physical theory. Evaluation of Gravitational Propulsion Lazar describes a propulsion system that is based on the element 115 (Ununpentium). The strong nuclear force that binds the protons and neutrons of 115 allegedly extends beyond the circumference of the nucleus; this supposedly makes the strong nuclear force accessible to amplification. Lazar says that the strong nuclear force is akin to a micro version of the macro force we call gravitation, and this gravitational force is, again allegedly, utilized to curve the spacetime con- tinuum around the craft-resulting in the ability to travel interstellar distances in short order. To verify Lazar's allegations, the following questions need to be ad- dressed: 1. Is the element 115 theoretically stable, and thus potentially capable of being utilized? 2. If stable, can the strong nuclear force ex- tend beyond 115's nucleus, and thus potentially be ac- cessible? 3. Once accessible, is the strong nuclear force amplifiable? 4. If amplifiable, will the strong nuclear force physically resemble the force of gravity? 5. Can the force of gravity be utilized to curve the spacetime continuum around a spacecraft? 6. If the spacetime continuum can be curved About the author Mr. Daley was founder and president of Emrad Corp., is a member of the particle beam group of the American Physics Society, and is the author of several articles. around a spacecraft via the utilization of the force of gravity, can interstellar distances be traveled in a brief time interval without violating Einstein's theory of rela- tivity? Question 1 Is the element 115 theoretically stable, and thus potentially capable of being utilized? Possibly, since we expect an island of stability surrounding element 126. 126 is a \"magic number\" in nuclear physics 2 i.e. have closed atomic shells. A closed shell is associated with stability of the isotones, due to the high neutron separation energy encountered with the elements that have closed shells, e.g., 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126. It remains to be seen if the island of stability that is associated with element 126 will extend down the periodic chart to encompass element 115 experi- mentally, since, at the time of this writing, the element with the highest atomic number produced in a lab is element 111 (which has proved to be unstable). Question 2 If stable, can the strong nuclear force extend beyond 115 's nucleus, and thus become potentially ac- cessible? Possibly, since \"permanently deformed nuclei due indeed exist.\" 3 115 will not have a closed shell, and its \"outermost\" nucleons will have a distorting ef- fect on the nucleus. Whether the 115 will have a nucleus so distorted that the strong nuclear force will extend beyond the nucleus is unknown at this time. Question 3 Once accessible, is the strong nuclear force amplifiable? Possibly, since all of the four forces (electro- magnetism, strong nuclear forces, weak nuclear forces, and gravity) are thought to have both a particle and wave component. All waves are theoretically amplifiable. How to go about amplifying the wave form associated with the strong nuclear force is presently unknown. Question 4 If amplifiable, will the strong nuclear force physically resemble the force of gravity? Possibly. Since both the strong nuclear force and the force of gravity attract matter, they are both similar in this extent. But the strong nuclear force's"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1999 Page 11 range is very short (atomic distances or \"micro\"), op- posed to gravity's range, which is very long (cosmo- logical distances or \"macro\"). Whether the range of an amplified strong nuclear force will increase from micro to macro is presently unknown. Question 5 Can the force of gravity be utilized to curve the spacetime continuum around a spacecraft? Possibly. Miguel Alcubierre 4 has shown (in prin- ciple) that spacetime can theoretically be \"warped\" around a space craft. Unfortunately, the negative en- ergy density required to warp the spacetime continuum around the craft as described by Alcubierre exceeds the equivalent mass of the universe by many orders of magnitude, even when the spacecraft would be travel- ing at subluminal speeds. 5 Calculations that would sug- gest a more efficient means to warp the spacetime con- tinuum are presently unavailable. Question 6 If the spacetime continuum can be curved around a spacecraft via the utilization of the force of gravity, can interstellar distances be traveled in a brief time interval without violating Einstein's theory of relativ- ity? Possibly, since Alcubierre has also shown that (again, in principle) interstellar distances could poten- tially be traversed almost instantaneously without vio- lating relativity. Alcubierre's configuration has the potential of-Violating causality, however, since both spacecraft and crew can potentially travel backwards in time! Conclusions. A host of possibilities exist, but there is a sub- stantial body of information beyond our present un- derstanding. However, as much as our civilization needs to discover instantaneous interstellar travel via gravitational propulsion-based on the amplification of the strong nuclear force, which may be potentially ac- cessed through Ununpentium (element 115)-one has to wonder how a member of our civilization (Robert Lazar) came upon such intriguing possibilities!

Joe Firmage enters UFO scene with nationwide publicity Joe Firmage, a 28-year-old Silicon Valley en- trepreneur who has built two multi-million dollar com- panies, has entered the UFO world with a bang. A few weeks ago the Internet was filled with speculation re- garding a web site called Kairos, which turned out to be a teaser of sorts for Firmage's online \"book\" called The Truth, a 600-page discussion of man's role in the Universe. It is the truth, he says, that will set man free: \"If you really want to change civilization for the bet- ter, what would you do? Tell the truth. Because ulti- mately the truth will guide people where they need to go. If we knew how we were damaging the environ- ment, we could fix it. If we knew when a President was lying, we could deal with it.\" Firmage apparently got involved in the present project because of his encounter with a Christ-like entity in 1997. He characterizes this dream-like en- counter as similar to a near-death experience. The basic thesis suggested by Firmage seems to be that the Earth has been visited by extraterrestrial life forms, and that these entities have in some way contributed to our advancements in science. He sug- gests that humans will soon resolve the mysteries of gravity with a new anti-gravity vehicle. He also sees the possibility of a merging of science and religion. As part of his information campaign, Firmage has been publicizing the latest \"MJ-12\" documents being studied by Dr. Robert M. Wood, a physicist and former senior engineering manager for McDonnell Douglas. These documents indicate government coverup of crashed spacecraft, alien autopsies, and back-engineering of such things as fiber optics. Firmage, who in early January resigned his CEO position with USWeb, says he has spent $3 mil- lion thus far in furthering The Truth and other projects.

He was in the Special Forces in Vietnam and has worked as a ground crew chief for 32 years at the airport. He works with all kinds of private jets and helicopters. His first experience occurred on Dec. 15,1998, at 5:30 a.m. at Teterboro Airport in Northern New Jer- sey. The corporate airport is located about a five-minute drive from the George Washington Bridge that goes over the Hudson River into New York City. \"My hus- band left his line shack and looked towards the George Washington Bridge\" explains Mrs. Fondaciaios. \"He saw a huge row of lights that were stacked together in two rows as long as the bridge, flying very low and slow. It was coming out of a cloud bank and made a long slow turn towards the bridge. The size of it was as big as the whole span of the bridge. It was huge. It's shape was a wedge with the corners rounded. You could feel the ship move like a low grade vibration in the air, though it made no sound. At this point another worker came up in back of my husband and said, 'Oh what is that?' My husband said, 'What ever it is it's big.' Now the ship started to head up the river towards the Tappenzee Bridge. Then it went up into the clouds. As the object was leaving, my husband heard a mes- sage in his ear. It was not like a thought. 'The unset- tling in the Middle East will end. The evil alchemist will die.' \"Again on Dec. 31 at about 10:15 a.m. at the same airport my husband was in the line shack when he saw something that caught his eye in the sky. He looked up, and in the sky there were clouds, but in a small blue open patch of sky he saw a glint of light. It came from the southeast, then turned to the northeast going towards the George Washington Bridge. When he first saw it, it was moving against air traffic and bobbing up and down going against the wind. When it banked to the left and faced the sun, he could see the sun shine off the top. When it banked the other way, the bottom was a dull Grey. \"The tower saw it in their radar. The tower said it was moving erratically in altitude between 8,000 and 10,000 feet. The tower radioed aircraft in the land- ing pattern that they have an unidentified over the air- port not responding to any radio call: 'Divert from the left downwind pattern to a right downwind pattern until we determine the unidentified intentions.' The ship was 20-30 feet in diameter. About 16 people witnessed this, including the tower people.\" Thanks to Peter A. Gersten Dir.

Mystery of hole in ice in New Jersey \"Something plunged into Lake Parsippany on Christmas Eve, Dec. 24, 1998, breaking a hole in the ice 75 feet across and blowing vegetation into the air.\" \"Gifts were delivered by morning, so it wasn't St. Nick buying the farm. Nor were any meteor sightings re- ported, according to ION Weather meteorologist Bill Cotter.\" The hole in the ice caught the attention of Joe Strobel, who lives 150 feet away on a small island in the lake. He told a friend about it on Christmas morn- ing. \"They were all ready to have me committed to Greystone, the local mental health facility.\" said Strobel, a nine-year resident. \"Then they came over and they couldn't explain it. One guy lived here for 35 years and said he's never seen anything like that.\" The green vegetation was blown into the air and fell in a circle on the surrounding ice, drawing a flock of hun- gry Canada geese. A thin sheet of ice has since formed on the lake. Parsippany, NJ, is located about 20 miles northwest of New York City. (See the Daily Record of Morris County, NJ for 12/29/98, by Erik Engquist.)

When the officer contacted him again last spring, Carl was introduced to a father and son with an intriguing ac- count from the night of May 19, 1998. Using investi- gative instincts, over the ensuing months Carl relent- lessly and objectively pursued an airplane-versus-UFO question, ultimately fighting the battle to a draw. The Event At a few minutes after 10 p.m., while watch- ing TV, a 10-year-old remarked on a brilliant white light outside, low in the northeastern sky. Not bother- ing to look at first, his dad passed it off as an aircraft, but a moment later he too noticed. Familiar with all manner of high-performance aircraft from both a stint in the Air Force and technical work for Lockheed, the father was immediately struck by the absence of either position or anti-collision lights. They then headed out- side for a better look. As they gazed northward, over several seconds the white oval-seemingly only blocks away and a hun- dred or so feet aloft-moved fairly rapidly and without detectable sound from east to west until lost from sight behind a church steeple situated 400 feet north of the witnesses. The object evidently slowed or paused while out of view, then re-emerged. According to the father, it then \"just went straight up. In the blink of an eye it was gone. At a 90-degree angle and at extreme accel- eration it was out of sight.\" Immediately both noticed two red lights to the northeast in close proximity and following the same east-to-west path, but at a slower rate. These they tracked visually over three minutes or so. One drew closer to the other as they gradually decelerated and curved southward until buildings in the neighborhood blocked further observation. The father used his cell phone to contact the police even before the sighting had concluded. The Investigation To the father and son, all three lights/objects were anomalous. Carl, however, had doubts concern- ing the red lights especially. Despite his inexperience, he followed a basic tenet of MUFON investigations and embarked on a multi-pronged course to find an IFO explanation. He first contacted the air traffic control cen- ters at New Castle, Philadelphia, and New York City. That effort elicited valuable information, but also a frus- trating lack of conclusive evidence. The particular run- ways used on the night in question ruled out airplane headlights during takeoff as the source of the white oval. But Carl also learned that incoming air traffic to Philadelphia was congested at that hour, leaving nu- merous planes in holding patterns that took them over Wilmington. Armed with those insights, he addressed the white light and dual red lights separately. Concerning the white oval we must consider the following: Land- ing lights approaching from the north or northeast and viewed fairly straight on might be seen as a single oval of white, but would not appear to be moving as rapidly as the witnesses stated. If truly moving east to west across their field of vision, aircraft headlights would blend together, then gradually \"disappear.\" An aircraft travelling westward, then banking south toward the observers would appear to slow, thus perhaps accounting for the reported momentary delay while out of sight beyond the steeple. Nonetheless, only delusion would account for either the perceived proximity or vertical climb at \"extreme acceleration.\" As for the red lights, Carl postulated an air- liner moving east to west, with only two lights visible- the position light on the left wingtip and a red beacon on the belly. To illustrate this in the case report he pre- pared a detailed diagram to show that, as a plane circled in a westerly direction and then southward, its chang- ing angle relative to the observers would offer the im- pression of the two lights moving closer together. Despite repeated efforts, he was unable to ac- quire (without considerable cost) copies of the actual radar tapes to verify the presence or absence of air- craft in that vicinity between 10:05 and 10:10 p.m. Even the handwritten \"strips\" of radar data passed along to the next controller at the end of a duty shift, he learned, are retained only 15 days, then destroyed. And obtain- ing a copy of those requires a formal FOIA request and approval, in this instance from the NYC control center. In the absence of such documentation, Carl plotted the perceived flight paths as overlays on six photocopied maps showing graduated scales, from the witnesses' immediate neighborhood to the multi-city (Continued on Page 16)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 February 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Ufologv Profile Beverly Trout wears two hats: investigator and By Dwight Connelly Beverly Trout, MUFON State Director for Iowa, is a thorough, no-nonsense, hard-hitting investi- gator who fearlessly meets the media as an equal, while showing the patience and skill of a psychotherapist in working with abductees. In dealing with reporters, she has a simple policy: \"I tell them up front,\" she says firmly, \"that if they want to trivialize or sensationalize the material, then they will get no help or information from me. I take cases seriously, and I expect them to do so as well.\" Thus far, she reports, the media have been co- operative. In working with abductees, she has an impor- tant advantage when it comes to understanding their fears and their doubts-she is an abductee herself Her interest in UFOs began, consciously at least, in 1966 when a friend suggested she look into the phenomenon. \"I got Ruppelt's Report on Uniden- tified Flying Objects and John Fuller's Incident at Exeter\" she recalls. \"I was a dairy farmer's wife, and some months later we had a sighting of a small,, slow-moving light in our barnyard area. A neighbor confirmed there'd been a startling incident three miles away that same night.\" In 1967 she had what she describes as \"a dreamlike experience which seemed real-perceiving a disk, but then I was switched off. Naively, I figured the UFO occupants just didn't want me to see their craft. I didn't entertain any thought at that time that I, or some- one in my family, might be involved with abductions- yet I knew with absolute certainty that I'd been inacti- vated in my own home!\" Only puzzling dreams From 1967 to 1991, Beverly seemingly expe- rienced nothing beyond a few puzzling UFO dreams, which she paid little attention to. She was busy on the dairy farm, and, in addition, dealing with an unhappy marriage. She eventually ended up as a single mother with teenagers. Suddenly, in 1991, Beverly had a series of dis- turbing dreams. \"It seemed as though a switch was turned on, and I began to read UFO literature vora- ciously,\" she recalls. \"That fall I became a member of MUFON.\" Two years later, she decided to see if hypnosis could unlock some of the experiences that she felt were there, but could not consciously recall. \"This was not Beverly Trout really hypnosis,\" she explains. \"I simply am not a good subject for hypnosis. I tend to analyze and question too much to be truly hypnotized. I stay conscious. I interact briefly, but refuse to re-experience the trauma, keeping the sessions emotionally cool. My hypnosis sessions might better be termed remote viewing ses- sions-and I use that term only because I can't think of a better way to describe it.\" After a great deal of new information came from these sessions, conducted by Dr. Grey Woodman, a psychiatrist, Beverly experienced what she describes as \"a high state of self-doubt.\" She wondered if she had confabulated. \"How could I have had all those experiences,\" she asked herself, \"going back to child- hood?\" An unsettling revelation Perhaps most unsettling was the revelation that she had been abducted at four years of age from the back yard on her parents' farm in broad daylight. In this incident, her reproductive system had been checked, and \"some sort of corrections were made.\" The aliens also seemed concerned about the inside of her left arm (a serious skin condition in that spot was not diagnosed until many years later). \"I wondered,\" she says, \"if reading all that UFO literature had con- taminated me.\" However, something else emerged from her childhood abduction that seemed to confirm that she"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1999 Page 15 was not imagining everything. During a hypnotic ses- sion she had described a machine she had observed as a four-year-old-a machine with a label which seemed to have the word or letters, \"g-o-r-s-t\" on it. \"When I spelled this out during the session,\" explains Beverly, \"my analytical left-brain went into high gear, and I dis- gustedly exclaimed, 'It doesn't mean anything to me!' That evening I tried to look it up in the dictionary. I even tried the phone book. Nothing.\" A couple of months later she mentioned it to a friend, who mentioned it to another friend, who looked it up in a large comprehensive dictionary. She found that 'gorst' was an Old English expression related to horror. \"Well, I guess I had experienced horror, all right,\" says Bev, \"being abducted as a four-year-old, but I certainly had never heard of'gorst' before-at least not in this lifetime.\" Another incident She also recalled under hypnosis another day- time incident when she was seven; and also at age 11 being taken from a tractor in a hayfield. In that inci- dent, an area above her right eyebrow was opened and a tiny coil was introduced which corrected an area of swollen brain tissue. A reptilian seemed to be in charge. She also recalled under hypnosis a strange event which occurred in 1980, when she was in her yard between the house and garage. \"As the aliens ap- parently began to control my movements, something went wrong, and suddenly I was slammed against the brick garage, dazed, lying on the grass with my right eye filled with blood. Quickly, a tall alien was beside me, and I was hustled on board. It seemed, though, that they could not work on me immediately, since there was a young man on the table. They simply propped me against the wall until they finished with him. Then there was some fairly drastic surgery done to repair the eye. And yes, I can vaguely recall some sort of eye problem in the 1980's.\" Conscious encounters In the fall of 1993, came two conscious en- counters, only 12 weeks apart. The first encounter oc- curred in a Motel 6 in Winnemucca, NV, in the early hours of Sept. 6. She was awakened, but not taken from the room. The entities simply sat down and com- municated with her. \"Sorry-no big, important, global message,\" she notes. \"1 was told they'd no longer keep me from remembering, and that there could be further conscious contact. I'm convinced they were just set- ting me up for what they really wanted 12 weeks later.\" What they wanted in that follow-up encoun- ter-which took place in the early hours of Nov. 22, 1993, at her residence in Iowa-was more surprising, more bizarre than she could ever have imagined. She was again intentionally awakened by the same exter- nal energy she had felt in Nevada. \"As they rolled and floated me out of bed, I was determined to remain con- scious, but as we left the building, I lost it. When I regained consciousness, I was sprawled on the floor in my sleeping loft, and I realized that two aliens were in the room with me. One of them was very active, the other was keeping me under control. (Later, under hyp- nosis, I noted that one of them was busily scanning in my computer area.) Then I felt a light slap on my but- tocks, and I was back in bed and under my own con- trol.\" \"Exploring the incident further under hypno- sis, I saw that while in the aliens' custody I'd been approached by a 'cowboy' (with blanked-out facial features), then led before a group of 'people,' all of whom were dressed in country-western clothing. But I instantly knew they weren't dressed right-that their country-western garb was decidedly inappropriate. For example, instead of cowboy boots, they wore mud boots. Their clothing colors were badly coordinated, and for some reason they were shuffling their feet as they stood in lines before me. They didn't look very lively, and I got the impression they were disadvan- taged somehow, that they needed help. Line dancing \"Later, I felt stupid for not instantly recogniz- ing what was happening-these were hybrids, and I was expected to teach them line dancing. I think that the alien scanning my computer later that night was prob- ably going through the dance files stored there.\" Beverly has, in fact, taught line dancing to literally thou- sands of people during the past eight years, as well as doing DJ work at holiday and party dance events in Des Moines, IA, and surrounding areas. This experience upset Beverly. \"I was actually outraged,\" she explains. \"I never expected to run into this sort of preposterous alien-human interaction. I felt as if I'd been blind-sided. Of course, being blind-sided by aliens is nothing new.\" These experiences, of course, affect her role as an investigator. For the most part, she has not . revealed her abduction experiences to Iowa media, or even to the adult education class on UFOs that she teaches through the Des Moines school system. \"However,\" she notes, \"there are times when I feel I have to reveal my experiences to abductees. There is an on-going case, for example, where I felt I could not leave the family in ignorance and fear-just so I could get better uncontaminated evidence. (See \"An Alien Big Push?\" in the August, 1998, issue of the Journal.} Only when necessary \"That doesn't mean I push my experiences at all,\" she explains. \"I reveal what I have gone through"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 February 1999 MUFON UFO Journal only as there seems to be a real need to do so. Some- times abductees need to know that they are not alone, and that others have survived the experience more or less intact. They need to face the fear that is there, and admit their need to cope with a wider slice of reality than they had expected.\" Thoughts about aliens With such a variety of experiences, what does Beverly think of aliens? \"They're manipulative,\" she says. \"But there also seems to be a repulsion-fascination reaction among many abductees, myself included. One abductee who reported outrage at being abducted also very honestly admitted to me that he didn't want the aliens to go away. Other abductees have confided that they miss the aliens when they don't come around. And when I look at my own case, I remember being grate- ful to the aliens when they visited me in Nevada and told me there could be further conscious encounters. So 1 have to admit that I find myself see-sawing be- tween bemoaning the manipulation inherent in abduc- tion scenarios, and looking forward to further interac- tion. It's the damnedest thing! A very unbalanced rela- tionship!\" In attempting to assess her experiences, she even questions whether she has somehow volunteered to be an abductee. \"Do I have some sort of agreement with them?\" she asks. \"I don't feel comfortable with that idea, but I can't rule it out.\" Beverly wonders if she has been drawn into a role that fits the alien agenda. \"Make no mistake,\" she says, \"they have an agenda.\" But despite her reser- vations about the aliens, she sees the possibility of agreement on one point: \"I know that I want-and I believe that they want-abductees to be able to cope with their alien-human interaction,\" she says. \"So on that point, yes, maybe we are collaborating, to a de- gree. Still, the bottom line for me is that I can't believe that the universe likes manipulation, and I have yet to meet a non-manipulative alien. I don't hate them, but I think it would be a tremendous mistake to deify, to worship them.\" Stay tuned Beverly will provide an update and additional details at the annual MUFON 1999 International UFO Symposium in Arlington, VA, (Washington, D. C.) July 2-4 in a talk entitled, \"Talking Back-To Aliens and to Humans.\" Her presentation last year at Lou Parish's 10th Annual Ozark UFO Conference was, in my view, the highlight of a very interesting conference-and she will again address the Ozark UFO Conference this coming April on \"Alien Confusion, Alien Mistakes- and Human Attitudes.\" Case of the Month...

As to observer credibility, he considered the father's obvious knowledge of aircraft, but also, from multiple interviews, noted the man's interest in the UFO subject. Also, as to their state of mind, he cited the specific program (\"The X-Files\") they had just con- cluded watching when the event occurred, as well as a son's natural inclination to underscore his father's state- ments. Given all the factors to be weighed, Carl prop- erly drew no conclusion as to just what they saw. Along the way, he obtained a printout of precise weather con- ditions for that hour from the National Climatic Data Center (828-271-4800). He also contacted the Metro- politan Life Insurance Company and thereby ruled out a blimp (which was in the state to cover a golf tourna- ment). The case report contains E dozen photos of the witnesses' neighborhood, showing the church and other landmarks, and including views from the window where the observation began. MUFON Forms 1 and 2, wit- ness sketches, interview transcripts, and an index of all case materials supplement the investigator's narra- tive. Precisely because Carl Feindt went the extra mile, his report must be assessed as complete, but in- conclusive. Doing so requires speculation that a man who was highly experienced in aircraft identification- and a resident of that area for three decades-may have nonetheless (a) mistaken distant aircraft landing lights as a single oval of light nearby, (b) inserted in his mind that the white light(s) rose vertically at great accelera- tion, then (c) immediately misidentified aircraft run- ning lights as well. These misperceptions, the argu- ment would hold, were shared by his pre-adolescent son. Postscript One further possibility exists. In the annals of UFO casework, anomalous vehicles have frequently been reported near commercial airports. When an air- craft approached, the unconventional vehicle was of- ten reported to ascend skyward \"in the blink of an eye.\" Did a father and son in this instance first observe a genuine UFO (the oval of white) that quickly exited the path of a circling airliner (two red lights) which, in their excitement, they misidentified as a second anomaly? Perhaps. But we will never know."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1999 Page 17 The UFO PRESS ...\" Bob Pratt Brazilian UFO cases UFO Danger Zone — Terror and Death in Bra- zil by Bob Pratt, Horus House Press, Inc., P.O. Box 55185, Madison, WI, 1996. (S'/zxS'/i paperback). Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Bob Pratt, a former editor of the Journal and a respected researcher for more than a score of years, has written a fas- cinating book about an area of the world that most of us know too little about. He has done this the hard way: by going to the witnesses and studying individual cases. In the process he has also met and worked with some of the top researchers in Brazil. Pratt de- scribes himself as a believer in the reality of UFOs, \"not from having seen one, but from having talked with people who have-so far about seventeen hundred people in Brazil and nine other countries.\" This account is the result often visits to Brazil by Pratt, resulting in six months of investigations of several dozen victims. Journal readers will also recall the more recent two-part series he did with Cynthia Luce, \"Varginha, Brazil, ET crash, capture,\" in the August and September 1998 issues of the Journal. Make no mistake—Brazilian UFO cases are, for the most part, quite different from cases that have occurred in the U.S. The term \"victims\" truly describes many Brazilians who have encountered UFOs. As Pratt de- scribes in detail, we see behavior on the part of UFO occupants seems to be unique to Brazil. Many times the UFOs have tried to pull their conscious victims into the craft with some unseen force. Even more strange, grappling hooks have been reported, as has the pouring of hot liquids onto victims who would not let go of trees or bushes. This pulling of people toward the UFOs seems to be so widespread that it appears to be com- mon knowledge in Brazil that one should grab onto some object when a UFO is spotted. Sometimes there is a cat and mouse encounter where victims are terri- fied as the UFOs try to flush them out of hiding. Beams of light have even penetrated homes and burned men and women inside. Although Pratt has investigated cases from the middle of the Amazon to the northern areas and down the east coast, he has concentrated his work on the Northeast, where a majority of activity has taken place. With only 300-400 UFO investigators in a country of 60,000,000 people covering an area as large as the U.S., no doubt many cases never come to the atten- tion of researchers. Even so, Brazil is recognized as one of the most UFO-active countries in the world. In reviewing a book or film, it is tempting to give away the plot. Since this is one of my pet peeves when I read reviews, I will try to avoid doing this. However, I do want to briefly look at just one of the many amazing cases described in this book. This is the case of Joe Benedito Bogea. It begins the night of July 10, 1977. Bogea suddenly sees a greenish-blue light which chases him, then circles over a bush and briefly stays about 10-12 feet off the ground. He shines his flashlight at the vee-shaped object, and is knocked unconscious by a bright flash of light which he says felt like an electri- cal shock. He awakes seven hours later near Sao Luis, many miles from where he had been struck by the beam. Everything seems to be in bright, vivid colors, and he feels terrible pain in his right side. \"I thought I would die,\" he recalls. When he got home the next day he realized he had lost his thick eyeglasses, but also discovered that he did not need them anymore. Thirteen years earlier he had been operated on for severe headaches, and the operation had impaired his sight and left him deaf. Bogea also discovered that he could hear \"a little now.\" In what seemed to be something similar to a dream— and yet not a dream—he recalled being taken to a strange city where all the buildings looked alike and the temperature was uniformly cool. I will drop the story at this point, since the case is lengthy, but it is worth noting that Bogea wants the UFO to return. \"I was crippled for two months,\" he notes, but says the encounter was \"wonderful and very beautiful.\" In another area, Colares, one of 30 villages at the mouth of the Amazon, many people were injured in UFO encounters in a 1977 wave. Dr. Wellaide Cecim Carvalho, the only physician on the island, told Pratt that she had treated \"approximately 40 people, mostly adults,\" for injuries connected with the sightings. These injuries were \"mostly burns to the chest, like sunburns, near the face, the throat,\" the doctor reported, who added, \"The skin peeled off. These UFO burns began to peel and heal almost im- mediately. Very interesting cases. I could see two small puncture wounds in the center of these burns.\" Dr. Carvalho also reported two deaths, a male fisher- man and a female domestic worker, and said the Air Force (\"Hollanda's team,\") had brought in drugs to calm people down. The doctor had not believed the UFO reports at first, saying, \"I thought they were crazy, but after"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 February 1999 MUFON UFO Journal about the fifth case I began to take it seriously...For a long time the sheriff, the priest, and I were the only professionals in Colares. When the UFOs came to Colares, many people left. No stores were open. We had little to eat except eggs and farinha. The fisher- men wouldn't fish, because they were afraid.\" These are only a couple of the incidents which Pratt has investigated and described in detail. Knowl- edge of UFOs without knowledge of what has hap- pened in Brazil is only partial knowledge. This book should be in the library of everyone who is even a little bit serious about the UFO phenomenon. Ramey letter on CD-Rom Scans-Super-High Resolution Images of \"Ramey Memo,\" CD-ROM, by Stanton Friedman. Available directly from Friedman at 79 Pembroke Crescent, Fredericton, NB Canada E3B 1V1, or toll free in US and Canada at 1-877-457-0232. $25.00, postpaid. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly For those not directly involved in attempting to decipher the memo in the hand of Gen. Roger Ramey as he posed with Col. Thomas DuBose and the alleged debris from a site near Roswell, NM, this CD-ROM is probably as good as it is likely to get. Readers are of course familiar with the overall photos taken by J. Bond Johnson, and additional details are outlined by Fried- man into the sidebar story on this page. The CD itself features a high resolution en- larged digital image of the memo portion of an 11x14 print obtained from the University of Texas, Arling- ton, Archives, as well as the memo portion of an 8x10 print obtained by Friedman 20 years ago from the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, \"long before the original nega- tive was degraded by excessive handling.\" Also included is an 8x10 print of the memo portion made at Friedman's request a few months ago by the University of Texas. This, according to Fried- man, is the equivalent of the memo portion of a print roughly 55x70 inches. In addition, the CD includes scans, back and front, of the memo portion of the original 4x5 Ansco film negative taken by the Speed-Graphic camera used by Bond. These scans were done by an imaging com- pany in Dallas. Besides the images, Friedman has also included the background article which is printed as a sidebar in this issue of the Journal. The CD—all 188 MB—was compiled by Rob Belyea, owner and operator of ProLab in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, which Friedman says is \"one of the top photo imaging labs in Canada.\" My own reaction to the CD is a combination of fascination and frustration. These images are im- pressive, and they are exciting in that they potentially hold some key answers to the Roswell case. But they are also frustrating. Squint as I might, zoom in on them as I might, I still can't read the darn things. The words are there, as can be clearly observed in the images of limited magnification, but they just sort of fall apart as they are enlarged—at least on the two monitors I tested them with. In other words, you are probably not going to be able to read anything from this CD, but it's a heck of a collector's item, it provides a lot of insight into the problem, and it's a great conversation piece. Friedman recounts experiences with photos of Ramey By Stanton T. Friedman When I began the civilian research on the Roswell, NM, crashed saucer story in 1978,1 had no idea that it would become one of the best known UFO cases ever, or that I would still be doing more research 20 years later. I located many witnesses, have been to 18 archives seeking documents about Roswell-and es- pecially Operation Majestic 12, and to many libraries looking for newspaper coverage. My name is on a number of papers and the books Crash at Corona and TOPSECRET/MAJIC. I talk about the case in my CD- ROM : \"UFOs: The Real Story,\" and in my videos, \"UFOs are Real\" and \"Flying Saucers Are Real.\" I keep saying that I am racing the undertaker, since many key witnesses have died-not surprising af- ter 51 years. Still I am embarrassed that I had more or less ignored what may turn out to be a crucial \"docu- ment\" that I first located about 20 years ago. I had contacted the Ft. Worth, Texas, Star Tele- gram back then after Bill Moore had dug out a number .of newspaper articles about Roswell at the Periodicals Department of the University of Minnesota Library in Minneapolis. I had shared with him the information that I had obtained earlier from Jesse Marcel, the In- telligence officer of the 509th Composite Bomb Group in Roswell, who had recovered saucer wreckage from a ranch North of Roswell, as well as the story told me by Jean and Vern Maltais about Barney Barnett's ex- perience finding saucer wreckage and strange bodies in New Mexico. But neither could pin down a date. Bill had found the third story: Hughie Green hearing about a New Mexico crashed saucer on the radio while driv- ing from Los Angeles to Philadelphia. Green could pin down the date to late June or early July 1947. Bill found the articles and shared them with me .There were pic- tures of Jesse, Gen. Roger Ramey, Col. T.J. DuBose,"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal February 1999 Page 19 and meteorologist Irving Newton with the substituted wreakage of a radar reflector and weather balloon taken in Ramey's office at Ft. Worth Army Air Field. I con- tacted the Star Telegram and got copies of their ar- ticles and pictures, made from the original negatives. I have used slides of some of these in most of my lec- tures since 1980. Thus, when the original Fort Worth photogra- pher, J. Bond Johnson, made a big fuss in mid 1998 about new enlarged prints showing the real so-called I-beams with strange symbols described by Dr. Jesse Marcel Jr., I, too, ordered a new set-this time 11 \"xl4\"- from the University of Texas, Arlington, Archives. The newspaper had donated its old files to the Special Col- lections Department at the Archives. It turns out Bond wasn't familiar with the I- beam replica and symbols that had been created, based on Dr. Marcel's testimony. We argued about what was in the pictures. I discussed Bond's claims with Dr. Marcel, and we agreed that we could see no signs of the I-beams or symbols. However, we both paid no attention to the memo that Gen. Ramey, head of the 8th Air Force, of which the 509th was a part, held in his hand-actually in 3 different pictures. In two, no print is visible, but the third, when seen in enlarge- ment, clearly had print on it. There had been various efforts made over the years to read the memo, but to no avail. But that was before modern computer image scanning equipment and software became available. So I was both caught short and ready to look when Ron Regehr, an aerospace en- gineer on the West Coast, whom I have known for sev- eral years, announced that he and Bond and others had actually been able to read some of the words. One phrase really caught my eye: \"2nd crash site SW of Magdalena.\" That didn't mean anything to Ron, but it surely did to me. The Barney Barnett story had taken place in the Plains of San Augustin, SW of Magdalena. Magdalena at that time was a thriving town. The rail head was located in Magdalena, so ranchers drove their cattle there across the flat plains surrounded by mountains. There were many operating mines in the vicinity. Now it is almost a ghost town because the rail head left years ago with the advent of big trucks, and the mines have closed. I immediately approached Rob Belyea, owner of Pro-Lab, just a mile from my home in Fredericton, one of the top ten photographic labs in Canada. Rob, with more than 30 years experience in the photogra- phy business, has very sophisticated software for scan- ning and digitalizing pictures, slides, etc. I had seen him in action concerning some other pictures and was very favorably impressed. He scanned both my 11x14 and my old 8x10. The latter was much cleaner, since the negative had obviously not been handled much when I obtained my prints in 1978.1 managed to con- vince the UTA person to have an 8x10 print made of the small area including the memo. Rob indicated that the negative had more in- formation than any print, but UTA wouldn't let it out of their sight. I talked to the Star Telegram, and they indicated mild interest in having the scan done, and they still had, by the terms of their original gift, the right to use any of the material that had been donated. I also discussed the problems with Victor Golubic of Phoenix, who has for years been research- ing various aspects of the Roswell story, such as the medical staff and witness testimony out in the plains. He managed to locate a really topnotch image scan- ning company in Dallas, not far from the UTA. I had to pay for the negative to be escorted to their facility and for the scanning of the front and back of the memo portion of the 4x5 negative on to a CD ROM. The Speed Graphic was the standard press camera in 1947, with thick sheet film. A scan was also done of the en- tire negative. Not surprisingly there is a lot of noise in all the scans. But with 4 different scans available-the origi- nal 8x 10 print, the 11 x 14 print, the large cropped 8x10, and the negative-! am confident that the puzzle will be solved. There are complications, such as the paper having been folded, and different parts of the memo being at different distances from the camera and not being uniformly illuminated by the big bright flash- bulb used. All of the scans have been added to the nega- tive scans on the same CD-ROM. One fascinating question is whether the United States Air Force, which had obtained a duplicate nega- tive from UTA and claimed in its huge Project Mogul report that they had found nothing of interest after hav- ing another agency, presumably the CIA, process it, has gone and looked again after becoming aware of this new interest. This is one case where nobody can claim that the evidence has been tampered with, since the negative has been under control for 51 years. The odds would seem to be much better than even that the memo will be deciphered, thanks to the talents of people like Ron Regehr, Rob Belyea, and Victor Golubic, and the dogged persistence of J. Bond Johnson. PROJECT 1947 MUFON has a limited supply of Jan Aldrich's 209 page book titled A Preliminary Report On The 1947 UFO Sighting Wave published by the UFO Research Coalition.

We have photo analy- sis, the perils of a case investi- gation, a rather convoluted take on abduction reports, more \"raw\" sighting reports, and an interesting personality profile on Stan Gordon, among other tid- bits. Now the question is, how much of this actually advances our understanding of the UFO mystery? The straight scientific analysis is fine, always pending badly needed peer review. Bruce Maccabee does his usual thorough analysis of the July 2,1998, videotape. Paul Cook got his feet wet on a tricky case investigation, and makes some instructive comments. George Filer's reports and the \"Malta UFO Roundup\" give us raw material to chew over, and Dan Wright's critique is constructive as usual. Most of my comments this time will be con- fined to the \"philosophical\" content and issues raised in some of the other articles. The article by Eve Frances Lorgen asserting \"alien-orchestrated human bonding dramas\" appears to be based on a very literal reading of what abductees are reporting. In my work with something like 150 abductees by now, I have seen very much the same patterns and \"stories\" reported by the best-known ab- duction investigators and reflected here. However, I am much less inclined to take the \"stories\" at face value. In other words, I don't question the accuracy of Lorgen's reporting, only her interpretations. Loosely speaking, I don't doubt at all that some kind of \"alien intelligence\" is messing with us and ma- nipulating us, and indeed having a profound effect on many people's lives. So any conscientious attempt to face up to this and honestly seek some answers is wel- come. What abductees are reporting can accurately be described, somewhat poetically rather than scientifi- cally, as \"alien orchestrated bonding exercises\"-IF they really are happening in the real, physical world. What Lorgen reports is at least a \"sociological truth,\" and therefore important to study. I have interviewed people who exactly fit the reported \"characteristic pattern.\" Next question: What does this pattern mean, or what does it prove? First of all, the assumption that \"alien intelli- gence\" lies behind the phenomenon, while not unrea- sonable (and in fact I accept that as a valid assump- tion), is an unproved hypothesis in itself. Science re- quires examining and ruling out alternative hypotheses. The subjective elements of abduction reports should be obvious to anyone who has studied the matter in any depth, and the dividing line between established physical facts and subjectively believed items is very blurred. This casts our entire \"data base\" into serious question. Often the \"love bitten\" couples assert as fact things that they only think, or suspect, or are guessing to be factual. The more I have studied the abduction phe- nomenon, the more I have come to the conclusion that even our top, highly regarded investigators in this field have gradually slipped past facts and evidence into areas of very questionable speculation. In scientific terms, I think their conclusions are far outstripping the available data, and are increasingly unfounded. More and more, their views are built on air castles: layer upon layer of assumptions. It is somewhat ironic that I have made exactly the same argument against the logic and reasoning of astronomers orcosmologists whose assumptions have led them to the conclusion that there is no intelligent life elsewhere in the universe! Stan Gordon is a worthy subject for a profile, as someone who has worked hard to gather and sift evidence for many years. He has suggested a UFO- Bigfoot connection in the past, which I felt was ques- tionable, but here qualifies his statements properly as to the speculative nature of such an association. It is important that there be scientific dialogue on the matters reported and issues raised in the Jour- nal, and Dwight Connelly is doing a good job of lead- ing things in that direction. Peer review, it is called. Opinions (yours, mine, anyone else's), reported facts, analyses, all need to be examined critically, not simply taken at face value. When that is done, \"scien- tific ufology\" will no longer be an oxymoron.

One of these was the MUFON UFO INFORMATION CENTER AND MUSEUM, located in an office complex on the main north-south highway Bypass 123 through Seguin, TX. This is a separate facility only a few blocks from MUFON's business office at 103 Oldtowne Road. We are no longer receiving funding from the Bigelow Foundation. The fundamental purpose of the UFO Infor- mation Center is public education for the general pub- lic and media, as well as UFO aficionados. This is the only UFO museum in the United States east of Roswell, NM. MUFON members from coast to coast and bor- der to border have visited the museum, including visi- tors from eight different countries. We do not charge admission, but solicit donations only. The donations do not cover the monthly rent of $350 for the 500- square-foot facility. Even though our information cen- ter and museum is very attractive and popular, atten- dance does not approach the tens of thousands of people who tour the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell—and the resulting donations. Over the years MUFON has received dona- tions that are l.R.S. tax deductible for the donor. These gifts are very much appreciated; however, they are far from adequate to cover the annual rent of $4200 for the museum. MUFON has never before in its nearly thirty years of operation solicited funds from our mem- bers to support projects. In order to keep the doors open at our museum, so as to continue to educate the public, we are taking this occasion to ask for dona- tions. Those of you who have visited our museum recognize its importance and the unique displays. We have had photographs in the MUFON UFO Journal for those of you who haven't had the privilege of see- ing this one-of-a-kind unique display. The MUFON office acknowledges all donations of any size with a letter that you can attach to your annual income tax statement. If you want to see our UFO Information Cen- ter and Museum continue to share its displays, exhib- its, and photographs with people interested in learning more about the UFO phenomenon, this is your oppor- tunity to step forward and make a generous gift. We thank you in advance for your consideration, and es- pecially to those of you who have already responded. MUFON E-MAIL REVISION As of Jan. 1, 1999, John F.Schuessler, Deputy Director of Administration (Littleton, CO), has been supervising the operation of MUFON's e-mail service (mufonhq@aol.com). We are indebted to Thomas P. Deuley, Corporate Secretary, for establishing our e-mail facility a few years ago, and later securing the assis- tance of three members to help him perform this vital function. Your Director wants to express his apprecia- tion to Bob Coddington (Richmond, VA), Cynthia Hall (Graysville, GA), and Kathleen Anderson (Se- attle, WA) for volunteering to assist Tom Deuley in this time-consuming but essential job. Many people believed that their e-mail com- munications were being sent directly to the MUFON headquarters office in Seguin, TX, and expected an immediate reply. John Schuessler has confirmed the study that Mr. Deuley conducted, which found that it required eight hours per day to process the e-mail. Your International Director could not add eight more hours to his daily 10-12 hour daily work schedule. This is why Tom Deuley asked for members' help when he got more involved in UFO Research Coalition projects. Mr. Schuessler still wants to retain the assis- tance of the three volunteers. The e-mail correspon- dence to your Director had deteriorated to the speed of \"snail mail,\" since both Bob Coddington and Tom Deuley were mailing the print-outs to me a weekly batch at a time. The answers had to take the same route, which was entirely unsatisfactory. John Schuessler will now answer most of the e-mail questions daily and send the remainder by FAX to me on the date of receipt for my response. This ar- rangement has been working very well. I personally want to commend John for volunteering to operate MUFON's e-mail function. I apologize for any delays occurring previously in our e-mail operation, because it certainly was not satisfactory in terms of being timely."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 February 1999 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE Walter Andrus TOT\" D' NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK NEW OFFICERS State Director for Maine, Leland P. \"Bud\" Bechtel, Ph.D. (Weld), relinquished his position and appointed Robert B.

It will be held at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City, 2799 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202 near the renamed Ronald Reagan National Airport on July 2, 3, and 4, 1999. The theme of the '99 Symposium is \"Transcend- ing Politics and Comfort Zones in Ufology,\" which is quite fitting due to the proximity of Washington, D.C., just across the Potomac River. Confirmed speakers to date are Beverly J. Trout, Budd Hopkins, Stanton Friedman (Canada), Jenny Randies (England), Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Robert P. Swiatek, Eve Frances Lorgen, Thomas Eddie Bullard, Ph.D., Richard H. Hall, and S. Peter Resta, Ph.D. The attractive room rate of $89 per night has been negotiated for the symposium, and this price al- lows for up to four (4) people per room. When making reservations, be sure to identify the MUFON sympo- sium and specify that you want one king-size bed or two doubles. Make your reservations directly with the hotel at 1-800-228-9000, To register for the symposium, please mail a check or money order payable to: MUFON '99 Inter- national UFO Symposium and mail to 7873 Heritage Dr., Suite 574, Annandale, VA 22003.

The State/Provincial Director's Meeting will be held on Friday, July 2, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. All Assistant State Directors are also invited. If a State or Provincial Director is unable to attend, he/she should designate a member to represent them. Our MUFON Symposium will conclude at ap- proximately 6 p.m. on Sunday, July 4, giving everyone adequate time to get situated for the National Fireworks on the Mall, starting at approximately 9 p.m. With all the fascinating archives, museums and monuments to see, there is clearly something for the entire family to enjoy. Plan to visit Washington, D.C., for the Fourth of July weekend.
