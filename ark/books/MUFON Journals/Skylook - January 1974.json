PERSONAL; To The Readers  . \"Parting as such sweet sorrow\" according to Mr. Shake- speare's Juliet—but I don't agree, as I come to the point where I have to announce this is Ye Ed's last issue of SKYLOOK. Parting is just—sorrow. . ,  - Because of arthritis, there are too many days when I can't type. With help, I managed to get out the last two issues; but correspondence has been woefully neglected and I finally reached the point where I realized I must step aside. I informed Director Walt Andrus and the staff a month ago and now must say farewell to you. I have enjoyed my work and am proud of never missing a publication date since becoming publisher as well as editor in 1969. All credit goes to you readers and my wonderful staff. There has never been lack of good copy and I have a big \"box full\" which I am turning over to the new editor so he may draw on the vast amount of reports and news clips for material when (or if) UFO sightings slow down. I have always said the fringe benefits of being an editor are great. I have helped contribute to informing the public re UFOs(and have learned a lot along the way), made a lot of interesting contacts, and have made some warm, and personal friends with whom I certainlv hope to keep in close touch (as I am able to keep up with correspondence). Suggest you address envelopes now to Mrs. Donald H. Short, Box 129, Stover, Mo., 650?S; as I will assume material addressed to Norma E. Short and/or SKYLOOK for the next several weeks will be intended for our magazine and will forward same to our new editor. And, if there is anything \"sweet\" in parting, it is knowing I am turning over SKYLOOK to a man so well qualified to improve it and to build it into THE leading UFO magazine. I confidently look forward to this happen- ing and will be proud of having had a part in those beginning steps. I will continue to be a member of MUFON and will help in any way I can. Now for some loose ends —because I couldn't do that much typing, I did not send out postcard acknowledgments for subscriptions received the past month or more. If you sent $5 before Dec. 1st (the day the new rate went into effect) your subscription was moved up three months. If you sent $4 for a subscription after Dec. 1st, it was adjusted. Please note the expiration date for your sub- scription as shown on all address labels for this issue. In many cases, I could not begin a subscription with the back issue, or issues requested, so began with the Dec- ember issue. If you have any question, please write to me NOW before I turn all my records over to the new editor. I have a stack of unanswered letters which I will get to as I can, so don't count me out.

Box 53, Dollard-Des-Ormeaux, P.Z., Canada H9 G 2H5, as the Provincial Director for Quebec. Henry H. McKay and John B. Musgrave presently serve as Provincial Directors for Ontario and Alberta respectively. Specialists have recently joined the staff of .MUFON with the selection of Rod B. Dyke, 3521 S.W. 104th, Seattle, Washington, 98146, as UFO Newsclip Data Direct-- or. Rod is best known for his outstanding worldwide UFO news clipping service op- erating as the UFO Research Committee. It is the finest such service today in the UFO field and is highly recommended to serious UFO researchers. In order that MUFON may work closer with Dr. David R. Saunders, MUFON Consultant in Statistics at the University of Colorado, David L. Carmichael, 1230 Pamela Drive, Florissant, Missouri, 63031, telephone AC3U 831-4451, has volunteered to serve as Director of Data Processing in a staff capacity. David is a systems analyst/project manager with McDonnell-Douglas and has done extensive work in data processing as a consultant. It is with deep regret that we accept the resignation of Mrs. Norma E. Short, who has been the editor of SKYLOOK for over six years. Since becoming the Official Pub- lication of the Mutual UFO Network in 1969, SKYLOOK, under Norma's editorship, has become one of the leading UFO publications in the world and one of the few that is published on a monthly basis. Norma and her outstanding staff are to be commended for their dedication, in not only providing a medium for sharing UFO reports, but in helping to educate the general public so as to remove some of the mystery ass- ociated with the UFO phenomena. The January, 1974, issue of SKYLOOK will be edited and published by Mrs. Short so that continuity may be accomplished during the trans- itional period of relocation and contracting for a new printer. We in MUFON sadly accept Norma's resignation, but this may not compare to her personal disappointment in reluctantly giving up her \"child,\" so to speak. She has nurtured her \"child\" month after month and j^ear after year until it has become part of her life. However, the most important factor in this era has been the growth of her \"child\" to an adult fun fledged UFO magazine. The selection of an editor to perpetuate Norma's dedicated service to SKYLOOK has been an extremely difficult assignment. Several very competent and qualified indi- vidu als have expressed their desire to assume this important responsibility. However, the amount of time required to properly handle the assignment is the one element that most precludes their acceptance of the job. The search to secure an editor and publisher to maintain the monthly continuity of SKYLOOK has been rewarded in this announcement by Mrs. Short, the SKYLOOK Staff, and the Mutual UFO Network: Mr. Dwight Connelly, 26 Edgewood Drive, Quincy, 111., 62301, telephone AC217 223-3746, will become editor and publisher on January 1, 1974. Mr. Connelly has a Masters Degree in Journalism and has been an instructor and professor of Journalism and English at both the high school and university level. A complete resume of Dwight's educational background is contained in this issue of SKYLOOK. He will accept the full responsibility for SKYLOOK with the Feb- : ruary, 1974, issue. The Staff of SKYLOOK is looking forward to working with Dwight in his new assignment and express their full support and cooperation. Walt Andrus Director, MUFON ,IMPORTANT! To Our Staff, Exchange Magazines, and Readers — As.of today, send all copy, news clips and any material for SKYLOOK to Mr. Dwight Connelly, 26 Edgewood , Drive, Quincy,, 111., 62301; so he can begin working on the February issue of SKYLOOK, If you are sending news clips which you wish returned to you, be sure to ^tate this.

Man Observes UFO Landing David Swanner, of Giles County, Tenn., told Stanley Ingram of the \"PulaskL Citizen\" that he was in a deer stand Sept. 30 in the Snores Community around 2:15 to 3:00 p.m. Perched in a tree, Swanner said he saw a ball up in the air which came across a nearby soybean field, passed in front of him, and sat downin an old road bed. At first it hovered approximately one foot from the ground and three legs unfolded from under the body forming a tripod. Swanner said the vehicle set two of the legs down on the ground in the outside wheeltrack of the old farm road and a third extended over the other wheel track line into a field some 18 inches. The object was perfectly round like a ball and glowed from within with a white florescent glow. As he looked, he could see no seams, portholes or any opening whatever, then to his amazement there sudden ly appeared in the body of the craft a door which seemed to come from nowhere. The door was approximately 3 ft. wide by 4 ft. high. It lowered, hinged at the bottom, to the ground forming a ramp. He heard BEEPS which he explained were unlike any BEEP sounds he had ever heard before. He described this sound as \"more like a high pitched crow call.\" Swanner said he had a cold and without thinking he sniffed his nose. With this, the door snapped shut, the tripod disappeared into the body of the UFO and it shot away at incredible speed. After the craft left, Swanner observed a fog of whitish vapor where it had rested. He crawled down from his perch and went to the landing site. Breathing his fog, he had a smothering sensation and felt as if his lungs were being pumped, full of air to (Continued on Page 4) ' f"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Fish Story    * In the December issue of SKYLOOK (page ll) we reported an unidentified submerged object in the Pascagoula River in Mississippi where the two fisherman were taken on board a strange space craft. . \\ The.

Bonn Tibbets, writer for the Manchester (N.H.) \"Union Leader\" said \"At first blush many persons might tend to discount the story as a 'wild tale.'\" However, Mrs. Lyndia Morel, who described the UFO as being a \"honeycombed object about the size of a car with orange and gold color with a high pitched whine or buzz,\" claimed \"my body went numb and it felt .like a magnet was pulling me to- ward it.\"     • Mr. and.Mrs. Normand Beaudoin, of North Mast Rd., Rte. 114, Goffstown, at whose home Mrs. Morel sought help said they also saw the UFO. \"She was really frightened and Ididn't believe her—that's impossible—she said it was trying\"to get her. .and then we went outside and really saw that thing,\" said Mrs. Beaudoin. Even the testimony of three persons might be easily dismissed by skeptics but there's more. Goffstown police patrolman, Daniel Jubinville, 23, responded at 4:35 a.m. to a report that a young woman had spotted a UFO on Rte. 114 and that her \"eyesight went blurry, her ears started .buzzing and it was as though this thing was sort of taking her over.\" ' • . . Patrolman Jubinville said he had to \"buy\" the story \"because I can't prove other- wise \" and \"I saw what she saw.\" \"when I got there I didn't believe in UFOs,\" he said, \"I'd never seen one before and when Mrs. Morel's husband asked me if I believed in UFOs I replied, I didn't. But stars just don't dance in the sky.\" Mrs. Morel,, of Parker Road, New Boston,, said she finished work at about 2:45 a.m. and went for a cup of coffee before driving home...  • \"As soon as I hit Pinardville, headed toward Goffstown I spotted something like a bright yellow star to my left but I didn't.think anything of it.\" \"When I reached the point in Mast Road, where it intersects with 114 at the County Farm I noticed it again and it was bright. I lit a cagarette and the object seemed to dim out.\" She said the UFO remained -to the left of her car as she drove but it \"dimmed right out as I passed through downtown Goffstown.\" Mrs. Morel said she took a left at the popcorn stand, a longtime Goffstown landmark and headed out what is known to residents as North Mast Rd. on Rte. 114. \"As I rode along it was now right in front of me and I started to get dizzy. . my whole body kinda numbed. . . as it came .closer I could see that it was honeycombed. . . orange and gold colored.\" . \"The orange color was sort^Fid,quid like the color of .orange juice and it was as if a magnet was pulling me,\" said Mrs. Morel. Panic stricken, she related, she drove her car onto the lawn of the home of Mr. and Mrs, Beaudoin and when their German Shepherd dog lunged toward her growling, Mrs. Morel said \"although I'm afraid of dogs I belted him with the back of my hand.\" \"I pounded on the door of the house and screamed as the object hovered over the back of the house and as soon as the man opened the door the feeling of awful buzzing and being.drawn left me,\" said Mrs. Morel in a sigh of relief, explaining that she had fallen to her knees and felt she was about to faint. She admitted the Baaudoins thought she was crazy, drunk or on drugs at first until they saw it for themselves. When the police responded to their call they were skept- ical too, said Mrs. Morel, until the officer said, \"Oh my God! There it is over the tree line—I don't believe it.\"  . Mrs. Beaudoin told the Manchester Union Leader the first thing she and her hus- band knew they were awakened from their sleep at 4:30 a.m. by \"pounding atthe door and the ringing of the bell by this woman and I thought she had flipped her lid for a minute. But we really did see it. \"At first it looked like a ball of fire with a blue haze around it. It kept moving 5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"back and forth,\" said Mrs. Beaudoin, who said when she tried to get a picture of it with a Polaroid camera \"all the lights on the thing went out, but when I put the camera down we saw it again.\" Later, she took a picture but it showed no evidence of the UFO. \"It was too far away,\" she explained. \"She was so scared and there she was hanging on to my husband and crying 'help me, help me' saying it was 'right above me trying to get me.' I didn't really be- lieve it but then we went out and really saw that thing,\" said Mrs. Beaudoin, who added that heretofore she didn 't believe in UFOs. Patrolman Jubinville said he had never responded to a UFO call before. \"I saw what she said she saw. It looked like an ordinary star. It did go out and it moved probably a foot and trarned colors, red, yellow and back to red.\" Jubinville allowed that \"it was an awfully strange star in that it didn't look like a flying saucer or anything like that.\" Outside of Mrs. Morel being shaken up by the incident, the patrolman said he was convinced that she was pretty rational. \"Oh, yes,\" he said. Robert Morel, 23, said he had worked overtime at a food firm in Nashua, but \"had a feeling something was wrong\" as he drove home and came upon his wife's car\"off\" Rte. 114 at the Beaudoin home where he saw the UFO. He said he'd like to see it again. Not Mrs. Morel—she wants to qu it any more night work because she frankly is scared stuff. She and her husband drove to her parents' h^me in Manchester where her 3-year old son, Carl, was staying. \"Tftank God he wasn't with me,\" she said. A native of Manchester and a graduate of Memorial High School as is her j husband, Mrs. Morel said that prior to yesterday \"I wondered about UFOs. I kinda believed in them but I never thought I'd see one. I think there was life on it. My eyes were for- ced to it and for a flash it seemed like I saw a figure or a body in it. I really thought it intended to make me away,\" said Mrs. Morel.   • Credit: Lucius Farish. Michigan Woman Sees UFO Mrs. Janet Fleischmann, 1111 W. Seymore Lake, Oxford, Michigan, has been appointed by Dr. J. Allen Hynek to be his coordinator for UFO sightings in the Oxford area, according to a recent article in the \"Oakland Press,\" Pontiac, Michigan. Mrs. Fleischmann and her daughter, Kelli, 7, saw an unidentified flying object right on their front lawn on Oct. 2k. Kelli told her mother to look up, and she saw the object above the apple tree in her neighbor's front yard. It was described as about 12 feet in diameter with red and white lights around the bottom. \"I wasn't frightened, I was stunned,\" she said. \"We sat in the driveway watching it for about three minutes. Then a smaller one came from the end of Tan Lake. It came right underneath and then they both went north west toward Granger Road,\" Mrs. Fleischmann said. She said other people in the neighborhood also observed the object. Since she has let it be known she wants to receive UFO reports, she has had some amazing ones. \"I was told of a man and his son going inside of a flying saucer which they thought was abandoned. They totally viewed the inside of this saucer and returned home. Later, this saucer vanished, much to their surprise.\" Others told of seeing a UFO landing and three people getting out of the-saucer onto the ice last winter at St. Ignace.

Mr. and Mrs. James Hasty, of Route 1, Russellville, say they first noticed the lights moving over their farmhouse in late October. Since then, they say there has been a nightly reappearance of the lights, including one that seems to emerge from the woods at the edge of the field about dusk. The light changes from a faint pinkish glow to a bright white light in about one hour, they claim. \"It seems like they are right outside in our back yard. It's scary, like maybe they are watching us to see how we live,\" Mrs. Hasty said. \"It was about a month ago when we first noticed the funny lights in the sky. They were low and seemed to revolve with red, blue and yellow colors. It wasn't until about two weeks ago, after watching the lights hover, blink and move across the sky, that the Hasty family had their first frightening encounter with the objects, they say. \"It was a Sunday night, we were leaving for church when a light like a big fall- ing st ar came out of the sky and dropped behind the back of our house,\" Mrs. Hasty said. Mrs. Hasty said her husband, a parts department manager at a Jefferson City auto dealer, told her \"not to worry that it was probably a shooting star.\" The next evening, Monday, Nov. 19, the Hasty family returned from a shopping trip to nearby Eldon when they saw a mysterious light in the field, they said. Hasty called Basil Amos, owner of the adjoining farm, to see if he was working in the field and was told \"there shou Idn't be any light there.\" Hasty and Amos met, then walked toward the light that appeared no more than 500 feet away, they said. But Hasty soon found his eyes playing tricks on him. The closer he got the farther away the object seemed he said. Both Hasty and his wife reported they seemed unusually irritable and aggravated with their children after the experience, almost as though they had no control over their emotions. On another occasion, Mrs. Hasty said she and her husband watched a bright red object move across the sky with a roaring sound. \"It seemed to have a greenish-blue tail traling from it. It made a roaring, clicking sound but it wasn't a helicopter or an airplane,\" she said. Mrs. Hasty said cattle begin to moan when the lights appear and the family's pet dog seems to sense something is wrong. \"One night my little girl came in and said she heard a lady screaming. It was one of the cows moaning like it was in pain the way they do when they give birth..The light was out in the field,\" she said. Last Friday evening, Hasty, Amos and a friend of the Hastys tried to approach the light from different directions but when they got near it, the light switched off, they say. \"My husband and the other men stay/ed out there about two hours; when they came back, both were shook up and scared,\" Mrs. Hasty said. \"I was with one of the men's wives about 10:30 (p.m.) when a bright white light moved across the field turning into a red, bluish and goldish colored object.\" Fearing for the safety of the men still in the field, Mrs. Hasty said, she drove the family station wagon toward the field with the lights on. \"It seemed to come toward me, so I jump ed. out of the car and ran back into the house,\" she said. The Hastys also have had trouble with their AM-FM stereo radio receiver since the lights began appearing. Fearing ridicule, the Hasty family was reluctant to tell the'Cole County Sheriff's Department about the lights. \"Now we're so frightened, we don't know what to do,\" she said.

Indiana From the Sept. 29, 1973 issue of \"The North Vernon Sun,\" North.Vernon, Indiana:— Well, if you don't believe in Unidentified Flying Objects, you might ask Duke Koenig who works at Connaughton Chevrolet and lives at 530 South State Street, about them. Wednesday night Duke was sitting on his front porch when he happened to look up to the Southwest and saw a flashing object about 2',500 feet in the air. He thought it was a star and looked away but when he looked back there it was flashing green, white and red lights. Duke said it was just hanging in one spot. He was looking at it between two light wires which were in front of the house and he sat there and watched it for about an hour. It only moved about two inches lower and did not move from side to side. Just stayed there. The \"thing\" didn't move and so Duke went inside for about 25 minutes and when he'came out it was gone. He walked around to the back of his house and stood in the alley and there it was moving west towards Seymour. When he saw it in front, he told his mother-in-law, Mrs. Richard Holmes, who was visiting from Carlyle, 111., about it and she really didn't pay much attention to it. Then when she saw it at the back of the house she really thought it was a UFO. Mrs. Holmes belongs to the Mutual UFO Organization so she is quite an authority on the subject. Mr. and Mrs. Don Engle who live next door to the Koenigs, Mr. Holmes, Duke-'-s wife, Faye, and their children all watched the object in the sky. As they saw it in the west it seemed much lower and brighter than it had when Duke first saw it in front of his house. He called the city police and officers John Lawler and Phil Owens, came up to take a look. They thought it was unexplainable. Officer Lawler came to my house /tac.ry Lee Cull, the writer/ and I drove over to see the \"thing.\" V.'ell, it was flashing red, white and green lights and it was moving slowly to the west. I know it was not ah airplane because they cannot hang in midair for an hour. I know it was something I had never seen before and I know we were all trying to think it couldn't be—but it sure was unidentifiable. About 9:10 p.m. a small aircraft was flying to the right of it and one could see the flashing strobe light on the plane. This was entirely different from UFO's. Just then we heard jets flying and they were to the right and to the left of the object only at a higher altitude. They were moving slowly enough that we could see the lights on the wings. Normally, you don't see this. You usually hear the sound and that's about all. State police said that someone in the Commiskey area had reported seeing what appeared to be a UFO that same evening. They also said they were reported to be seen in Johnson county. None of us will really say it was a UFO for positive—but none of us will say it wasn't. I know that normally, a group of people don't gather in the alley in our neighborhood at night and stare at the sky and wonder what the heck that thing in the sky is. Yes, I believe it was something I had never seen before, so does Duke, and the rest of the ones who saw it, and I wou Id bet a little money that the pilot of the small aircraft and the jets we saw were thinking the same thing.

But there was a follow-up story which stated that Duke Koenig received a call from \"a very reliable person\" who lives in Franklin, Ind., and he reported that he and his two daughters had seen the object. They watched it through binoculars and said the red, green and white lights were rotating around the object. A store owner in North Vernon told Koenig that hd and several of his customers had seen the object, and other reports were made."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Hopes Circle of Lights Will Attract UFO Twenty-two miles northwest of Austin, in the rugged Central Texas Hill Country, Project International Starlight and its originator, Ray Stanford, await an appear- ance from an unidentified flying object. Stanford's 100 ft. \"circle of lights\" sits on a rocky hillside and flashes its red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet lights, beckoning UFOs from as far out in space as 150 miles, according to Stanford. It is bizarre, to say the least, hundreds of wires emanating from a central control station, a second-hand record player turntable going round causing the lights to flash in sequence, somehow. Action at the control station becomes frenzied as Stanford discovers a number of the indigo lights not working. \"It must be a plug,\" he says, handing a spare to a co-worker, who makes the necessary repairs. As he works on the system, Stanford fields questions from the 15 newsmen allowed to view the apparatus for the first time Thursday night. The location of the project had been a secret fearing hordes of \"sightseers\" would scar e off any UFOs. When asked if he thinks people will say he is crazy, Stanford looks up and replies evenly, \"I don't believe anyone thinks I'm crazy, nearly 70 per cent of the people in this country believe in UFOs.\" Stanford says the Association for the Understanding of Man has put \"about $5,000 into the project but if the government did something like this, they would prob ably spend a million or so.\" Besides the lights, the project has a pendulum magnetic UFO \"detector\" which sets off an alarm if a UFO comes within a mile or so. Stanford says airplanes cannot set off the mechanism because itworks due to magnetic force fields and they have no mag- netic field. When asked what he will do if a UFO does appear, Stanford said, \"Well, I'm not going to run unless to go after my camera.\" Source: \"The Austin American,\" Austin, Texas, Oct. 19, 1973. Editor 's Note: Ray Stanford is a State Section Director for MUFON and has been actively engaged in investigating UFOs since 1953. In his lectures on UFOs. he presents a fascinating presentation of UFO facts and photographs, . collected from around the world and carefully checked for authenticity. Early in November Mr. Stanford appeared on a Kansas City radio talk show, speaking on UFOs and giving MUFON and SKYLOOK a plug — for two weeks following his talk we received new subscriptions from the Kansas City listening area, and they are still coming in alt ho at a slower rate. Many of the subscribers mentioned his lecture in glowing terms; so it's easy to understand why his speaking engagements always draw crowds. He recently spoke at the Moorehead State College in Minnesota and at S.M.U. in Dallas and will speak on radio and in public appearances in Austin, Texas this month. He wrote us: \"I had a UFO sighting on Oct. 22, 1973, at 8:09 p.m. with eight or nine witnesses at the site, but the movies taken was rather underexposed. So, we continue with hopes of something better.\" If you have a chance to hear him speak, don't miss it.

Reported by Paul Cerny Donald Hardin, 31, of Ponderosa Hills, and Guy Davis, 20, of Tuolumne, near Sonora, Calif., construction workers for Steve Mackey Construction Co., were on their way to work at 6:30 AM on Sept. 12, 1973. It was daylight, but the sun had not yet risen over the distant Sierra mountains to the east. About two miles east of Twain Harte on Highway 108, as they rounded a gradual curve and passed a group of pine trees, Hardin, who was driving the ''65 Chevy pickup, ob- served a large silvery disc object just hanging or hovering motionless and noise- less in the air over the canyon just off the highway to their right. The strange craft was only about 800 ft. away from them, appeared to be 75 to 100 feet in diameter and like two plates facing together. The object was at about a 35 degree angle in the sky from the observers, just above the tree top level. It was also tilted at an angle of about 30 degrees hovering perfectly as if suspended in space. It appeared to be slightly thicker at one end as compared to the other, but did appear to be of a definite \"double disc\" shape. It was glowing a slight golden-orange color around its extreme edge. No windows, other openings, or pro- trusions of any kind were noticed. The two men gazed at the object for about 20 seconds as they slowed down somewhat to look at it, but did not stop. As they passed a grove of trees again, shutting off their view, they continued on around a curve to the next clear spot overlooking the canyon and pulled over to stop for a better look. At this location however, they could not observe the craft for the trees in the way; or as they later stated, it possibly moved out of sight from where it was first seen. Not wanting to be late for work, they continued on up the highway. Two other witnesses also reported seeing the same object. Teacher and Students See UFO As Large As A Small House On Oct. 19, 1973, at about 10:30 PM, a teacher (who prefers to remain anonymous) and eight teenagers returning home to Point Arena, California from a drama work- shop, observed a very bright orange-yellow, round object about the size of a small house only 100 feet or less from the edge of the road as they drove north along Highway No. 1 approaching Point Arena. The teacher said as they bottomed out down hill into the gulley and started up hill again, the object just suddenly \"turned on\" like a gigantic light out in the meadow opposite them. It was described as just a large bright, fuzzy, yellow light, and appeared to be resting on the ground only 75 to 100 feet away. It was in the shape of a ball or sphere. Coming down the hill toward the area they saw nothing at the spot as the night was pitch black and overcast. As they passed the bottom part of the gulley, the object \"turned on\" startling everyone in the car. By the time the teacher began to slow down, stop the car and take a look back, they were about 400 feet up the next hill. At this moment, the object rose up from the meadow and over the cypress trees. Everyone in the car was looking out the rear window and as the UFO rose up off the ground, the teacher started on down the road toward Point Arena at a fast rate. At this point several of the teenagers became frightened and one girl started to cry. They could see the UFO following their car now, but in a few moments it veered off and headed out toward the ocean. At no time during the experience was there any sound that could be heard from the object. The teacher hastily drove pn to Point Arena where he dropped one boy off, then after calming the rest of the kids down, started back to Gualala (a small coastal town about 50 miles south • of Fort Bragg in northern California). As they came to the crest of the same hill, they stopped, as the object was there again, only on the east side ofthe road and more distant. Some of the kids were so scared, they did not want to go by the UFO again. The teacher returned next day to the spot where they had seen the UFO. There was 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"a definite round discoloration spot in the meadow where it had been. Investigating the area on foot, he did discover one hoi* in the ground, but said he thought it could have been a gopher or other animal hole. Coast Guard personnel at the nearby LORAN Station had seen UFOs in the area a number of times and had taken photographs of them. MUFON representatives are attempting to obtain copies of these photos. It was learned that quite a number of local people had been observ- ing the \"intruders.\" The teacher talked to Ruth Parker, who stated that she watched a yellow-orange sphere the same morning as the teacher's sighting, at about 6:30 AM for 22 minutes, moving in the sky all around the area. The teacher talked to another couple who saw the same UFO 15 minutes before he and the teenagers saw the object. At that earlier period, itappeared to be out over the ocean. Reported by Paul Cerny, MUFON State Director for Northern California. UFO Seen Over Football Game in California Mrs. Jean.Cleveland, editor of the Twain Harte \"Daily News,\" near Sonora, Calif., was at a night football game in Sonora Sept. 14, 1973. For some reason, during the excitement of the game, she glanced upward and saw a pale orange, glowing oval shaped object, about half the size of the full moon. It was at about a 60 degree elevation and gave off a constant glow, not too bright, but with two brighter spots quite obviously near its center. Mrs. Cleveland, who stated she is a trained observer with perfect eyesight, watched the object for a minute or perhaps more, until it suddenly shot upward and to the east, disappearing in two seconds. She did not learn if others at the game also saw the object, but assumed all were prob- ably .watching the action on the field. Reported by Paul Cerny. More Sightings in Monterey, California Three residents of an apartment bu ilding at 316 Van Buren St., Monterey-, reported sighting what appeared to be several formations of unidentified flying objects passing;over the city Saturday night, police reported today. Police said Christopher P. Aune, 19, of Apartment 7, and Gerald A. Culver 26, and Debra Lee Culver, 18, of Apartment 9, reported seeing objects in the sky at about 10 p.m. Saturday. They described them as egg-shaped with winglike protuberances on the sides, glowing or burning with a blue-green light, flying from south to north over the coastline in V-shaped formation of four to eight objects per group. The three counted eight groups flying about 10 minutes apart in the same direct- ion, crossing the horizon in three to five seconds, police said. Source: \"Monterey Peninsula Herald.\" Credit: L. Hern. Woman Is Frightened By Large, Bright Object On Oct. 26, 1973, Mrs. Jones (not her real name) called Mrs. Ann Druffel to report an object which had awed and frightened her the previous evening. Mrs. Jones lives in Wrightwood, Calif., a mountain community of 2,000 persons. Her cabin is at the 6,100 foot level. She had gone to visit a neighbor a short distance from her home and was returning sometime between 6:30 and 6:50 p.m. Facing south, she was startled by a very large, bright white light which was hovering diredyly over a mountain peak about one mile away. She described this mountain as being \"bare-faced\" from many land slides, but having a series of trees on the rim which have not yet slid down the' slope. As she watched the bright light for about lg minutes, \"it descended slowly like the sun, lighting up the trees from behind, silhouetting them like black cut .outs.'J The object set slowly, finally leaving the very tip of the light, then it disappeared behind the mountain, leaving an after glow like the sunset. She compared to the light to Jupiter, saying it was about 2| times the size of that planet (Jupiter at that time being -1.8 magnitude). When questioned further, she said that the light at no time actually lit up the 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"tops of the trees, nor did it light up the branches as it set behind them. She called out to her neighbors, but they did not come out until after the object was out of sight. However, the neighbor's 14-year old son saw the object from the bathroom window while he was taking a shower, and described it as she had seen it. Mrs. Jones called the sheriffs' substation who contacted the main Victorville station and it was learned that at least one sighting per night had been reported there during the past week. Mrs. Jones, who gave an impression of being reliable and stable, said she cannot understand herself how the object frightened her so, but reported the fear because it was a real part of her experience. The deputy sheriff who came out to see her after her report told her there is an isolated valley beyond the mountain. An old road winds around the mountain, but when the deputy attempted to get over the mountain into the valley he found the road blocked by slides. Reported by Ann Druffel. Alarm Bleeps With UFO's Blip Dec. 5, 1973, La Selva Beach, Cal.—A housewife has reported that an unidentified flying object hovered over her house with pulsating lights blinking on and off—and the temperature alarm onher freezer kept time with the blinking lights. The housewife, who requested that her name be withheld, called sheriff's deputies, who went to her house, verified the pulsating alarm and saw the UFO with its blink- ing lights. They phoned the duty officer at the sheriff's office and let him listen on the phone to the alarm. ..The housewife's son reportedly was awakened first by the alarm, which is a temperature warning signal connected to a freezer in the downstairs part of the house to warn when the temperature rises too high in the freezer. The alarm reportedly went off Wednesday night with a rhythmic sound and both the housewife and her son saw an object going across the sky out over Monterey Bay. \"It went across the sky and then came again,\" said the son. \"It was real strange.\" He said they saw \"one like it\" about two weeks ago. After sheriff's deputies -and the La Selva Beach family had watched the object for some time, it sailed away. Another housewife reported spotting several objects with blinking lights which were visible over the bay a couple weeks ago. At that time two sheriff's deputies went to the scene and observed the unidentified flying object. Source: \"The Mercury,\" San Jose, Calif., Dec. 7, 1973.

As of this writing, I have recorded 826 reports involving only events reported in this country, with 80$ taking place during September and October. 85 of the 826 cases^were in Missouri. On Sept. 14 two military policemen from Fort Leonard Wood observed a red- orange sphere within 100 feet oftheir vehicle. The object was just above the trees and paced them for about a half mile before turning sharply to disappear in the distance. Sept. 15 a family near Lamonte observed a large glowing oval near the ground. The glow lit up the house and the object was seen for several minutes. Sept. 22 a large oval light mass was seen lg miles north of Sedalia at about 1:00 AM by two witnesses as it hovered near their home. The object was just above nearby trees and remained stationary for several minutes. It glowed with a blue- white light; the base changed colors during the observation. The following morn- ing a, neighbor reported that she and her husband had also seen the object from their home a short distance away. Oct. 3 a couple reported seeing what at first appeared to be a meteor descend- ling^in the south at high speed. The object was red-orange and suddenly slowed, hovered for a very brief time and ascended vertically at high speed. As it as- •cended.a red halo formed around it. There was no sound. Oct. 11, Springfield, a high pitched whistling sound was heard by several people and the: dogs in the area were barking loudly. No object seen. The following morn- ing a ring 7 feet in diameter was found in a driveway between two houses. All of. the gravel was removed. ; 0ct. 15, two women were driving near Jefferson City at about 10 AM when they saw a -silvery..disc in the east. The sky was clear and the object appeared to be .several times the diameter of the full moon. No surface details., were visible. They watched the disc for about 6 minutes before it moved southeast at high speed. Oct. 1-6, near the Lake of the Ozarks, two men driving to work saw a brilliant circular light hovering in the east at about 5:30 AM. They watched the light for.several minutes before it suddenly ascended vertically and disappeared. Oct. 31, near Smithton, 8 people watched three silvery discs in the west at about 5:45 PM. The discs were larger than stars and above a cloud layer. Two of the objects descended into the cloud cover and a few seconds later the third moved away to the west. Photographs were taken of the object. Oct. 31 j Kansas City,several people saw five silver discs overhead at about 10 AM. As the object flew over, a white material was seen falling to the ground. The witnesses obtained several samples and have promised to send them for analysis. UFO Over Salem. Mo, — Four Salem residents report seeing an unidentified flying object Friday evening between 8:30 and 9 o*clock over Salem* Dr. and Mrs. Lawrence Green were visiting Mr. and Mrs. John Schultz in the Brandon Heights Subdivision when Mrs. Green spotted a bright red glow outside the living room window.

Fawcett, 60? N. Main St., Mt. Airy, N.C. Despite a mall number of hoaxes (fake photos, over consumption of alcohol, plastic laundry bags with candles) and misinterpretations (planets, stars, satellites, meteors, parachute flares, Quality Mill's water tower, airplances etc) many of the October and fjovember 1973 UFO sightings in Mount Airy and throughout Surry County remain unsolved after close investigation and evaluation. Also, unknown to many, UFO encounters during this same period of time were reported from all 50-states and over 40 countries overseas. Most fascinating of all the fantastic happenings in this area were the reports of UFO occupants on three occasions, one in Mount Airy, one in Copeland and one in Dobson. . . these paralled similar reports from Gaffney, S. C.; Pascagoula, Miss.; Falkville, Ala.; Athens, Ga.; Robesonia, Pa. Kimbra, Australia and Danville, Va. during 1973—just to mention a few. The earliest report (delayed 5 years before permission was granted to use the witnesses name) was reported by Mrs. Harold B. Eggers on the Buck Shoals Road, Mount Airy in July or August of 1968. Krs. Eggers related that she saw a small UFO occupant, dressed in some sort of a silver suit outfit complete with a helmet, who looked at her through one of the windows of a hovering UFO. The UFO was es- timated to be 15 feet wide and 6 feet high. During its appearance Mrs. Eggers 1 dog was severely agitated, the UFO made a sound \"like a huge swarm of bees\" and a power failure occurred in the immediate neighborhood, where the UFO maneuvered for almost an hour starting at 2:30 a.m. Three of the electric clocks in Mrs. Eggers' home registered a loss of time the following morning after the incident. Next came a report by Mr. and Mrs. David A. Doby of Copeland who. encountered a large bluish oval-shaped UFO hovering near theirmobile home at 7:45 p.m. as they left to- attend a football game on October 19. While watching the hovering UFO overhead David was startled by the screams of his wife who suddenly saw a small three-foot creature in her front yard. This occupant was dressed in a golden metallic suit from head to foot. The couple piled into their automobile and fled their farm with their young son. The farm couple refused to return to their mobile home that night, but spent the night instead with Mr. and Mrs. George Doby. Their family dog also fled the farm to return the next day. Another 1973 encounter was reported by David Simpson of Dobson on October 24 at 9 p.m. David Simpson, while driving down U. S. 601 reported that his car engine and headlights suddenly stopped when, an \"oval shaped UFO, about 12 feet wide and 8 feet high\" landed near his car. Simpson fainted when he saw a creature with eyes \"like balls of fire\" that peered through his window. Finally upon the departure of the UFO and its occupant his car lights and engine started running again without Simpson having to touch his ignition switch and the badly frightened motorist resumed his journey to Mount Airy. He did not report his experience for several days for fear of ridicule. Other unexplained incidents included reports from almost 100 cities and towns in North Caroline during this period of time. Many reports of EM effects on police radar, and CB radios and neighorhood TV and radio were also reported. Many are still under investigation. Bad Luck Follows Occupant Report The average person, interested in UFOs, wishes he could see one and figures seeing an occupant too would be a bonus. This wasn't true in the case of Jeff Greenhaw, Falkville, Ala., police chief. A little more than a month after he photographed what he 'believes to be a silver-suited creature from outer space, he lost his automobile, his home and his wife.. His car blew up on Oct. 21; his wife left him; and his mobile home was destroyed by fire. He says he feels someone or something wants him to leave town; but he has made up his mind to stay.

It is entitled THE GOLD OF THE GODS and tells of the author's travels to far-flung parts of the world in search of evidence for his \"ancient astronauts\" theory. As always, there are numerous items of interest in the new book, even if some of the material might cause you to begin looking for a convenient salt-shaker. Perhaps the most controversial portion of the material is that dealing with the alleged \"underground library\" in Ecuador, which von Daniken claims was\" left by the \"gods\" from space. The discoverer of the site claims von Daniken was never inside, the \"library\"; von Daniken, in turn, .says the Ecuadorian is a liar. So, you pays your money . . .The basic theory espoused by von Daniken is probably well worth pursuing, so I continue to recommend all his books to all who don't mind doing a little mental sorting out while they read. The book is available from G. P. Putnam's Sons, 200 Madison Ave., N. Y., N. Y. 10016 for $6.95. And, in '74, look for the fourth von Daniken book, IN SEARCH OF THE GODS.

You'll find all the standard Keyhoe topics—AF bungling, CIA involvement, the Condon Report, the 1965 blackout, etc. I consider it quite unfortunate that the author's attitude toward the occupant cases is still largely one of ridicule. As one of the true pioneers of Ufology, Keyhoe should have long since learned to face the fact s. He also proposes an \"Operation Lure\" which is designed to bring the UFOnauts down to Earth so we can talk to them. To me, the whole concept is silly and gives the supposed extraterrestrials no credit for having any common sense. For $7.95 you can share Keyhoe's current view of Ufology.

Piedmont. Mo.. April 7, 1973. Ben Baron, 21 Oak Park Drive, St. Louis, saw a luminous object about the size of a medicine ball, high in the sky over the city dump about 10 P.M. It appeared briefly, then \"went out.\" Reported to C. E. Falmberg. LaMotte. Mo. . April, 1973. Eva Jane Siinrns, Route 1, Farmington, Mo., a school teacher, with another witness, also a teacher, saw two bright lights hovering overhead in a clear sky with only a few scattered clouds. The time was 6:50 PM and the two watched the bright object from their car for about five minutes, then went on to the school where they teach to attend a Board meeting. Just before they reached the school, the ob- ject moved directly toward them.. Frightened, they left the car and ran inside the school. One of the Board members said he had seen the object and believed it to be a plane.Miss Simms is positive it was not. Reported to William Christian. St. Charles. Mo., May 2, 1973. Mr. \"X\" looked from his bedroom window at 2 AM tosee a bright object, the size of a basketball. A yellow-white in color, it moved back and forth between two points, with no change in color or appearance. Mr. X, who is familiar with planes, states the bright object was not a plane. Reported to John F. Schuessler. Piedmont. 'Mo.. June 23. 1973. W. L. Harrington, 1027 Ford Drive, Fer- guson, Mo., was at the Rothwell Ranch near Piedmont when he saw a light lying low on the east-southeast horizon in a clear sky. There was no moon. When the object began to move, Harrington awakened his son, and both watched the object for approximately 30 minutes. The light, chang- ing from red to white at irregular time intervals, appeared to radiate lines in concentric circles, similar in appearance to heat waves rising from a highway on a hot day. The ring around the object was similar to the ring around Saturn. At one point a very small light rose to join the object which moved to the north, covering about 15 degrees in the 30 minutes. Reported to Dan A. Rothwell. St. Charles. Mo.. June 13. 1973 Reuben Abbington, 1007 Pine St., St. Charles, Mo., a police officer, received a call from the Police Dispatcher, at 10 40 PM to investigate a UFO report from the Chargene and Charann area. The sky was overcast and a light rain fell later. On reaching the scene of the report, Abbington saw a brightly glowing ob- ject in the east. It hovered, made 90 degree turns and moved \"with the speed of lighting\" and was joined by another bright object. The two seemed to play a game of tag in the sky, making unbelievable turns at great speed, but never colliding. They darted about a plane in the area. On calling the Tower at Lambert Airport, it was learned the plane was seen on radar, but the two objects were not. A third object joined the two and all were seen by several witnesses. Abbington last saw the objects in the northwest, as he,-had to leave the area because of patrol duty. The objects darted in and out of the clouds during the period of observation and were bright enough to be observed through the overcast. First seen at an angle of 90 degrees above the horizon, they were 45 degrees when last noted. Reported to Clifford E. Falmberg. Florissant. Mo. July 11. 1973 At 9:45 PM Herman J. Musing, 2650 Delaware Drive, Florissant, was on Highway 140 near New Halls Ferry when he saw a very bright object at approximately 30 degrees elevation moving from west to east, then to the southeast at a diminishing eleva- tion angle.

On its second appearance Girresch called to his son, inside a tent, and he saw the object. The \"white fire- ball\" was much larger than any of the planets in view. Reported to John F. Schuessler. Mt. Pleasant, la. Aug. 15. 1973 John Haynes, 700 S. 7th, Fairfield, la. was on Highway 34, west of Mt. Pleasant, at 2:15 AM, when his atten- tion was caught by the erratic, movement of an object between two layers of clouds. Orange in color and \"about the- size of a star,\" it moved from north to south, much as a falling leaf. Haynes drove in excess of 75 MFH but could come no closer to the object ahead and finally lost it in a cloud bank. It was in view about 15 minutes. Reported to Donald Campbell. St. Louis, Mo., Sept. 11, 1973 Ronald Allen, 1004 Tann Ave., St. Louis, was at 4304 Wabash visiting a friend at 8:10 PM when he looked up from ,the front porch and saw a round, orange glowing (like hot metal) object moving from south to north at a high rate of speed. Heavy clouds were building up in the west, but the object was higher than the clouds and ahead of them. Reported to John F. Schuessler. Note: Skylab was visible from 8:01 to 8:09 PM, moving from northwest to the southeast. Hazelwood. Mo. Sept. 12. 1973 Fearlee Whyman, 7447 Sir Lords Lane, Hazelwood, Mo., was driving on Olive Street Road at Highway 244 when she saw a man in a jeep parked on one side of the highway looking at a sky object outlined in a floodlight. The object had flashing red, white and green lights outlining its circular form and the \"floodlight\" on the forward portion illuminated the ground. The object hovered 400- 500 feet above the earth, and no sound was heard. The sky was clear, and the time was 11:55 P.M. The object was in view about 3 minutes. Reported to Marvin H. Whyman. Brea. California. Aug. 23. 1973. William J. Hornaday, Research Engi- ne erV3lT^TTalIr^TT^Tr7~~BreaT'''arifornia, watched a bright, orange light for 25-minutes. The object was first seen in the western sky at at angle of about 65 degrees above the horison. The object had the appearance of Mars and was of a visual magnitude of -2. The object moved very slowly 8-10 minutes, with some fluctuations in brightness, then be- came stationary near Vega and Lyra. Telescopic examination with a 4 inch, f/3 refractor operating at 40 power showed an elliptical shape with four white lights below in a diamond configuration. The object was ..not an air- craft, balloon or other identifiable object. Mrs. Hornaday also saw the object and watched it disappear by moving rapidly away while her husband was awakening a neighbor. During the observation there was no air traffic, but just before the object disappeared there was a great deal of activity in the area. Reported by Mr. Hornaday. A report was also made to the Press. Florissant. Ma.. Oct. 19, 1973 Ron Hanson, 275 Maple Drive, Florissant, Mo., watched an object about 30 degrees above the eastern horizen for about 30 minutes. Observed through binoculars, green and red lights could be seen. There was no noise, and Hanson is positive the object was not a plane or helicopter as it remained in a hovering position too long. He looked for the object at the same time (11 FM) the following night, and it was not there. Reported to John F. Schuessler. We like this cartoon sent in by Bruce Greeribautn.

Dr. W. P. Armstrong and John F. Schuessler related a resume of the paper presented by Dr. Harley D. Rubledge at the Nov. 17th meeting of the American Association of Physics Teachers. The paper concerned observations of anomalous lights in. southeastern Missouri, and both Dr. Armstrong and Mr. Schuessler agreed that Dr. Rutledge's findings were impressive. As part of his monthly Radio Net report, Dr. Armstrong played a 15-minute re- cording of the conversation conducted Dec. 1st. Topics under discussion included a recent Gallup poll which reported that 15 million Americans believe they have seen a UFO, and Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe's new book, Aliens from Space. Leo Wicklinski told of a personal observation of a daylight disc on the after- noon of Nov. 10 in St. Louis county. The object was apparently a considerable distance away, and was in view less than a minute. Other observers present preferred to remain anonymous. John Schuessler related an account of Edward F. O'Herin's interview with truck driver Eddie Doyle Webb, and discussed several factors (e.g., that Webb wanted no publicity, expenses required for medial attention etc.) which would seem to argue against a hoax interpretation of the October 3 incident. Clarence Dargie reported that he is investigating a case from the mid-1960s which involves two unusually clear photographs of a daylight disc. Further information will be given at a future meeting. Rosetta Holmes related a summary of her recent trip through several southern states and reported hearing many radio and TV programs featuring discussion of UFOs. (Reported by David A. Schroth) John F. Schuessler, Director of the St. Louis study group, has been asked to teach an evening class at the Metropolitan College of St. Louis University. The course on UFOs will begin Jan. 29 and will be held every Tuesday night, 7 to 9 PM. This is a first for the St. Louis area, and the school is very fortunate in ob- taining Mr. Schuessler. Mr. Schuessler spoke on UFOs to the St. Pet ers, Mo. Jajcees Dec. 3, and will address the Green Trails Methodist Church Couples Club in St. Louis County Dec. 7. George Pelizzari. 211 Rockwood Ave., Dayton, Ohio, has his license for his C. B. radio and his call letters are KFY-5139. On Wednesday night, Dec. 19, at 8 p.m. George Fawcett presented his 2g hour lecture \"UFOs—Still Unknown\" in the Love Auditorium at Davidson College in Davidson, N. C. for faculty, students and townsfolks, sponsored by the Co-Curriculum Committee of the College Union. The Nov. 30 issue of the \"Independent Coast Observer,\" Gualala, California, had a fine article about Paul Cerny. Northern California State Director for MUFON, in- cluding his photo and information re MUFON. Mr. Cerny and Mrs. Idabel Epperson. Southern California State Director for MUFON, are being swamped with UFO reports and are doing their best to keep up with them. As a direct result of their work (and others in their group) SKYLOOK circulation in their state is increasing rapidly and we know the new editor will appreciate their cooperation and support just as much as we do.—Ye Ed.
