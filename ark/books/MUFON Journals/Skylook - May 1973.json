By Walt Andrus A continuous series of UFO reports, starting on February 21, 1973, when Coach Reggie Bone and five youths from his basketball team saw an unusual.arrangement of colored lights performing erratically, was the initial stimulus thot has grown to \"flap\" proportions in the news media. Based upon the world-wide coverage of these incidents in the press, it has been, without a doubt, the most publicized series of current UFO sightings to attract the wire services and news media outlets. A mult- iple-witness case was the kick-off to a steady rash of reports that followed nightly-as many of the 1906 citizens of Piedmont, Missouri, scanned the skies from vantage points around this picturesque resort town in hopes of viewing one of the elusive UFO ! s. Due to the clamor of the populace and press, State Representative Jerry T. Howard (Dem.) Piedmont, invited Dr. J. *llen Hynek, Chairman of Northwestern 1 s Astronomy Department, and a consultant on UFO's for the Air Force for over 20 yeers, and Ted Phillips, Sedalis, Missouri. Stete-Section Director and Secretary of the Midwest UFO.Network IMUFON) to Piedmont to investigate. Concurrent with this visit on Mtrch 31 and April 1, 1973, Kdwerd G'Herin, New Madrid, Missouri, MUFON otete-Section Director for southeastern Missouri; Hobert Kewney, Wuincy, Illinois, Chairman of the Tri-State UFO Study Group; and Walter H. Andrus, Jr., Director of the Midwest UFO Network joined Dr. Hynek and Ted Phillips in Piedmont for a week-end of interviews and investigations. In anticipation of the team of investigators headed by Dr. Hynek and in the interest of interviewing as many people as possible, Coach Reggie Bone had arranged for a substantial number of the witnesses to meet at his home to conserve time, ^ach of the observers reported what they had viewed some time during the past month as it is related to possible UFO's in the area, starting with Reggie Bone and concluding with one of his basketball ployers, Gary Barks. The observation by Reggie Bone and nis athletes in the Brushy Creek area was classified as a UFO, but would be categorized as \"nocturnal lights\" within approximately 200 yards. The team of investigators is deeply indebted for the gracious hos- pitality displayed by the following people who accompanied us on nearly every visit: Police Chief Gene Bearden; Mayor Joun Anderson; Dennis Hovis, i-isnager of Radio Station KPWB; Harold ^llinghouse, Reporter for the Piedmont newspaper; Dennis Keeney, announcer for KPtoB, and Jerry Howard. 'Ihe late afternoon was spent in the home of ^rs. Ma-ude Jefferis studying photographs that she and Gary button, a student, had made. V<e were unable to come to any conclusions on the pictures made by Gary, since he was not available to answer some very pertinent questions. After studying the original print made by Mrs. Jefferis of the gyroscope shaped object that was published in numerous newspapers, the source of the light for the \"lens flare\" was readily apparent, ^oth St. Louis newspapers had \"cropped\" the mercury vapor yard light from the left side of the photograph before publishing it. The star trails for the ten minute exposure in f.rs. Jefferis 1 photograph are consistent in her photograph. As a means of determining the validity of the gyroscope shaped object as a possible UFO, Mrs. Jefferis very generously conducted an experiment to duplicate the exact conditions under which the original photograph was made while the team was present. Two separate exposures of ten and twenty minutes were rntde of the attractive landscaping, pond, and over- cast sky from the original camera location on her patio. After being developed by Mrs. Jefferis in her own darkroom, both negatives displayed the same gyroscope shaped disc in the upper right corner. 'J-hese two photographs displayed no star trails due to the cloudy overcast, and no UFO's were observed by anyone present during the two exposures. Thus, 3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"this was satisfactory evidence that the original must have also been a \"lens flare.\" Prior to darkness, several vantage viewing points, where reports have originated, were visited so that the team members would have a good idea of the locations of hills, valleys, bodies of water and roads. During this trek into the hills near Piedmont, other witnesses were interviewed. A bright light was observed beyond a pond on a farmer's property by multiple witnesses after being alerted by citi- zen band radio communications from the two original witnesses. The observation was made with an overcast sky and mist precipitation, elimin- ating the possibility of of the object being a star. These gentlemen refused to have their interview recorded and would not permit their names to be used in the press. The only daylight sighting reported was that of two young men, Ron Miller, Piedmont, and Joe King, Brushy Creek. Three oi' us went to Ron Killer's house on Sunday morning, but he was not at home. «e were un- able to interview either, but did hear their recorded interview made by Dennis Hovis. After making a verbal statement of our findings to Jerry Howard, John Anderson, and to the news media via Dennis Hovis and Harold Ellinghouse, Ted Phillips drove Dr. Hynek back to the St. Louis airport, and the wuincy team journeyed to ^rand Tower and Mur- physboro to interview Oscar Wills. Alter the delightful hospitality ol' everyone in Piedmont, the most difficult job laced by the team was: \"What do you tell a community of wonderful people that have been exploited by a T self-appointed UFO expert' and have been engrossed in world-wide publicity from all angles —Thet this was not \"the most well documented case in UFO history 11 ? This is not to say that there were no UFO's observed in Piedmont. On the contrary: there were enough legitimate sightings mixed in to keep the stimulus alive for nearly two months. When the local people and visitors sit out every night scanning the sky, hoping to see one of these elusive UFO's, statistically there are bound to be objects observed which the viewer is unable to explain. The MUFON tesm visited these locations Saturday night and found each well attended, even though an overcast sky blotted out the stars and light rain was falling. Those of us who are anxious to resolve the UFO phenomenon through scientific study, recognize the positive aspects of the Piedmont sight- ings in keeping the subject before the scientii'ic community via the news media. ±t proves beyond a question of a doubt that the majority of the people on Planet .harth ere still interested in UFO's in the press. Editor's Note: We received newspaper clippings of the Piedmont sightings from ell over the u nited States and one from overseas, and we wish to thank all who sent them. Space doesn't permit listing all the names. Jig city dailies sent their own reporters to Piedmont and carried full page spreads with pictures of the observers.

Wills wes on duty inside the station when another employee, Willis Hughes, a turbine operator, telephoned from his home in Grand Tower to ask Wills to check on something that was hovering, over or near the . station's 66,000-volt transformer yard. Wills, an employee of the company for 30 years, went out the north door of the power generating station and immediately saw an object approximately 1,500 feet high over the yard. The distance from the building to the fence surrounding this particular transformer bank is 250 yards and his estimate of the height of the object was based on the known height of the smoke stacks at the power plant end the bluff directly next to the plant. He estimated the object to be 25 feet in diameter. n e described the object as a ring of lighted panels or windows with definite spacing between windows, each emitting pulsating light varying from a dark red-to-orange-to-white sequenced in a clockwise rotation like a theater marquee, ^he pulsations gave the impression the object was spinning clockwise, but the window separators remained stationary. Wills said the object was doughnut shaped, or more like a wide wedding band, since only the lighted panels were visible. The time wes 9:15 P.M. and the sky was clear with stsrs visible. He had the impression that if the object was a solid structure, the bottom was concave, since nothing wes visibly illuminated from the outer lights as ne observed it directly over his head on two occasions. Wills walked to within 150 yards of the transformer bank, viewing the object with great curiosity. Then he became a little apprehensive and decided to return to the Power Plent and ask two other employees on duty to come out to witness the phenomenon. As he turned to retrace his steps, the object which had been hovering directly over the transformer bank, started moving directly toward him, and passed over his head.As the object darted noiselessly past the north- west corner of the building, he lost sight of it for a moment as the Plant builing obstructed his viewing, area. He walked rapidly around to the west side of the Plant, facing the t-iississippi River, and noted the object was now hovering directly over the middle (No. 2) of the three water pump- ing station buildings. n e walked up the ramp to the pump station house and on to the sea wall protecting the Plant frcrn the river. n e was now a^ain directly under the hovering object. he told Walter H. Andrus, MUFON Director and Robert Kewney, Chairman of the Tri-State UFO Study Group, in the interview fromwhich this report is written that it would take a circular object 4i to 5 feet in diameter held at arms length to cover tne object at this point of observation. After watching for 7 to 8 minutes, the public address system operator called Wills back to the telephone within the Plant. It was Willis Hughes, who wanted to know what ^scar could see from his vantage point. Wills cut the conversation short so he and the other two men on duty could go out- side to view the object. When they went out the west door near the pumping stations, the lighted object was nowhere in sight. Wills remained outside, hoping for another view of the object, while the other two men went back inside. In about 25 or 30 minutes three or four jet aircraft (model unknown) made 8 or 10 sweeps across the Power Plant spaced about 2-3 minutes apart. The investi- gators hsve been uneble to lesrn if the planes were from ^cott Air ^'orce Base and if \"they were looking for something.\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"On being notified, Company engineers from Springf ield, 111., immed- iately consulted all of the automatically recorded cherts from each generator et the t'lant to determine if there were any voltage or output fluctuations at the tine of the observation. rt one were found arid no power outages vvere reported from the areas served by this particular Plant. Willis H U £hes end his family were also interviewed. The lighted object had first been sighted by Phyllis, 13, who called her mother's attention to flashing red lights in the northern sky. A 'hey wstcned a few minutes, then called Mr. Hughes. ^e said at first it looked like severs! lights, but through binoculars it looked like a large globe of light. It had a white or amber light glow- ing continuously elong witn the red. lA e saw a green light once during the observation, 'J-he lights were brighter than any aircraft lights he had seen. When the cluster, or globe, moved toward the Power Plant snd remained stationary, ^ughes telephoned Oscsr Vvilla. It was 9:15 P.M. he then telephoned his son, hillis Hughes, Jr., in Grand Tower, so he and his wife could watch the object and they, along with two guests, also stepped outside to watch the object, making a total of seven known witnesses, Hughes became impatient and called Wills the second time and this is the call that brought Wills back into the Plant and prevented him from seeing the departure of the object. Hughes continued to watch as the cluster of lights moved across the river to Tov/er Rock in Missouri. H e said the light disappeared going northwesterly. Kr. Andrus concludes; \"It is the sincere impression of this investi- gator that ^scar .Wills definite!'- observed an object that may be classi- fied as a UFU and from a reasonably close range (1,500 ft.) based upon my investigation of the tot el case.\" L ditor's Note: Thanks, also to ^rs.

A UFO has been sighted in the skies over Bernie, a small town about 40 miles southeast of Piedmont, end has been seen several times by rep- utable cizens. The strange, eerie light changes colors from white to red to green end to varying shades of color in btween, moves slowly and stead- ily across the heevens. One who saw the object is Norman Swafford , well-known professional photographer with military flying experience, who took pictures of the bright light in the sky and is convinced that \"There is something up there.\" The object moves in an irregular manner, stopping and starting, and changing speed, apparently at about 9,000 feet in the air snd noiseless. i-iany have seen the object, including police officers, the county sheriff, and farmers. Several farmers reported they thought the \"thing had landed, or tried to lend\" on their fields. \"J-t seems strange to me,\" one observer said, \"that the object would begin to appear in Bernie at just about the time that it seems to have disappeared from the skies near Piedmont.\" Sw^fford is trying to make arrangements to secure the services of a much larger camera—the type that will \"get a good, close up pnotograph of whatever is up there.\" Just es the UK)s fat Piedmont were usually spotted between 10 snd 11 p.m., tne san.e situation seems to hold true c-t riernie. Swefford said that tne fact thct ti.e object is never seen on a cloudy or hazy night would discount the idea that the object could be a reflection of ground lights off the clouds.

Three young men—Scott Aaland, A-751 Larkwood Drive, IS, and Chris Brekke, 4501 San *eliciano Drive, 19, both of Woodland Hills,Calif., and Joe Cavaretta, of 6510 Shoup Ave., Canoga Park, Calif., 13, were walking along the beach at Point Dume at 3:30 a. m. and had just moved up to higher ground and were standing on a plateau and looking toward the Santa Monica Mountains when suddenly they saw \"this light, a kind of shining, yellowish light—like a big headlight on a car—just hanging there in the sky\" above the mouth of the Malibu Canyon. \"It was sphere-shaped and just staying there, not moving. We watched for maybe 15 Minutes,\"Cavaretta told Hazlett. \"Then it started to move. You could hear the sound of low-pitched jet engines, not really revved up—just a sort of whooshing sound,\" he said. The object moved slowly out of the shadow of the mountains and turned right, heading directly for their vantage point. \"As it turned, the shape changed to only a half-sphere and we could see a red light glowing in the rear of the thing,\" Caveretta said. \"It came right out over the ocean toward Paradise Cove—sort of parallel to us—then it turned to face us and started coming down.\" Cavaretta seid he was scared and started running, but his companions held their ground, feo he halted, then walked back to join them. As the glowing sphere dropped down until it was about 1,000 feet off the ground, Cavaretta said, it turned toward them and stopped. At this point, as learned from Brian G. Williams, a MUFON investigator who interviewed Scott Aaland, Scott wanted to communicate with the object and made an inviting hand gesture, as tho to say, \"Come on down.\" The object then emitted two very bright flashes of light, of short duration. This was described as a piercing white light, as contrasted to the fellow- golden appearance of the object. Cavaretta also told of the light, in less detail, and continued: \"After that, it turned sideways again and just flashed across the bay at an in- credible speed. You just wouldn't believe how fast it moved.\" It appeared to follow the coastline and in less than ten seconds disappeared into the smog, haze and background lights of the Palos Verdes area.

F, 0. Lending Case in Missouri . . . Reported by Ted Phillips Mr. and Mrs. Brown (not their real name) live on a farm near a small town in south central Missouri. fj -'heir home is in a heavily wooded area off the main road and surrounded by oak and evergreen trees. Mr. Brown, 45, is a Navy veteran of Vforld War II with high school and two years of college education. There were some unusual happenings on their farm the night of Sept- ember 14, 1972, and all the evidence indicates that an unidentified - flying object landed on their farm and took off again. T e d Phillips, of the SKYLOOK staff, went to the scene to interview the Browns and to study the site where a bright light was seen and strange marks left in the soil. This report is written from a transcription of a tape recorded interview and Phillips 1 written account of his investigation. There is no electricity on the Brown farm. Mr. and Mrs. Brown had just turned on their battery powered television, a Panasonic Model, at 10 P.R. and started to watch a program when \"there started this sort of pulsation. I thought it was sperk plug interference. The light was dimmed and then brightened; it would be as though you were adjusting the contrast back and fi-rth—it would become bright and light—like that. The image would fade to a gray point. The pulses seemed to come and go in about two second intervals,\" Brown said. This pulsation lasted for one or two minutes, end then the picture started to roll and this lasted for a short time, perhaps a minute. After the disturbance ended, the Browns went outside where they saw s bright light in the south. J-t was 170 degrees south, 30 degrees above the horizon tnd stationary. Suddenly it moved upward about 5 degrees and stopped. °rown watched the object through 7 x 35 binoculars and is sure it wes not a conventional aircraft, such as a helicpoter. He stated that he would have heard sound and seen running lights on such a craft. What he did see was a round shape, slightly flattened at the base. When it was stationary, the color was blue-white; when in motion, a pulsation and various colors. The light was the size of a pea held at arms length. The light then moved to the right (west) about five degrees and stopped a^ain, briefly. ±t then moved back to the left (east) slowly and repeated this maneuver five or six times. The object then brightened and suddenly moved away to the west at a slight upward angle and was lost to view behind the trees. The total observation time was 15 to 20 seconds. The Browns went back to watch television which now operated normally. The Browns have three large dogs, kept for security and hunting, and at 3:00 A.M. they were awakened by all three dogs barking and howling. On going outside to seek the cause of the alarm, the Browns found the dogs at the southeast corner of the house, looking towards the woods and \"all bristled up and growling.\" Brown unsnapped the chain from the collar of one dog and urged him to go after the intruder, whatever it might be. \"This is a courageous dog, but he started whining and pawing the ground. h e didn T t want to go. 1 thought this f was strange,\" Brown said and thought there might be a big cat around. The two other dogs continued to howl and face tov^ard the woods. Brown had a flashlight and was directing its beam about the area without seeing anything unusual, when suddenly he and his wife were startled by a flash of light. It appeared to come from a point on, or near, the ground and illuminated the entire area for a split second. The dogs remained tense and excited, and Mrs. Brown was becoming a 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"little upset, so Brown decided to wait until daylight before doing any more investigating. The dogs didn ! t calm down until dawn, and the Browns were unable to sleep. When morning came, Brown went to the area where he had seen the flash of light. Walking slowly end looking all around, he proceeded ?bout 300 feet when he saw an evergreen which was discolored. \"I w£S looking around and saw these strenge little marks in the ground,\" he said, \"end a place thtt looked like it was scorched, only it w£sn T t scorched—it was like a scorch, but it looked oily. This also called my attention to the marks,\" he continued.\"No farm machinery of anything hed been in there. The road is an inside lane and is not open to outside traffic. <J -'here were no footprints in the area, just the marks.\" Ted Phillips went to the area Nov. 25, 1972. There had been several inches of rain and snow on the ground since the events of September. The evergreen, two feet from the edge of a depressed area, was still discolored on the side facing the oval. Another evergreen 25 feet from the site appeared normal. i he large, oval area with the grass still depressed so the outline was clearly defined, was measured and was 19-6 feet across from north to south and 14.4 feet across from east to west. •'•he oval is located in the northwest corner of a large field surrounded by trees. Brown had placed pieces of plastic and cans over the imprints to help preserve them, snd the three formed a triangle. The one in best condition had gone into the ground at least 40 mm and seemed to have carried most of the weight. \"One has the impression that if something did land there, it made a vertical ascent and descent, 11 Phillips concluded. \"Judging from the size and depth of the imprints, one would assume that the object was fairly light.\" He took soil samples, as well as a sample of the discolored portion of the tree, and made a plaster cest of the best imprint. Asked what he thought the object might have been, Brown replied, \"I couldn T t make a rash statement, all I know is my observation, I'll say this about it, it didn ! t fly like anything we have, tiiat 1 know. It was just totally different.\" Phillips stid the Browns were excellent witnesses. They did not attempt to color their story et any time, but simply related the events as they had seen them. n e has no doubt as to their reliability. Mr. and Mrs. Brown hsd reed a few UFO articles in recent years, and Brown recalls hearing of the \"foo fighters\" during the war; however, their knowledge of UFOs is limited and it is obvious they were not enough interested in the subject to \"expect\" to see a UFO or to relate any unusual event to one. In conclusion, Phillips says: \"Although no definite object was seen at the site, the animal reaction and observation of the flash (for which there is no obvious explanation) leading to the discovery of the site, prompts me to consider this a high quality report. 1 he ground markings were not m; de by animals. Whatever it was that penetrated the ground, it was a constructed device. One should also consider r,he fact that this type of lending site fits the pattern found in a number of other reports where a UFO has been seen at the site.\" Phillips 1 original report, which we have had to cut because of space limitations, includes seven examples of other lending cases which fit the same pattern of a lighted object being seen, a depressed area snd often burns, and the imprints forming a triangle. 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"UFOs Behind the Iron Curtain - Research by Joseph M.

It was last seen streaking west from Alliance toward Akron* Observers described what they saw, but don't know what it was. Members of the Mt. Calvary Church at Freed Street and Whitacre Avenue northwest of Minerva were the first to see and report the bright object which was seen during a 30-minute duration, but for just a few minutes by any one person. It was first seen by some of the church members driving home from a service, as they parsed through New Franklin. That was tbout 9:30. About 20 minutes later the object was seen near the church. It was also seen by another group which had left the service and were nearing Paris. Still another sighting was reported by members of the church as they reached their home at Homeworth. With one exception none of the groups knew the others also had sighted the unidentified something in the sky. They learned of their common sighting later when the church pastor, the Rev. Johannes Maes described what he and his family had observed tt the church. Only Allen Carroll and his daughter Vicki had seen the mysterious object near the church and then driven home to Homeworth to find it in plain view there, sometime about 10 p.m. The members of the church gave almost identical reports of what they saw. Pastor Maas and his wife said they were sitting in the living room of their home at the church when they saw red and white flashing lights approaching. They thought at first it was an airplane but then noticed it remained stationary. They estimated it to be 1,000 to 1,500 feet away, across a small valley from their home and either on, or just above, the ground. It was very dark and overcast following Wednesday night's downpour. They could see powerful lights like an airplane's landing lights—red and white, and flashing. From the positions of the lights they figured the craft which bore them must be circular or saucer-shaped and about 40 feet in diameter. Huling out an airplane because of the object's hovering, capacity, they then thought it might be a helicopter/ But subsequent observation of its fantastic speed and maneuvers riddled the helicopter theory. Besides, they could hear frogs in the valley clearly, and absolutely no sound—not even a hum—from the mystery craft. The Rev. Mr. Maas, who has just returned from a trip around the world and who is familiar with airplanes, compared the craft's speed with that of a jet and estimated the mystery ship was moving at a speed of 2,000 miles an hour. He said it apparently took a good look at Canton and the other cities, hovering here and there before darting off. He watched it disappear over the horizon once in the direction of southwest Canton (lie could see the lights of the city reflected on the low clouds). Then moments later, it disappeared. Mrs. Marjorie Ferguson, of Paris, deen of Rirls at Calvary Christian College there (the Rev. Mr. Maas is president), said as she watched the lighted object ehe felt it was not an airplane, and its subsequent move- ments strengthened this belief. Pastor Maas doesn't have any \"predrawn conclusions\" as to whet he saw. He thinks it could be scraetning extraterrestrial. Source: Canton (Ohio) \"Hepublic,\" March 16, 1973- Credit: Amerigo E.

Two See UFO Near Orland. California At 7:10 P.M. on April 14, 1972, Robert McGarr and his 5 year old son, Gery, were feeding stock on a ranch at the south edge of Orland, California. The child called his father 1 s attention to a bright, round light in the western sky. The object, a bright white in color, and round was as lerge as a dollar held at arm's length. The light, which was as bright as a headlight, did not shine a beam. ' A 'he object appeared to come from over the Black Butte Reservoir area, about four miles from the observers, and approached in a gradual descent in a zig zag course, and also with an up and down motion. At its closest position, it hovered briefly and a high pitched hum was heard. The object then retreated to the southward in the saraemotion, its approach and departure forming a V path. The total observation was about two and a half minutes. Elevation in the sky wts about 30 degrees. Mr. McGarr notified the sheriff T s office in Willows, California.

NASA Engineer Believes the Prophet Ezekiel Rode In A Spaceship A NASA engineer believes the land of Israel was visited some 2,600 years ago by a spaceship more sophisticated than anything modern tech- nology will be able to construct in the next 10 or 20 years. According to Josef F. Blumrich of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., the craft was an atomic-powered atmospheric-entry vehicle with four helicopter-like \"dinghies\" for local transportation on planets it visited. Blumrich, an Austrian by birth who has been in the United States since 1959, has written a book about the supposed visitation sometime around 592 B. C. Not yet available in English, it has just been pub- lished in Germany under the title \"Da Tat sich der Himmel auf.\" This roughly translates into English as \"the heavens were opened,\" which are words in the first verse, first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel that Blumrich believes set the state for the prophet T s account of man's earliest experience with space travel. Ezekiel's account of what he called his \"visions of God\" is one of 14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"the most graphic passages in the Bible. Psychologists have suggested that the prophet must have suffered a fit of some sort, but Blumrich looks at the report through an aeronautical engineer's eye. Viewed this way, he insists, Ezekiel's fiery chariot with wheels and winged beasts can be interpreted quite straightforwardly as a sort of cone-shaped central body about 70 feet high end about 75 feet across, with four landing legs that could be detached and flown independently in helicopter mode. Blumrich told a \"Chicago Sun Times\" reporter the design of Ezekiel's chariot fits right in with work he has been doing for NASA for the last several years. Only the power plant—which must have been nuclear to perform as Ezekiel said it did—is beyond present-day technology. Blumrich said he got turned on to kzekiel some yt.ars ago when he read a book by the gerraan author Erich von Daneniken,\"Gods from Outer Space\" which explores the possible role of space ships in early mystery visitations. \"Looking at it from a strictly engineering point of view, 1 thought it was all baloney,\" Blumrich recalled. \"I said to myself, ! Now I ! m going to get the Bible out and I'm going to contradict von Daeniken.\" But the more he read Ezekiel, the more convinced Blumrich became that this ancient prophet was describing in his own awestruck unsophis- ticated terms a very advanced type of spaceship. \"Right in the first chapter there is a detailed description of the thing he sees,\" Blumrich said. \"There are direct indications of landing legs, and it's clear that Ezekiel was very intimately familiar with structural detail. \"Once you know what the thing is sbout, it all fits together.\" It took Blumrich about a year and a half to work out his theory. Now, he says, \"the spacecrsft reconstructed from the Bible is, first of all, feasible, and secondly, of a technology that is not much beyond our pre- sent technological limitations.\" Summing it up, Blumrich said, \"All the design features indicate a very clever project design group—very high level engineering design.\" What impressed Blumrich most about Ezekiel's account is its internal consistency. \"If this was just a fantasy there would have been a contra- diction somewhere. But there is no contradiction. Ezekiel saw that space- craft and he flew in it.\" Credit: Thomas E. Miller.

This was written as one report, witnessed by Mr. and Mrs. Huffman end some friends—actually there were two sightings and no one is to blame for confusing them but Ye Ed—and we're sorry. It was a stupid mistake, and there is no excuse for it. On an August evening , around 7:30, in 1930, Mr. and Mrs. Huffman and four other observers saw two white objects coming toward them and the objects flew directly overhead. When overhead they appeared to be about as large and of the r.ame shape as the wings of a modern air-liner, but there was no body or tail. They flew side by side into the western sky, suddenly made a sharp 90 degree turn toward the south and disappeared from sight.

This makss its. minimum speed 1,5000 m.p.h. If 'it was .further than three miles away its speed would have been greater,\"' he \"said. He and his companion described the UFO. as luminous \"and cigar-shaped with a small \"ball of fire\" following it. The engineer, who said he did not believe in UFOs, said, \"If it was a meteor it was a huge one and its trajectory was different.\" It was travelling parallel to the western horizon.\" He did not want his name used.. Two other men in East Taieri, Mr. Major Miller and Mr. Ken Bailey, watched the UFO for about 20 seconds. Miller described it as huge, with a bright yellow nose with the yellow changing to bright red to- wards the tail. \"It made no noise and looked like an aircraft taking off but was goi ing far too fast to be one. It seemed to have a flaming tail follow- ing it and after about 20 seconds it just vanished,\" Miller said. The Feb. 21st edition of the \"Evening Standard\" quoted the director of Wellington's Carter Observatory, Kr. A. D. Gilmore,.as saying the object was \"almost certainly a fireball.\" However, a director of the Begg Observatory, in Dunedin, Mr. S, D. Watts, discounted what Mr. Carter said on the grounds that the long- est a fireball would last before it burnt itself out would be one to two seconds. He described a fireball as a slow-moving 'meteor which travelled at such a velocity that they existed in the earth's atmosphere only one or two seconds, before burnirg out. A building contractor in fiosgiel, Mr. Stan Smith, who reported seeing the UFO said he saw parts of it dropping- to earth. \"There were large pieces dropping of.f it which glowed, then disappeared.\" P.

Fleming, who had first thought the object was a conventional air- craft, dismissed that solution quickl} r because of its swift flight, sudden stop and hovering for a long period. There was no sound,. It was a clear, star lit night, with a bright moon in the west. The elevation of the object was estimated to be 35 to 40 degrees, and the distance from the observers, 2\\ miles. / Mr. Fulton, thank you for your very nice letter, and we T ll write just as soon as we can pin down another \"flying object\"--that spare moment.—Ye Ed7 Pennsylvania Man Frightened by Bright Lights A 25-year old Mohrsville, Pa., man who \"doesn't believe in UFOs\" was frightened out of his wits by \"somthing\" in the Berks County sky, March 29, 1973, according to the story published in the next day's \"Reading Eangle.\" Curtis Lash at approximately 5:30 PM stepped outside ; an office building under construction on Rattle snake Hill road, where he was laying carpet, to light a cigaret. \"I saw this bright light in the sky about 500 yards away and I assumed.it was a plane. But it just hovered in one place, so I thought it was a helicopter, but it wasn't making a sound/\" Lash sajd. \"1 don r t believe in UFOs, but I know I saw something tonight and whatever it was, it was awfully scary/' he added* In describing the mysterious objects, Lash said 'the bright, light would dim and a few seconds later, reappear. He could not discern the shape of the object, but saw red, green and white flashing lights* After about 10 minutes, a second object appeared in the sky and moved directly below the first one. It too began dimming its lights and then \"just disappeared.\" Lash was so unnerved by the event that it took him almost an hour before reporting his observations. Township police spoke to the man and concluded he had indeed witnesssd. a strange event, but a search- of the area turned up nothing unusual.  . ' Meanwhile police in Kutztown and Fleetwood came across three balloons near Virginville that had drifted into Berks County from Baltimore, Md. Cards attached to the balloons revealed that they had been launched by pupils at Pine Grove Elementary School, Baltimore, and asked that the cards be returned. A careful examination of the balloons failed to uncover any flashing red, green or white lights. Credit: Stan Gordon, MUFON State Director for Pennsylvania.
