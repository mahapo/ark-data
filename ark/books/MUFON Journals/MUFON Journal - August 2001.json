The research has been documented in a thesis for an MA degree in Religious Studies at Edith Cowan University here in Perth. Western Australia has an area that is al- most exactly one third that of the United States, yet its population is only about two million people, most of whom live in Perth, which is arguably the world's most geographi- cally isolated Western city. It was therefore of interest to see how alien abductions here compared with reports from USA and Eu- rope. The thesis is entitled \"Shamanism and Alien Abductions: A Comparative Study.\" Books such as John Mack's Passport to the Cos- mos (2000) and Kenneth Ring's The Omega Project (1992) have noted the similarities be- tween abduction narratives and shamanic ini- tiation experiences from around the world. Put simply, both types of experience in- volve people being taken unexpectedly by unearthly be- ings to a strange, otherworldly location where they may undergo a variety of often frightening indignities or chal- lenges. Upon their return they are often traumatised and bewildered, but may later manifest an increased in- terest in spiritual matters and the environment as well as claiming various paranormal abilities such as healing. The title of one of Thomas Bullard's several articles on the subject neatly summarises these similarities: \"UFO Abduction Reports: The Supernatural Kidnap Narrative Returns in Technological Guise\" (1989). My thesis makes no attempt to prove or disprove that UFOs or alien abductions actually exist. Similarly, an- thropologists studying shamanism generally make no at- tempt to determine whether a shamanic spirit world or paranormal abilities exist. For the study I interviewed eleven abductees from the only alien abduction support group in Perth. This was a qualitative rather than a quantitative study, so each interview took about one hour, during which ; time I asked each abductee the same twenty-six core questions which I had chosen to seek out any shamanic similarities. Some questions were simple (Have your feelings to- wards animals changed since your abduction(s)?), while others were more complex (Do you now believe in a hu- man soul or spirit? Why? Do you believe there is any form of life, or consciousness, after death? Do you now believe in a spirit realm or form of non-ordinary reality? Can you describe it?) Answers that seemed promising were followed up with further questions. I then compared the abductees' an- swers with the anthropological literature on shamanism from around the world. Documenting the results of this comparison takes up about half the fifty-six thousand word thesis, so I will quote only a part of the summary here: 1) Initiation and transformation The abductees' initial close encounter experiences often resemble shamanic initiation experiences because of their frightening, bizarre and paranormal nature, and the altered states of conscious- ness or dream states involved. These experiences can be repetitive and involve illness, symbolic animal imagery, and various spiritual entities. They invariably also result in the development of an animistic perspective in which the abductees regard the natural world as filled with unseen spiritual forces, leading them to express a deep concern for animals and environ- mental matters. Most importantly, their experiences ap- pear to introduce the abductees to a realm or aspect of reality to which most others in their society have little di- rect access or understanding. Such experiences and their new, extended vision pro- foundly transform the abductees into people who, though unusual, may-like shamans-be valued by others because of their anomalous gifts. 2) Genetic, ancestral and heredity concerns As in shamanism, the abductees encounter a variety of be- ings, some of whom they feel are related to them, may be"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 August 2001 MUFON UFO Journal their ancestors or even the creators and guardians of the human race. A dominant theme running through their abductions is the profound interest in genetics possessed by the entities they encounter. This has its counterpart in some shamanic creation myths, drawings and carvings of intertwined or twin-headed snakes [see anthropologist Jeremy Narby's book The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge (1998), London: Victor Gollancz]. There is also the interesting comparison be- tween many of the abductees' experiences and mythological and religious narratives of sexual contact between humans and various divine beings. The abductees and sometimes their families may undergo repeat abductions leading to a familiarity with one or more of these beings. Shamanic abilities are also of- ten inherited, and shamans may have ongoing relationships with some spirits. 3) Spirituality and otherworld encoun- ters The abductees regard most aliens as highly evolved spiritual beings, although they see others as more confronting, frightening or mischievous. Shamans, too, regard some spir- its as supportive and others as dangerous and must learn how to differentiate between them. Both aliens and shamanic spirits appear to have a similar capacity to transport people, sometimes in an out-of-body state, trance or dream state, into what seem to be other di- mensions, an otherworld, or after-death realm. This suggests that aliens and spirits may ac- cess or inhabit similar \"spiritual spaces\" or altered states of consciousness. 4) Healing and other paranormal abili- ties As a result of their early close encounter experi- ences, the abductees, like shamans, appear to develop a range of paranormal powers, especially diagnostic and healing abilities which they then use to help others. They may, however, need to learn to heal themselves first in order to gain a familiarity with such abilities. Both shamans and some abductees undergo terrifying dismemberment and skeletonization experiences which appear to teach them that their spirit or consciousness can transcend physical death. Shamans recruit various spirits to assist during their healing work, and likewise some of the abductees report that alien or spiritual beings may observe or assist while they are healing. These numerous similarities are not superficial or co- incidental and provide powerful confirmation for the an- ecdotal claims of such similarities between shamanic and abduction experiences made by some ufologists. It is also interesting that an isolated city such as Perth pro- duces similar results to those few studies on the abduc- tion-shamanism connection done in other parts of the world. Is this an example of American cultural influences spreading around the planet, or do alien abductions follow the same basic format everywhere? One could claim that these findings raise more questions than they answer. For example, why do these similarities exist? Can we now claim that aliens are actually spirits 'in technological guise'? Unfortunately, this is a relatively meaningless question because science has no idea what spirits are, and paranor- mal abilities are still controver- sial, although I recommend that all ufologists read Dr Dean Radin's book The Conscious Universe: The Scientific Truth of Psychic Phenomena (1997, New York: HarperEdge). Radin is director of the Con- sciousness Research Labora- tory at the University of Ne- vada and claims to have done classified research into psi for the US government. One possible explanation for these results is that, if genuine, aliens from elsewhere in this or a parallel universe are really ab- ducting people as reported. The similarity to shamanic initiations may be because some form of other-dimensional realm does exist and is being used by both shamans and aliens for their own purposes. Shamans, who first emerged in pre-technological times, appear to use altered states of consciousness to access or extract para- normal powers such as healing from this realm. Similarly, aliens may have done something that humans have yet to do* and that is to develop a \"technology of the paranormal\" which could perhaps be used in a variety of ways, such as long-distance travel (teleportation), as well as healing and/or consciousness manipulation of beings less advanced than themselves that they might wish to exploit or assist on their travels in various parts of the universe.  \"\" This abduction study suggests that ufologists-and per- haps scientists in general-might need to pay particular attention to the paranormal, consciousness-related aspects of the UFO phenomenon, because further research in this direction could prove important to an understanding of the abduction phenomenon, while failure to do so might prolong our apparent vulnerability to beings whose mas- tery of altered states of consciousness appears to be so much better than ours."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 2001 Page 5 WaltAndrus Woman claims entities saved her from death By Walter H. Andrus Jr. Former MUFON International Director This CE III case occurred during the first part of March, 1973, five miles west of Berry ville, AR, and ten miles east of Eureka Springs, AR, on U. S. highway 62.1 interviewed and tape recorded Mrs. Joan B. George on Sept. 1,1979, in her home in Hondo, TX, and later made drawings of the entities in the MUFON office in Seguin, TX, on Sep- tember 14,1979. Her husband Randall, was present for both interviews. The accident Before Randall George left on a business trip to Houston, TX, he had admonished Joan, his wife, to refrain from prun- ing the apple trees in their or- chard directly behind their home. (Four acres of property including their home, a guest house, a shop and a barn.) Orchards occupied areas both behind the home and to the west. The home was set back from U. S. Highway 62 with a curved drive leading to the home and shop. Even though it was late in the season to prune apple and peach trees, Joan disregarded her husband's recom- mendations and proceeded to do so. She obtained from the shop a home-made ladder about ten feet in height constructed of 2x4 lumber for both legs and steps made of Ix4's. (I found the ladder in the shop during a follow-up visit while attending an annual UFO Conference in Eu- reka Springs, AR) The ladder weighed about 65 pounds. Since it was a home-made ladder with only two legs, Joan propped it up into the limbs of the apple tree-with difficulty due to its weight. Joan is five feet five inches tall and barely weighs 100 pounds (very slender). After she had climbed part way up the ladder to start pruning, it became disengaged in the supporting limbs and fell to the ground, trapping Joan under it. Knocked unconscious The fall apparently knocked Joan unconscious. When she regained consciousness she found herself on the ground lying under the heavy ladder, and saw that the right thigh area of her olive-colored jumpsuit was satu- rated with blood. Since Joan was a graduate of the nurs- ing school at Duke University and a registered nurse, she assumed that the fall had broken her right leg, causing a compound fracture, and that the blood was from the bone protruding through the flesh.. She was unable to lift the heavy ladder off of her body, and felt that without help she might bleed to death there in the orchard. When she regained consciousness she noted that the sun had set and it was twilight, but still with good visibility. The municipal golf course surrounded their small farm on the east and south sides. She yelled at the \"top of her lungs\" for assistance, but no one responded to her plea from the golf course or from neighbors some dis- tance away. She felt very helpless and believed she was doomed to die. Help Arrives After having given up being rescued, her prayers were answered when two individuals she first mistook for \"hip- pies\" came floating through the orchard toward her. When they got closer, she noted by their facial appearance, body build and clothing that they did not resemble any hippies that she had ever confronted before. The first one to approach her was four feet tall or less^, with a frail body, large head with black piercing eyes, no noticeable neck, a heavy protruding brow over the eyes, a very small nose with nostrils, and a horizontal line or scar for a mouth. No ears were visible. The complexion of the face was a grey-brown. The slim body had long arms compared to a human, with an elbow, but a long forearm. The legs were short with no defined knee that would bend when the entity moved. It floated instead of walked, skimming over the ground without disturbing the grass in the orchard. No traces were left by either entity in the orchard by their presence. Both entities had four unusually long fingers on each hand. No thumb was observed. When the first entity touched Mrs. George, the hand felt like rough sandpaper, and was intensely cold, like a dead person. The clothing of the taller entity was a tight-fitting one-piece suit, blue/ grey in color, and looked like double knit material. Both arms had a tight elastic band at each wrist. The feet were very small compared to a human, and were covered with tan/grey soft suede boots. The head was covered by a tight fitting blue/green skull cap. Unusual voices When Joan conversed with the leader or taller entity, she heard the voice in her head, not through her ears. The first entity's voice was high-pitched, but very pleasant sounding, with a mechanical sound. (A little bit like a ra- dio tuned to the sideband of an AM broadcast station-a slight lisp.) It was a beautiful sounding voice. Entity number two was approximately three feet nine inches tall, and its voice sounded like the voice of an eight- year-old boy. It also had black piercing eyes with the same facial features, but the face was wrinkled like a prune. The clothing was entirely different from entity number"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 August 2001 MUFON UFO Journal one. The suit looked like rolls of plastic with lighted self-illumination at the mid-section of the body. It might be compared to numerous bicycle inner tubes of differ- ent sizes and diameters. Whenever the entity would bend over, the tube shape would flatten out across its back. The tube sections would separate at the elbows or when bent over to help Mrs. George. The clothing was similar to the \"Michelin Tire Man\" in their advertisements, ex- cept the tubes were smaller in diameter. The short legs did not seem to have knees. Its long arms were proportional to the first entity. The rescue In desperation, Joan asked the entities to help her remove the heavy ladder from her body. Considering her injury and the two frail entities, it was questionable whether this could be accomplished. Fortunately, by com- bining their efforts, they were able to lift the ladder from Joan's body, thus freeing her. When the ladder was removed, the taller entity told her to get up. She pointed to the blood soaked leg of her jumpsuit and said she couldn't, but she found that she could indeed get up to her feet when she tried, without assistance; I assumed that as a registered nurse, she should have called her family doctor for medical help or checked into the local hospital, since her husband, Randall, was in Houston, TX on a business trip, but she stated that the wound essentially healed in four days with only her personal care. As a UFO investigator, I asked for verification of the wound. Joan showed my wife and me a four-inch scar on her right thigh just above the knee. (She could not have supported herself after the accident if a compound dis- placed fracture to the thigh bone had occurred.) Joan was so indebted to these two entities who had lit- erally saved her life that she invited them into her home for a meal. They appeared frail and skinny, so she felt that they needed a good \"home cooked meal\" to put a little more flesh upon their bodies. They declined her gracious invitation by saying telepathically that they could only par- take of \"juice,\" not food. She thought to herself that she had both orange and tomato juice in her refrigerator and she had canned apples, peaches and grapes in her storage storm cellar.. t Wrong kind of juice Before she had the opportunity to answer them verbally, the taller one or leader responded telepathically by saying ENTITY #1 BERRWILLE, AR ;OAN GEORGE IS 5V. THIS ENTITY WAS 4 FEET TALL OR LESS DRAWN BY: Walter H Andrus, Jr. ENTITY #2 MARCH 1973 BERRYVTLLE, AR ENTITY « WAS APPROXIMATELY 39' TALL DRAWN BY Water H. Andrus, Jr. ''A/* *,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 2001 Page 7 The medallion \"not that kind of juice,\" reading her mind. She was very disappointed that they could not accept her hospitality, since she is a very compassionate and kind person. When Joan was unable to express her gratitude to the two entities for saving her life, she asked them when she might see them again. They said it was questionable since they \"do not travel these trade routes very often.\" Joan says that before leaving, the leader gave her a momento to keep to commemorate their visit. It is a small round medallion approximately two inches in diameter with a ring or handle like a pocket watch. The outside ring is a series of small round holes, while the center is composed of something looking like a beetle and vee-shaped sup- ports between the inside circles. It is metal and appears to be oxidized like the metal iron, since rust in prevalent. (George Wood, a MUFON member in San Antonio, TX, has been trying to interpret the symbols on the medallion to determine if they have any meaning.) Possible tie to the Marjorie Fish Star Map In the Astronomy magazine reprint of the article titled \"The Zeta Reticuli Incident\" by Terrence Dickinson (still available from MUFON for $3), the work of Marjorie Fish in constructing a three-dimensional star map is re- lated. Miss Fish was endeavoring to test the validity of the star map that Betty Hill had observed within the craft and had drawn in 1964 under posthypnotic suggestion. When data from the Catalog of Nearby Stars, 1969 edition, by Wilhelm Gliese was released, Marjorie was able to successfully construct a map using the most likely stars that could have planets revolving about them that duplicated the star map drawn by Betty Hill. (For more details please refer to the reprint of the referenced ar- ticle.) The lines on the map, according to Betty Hill, were described by the alien as \"trade routes\" or \"places visited occasionally\" with the dotted lines as \"expeditions.\" Any interpretation of the Betty Hill map must retain the logic of these routes (i.e. the lines would link stars that would be worth visiting). Please note that when Mrs. George asked the entities when she might see them again, their answer was that it was questionable, since they \"do not travel these trade routes very often.\" Does this response relate to the Betty Hill star map and their communications to Betty, or is there any significance? After completing my tape recorded interview, I gave Mrs. George a copy of the referenced article from As- tronomy magazine. She expressed her displeasure when I refused to tell her anything about entities. Obviously, as a UFO field investigator, one cannot take a chance in contaminating the witness in any way. She was not fa- miliar with the famous Betty and Barney Hill Case as depicted in John Fuller's book Interrupted Journey. Analysis of the medallion In 1973, after the conclusion of the largest UFO flap in U.S. history, serious attempts were initiated to get the assistance of NASA in conducting a comprehensive study of the UFO phenomenon, something the Condon Com- mittee at the University of Colorado failed to accomplish in 1968-1969. President Jimmy Carter looked favorably upon this suggestion, but NASA declined officially unless funds were appropriated. NASA did volunteer to study any material received from a crashed UFO site or material from a claimed UFO. After enticing Joan to break a sample from her medallion, John F. Schuessler's connections with NASA at the Space Center in Houston provided a means of officially submitting a sample of possible extraterrestrial material to NASA for metal analysis. Even though NASA would not produce a written analy- sis of the oxidized metal submitted, they told John it was lead like that used to make the letters for a printing press. However, they did return the sample which could be ana- lyzed in another laboratory. It is obviously not lead, since the oxidation or rust on the surface is similar to iron, not lead. We can only conjecture why NASA did not provide MUFON with a written analysis. Although I interviewed Mrs. George in 1979, this re- port was not published pending significant information that was being released to Leonard Stringfield by a retired U.S. Air Force doctor in Ohio on an autopsy of an entity cadaver. The results of the doctor's analysis and draw- ing can be compared to the two entities with their de- scription and my drawings. Both have been a major part of MUFON's traveling UFO exhibit, as well as at the MUFON museum, which is now in Colorado."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Page 8 August 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Arizona object puts on show for witnesses . The primary witness, Leonard Chavez, states that he was traveling south of Casa Grande, AZ, on the Chu Chiu Readjust past the overpass on 1-8, on May 29,2001, at approximately 8:20 p.m. As he prepared to turn east on Hannah Road, he says he became aware that it had suddenly become darker than it had been moments be- fore. There was a half moon and he described the visibil- ity as \"fair.\" As he prepared to turn, two lights which he said were about six to ten feet in diameter turned on about 50 feet in the air above him and to his right. These lights went out, but were followed by two more alongside the first two. These shut off and were followed by four turning on be- side the last two. These four, which appeared to have been located on the northeast side of the object, then shut off, according to the witness. Eight lights on the southeast side of the object came on simultaneously, then they also shut off. So the pattern was two, two, four, then eight lights. Chavez said these were not beams or spotlights, but were muted lights, such as would come through an opaque glass. The lights were bright enough, however, to allow the wit- ness to see in good detail the panels these lights were set in. Chavez said the object was large, and appeared to be dull black in color, with no markings present. It hovered in place and made no sound. He stated he had not been aware of it until the lights appeared, except for the sensa- tion that something was blocking the normal light from the sky. Chavez quickly drove a mile to his home and picked up his nephews, ages 23 and 20, so they could also witness the object. However, when he returned to the location the object had left. But a few minutes later they spotted what appeared to be the same light pattern a mile or so to the south. They proceeded south on Chu Chiu Road in pursuit, getting near enough to the object to see the de- tails around the lights as it repeated its pattern. The ob- ject then headed toward a mountain range to the south and disappeared. Chavez was described by his brother-in-law, Terry Day, as a skeptic prior to the encounter, and Day assured in- vestigator Ken Kerber that none of the witnesses had been drinking or using drugs. Kerber reports that the witnesses are \"of sound minds, and honest in their recol- lections without exaggeration.\" Study suggests that more planets may exist than previously expected The Hiirvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics has announced that a study of brown dwarf stars suggests more planets may exist than predicted. Astronomers analyzing brown dwarf stars in the Orion nebula with an infrared telescope have determined that many of the failed stars are ringed by protoplanetary disks of dust and gas just like true stars. The finding suggests a high percentage of stars have planets or solar systems similar to our own. Although only fifty or so planets have been identified outside our solar system, millions or even billions of planets may exist.

Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region UK documents show near misses with UFOs The Western Daily Press, Bristol, England, reported the following on June 15: Hundreds of passengers were within a split second of Britain's worst aviation disaster when two jets missed colliding by just 100 feet at Heathrow airport. The public was shocked, and public confidence severely dented. However, what air travelers didn't know was that in the last two decades there have been around 30 similar near misses-with UFOs. The Western Daily Press has uncovered a dossier detailing the r . F ., sensational incidents. The Civil George v Her Aviation Authority's \"X-Files\" are now in the possession of top investigative author Nick Redfern, who has shown the contents to the Daily Press. The CAA's hidden files, only recently released after years under wraps, documents pilots' and air traffic controllers' descriptions of the uni- dentified flying objects, which were close to bringing down jets loaded with passengers. Last night the CAA's spokesman Chris Mason said of the classified papers: \"Our reports are from highly trained pilots and air traffic controllers. We have no argument with what they say they have seen, even if what they saw can't be explained. \"We admit that in some cases the aircraft which were nearly in collision with the aircraft have never been traced. We keep an open mind about UFOs. Some things just can't be explained, but they have been reported by top professionals, and we do take that into account.\" The CAA has been carefully and quietly collecting and analyzing data pertaining to near-collisions between air- liners and UFOs for a number of years. In addition, while such a claim might sound like something straight out of an episode of The X-Files, it is one supported by the CAA's' own records. \"I've never seen anything like it before and can't ex- plain what it was,\" said British Airways pilot Mike Dalton of his sighting of a large, silver, disc-shaped object from his Boeing 737 on a flight from Rome to Gatwick on the night of Nov. 5, 1990. \"My copilot and I called in two cabin crew to see it, and then it went out of sight. Ground radar couldn't pick it up, so it must have been traveling at phenomenal speed.\" Subsequent investigations determined the UFO had been seen by a second B A pilot and the pilot of an RAF Tornado aircraft who was obliged to take \"violent eva- sive action\" to avoid a collision with it. On the night of 21 April, 1991, the term' 'close encoun- ter\" took on an altogether more significant meaning for the crew and passengers of a London-bound airliner. At 9:00 pm Captain Achille Zaghetti, who was piloting a McDonnell MD-80 aircraft, was amazed to see an uni- dentified flying object pass his aircraft as it flew over the coast of Kent at a height of more than 22,000 feet. As the UFO was no more than 1,000 feet above the airliner, and the incident therefore classed as a \"near- miss,\" an official inquiry was launched by the CAA. Ap- proximately two weeks later the following brief statement was issued: \"The pilot said the object was light brown, round, three meters long, and did not describe any means ofpropulsion.\" The aircraft was under the control of London air traf- fic control center, which had no other aircraft in the vicin- ity, but consistent with the pilot report, a faint radar trace was observed ten nautical miles behind the Alitalia air- craft. \"Extensive inquiries have failed to provide any indi- cation of what the sighting may have been.\" But more was to come. The next incident to occur took place on June 1,1991, when a yellow-orange cylin- drical object, ten feet long, was seen at close quarters by the crew of a Britannia Airways Boeing 737 en route to London from Dublin. Sixteen days later, yet another cylindrical-shaped UFO was sighted, this time by one Walter Leiss, a German engineer aboard Dan Air flight DA 4700 as it headed toward Hamburg. On Jan. 6,1995, Captain Roger Wills and copilot Mark Stuart were beginning their descent towards Manchester Airport in a Boeing 737 twin jet with 60 passengers on board. Seventeen minutes before touchdown, a mysteri- ous, triangular-shaped UFO flashed past the right-hand side of the aircraft at a distance described as being \"very close\"-so close, in fact, that the crew instinctively \"ducked\" in their seats. This is an extract from the conversation between crew of the B737 and the radar controller. B737: \"We just had something go down the RHS just above us very fast.\" MANCHESTER: \"Well, there's nothing seen on the ra- dar. Was it an aircraft?\" B737: \"Well, it had lights; it went down the starboard side very quick [and] just slightly above us, yeah.\" MANCHESTER: \"Keep an eye out for something, I can't see anything at all at the moment, so must have been very fast or gone down very quickly af- ter it passed you I think.\" B737: \"Okay.

It was probably less than 1000 feet high up.\"We just watched for about eight minutes,\" states the witness, \"when it started to rise.

A couple and their two children (girl 5, boy 1) and two friends were bound for Martha's Vineyard on an eight-seat pri- vate jet on June 2,2001. The witness states, \"We took off from Teterboro Air- port in New Jersey at 6:45 PM in thick cloud cover. When the aircraft came up out of the clouds after take-off we broke out into bright sunlight. My friend, who was seated in front of me by the right wing of the aircraft, called out 'what the *$#@ is that?' Immediately I looked out of my window at 7:00 PM. Behind us on the right side of the plane and some distance above, perhaps 1000 to 3000 feet, was this large rusty red boomerang-shaped object silhouetted against the bright blue sky. \"We were now above storm and had a good view. The craft had no windows or lights visible, and was about the size of a large 747 jet aircraft. It hovered in place for several seconds before we lost sight of it. My friend, who had first sighted it for a greater duration, said it looked as if it had bulbous shapes, which joined to form the boomer- ang or flying chevron. We both agreed, however on the size and color of the object. My 5-year-old daughter also caught a glimpse of the object. \"Due to the storm below us we thought it could have been some weather-monitoring balloon. By this time in the flight we were probably quite near J.F.K and LaGuardia airport. The total flight was 35 minutes. The UFO re- sembled nothing I have ever seen. Especially the red cherry color struck us as odd. We meant to ask the pilot, but in all the excitement we forgot. Thanks to NUFORC \"Flying submarine\" reported in Texas ALVIN — Three teenage witnesses were outside when they heard a loud whistle and humming sound on June 6, 2001, according to the stepfather of one of the witnesses. They looked up and saw a craft that resembled a \"flying submarine\" with three lights on it (red in front, then green, then blue all in a line on the right side). It appeared right over their heads at 8:42 PM just above the tree line by the house. The UFO followed the driveway down to the next tree line, whereupon it suddenly shot off upwards and to the right, quickly disappearing towards the almost full moon in the northeast sky. The object was charcoal gray color in the dark night sky. The three lights on the object were bunking rapidly like a strobe. All of the witnesses were reportedly frightened by the experience. They include a recent high school graduate (18) and two females (17 and 15). They immediately no- tified the stepfather of one of the witnesses. There is a slight possibility of about 20 minutes of missing time, but not all of them can agree on this. Hovering object in California WOODLAND HILLS - Tom writes, \"On June 29, 2001, at approximately 8:30 PM. my friend and I were just leaving my house to go to work when he pointed to a distant object in the sky. It was close to dusk and the object was backlit by the sunset and looked to be due north of us on the opposite side of the San Fernando Val- ley. The craft was hovering over the Santa Susana Pass about three miles away and about 2000 feet altitude. This is a test site for Rockwell International, now a subsidiary ofBoeing. \"We saw a dark, diamond-shaped silhouette about the size of a mini-van. The weather was clear, and this was not an atmospheric anomaly. What immediately struck me about the object was its apparent solidity and unnatu- ral motionlessness. Both my friend and I have worked around aircraft. It produced no exhaust plume nor any other atmospheric disturbance, and we could not hear any noise produced by any means of propulsion. We observed the object for a total of about 15 minutes, during which time it did not move. However, after five minutes we no- ticed a slight bobbing, which was a few feet of vertical movement. It was sudden and unnatural, as if the object were about to fall, but was able to catch itself and regain altitude. \"My girlfriend and her friend also saw the object. Nei- ther of them knew what to make of it either, so we drove towards the pass. When we got about a mile away we saw three helicopters approach and circle the object at a distance of a few hundred feet. The helicopters were flying with navigation lights and appeared larger than the object, but night was falling fast, and the object did not have any lights. We lost sight of the object behind some trees, and after the area came back up in our line of sight, the helicopters were circling alone. \"I parked the car over a a mile away from the Santa"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 2001 Page 11 Susana Pass, and we watched the helicopters leave.

The teenager was watch- ing something out the back window that he said was not a plane. He takes flight lessons and likes to watch the skies. Both witnesses say they saw an orange-colored round object above them that was moving slowly southwest. It had some type of an extension that seemed to circle the whole object continuously as it moved. Then it stopped, and as it started again it headed more in a western direction. Then a bright orange object shot off of it very fast and went south and was gone. As the object moved, another bright but very small object shot off and went in the same direction as the main object. This happened several more times, and they all disap- peared. \"My son and I were just awestruck.\" says the mother. A second witness also reported seeing the same object ten minutes earlier: \"On my way home going west on 112 something caught my eye to the south. It had a red light that moved right to left. I only saw the light on one side, but I got a glimpse of the rest the object and it was MUFON Mutual UFO Network, me Website: ://www.mufon.com These oval 3\"X4\" MUFON logos (shown slightly smaller) are great for sticking on car windows, lug- gage, notebooks, etc. Available from MUFON for $1 each, or 3 for $2 postpaid. like an olive.

Alison (29) of Lant Lane watched a UFO for around 30 seconds at 10:35 PM. She described it as disk-shaped and having four green flashing lights, arranged in a square. \"It was huge and must have been 1,000 feet high,\" she reported. \"It was nothing like an airplane or star. Someone else must have seen it.\" The craft reportedly made no movement. Alison stepped outside to call her boyfriend from their garage so he could share in the strange close encounter. Her sighting is now the 27th in the Derbyshire Dales since last September. The region is becoming widely known as a UFO hotspot among enthusiasts, and features extensively on websites all over the world. New York Fox News video On July 2,2001, and several succeeding days Fox News at various locations around the US has been showing a video of a helicopter flying over Manhattan with a pas- senger shooting a video of a UFO. The Sci-fi Channel sought submissions from viewers in their search for UFO videos last year. They received an excellent video of the UFO, although the pilot does not appear to see the object. The UFO comes from behind a building and makes a high speed run at the helicopter and climbs up into the atmosphere. MUFON's video expert, Jeff Sainio, ana- lyzed the film and feels it is unlikely a hoax. Rumania object disrupts power? BUCHAREST — A June 28, 2001, message to Jim Hickman reports that a few minutes after 4:00 AM, the night shift personnel of a business were alarmed by the sudden interruption of their electric lighting. On going to see whether there might be some defect with the current, they observed a powerful light over the city. They climbed a nearby hill and were able to see an oval object of about 11 meters in diameter, which was emitting a cold white light like a sodium lamp.

I knew that beyond that hill was a small side road where there should not be lights. \"I saw a white glow, reminiscent of a streetlight.

The triangle formation we saw was out of our atmosphere. I could tell by size and distance etc. The triangle was up in space in the Milky Way, but it flew backwards. \"It was an inverted triangle flying in a manner in which I had never seen before at a speed much greater than a human made craft.

Thanks to Ken Imeskenimes@hotmail.com Disclosure project BOULDER, COLORADO — The Disclosure cam- paign got off to a great start on June 23,2001, at the large auditorium at the University of Colorado. A capacity crowd was on hand to listen to Dr. Stephen Greer and watch the video testimony of twenty government witnesses concern- ing UFO and extraterrestrial events. We in the Disclosure Project are asking that everyone help by writing or faxing letters to your senators and rep- resentatives asking for congressional hearings. Not ev- eryone agrees with Greer's approach that assumes the Aliens are friendly. Maureen Murphy of the Allies of Hu- manity said, \"We don't disagree with Dr. Greer on the disclosure agenda, because the aliens are taking women against their will, they're taking the eggs, they're creating a race that will have an allegiance to the visitors.\" Note: My point of view is that very little real research is being done to determine what the Aliens are planning. They may be friendly and they may have ulterior mo- tives. First we have to acknowledge they are here and then we have to determine their motives. Dr. David Jacobs of Temple University in his book The Threat indicates the abduction phenomenon is far more ominous than he had thought. Former FAA employee says sighting real FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION — In the US the FAA controls the skies in peacetime. It seems reasonable to learn the truth about UFOs from represen- tatives of the FAA such as John Callahan, the former head of Accidents and Investigations. He is one of the key witnesses of the Disclosure Project with stacks of government documents, computer print- outs, and video proving the existence of a UFO over Alaska in 1986. Several civilian and military radar's tracked the object while multiple pilots saw the giant craft; It would be very difficult for anyone to dispute his testimony, which is backed by numerous witnesses.  \" ; He testified that he provided this information to key government personnel at a briefing at the Reagan White House. The CIA issued instructions that the meeting never happened and no information should be released to the public. John admits the FAA generally will not release information about UFOs to anyone, including the pilots. Callahan provided more real evidence in five minutes of testimony than I have heard in years of UFO confer- ences. I encourage all in the field of Ufology to help un- cover witnesses of similar stature. There are points of disagreement between Dr. Greer and myself, but he has reached the witnesses that can make a difference. It is time to publicize the testimony of witnesses of the caliber of John Callahan and the other speakers at the Disclosure Project. Ohio Disc in 1933 GffiSONBURG — John Schuessler reports he re- ceived the following report from a 78-year-old. The wit- 'ness states, \"In 1933,1 was ten years old and returning from school one block from my home at 424 W. Stevenson St. I heard a whining sound and looked up and saw two discs connected by a thin shaft moving slowly through the air. Icould riot guess the height or size of the discs. At the time I was deeply in the hobby of building model airplanes-the balsam and tissue paper variety with rub- ber band motors. I ran home and told my mother I had seen a different model airplane. She dismissed my story as imagination. I have searched through libraries to see if I could see a picture in books like the discs I had seen to no avail. I am now almost 78 years old and have never forgotten this. I am a retired FBI agent and was not dreaming when I saw what I saw.

Two laboratory scien- tists connected to reproduction-related clinics had become intrigued by an apparent increase in the incidence of ste- rility among male patients. . The two searched the labs' records and discovered that, over the course of three decades, sperm counts among the thousands of men attending those clinics had decreased 43 percent on average.  v In that a single ejaculation produces millions of sperm, even if that reduction were projected across the entire populace, there were still plenty of sperm for the. typical healthy man to procreate. But the yellow warning flag was up, so they expanded their research. They soon came upon the apparent culprit: pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers employed in western civilization's agriculture. Some of these introduce a faux estrogen into our food chain. In adult females, the mimicking estrogen apparently has little deleterious effect. But in males, the chemical attacks and destroys testosterone, they said, and thereby the ability to.produce sperm. The two scientists went on to investigate how exten- sive the introduction of this faux estrogen had become. To their surprise, if not horror, even plastic milk jugs as well as metal cans for fruits and vegetables .contained traces of the contaminant. .Their conclusions: (1) The faux estrogen has unfortu- nately pervaded our entire food chain; (2) by the year 2050, in societies that continue to use these chemicals on farm fields at this rate, the average man will be sterile; and (3) the public will undoubtedly hear more of these stories in coming years. Younger Female Puberty American science magazines, in addition to occasional newspaper articles, in recent years have noted a seeming increase in the proportion of girls reaching puberty at ex- traordinarily early ages. Nine, eight or even seven years of age at the onset have been recorded with mystifying frequency. If there has been a concomitant lowering of the age of puberty in American boys', mentions in the media have'escaped my attention. Rather, this seems to be a girls-only phenomenon. Estrogen is the trigger for puberty in human females. Might it be that the ingestion of common foods containing a faux estrogen is responsible? A gator warning The May 2001 issue of Discover magazine sounded a warning cry concerning our nation's alligator population.' •After years of collecting and testing thousands of eggs and nestlings, researcher Walt Rhodes of-the South Caro- lina Department of Natural Resources has determined that, in certain gator communities, a pronounced contrac- tion in the size of the males' sex organs is inhibiting the ability to procreate. The cause? According to Rhodes, it is the runoff into their habitats of water from adjacent farm fields contain- ing chemicals laden with an \"environmental estrbgen\"- again the product of commercial pesticides, herbicide's and fertilizers. He speculated that gator populations in those regions will inevitably shrink. ' : ; . Granted, alligators do not exactly rank with koalas and giant pandas as creatures evoking our sympathy. But they do have the distinction of predating even dinosaurs in Earth's history. They have survived continent^consumirig glaciers and other dramatic climatic changes. It should be worrisome to all of us that this remarkably adaptive spe- cies might be felled now by its penchant for a watery home and our insistence on maximizing crop yields nearby. . , , ' ,An Alien Connection What does any of this have to do with alien visits to our planet? For those familiar with the history of the UFO subject, it comes to mind that the 1960s and 1970s in par- ticular were rife with episodes ,of saucers and other craft types landing in farm fields. Diminutive entities would emerge from the ship momentarily,to gather samples of a crop or the soil, then quickly retreat before the craft sped into the night. These personal sightings, were in turn far outweighed by the numbers of presumed landing sites discovered by farmers in their fields during that period. Perhaps the aliens only wanted to learn how to repli- cate soybeans or com or wheat. But I doubt it. Curiously, the 1990s had comparatively few such encounters, as if to suggest that our visitors knew the die had already been cast.    - . From 1992 through 1997,1 conducted a MUFON re- search project on abductions, studying the audiotapes of regressive hypnosis sessions involving some 265 sepa- rate cases throughout the U.S. Revealed in one of those tapes was a claimed telepathic communication from a being to the human subject, merely five words, that have remained with me: \"Your food is not good.\" There was no furtherance of that thought, and its full implications were lost on me at the time. Now it seems terribly pro- phetic. Conclusion Many years ago Walt Andrus and I were discussing the possible reasons for aliens' emphasis on reproductive concerns in the course of human abductions.

That was the conventional wisdom of the time, and certainly appeared sound. But, with all due and well-de- served respect for Walt, what if it's the other way around? I am hot a physical scientist. An official of the USD A or a university's cooperative extension service might well respond with a litany of reasons why pesticides, herbi- cides and fertilizers are our friends, the wonders of mod- ern agriculture that have magnified crop yields many fold. And with a world population projected to increase by billions in the coming century, in the absence of a viable alternative who can argue against the obvious need to feed the hungry? So, I raise these points for the primary purpose of generating discussion among MUFON's con- sultants and others with solid backgrounds in the sciences. Neither am I in practice an enthusiast of organic farm- ing or \"health foods.\" Having lived two-thirds of a life and consumed my share of processed foods, I figure my body is either utterly resistant to all those multi-syllabic additives or I'm already doomed.

But maybe some- one who can help will call. Grayson County Sheriff Joe Brad Hudson is puzzled over recent livestock killings and mutilations in southern Grayson County. The latest occurred about seven weeks ago near Nolin Lake and is still under investigation. A 2-month old Appa- loosa colt belonging to Mike and Rose Downs was found dead in a pasture. The sheriff found a 1 -inch hole in the animal's chest, but he found no bullet exit wound or shell casing, and no blood around the carcass. The colt's sexual organs were missing. About a year ago, Leonard Bruner, the Downs' neigh- bor, found one of his heifer calves dead in the edge of woods on his farm-her sexual organs, tongue, and one ear removed, and no blood on the animal or on the ground. These are not the only unsolved cases of animal muti- lations in the area. Moran Mudd, who lives in Sadler, about 10 miles south of Leitchfield, lost a Hereford bull some years ago. When he found the animal in a small stream bed on his farm, the bull's sexual organs were missing. His hooves had also been removed so cleanly that they looked as though they could have fallen off. But they were lined up-the two front hooves in front of the two back hooves-on a nearby flat rock. Several long hairs from the bull's tail were hanging from a nearby tree limb about 4 feet off the ground. There was no sign of a bullet wound and there was no blood. \"Buzzards wouldn't even eat him,\" Mr. Mudd said. \"It's weird.\" Such mutilations have been occurring at irregular in- tervals around Grayson County for at least 25 years, with- out explanation. No arrests are known to have ever been made. Sheriff Hudson says his office has considered the pos- sibility of cult activity, but officials have neither seen nor heard other evidence suggesting the presence of a cult. \"It's like a no-motive murder,\" he said. \"Once you get so far, you're pretty much at a standstill.\" -Thanks to Kenny Young for this report Editor's Note This issue of the MUFON UFO Journal went to press just prior to the Symposium in July, so the Symposium events could not be included.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Preston Dennett, a Field Investigator for MUFON, is the author of three other books, including UFOs Over Topanga Canyon (1999). This latest effort involves the accounts of ten in- dividuals, including a medical doctor, an airline me- chanic, a house- wife, a military man, a therapist, a waitress, an actor, a factory worker, a store manager, and an office worker, who have reported UFO encounters. Dennett allows the witnesses to tell their own stories, but provides commentary to put the accounts into per- spective for those new to the field. He also includes a helpful index. Although Preston is from California, the encounters occurred not only in California, but also in Ari- zona, Idaho, Michigan, New Mexico, New Jersey, and Washington. Nine of the cases involve missing time, and nine fea- ture the presence of alien beings. Seven reportedly in- volve communication between the alleged extraterrestri- als and abductees, although in two of the cases the only communication was from the entities, telling the abductees not to be afraid. Five of the cases involve physiological reactions, in- cluding unexplained nosebleeds, a missing fetus, and an interrupted menstrural cycle. Five involved unexplained cuts or bruises, one an apparent healing, one possible im- plants, one a heat beam, one a beam that apparently caused static electricity and a coppery taste in the mouth, one extreme thirst and an extreme need to urinate, and two cases in which the witness was placed in a trance state. There are also physical traces, animals, and electro- magnetic effects within the accounts. Six of the ten cases occurred while the witnesses were driving at night on a remote road, while four took place in dense suburban ar- eas. In seven of the ten cases the witnesses recalled the encounter without the aid of hypnosis. In terms of psychological reactions, four of the wit- nesses declined to talk about the event in the days and weeks after it happened. Ah 1 ten witnesses reported more than one encounter, and none of them reported the en- counters as entirely negative, although in three of the cases the witnesses were frightened by their experiences. None felt the aliens are evil, and four of the witnesses reported that their encounters were positive experiences. While this book seems to be directed more toward those new : to the field, veteran ufologists should find the ac- counts interesting as well. Swamp Gas Times-My Two Decades on the UFO Beat by Patrick Huyghe, Paraview Press, 1674 Broadway, Suite 4B, New York, NY 10019 (www.paraviewpress.com), 5X8 softcover, 349 pages, $17.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This book consists of 54 stories or articles written by Huyghe for a variety of publications over the past couple of decades, each emphasizing a particular aspect of the UFO phenomenon. The first article, written in 1977, recounts the 1952 re- ports of UFOs over the nation's capital. The last article, which appeared in the Spring 2000 issue of TheAnomalist, featured the 1964 Lonnie Zamora case in Socorro, NM. In between are articles on such topics as \"What the Gov- ernment Knows,\" \"The Role of NASA in UFO Research,\" and even Eric von Daniken. His approach for most of these is that of the profes- sional journalist, which means he writes mostly from the viewpoint of the skeptic, and utilizes such terms as \"UFO buffs\" rather than \"UFO investigators.\" This is not to imply that there is anything wrong with being a skeptic- as opposed to a \"debunker\"-or that the term \"buff is derogatory in terms of the dictionary definition (though I can't help but wonder if the author would like to be re- ferred to as a \"journalism buff). Given the restraints faced by freelance writers in get- ting their stories accepted in non-UFO, non-sensationalist publications, Huyghe does a generally good job in report- ing the events and background information in a fair and informative manner. He does, however, place too much emphasis on the views of Phil Klass in an apparent effort to provide the supposed journalistic \"balance.\" Although Klass is a nice enough person, I don't see how how his off-the-cuff explanations, frequent back- tracking in \"solving\" cases, and distortion of facts can make him a reliable source. Huyghe is less kind to some of the major ufologists. For example he takes Budd Hopkins to task in comments following the article on the alleged abduction of Linda Cortile (Linda Napolitano), saying that Hopkins \"prom- ised so much and has delivered so little\" for Linda. He"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Page 16 August 2001 MUFON UFO Journal SWAMP GAS TIMES Mv TVo Decurk's on ihe UFO Boat characterizes Bruce Maccabee's work in analyzing pho- tos as \"widely respected, or at least it was until he came down in favor of the reality of the Gulf Breeze UFO pho- tographs.\" The National Institute of Science (NIDS) is described as \"controversial,\" but this is not explained. In the \"Afterward\" section, Huyghe summarizes his 54 articles by concluding, \"On such slim evidence does the reality of the UFO phenomenon rest.\" He does add, however: \"Perhaps it is all human foolishness. But I think not.\" Huyghe goes on to say, \"Even the Air Force acknowledged the existence of these truly unexplained cases.after its 20-odd years of investigting the phenomenon. And so, too, do the skeptics. But while the skeptics assert that solutions to this small percentage of cases could be found if only more in- formation about these cases were available, I refuse to throw out       , these remaining unidentifieds on such a flimsy assump- tion. We have a real phenomenon out there that defies explanations, and to dismiss it out-of-hand in this fashion will not make it go away.\" . Huyghe sees problems with some of the \"easy an- swers,\" saying, \"I think Budd Hopkins is right on target in calling the sleep-disorder explanations of abductions 'junk science,'\" adding, \"I find it difficult to dismiss all these 'occupants' or !beings' that have been reported in-con- junction with UFOs. While I can't bring myself to believe that all the different so-called 'aliens' being reported are visiting us-and have been doing so far the past 50 years- I do not view these 'alien' reports as merely the product of people's overactive imaginations either. I think that for the most part witnesses honestly describe what they experience....Something underlies these,experiences; something triggers them.\" Huyghe says he does not believe there is a conspiracy on the part of the mass media to hide facts about the UFO phenomenon, but says, \"I think the press is making a mistake in denying, for the most part, the existence of the UFO phenomenon.\" He also doubts that the government is covering up any significant information, and suggests that \"the secrecy is meant to downplay its own lack of knowledge.\" While some readers will be turned off by Huyghe's somewhat skeptical approach-in the articles more so than in his Afterward-others will see this as a hard-nosed, unemotional look at the facts as they exist. Certainly there has been too much speculation and stretching of available evidence by some people in the field, and the more conservative commentators such as Huyghe, Jenny Randies, and Dick Hall perform a valuable service in keeping things in perspective. Huyghe is, of course, an excellent writer, and the ar- ticles included in this book will keep the reader turning the pages as they review highlights of the past half century. MUFON Central European Section updates activities The Society for the Scientific Investigation of Anoma- lous Atmospherical and Radar Phenomena (MUFON- CES) has not experienced a decrease in UFO reports, as recently repeatedly announced by another German group, the Central Research Network of Anomalous Sky Phe- nomena (CENAP). However we keep receiving about two reports per month that stay unidentified. The past month we received two very typical reports-typical because the objects scared the observers. During the night from June 8th to 9th a married couple was pursued by two milky white shining objects in the sky, about as large as the moon. The witnesses were scared because they felt the objects were watching them. The oppression became even more intense as they no- ticed that the objects stopped and seemingly hovered above their house. Soon the objects became smaller and .disappeared. On May 28th a woman observed three supposedly 40 meters wide and 16 meters long triangles at about 200 meters altitude. They moved very slowly. The objects appeared \"threatening\" because the dully rumbling ob- jects were so close. UFO interest of the public is very low at the moment. Books on the subject, for example, are selling very badly. The agenda-setting media, especially nationwide subscrip- tion newspapers, are as sceptical and polemic as ever. Die Welt ran a huge debunking piece on UFOs a few days ago. Interestingly Germany's leading tabloid news- paper BILD recently speculated whether NATO had fear of UFOs after George W.

First, Mr. Silva is dead wrong in proposing any correla- tion between crop circle design and sound. There is no \"nice\" way to convey that thought to you. It's more then 180 degrees off; it's off the page. How do I know that? Here's how... In 19711 patented a device that generates a unilateral thrust, electrically. No exhausts, no heat, & when prop- erly tuned, nothing but a whirring sound is emitted. THIS IS NOT HOW UFO CRAFT ARE PRO- PELLED. I want that understood right now. BUT... Its operand happens to be represented in that same Barbury Castle formation cited by Mr. Silva as a \"harmonic fre- quency in water.\" Lets go one segment at a time where that formation is concerned. Maybe then you will recog- nize it for what it is. Look at the picture of that formation that you published. 1. Lower Left-It moves incrementally toward its axis of rotation. My innovation does also. Centrifugal force moves the \"flyweights\" away from the axis of rotation, and electromagnetic attraction incrementally implodes them towards that axis. EXACTLY AS RENDERED. 2. Right Side-Curved lines radiating outward from a central point, within a circular enclosure. This signifies (across both the cultural & language barrier) that cen- trifugal forces are created by this mechanism. It signifies rotation. 3. - Upper Left-A circle mounted upon a central shaft. This device requires a central shaft to convey the me- chanical force of rotation to the \"part that is utilizing cen- trifugal force\" AND also to the part that is incrementally moving toward the axis of rotation. NOTE the lines drawn BOTH between EACH indi- vidual segment of the operand, (The three just mentioned) AND the lines drawn between each segment TO THE CENTER where these three operands combine into ONE BASIC OPERATION. Mr. Silva couldn't have picked a worse formation then this one to attempt to promote his theories. Being the in- ventor of that device I recognized it instantly when I saw it. In fact, THAT was the crop circle that aroused my interest in crop circles. My Patent is US # 3,617,783 - Centrifugal Electromagnetic Propulsion Machine. You're on the NET - See for yourself. Better yet, a schematic of that device can be seen at: http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/ centrifugalpropulsivedevices It does LOOK like a flying saucer, but, just take my word for it, that's NOT how they propel. Tell Mr. Silva that if he wants to know what crop formations REALLY represent, to check out: http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/cropcircleresponseteam Quite a few of them are explained at that one. Or, if he doesn't like Yahoo clubs, tell him to visit: http://j_kidd.tripod.com/presentations/crop.htmlor http://www.ufos-aliens.co.uk/COSMIC_MENU.html (click on the \"crop circle\" button, he'll find me there.) Should he wonder how I know these things, tell him to visit: http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dtrapp/ sutter.htm That's enough for now. -Tom Sutler Silva replies Well, Dwight, I guess I should set this straight... I thank Mr. Sutler for his viewpoint. Unfortunately he appears to be judging the article from a single viewpoint, which is not something you can do in crop circles re- search. First of all I wish to convey that sound is not the ONLY feature inherent in crop circles: there is also plenty of evidence supporting the use of light (electromagne- tism), and possible anti-gravity features. So, the sound component is one of a larger picture. This ties in with his work, which I'm sure will please him. However, Mr. Sutler is also discussing a propulsion device he's made, and I'm discussing crop markings in this article; he confuses the two. I know there's technological information stored in crop circles, and I know the same glyphs contain esoteric in- formation (the Barbury tetrahedron is an alchemical sym- bol, too). Some glyphs can encode six levels of different information. So, please keep an open mind that your opin- ion on one particular design is just one of many possibili- ties. Secondly, I'm not certain why he mentions his inven- tion of 1971, when the crop glyph occurred in 1991. If there exists a correlation betwen his design and the crop glyph, then I am certainly all ears to his research, particu- larly as he has 20 years on the Circlemakers. I also want to point out that I am aware of another American inven- tor who DID take the Barbury Castle tetrahedron and create a device which levitates. So he's certainly not the only one who is interested in the technological angle of the design. All this is wonderful news. Thirdly, sound is a material carrier of light (EM), so to exclude sound from any creative system is to deny the very basic creative structure of the Universe, which is one point I made in my article. I am also perplexed as to how Mr. Sutler can claim no connection exists between sound and crop circles when I included an image of"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 August 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Jenny's experiments in cymatics which clearly shows the unmistakable shape of the Barbury tetrahedron AS A RESULT OF A SOUND FREQUENCY. Mr. Sutler does not comment on how ultra- and infrasound accounts for many of the physical anomalies involved in the crop circle-making process. I'm not cer- tain how he intends to dispute this research. Mr. Sutler also claims that \"I couldn't have picked a worse subject for my iheory lhan Ihe Barbury tetrahe- dron.\" Well, given the visual connection, made as a result of a SOUND FREQUENCY, I fail to see his poinl. Clearly, he is looking al the article from an electromagnetic/tech- nological background, which is fine, but that is a second aspect of Ihe research and one which would require an- other article. That does nol make me wrong. So, keep an open mind. On the positive side, he is correcl aboul Ihe technologi- cal aspecls lo Ihe design, and I for one, look forward lo receiving correspondence he may care lo offer on his research, particularly as I can pul him in touch wilh this olher inventor so Ihey can swap notes. So, Mr. Sutler, you are right. But you know, I'm right, loo. And lhal's the beauty of life-respecting that there is more lhan one side of Ihe same coin.

We have become sophisticated enough to quickly casl oul Ihe misperceptions of known phenomena and evenls and lo keep only the quality sightings.

Oh yes, Ihe UFO subjecl is slill visible, lhanks lo Ihe fringe elemenl which is ihere in force, bigger lhan ever. There are whole religions now based on the UFO and the space brothers, but they aren't of much help lo us.

Very little \"new blood\" has come into the field, and Ihe \"old blood\" is dying off or seemingly giving up. Unfortunately, whal little \"new blood\" is showing up comes in wilh a slanted perspective because of nol reading Ihe righl ma- terial, and nol seeking good advice from knowledgable people. Some of Ihis mighl be our faull for nol offering a good reading lisl or a good lisl of who is on a sensible track and who is not. What's a person lo do? We determined years ago lhal Ihe UFO is not a problem that individuals can solve by themselves, yet even with the inlemel we have a hard time getting any level of cooperation out of the remaining few who are serious aboul trying to move the field for- ward. The internel has been a dividing force ralher lhan a helpful one as you mighl expecl it lo be. On the historical side of Ihe issue there is a good work- ing group for getting the pasl slraighlened oul, bul Ihey are nol jumping in lo do new investigations in order lo keep Ihe presenl history current On Ihe other hand ihere are a few very small bul important groups working at science, bul a much bigger and belter coordinated effort is needed. Il is also clear that the public has had ils fill for awhile. As we came lo the millenium, whichever way you want to calculate it, Ihe interesl in UFOs had a heyday. The X- files, among olhers, seemed to start Ihe process. Then Ihere were several magazines. Books were coming oul on a regular basis. UFOs were Ihe Iheme of counlless advertisemenls for a very broad range of producls. The movies jumped on the band wagon-and won by general- ing lols of income. Bul now all lhal has passed, and Ihe UFO is pretty much passe. It's now a novelty shop item with toys and masks and olher paraphenalia lhal attracts kids of all ages, but detracts from a serious image. Some say \"fine\"; maybe with a little time sanity will return and we can get back lo doing business. Some say, \"Uh Oh\" ; if we don'l keep Ihe inleresl up (wilh lols of trinkels and noise), ihen il will all die com- pletely, so lei's make some noise. No, lei's nol! Lei il all calm down, and ihen lei's go wilh the remainder. Let's allow those who really want to work and explore have the space to do lhal wilhoul Ihe mounlain of clutter lhal has been there all these past 30 years or so. Although we depend on Ihe public lo get sightings, lei's not get them stirred up again. We once thoughl lhal if we could stir up the public we could stir up Ihe govern- menl, bul we know better now. We also learned that when you try to stir up the public you end up kicking over a lol of rocks that later on you wish lhal you never kicked over. You can never tell whal's going to come out from under a rock, though we have some good ideas and some good examples if we should need lo poinl Ihem oul. The hope would be lhal some of Ihese characters would crawl back under Iheir rocks, and then let's stand on Ihe rock and learn lo iread more carefully in the future. No, let's nol gel Ihe public loo involved in the nexl go round. Our job is lo learn and inform Ihe public and not to Iry lo enlist Ihem in the cause. Along Ihe way we will find some good people who will wanl to join our effort. If we lead them properly, Ihey will become wise aboul our business and lead us down a narrow road of ever expanding truth and science, and that may just lake us proudly into Ihe fulure. -Tom Deuley, MUFON Corporate Secrelary"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 2001 Page 19 UFO Center attracting visitors to Colorado's San Luis Valley Ufologists can now add the San Luis Valley in Colo- rado to such possible travel destinations as Roswell in New Mexico, the MUFON UFO Museum in Colorado, and Area 51 in Nevada. Opened to visitors on Memorial Day of last year, Judy Messoline's UFO Center is at- tracting a growing number of visitors to her 164-acre TLC Ranch near Hooper, CO, just west of the Great Dunes National Monument. Her original purpose in buying the ranch six years ago, she explains, was to raise Scotch Highland cattle-unde- terred by the fact that cattle mutilations have been a prob- lem in the valley. But she discovered that she did not have enough water to grow her own feed, and that the cost of purchasing hay was too great, so she has swapped the cattle business for the business of the unexplained. Since the San Luis Valley was already well known for UFO sightings and other strange phenomena, thanks in large part to author and researcher Chris O'Brien, Judy decided to build a tower on her ranch so that visitors- alien and domestic-would have some place to watch each other. She has also constructed a campground for those who prefer longer stays. The official hours for the UFO Center are 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., seven days a week, but the 56-year-old grand- mother will open the tower in the wee hours of the mom- ing if visitors report unusual activities, since she lives in the nearby campground. Lawn chairs, blankets, excited conversation, and much anticipation combine to make the tower a pleasant place to spend a starry night. Thus far there have been few encounters of note, but the human visitors have not complained, dropping money into Judy's donation box on a regular basis. The custom- ers, in fact, do not need sightings for entertainment, as they keep things exciting for Judy and themselves by swapping stories of their own experiences. The view from the ten-foot high platform takes in the Sangre de Cristo mountains and the Great Sand Dunes to the east, the San Juan mountains to the west, and just about everything in between in the 60-mile by 120-mile valley, which is itself at an elevation of 7,600 feet. Some of those visiting the unique site return several times, and some have become so fascinated with the area that they are considering buying property nearby. A UFO-shaped structure next to the tower contains a small gift center, which features a notebook in which visi- tors can log their stories. In addition, Judy has begun tape recording some of these stories, and is selling copies of them in the gift shop. So despite the reluctance of aliens to show up in force at the facility thus far, human visitors seem to be enjoying the new attraction. The UFO Center in the San Luis Valley, Colorado. NIDS research indicates some triangles belong to U.S. Air Force The National Institute of Discovery Science (NIDS) examined the relationship between triangular object sightings and the locations of a small subset of United States Air Force bases: i.e. the bases under the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Mobility Command (AMC). Combined, these two commands control the lo- gistics of troop and equipment deployment within the United States and internationally. NIDS found an interesting scatter of triangular object sighting locations around air corridors between AFMC and AMC bases. In order to examine the integrity of its data, NIDS ob- tained the data on more than 450 additional reports on triangular aircraft sightings between 1990-2001 from MUFON (Wendy Ban and Don Weatherby) and from Larry Hatch, who currently manages one of the largest UFO databases in the world (see www.jps.net/larryhat/ index.html). Both these databases fulfill the requirement of being totally separate from the NIDS data collection. NIDS plotted the sighting locations on maps of the United States and then superimposed the locations of the AMC and AFMC bases. It found that (a) the broad trend of many triangular craft sighting locations occurring between AFMC and AMC bases in both MUFON and Hatch databases is consistent with NIDS' previous report and (b) a corridor encompassing the plains states that is devoid of either triangular craft sightings or AFMC/AMC bases emerges from both MUFON and Hatch databases. This corridor is also consistent with the previously published NIDS data. Based on these data from over 500 eyewitnesses (as- suming minimal overlap between three databases), NIDS hypothesizes that the U.S. Air Force has been flying large triangular or deltoid shaped aircraft between AFMC or AMC bases.

Greco, Ph.D. . Editor's Note: The following is a summary of re- sponses by witnesses to the \"Williamsport (PA) Wave\" oU991-92, ten years after the fact. The sur- vey was begun by Dr/Greco in February of this year, and completed in May. It is based on 11 responses from the 31 questionnaires sent to the witnesses (35.5 %). More detailed statistics are.available from Dr. Greco. The following conclusions may be drawn from this survey:   , . .  • - Health questions The general health of the viewers was good before their sightings. Three (3) persons attributed some malady to their sight- ing.   ...'....,'-. These three reported that their maladies were effec- tively treated, but one reported a recurring infection-a severe nose bleed which required a five-day hospital pe- riod and recurring visits for treatment; and one reported severe emotional distress involving hearing \"sky noises\" and affinity for night commotions, which may have been associated with UFO activity in the area. The third did not state the nature of the malady. None of the viewers reported that they were now un- der a doctor's care for any maladies incurred during the sighting, except as related above. , . Comments: Further investigation would need to be done on those persons which reported maladies to ensure that they were actually caused by the sightings. However, in lieu of the fact that eleven persons reported they were in good health before the sighting, it can be stated with a high degree of probability that these maladies were a. di- rect result of their sightings. Effect on beliefs Nine of the eleven persons reporting a sighting belong to a religious faith; two are atheists or non-believers. Viewing of the sightings did not change their belief in their faith.    ••.... : . Although viewers stated their belief in their religious faith did not change, four said it made belief stronger, and seven said it made them wonder about life on other plan- ets   . • •'•':•.,• Comments: The phrase \"did not change my religious belief?' 7 may have been mistakingly structured and should possibility have been \"did not change any of my religious tenets.\" ,. Effects on personality , There were 20% of those viewing the sightings who reported a change in one or more of the foil owing areas: being more tolerant, more friendly, more charitable, more willing to volunteer for charitable causes, or to show a different attitude toward their fellow man. One person stated there was a personality change for the better, four stated there was a change for the worse, and six persons stated that there was no change in their personalities because of their sightings. Nine stated the sightings had a positive effect on them. Interest in universe There were ten persons who reported more interest in the universe after their sightings. All eleven viewers re- ported they were more interested in science programs on TV than before the sightings. Four of the viewers stated they are more interested in NASA space launches. , . When and if the alleged UFO cover-up is finally re- vealed, three of the viewers responding stated it would be good for Planet Earth, and five stated that it would not be good, and nine viewers thought that great changes would occur in all phases of life on Earth. Alien visits to Planet Earth were troubling to four of the viewers. Release of data This survey shows that five of the those who reported sightings still do not desire that their personal data and data for the sighting be released for public consumption. This figure would rise to 61.54% If restrictions are counted, since two of the viewers stated that the data could be released, but with certain restrictions. Hill says fast travel in space possible Most scientists believe the reason UFQs cannot be here is because of the great distance between star sys- tems, but NASA scientist Paul Hill in his book Unconventual Flying Objects provides the mathemati- cal formulas to show that the travel time between planets in various solar systems for the occupants is less than it took for our ancestors to reach America. The equations have been checked by the Langley Re- search Center, and interstellar mission profiles can take only weeks or a few months. -For example, Hill states, \"It is possible for an interstel- lar trip to be very short. The trip from our nearest neigh- bor, Alpha Centuri, a triple star system 4.3 light years away, made by accelerating at 140 g to av/c of 0.9999 is accomplished from a standing start to a standing finish in 6 weeks, 0.115 year.\" (P. 272)"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 2001 Page 21 View from Britain Jenny Randies Regression hypnosis in Britain: Part II, The Moratorium (Continued from July MUFON UFO Journal) In 1988 BUFORA's investigation team got together and on a free vote of all its investigators decided on a five- year moratorium to stop using regression in any form, even with medical supervision. We wanted to make clear that we were fearing what might happen-that some witness could be left with either physical or mental scars as a result of being subjected to hypnosis. We also believed that by mak- ing this voluntary decision to quit this kind of work we might make others think twice about what had become a virtual automatic step to take with any close en- counter case. By now my personal views on the matter had hardened as well. I had seen, for example, how under hypnosis witnesses could be led (often inno- cently) by the slightest use of some word that took them off into a trail of fantasy. In one particular incident a complex story about a UFO having escalators on board followed a curious remark by an inexperienced regressionist, puzzled because the wit- ness had reported the aliens merely switching levels with- out any obvious transport. I recall sitting gobsmacked as the regression therapist, clearly of the opinion that some means to get from floor to floor was essential, uninentionally led the witness into describing the inside of the UFO as it if was Macy's de- partment store! How often, I began to wonder, does this happen with- out being spotted? I started to look at transcripts from hypnosis sessions and realised it was not that rare. Of course, you could never prove that any image of- fered up \"was\" fantasy. Maybe UFOs really do have es- calators on them! Yet if someone regresses to last week and says they went to the supermarket dressed as a clown, you can actively prove whether such a forgotten recall is true or not by doing investigation. People will have either seen that \"clown\" or not. If not, you are likely to conclude that the event never happened. But if someone says they were floated through their bedroom into a spaceship, past experience shows there is virtually no chance you will be able to get evidence to verify that this really happened. Since hypnosis can and does generate fantasy and memory together, then how do you know what you are getting out of a case? Concerns grow deeper To test this, I had conducted an experiment (reported in detail in one of my papers to the MIT symposium in 1992). For this I was regressed by a clinical psychologist to a genuine LITS sighting in August 1978.1 saw this viv- idly under hypnosis, and even more so in subsequent dreams. I added lots of things that my conscious recall does not include as part of the event. I was (and am) properly skeptical of these \"new\" tales, but I know that it would be easy to assume that these additional images \"were\" memories rather than fantasies. And, just like many witnesses I have met who have un- dergone regression, I might then be persuaded to accept the reality of something that in truth I have virtually no basis to know is real. After I had quizzed a few witnesses who had under- gone regression armed with the above personal insight, I found a few willing to admit that they didn't know if their hypnotic recall had any basis in truth, but had kept this to themselves for fear of offending the UFOlogists and doc- tors who had put so much effort into their case. So here came the rub. In the regression experiment I was also regressed to events around the time of my LITS sighting that were factual \"and\" checkable. I had long since consciously forgotten them, but they were presum- ably somewhere in my head-merely not recalled-and, unlike the UFO incident, I could investigate my hypnotic description of these and establish if what I said under hypnosis was true or not true. What happened? In many instances I gave completely false information under hypnosis for checkable things like the calendar or time of day. I did come up with some correct and surprising recall. But there was so much mis- information from this checkable data that realistically I had to accept that probably at least 50% of any uncheckable UFO sighting recall was probably wrong too. Maybe even more. Heavy contamination possible So I saw the real danger of hypnosis first hand. It is not that it cannot work and may not provide some real hidden memories. Very likely it sometimes does. But it was that these memories are at best heavily contami- nated with false information. Since we cannot easily differentiate which is which in what are unverifiable UFO stories, then UFOlogy is form- ing opinions about its primary cases through data that is far from reliable. And in the process (as I saw) poten- tially causing witnesses to accept recall events as true that may be no such thing. To me, that is sacrificing the welfare of the witness for"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Page 22 August 2001 MUFON UFO Journal our own selfish desire to learn more, and I believed then (and still believe now) that it was a step too far. A complete ban The BUFORA moratorium was ratified and extended, and eventually the investigation team voted on it to be- come an official ban. The code of practice used by BUFORA was modified accordingly, and 13 years later the group still does not allow regression during its cases. There has been some discussion amidst members who would prefer it otherwise. I know that some American researchers have also commented that BUFORA is let- ting British witnesses down in adopting this stance. But I respectfully disagree. The ban on regression that I helped steer through BUFORA is in my view one of the group's finest moments. BUFORA is not alone. In the UK the net-based inves- tigation team, UFOIN, has an even stricter version of the code of practice, and also has a total ban on the use of regression. I also believe that similar restrictions apply in other European countries amongst some of the leading groups. So this may be a view in which the consensus is changing. There are, of course, well known researchers in the UK who support regression. My co-author in many books, Peter Hough, is one who does. He has written a book on his alien contact case work (via regression) with the thera- pist that he works alongside (Dr Moyshe Kalman), and I have sat in on several of the sessions in this psychologist's offices. I do that so that I can keep up to date with the position now, rather than base my opinions on what I saw many years ago. But whenever I have a twinge of doubt, I think back over all the experience of hypnotic regression that has made me aware of its less than trustworthy nature. This starts with that very first session 23 years ago when I watched as a UFOlogist regressed a witness to the UFO sighting and I was able as a result to talk to the alien they now claimed that they had met. The alien had \"taken over\" the body of the witness and was answering my questions instead of the witness doing so! I sat on the long train journey home from that session trying to work out what had just happened. Had I really spoken with an alien? Well, perhaps. I knew it was not inpossible. But did I believe that I had? Frankly, no. I was convinced then (and am even more persuaded now) that I was talking not to an alien, but to part of the subcon- scious of the witness who was (quite innocently and likely without their knowledge) pretending to be an alien. Real dangers hammered home Once I had digested that implication and realised that if I didn't know for sure what was going on in this case, then how could I expect the witness to do so, the real dangers were fast hammered home. Hypnosis here instills into the mind long-term, perhaps forever, information that to us is the source of excited debate and potentially useful (although also potentially misleading) background to a close encounter case. But we can move on to the next case. The witness has no such luxury. We have altered their perception of the uni- verse by way of our brief sojourn into their affairs, and in some way changed their lives. Just think it through this way. If an incident has oc- curred and there is missing time (of which of course even in the UK such examples still get reported), there are two basic possible reasons. Reason one for the time lapse is that it is an illusion (the witness may misrecall the flow of time, or they may have been unconscious or asleep-or in fact there could be several other reasons why there really was not a time lapse). Reason two is that a period of memory really is miss- ing. In that case it is being blocked from conscious recall by one of two forces: the witness' own mind (as in amne- sia of a trauma that it is healthy not to recall) or some outside force, such as an alien deliberately seeking to block memory. Barriers magically released? I have always had a problem with the idea that these aliens are so marvellous that they readily block a witness from having recall, but in such an inept way that a young UFO buff with no training in hypnosis whatsoever can say a few words and almost magically release the barri- ers. There is a contradiction here that at least begs the question-is that what really happens? But even on the assumption that aliens could block a witness' memory in this haphazard fashion, that is just one out of the three possible explanations for the time lapse as just indicated. By assuming that it is true and performing a dubious technique like hypnosis to act upon that assumption we are not playing the odds very wisely here. For two-thirds of the potential explanations make the search for a mind blocking alien presence misguided. Besides which, if there is a hidden memory, and it is at least as likely that this has been blocked from recall by the witness themselves, then their own subconscious has chosen this-perhaps due to its traumatic nature. If so, then do we have the right to even contemplate uncorking the genie? After all, it is not the investigator's mind that must live with the consequences.

California. The theme, \"2001 - Joining the Cosmic Neighborhood\" was a difficult one to address, and it was a challenge for the speakers to put their work into that context. The Orange County group spent the past year in an intense planning, advertising and symposium organizing ef- fort. One of the things they tried to demonstrate was their willingness to try new ap- proaches to almost every facet of the event. Symposium Artwork A special note of thanks goes to Roberta Puhalski and Robert E. Nelson for the beautiful artwork they provided for the cover of the MUFON 2001 International UFO Symposium Proceedings and for the symposium souvenir poster. It truly captures the theme of the symposium. Unity in Diversity The field of ufology is fortunate in that UFO reports come from people of every nationality, race, sex, color, creed, economic status and age. This rich mixture of reporting gives us a chance to investigate and evaluate reports in the broadest of terms and with the realization that this is no small mystery. Since 1947 people have struggled with this mystery, collecting the evidence, writing research papers and books, giving public talks, fighting for release of government documents, and volunteering their talents to expose and resolve the mystery. As a result, there exists a mass of evidence that is distributed around the globe that is cred- ible and reliable; however, it is not unified. For many years NICAP, APRO, MUFON and hun- dreds of other groups have carried the investigations for- ward. Many of these groups have come and gone for one reason or another without solving the mystery. It is my opinion that one of the reasons that a full measure of success has evaded us is due to'th'e lack of unity among the groups. Speaking with a voice and resources of a few hundred or even a few thousand people is a valiant John Schuessler effort, but isn't as likely to succeed as speaking with a voice of several hundred thousand people. We need to rally the forces. Some of the anti-UFO buffs quickly respond to UFO reports by \"inventing\" answers, couching them in so-called scientific terms, and then claiming that nothing real is go- ing on. This is a direct insult to the thousands of credible witnesses making the reports in good faith, and serves no useful purpose. Unfortunately, some long-time UFO researchers are doing similar damage to the field by attacking the charac- ter and capabilities of everyone they do not agree with. Even though they have not found the answers themselves, they seem to want to limit what others say and do. They spend a lot of time on Internet sites telling each other how bad everyone else is and what they think everyone else should be doing. A lot of what they say is babble at best and slander and libel at the other end of the spectrum. It would be more beneficial if they would put all that energy into some positive actions. MUFON is fortunate to have Dwight Connelly as editor of the MUFON UFO Journal. He struggles monthly to give a broad and unbiased view of the UFO mystery, a view that is commensurate with the diversity of MUFON's membership. He upholds the standards of good taste on what is published in the Journal, and rec- ognizes the value of presenting UFO reports, results of investigations, and scientifically-based research, rather than ad hominem attacks on others in the field. MUFON has enough good material to publish that it does not need to publish articles that are aimed at damag- ing MUFON or any other organization; denigrating the character of any individual; aimed at potential slander or libel; or designed to stir up hate, mistrust or rancor. That sort of material is fodder for the tabloids and the guttural websites. Very seldom is a major social, technological or political effort successful if the very people claiming to be for it do not put their petty personal feelings behind them and get totally behind the effort. Otherwise, it is simply a case of divide and conquer. In the case of ufology, we will lose the battle if some measure of unity is not achieved soon. New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director of Field Investigator Training, has announced the following Field Investigator Trainees have completed the Field Investigator's Exam and are now MUFON Field Investigators: Wendy DeVore, West St. Paul, MN; Douglas E. Egolf, Fort Wayne, IN; Robert E. Finn, Ballston Lake, NY; Wayne E. Gracey; Glenville, PA; Albert Kurz, San Francisco, CA; and Mischa Stuhler-Safdie, West Covina, CA."}]
