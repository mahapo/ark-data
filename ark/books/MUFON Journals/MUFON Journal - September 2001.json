Although Betty says she has so many interests that \"UFOs are way down on my list,\" she has seldom been far from the UFO spotlight these past forty years, with an estimated 300 radio interviews, numer- ous lectures, several appearances on TV, and college speaking tours. In addition, she reports that she has seen hundreds of UFOs and photographed at least 200 since her ab- duction, mostly in the rural area near Kingston, about 20 miles southwest of Portsmouth, where she still lives. \"Where there used to be open fields, there are now houses,\" she laments. When my wife and I visited her in 1999 she kindly set up a 35mm projector and displayed a number of photos of strange lights. She also showed us the dress she was wearing when she was abducted, and the pink stains are still visible. \"Maybe it was a way of disin- fecting me,\" she speculates. Betty's home is not so far from downtown Ports- mouth in a neat middle class neighborhood. Although the home and lot are small, she proudly showed us her five chickens-all named-and a fancy rooster with purple skin and no comb, which she got from a man who is an organic farmer. Wild animals, such as rac- coons, know they can get a handout from her. She also had at least two cats to keep her company, but only one now survives. Naturally, she has a number of UFO books in her li- brary, including, of course, the well-known account of the case, The Interrupted Journey by John Fuller (1966). She also has a few copies of her own book, A Common Sense Approach to UFOs, which she self- published in 1995, and which she feels has been ig- nored by the mainstream UFO organizations. She says her book originated when she began writ- Betty Hill still has the dress, stained with a pink powdery material, she was wearing when abducted 40 years ago."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 September 2001 MUFON UFO Journal ing \"a few pages of my experiences to make a booklet for relatives, friends, and other people who were inter- ested. As I wrote I discovered I had too much for a booklet, so with some help from friends, it got published as a book.\" Although she believes that there have been a limited number of abducdons in addition to her own, she is con- vinced that many of those claiming such experiences are either honestly mis- taken or are lying in order to get attention. Betty is very suspicious of hypnosis, as currently conducted by UFO re- searchers, despite the use of medical hypnosis in her own case, and does not believe anyone has been abducted more than once. She is also not convinced that aliens can move through walls. One of the more inter- esting aspects of the case involves the star map which Betty saw while on board, and which she was able to draw under post-hypnotic suggestion. * Not only did researcher Marjorie Fish find a match with known star systems, following the discov- ery of additional stars some years later, but Betty re- ports an additional strange experience. Betty says she duplicated the star map on a 4 by 8 sheet of ply wood, using flashing Christmas tree lights to .mark bach star, and set the display up \"iri an area where UFOs were known to fly regularly.\" She reports that \"every morning when Fchecked this map I found , the same light removed, lying on the ground. I discov- ered it was slightly out of its correct position, so I cor- rected it, and the light stayed where I put it after that.\" In spite of the initial problems which the couple expe- rienced in dealing with the abduction, Betty views the incident as positive. \"I feel that I have been honored by getting to meet astronauts from another planet,\" she explains. \"They did not mean to harm us. When they stuck that needle in my navel they said it would not hurt, and they were very surprised when I experienced pain. They quickly relieved the pain. They just wanted to see how differ- ent we are from them.\" She also feels that the resulting publicity generated .by her abduction has been generally positive. \"My hori- zons have certainly been broadened,\" she notes:, \"From the first day that John Fuller's book was released, we were on TV programs, and we met some of the top people in the entertainment industry. Barney enjoyed carrying a copy of our book and getting it autographed. We stayed at the best hotels and ate in the best restau- rants. We were given tickets to Broadway shows and driven around in limousines, meeting a great many inter- esting people.\" When they made the movie, \"The UFO Incident,\" the Hills got to meet with Estelle Parsons. \"The movie was good,\" she says, \"but the aliens did not look like the ones we saw, and the film didn't show all of the medical procedures.\" After Barney died of a stroke in 1969, Betty contin- ued to appear on radio and TV, give lectures, and grant interviews-a process that has continued until fairly re- r cently. Now, at 82 with some health problems, Betty has been forced to slow down. Even without the UFO connection, her life would probably, make a good book.. At the age of 21, for ex- ample, she and her first husband adopted three children, aged 3, 5, and 7, when she was only 21 years old. She had an active career as a social worker, and volun- teered a great deal of time to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Barney, a postal worker, was also quite active in civil rights organizations. They were an inter-racial couple at a time when this was rare. She and Barney had been married only a year and a half when their abduction occurred, and they were on their way home from a delayed honeymoon. From that point on, the UFO phenomenon played a large role in their lives, and after 40 years the Betty and Barney Hill incident still ranks at or near the top of credible abduc- tion cases. The Hill case revisited For those new to the UFO scene, the following is a brief, incomplete recap of the famous incident: Betty, 41, and Barney, 39, who had been married for about two years (Barney was Betty's second husband), were returning from a delayed honeymoon in Montreal. As they drove through the White Mountains of New Hampshire with their dog Delsey, they noticed a bright light to the left of the moon and above Jupiter. At one point the object crossed the face of the moon, and Barney suggested it might be an airplane, but Betty ob- served an unconventional lighting configuration. Her sister had described a sighting four years earlier, and her mother had also seen UFOs. Nearby Pease Air Force Base would later confirm that there was some sort of object in the air at the time the Hills saw the object. Since they were the only people on the road, and Barney had now become became aware that the object pacing them was not a plane, he stopped the car and re- trieved a .22 pistol from the trunk of the vehicle, then resumed driving. They took turns looking at it through binoculars, and determined that the object was spinning and moving in a step-like pattern. It was disc-shaped with a band of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 2001 Page 5 lights running along the edge, and there was a red light on each side of the ob- ject. The Hills' dachshund, Delsey, was whimpering and cowering. Two miles north of North Woodstock the object descended and hovered less that 100 feet in the air and only a few hundred feet away. The object was no longer spinning, and a blue-white fluorescent glow was coming from a row of windows on the side of the ob- ject. Barney stopped the car, got out, and braced the binoculars on the roof to get a better view. The object crossed the road in front of them and hovered above a field to their left, then moved to within 75 feet. Barney moved closer for a better look at the object, which appeared to be about 60 to 65 feet in diameter and 15 to 20 feet high. Even without the binoculars he could see several entities in shiny black uniforms behind the windows, in- cluding one individual looking back at him. The uniformed individuals seemed to be pulling levers, while the individual at the window maintained eye contact with Barney. Barney pan- icked and ran for the car, shrieking that they were about to be captured, and the couple tore off down the road. Suddenly there was a loud beeping sound from the back of the car which shook the vehicle, and Betty and Barney felt a tingling sensation and be- came drowsy. Later, passing through Ashland, they again heard the beeping from the trunk. Betty turned to Barney and said, \"Tell me, Barney. Now do you believe in flying saucers?\" He re- plied, \"Don't be ridiculous.\" Betty ex- plains, \"I knew he had forgotten the capture.\" This second series of beeps appar- ently restored the Hills to full con- sciousness. When they reached home, dawn was breaking. When they checked their clock they realized that the trip had taken two hours longer than it should have, even al- lowing for their three stops at Cannon Mountain, The Flume, and Indian Head. Both felt clammy and dirty. The binocular strap which Barney had around his neck was broken. Some- thing in the area of his lower abdomen bothered him, and he checked his genitals with a mirror.

There"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 September 2001 MUFON UFO Journal were several silver-dollar sized circles on the back of the car, which had not been noticed before, and the tops of Barney's shoes showed unusual scrape marks. Both Betty's and Barney's watches had permanently stopped running. Although both Betty and Barney were frightened by the experience, they seemed to have, in Betty's words, \"a compelling urge to return to the spot where this oc- curred in the hope that we may again come in contact with this object.\" On their first trip back to the mountains to try to lo-. cate the site of the incident, they returned home to find a pile of dried leaves on the kitchen table, according to Betty, and \"in the leaves were the blue earrings that I was wearing when the incident occurred. That told me they knew where I lived.\" Following the sighting, Betty became concerned about Barney, who was upset because he could not re- member what happened after they encountered a roadblock. They both recalled the close encounter with the UFO south of Indian Head and the series of beeps, and they had a vague memory of a roadblock. Betty recalled a sharp turn off of Route 3, and they both remembered what seemed to be the moon set- ting. Later they would be informed that it had already set. This seemed to be all that Barney could recall re- garding the event which had caused him to become so hysterical. Betty had experienced a series of five straight nights of lifelike nightmares, which added to the puzzle, so she tried to find out more about UFOs. She read some UFO literature, and on Sept. 26 wrote to Donald Keyhoe, author of The Flying Saucer Conspiracy (1955) and director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), asking for sources of additional information and briefly describing their experience. Keyhoe forwarded the letter to Rich- ard Hall, secretary of NICAP, who asked Walter N. Webb to investigate. This type of case was quite rare at that time, and there were few guidelines to follow. However, it was clear that the witnesses were quite respectable and credible. Barney was a dispatcher at the Boston Post Office, and Betty was a social worker for the state of New Hampshire. Barney served on the advisory board of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, and Betty volunteered her services evenings to the local chapter of the NAACP. Since they were an interracial couple, it seemed unlikely that they would intentionally create a situation which would bring more attention to them- selves. Eventually the Hills decided to undergo medical hypnosis. Betty had mentioned this in the Sept. 26 let- ter to Keyhoe, since as a social worker she was famil- iar with its use in recovering memory after a traumatic experience. Later the use of hypnosis was reportedly endorsed by Capt. Ben Swett of Pease AFB, who seemed intrigued by the missing time reported by the Hills. The hypnosis took place during the first six months of 1964, more than two years after the incident. They were hypnotized separately, with double amnesia induced by Dr. Benjamin Simon, a well-known Boston psychia- trist and experienced hypnotist. Dr. Simon was so skeptical of UFOs that he refused to read explanatory material on the subject provided by Webb, and initially hypothesized that Barney had been contaminated by Betty's dreams. His final conclusion, however, was that he had no explanation for their expert ence. Nevertheless, he was convinced that both Betty and Barney thought they had been abducted. Although Betty had recalled much of the abduction experience in dreams, the hypnotic sessions brought out additional details. Barney's descriptions were more brief, but, significantly, he recalled details that were not in Betty's dreams or related by her under hypnosis. Betty's hypnosis contradicted some of the details of her dream experience. For example, the entities in her dreams had large noses and black hair, but the entities that she remembered under hypnosis were the same as what Barney saw. One of the key elements of the abduction was the in- sertion of a needle into Betty's navel, which was suppos- edly some sort of pregnancy test. It was initially painful (apparently surprising the entities), but the pain was quickly relieved when the leader waved his hand in front of her eyes. Another significant element was the \"star map\" which Betty was shown, and which she was able to recreate through post-hypnotic suggestion. Using her drawing, researcher Marjorie Fish was able to create a three-di- mensional mockup, but only after astronomers discov- ered some previously unknown stars several years later. The star map suggests that Zeta Reticulus was the home base of the entities. There was even a bit of humor in the encounter as the entities tried to understand why Barney's teeth would come out (they were false teeth), but Betty's wouldn't. The hypnosis therapy was successful, and the Hills were grateful that the stress brought about by then\" expe- rience was now gone. However, a story on the front page of The Boston Traveler by John H. Luttrell, based on a talk the Hills had given to a UFO group in 1962 and a tape of an interview with UFO investigators following the hypnosis, quickly thrust the couple into the spotlight. Then, in 1966, Saturday Review columnist John Fuller convinced the Hills and Dr. Simon to assist him with the best-selling book, The Interrupted Journey, which was later made into a movie starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons. Barney died suddenly on Feb. 25, 1969, of a cerebral hemorrahage at the age of 46, and Betty continued to share their experiece on radio, TV, in lectures, in periodi- cals, and in her own book."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 2001 Page 7 A special memory of Betty & Barney Hill Niece recalls the episode Kathy Marden By Kathleen Marden I was thirteen years old on Sept. 20, 1961, and had just begun my academic year at D.J. Bakie School in Kingston, New Hampshire. Back at home on my grandparent's small poultry and dairy farm there was a feeling of foreboding. Hurri- cane Esther had begun to whirl her way up the eastern seashore, and if her intensity continued we were in line for a direct hit. But Esther would prove to be little more than a nui- sance, leaving small branches, leaves, and pine needles strewn about the ground to be cleaned up when her rain subsided. My mother, a full time homemaker and crafter, stood in the kitchen at her ironing board laboring over half a bushel of wrinkled laundry when I arrived home from school. I sat at the kitchen table filling her in on the events of my school day. Suddenly, the ringing phone broke the ambience of the moment. My mother picked up the receiver and be- gan to speak while I listened to the one-sided conversa- tion. Gripped by a sense of urgency, she hung up the phone and immediately dialed our neighbor. Irma, in an attempt to speak to Irma's physicist husband. She then phoned my Aunt Betty, her oldest sister, and told her to take a compass outside to check the car for radiation. Finally, I had my mother's attention and with a profound sense of curiosity I listened while she related the details of my aunt and uncle's UFO sighting and the beeping sounds on the trunk of their 1957 Chevy Bel Aire. I had learned the previous year in science class that Earth was the only planet with a habitat capable of sup- porting life, but I wondered, how could this be? It was impossible. But my mother quickly offered her own point of view. With shock and wonderment I listened while she described her own UFO sighting. She and my Aunt Norma were driving south on Route 125 in South Kingston when they witnessed a huge glowing object hovering over a field adjacent to the road. It was stationary and seemed to be discharg- About the author Kathleen Marden is not only Betty's niece, but also Director of Field Investigator Training for MUFON. ing smaller objects. She stopped the car and ran to a nearby house, and moments later, she and several neighbors watched in amazement as the smaller objects joined the larger one, which rose vertically and disap- peared. My maternal grandfather had aroused my curiosity about space due to his interest in the American and So- viet satellite programs. Several minutes after Betty's first call, our phone rang again. By this time my father's best friend had ar- rived for his daily afternoon visit. Buz worked as a ma- chinist during the day and had also served as the chief of police in the small neighboring village of Newton. As Betty spoke, my mother hastily relayed her mes- sage to us. She said that when Betty ventured outside to inspect her car she found several small circles on the trunk lid located in the area where she and Barney had heard beeping sounds the previous evening. Betty thoroughly experimented with the compass, placing it over the hood, on the doors, roof, wheels, trunk and rear of the car. It had fluctuated on several areas of the car, particularly over the hood, but it inex- plicably began to spin in circles over the marks on the trunk. She wondered whether or not she should report this UFO encounter to the authorities, and as circumstance would have it, she reported it to Buz. He advised her to make a formal report to Pease Air Force Base. My mother told her that we would pay her a visit as soon as possible. Our Visit An air of excitement filled my home that evening. My parents were making plans to drive to Portsmouth as soon as Hurricane Esther's winds and rain subsided. School would be cancelled, and Dad agreed to shorten his workday in order to drive us the twenty or so miles from Kingston to Portsmouth. Finally we arrived in Portsmouth, and Betty greeted us at the door. With excited anticipation we expected to listen to a full account of Betty and Barney's UFO en- counter.  ' We were disappointed to hear that Barney was not his usual boisterous self, and that we would have to"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Page 8 September 2001 MUFON UFO Journal leave him alone. I vaguely recall that he may have been awaiting an important phone call. Barney was the ste- reotype of every kid's favorite uncle, and we always looked forward to a pleasurable visit with him. Through his interaction with us we knew for certain that we were valued family members. He took an inter- est in our school and home activities, played chess and checkers with us, and helped to teach us social etiquette and proper behavior. He encouraged us to do well in school and to take part in school government and sports; and he joked with us and made us laugh. Today we would have to contain ourselves and leave Barney in quiet anticipation. My father joined Barney for a quiet conversation in the living room while Betty, compass in hand, led us to the street where her 1957 blue and white Chevy Bel Aire was parked. My mother, brother Glenn, and I peered curiously at several highly polished half dollar size circles while we took turns lift- ing my youngest brother, Tommy, high enough to see. Betty demonstrated the car's effect upon the com- pass, starting at the hood and running it over the side, back and trunk. We watched, as the needle spun wildly over the spots, but not on the side. My mother spied Glenn and myself futilely attempting to rub the spots away and cautioned us not to touch them for safety reasons. My mother, who is careful not to jump to erroneous conclusions, suggested that perhaps something inside the trunk was having an effect on the compass. Betty opened it and we looked at the bag of fertilizer that she had purchased but not removed. I don't remember how the needle reacted when she placed it over the bag. My mother was again becoming apprehensive about our possible exposure to radioactive material, so we were quickly shuffled back into the house. We found seats in the large living room on the opposite side of the room from my father and Barney. Betty explained the details of her sighting while we listened intently, asking questions to satisfy our curiosity. This was a day that would irrevocably change the course and focus of my life. Prior to this day, I lived with the perception that nothing could violate my sense of security. New Hampshire was relatively crime free. We left our doors unlocked, walked the streets at night, and had no need to worry about personal safety. My parents provided a positive and secure home environ- ment, one free from worry about war, danger, and injus- tice. Suddenly this feeling of security was shattered when I learned that alien beings lurked in the darkness, pouncing upon unsuspecting motorists. Nighttime now signified danger,, and I approached it with great fear and trepidation. A new bedroom check became a nightly routine. Before retiring, with a rapidly beating heart and a flushed face, I timidly checked my closet and under my bed. The dolls that I had relegated to storage soon found their way back to my bed to Betty and Barney with their dachshund Delsey. (From The Interrupted Journey. Dial Press, 1966; Jeeves Studios.) serve as a type of security blanket while I slept. Too frightened to amble idly from my light switch to my bed. I raced in semidarkness aided by a night-light, threw myself upon the bed, and covered my body with blan- kets, head and all. There was nothing that I could do to insulate myself from the reality of what happened to my aunt and uncle. Betty clearly remembered a close encounter, a rhythmic pattern of beeping sounds, a large glowing ob- ject on the ground, and a roadblock. Barney told my fa- ther an equally consistent story. Their watches sustained irreparable damage, Barney's shoes were badly scuffed, his leather binocu- lar strap was broken, Betty's new dress was torn and covered with a pink powdery substance, and there were strange spots on the trunk of their car. They felt con- taminated, and Barney's upper back was injured. Clearly, there was no reason to question the validity of their account. They were clear and lucid. Intrusion My next clear memory of the unfolding of this event occurred within, I would say. a month's time.

While they spent the previous day exploring their Canada route through the White Mountains someone had broken into their home. They were shocked to find a withered pile of leaves on the dining room table. Upon closer inspection they discovered Betty's blue earrings, the ones she wore on Sept. 19-the ones that had been missing since that day. My father suggested that they should install dead bolt locks on their front and back doors, and they discussed the procedure for ac- complishing this. .. .,'-'•. The dead bolt locks were soon installed but they did not prevent intruders from entering the Hill home. Over the next several years odd and harassing tricks were employed against them-their thermostats were moved to their wannest setting, and an inverted bowl of dirty ice (without the bowl) was left on their breakfast bar.  , Shortly after Barney's death, the tax information that Betty had compiled for her accountant was stolen. Sev- eral weeks later, Betty returned home from work to dis- cover its return, scattered in a path of litter throughout her apartment. I, a college student at the time, resided in the base- ment apartment below her apartment. My attention had been drawn momentarily away from my studying by footsteps in Betty's apartment, but I assumed that she had stopped, in briefly during her workday. When she arrived home from work I climbed the flight of stairs to greet her as I always did. We were both shocked and dismayed to find this new evidence of harassment. As I recall, this event marked the end of someone's private war against the Hills. The harassment ceased, and life at Betty's house regained a sense of normalcy. My grief-stricken aunt put her life back together, and with a great sense of determination and feistiness de- fended what she knew was the truth. But debunkers continued to disseminate misinforma- tion designed to cloud and distort the public's view of the true story. Later, writers and television producers would use this inaccurate account when they presented the Betty and Barney Hill story. As the true account faded from the public's memory it was replaced by a sketchy representation designed to cast doubt upon the reality of the UFO experience itself. I, along with several UFO researchers, steadfastly wrote to TV stations, writers, and newspapers, pointing out their mistakes and referring them to accurate sources. However, a retraction was never printed, and not once have I received a reply. Sept. 19 marks forty years since my aunt and uncle were paced, taken under control, and captured in New Hampshire's White Mountains. It is high time for the truth to be restored. Dutch investigators report addition to crop circle while they were there Three researchers from the Dutch Centre for Crop Circle Studies (DCCS) visiting the \"Scorpion\".crop circle near Stadskanaal, Holland, on Aug. 7 reportedly experienced the creation of an addition to the circle as they were investigating the formation. The three are Robert Boerman, Jan-Willem Bobbink, and Eltjo Haselhoff. The investigators report that they had basically com- pleted their sampling and photographing of the forma- tion, consisting of eight circles of decreasing diameter, when Boerman decided to make one last trip to the end of the formation. He says he was astonished to see that the formation had gained an additional circle, 150 cm in diameter, with an unusual central tuft of densely intertwined stems. The air above the new ring was reportedly warmer than the surrounding area, and when Boerman entered the small circle he felt pain in his legs and decided to leave it immediately. When the other two researchers arrived, Haselhoff reported pain in the ligaments of his left hand, which he had put inside the fresh circle. He also noticed after leaving the circle that the bat- tery of his digital camera was completely empty, even though just a short time earlier the camera had indicated 35 minutes of available time. A news reporter who ar- rived less than an hour later reported that the same thing occurred with his camera. Later, when Haselhoff tried to download the numer- ous photos of the formation from his camera, all of the files were severely corrupted and could not be down- loaded. However, photos taken by Boerman were apparently not affected, and they reportedly showed that the last ring of the formation had not been present when he had shot photos 45 minutes prior to finding the addition.

The transition will be diffi- cult, the rewards many.\" In discussing \"where we should look\" for other civiliza- tions, Friedman suggests that we \"should search for colonizing in- terstellar traveling civilizations in the neighborhood of sun-like stars that are much older than the sun and have another sun-like star relatively close.\" '  , He says that the star map drawn by Betty Hill and delineated by Marjorie Fish provides \"a fairly obvious choice\" of Zeta 1 and Zeta 2\" Reticuli, \"which are one year apart from each other, 37 light years from our sun, and a billion years older than our sun.\" He notes that some \"noisy negativists\" falsely claim that one of these two stars is a double, but that this idea arose from a footnote error in an article by a French as- Stan Friedman tronomer. He also deals with other critics of the Hill star map, noting the lack of evidence for the criticisms. Friedman also discussed national security consider- ations in dealing with flying saucers, contending that \"flying saucers Violate our airspace without permission, all countries would like to be able to duplicate the in- credible flight characteristics of flying saucers, and the USA and probably several other countries not only have physical wreckage, but loads of sophisticated measurements.\" Dr. Eric Davis Dr. Eric Davis, who holds the Ph.D: in Astrophysics from the University of Arizona, and who is employed as aerospace/astrophysics researcher at the-National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), discussed \"Wormhole-Stargates: Tunneling Through the Cosmic Neighborhood.\" Davis describes the physical features of traversable wormhole-stargates, \"which were derived from classi- cal general relativity,\" and discusses how they can be created. \"Wormholes are.hyperspace tunnels through spacetime connecting together either remote regions .within our universe or two different universes; they even connect together different dimensions and differ- ent times. Space travelers would enter in one side of the tunnel and exit out the other, passing through the throat along the way.\"   , He adds, \"Effective travel time through the Cosmic Neighborhood via stargates would become irrelevant, but could be estimated to be thousands of times light speed.\" Davis explains that \"we don't know how to con- struct a traversable wormhole in the laboratory yet,\" and that while \"there are mathematical ideas address- ing this, there are no practical engineering solutions be- ing offered besides my own proposals.\" In looking at the characteristics of UFOs, he says, \"Wormhole-stargate characteristics can fulfill both Hill and Vallee's criteria for UFO phenomenon in both the physical and anti-physical sense,\" noting that several dozen UFO cases in the NIDS files \"clearly portend wormhole manifestations.\" He adds, \"Most of these features go beyond what is accepted by both the main-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 2001 Page 11 Dr. Robert Wood stream science and UFO communities as fitting within a rational framework.\" Dr. Robert Wood Dr. Robert Wood, MUFON Director of Research, discussed \"The Mounting Evidence for Authenticity of MJ-12 Documents.\" Picking up where he left off last year at the MUFON symposium in St. Louis, he says that it is likely that extraterrestrial life exists, that we are being visited by the extraterrestrials, that the gov- ernment knows about this, and that \"we would be expecting to have some documents surface, and we have some. The only question is whether they are genuine or whether they are fake.\" He notes that \"the process of authentication proof with so many different documents in- cludes a very wide range of considerations, such as physical dating of the ink, pencil and pa- per; dating by matching the reproductive process (type- writer or printer); dating by use of language of the pe- riod; identification of authorship using linguistics; com- parison of handwriting; comparison of known events of record; comparison with known styles of procedures of production; comparison with known or expected secu- rity procedures; logic of content; and records of prov- enance.\" In looking at this as it relates to the MJ-12 docu- ments, Wood says, \"Of particular significance are the results of research and forensic studies, including those on 22 pages on original paper, where chromatographic ink dating and other state of the art techniques clearly indicate that the documents were likely to have been created long ago and cannot be modern high tech fakes. The classic comparisons with archival authentic docu- ments show the expected similarities, and the content is shown to be consistent with numerous arcane facts know only to scholars in historiography.\" He dealt with critiques of some of the documents by Tom Deuley, Stanton Friedman, Kevin Randle, Don Berliner, Jan Aldrich, and Dick Hall, listing the specific responses to each. Wood concluded, \"Original documents can be dated back into the 50s, and no impressive reasons have come to light that would seriously impeach the authenticity of hundreds of pages of classified material, together with thousands of pages of supportive documentation.\" Daniel Sheehan Sheehan, an attorney involved with the Pentagon Pa- pers case, the Karen Silkwood case, and other high- profile cases, discussed \"Earning Our 'Citizenship' in Our Galactic Community: the New Paradigm.\" This new paradigm is needed, he says, where we explicitly acknowledge \"the now virtually scientifically-undeniable fact that other sentient and intelligent species other than our human species do, in fact, inhabit our Universe, in- deed, our very Galaxy.\" Sheehan, who has served as a legal advisor to Dr. Steven Greer in the current \"disclosure project\" headed by Greer, discussed in detail the elements which go into this new paradigm. He concluded, \"Those of us who are cognizant of the almost unthinkable advances that might be offered to us\" by an advanced extraterrestrial culture \"also hope that our human civilization will not respond to officially- confirmed contact with this civilization in a bellicose and potentially self-destructive show of force or hostility.\" Dr. Steven M. Greer Dr. Greer, who is leading a project to allow testimony by members of the military and others regarding UFOs, claimed that \"the evidence and testimony\" establishes the following: 1. \"That we are indeed being visited by advanced ex- traterrestrial civilizations, and have been for some time;\" 2. \"That this is the most classified, compartmented program within the U.S. and many other countries;\" 3. \"That those projects have, as warned in 1961 by President Eisenhower, escaped legal oversight and con- trol in the U.S., the UK, and elsewhere;\" 4. \"That advanced spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin...have been downed, retrieved, and studied since at least the 1940s, and possibly as early as the 1930s;\" 5. \"That significant technological breaktroughs in en- ergy generation and propulsion have resulted from the study of these objects-and from related human innova- tions dating as far back as the time of Nicola Tesla-and that these technologies utilize a new physics not requir- ing the burning of fossil fuels or ionizing radiating to generate vast amounts of energy;\" and 6. \"That classified, above top secret projects possess fully operational anti-gravity propulsion devices and new energy generation systems that, if declassified and put to peaceful uses, would empower a new human civiliza- tion without want, poverty, or environmental damage.\" Greer said he bases the above on \"the testimony of dozens of military, academic, and government wit- nesses,\" some foreign, more than 30 of which are briefly described-most identified only by initials-in his paper in the 2007 MUFON Symposium Proceedings. Dr. Barry Downing Dr. Downing, MUFON consultant in theology, author of The Bible and Flying Saucers, a member of the board of directors for the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), and recently retired pastor of the Northminster Presbyterian Church in Endwell, NY, dis- cussed \"UFOs and the Strange Business of Believing.\" Working from the assumption that \"UFOs are real and carry an intelligent reality from another world,\" he"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 September 2001 MUFON UFO Journal discussed the implications that this may have for West- ern culture. Downing, whose Ph.D. is in the field of both science and technology, discussed the differences between the \"godless scientific liberalism on the left and the Chris- tian Fundamentalism on the right in terms of the reli- gious implications of UFOs.\" He suggested that \"the ambiguity of UFOs-the un- certainty about UFO nature and purpose-makes UFOs a god-like force, and this ambiguity should make the God Hypothesis a more powerful concern for MUFON than the more limited concern of whatever the ad- vanced technology of UFOs may be.\" Bob Pratt Pratt, author of UFO Danger Zone: Terror and Death in Brazil-What Next?, as well as co-author of Night Seige: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings, has investigated UFO reports for more than 25 years as a pro- fessional journalist and freelance writer. While some researchers, experiencers, and commenta- tors contend that UFO occu- pants are here to help man- kind, Pratt recounts some of \"the dark side of the UFO phenomenon that some people may not be aware of.\" In his talk, \"UFO Terror in Brazil,\" he pointed out that \"people and animals can be in- jured in encounters, sometimes fatally. This has been especially true in Brazil, perhaps more so than in all other countries.\" In the late 1970's Pratt became aware of the Brazil- ian situation, and decided to personally investigate. In 13 visits to Brazil between 1978 and 1999 he spent a to- tal of nine months investigating UFO encounters in that country, some of which he has shared with readers of the MUFON UFO Journal. He reports several cases of traumatized victims, physical injuries, and death, with such unusual encoun- ters as hot oil being poured from a UFO on a woman, a victim being snagged with a hook and pulled into a UFO, and the burning of a tree by a UFO in order to get to a youth hiding beneath the tree. In terms of deaths, Pratt said, \"I know of at least nine deaths that occurred during or soon after encoutners. Four of these deaths were stillbirths. All the other deaths in- volved adults.\" In one case, however, the victim reported he was glad to have had the experience. Benedito Bogea was zapped by a beam of light from a V-shaped UFO, knocked unconscious, and awakened more than 60 miles away seven hours later. He felt so much pain in his right side that he thought he would die, and for two Bob Pratt months he could not stand on his right leg or hold any- thing in his right hand. However, he discovered that he no longer needed his glasses to see, and he could also hear loud noises for the first time in 13 years. Bogea reported that he would like to be zapped again to get his full hearing back. Pratt concludes, \"Over the past 50 years we have gathered a staggering amount of information about what people have seen and experienced, but-in my mind any- way-we know very little about UFOs. However, if I have learned one thing, it is that UFOs are unpredict- able. You never know what will happen in an encoun- ter.\" Budd Hopkins Hopkins, author of several books on abductions, devi- ated from his prepared talk on \"UFO Abductions and Their After-Effects\" (an interesting account which ap- pears in the 2001 MUFON Symposium Proceedings) to update the now-famous case involving Linda Cortile (pseudonym used at the request of Hopkins in defer- ence to Linda's family). She was reportedly floated in her nightgown from her twelfth-floor apartment near the Brooklyn Bridge into a hovering UFO at around 3 a.m. on Nov. 30, 1989. The UFO then flew over the Brooklyn Bridge and plunged into the East River, according to witnesses. The case is the subject of Hopkins' book Witnessed- The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abduc- tion (1996). In his update at the Symposium, Hopkins explained that material from two alleged government security agents and interviews with others involved have shown that some witnesses were \"switched off during at least part of the episode. One woman, for example, recalls the UFO and the car stopping, but did not see Linda. Another witness, a driver for The New York Post, remembers stopping on another bridge and seeing small figures entering the hovering UFO, but also did not see Linda. He also recalls seeing a group of limousines stopped, and has located three friends at the Post who also saw the stopped limos, backing up at least part of the accounts of two of the primary witnesses in this strange case. He was interviewed at home, the interview was vid- eotaped, and \"his account is genuine,\" says Hopkins. \"His memory has come back.\" This witness has also undergone hypnosis. Responding to critics who suggested that workers at The New York Post should have seen the abduction, Hopkins explained that the loading of newspapers at the Post takes place inside a closed area, and that workers could see the street, but not up in the air where the ab- duction occurred. He said he has not attempted to personally locate witnesses at The New York Post because Linda's hus- band works the night shift there, and he does not want to cause problems for the husband."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 2001 Pane 13 \"There were witnesses at five different locations that we know of,\" says Hopkins, \"and 24 people have been located so far that have had some part in this case.\" He noted that, according to material he has received, the two agents and \"the third man\" in one of the limou- sines (an important international leader that Hopkins will not identify, but who is apparently former Secretary- General of the United Nations Javier Perez de Cuellar) were also abducted that night. Dr. Roger K. Leir Dr. Leir, a podiatric surgeon and author of The Aliens and the Scalpel, discussed \"Alien Abduction- Alien Implants: Why????\" With nine implant surgeries completed-the first in 1995-Leir says that answers are hard to come by. \"It seems that no sooner do we have one explanation for our examinations than another ex- amination will reveal another unknown.\" Even so, Leir reports progress in learning about the characteristics of the im- plants. For example, he re- ports, \"The lack of inflam- matory response to these metal objects by the body s system of defenses is now believed to be caused by the membrane [of the objects]. The membrane has been analyzed, and is composed of a protein coagulum, he- mosiderin granules, and Dr. Roger Leir keratin. These substances are all normally present in the body, but there is no historical record in the medical literature to suggest that such a combination has ever been seen previously.\" The most recent implant surgery was performed Feb. 5, 2000, on Tim Cullen, who lives in eastern Colo- rado. Leir says that Cullen feels that the object was implanted in his left wrist when he and his wife report- edly experienced a close encounter in 1978. As to the \"why\" of implants, Leir theorizes that they involve the monitoring of genetic changes in humans, and that UFO entities may be continuing to manipulate humans genetically. He bases this theory in part on a study he did of the development of children which indi- cates that children now develop physically and mentally much faster than 40 years ago. Ryan S. Wood Wood discussed \"The First Roswell; Evidence for a Crash Retrieval in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, in 1941,\" presenting both primary and secondary sources and evi- dence. The primary witness in the investigation is Charlette Mann, granddaughter of Reverend William Huffman. Rev. Huffman offered blessings for three dead aliens after being called to the scene, according to testimony in 1984 from his wife on her deathbed. Other supporting witnesses were also discussed, as were several documents which Wood says support the witness testimony. This case continues to be actively investigated by Wood, and a full report of this case is scheduled for an upcoming MUFON UFO Journal. Ann Druffel Druffel, a veteran researcher and author of How to Defend yourself Against Alien Abductions, as well as co-author of The Tujunga Canyon Contacts, dis- cussed \"Alien Abduction Defense,\" describing the na- ture of the \"abductors,\" possible motives for abduction, physical and mental techniques which can be used to avoid abductions, the personality traits of successful re- sisters, and the problem faced by abductees who are unable to end the abductions. The resistance techniques described by Druffel in- clude mental struggle, physical struggle, rightous anger, protective rage, support from family members, appeal to spiritual personages, intuitive practices, metaphysical methods, and repellents. These techniques are based on more than 90 cases, and research continues. Dr. John E. Mack Dr. Mack, author and professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School, discussed \"Witnessing: Abductees as Sacred Truth-Tellers,\" reviewing his work over the past 12 years with individuals who have reported abductions. He noted, \"Although there was in some instances physical evidence that something had happened to my clients-unexplained marks on their bodies, UFOs seen in the vicinity, corroborating observation by others of at least a part of the encounters, and so forth-the evi- dence that I have is largely experiential-that is, the re- ports themselves.\" He noted that \"the heart of the problem\" is how to determine the truthfulness of these reports. \"It is the messiness of this question, I believe, that accounts, in part, for the tendency of science to avoid the study of the range of human experiences, like the UFO abduc- tion phenomenon, that tell us of realities that are per- haps far more vast, mysterious, and vital to our well be- ing than what can be known by empirical study of the physical world alone.\" Mack discusses some of the criteria in judging the truthfulness of testimony, and suggests that \"an authen- tic witness is by definition a teller of truth, a kind of sa- cred communicator.\" Jaime Maussan Maussan, a radio and TV personality in Mexico, pre- sented images of possible UFOs.

Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region Note: unless stated otherwise, the following are raw reports which have not been investigated by MUFON. Multiple New Jersey lights, triangle CARTERET — Peter Davenport, Chuck Warren, WABC, CNN, and New Jersey FM 101.5 have re- ported that a large UFO was sighted near the Newark Airport on July 15, 2001. Numerous large bright lights were reported in a flying triangle pattern moving above the New Jersey Turnpike around 12:30 AM on Sunday morning July 15,2001. Davenport received several reports from witnesses to a clus- ter of an estimated 15 to 30 golden or orange lights hovering and moving slowly near Newark. The witnesses were traveling south on the New Jersey Turnpike, and asserted that upwards of 100 cars were seen stopped on the high- way, and many of their occupants were standing outside the vehicles, apparently watching the peculiar V-forma- tion of lights. The Newark Star Ledger carried an ar- ticle about the alleged incident in its July 16 issue, and it reports that the police department in Carteret, NJ, lo- cated just southeast of Newark Airport, received doz- ens of calls about the incident. In addition, CNN TV-affiliate station WNY in New York City covered the sighing. Peter and Chuck con- tacted me and notified me that New Jersey FM 101.5 carried the story on the news, beginning each hour. Many callers to the station reported seeing a huge ob- ject. Some eyewitnesses claim to have seen a structure, others did not. Astronomers claimed there was no meteorite activ- ity. FAA claimed no aircraft were airborne in the area. Some of the witnesses were emotionally shaken by the event, although the nature of it is yet to be determined. The sighting of a flying triangle UFO was also shown on New York City TV station WNBC-TV and several other New York stations. The sighting was reported and videotaped by a Carteret Police Officer. The video was shown, and the police officer and several town resi- dents, including the mayor, were interviewed. The video was of excellent quality and showed a dark triangular-shaped object against a brighter night- time sky. The object had bright white lights on each cor- ner. It was moving too slowly to be identified as a me- teor, and NASA confirmed that it was not space debris. Its movements and lighting configuration were also not consistent with aircraft. David Stich, who was interviewed by the Newark Star Ledger, said that \"the bursts of light from those flares didn't look like spotlights or anything else I could recognize.\" I interviewed the Right Reverend Chubenko (who has higher rank than Monsignor in the Ukrainian Church) by phone, since he also saw the object. He sent me the following e-mail: \"I wanted to report this sighting, since it occurred at approximately 12:45 AM July 15, 2001, over the town of Carteret, New Jersey. I am an Orthodox Ukrainian priest-and my son (who is a funeral director who was going out on a death call) gets in touch with me via his cell phone at about 12:40 and tells me I need to get dressed quickly and come outside. \"He was just getting ready to get on to the New Jersey Turnpike when he saw a huge collection of lights numbering about 30 + over the town of Carteret, and, specifically over the \"Carteret Shoprite Shopping Center. \"I immediately put on a pair of shorts and slippers and went outside. By this time, my son was standing in front of the rectory (which is aside of the church) and was pointing to the series of lights moving in an easterly direction towards Staten Island. The Lights were ar- rayed in a series of triangular forms, but I only counted 13 or 14 lights. I say 13 or 14 because I was so taken by them that I didn't want to take my eyes off of them to count them twice. \"The entire group of lights was moving from right to left (east) and totally in unison. As they were moving, a light would 'drop' a l new' light from it (less intense than itself) and the 'new' light would fade away. Imme- diately after that, the light that just 'dropped' the new light would also fade out. \"This happened about five times as the collection of lights continued to move. As the entire sequence of lights continued to move behind the buildings to my im- mediate left, I had to move to our parking lot to see them, and as I did, I began to lose sight of the group of lights until there was only one light and then none at all! This was the strangest phenomenon I have ever seen. \"1 estimate that the lights were no more than 3000- 4000 feet above the town. I am a private pilot, so I have a little idea of height and some sense of distance in the sky. These lights made absolutely no noise and moved with such precision that they resembled a huge craft, yet I get the sense that they were individual lights and not one large craft. \"They definitely were not a meteor shower, nor were they stars moving. They were a 'calculated' se- ries of high intensity lights moving in a specific direc-"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 2001 Page 15 tion. At this point, I can only call them UFO's-and that they definitely were. I only wish I knew what they were doing here. If anyone else saw them or can ex- plain their purpose, I certainly would be interested in hearing about it.\" I had a long talk with Father Chubenko, who is an excellent witness and was also trained as an electrical engineer. He estimated the lights were 400 to 500 yards apart and connected to the same object, since they did not change their relative position and brightened and dimmed together. It looked like a huge triangle of lights. I asked if the lights might be flares dropped from air- craft. He felt this was impossible because the lights brightened and dimmed in a synchronized operation. It was obvious all the lights were connected to the same object. Thanks to Rt. Rev. Taras Chubenko, Pastor, St. Demetrius Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral 645 Roosevelt Ave. Carteret, NJ 07008. The sky was totally clear. No wind. Stars were vis- ible in the sky, as well as approaching aircraft to New- ark. There were no aircraft in the vicinity of the \"lights,\" and witnesses commented that the airplanes which were on approach to Newark airport were lower than usual. Multiple witnesses also claim they do not believe these were parachute flares, blimps, or other similar phenomena. A new witness claims to have observed the structure of a large flying triangle near Sayerville heading for Carteret. Witnesses further south along the New Jersey Turnpike saw aircraft on the normal approach to New- ark Airport apparently being diverted because of the presence of UFOs in the early morning hours of July 15. It is normal FAA procedure to divert aircraft away from potential danger without confirming the presence of UFOs to the aircrews. Unconfirmed reports indicate that radars in the New York area picked up a series of anomalous targets on the night of July 15 between 12:25 and 12:55 AM. These targets roughly match the ground witnesses' tes- timony of seeing lights over the New Jersey Turnpike. Carteret is only ten miles from New York City, the home of most major television networks. New York ra- dar operators indicate that dozens of anomalous targets were racing around the area. There are wide variations in speed, altitude and size. Anomalous largeis are those that are not using tran- sponders that arc required for all normal commercial traffic and identify the aircraft. The anomalous radar returns were flying too slow or too fast to be normal aircraft, and remain unidentified. MUFON investigator Bob Durant reports, \"In the short time the lights were displayed on screen, it was obvious that they were moving right to left at a slow but deliberate angular velocity. There was no relative movement among the lights. The top of a house or building, and possibly a chimney on a house, is visible beneath the lights and offer a reference for their move- ment. No stars were visible in the video scene. There were a total of ten lights, arranged in three groups. Be- ginning from the left on the screen, which corresponds with the foremost lights, we see five lights, then a space, then four lights, a much longer space, and a single light which brings up the rear of the moving set. \"There is no obvious symmetry to either the groups of five and four lights, or to the entire group of lights. The lights depicted in the video are large, steady and white, though there is some slight but perceivable varia- tion in diameter among them. One of the lights momen- tarily nearly 'goes out,' diminishing to a tiny point, then resuming its original size.\" Thanks to Bob Durant.

Ttuck-size object reported in Pennsylvania PHILADELPHIA — The witness reports, \"On Aug. 10, 2001, at 11:47 AM I was driving to work on Blue Route 476 and directly ahead of me, a half mile or so, I saw an object that resembled a cigar shape, quickly zooming over the highway. It flew over the trees and it disappeared. \"The craft looked as though it was about the size of a truck. It seemed to reflect the sky on the top, and more dark on the bottom half. It was not high at all. It looked like it was maybe a hundred feet over the high- way. If I were to hold out my arm and clench my fist, the object would be about half the size of my fist. \"No one else, as far as I could see, saw the object. This was not a plane, not a bird, not a helicopter. The object kind of teetered back and forth as it passed, al- most out of control. \"Last year, another UFO flew by within a hundred feet from the ground.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport at the National Reporting Center www.ufocenter.com UFOs and fighter jets in Florida ST. PETERSBURG — ISUR reports that at about 11:30 PM on Aug. 10, 2001, the witness, his son, and a friend observed a bright white colored light/object hov- ering in the sky over St. Petersburg. The object moved, then reversed n's direction 180 degrees, turned at sharp angles, and zig-^.iggcd in an incredible manner. At times the object would stop, then move forward in short pulse-like bursts of speed, then hover for long pe- riods. After about 15 minutes, several jet fighter type aircraft appeared, believed by the witness to be from nearby McDill AFB, which is about 5 miles east. The witness stated that these jet aircraft appeared to travel a course to the southeast as if trying to locate something, because they repeated this two more times, but at a higher altitude. The light/object remained sta- tionary while the jets flew this pattern. Eventually, it be- gin to \"drift\" and then smaller lights/objects appeared from all directions, they too drifting, but toward the pri- mary object, then all finally became motionless.

Smooth triangle reported in Ohio BLANCHESTER — \"On July 31, 2001, at 11:50 PM,\" the witness relates, \"I was driving southeast on Route 123, when I saw a flying triangular-shaped ob- ject. The tips were very smooth and round. There was a white light in each corner and a bright red light in the middle. \"It hovered there for about 30 seconds. As I came closer it shot over to the north and came to a complete dead stop. It didn't start slow or slow down to stop. It stopped as fast as it went. It just sat there in the sky perfectly still. It stayed there for about 1 1/2 minutes. 1 then turned onto my street and could not see it for a minute because of trees. \"Then I saw it hovering over a house. It took me two minutes to reach my driveway. I couldn't see it any- more until it shot across the sky tremendously fast- faster than any aircraft and completely silent. It shot over my house, flew two houses north of mine, and hovered in my neighbor's field. It wasn't very far from their house. It just sat there hovering with no movement or sound, like it was watching me. \"I sat in my car for two minutes and watched. I was stunned, but ran into my house to get my video camera, but I had forgotten lo recharge the battery. When I ran back outside it was still there. \"We looked at each other for about 50-60 seconds and it was gone. It never changed altitude or shape. It was larger than a full moon.\" Peter Davenport felt this was an excellent and credible witness. UFO reported near Chicago airport traffic DOWNERS GROVE — A glowing, gold/orange cylinder-shaped object was observed Aug. 1, 2001, fly- ing northeast toward Chicago at 8:15 PM. The area of observation is near O'Hare and Midway airports, and several jet aircraft were in the area flying in normal traffic patterns. The witness says, \"We noticed the object was flying nearly at the same altitude of the jet aircraft, but much faster. The object all at once slowed down as a B-757 aircraft departed Midway airport, westbound, and flew past our position. We were amazed at this behavior, as if the object was observing the jet. \"The object then accelerated to the northeast and disappeared in a wink as a B-727 came into view from the east. The 727 entered the O'Hare inbound traffic pattern, flying downrange and turning 180 degrees to begin a final approach. It seemed that object was right on top of the 727 and then just vanished. \"Based upon my 25 years in the airline industry, I have never seen such a strange object or vehicle in this area. I am quite certain the object was not a military or commercial aircraft, based upon the following: \"1) Aircraft operating in the area were distinguished by familiar physical characteristics, dark in appearance with wings, landing lights and anti-collision lights easily seen and flying in a pattern. \"2) The object was a glowing, gold/orange cylinder with NO wings and NO tail section; it changed speeds, and immediately vanished. I have witnessed UFO's hovering near the ground, and flying at altitude in the western US. I have never seen an object or UFO enter controlled airspace until this incident, and frankly, the episode was chilling. I am very concerned about the possibility of these vehicles colliding with commercial aircraft.\" Peter Davenport spoke at length with this witness, and found him to be quite credible.

Available from Amazon.com, $25.00 hard cover; $ 16.00 soft cover. Reviewed by Barry Downing Terry Hansen's well researched book is in the same class as Richard Dolan's UFOs and the National Se- curity State (reviewed by John Schuessler in the Janu- ary 2001 issue of the Journal), and the well-known book by Victor Marchetti and John Marks, The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Hansen is described as \"an inde- pendent journalist with an interest in scientific controversies and the politics of mass media\" who \"has followed the UFO controversy for decades and has written about it for various media.\" Hansen's thesis is very simple: it is not just that the United States government has hidden UFO information from the pub- lic, but that the American media, print and TV, have co- operated in covering up UFO information. By and large they have done this for what they see as the national security interest, and Hansen demonstrates that since World War H-since the beginning of the atomic age- the American media have felt it their duty to cooperate with our government in these matters. Since we Americans are brought up believing \"free- dom of the press\" is guaranteed by the Constitution, we therefore assume-falsely-that if our government is ly- ing about something, the press will expose the lie. In my discussions about UFOs, I have often heard it said, \"I can believe our government would lie about UFOs, but I cannot believe The New York Times or The Washing- ton Post would not expose the lie by this time.\" Read Hansen's book, and believe it! Obviously, the editors of The New York Times, The Washington Post, or Time Magazine have not said to Hansen, \"Yes, we have helped keep the UFO lie go- ing.\" Hansen has to build his case on circumstantial evi- dence, but it is good evidence. Hansen begins his book with a discussion of a series of sightings in the Great Falls, MT, area in 1975, during which UFOs were reported to hover over the Minute- man Intercontinental Ballistic Missile silos, with dozens of people involved in the sightings, civilian and military. Hansen points out that these sightings were reported lo- cally in the newspaper, and on radio. But these sightings, says Hansen, \"went unreported by the national news media. As a journalist with an in- terest in media sociology, these UFO sightings and the way information about them ultimately surfacing in the national news media provide a uniquely illuminating case study of government/media interaction.\" (p. 19) Hansen believes that because our government sees UFOs as a national security issue, the national media have cooperated in downplaying legitimate UFO cover- age. This has probably been done because agents of our government-the CIA and other agencies-are placed in key media centers to make sure that UFOs are not taken seriously at the national level. Hansen points out that it was The National Enquirer that finally broke the Great Falls story two years after the event, saying, \"The appearance of the story in such a publication would likely have had the ef- fect of discrediting the events altogether.\" (p. 34) One of Hansen's arguments is that the CIA may have been involved using The National Enquirer to help discredit UFOs by having this magazine distribute true UFO stories under the direction of Gene Pope, who had formerly been with the CIA before going with the Enquirer. During this time reporter Bob Pratt was given a liberal expense allowance to investigate UFOs, and Hansen records a long interview with Pratt in his book. Pratt was a speaker at the 2001 MUFON Sympo- sium in California, and I had breakfast with him and Walter Andrus during the conference. I discussed Hansen's book with Pratt, who told Andrus and me that Hansen had contacted him several times. In regard to whether Pope was involved with the CIA, Pratt said that Hansen's charge could be true, but if so he had no knowledge of it. He noted that \"Gene Pope was an unusual publisher who not only read and approved every word, line, story, photo, headline, and so forth, but he was also willing to spend gobs of money to do what had to be done.\" Pratt added, \"I don't think I was used, but I couldn't swear to it. No one dictated what UFO stories I did, but some story ideas got killed, mainly because they didn't appeal to a particular editor I was working for at the time.\" As for Hansen's book, Pratt says, \"I think it is a good book, and an important one.\" The middle chapters of the book, \"A Brief History of Lies\" and \"Perception Management\" have more to do with how the government controls information in gen- eral, and how the media react to this control, than to UFO information specifically. This section of the book is necessary to establish the patterns of relationships between our government and the media. Hansen devotes a detailed section to Dr. John Mack's involvement with Dateline. Mack's story was that a reporter became very interested in his work, filmed \"experiencers,\" and put together a positive pro-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 September 2001 MUFON UFO Journal gram, which was then in effect killed by management. The reporter then resigned, but asked Mack not to come to his support, lest he \"be blackballed from getting other jobs.\" (p. 262) MUFON comes in. for brief mention in the book. A memo by Charles Swett, a Pentagon policy analyst, mentions MUFON's work in attempting to expose De- partment of Defense work in relation to UFOs. (p. 289) Hansen ends his book with \"Ethical Considerations.\" He states that his point of view is that the media should make the truth about UFOs known to the public. \"I must admit, however, that this may not be the case. It is pos- sible that the nature of the UFO threat is such that the elite news media have been fully justified in helping the U.S. government deceive the American public.\" (P. 294) In discussing my UFO work with one of the editors of my local paper, the editor said to me, without expla- nation, \"I think what you are doing is very dangerous.\" So far as I know, MUFON has never had a clear discussion of the ethics of the exposure of UFO infor- mation in relation to national security needs. By and large we have been supportive of efforts by those like Steven Greer in his \"Disclosure Project,\" or in the past the Freedom of Information efforts of Barry Green- wood, Stanton Friedman, Missouri MUFON, Larry Bryant, and others to gain UFO information from the government. Since MUFON sees itself as a scientific organiza- tion, in which truth is truth, and we should have a right to it, the whole question of the relation between scien- tific truth, the media, and national security kind of hangs out on a limb, and we do not know what to do with it. Hansen's book reminds us how far out we are on this limb. Missouri program set for Nov. 3 Missouri MUFON, under the guidance of State Di- rector Bruce Widaman, will present \"Flying Saucers Hidden History 2001\" on Nov. 3 at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. The program in the J. C. Penney Auditorium will get underway at 9 a.m. and conclude at 9 p.m. The theme of the all-day program is disclo- sure of the government cover-up of UFO information. Speakers include Stanton Friedman, author of Crash at Corona and Top Secret/Majic, Richard Dolan, au- thor of UFOs and the National Security State (re- viewed in January, 2001, Journal); and Dr. Carol Rosin. \"A fourth speaker may be added later,\" says Widaman, who notes that a panel discussion involving all the speakers will conclude the day's activities. He adds, \"I expect some very interesting revelations.\" The fee for the all-day program is $50.00 if reserved by Oct. 20, or $60.00 after that date. Individual sessions will also be available.

Bovine hemoglobin reported at another animal mutilation site William Levengood, who is best known for his re- search on crop circles, reports a second finding of hard- ened bovine hemoglobin involving a mutilated animal, this one in a cow mutilation case in Alabama on Feb 21, 2001. Previously Levengood had reported hardened bovine hemoglobin discovered on a mutilated bull in California last year. In the recent Alabama case the udder was removed, and tissue was excised from the rectum, vagina, right eye, and lips. The purity of the hemoglobin in the latest case was confirmed by an infared spectral analysis conducted by analytical chemist Phillis Budinger at the Frontier Analysis, Ltd. Laboratory in Chagrin Falls, OH. She reports: \"The presence of hemoglobin would in- dicate a processing of the whole blood has occurred. The usual procedure for isolating hemoglobin from the whole blood is rather complex. It involves separating red blood corpusles from the lighter plasma components by centrifugation. It is unlikely that a procedure such as this would be done on site.\" Levengood notes that the animal's owner said that broken limbs above the young cow-and tree debris on top of it-indicted the animal had been dropped from a considerable height. Levengood says that pure hemo- globin is not found in nature, and that a special labora- tory is needed to break down the walls of the red blood cells and separate the hemoglobin from other parts of the blood. Putting it into solid form involves another process. All of this takes considerable time, he notes. In an Oct. 16, 1998, case involving the mutilation of a three-year-old Polled Hereford cow, investigators for the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) found, among other things, \"an unusual, formaldehyde- containing blue gel-like substance on the eye, the ear, and the anus of the animal.\" The heart was shredded, but the membranous sac enclosing the heart was intact. Severe hemorrhaging under the hide around the neck was found. However, no hardened bovine hemoglobin was reported in that case. Levengood says it is not surprising that hemoglobin is rarely found, since it is so difficult to extract. He does not believe that the hemoglobin is a by-product, but, rather, the main element being sought. Levengood has reported similarities between animal mutilation sites and crop circle sites, such as microme- teorite-sized pure iron oxide particles distributed in a precise manner, as well as indications of injury to veg- etation due to heat-possibly the result of something similar to microwave radiation."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 2001 Page 19 A link between crop circles, UFOs, mutilations? Dear Dwight, Thanks for your excellent article \"Nancy Talbott tak- ing BLT to new level\" (MUFON UFO Journal, July 2001). 1 am delighted that Nancy is finally getting the recognition she deserves as spokesperson for BLT and coordinator of the massive fieldsampling efforts of the BLT Research team over nearly the last decade. Buried in the BLT Research article is the fleeting mention that, in addition to examining plants and soil from crop circles, BLT is also involved in sampling \"un- usual animal death\" sites (cattle mutilations). I realize that Nancy Talbott modestly touched on the connections BLT is finding among crop circles, mutila- tions and UFO trace cases in her September, 1998, ar- ticle for the Journal. The fact that we now have scientific data linking three of the greatest mysteries of our times is poten- tially the most significant and profound breakthrough in the history of ufology. It would seem to deserve the greatest emphasis possible in a journal devoted to scien- tific ufology. I have hammered this point home relent- lessly in my article \"High Heat\" (Spirit Magazine Vol. 11, #19 1998) and elsewhere, but thus far it has been largely ignored by the UFO research community. I would hope that BLT's preliminary findings will bring clarification to the current debate over what is properly in the purview of ufology. In my 25 years of research, I've determined that there is no discipline or field of inquiry that is unrelated to ufology. I've also watched with some chagrin as many of the big guns of ufology (individuals and groups) have swept the trouble- some and distasteful cattle mutilation phenomenon un- der the rug, claiming that it muddied the waters of \"pure .ufology.\" Hopefully the BLT Research findings will bring about a moratorium on mutilation research bashing while sci- entifically inclined ufologists take a long hard look at the data BLT is generating. In your article on BLT, you mention that Nancy Talbott is currently investigating a case in Holland in- volving a young man who claims to have witnessed the formation of several crop circles. Robbert, now aged 21, has apparently also been able to predict when and where circles would happen. According to Nancy, sampling of these formations by BLT bio-physicist, W.C. Levengood, has shown the same physiological changes to plants as found else- where in \"classic\" circles and mutilation sites. The tests still being conducted by Levengood have also revealed, in at least one of the Dutch formations so far, the pres- ence of the small magnetic particles found in many other circles and \"bovine excision sites.\" According to Nancy, Robbert has a history of being the \"focus\" of intense poltergeist-type activity. Al- though BLT has steadfastly maintained their focus on building a large data base and has admirably refrained from speculation in these matters, to my mind at least, Robbert's \"connection\" to the crop circles presents some tantalizing possibilities. It seems plausible that Robbert has some role in fa- cilitating/kindling/triggering/generating the crop circles he has witnessed. In one instance, Robbert saw a bright light at night, lost consciousness and then awoke in \"a brand new crackling circle\" complete with the smell of sulphur in the air. Nancy Talbott feels that Robbert is somehow \"tap- ping into an energy highway,\" and admits that he may have a role in creating the circles, but is convinced that it is not a conscious role, It is not a giant leap in logic to then postulate that an individual or individuals, through unexplained uncon- scious processes are responsible for \"creating\" the aforementioned scientifically linked phenomena. I realize that this conjecture will cause much teeth gnashing and wailing among the \"nuts and bolts\" contin- gent of ufology. Sorry about that, but we must go where the evidence leads us, even if it does fly in the face of our personal needs and expectations. It would be appropriate for ufological truthseekers to examine the \"reality creating\" aspects of consciousness described by quantum physics. As physicist John Wheeler states: \"We live in a participatory universe.\" Nancy Talbott told me in a recent conversation: \"We feel that we've identified at least some of the compo- nents of the complex energy systems at work in these events. Whether these energy systems are spontaneous or generated is the real question.\" If they are spontane- ous, are we looking at an unrecognized force of nature? If they are generated, then by whom or what and for what purpose? In my study of evolutionary psychology, I've tenta- tively concluded that anomalies and unexplained phe- nomena must have some importance in the trajectory of our cultural and/or biological evolution. What roles these strange and beautiful phenomena might play is the un- discovered country. -David Perkins, Santa Fe, New Mexico When secrets crash A very interesting article, which the Journal readers should take careful note of, appeared in the July issue of Air Force Magazine.

The censored documents I received via FOIA in 1988 do not disclose the aircraft type or designation, although some details indicate conventional technology.

The witness checked the source of the sound and saw in a clear sky a matte black triangle-shaped object flying from the south straight toward him at a speed es- timated to be \"40 miles per hour or less.\" It was \"at a very low altitude,\" and \"made a sharp 90-degree turn,\" proceeding west and descending over a tree line 75 feet away until the witness lost sight of it. Dybala, who has 20/20 vision and good hearing, esti- mated that the object came within 120 feet of him', and was about the size of a baseball at arm's length. He said it appeared to be solid. He estimated its size as 100 feet on each side, and said the object had red lights at each of the three cor- ners, each with the shape of \"a gas ball,\" and a white light in the center of the underside. He said the object cast a light. \"I was attentive,\" he emphasizes, \"looking for detail to rule out common aircraft.\" The area of the sighting is a mixture of fields, woods, and suburban development, and is two miles east of Argonne National Laboratories. Leone notes that \"we've had other sightings in this area years on end, and this is also not very far from New Lenox, where we also had sightings take place years ago.\""},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 2001 Page 21 View from Britain Jenny Randies Air of mystery One of the topics being hotly debated in the UK right now concerns mid-air encounters between UFOs and commercial aircraft. There has been increasing alarm at the rising numbers of such events during the past de- cade-with dozens on public record in the UK-and.the fear is growing that they may lead to a disaster. This is a topic that I have been concerned with for quite some time-and I have personal cause to know just how dan- gerous that scenario can be. Partly as a consequence I have compiled a study of mid- air encounters in book form that was published in the UK as Something in the Air (Hale) and in the US under the rather less subtle title UFO Danger in the Air!' (Sterling, 1998). The figures: Almost 100 mid-air encounters have been reported since 1990 over Britain alone. These figures are likely to be an under estimate, given evidence from a study by Scottish UFOlogist Jim Sneddon, who routinely re- corded air-to-ground radio communications and found a steady stream of never-reported UFO encounters., So the official figures are the tip of the iceberg. This concern is seen in true context when one con- siders that the skies over the UK are not as densely trafficked as the US (there is only a modest level of in- ternal flights given the relatively short distances in- volved and the extensive rail network that carries most long range passengers across the nation). A particularly serious incident occurred in April 1991 when an Alitalia flight heading into London Heathrow over Kent encountered a fast moving lozenge shape that was also tracked on radar. For a time there was a fear that this was an accidental missile launch from a coastal base, but this was effectively eliminated and, according to the records I saw whilst writing Some- thing in the Air, the case was accepted by the CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) as a genuine UFO encounter. Not that they knew what one of those was! Possibly the most famous event (in the UK at least) happened within 5 miles of where I live in the Peak District of Derbyshire. A British Airways Boeing 737 heading into Manchester on a flight from Milan in early January 1995 came close to a rocket-shaped mass which crossed its path as it flew above the settlement of Whaley Bridge. \" Although this case is often featured on TV programs discussing UFOs I personally am reasonably certain that it was an encounter with a bolide-a bright meteor that trailed gasses, but not seen from the ground owing to cloud cover. The CAA investigation found that only the Boeing was on radar, and I think the crew's impres- sion that this thing passed close by them was subjective and it was in fact much higher and farther away. Indeed there are marked similarities between this case and the famous Chiles-Whitted episode over Ala- bama in 1948.1 personally believe that this incident was a bolide, too, based on cases that I have followed up where a trail of debris crossing the atmosphere has been perceived by witnesses as being lights or windows on the side of a rocket or cigar-shaped craft. But I do realise that theory is a contentious argu- ment! I refer you to Something in the Air for a closer argument as to why I think this appropriate, but you are free to consider both cases more strange. The British Airways crew do not agree with my conclusions, I should add. A real threat: However, in some respects it actually does not mat- ter if the 1995 sighting is explicable. I think other mid-air encounters probably have explanations too, such as an episode on the approach to Gatwick in Sussex when a small silvery ball crossed the path of a descending jet. In that case I believe the UFO was a toy balloon. Whilst that might seem almost absurd (maybe even more absurd than a bolide in the above case), I have first hand experience of the possibility. In May, 1969,1 witnessed from the ground a small sil- very ball pace an aircraft heading over Manchester. It circled the tail fin and then pulled away as the plane banked. I was lucky enough to have a telescope handy and watched the incident through this, seeing that the ball was, in my view, almost certainly a small balloon. This had probably escaped from a fair then ongoing in a nearby park and must have got caught in the slip- stream of the plane. After being tugged along it \"broke free,\" but only when the aircraft changed direction. Having seen this happen all those years ago I have investigated the possibility of balloon slipstream cap- tures involving ascending and descending jets, and by all accounts this does seem to be a probable cause of a number of mid-air encounters (although, of course, hardly all, or even most, of them). I think it is worth bearing in mind that 90-95% of all UFO sightings do have a resolution as some form of IFO. And it would be unwise to imagine that a fair ratio of mid-air sightings are not going to be explained away as well. Air crew are, of course, experienced observors and when they have instrumental back-up"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Page 22 September 2001 MUFON UFO Journal (such as radar trackings) the sighting can be very inter- esting arid difficult to crack. But pilots are also human beings and just as likely to misperceive things as any human can be. Indeed at speed in mid air any sighting can be quite fleeting, making estimates of speed, height, and size almost impossible to make accurately (espe- cially at night). Whilst I am often accused of demeaning the capabili- ties of a trained and skilled observer by saying such things, that is not the case. I am full of admiration for the skills of these mid-air witnesses. But as an experi- enced investigator of UFO sightings-like many of you-I am also aware of how often anomalous stimuli can and do fool the senses. Sometimes it does not matter if you are Albert the dockyard worker or Albert Einstein; humans see ordi- nary things in extraordinary ways; It is how our senses and our brains, operate. It is the fundamental principle behind many UFO sightings. .  - However, even if a sighting is explainable, as I think many of these mid-air encounters probably are (other causes involving met balloons and military test equip- ment, for example), this is not to minimise the conse- quences. Indeed quite the reverse.      • I think we need to be better informed about the things that are visible up there, because they are a po- tential threat. The more that air crew can become aware of what they might encounter and how they might perceive it the safer air travel will be. I am very respectful of the work that ; Richard Haines is doing in this regard, for example.  , . It is extremely foolish to dismiss as irrelevant a sighting of what might be just a toy balloon on the grounds that it clearly is no risk to a huge jetliner Physi- cally it may not be. Neither would a bolide burning up many miles above the aircraft. But if the air crew per- ceive these things (as they often.do) in far more intimi- dating fashion, then the threat is very real indeed. Therisk: Of course, thankfully, pilots are highly trained to ex- pect the unexpected, but they are bound to react in- stinctively when they see something heading at them that they believe might be a UFO. Who wouldn't? If unaware of the possibilities they could put the aircraft into a dive and lead to stresses on the superstructure. It may even be necessary to do this in the prevailing cir- cumstances, but I am arguing that the more informed about UFOs (and most especially about IFOs) that air crew can be the better it will be for all of us. So I certainly do not believe that the solving of mid- air cases is a trivial matter. Yet even if many mid-air sightings are explicable, that word many is not the same as all. There are cases that will be genuine encounters between an aircraft and a real UFO. Since both are fly- ing objects, and thus within their own environment, the percentage of unsolved mid-air cases is likely to be above the norm. So this article is emphatically not an argument that . all mid-air encounters are misperceptions. And it is equally important that air crew are familiarised with the relatively remote, but nonethe- , less real, possibility that an actual UFO might cross their path one day. The more we can study these things, the more IFOs we can eliminate. And the more we can know about the unsolved phenomena that might be up there, .the bet- ter we can inform those who take the great responsibil- ity of flying us around the planet. For often it will be our responsibility to bring forward this information. We cannot rely on the (largely poorly informed) powers that be to do it for us. And we need to make our case with objectivity and humility, rather than to insist that every mid-air encounter is a deadly brush with an alien scoutship, in order that our words might be listened to by those who quite rightly will re- spond to common sense rather than hysteria. So what happened to me you might ask? Here is the story. It occurred, by the way, in the same general area (the Pennine Hills) and in the very same month (Janu- ary 1995) as the British Airways episode described above. On Jan. 28 I was flying home from a live TV show in Ireland. The weather was deteriorating, with driving icy rain and gale-force winds. Thankfully the little plane touched down safely (al- though very bumpily) at just after 6.30 p.m., and those of us on board burst into spontaneous applause at the skill of the crew given the terrible conditions. I doubt any of us were looking out of the window as we came in. A few days later a UFO sighting was routed through to me by the radio telescope and science centre at Jodrell Bank. Mrs. Graham from Bradford had been out walking her dog on the evening of my flight when she noticed a small plane heading into Leeds/Bradford fight- ing against the winds. From the time she recalled, this flight had to be ours (few other planes landed anywhere near this same time and none were small ones). As Mrs Graham watched, she saw a ball of white light head towards it from the side and feared a colli- sion. But this ball seemed to then hug the side of the aircraft and \"escort\" it just a few feet away. She esti- mates the ball was only a foot or two in diameter. As the aircraft descended into the airport to land, the ball of light pulled away at a sharp angle and streaked away into the sky. It is hard to know what to make of this stunning ac- count. But Mrs Graham had no way to know that I had been on that plane. Her story was clearly sincere, and I do not know whether to regard this eerie tale as one big coincidence, to think that \"someone up there\" was guid- ing me home, or to ponder if this suggests that mid-air encounters are now so commonplace that it was no big deal that I got involved in one. If so, then we might not be aware of anything like the full extent of the problem."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal September 2001 Page 23 October 2001 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars (-0.1 magnitude), in Sagittarius, lies low in the SSW at dusk, setting in the WSW about 11 PM in mid- October.

Late in October the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter ar- rives at Mars and begins to circle the planet.

The two heavenly symbols of both seasons-the Sum- mer Triangle and the Great Square of Pegasus-lie on either side of the meridian. Meteor Shower: The Orionid meteors peak in a moonless sky on the morning of October 22. These swift meteors appear to emanate from Orion's upraised club in the southern sky. Even though shower members are mostly faint and number only about 20 to 25 per hour at maximum, occa- sional bright fireballs appear, a third of them leaving wakes called trains that persist for 1 or 2 seconds.

(Continued from Page 24) products or MUFON UFO Journal subscriptions. Ap- parently, some of the money orders do not reflect U.S. dollars and the banks must pay a penalty for redeeming them. International money orders in U.S. dollars and checks against a U.S. bank in U.S. dollars are still ac- cepted. The bank code on the bottom of the check or money order must contain nine (9) digits to be accept- able. This is an aggravating situation for everyone in- volved. Postage Rate Increases For the past several years the U.S. Postal Service has continued to escalate the cost of mailing all classes of mail. Even so, MUFON has held the line on price increases and has not passed the increasing postage cost or the printing and production cost increases on our members. We can no longer continue operating in that manner. The MUFON Board of Directors, acting on this is- sue at the annual Board meeting in July, approved in- creases in the listed postage and handling costs for MUFON products, and an increase in the MUFON UFO Journal annual subscription cost. Accordingly, the MUFON product price list has been revised to cover the increased mailing costs. Recogniz- ing this will be a hardship on some of our members, we have drastically reduced the price of approximately 60% of the MUFON documents on the price list. We will maintain this price cut for at least six months as a benefit to members. The new prices lists are available via hard copy and on the MUFON web site at www.mufon.com. The increase in the subscription price for the MUFON UFO Journal will be delayed until 1 January 2002 to allow members to renew at the current price ($30 USA and $35 foreign). Early renewal may be done in one, two, or three year increments."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 September 2001 MUFON UFO Journal By John Schuessler MUFON International Director New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director for Field Investigator Training, has announced the following Field Investigator Trainees have completed the Field Investigator's Exam and are now MUFON Field Investigators: Chris Bellio, Melrose, MA; David Stevens, Fairfield, CA; and James Allen Tutt, Jr., Kansas City, MO.

Successful Symposium The MUFON 2001 UFO Symposium, held in July in Irvine, California, was one of the most success- ful MUFON events in several years. Credit for this success goes to Symposium Chairman Jan Harzan and the entire Orange County MUFON team. Their event planning activities, attention to detail, and hard work contributed to the success of the event. Thank you Or- ange County and thank you attendees-you all made it happen. MUFON 2002 UFO Symposium The MUFON 2002 UFO Symposium will be held at the Hyatt Regency Rochester, in Rochester, New York, hosted by New York MUFON. State Di- rector Jim Bouck and his team have begun the speaker selection planning work. We will have more to report on this in the near future. Another Special Grant Supports Outreach Project In the July issue of the MUFON UFO Journal we announced a three-part outreach project to send a Journal subscription to all U.S. Senators, all U.S. Rep- resentatives, and all major news outlets. The first step of this project was accomplished in July through a dona- tion from Zoh Meyerhoff Hieronimus and Dr. Bob Hieronimus. All U.S. Senators are now receiving the Journal. We are pleased to announce that we will be sending the MUFON UFO Journal to all major news outlets, starting with the September issue, because we have re- ceived further support from Zoh Meyerhoff Hieronimus and Dr. Bob Hieronimus. Dr. Bob hosts the \"21st Century Radio\" show and Zoh hosts \"Future Talk.\" I have appeared a number of times on their programs to freely talk about the work MUFON is doing and how people can get involved with MUFON. Their support for our projects is outstanding and dearly appreciated. Matching Funds are Needed Now that two parts of the MUFON Outreach Project are underway, we need to complete the very important third part-sending the MUFON UFO Jour- nal to all U.S. Congressional Representatives. We are now reaching important people outside of MUFON with the results of our work. As we go to press, we have had an offer for half of the funds needed to complete the third part of the project if we can raise matching funds for the other half. Due to the large number of representatives, this is the most costly, but perhaps the most important, phase of the project. MUFON members, officers, consultants, and board members are urged to seek major donors for this and other MUFON research projects. I am available to speak with potential donors at (303) 932-7709 or via e- mail at schuessler@mho.net. Canadian Postal Money Order Problem Our U.S. banks have stopped accepting Cana- dian Postal Money Orders in payment for MUFON (Continued on Page 23)"}]
