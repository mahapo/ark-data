It has long been a covert concern to all technically advanced governments. A new public aware- ness to the mystery has placed new pressures on private UFO research groups to intensify their efforts to probe the mystery, and find the answer. With the proliferation of UFO activity since 1973, showing an in- crease in reported UFO landings and close encounter incidents, new distinguished names representing all fields of science have openly joined in research. Now there is a scientific urgency to identify the UFO's nature and origin. And find- ing those answers scientifically is the prime purpose of MUFON/GSW. Theories as to the answer of th^ UFO's nature and origin are many and are amply known to MUFON/ GSW. At this juncture in its continu- ing search for evidential proof, MUFON/GSW recognizes two major hypothetical realms which may provide a plausible or even a cate- gorical answer: 1. That UFO's are surveil- lance vehicles (occupied and/ or propelled) controled by an advanced extraterrestrial in- telligence. 2. Tha UFO's constitute an extra-dimensional or psychical manifestation associated with planet Earth that is not under- stood by present day science, or possibly; 3. An interaction of both elements. Irrespective to theory, MUFON/ GSW is dedicated foremost to serve a twofold operation in its research: 1. Basically to study all UFO reports, endeavoring to find a meaningful pattern from cor- related and computerized raw UFO data, and by employing scientific methodology, to achieve an understandable determination of the UFO's nature and origin. 2. To objectively disseminate the resultant and substantive facts of this study to the news media and the public. Perhaps the most popular and plausible theory is that which char- acterizes the UFO as an intelligently controlled vehicle of extraterrestrial origin. However; many technical questions remain to be answered before a commitment can be an- nounced to the world qualifying the UFO as interplanetary. MUFON/GSW is aware of the risks of making a premature judgement at this juncture, knowing that the constant imput of new UFO data, or any single dramatic incident, may trigger a breakthrough to substan- tiate any one theory or show proof that two theories can be unified. For the present, MUFON/GSW will continue its critical examination of all the banked data which is broken down into four major categories, as follows: 1. To determine the nature of the UFO, its structure, aero- dynamic principles and anomalous behavior, (maneu- verability, speed, nullification of gravity, etc.) method of propulsion, the physical trace evidence and residuals re- sulting from landings and close encounters, and com- puterization to determine the authenticity of photographs allegedly showing UFOs. 2. To determine the origin of ; the UFO, conceivably from our \" solar system or another distant star system in our galaxy, or from an extra - dimensional realm in space and time not yet determined\" by our laws of science. 3. To determine the nature of the UFO humanoid occupants, their degree of intelligence, behaviorism, physicognomy, and their functional or tactical assignment. 4. To determine the means of communication used by the intelligence inherent with the UFO. Other than radio astronomy in search for signals from outer space, research depends on the UFO and/or humanoid contact for communicative evidence. The strongest evidence in support of the UFO's existence, essential before hypotheses can be explored, is in MUFON's and GSW's updated statistical and photographic data to be released during the MUFON symposium. Significant is the computerization of 80,000 individual UFO entries, including those from the Air Force's Project Bluebook files, many of which bear physical trace evidence as a result of UFO landings and close encounter incidents. Most of these cases have been investiaged on-the- (contlnued on page 16) 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"UFOs Seen Near Barcelonnette, France By Mr. Jean Bastide On the evening of Wednesday, December 8, 1976, two staff-ser- geants of the llth Battalion of Alpine Light Infantry (\"Bataillon de Chas- seurs Alpins\"), Mr. Gaborris and Mr. Charrins, are driving between Meyronnes and Maisonmeane, going to Maisonmeane, where they have their quarters, coming from Meyron- nes. About 23 hours, they can seen, under the cloud level (ther are clouds in the night sky, lightened by the full moon which was rising at 18 h 50 and is visible on the South-East) a very strange object, of a long oval or elliptic-shape flying from S.-E. (Italy to N.-E. The dark object is only visible several seconds, disappearing in the direction of Mirandol Pass (Col de Mirandol), whose altitude is of 2433 meters (about 8000 feet) a little under the level of the cloud ceiling, which is about 2500-3000m (8200-9800 feet). Arrived a little after 23hOO at their quarters of Maison- meane, they are informed about the fact that the dogs of the mountain section have just been howling at the same hour, when the object was flying in the night sky. We must not forget the fact that the full moon was on December 6, 1976, therefore, only two days before, and dogs were perhaps howling to the lunar crescent but it is very doubtful, for the moon was visible since hours and the dogs had not howled before or after 23hOO. On the following day, Thursday December 9,1976, the same two staff sergeants made the same journey from Meyronnes to Maisonmeane, when with astonishment, they can NORTH MIRANDOL PASS MEYRONNES LARCHE MAISONMEANE LARCHE PASS BARCELONNETTE(ALPES DE HAUTE-PROVENCE) FRANCE 10 KM 10 MILES see an astounding phenomenon. Not a single, but four objects are flying from the same direction of the Larche Pass (Italian border, at the S.-E.), without noise, to the direction, of Mirandol Pass at the N.-E. (the altitude of Larche Pass is of 1997m/ 6650 feet, a little less than Mirandol Pass). These four objects are flying at 500-1500m (1630-4920 feet) from the ground level, therefore at about 3000m (9850 feet). A little light has been visible under one of the four things during a moment. As the wit- nesses arrived at theirs quarters, they had heard about the fact that the dogs have howled in the same man- ner than the day before, at the same hour, when the four objects have been visible, at 23hOO. The same Thursday, December 9, 1976 another witness was with Mr. Gaborris and Mr. Charrins: the sergeant Pierrat, also from the llth B.C.A of Maisonmeane. In addition, another serious witness has seen these four objects, but from the Larche Pass on Thursday 9: a custom officer of the custom-house of Larche Pass, Mr. Phillibert. Following these strange facts, a night watch was organized at Larche Pass by the soldiers of the llth B.C.A. and members of the French force of gendarmes (Gendarmerie Nationale) on the evening of Friday 10, Saturday 11, and Sunday 12, without result. The things seen on"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the two evenings quoted cannot have been a star, the moon, or another atmospheric phenomenon, or satel- lite. As has said the Commandant of the Brigade of Alpine Light Infantry Mr. Vausson, about the observation of Wednesday, December 8, 1976 by the two staff-sergeants Gaborris and Charrins: \"They have noted in the sky a dark object, of circular shape, as big as a large aircraft, This shape, luminous in its center, which could have been at 600m (1970 feet) above them; had stopped a while just before deissappearing a minute after behind the mountains\". About the observation of Thursday, December 9 the same commandant Vausson has been quoted as saying: \"Suddenly, one (of the four objects) of them had separated from the others, and had been flying towards the witnesses who have been very afraid. Then, abruptly, the engine has disappeared at an astonishing speed, as the three others\"...About the night-watches, the chief of the Brigade of force of gendarmes of Barcelonnette-Captain Jean-Yves Montfort, himselfl-has been watching without result at Larche Pass on the nights of 10 to 11,11 to 12, and 12to 13. It is of interest to quote, also, that another witness who was driving his car in .the same country has seen the phenomenon (on December 8 or 9, at the same hour). This later witness was a civil one; and his name was not divulged by the trench \"Gendar- merie\". It is a pity when we see that such interesting reports cannot be freely given to all the interested men, by the french force of gerd- armes. But, as has written Kipling, this is another question... When questioned by the same Jean-Yves Montfort, about their observation of Thursday December 9, Mr. Gaborris and Mr. Charrins and Mr. Pierrat are quoted to have said: \"The meteorological conditions were nearly identical than during the night before (night of the first observation, on December 8). Almost at the same spot, while we were driving to the Larche Pass, we have seen four objects, identical to the one of the day before, following nearly the same tra- jectory, at almost the same altitude. Immediately, we have stopped, cut the engine off, switched off the head- . lamps, and we have went out of the car and walked on the road. \"The four objects have been moving forward in an impressive dead silence, without the faintest light, along a rectilinear trajectory (Remember of Orthoteny...), perfect- ly aligned. We have succeeded in seeing their flight during about ten seconds. They have been at about two kilometers (6550 feet), barely, and, again, our dogs have howled during their passage. Ourselves had experienced a sufficiently important fright.\" It certainly was not natural, the witnesses being in no means ac- customed with such fantastic events, all the men agreed at this subject. Furthermore, the things are totally noiseless, and such a fact that on not be explained, as the things are relatively close. And we have the fact that on the observation of December 9, one of the four objects was seen flying towards panic- stricken witnesses...Such an intelli- gent comportment cannot be easily explained, it seems... Another member of french force of gendarmes (Gendarmerie Nation- ale) from the town of Barcelonnette has declared on the waves of the french radio broadcast (France- Inter), on December 13, 1976, at 09hOOa.m.: \"It would have been of a cylindrical shape (during the first observation on December 8, of one object only), as big as a large aircraft, of a dark grey tinge, but during the night it would have been very difficult to know exactly the colour. And the fact has oc- curred two times. The first time, they have seen only one object with a luminous spot in its middle. The second time, there were four objects and they had flown at great speed without noise. Actually, we are still investigating on the observations. But, about the veracity of the facts, we think all has really occurred, of course, for the witnesses are serious and well-known men, and worthy of interest. And, too, we have the curious fact that, as it seems, the dogs of the company (\"les chiens du peloton cynophile\") at the quarters of Maisonmeane, near the Larche Pass, would have howled three evenings consecutively\" Therefore, on December 7 without known observation, on December 8, and December 9, we can add that in the folk tales, the fact for a witness to meet for three consecutive days Fairies is the general rule...Strange, isn't it.  5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Acapulco Conference By Dennis William Hauck Contradictory feelings of chaos and progress marked the First Inter- national UFOlogy Conference, held in Acapulco, Mexico, from April 17 to 24. The complicated logistics of bringing together the world's most prominent ufologists for a week of interlingual debate took their toll as personal inconveniences and organi- zational delays mounted throughout the week. Nonetheless, the Confer- ence succeeded in bringing together leading UFO researchers with widely divergent attitudes and real progress was made on a number of important points.

It has been the author's experience that only about 2 to 3 % of raw data sightings received turn out to be scientifically valuable \"un- knowns\", not 20%, the commonly accepted figure. The case of the Glendale helicopter sighting of Feb- ruary 1st, 1977 was presented last month in this Journal (Part I) as a likely \"unknown\" or UFO. The trouble with the Glendale helicopter case is that it happened at the same time and location as hoax balloon activity of an unfamiliar type. Are we, therefore, forced to some to the conclusion that the two professional and trained observers who were encountering a strange \"craft\" 1100 feet above the city of Glendale were, in fact, viewing an errant hoax balloon? In order to try to answer this knotty problem, let us consider the nature of the hoax balloon reports in Glendale on and around February 1st. At about 8:00 p.m. on January 28th 1977 on Sparr Blvd. which borders the area over which the helicopter sighting occurred, a 16-year-old girl, H.C., saw a bright yellowish light rising up in the south. As it went out of sight at the top of her window frame she ran outside to catch sight of it again, meanwhile calling to her mother. The two witnesses stood on their drive- way while the light wandered east- ward, then straight up again, clearing the tops of nearby tree. Above the bright, steady light was an indistinct black mass, onto which little or none of the light source reflected. It made another bend east and then started H.C.'s sketch of light with dark indistinct mass above. Feb. 1, 1977 Sparr Blvd., Glendale sighting. drifting northerly at 12 degrees elevation, slowly rising higher. It now kept a straight path seemingly only a couple of hundred feet high, but its motion was \"floating\" rather than controled. Apparent size of the light was about one-half the full moon. As it climbed, it diminished from view in the NNE at 60 degrees elevation. Duration of the sighting was about 10 minutes. (Figure A) Rather awed by the occurrence, the younger witness was doubly startled the next two nights. From her room on these two subsequent evenings she saw identical lights in the south. On the 29th, the object remained below 20 degrees elevation, half- hidden behind trees and evidently traveling in a southerly direction. As before, the light was very bright and close. On January 30th, the light drifted toward the east, traveling upward and disappearing behind a neighbor's house. The young girl's mother and brother were witnesses with her and all three described the light as comparable to a car's head- light 'on high beams from one-half block away. On February 1st, the night of the helicopter sighting, at about 8:35 p.m. H.C. and a 17 year-old friend, Kaye Brown, were in her room on Sparr Blvd. listening to records, when she saw the fourth appearance of the strange light. The two girls dashed outside and watched the light, self- contained as before, maneuvering in a lazy drifting pattern from east to west across the southern sky. At the same time, they heard neighbor boys laughing in a yard two doors down. They did not pay much atten- tion as the boys concerned, H.C. stated later, are \"nocturnal\" and always working and kidding around with friends in their garage. As the light, with its dark mass above it, floated back and forth in the sky (Figure B), Kaye called her mother. Mrs. Brown, who lives only a few blocks from the C. home, could not see the light, which indicated that the light was comparatively near the Sparr Blvd. location. H.C. contin- ued to watch while Kaye was on the phone and saw the light continue an upward path into the southern sky turn orange and fade out of sight into the distance about 8:50 p.m. Checking the wind directions later,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"it was determined that on all four nights of the Sparr Blvd. sightings, the winds were light. On all four nights the wind direction was consis- tent with the directions of the object's travel, and on the evenings of variable winds, the drifting \"maneuvers\" could be accounted for by shifts in wind direction. Therefore, it was decided that the Sparr Blvd. sightings were probably hoax balloons. But of what type? They were cer- tainly not ordinary hot-air or candle balloons. There were no lighted bags, flickering, or dropping of flam- ing particles, common to candle balloon sightings. They were not highway flares on helium-filled bags, as these have a typical sputtering effect entirely different from the steady, brilliant Sparr Blvd. objects. A valiant effort was made to track down the young hoaxers, but these efforts were met with hostile silence from the suspected boys and their parents. If any reader knows of a new type of hoax balloon which fits the above description, it would be very good to hear. We are left with a delimna. South of Glorietta Park, a few blocks from Sparr Blvd., a helicopter with two hardheaded, professional observers was circling with a precisely controlled \"craft\". The evidence of the hoax balloon activity was presented to these witnesses. Their answer again spoke eloquently: they unqualifiedly replied that they were certain, judging from their observation of reference points during the encounter, that they were orbiting with the object, not merely circling around it. No way, in their opinion, could it have been any kind of balloon drifting with the wind. It is the author's opinion that the two helicopter observers did not see, and misidentify, a hoax balloon. 10 There are points of similarity, to be sure, such as the bright yellowish light and the markings or \"struts\", not unlike those in some candle balloons. But there are four major points of difference between the object they encountered and the objects seen from the ground: 1. The objects of Sparr Blvd. acted like balloons, with drifting flight and lazy maneuvers. The \"craft\" which the helicopter encountered maneuvered precisely. At three crucial points during the observation it seemed to perform intelligent counter-reactions; 2. The dark, indistinct mass above the bright light seen from the ground reflected little or no light, whereas the object high in the air reflected light up onto two-thirds of its cylindrical body. But still the reflected light is entirely dissimilar to that of any known type of hoax balloon; 3. Though carefully questioned, none of the Sparr Blvd. witnesses on February 1st saw or heard a helicopter or other aircraft near or circling around the light, even though the object that night was watched for 10-15 full minutes during the time of the helicopter sighting. A glance at the map indicates that the major part of the helicopter encounter occurred several blocks south of Sparr Blvd. Massive efforts have failed to find any witnesses who saw a heli- copter circling with or around a light in the area involved. 4. The manner of disappearance of the helicopter's strange traveling companion was instantaneous, unlike the gradual disappearance of the objects seen from the ground. Therefore, it seems reasonable to think that the helicopter observers were seeing a bird of quite a different feather—not a hoax balloon. Could it have been an \"unknown\" mimicking some of the characteristics of the boy-made objects drifting below?

Rod B. Dyke, a MUFON Staff Member, publishes one of the finest UFO Newsclipping Services on a monthly basis, that not only includes UFOs, but Bigfoot, Fortean events, and at times cattle mutilations. In- formation concerning a subscription to his service may be secured by writing to: \"U.F.O. NEWSCLIP- PING SERVICE\", 4540 - 8th Avenue N.E., Suite 404, Seattle, Washington 98105.

ByRonWestrum In the current issue of Flying Saucer Review (Vol. 22, #5) there is an article by John Brent Musgrave on \"The UFO Investigator as Counsellor and Healer\". I had the pleasure of meeting John Musgrave at the CUFOS conference in Chicago and it is from this conference that the article is reprinted. I would like to recom- mend this article to all investigators of close encounter cases. I would like to make some further remarks to amplify some of John's points. First, however, I would like to relate a case in which the importance of the inves- tigator's role as healer was very forcefully brought to my attention. In this case the percipient in a close encounter case had experienced a number of physiological and emo- tional problems following her-experi- ence. She tried to get help from many official agencies but was re- buffed. Finally she managed to make contact with a UFO organization I will call group I. The investigators from group I meant well. They wanted to believe that the percipient had really had a close encounter but they were put off by her exotic labeling of routine events (some of her UFOs turned out to be: a porch light, the planet Jupiter, airplanes). An attempt at amateur hypnosis failed. After the failure of the efforts of group I, the witness still wanted to achieve some understanding of her experience. At this point group II (a rival organization) entered the picture. The representative of group II immediately established a close rapport with the witness, successfully hynotized her, and continued to treat her experience not from an objective scientific viewpoint but as an involved counsel- lor and healer. This treatment aided the witness in recovering her emotional balance and in dealing with the continuing anomalous experiences to which she was subject I am happy to report that the repre- sentatives of group I, rather than fighting over the jurisdication of the case, then realized their own failure and co-operated with group II in continuing to investigate the case. That this case is a success rather than a failure is the result of one organization's realization that the problem was not merely one of scientific investigation, but one of therapy. There are undoubtedly many other cases where such a real- ization would have been very valu- able, in which much suffering on the part of the percipient could have been alleviated by therapeutic action. So far I am merely recapitulating Musgrave's argument. One must go farther, however. Very often the person who has had a close encounter will become the subject of various types of para- normal events. They many experi- ence poltergeist manifestations, become telepathic and/or clairvoyant Things may go wrong with their telephone. They may have spectral visitations or feel they communicate with extraterrestrials. Their attitude toward life may become changed to paranoia or a \"new religious con- sciousness\". These effects and many others have been detailed by John Keel in a series of books. W Some of them seem to be caused directly by the \"other intelligences\" behind the UFO phenomenon. But it also seems that some of these effects are due to a kind of \"psychic amplification\" a growing psychic ability on the part of the percipient. ' The trigger for this psychic ampli- fication seems to be seme kind of mental disturbance. Close contact with the UFO phenomenon may disturb the mental equilibrium of the percipient in such a way that these effects manifest themselves. Nandor Fodor suggested many years ago that poltergeist cases usually were caused when a disturbed individual's mind unleashed its own paranormal powers. (2) in many cases the psychic conflicts involved were of a relatively routine nature, caused by sexual problems, repressed hostility, and so forth. It seems, however, that UFO close encounters can also be a shock to the percipient's mind, and that the conflict between the experi- . ence and percipient's sense of reality can release a range of paranormal events. Not only percipients but UFO investigators also can become the victims of this psychic amplification. Direct contact with the \"other intelligences\" is of course the strongest releaser of these efforts, but closeness to the phenomenon in any way may bring about the same mental conflicts and the same mani- festations. It would appear that psychic amplification has been the cause for the withdrawal of a sub- stantial number of major and minor UFO investigators from active work."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"What can be done about this problem? I am not sure. Certainly the first order of business is to talk about it more. I suspect a large number of investigators have come across it at one time or another, but because of embarassment or uncer- tainty about its nature, have kept it essentially within .a small circle. Talking about, it would also help remove some of the stigma which now attaches to the subject. More important, however, is the genera- tion of more information about the extent and development of this phenomenon. What kinds of percip- ients are subject to it? In what ways does it develop? How can one channel it toward outcomes which are positive and healthy for the perci- pient? The psychic abilities which the percipient is acquiring can be an asset instead of a liability, but only if the percipient is willing to accept them and view them as a new-found talent. If one can create an atmos- phere of acceptance, both in the percipient himself and in his social circle, the psychic amplification can be integrated into the percipients's personality. This attitude of accept- ance cannot exist, however, if the investigator himself does not accept the psychic effects or is afraid of them. He must make the percipient feel that what is happening to him is natural and even beneficial in the long run, although in the early stages it may be somewhat unsettling. In the process of getting the percipient to accept and live with his new-found abilities, the use of a parapsychologist or a psychologist/ psychiatrist familiar with the para- normal is desirable. Unfortunately, parapsychologist are a rare breed and may be hard to find. Nonethe- less, there is nothing to prevent the 12 researcher from familiarizing himself with some of the parapsychological literature. (3) An important benefit that the para- psychological framework brings is that it provides a naturalistic ap- proach to the percipient's experi- ences. Many percipients might otherwise interpret their experiences in religious or occult terms; some may in any case. By learning to see his powers in naturalistic terms, the percipient is less likely to feel estranged from the rest of the community, and is less likely to see himself as deviant. These thoughts are offered as a step toward understanding what I believe to be a serious problem. I hope other researchers whose experiences or thinking is more advanced along these lines will now come forward to offer their own ideas.

FRAGMENTARY REPORT ON SWEDISH ABDUCTION CASE By Richard Hall, MUFON Interna- tional Coordinator (Information from UFO-NYT, 5-76, Sobory, Denmark, translated by Soren Buus, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada). An incomplete and anonymous report from the Scandinavian UFO Information Center, leaving much more information to be desired before it can be properly evaluated, describes an alleged abduction case occurring on the night of March 22- 23, 1974. The report has numerous features in common with parallel U.S. cases. While driving home from a party, Mr. A. felt a sudden force on his car that pulled it to the right side of the road into the area of a small farm. Pulled along against his will, Mr. A. and his car passed between two runic stones, at which point a powerful beam of light came from above and to the left. He was pulled upward by the light beam, despite strong resis- tance, and encountered four \"hugh transparent beings in very old fash- ioned dress.\" Mr. A. resisted, fighting to get free; suddenly he felt pain in his cheek and some blood flowing. He was transported home by the beings, where his wife cleaned the blood from his face. Below his temple was a round hole. He suffered from light burns, especially in the facial area. Mr. A. \"thought he had been taken for a medical examination.\" The Swedish UFO Information group is reported to be investigating."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Fencehouses Humanoid Encounter Report 7699 September 3,1976 Time 21.00 Investigated by John Rouse (CONTACT) It is unfortunate that the reporting witness to this case is an elderly lady (age 63) who was very frighten- ed and wishes no publicity. There was an 18 year old witness with her, but she has not so far been traced. However, the investigator for NUFON, John Rouse, believes the case to be genuine. Mrs. A and Miss B were returning from a visit to some relatives. They were walking past a waste area in the little village of Fencehouses, county Durham. The area has in fact since been levelled for building, and is littered with disused mine shafts. They saw a strange object upon a mound of earth. It was very small, and exact measurements proved possible owing to the events to be described. It was 5' long and 3-3Vi ' high—roughly oval in shape with a large glass like compartment in the centre and a bright orange dome on top. It was resting on sledge-like runners, which appeared to be made of chrome or steel. The witnesses were not afraid, but appeared to be attracted towards the object in almost a hypnotic fash- ion. As they approached closer they noticed an odd effect. There had been a moderate wind and scattered cloud in the twilight sky, but the wind seemed to suddenly stop. The trees appeared to stop swaying and the traffic on the nearby road seemed to THE OBJECT just disappear. The witnesses watches stopped at this point— although they worked normally after- wards. It was almost as if they were suspended in time. Mrs. A. was now right up to the craft and she was able to run her hand along the side of it. It was very smooth and glass-like and felt warm. This was the point where she was able to really take in the details of size and shape. Sudddenly two entities appeared by the side of the object. They were the size of dolls (which we take to mean about 1' tall). Basically they were humanoid in shape with long white hair parted down the middle. They had large eyes and claw-like fingers. They appeared to be frightened by the witnesses and put both hands up to their faces. At this point the story becomes somewhat confused. The witness was not sure what happened to the beings and became a little confused and disorientated, particularly as to time. It is possible that there is a time discrepancy of about half an By Jenny Raudles 23 Sunningdale Drive, Irlam, Gt. Manchester, England THE OCCUPANT hour, but there is by no means any certainty about this. The object was seen to take off at great speed, making a humming noise at the time. There was possibly a subsequent physiological effect. The next day Mrs. A was trying to plug in a vacuum cleaner at home. She found that she could not put the plug into the socket. It was as if some force were pushing her hands back (re- member she had touched the object). In the end her daughter had to do this job for her. Samples of soil and of vegatation are to be analysed and a radiation reading to be taken, although it is unlikely that they will show anything so long after the event. Bearing in mind the distress of the witness we were very fortunate to find out about the incident. This was indirectly and simply because she wanted to get the affair off her chest. There has been no publicity, al^ though it is obvious in consideration of the publicity given to the Winches- ter entity case of November 14th that 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"she could have easily achieved this had it been her aim. It does appear a reasonably logical reaction to now wish to forget the whole affair, al- though attempts are still being made to investigate matters in complete confidence. She is very worried about the consequences of the press getting hold of the story. One can make comparisons with other cases quite readily. The paral- lel with the story of Mrs. Lainchbury (see FSR 22-3) is interesting. She claimed visits from beings from Pluto seen in a similar trance like situation, and subsequently she reacted in a very similar manner—telling the story and then deciding she had said enough. She was of a very similar age. The prevalance of these type of cases, which I refer to as psychic contactee experiences' is remarkable Think of Mr. L from West Yorkshire (August 76 NUN) and Mrs. H from Belfast(Norhtern Ufology no.l). There has to be a common link factor here as to why these subjective experiences are being inflicted in greater number upon witnesses. There will probably be no trace of the object—almost as if it were not there. There was no trace of the Win- chester object (also an orange oval), and it had elements of the unreal about it. Yet because the event appears to be subjective does not mean we should ignore it. There is the possibility that whatever causes the ufo phenomenon has the ability to make us see just what it wants us to see or what we want to see. Let us hope that we are able to find out more about this case—and in particular that we receive the coober- ative story of the 18 year old girl. That would turn an intriguing case into a potentially classic encounter. 14 SCANDINAVIAN E-M CASES SUBMITTED BY RICHARD HALL, MUFON International Coordinator (Translated from UFO-NYT, 5-76, By S. Buus, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada A woman in Hordaland, Norway, was awakened at 1:00 a.m., June 22, 1975, by the sound of wildcats outside her house. While watching the wildcats, she hear the sound of her electric meter running faster than normal and continuing to speed up. At the same time she sighted two soundless unidentified objects in the southern sky. Moving slowly, they \"followed the power line in a climbing curve until they disappear- ed behind the bushes.\" The moon was full, and in its bright light the objects looked bronze in color. As soon as they disappeared, the electric meter returned to normal. A year later, at 12:40 a.m. on June 21, 1976, police officer Th. Brandt- Jensen near Ringsted, Zealand, Denmark, saw a bright blue-white light cross the road behind him and thought it might be an airplane in trouble trying to land on the road. He sped up to 150 km/h toward a crossroad where he could pull off the highway. The object caught up to within 50-75 meters and its light struck the car. As it did, the car motor stopped and all lights went out. The road was illuminated by the object, and Brandt-Jensen guided the coasting vehicle onto the shoulder. He got out and caught a glimpse of the object as it disap- peared behind local terrain. beam Glider-like UFO June 21,1976 Nr. Ringsted, Denmark The UFO resembled a glider (See Sketch), and was soundless except for a slight whistling sound like a glider makes. A ray of light from it swung back and forth (cf., April 1966, Ravenna, Ohio, police case) as it passed his car travelling over 100 kmh, then slowed down to 20-30 km/h. It appeared to be about 15 meters long. (This case is also reported in the English-language SUFOI Newsletter, 76/2-77/1,p.7). Also near Ringsted the day before, another witness reported the follow- ing, which occurred at 10:00 p.m.: \"As I left Kirkebjerg I noticed a flying object in the sky to my left with a sharp dazzling light in front of it. Suddenly the light turned towards me, the engine stopped and all light in the car went out. I let the car run to a stop on the shoulder of the road. I tried to start the car again but it was completely dead, then I went out of the car so the object stood directly above me. (It's color was yellow-gray the size about that of a glider, and no sound was heard). Within 2-3 minutes the object disappeared to the south-south west. I started my car again without any difficulty. The nearest traffic at that time was about 200-300 meters away.\""},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"SkyNet Log The Sylmar-Newhall Sighting October 9,1976 By Ann Druffel At 8:45 p.m. on the evening of October 9, 1976, Rick Lannard, 13, of Sylmar called SKYNET #3 (Druf- fel), having been referred by the police. A group of neighbors and his family were gathered at his home, and were viewing an object \"like a bright star, flashing blue, green and red\". The object had been in view since before 7:15 p.m.,and was fairly high in the east over a horizon of high hills. The Lannard family, comprised of the mother, Dolores Lannard, Rick, and his sister Lori, 10, had been alerted to the situation, by their neighbors Chuck and Charlotte Sanborn. Mrs. Sanborn had been aware of a similar object northwest, also flashing red, blue and green, for about an hour before she inform- ed anyone about it. In all, a group of ten or eleven per- sons watched the object in the west from 7:15 p.m. to 8:15 p.m. To some, it seemed as if it unrhythmic flashing was a form of \"signalling\" to the object; in the east. The northwestern object, which was seen to the right of a \"bright star\"' (presumably Venus), slowly moved closer to the horizon and disappeared; For a considerable time before it disap- peared, about eight or ten planes were seen circling in the sky in the vicinity of the object. The planes seemed to be small private craft, some possibly helicopters. They moved back and forth near the object, not actually circling it, but remaining in the general area of the sky. The witnesses were positive that the number of planes, plus their behavior was not part of any aircraft traffic pattern, but that the planes seemed to be ' 'looking at the object After the disappearance of the northwestern object, and during the time Rick Lannard was speaking to the investigator on the telephone, several planes, from about eight to ten in number, began moving back and forth in the eastern sky near the second object. These planes, too, appeared as if they were keeping watch on the object. The Lannards viewed the object and the planes through Rick's bi- noculars (exact size not known, but most likely 7x35). The object re- mained substantially of the same ap- pearance through the binoculars, not being increased very much in size. The same effect was noted on the planes. The optical aid could not bring in the planes sufficiently close for the witnesses to identify their types or sizes. This indicated that .the object was fairly far away from the witnesses' location. As Rick was talking on the phone, the object suddenly began to move toward the north, at an apparent speed slower than a plane. Its angle of motion was crosswise to that of the field of stars. The investigator referred Rick to SKYNET #63 (Ron and Judy Klusza) who live inNewhall about five miles north of Sylmar on the chance that SKYNET members in that area might be able to view the object. She also called #64 (Larry Putrick), about two miles norhtwest of Newhall, who reported that he saw two airplanes circling near his home \"as if looking for something\", but he could not see the object described by the Lannards. The next day, October 10th #63 Judy Klusza called stating that al- though she and her husband Ron were not at home at the time Lannard telephoned their home, Ron's mother Mrs. Marie Morgan was baby- sitting there. Mrs. Morgan had gone outside in response to Lannard's call at 8:50 p.m. and viewed an object maneuvering in her vicinity. The directions and time involved indicate strongly that Mrs. Morgan was seeing the same object which Rick Lannard had called about. \"I was at home,\" wrote Mrs. Morgan on her MUFON sighting questionnaire ' 'watching TV. A tele- phone call advised me a UFO was over our house and if I would go out- side, I would see it—I hurried out and caught sight of the object (against the southern sky) going west. Then another call advised my grand- daughter (Tracy, 7) it was turning and coming back. I stood at north end of patio and observed object circling back north to northeast to south to southwest and lost sight of it as it passed behind trees on hill going southwest. I thought object appeared unusual, a shape I had not seen before. It appeared to be shaped like a star, with the points illuminated, transparent inside with several colored lights in upper main angle. I had a clear view of the object It moved fast and fast smoothly as if gliding and I do not remember hear- ing any sound.\" During two phone interveiws with Mrs. Morgan, the investigator was impressed by her common sense- attitude. She avoided embellishment and speculative thinking, but admit- 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ted being intrigued by the definite shape of the object. She compared the size of the object at the time of sighting to the full moon, (actually two days past full) which was visible at the time quite near the horizon. She stated that the objects apparent size was sufficient \"to fit into the full moon\". However, since the moon was near the horizon, it appear- ed larger to the eye than its actual Vi degree apparent size. Therefore, it is assumed that the apparent size of the object was possibly close to one degree across its horizontal axis. . In questioning Mrs. Morgan over the meaning of \"transparent\" she explained that the inside of the \"star\" was dark-colored, except for several bright colored light in the upper angled portion. These lights were blue and red, and possibly white or green. The witness stated that the shape of the object was definite, not merely an impression or an attempt by her mind to see a shape between the five faint illumin- ated points which constituted the ends of the five points of the \"star\". She explained that the edges of the star-shaped were seen were clearly seen, though she had some difficulty describing the actual appearance of the edge. She said some light from the five faintly illuminated points trailed along the edges, making the star-shape definite. No stars were seen through the object, but Mrs. Morgan stated that this was because no stars were in the background as it flew. The lights in the upper angled portion were bright, but steady, at least as large as \"little stars\". She saw no planes circling the object during the sighting, which lasted approximately 45 seconds to one minute. Afterwards, she saw two planes, but they seemed part of 16 normal traffic and did hot appear to be chasing the object. This case, though falling into the category of \"nocturnal lights\" has more than average interest, due to the large number of witnesses, the fact that it represented a suc- cessful \"tracking\" between SKYNET locations, and because the \"star- shaped\" so vividly described by Mrs. Morgan would seem to be unique in the literature. To this investigator's knowledge, this shape has never been reported, even among those sightings later listed as \"identified\". For these reasons, the .incident warrants this written report, in the hope that other sightings might be correlated with it. (continued from page 3) spot by research teams, some war- ranting laboratory analyses. Also significant is the increasing number of recently reported UFO landing and close encounter incidents where, in some instances, witnesses also report humanoid activity. Weighing the massive evidence ac- cumulated since World War II, MUFON/GSW finds the UFO, and even its occupant stories, no laughing matter. UFO APPEARANCE RECOGNITION AND IDENTIFICATION TEST PROCEDURE By Walt Andrus A vital addition to any UFO organiza- tions Field Investigator's Manual or Handbook are ideas suggested in a published copyrighted paper by Richard F. Haines, Ph.D. titled \"UFO Appearance Recognition and Identification Test Procedure\". A statement from his introduction to the paper may \"wet your appetite\" Quoting Dr. Haines—\"There are several reasons to obtain reliable information from a witness concern- ing the appearance of the unidenti- fied flying object (UFO) perceived. The first is to be able to place its shape and details into defined cate- gories so that correlations can be made with other sighting details from the same and other witnesses. Such categorization and ' classification may help us understand better the common elements, range of individual differences in perceived shapes, and many smaller details which might be important. Such details will likely go unreported if a less rigorous technique is used. The second reason is to learn more about the true nature of the UFO phenomenon. Should a fixed rela- tionship exist between the shape and/or details of the UFO pheno- menon and its function or \"true\" identity, a systematic method for categorizing such information will help to uncover it. The procedure given here will also facilitate the computerization of perceived UFO characteristics which could make possible valuable statistic analysis.\" Dr. Haines expresses his gratitude to Jim McCampbell, Ray Fowler, and Troy Challenger for their helpful comments and also to Peri Cline for her patient work in cataloguing eye witness drawings. Serious consider- ation is being given to printing an insert for the MUFON FIELD IN- VESTIGATOR'S MANUAL so that this idea may be incorporated. In the meantime, any individuals de- siring specific information concern- ing this publication should write directly to Dr. Haines at the following address: Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., 325 Langton Avenue, Los Altos, California 94022 USA."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish In Others' Words The March 15 issue of National Enquirer reported on UFO sightings in the vicinity of Danbury, Conn, in August, 1976. Photographs of the sky objects were obtained. Iranian UFO reports, including an account of objects being chased by Phantom jets, were featured in the March 22 issue of the Enquirer. The April 5 issue told of a sighting by an airliner crew over India on July 22, 1976. A short item concerning Irwin Ginsburgh's new book, First, Man. Then, Adam!, appears in the April 12 issue of The Star. The Ginsburgh theories have to do with the \"ancient astronaut\" concept, based on Biblical references and Jewish legends. The #5 issue of True Flying Saucers & UFO Reports is now available. Much of the material in this issue is familiar, with Wendelle Stevens' article representing a noteworthy exception. Jerome Clark's interview with Dr. J. Allen Hynek in the April issue of OUI is, unfortunately, more of the same old stuff. If you have read one Hynek interview, you've read them all, However, the illustration accomp- anying the interview is, in my opinion, absolutely delightful. The May issue of Ancient Astrp= nauts is largely composed of specul- , ative and/or questionable material. Bruce Schaffenberger's article on historical UFO reports from Japan is quite interesting, but overall, this issue doesn't quite make it. Various articles on UFOs and \"ancient astronauts\" may be found in the May issue of Beyond Reality. Harv Howard's article on the 1896-97 \"airships\" has some items of interest. Mildred Higgins' article in the May issue of Fate points out the various ways that you, as a potential UFO witness, can be better prepared for such an event. Her reports on pre- viously unpublicized UFO sightings in southeastern Missouri are most interesting. In my opinion, Zecharia Sitchin's recent book, The 12th Planet, belongs at the top of the \"preferred reading list\" of books on the \"ancient astro- nauts\" subject. It, along with Robert Temple's The Sirius Mystery, repre- sents solid research, not just endless recounting of so-called \"ancient mysteries.\" Sitchin provides a complex cosmology with respect to the origin of the Earth and the human race, An intruder from outside the solar system—the \"12th Planet,\" Mard.uk—collides with the planet orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. Half of the shattered planet was re- formed as Earth, with the remainder becoming the asteroid belt. Marduk, according to Sitchin, is now in a 3600-year orbit, traveling from far beyond Pluto to the vicinity of the asteroid belt on its closest approaches to Earth. The inhabitants of Marduk, the \"NefiHm,\" first visited Earth nearly a half-million years ago, in search of gold and other metals for their technology. They created homo sapiens by genetic engineering and cloning, solely for the purpose of working their extensive mines. The author has spent thirty years in his research, basing his inter- pretations on translations of cuneiform writings of the Middle East, as well as the Old Testament. Not being a student of linguistics, I cannot judge the accuracy of Sitchin's interpre- tations, but his basic concepts are certainly most intriguing. The book is available from Stein & Day, Pub- lishers - Scarborough House - Briar- cliff Manor, NY 10510; the price is $12.95. A reminder that Leonard String- field's new book, Situation Red: The UFO Siege, will be out from Doubleday in May. Coral & Jim Lorenzen's latest Berkley paperback, UFO Abductions, is also due out in May.

Hind In Marandellas, Rhodesia, on the night of November 20th, 1976, John Butcher, farmer, his wife and 11 year old daughter, were on their way to have dinner with friends at a neighbouring farm. They were ap- proaching the drive of Makarara Farm, their destination, when they noticed a car coming towards them from quite far away. They turned into the drive and Mrs. Butcher swung round in her seat to see if the other car was following them. The car however, carried on around the bend and it was at this point that she caught sight of an orange object, hovering over part of their own land on Dindingwe Farm. Suddenly, the object moved sharp- ly to the left and Mrs. Butcher asked her husband to stop the car so that he could observe it himself. By this time the object was stationary again and then suddenly, it disappeared behind the gum plantation on their farm. Marandellas is a large farming area in Rhodesia, with mainly tobacco and maize farms and unlike most of Rhodesia, the farms are not too far away from one another. It was about 7 p.m. when the Butchers first saw the object and it was in sight for approximately IVt minutes. The night was clear and cloudless and warm enough for thin summer clothing. When Mr. Butcher first observed the object, it appeared as an orange ball of light about 100 feet up and about a mile from their position. The object did not change its shape nor its brightness, although it was brighter 18 than the moon and unlike a star. Mr. Butcher is sure of this as it moved erratically and appeared to be controlled in some way or another. In fact, it had almost the appearance of a flare, but there was no security operation in the area that night. Mr. Butcher is a Section Leader with the Police Reserve and would have been notified if there had been any action. Mr. Burl, Mr. Butcher's next door neighbour, also noticed the strange orange object. His first reaction was that there was some military action taking place. He went to see John Butcher the next day to report the light and was then told that it had not been a flare. There were many witnesses to the sighting. Several of Mr. But- cher's African farm laborers saw the Hght, but kept well away from it as they were convinced it was a 'spirit from the dead.' \"In fact,\" says John Butcher, \"they told me that they had met up with this 'spirit' before—and that the last time this happened—some two years previous- ly—it had given off a strange smell like two stones rubbed together.\" The following day Mr. Butcher searched the area thoroughly where the object had disappeared. He took 18 of his men with him, some of whom went very warily and heavily armed with sticks. They found noth- ing of note. Mr. Butcher has not been involved with UFOs before and is slightly skeptical of the whole subject. However, he now admits that during his 4Vi years in the Navy, and many nights spent in the open bush, he has never seen anything like this before. \"It was certainly not a star or a planet,\" he says, \"and if it had been a helicopter or a plane, someone would have heard the engine.\" Whilst not committing himself to space ships from other planets, he says he can only conclude that it was some form of Unidentified Flying Object. 1976MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS (84 pages) \"Swamp Gas Plus Ten - And Counting\" by Dr. J.

WaltAndrus Our Editor has done a review of the: \"Frist International Congress UFO Phenomenon\" in Acapulco, Mexico from April 17 to 24, 1977 in this issue of the JOURNAL, therefore I will only touch on personal points or observations. Mr. Guillermo Bravo must be commended for this fabulous undertaking to conduct a worldwide UFO Congress of this scope with only a few months of prior planning. The success of the Congress will be measured in subsequent months and years when it is determined if the actions taken and the cooperative international spirit exhibited pro- vides positive results in resolving this scientific problem. Dennis has reprinted pertinent paragraphs of the resolution that was composed for Prime Minister Eric M. Gairy of Grenada to be presented to the United Nations seeking the support of all nations of the world in a com- bined effort to solve this dilemma. Prime Minister Gairy met with the Secretary-General of the United Nations on Tuesday April 21, 1977 to set a date on the agenda to submit this resolution. Personally, I was immensely proud of the MUFON speakers at the Congress, since our people composed the largest contingent of any UFO organizatiion present and provided the scientific aspects so vitally need- ed to combat the followers of George Adamski who were very prevelent. Of the twenty-six speakers appearing six were MUFON officers or repre- sentatives. Commendations are to be extended to William H. Spaulding, Ray Stanford, Henry McKay, Charles Huffer (MUFON/Central European Section), Dennis W. Hauck, and your Director, Walt Andrus. Other col- leagues of MUFON on the speaking agenda were Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Allen Hendry, representing the Center for UFO Studies. It was a distinct pleasure to meet Jacques and Janine Vallee, and to renew friendships with John Keel and Jim Lorenzen. Having an op- portunity to meet and visit with Erich Von Daniken was a unique exper- ience. Other speakers that were a delight to meet were Pedro Ferriz (Mexico), Salvador Frexedo (Puerto Rico), James Hurtak (U.S.A.), Ian Norrie (England), Hans Peterson (Denmark), Antonio Ribera (Spain), Karl Veit (Germany), and Fabio Zerpa and wife (Argentina). The Congress was conducted upon such a grand scale, that at times it may have reached beyond the control of the organizers. It may have amazed Mr. Bravo that MUFON had our complete 1977 UFO SYMPOSIUM speakers and agenda printed for \"hand-outs\" at the Congress and the 1978 plans progressing rapidly, whereby the place, date, facilities, etc. have already been committed and reserved. Our thanks to the key people who assisted Mr. Bravo; Carlos Ortiz, Ken Smith, and Pedro Ferriz, just to name a few. The young adults from Mexico City, who were the hosts and hostesses, the competent translators of the speech- es via personal radio receivers into English, Spanish, and French were instrumental in making the event a success. The hotel accomodations and Convention Center facilities rank with the best in the world. My wife and I pass along our personal thanks to Bravo Guillermo and the \"beauti- ful people\" of Mexico that we met. As a result of personal contacts in Acapulco, the following people have become MUFON Foriegn Rep- resentatives: Prof. Ramon de Agular M.D., Apt. 681, Panama 9A. Repub- lic of Panama. Dr. Aguilar will also serve as a Consultant in Psychiatry. Mario Rodriques D'Agustino, B. Fragoso de Rivera, Montevideo, Uruguay, and electronic engineer, will represent MUFON in Uruguay. John D. Simhon, Apartado Aereo 90942, Bogota, Columbia will be our representative in Columbia. Teresita Delgado Fernandez, Muhifamiliar Juarez-Edif CL-207, Cal. ROMA &, Mexico City, D.F. Mexico, a teacher, will become a Field In vestigator. Fabio Zerpa, Driector of the Argentina magazine \"Cuan.a Dimension\" published in Buenos Aires and his wife have volunteered to write UFO articles from Argentina and South America for THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL.

Rehashed newspaper stories are all well and good, but in the end would not add much to our knowledge without the vital element of direct investigation. We all know that the newspapers typically are careless with facts and, under time pressures for daily publication, often distort reports—sometimes beyond recognition once we learn the facts directly. If MUFON (and the other groups) have a role to play, and I think they do, it lies in careful screening and investigation of UFO reports, not in accepting stories at face value and repeating them as if they constituted meaningful evident. Data-gathering and compilation of catalogues are of first importance, something the UFO groups collectively are uniquely equipped to accomplish, but the data will be of value ultimately in direct proportion to the amount of inves- tigation and checking that has gone into individual cases. Exactly on this point is where I part company with good friends and colleagues (as well as with philoso- phical opponents) on what the UFO \"evidence\" is, and what views or beliefs are justified. This applies especially and critically to humanoid occupant cases per se, and beyond humanoids to the very bizarre rash of alleged abduction cases new receiv- ing so much attention. I will be commenting on these basic questions frequently in the future, since they are at the heart of the UFO mystery, so my remarks here will be brief and general. In the recent past I have editor- ializd repeatedly about the tendency in ufology (which always ought to be printed in lower case) to rush to judgement in individual cases, a compulsion to reach final conclusions usually under the pressure of organi- zational \"face.\" Considering that mainline science with all its resources remains baffled about many con- siderably more mundane questions, I wonder how ufologists (typically part-time, with little or no resources and fragmented as they are) feel they can answer ultimate questions with finality. It makes no sense, and we ought to be more humble in the face of baffling data which, if ture, have profound implications. This preten- tiousness, or naivete, puts off well- qualified scientists who could apply their knowledge and skills to help unravel the UFO mystery. My observation has been only a tiny percentage of humanoid cases have been carefully and thoroughly investigated by independent re- searchers, and therefore that all our beliefs about them should be highly tentative. When we come to ab- duction reports, the problem is com- pounded by the complexity of the human mind and by the uncertainties of 'information' obtained under hyp- notic regression. A lot of research remains to be done on abduction cases, while suspending judgement about their ultimate meaning. This research should be done with in- creasing participation by well-quali- fied psychologists, psychiatrists, and hypnotists, for the simple reason that such reports are now widespread with many internal consistencies. That doesn't prove that people are. really being abducted and subjected to medical examinations; the answer may lie in some previously unsus- pected unconscious fears.common to humanity, or some sort .of socially transmitted fears. These are questions that ought to be probed in depth before we leap to any conclusions. If \"psychological\" answers connot account for the re- ports and the only remaining hypo- thesis is that the abductions must be accepted pretty much at face value, then clearly all mankind is faced with a problem so serious that it should be in the hands of the best specialists internationally. Well-meaning weekend amateurs (among whom I number myself) can do important work relative to UFOs, but we had better stop playing games and start to support a concerted, international, scientific effort if there is a chance that these stories are true. There is no way that we have answers much less the time, facilities, or resources to obtain them. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.
