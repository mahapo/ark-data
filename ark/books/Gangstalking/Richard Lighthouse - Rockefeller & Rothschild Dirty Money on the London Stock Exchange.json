Previously published as “Lloyd's Banking Group in London”, and “Fraud on the London Stock Exchange” Original 1A – 4 December 2016 Houston, Texas, U.S.A. Revision 3a – 27 December 2016 Rockefeller & Rothschild Dirty Money on the London Stock Exchange TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 2: Conclusions Chapter 3: References Abstract Rev 3A: Lloyd's Banking Group is probably the largest corporation in the world, with a global market capitalization exceeding $2.4 Quadrillion USD, according to Yahoo Finance. This company was formed in 1995, but based on its financials, it appears to be hiding trillions of dollars in assets. The total market capitalization of the stocks listed on the London Stock Exchange as LLD2, LLD5, LLD6, and LLD7 are quite large. In fact, it is larger than all other banks in the world combined. Think about that, because it bears repeating – One bank in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"London has more assets and value than all other banks in the world combined. It is at least 100 times larger than the next largest bank – JPMorganChase. $2.4 Quadrillion dollars is enough money to give every man, woman, and child on our planet, about $324,000.00 each. And still have money left over. That's enough money to solve global hunger. That's enough money to cure every disease. That's enough to provide good housing for everyone on the planet. And this is all held in one bank in London. So why is the London Stock Exchange trying to hide the value of these bank stocks? If you research this, you will find the value and number of shares of these LLD stocks are being altered on the internet. Other companies include Toyota TYT, Mitsubishi Electronics MEL, All Nippon Airways ANA, Ferrovia, Ricoh, Konami, and others. The financial information about these companies does not add up. ANA Holdings (All Nippon Airways) has about 200 aircraft as part of their operations and yet their market capitalization is $101 Trillion USD - more than 100 times greater than Delta, American, United, or Southwest Airlines. Another example, Mitsubishi Electric has a recent London market capitalization of $301 Trillion USD. This is a scale more than 15 times larger than the entire United States economy on an annual basis. Another example – Toyota Motor Corporation (TYT) has a London Stock Exchange market capitalization of $1.8 Quadrillion USD – this is about 1000 times larger than Ford, General Motors, or Chrysler. Globally, Toyota sells about the same number of vehicles as Volkswagen each year – this valuation does not make sense. There is no rational explanation for this magnitude of market capitalization. It is clear evidence that these stocks on the London Stock Exchange are being used as a vehicle to store large assets and hide them – many trillions of dollars. American companies appear to be part of this fraud on the London Stock Exchange as well, on a smaller scale – Boeing (BOE) $8.7 trillion USD, General Electric (GEC) $16.9 trillion USD, IBM (IBM) $14.5 trillion USD, Honeywell (HON) $8.3 trillion USD. Note the Price to Earnings ratios for these companies are inconsistent with any rational valuation. The hidden amounts are staggering, and it is clear that officials of the London Stock Exchange are complicit. The officers of the London Stock Exchange would have to know about these corrupt activities, since legal documents and registration for the number of shares and share price would have to be filed when the stock was issued. David Rockefeller, Jay Rockefeller, Jacob Rothschild, Evelyn Rothschild, David Rothschild, Nathaniel Rothschild. Please read \"The Money Mafia\" by Paul Hellyer, former Acting Prime Minister of Canada and Defense Minister. One of the things that Mr Hellyer could not explain in his book – where did the Rockefellers and Rothschilds hide their ill-gotten money. Most of these companies are required to file official documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) each year. These criminals can be charged with Felony Fraud under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Readers are encouraged to research these companies and help identify the fraud. Please help us bring down these criminals. The day that this ebook was published, the criminals hacked and altered the yahoo website by deleting the listings or values for LLD2, LLD5, LLD6, and LLD7; but there are other ways to document the true stock listings.

Lloyd's Banking Group is the largest corporation in the world, according to Yahoo Industry Financials. In fact, it is larger than all other banks in the world combined. It is at least 100 times larger than the next largest bank – JPMorganChase. $2.4 Quadrillion dollars is enough money to give every man, woman, and child on our planet, about $324,000.00 each.

And this is all held in one bank in London. So why is the London Stock Exchange trying to hide the value of these stocks? And where is LLD3 and LLD4? Are these shares privately issued and held to hide the value? The market capitalization is a simple equation, market price times the number of shares. How can major publications like Barron's, Yahoo Finance, Wall Street Journal mess up something so simple? Or maybe they are each being given different false information?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Figure 1.

This does not include LLD2, LLD3, LLD4, LLD7. Note that LLD2 and LLD7 were listed last year at nearly $800 Trillion USD each. See Figure 7.

And that's without all of the listed shares. https://biz.yahoo.com/p/410mktd.html But something else does not add up. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) says that the market capitalization of Lloyds Banking Group (LLD5) is 39.5 Billion pounds or about $48B USD. However, when we compare this to Yahoo, Barron's, and the Wall Street Journal information – we see a significant disagreement. Figure 3. London Stock Exchange quote for LLD5 on 30 October 2016. LLD5 and LLD6 are both listed on the London Exchange. This screen shot is direct from the London Stock Exchange web site."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Figure 4. Barron's information for LLD5. Note the 1% of the shares held by Vanguard is 713.54 million shares at $109.25 per share. That's a large difference. This means that the Barron's and Yahoo numbers disagree with the market cap quoted on the London Stock Exchange. And it means that 100% of the shares are worth far more than the 39.5 billion pounds ($48 Billion USD) mentioned on the London Stock Exchange. Note that the largest shareholders only have a few percent interest in the corporation. Under “Direct Holders” - HM Treasury holds about 6 billion shares. If we asked the fund managers at Vanguard - “What is the percent of outstanding shares held by your stock fund?”, they would probably know the correct number. And it may be different than what we see here."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Figure 5. Wall Street Journal summary for LLD5."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Figure 6.

The same Yahoo site in October 2015 quotes LLD6 and LLD7 as each having nearly $800 Trillion USD. It appears that in hiding these assets – they split them between LLD5, LLD6, and LLD7 about equally. The total for for Lloyd's Banking Group then exceeds $2.4 Quadrillion dollars, making it the world's largest corporation. Maybe that's something the owners wanted to hide... According to wikipedia – there are 7.4 billion people on our planet as of August 2016. ( https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population ) $2.4 Quadrillion dollars is enough money to give every man, woman, and child on our planet, about $324,000.00 each. And still have money left over. That's enough money to solve global hunger. That's enough money to cure every disease. That's enough to provide good housing for everyone on the planet. And this is all held in one bank in London. Figure 8. London Stock Exchange claims LLD6 has a market capitalization of 39.5 billion pounds. At a minimum, this is very misleading, and it is probably fraudulent."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Figure 9. To complicate matters, this recent article states that the U.K. government is selling its stake in the Lloyd's Banking Group, and that it is about 6.5 billion pounds. However, this is only one of the company's listed stock funds – a smaller stock fund with a market capitalization of about $40 billion USD. Is it possible the “bailout” by the U.K. government is really an attempt to confuse and hide the origin of the market shares and the true market capitalization of the other large stock funds owned by the company? Many things about this company's stock simply do not add up. I wonder if the citizens of the U.K. would knowingly allow a “bailout” of a company that has hundreds of trillions of British pounds under its umbrella?"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Figure 10.

In fact, by reading row 2, it can be seen that this company is larger than all of its industry competitors combined. ($301 trillion versus $321 trillion for the industry) Figure 12. ANA Holdings is the parent of All Nippon Airways. This company has a London market capitalization of $101 trillion USD. This is more than 100 times larger than Delta, United, American, or Southwest Airlines. This simply does not make sense based on their scale of operations. Trillions of dollars are being hidden under the corporate veil. Ryanair Holdings, RYA, looks suspicious as well. Conclusions Some readers may be willing to conclude that the yahoo numbers are simply wrong – what they are saying then, is a multibillion dollar corporation with hundreds of employs working on the data you see in these tables – are unable to multiple two numbers together correctly to obtain the market capitalization. Does that make sense? The number of shares times the price per share is the market capitalization. Some readers will claim a multibillion corporation cannot multiply two numbers together correctly, and they have continued to make this mistake for many years, and left it uncorrected. This is not likely. So what is likely? We have described what appears to be deliberately misleading information on the London Stock Exchange, regarding the stock of Lloyd's Banking Group. The major media frequently quote Apple Computer as being the largest corporation in the world, when it is not even close. Lloyd's Banking Group has a market capitalization that is clearly larger than Apple's $600 Billion USD. Why are we being lied to about the market capitalization of"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"this bank? Even JPMorganChase is larger than Apple's $600 Billion. So why is the media lieing to us about the size of these banks? Even if the Yahoo Finance numbers are off, the large differences between the London Stock Exchange, Barron's and the Wall Street Journal cannot be dismissed. Someone is deliberately misleading or hiding the true value. Both Barrons and the Wall Street Journal disagree with the market cap stated by the London exchange. This short document has provided evidence that statements about the market capitalization of Lloyd's Banking Group are misleading and fraudulent. It is probably the largest corporation in the world, and this one corporation has enough wealth to solve many of the world's major problems. This corporation probably has ties to the Rockefeller's and the Rothschild's. It is possible that the recent “bailout” by the UK government is really an attempt to hide the true market capitalization of this company. There are too many things about these companies and their financial information that does not add up. The Rockefeller and Rothschild crime families can be charged with Felony Fraud under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).
