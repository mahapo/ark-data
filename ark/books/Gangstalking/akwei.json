Table of Contents The NSA's mission and the NSA's domestic Intelligence operation. Communications Intelligence (COMINT) Blanket coverage of all electronic communication in the U.S. and the world to ensure national security . The NSA at Ft. Meade, Maryland has had the most advance d computers in the world since the early 1960's. NSA technology is developed and implemented in secr et from private corporations, academia, and the ge- neral public. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) The Signals Intelligence mission of the NSA has evo lved into a program of decoding EMF waves in the environment for wirelessly tapping into computers a nd tracking persons with the electrical currents in their bodies. Signals Intelligence is based on the fact t hat everything in the environment with an electric current in it has a magnetic flux around it which gives off EMF waves. The NSA/DoD has developed proprietary advanced digital equipment which can remotely analy ze all objects whether man-made or organic that hav e electrical activity."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2 Domestic Intelligence (DOMINT) The NSA has records on all U.S. citizens. The NSA g athers information on U.S. citizens who might be of interest to any of the over 50,000 NSA agents (HUMI NT). These agents are authorized by executive order to spy on anyone. The NSA has a permanent National Security Anti-Terrorist surveillance network in pla - ce. This surveillance network is completely disguis ed and hidden from the public. Tracking individuals in the U.S. is easily and cost -effectively implemented with the NSA's electronic surveillance network. This network (DOMINT) covers the entire U. S., involves tens of thousands of NSA personnel, an d tracks millions of persons simultaneously. Cost effective implementation of operations is assured by NSA comp uter tech- nology designed to minimize operations costs. NSA personnel serve in Quasi-public positions in th eir communities and run cover businesses and legiti mate busi- nesses that can inform the intelligence community o f persons they would want to track. N.S.A. personne l in the community usually have cover identities such as soc ial workers, lawyers and business owners. Individual citizens occasionally targeted for surve illance by independently operating NSA personnel. NSA personnel can control the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals in the U.S. by using the N SA's domestic intelligence network and cover businesses. The operations independently run by them can some- times go beyond the bounds of law. Long-term contro l and sabotage of tens of thousands of unwitting ci ti- zens by NSA operatives is likely to happen. NSA Dom int has the ability to covertly assassinate U.S. ci ti- zens or run covert psychological control operations to cause subjects to be diagnosed with ill mental health. Table of Contents NSA's domestic electronic surveillance network As of the early 1960's the most advanced computers in the world were at the NSA, Ft. Meade. Research breakthroughs with these computers were kept for th e NSA. At the present time the NSA has nanotechnolo gy com- puters that are 15 years ahead of present computer technology. The NSA obtains blanket coverage of information in the U.S. by using advanced computers that use artif icial intelli- gence to screen all communications, irregardless of medium, for key words that should be brought to th e attention of NSA agents/cryptologists. These computers monitor a ll communications at the transmitting and receiving ends. This blanket coverage of the U.S. is a result of the NSA 's Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) mission. The NSA's electronic surveillance network is based on a cellular arrangement of devices that can monit or the entire EMF spectrum. This equipment was developed, impleme nted, and kept secret in the same manner as other e lectronic warfare programs. With this technology NSA personnel can non-obtrusiv ely tap into any communication device in existence. This includes computers, telephones, radio and video-bas ed devices, printers, car electronics, and even the minute electri- cal fields in humans (for tracking individuals). Signals Intelligence Remote Computer Tampering The NSA keeps track of all PCs and other computers sold in the U.S. This is an integral part of the Do mestic Intelli- gence network. The NSA's EMF equipment can tune in RF emissions fr om personal computer circuit boards (while filterin g out emissions from monitors and power supplies). The RF emission from PC circuit boards contains digital i nformation in the PC. Coded RF waves from the NSA's equipment can resonate PC circuits and change data in the PC' s. Thus the NSA can gain wireless modem-style entry into an y computer in the country for surveillance or anti- terrorist electronic warfare. Radio and Television signals can be substituted at the receiving end with special EMF equipment. Repla cing signals in Radios and Televisions is another outgrowth of t he NSA's Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) mission. Detecting EMF Fields in Humans for Surveillance. A subject's bioelectric field can be remotely detec ted, so subjects can be monitored anywhere they are . With special EMF equipment NSA cryptologists can remotely read e voked potentials (from EEGs). These can be decoded into a person's brain-states and thoughts. The subject is then perfectly monitored from a distance. NSA personnel can dial up any individual in the cou ntry on the Signals lntelligence EMF scanning netwo rk and the NSA's computers will then pinpoint and track that p erson 24 hours-a-day. The NSA can pick out and trac k anyone in the U.S. Table of Contents "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3 NSA Signals Intelligence Use of EMF Brain Stimulation NSA Signals Intelligence uses EMF Brain Stimulation for Remote Neural Monitoring (RNM) and Electronic Brain Link (EBL) . EMF Brain Stimulation has been in development sin ce the MKUltra program of the early 1950's, which included neurological research into \" radiation\" (non-ionizing EMF) and bioelectric resea rch and deve- lopment. The resulting secret technology is categor ized at the National Security Archives as \"Radiatio n Intelligen- ce,\" defined as \"information from unintentionally e manated electromagnetic waves in the environment, n ot inclu- ding radioactivity or nuclear detonation.\" Signals Intelligence implemented and kept this tech nology secret in the same manner as other electroni c warfare programs of the U.S. government. The NSA monitors a vailable information about this technology and with holds scientific research from the public. There are also international intelligence agency agreements to ke ep this techno- logy secret. The NSA has proprietary electronic equipment that a nalyzes electrical activity in humans from a distan ce. NSA computer-generated brain mapping can continuously m onitor all the electrical activity in die brain con tinuously. The NSA records aid decodes individual brain maps (of h undreds of thousands of persons) for national secur ity purpo- ses. EMF Brain Stimulation is also secretly used by the military for Brain-to-computer link. (In milit ary fighter aircraft, for example.) For electronic surveillance purposes electrical act ivity in the speech center of the brain can be tran slated into the subject's verbal thoughts. RNM can send encoded sig nals to the brain's auditory cortex thus allowing a udio commu- nication direct to the brain (bypassing the ears). NSA operatives can use this to covertly debilitate subjects by simu- lating auditory hallucinations characteristic of pa ranoid schizophrenia. Without any contact with the subject, Remote Neural Monitoring can map out electrical activity from th e visual cortex of a subject's brain and show images from th e subject's brain on a video monitor. NSA operative s see what the surveillance subject's eyes are seeing. Visual memory can also be seen. RNM can send images direct to the visu- al cortex. bypassing the eyes and optic nerves. NSA operatives can use this to surreptitiously put ima ges in a surveil- lance subject's brain while they are in R.E.M. slee p for brain-programming purposes. Table of Contents Capabilities of NSA operatives using RNM There has been a Signals Intelligence network in th e U.S. since the 1940's. The NSA, Ft. Meade has in place a vast two-way wireless RNM system which is used to track subjects and non-invasively monitor audio-visual in formation in their brain. This is all done with no physical c ontact with the subject. RNM is the ultimate method of surveillance and domestic intelligence. Speech and 3D sound, and subliminal audio can be sent to the auditory corte x of the sub- ject's brain (bypassing the ears) and images can be sent into the visual cortex. RNM can alter a subje ct's perceptions, moods, and motor control. Speech cortex/auditory cortex link has become the u ltimate communications system for the intelligence community. RNM allows for a complete audio-visual brain-to-bra in link or brain-to-computer link. Table of Contents National Security Agency Signals Intelligence Electronic Brain Link Technology NSA SigInt can remotely detect, identify and monito r a person's bioelectric fields. The NSA's Signals Intelligence has the proprietary ability to remotely and non-invasively monitor info rmation in the human brain by digitally decoding the evoked potent ials in the 30-50 hz, .5 milliwatt electro-magnetic emissions from the brain. Neuronal activity in the brain creates a shifting e lectrical pattern that has a shifting magnetic flux . This magnetic flux puts out a constant 30-50 hz, .5 milliwatt ele ctromagnetic (EMF) wave. Contained in the electroma gnetic emis- sion from the brain are spikes and patterns called \"evoked potentials.\" Every thought, reaction, motor command, auditory ev ent, and visual image in the brain has a correspond ing \"evoked potential\" or set of \"evoked potentials.\" The EMF e mission from the brain can be decoded into the curr ent thoughts, images and sounds in the subject's brain. NSA SigInt uses EMF-transmitted Brain Stimulation as a communications system to transmit information (as well as nervous system messages) to intelligence ag ents and also to transmit to the brains of covert o perations sub- jects (on a non-perceptible level). EMF Brain Stimulation works by sending a complexly coded and pulsed elec tromagnetic signal to trigger evoked potentials (events) in the brain, thereby forming s ound and visual images in the brain's neural circui ts. EMF Brain Stimulation can also change a person's brain-states and affect motor control. Two-way Electronic Brain-Link is done by remotely monitoring neural audio-visual information while transmit- ting sound to the auditory cortex (bypassing the ea rs) and transmitting faint images to the visual cor tex (bypassing the optic nerves and eyes, the images appear as flo ating 2-D screens in the brain)."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4 Two-Way Electronic Brain Link has become the ultimate communications system for C IA/NSA personnel. Remo- te Neural Monitoring (RNM, remotely monitoring bioe lectric information in the human brain) has become the ulti- mate surveillance system. It is used by a limited n umber of agents in the U.S. Intelligence Community. RNM requires decoding the resonance frequency of ea ch specific brain area. That frequency is then modu lated in order to impose information in That specific brain area. The frequency to which the various brain area s respond varies from 3 Hz to 50 Hz. Only NSA Signals Intelli gence modulates signals in this frequency band. An example of EMF Brain Stimulation: Brain Area Bioelectric Resonance Frequency Information Induced Through Modulation Motor Control Cortex 10 HZ Motor Impulse Co-ordin ation Auditory Cortex 15 HZ Sound which bypasses the ea rs Visual Cortex 25 HZ Images in the brain, bypassin g the eyes Somatosensory Cortex 09 HZ Phantom Touch Sense Thought Center 20 HZ Imposed Subconscious Thought s This modulated information can be put into the brai n at varying intensities from subliminal to percept ible. Each person's brain has a unique set of bioelectric resonance/entrainment frequencies. Sending audio i nformation to a person's brain at the frequency of another person 's auditory cortex would result in that audio infor mation not being perceived. The Plaintiff learned of RNM by being in two-way RN M contact with the Kinnecome group at the NSA, Ft. Meade. They used RNM 3D sound direct to the brain to haras s the Plaintiff from 10/90 to 5/91. As of 5/91 they have had two-way RNM communications with the Plaintiff and h ave used RNM to attempt to incapacitate the Plainti ff and hinder the Plaintiff from going to authorities abou t their activities against the Plaintiff in the las t twelve years. The Kinnecome group has about 100 persons working 2 4-hours-a-day at Ft Meade. They have also brain-tap ped persons the Plaintiff is in contact with to keep th e Plaintiff isolated. This is the first time ever t hat a private citizen has been harassed with RNM and has been able to bri ng a lawsuit against NSA personnel misusing this in telligence operations method.
