Revision 1B - 30 July 2019 TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 2: Conclusions Chapter 3: References Abstract Rev 1B - This short ebook describes the massive fraud that is happening at AT&T, under the leadership of Randall L. Stephenson, CEO. One of the primary beneficiaries of this fraud is the Blackrock Corporation under Larry Fink, that owns $14 billion in shares of AT&T, which is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"one of the largest cell phone operators in the world. AT&T has allowed their cell towers, equipment, and antennas to be used as part of a weapon system against Targeted Individuals in the United States. The technology that creates a microwave beam and can be directed at someone – is called, digital beam forming. Targeted Individuals will inform you that it can be excruciatingly painful and constitutes torture on a daily basis. AT&T is one of the cell phone operators that are participating in these acts of Treason against U.S. civilians. Treason is defined under U.S. law and is punishable by the death penalty. - - 18 U.S. Code § 2381; Treason. - 18 U.S. Code § 2382; Misprision of Treason. - - 18 U.S. Code § 2340; (c) Conspiracy to commit torture. The AT&T antenna system can also be used to direct subliminal messages at anyone, 24 hours/day. The main system involving satellites and cell towers is controlled from Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado. AT&T executives are aware of the program and the use of their antennas. Randall Stephenson and Larry Fink at Blackrock, are both members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). At Targeted Justice, we have received emails indicating that a large, well-organized gangstalking campaign exists within AT&T – supposedly to enforce a system of silence and secrecy. Home addresses and the names of relatives are provided, for some of these corporate executives. This is not doxxing. This information was obtained from public sources that have been available for more than 10 years. Anyone can obtain this information. Introduction Randall L. Stephenson is the CEO of AT&T Corporation. Larry Fink is the CEO of Blackrock Corporation, the largest asset management firm in the world. Both are members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). They have both greatly benefitted recently, from a fraudulent government contract to provide a first-responder network called FirstNet.com AT&T received a government contract worth $6.5 billion. This massive fraud is in addition to, the already serious federal crimes that are occurring at AT&T. This includes willfully participating in the Directed Energy Weapon system used by the Air Force Space Command in Colorado at Schriever Air Force Base. This is an Unacknowledged Special Access Program, called the Targeted Individual program. It is funded by the CIA from their domestic headquarters in Denver."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Figure 1.

Akard Street Dallas, Texas 75202 210-821-4105 Mr Stephenson, After significant research, TargetedJustice.com has determined that AT&T Corporation is involved in the Targeted Individual Program, which includes using Directed Energy Weapons to track and attack United States civilians. These actions are clearly defined as Treason or Misprision of Treason. In particular, your company's antennas are using digital beam forming as a weapon, to attack civilians. 1) Any electrical engineer can surmise that the electrical power consumption on a cell tower, significantly exceeds what is required to deliver phone calls, text messages, and internet access. The large spikes in power consumption are used to feed the digital beam weapon system. 2) Tower technicians are routinely told not to use a signal analyzer near the tower antennas. (because this would reveal the high power signals that are being used as a beam weapon) 3) Recall the 2006 lawsuit with AT&T technician Mark Klein, who provided details about the level of corruption and collusion between the NSA and AT&T. 4) The $6.5 billion dollar FirstNet system being built by AT&T, is actually payment/part of the tracking and targeting system that will be used against Targeted Individuals. (FirstNet.com) The average cell tower costs $175,000. This means that AT&T has been paid enough money to build more than 37,000 cell towers, nationwide, on average. That represents more towers than any cell phone operator currently holds. And yet the FirstNet system is already operational, without installing many new towers. Where did the money go? And what was the payment really for? Clearly, the numbers and cost do not make sense. AT&T has misrepresented the work they would do during this government contract (fraudulent misrepresentation under the False Claims Act). They have also obtained exaggerated profits under a government contract. In general, maximum profit on a government contract is 10% to 15%, according to U.S. law – Federal Acquisition Regulations. FAR 15.404-4. The undersigned represent the interests of more than 2,000 Targeted Individuals (\"Non- Investigative Subjects\"). We demand an explanation for these activities and compensation for pain, suffering, and illegal torture. A similar letter has been sent to the Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs. We demand that you immediately CEASE AND DESIST your illegal activities, including the support of U.S. government agents using these tracking systems, providing training or technical support, or providing upgrades or modifications to the systems which are being used to track or attack civilians. Such actions are in violation of Article 32 of the Geneva Conventions and numerous Federal & State laws. In the United States, your continued actions constitute High Treason."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"This CEASE AND DESIST Demand is to inform you that your conspiracy to commit torture and Crimes against Humanity are illegal, and will not be tolerated. We demand that you immediately CEASE AND DESIST. Should you continue to pursue these activities in violation of this CEASE AND DESIST Demand, we will not hesitate to pursue further legal action against you. You may have already violated numerous Federal laws, including: - 18 U.S. Code § 2381; Treason. - 18 U.S. Code § 2340; (c) Conspiracy to commit torture. - 18 U.S. Code § 2382; Misprision of Treason. - 18 U.S. Code § 2384; Seditious Conspiracy. - 18 U.S. Code § 2389; Recruiting for service against the United States. - 18 U.S. Code § 241; Conspiracy to Deprive Constitutional Rights. - 18 U.S. Code § 242; Deprivation of Constitutional Rights. - 18 U.S. Code § 1961; Organized Crime Control Act of 1980.

Readers are advised that the NSA may be blocking or restricting access to some of my ebooks, especially outside the United States. Readers are further advised that digital tracking tags may have been placed in my ebooks. It may be best to download from Apple iBooks, if possible. Note how slowly the jpg's load into the ebook when viewing. The content of some ebooks may have been altered – still trying to monitor this. If you have tried to contact me, it is possible that emails and phone calls are being blocked (RLighthouse – at – protonmail.com) The government criminals latest hacking efforts include hiding information within the Page Break character. I am unable to delete these new page lines. Other times, tracking tags or codes are hidden within the images. I suggest - print the document out at low resolution, and then share as a paper copy for distribution. For more than 6 years, this author has been stalked, harassed, and threatened by US Government agents from the CIA, FBI, and NSA - because of the content of my writings. My home has been broken into, repeatedly. In May 2014, my girlfriend was drugged and kidnapped from LaGuardia airport. She was unconscious for more than 4 hours. This is not a joke. My computer, phone, and alarm system have been hacked, including those of my friends and family. It is truly sad and pathetic, these agencies have become criminal organizations. If something happens to me (disappearance, false criminal charges, sudden accident, etc) - my readers can be certain that the CIA and FBI were involved. I would never deliberately harm myself, it is against my beliefs. In my opinion, the CIA and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) are directing these criminal acts; David Rubenstein is the Chairman. Gina Haspel is the current Director of the CIA. As a long-term employee of the CIA, it is certain that she knows about the Targeted Individual Program and the Gangstalking Program. “The CIA and FBI are behind most, if not all terrorism.” - Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief Figure 14.
