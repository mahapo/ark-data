This short ebook provides the author's opinions and evidence of the War Crimes and Treason that are occurring at the USAF Space Command. The USAF has repeatedly violated the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. The Linkedin accounts of two Air Force officers are provided showing the admission of 9 satellite weapons systems in space, including testing new weapons systems. Article IV of the treaty prohibits the stationing or placement “in orbit around the earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction.” A simplified organizational chart showing the Squadrons that are involved with the daily operations and some of the internal structure. Many officers are involved in the daily decisions to target civilians with military weapons. The daily task orders are reviewed and approved by numerous officers in command. These military monsters know exactly what they are doing. There are far too many logistical, support, and authorization issues for it to be hidden. There are, at least, 7 satellite constellations and 9 weapons systems available to the Space Operations Squadrons (SOPS), under the 50 th Space Wing at Schriever Air Force Base. There are 3 main Operational Squadrons, and 2 Air Force Reserve squadrons, including about 1,300 operations personnel. We know this from the web site at Schriever.af.mil, and from the public information provided by the resumes of Air Force personnel on social media sites. Also explained, is how the Air Force uses certain terminology to hide what they are doing, such as referring to weapons as “payloads.” Images from Schriever.af.mil are provided showing that defense department weather satellites (DMSP) have an entire cadre of officers that are responsible for “Weapons & Tactics” - yes, even for a weather satellite. Clearly, there are military weapons attached to the satellites. The Infrared Laser used by the USAF on 9-11 was clearly a weapon of mass destruction, as it killed 3000 people. See my ebook “Technical Description of the Infrared Laser Used on the WTC 9-11.” Also reference DrJudyWood.com which provides the extensive and compelling photographic and video proof. Figure 63 at this link clearly shows the “cookie-cutter” laser holes that are 30 feet in diameter. http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam4.html This Infrared Laser (Directed Energy Weapon) was operated and controlled from Schriever Air Force Base.

It causes"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"biological and chemical damage in humans, and can destroy human-made structures, such as buildings. The USAF and the CIA violate Article 32 of the Geneva Convention, using civilians for scientific or medical experiments, and torture. It is an Unacknowledged Special Access Program (USAP). It is a serious International Treaty Violation. It is Unconstitutional. It is a War Crime, that is punishable by the death penalty. Introduction The 1967 Outer Space Treaty has been signed by 91 countries, including the United States. Unfortunately, the United States has violated the treaty, repeatedly. 18 U.S. Code § 2332a - Use of weapons of mass destruction United States criminal law defines; the term “weapon of mass destruction” means— (A) any destructive device as defined in section 921 of this title; (B) any weapon that is designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the release, dissemination, or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals, or their precursors; (C) any weapon involving a biological agent, toxin, or vector (as those terms are defined in section 178 of this title); or (D) any weapon that is designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life; and (3) the term “property” includes all real and personal property. The Titan Corporation's Vircator satellite microwave weapon consumes 32 Megajoules of energy when fired at full power. It releases electromagnetic radiation at a level that is dangerous to human life. 32 Megajoules of energy is far more energy than most explosive bombs, and the weapon can be fired continuously. It is a “destructive device” according to any definition. A Vircator microwave weapon releases significant EMF radiation that can kill or cause serious bodily injury. In 2017, Dr John Hall, M.D. was hit repeatedly in the heart with these microwave weapons until it gave him a heart attack. According to his friends, the open heart surgery discovered 2 circular burn marks on his heart. These weapons are mounted in space on numerous satellites. They also cause chemical and biological damage to human life. The entire global system attacks more than 1 million people, continuously everyday. It is clear that these microwave weapons meet the definition for a weapon of mass destruction. These are the Articles that the United States is violating: Article II states that, “Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.” This is contradicted by the statements of Dr Bill Deagle, M.D. The"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"General and Base Commander at Schriever Air Force Base makes it clear that the United States controls all of outer space between the Earth and Mars. This is a violation of Article 2. Article III specifically requires that all states carry on activities in outer space in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. The United States has violated this Article many times, by attacking civilians with space-based weapons. Article IV provides that states may not place in orbit, “any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction.” The United States has been placing these microwave weapons in orbit since, at least 1987, and possibly earlier. Article VII specifically provides that any state that launches an object into orbit is internationally liable for any damage that is caused by the object in space, to another state party, or to its natural or juridical persons. The United States has repeatedly violated this Article. The USAF Space Command at Schriever Air Force Base, near Colorado Springs, has used satellite-based microwave weapons to attack civilians all over the world. TargetedJustice.com estimates the number exceeds 1 million people on a daily basis. Article IX clearly provides that any state must “undertake appropriate international consultation before proceeding with any activity or experiment” that could cause potential harm. The United States has clearly violated this Article many times. Article XI requires that the United States inform the Secretary General of the United Nations that their activities in space include satellite payloads with 9 different weapons systems. The United States has violated this Article many times. What is a “weapon of mass destruction?” According to one definition. a “weapon of mass destruction” is a nuclear, radiological, chemical, or biological weapon that can kill or bring significant harm to a large number humans or cause great damage to human-made structures (i.e., buildings) , natural structures, or the biosphere. A “conventional weapon” is defined as a weapon that uses kinetic and explosive energy to cause damage. An electromagnetic weapon cannot be considered “conventional” by any definition. Also, given that the intent of the weapon is to torture and damage biological cells and cause chemical damage in the brain and body – it clearly falls under the definition of a weapon of mass destruction. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's definition of a weapon of mass destruction is different: - any \"destructive device\" as defined in Title 18 USC Section 921: any explosive, incendiary, or poison gas – bomb, grenade, rocket having a propellant charge of more than four ounces, missile having an explosive or incendiary charge of more than one-quarter ounce, mine, or device similar to any of the devices described in the preceding clauses - any weapon designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury through the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"release, dissemination, or impact of toxic or poisonous chemicals or their precursors - any weapon involving a disease organism - any weapon designed to release radiation or radioactivity at a level dangerous to human life - any device or weapon designed or intended to cause death or serious bodily injury by causing a malfunction of or destruction of an aircraft or other vehicle that carries humans or of an aircraft or other vehicle whose malfunction or destruction may cause said aircraft or other vehicle to cause death or serious bodily injury to humans who may be within range of the vector in its course of travel or the travel of its debris. The FBI has obtained convictions for the possession and use of WMD such as pipe bombs, truck bombs, shoe bombs, and cactus needles coated with a biological toxin. If a cactus needle is a weapon of mass destruction, then we can easily conclude that a 32 megajoule microwave weapon, targeting more than 1 million people – is a weapon of mass destruction. Dr Bill Deagle, M.D. worked at the underground facilities at Schriever Air Force Base and was informed by an Air Force General, that the United States has troops stationed in outer space – this is a violation of the Treaty. Further, the General claimed that the United States already controls all of outer space between Earth and Mars. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzzKACyw7jc Figure 1.

As previously noted in my ebooks, the satellite tracking frequencies have been scientifically measured at 3600 MHz - 3750 MHz, and the attack frequencies for the Vircators are 3920 MHz – 3935 MHz. These frequencies are confirmed by the FCC frequency allocation table, as being satellite-to-ground signals. See my ebook “Targeted Individuals: Technical Information” Figure 2.

One of the Satellite Control Rooms at Air Force Space Command, Peterson Air Force Base. So this is how it works: There are hundreds of microwave weapons installed on satellites as “payloads”. The Space Duty Orders come from the 50 th Operational Support Squadron (OSS). This Squadron determines which satellites are available for duty assignments for each day. Some of the satellites will have problems each day, such as malfunctioning software, solar panel problems, software upgrades, etc. This Squadron informs the other units which satellites & weapons are available that day. Some of the satellites are assigned to run the pre-programmed attacks, and some satellites are available for manual attacks. There are about 1,300 personnel that are targeting more than 1 million people worldwide – so clearly the bulk of the attacks are done using pre- programmed software directing the satellites. That information is reviewed and approved by the chain of command, that includes many officers. Each one of these officers is willingly and knowingly, participating in a War Crime. According to Dr Bill Deagle, MD, the computer complex underground at Schriever Air Force Base has “more computing power than the entire rest of the world combined, by a large order of magnitude.”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The 22 nd Space Operations Squadron (SOPS) issues the Daily Task Orders to the 4 Operational Squadrons. This is the list of specific people or equipment that are to be targeted with weapons, using manual and pre-programmed attacks. This information is reviewed and approved by the chain of command that includes many officers. The USAF personnel are knowingly using military weapons to attack civilians located within the United States. This is the definition of Treason. It is also a War Crime under Article 32 of the Geneva Convention. It is also defined as a Crime Against Humanity in the International Criminal Court... (“systematic attacks against a civilian population”). The 1 st Space Operations Squadron is assigned those tasks that include manual attacks using their specific satellites, such as the ORS satellites, which are likely the satellites that have a flash xray system. The assignments are reviewed and approved by the chain of command at 1 st SOPS, which includes many Air Force and CIA officers. The 2 nd Space Operations Squadron is assigned those task that involve the weapons on the NavStar satellites. These are probably Vircator-type weapons. The 3 rd Space Operations Squadron was merged with the 4 th SOPS in 2017. The 4 th Space Operations Squadron is assigned those tasks that include manual attacks using their specific satellites, including WGS and AEHF. The assignments are reviewed and approved by the chain of command at 4 th SOPS, which includes many officers. The 6 th SOPS is an Air Force Reserve unit. They are involved with weather satellites (DMSP), which also carry weapons (see Figure 9). These satellites are also operated by NOAA, but these government employees are completely unaware the satellite is carrying military weapons. It should be abundantly clear that many officers in the chain of command have full knowledge and review/approve attacks on a daily basis. This cannot be denied by these military monsters. Each day, they are committing War Crimes against civilians. Each day, they are violating their sworn oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Figure 6. USAF Space Command Organizational Chart (simplified). In his video, Dr Bill Deagle mentioned the Iridium satellites being operated from Schriever, but this author has yet to identify which Squadron is responsible. The authority for the organization starts at the top, but the structure functions from the bottom. Each morning, the 50 th OSS provides a list of satellites to the organization that are available for duty. This is necessary because some of the satellites are down for maintenance or troubleshooting. Next, the 22 nd SOPS sends out the Daily Tasking Orders that state who will be attacked manually and who will be attacked using automatic pre-programming. The CIA's Denver Domestic Operations Headquarters are involved in these decisions, because their PsyOps group has specific instructions for specific individuals. This is done because most of the attacks are pre-programmed. We can deduce this because there are more than 1 million Targeted Individuals and only 1,300 people in Operations that can control the satellites manually. The targeting information is reviewed and approved by the chain of command that includes many officers. Dr Bill Deagle specifically mentions the Iridium satellite program as being controlled thru Schriever AFB, but we do not know which Squadron is operating it. The Airmen that operate the satellites do not know the name of Targeted Individuals. They only see a code or GPS coordinates that corresponds to your name on the Terror Watchlist. The Airmen have been informed that you are “bad person” and that is why your name is on the Terror Watchlist. They can see that your GPS coordinates puts you in the United States. They know you are a civilian located in the U.S. They can also conclude that what they are doing is grossly illegal, a violation of the U.S. Constitution, and International Treaties."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Before any USAF personnel are allowed to fire the satellite weapon, they must attend “Mission Qualification Training” school. This is the classroom program where they are told that people's names appear on the Terror Watchlist and that they will be hitting them with military weapons. They are told it is an “Unacknowledged Special Access Program (USAP)” and that they are never to tell anyone what they do. Not even the President of the United States knows about this program. It is disturbing that young recruits in the USAF completely accept this explanation and disregard everything they learned about civil rights and human rights. USAP's are illegal. Their very existence is a violation of the U.S. Constitution. If the President and Congress do not know that the program exists – then it is illegal. No Air Force personnel can be charged with a crime for exposing an illegal program. Dr Steven Greer explains this in his important documentary film, “Unacknowledged.” It is likely that the high suicide rate in Colorado Springs is actually a murder rate – some of these people are likely USAF personnel that tried to blow the whistle on these criminal activities.

This has been apparent for many years. It is this author's opinion that many of these suicides are murders, staged suicides, and this is how the military keeps their War Crimes as a secret. USAF Space Command has 51 news articles which mention suicide. Schriever AFB has 73 news articles which mention suicide. Peterson AFB has more than 200 news articles mentioning suicide, (but it seems to be a standard page link) http://www.airforcemedicine.af.mil/SuicidePrevention/ www.peterson.af.mil/News/Photos/igphoto/2001634833/ According to Defense Department statistics, 266 active duty service members and 209 reserves and National Guardsmen committed suicide in 2015 ... “To combat something as complicated as suicide, we need leaders at every level involved,” said Lt. Col. Alicia Matteson, the Air Force suicide prevention program manager. “We need the front line supervisors, all the way up to squadron, group and wing commanders involved and being connected to their airmen.” If suddenly someone comes in and they're looking exhausted, or they exhibit signs of depression or mood swings, then ask,” said Dr. Jeffrey Greenberg with the Air Force Suicide Prevention Program.
