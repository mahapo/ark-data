There are far too many logistical, support, and authorization issues for it to be hidden. There are 7 satellite constellations and 9 weapons systems available to the Space Operations Squadrons (SOPS), under the 50 th Space Wing at Schriever Air Force Base. The re ar e 3 main Operational Squadrons, and 2 Reserve squadrons. We know this from the web site at Schriever.af.mil, and from the public information provided by the resumes of Air Force personnel on social media sites. Also explained, is how the Air Fo rce u ses certain terminology to hide what they are doing. Images from Schriever.af.mil are provided showing that defense department weather satellites have an entire cadre of officers that are responsible for “Weapons & Tactics” - yes, for a weather sate llite . Clearly, there are military weapons attached to the satellites. The 1968 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space. The United States has violated this treaty, repeatedly. The Infrared Laser used by the U SAF o n 9 - 11 was clearly a weapon of mass destruction. See my ebook “Technical Description of the Infrared Laser Used on the WTC 9 - 11.” Also reference DrJudyWood.com which provides the proof. This Infrared Laser (Directed Energy Weapon) was operated and contr olled from Schriever Air Force Base. Also, the satellite constellations that attack more than 1 million civilians everyday – are weapons of mass destruction. They violate Article 32 of the Geneva Convention s , using civilians for scientific or medical exper iments, and torture. Introduction The 1968 Outer Space Treaty has been signed by more than 100 countries, including the United States. Unfortunately, the United States has violated the treaty, repeatedly. This has been documented by Dr Bill Deagl e, M .D. in July 1994. He personally worked at the underground facilities at Schriever Air Force Base and was informed by a Senior Base Commander that the United States has troops stationed in outer space – this is a violation of the Treaty. Further, the Comm ander claimed that the United States already controls all of outer space between Earth and Mars. This is a nother Treaty violation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzzKACyw7jc "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Figure 1. Dr Bil l Deagle, M.D. - experiences at Schriever AFB. The Air Force Space Command has about 38,000 employees, based at many locations, and has its headquarters in Colorado Springs at Peterson Air Force Base. As previously noted in my ebooks, the satellite tra cking frequencies have been scientifically measured at 3600 MHz - 3750 MHz, and the attack frequencies for the Vircators are 3920 MHz – 3935 MHz. These frequencies are confirmed by the FCC frequency allocation table. See my ebook “Targeted Individuals : T echnical Information” Figure 2. Headquarters - Air Force Space Command, Peterson Air Force Base. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Figure 3. One of the Satellite Control Rooms (possibly a training center) at Air Force Space Command, Peterson Air Force Base. So , this is how it works: There are hundreds of mic ro wave weapons installed on satellites as “payloads”. The Space Duty Orders come from the 50 th Operational Support Squadron (OSS). This Squadron determines which satellites are available for duty assignments for e ach day. Some of the satellites w ill have problems each day, such as malfunctioning software, solar panel problems, software upgrades, etc. This Squadron informs the other units which satellites & weapons are available that day. Some of the satellites are assigned to run the pre - progr ammed attacks, and some satellites are available for manual attacks. There are about 1,300 personnel that are targeting more than 1 million people worldwide – so clearly the bulk of the attacks are done using pre - programme d software directing the satellite s. That information is reviewed and approved by the chain of command, that includes many officers. According to Dr Bill Deagle, MD, the computer complex at Schriever Air Force Base has more"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"computing power than the entir e rest of the world combined, by a large order of magnitude. The 22 nd Space Operations Squadron (SOPS) issues the Daily Task Orders to the 4 Operational Squadrons. This is the list of specific people or equipment that are to be targeted with weapons tha t day . This information is reviewed and approved by the chain of command that includes many officers. The USAF personnel are knowingly using military weapons to attack civilians located within the United States. This is the definition of Treason. It is also a War Crime under Article 32 of the Geneva Convention. It is also defined as a Crime Against Humanity in the International Criminal Court (“systematic attacks against a civilian population”). The 1 st Space Operations Squadron is assigned those tas ks that include manual attacks using their specific satellites, such as ORS - 1, which is likely the satellite that has a flash xray system – this one of the 9 weapon systems . The assignments are reviewed and approved by the chain of command at 1 st SOPS, which includes many Air Force and CIA officers. The 2 nd Space Operations Squadron is assigned those task that involve the tracking and weapons on the NavStar GPS satellites. Some of t hese are probably Vircator weapons. The 3 rd Space Operations Squadron was merged with the 4 th SOPS in 2017. The 4 th Space Operation s Squadron is assigned those tasks that include manual attacks using specific satellites, including WGS and AEHF. The assignments are reviewed and approved by the chain of command at 4 th SOPS, which includes many officers. The 6 th SOPS is an Air F orce Reserve unit. They are involved with weather satellites (DMSP), which also carry weapons (see Figure 5 ). These satellites are also operated by NOAA, but I would guess that the NOAA government e mployees are completely unaware the satellite is carrying military weapons. I t should be abundantly clear that many officers in the chain of command have full knowledge and review/approve attacks on a daily basis. This cannot be denied by these military monsters. Each day, they are committing War Crimes against civilians. Each d ay, they are violating their sworn oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Figure 4. USAF Space Command Organizational Chart (simplified) This do es not show many of the details of the entire 50 th S pace Wing. The authority for the organization starts at the top, but the organizational structure functions fr om the bottom up . Each morning, the 50 th OSS provides a list of satellites to the organiz ation that is available for duty. This is necessary because some of the satellites are down for maintenance or troubleshooting. Next, the 22 nd SOPS sends out the Dai ly Tasking Orders that identify who will be attacked manually. This is done because most of the attacks are pre - programmed. We can deduce this because there are more than 1 million Targeted Individuals and only 1,300 people in Operations that can control th e satellites manually. The targeting information is reviewed and approved by the chai n of command that includes many officers. Dr Bill Deagle , MD specifically mentions the Iridium satellite program as being controlled thru Schriever AFB, but we do not know at thi s time w hich Squadron is operating it – it is possibly the 2 nd Squadron becau se it has a similar function as the GPS satellites . If you are a Targeted Individual, t he Airmen that operate the satellite weapon s do not know your name. They only see a code and the GPS coordinates that correspond to your name on the Terror Watchlist. The Airmen have been informed that you are “bad person” and that is why your name is on the Watchlist. They can see that your GPS coordinates puts you in the United States. They know you are a civilian located in the U.S. They can also conclude that wh at they are doing is grossly illegal, a violation of the U.S. Constitution, and Inter national Treaties. Before any USAF personnel are allowed to fire the satellite weapon, they must attend “Mission Qualification Training” school. This is the classroom pr ogram where they are told that people's names appear on the Terror Watchlist and that they will be hitting them with"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"military weapons. They are told their job is an “Unacknowledged Special Access Program (USAP)” and that they are never to tell anyone what they do. Not even the President of the United States. It is disturbing that young recruit s in the USAF completely accept this explanation and disregard everything they learned about civil rights and human rights , and the U.S. Constitution . USAP's are i llegal. Their very existence is a violation of the U.S. Constitution. If the President and Congress do not know that the program exists – then it is illegal. No Air Force person n el can be charged with a crime for exposing an illegal program. Dr Steven Greer , MD explains this in his important documentary film, “Unacknowledged.” It is likely that the high suicide rate in Col orado Springs is actually a murder rate – some of these people are USAF personnel that tried to blow the whistle on these criminal a ctivities.

The Air Force doesn't pretend that B - 52's are n ot carrying weapons. The Navy doesn't pretend that Battleships are not carrying weapons. So why would the Air Force need to hide this information ?
