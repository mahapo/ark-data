Inouye (1987) Treason at the Air Force Space Command TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 2: Conclusions"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Chapter 3: References Abstract Rev 2C - This short ebook provides the author's opinions and accuses 12 military officers of High Treason against the United States (The Dirty Dozen). The Air Force Space Command, headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, is the primary organization that is using microwave satellite technology to track and attack civilians all around the world. These civilians are known as Targeted Individuals. Many of these civilians are political activists and whistleblowers – people that the Deep State would like to silence. The family relationships of Targeted Individuals have been destroyed through the use of subliminal messaging. Their careers, and finances can be ruined. It is a conspiracy of enormous magnitude, affecting 170 thousand people, by the latest estimates. The original satellites for this illegal program were launched in the late 1980's, as part of President Reagan's Star Wars program or Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The satellites were designed to track and attack ballistic missiles. Unfortunately, the Deep State decided to put these satellites to purposes that violate international treaties and the U.S. Constitution. Do not underestimate that these actions constitute Treason against the United States and its sovereign citizens, and this is the reason that the CIA and Air Force will go to great lengths to hide this program. The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is the source of this corruption, in my opinion, where David Rockefeller was the CEO and Chairman for many years. General John W. Raymond is the current commander of this criminal enterprise. The executive officers at Peterson Air Force Base and Schriever Air Force Base are listed below. Each one of these officers swore an oath of allegiance to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” This following accusation is an opinion of this author: For aiding, abetting, or directing the use of microwave military weapons against U.S. citizens, in my opinion, these military officers are guilty of High Treason against the United States: The Dirty Dozen: 1. General David. L. Goldfein, Air Force Chief of Staff 2. Dr. Heather Ann Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force 3. General John W. Raymond 4. Major General Stephen N. Whiting 5. Major General Robert J. Skinner 6. Mr. Scott M. Anderson"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"7. Colonel Todd R. Moore 8. Colonel Eric S. Dorminey 9. Colonel John L. Doucet III 10. Colonel Jennifer L. Grant 11. Colonel Jacob E. Middleton 12. Colonel Devin R. Pepper My accusation is backed by the statements of 20 medical doctors, scientists, and former intelligence agents, that have stated these crimes are real and happening globally (see TargetedJustice.com & BiggerThanSnowden.com). Many thousands of citizens are being attacked using these satellites under the command and control of the United States Air Force. It is difficult to believe these officers are unaware of the Treason and War Crimes that are occurring under their command, or that they are not involved. There are far too many logistical, support, and authorization issues for it to be hidden from the officers. To those that feel Dr Wilson should not be on this list, I have the following: While a Congresswomen from New Mexico, Dr Wilson experienced the constant bullying and threats from the American Israeli Political Affairs Committee (AIPAC), as all Congressmen do. She is fully cognizant of this criminal organization and whom it represents. She is fully aware of the Council on Foreign Relations, which is controlled by the Rockefellers, and the international private banks that control the Federal Reserve. Make no mistake – she knows. While in Congress, she enjoyed a level of pretense, that she was unaware of the corruption and had no direct responsibility to solve it, even in contradiction to the oath that she swore. However, as an executive over the Air Force, she enjoys no such pretense. She is fully responsible for the activities and criminal acts under her leadership. I will grant her no quarter. The family names have been added to this revision so readers can appreciate that Targeted Individuals have watched their family relationships destroyed by these criminals. The best way to counter that – is to let the family members of these Air Force officers feel the shame that is so obscenely disregarded by these treasonous government criminals. As I have previously stated, Air Force Space Command tracks every active satellite in orbit- about 1,400 satellites. They know who launched it and they know what signals it transmits. So, if the Air Force wants to pretend they don't know the source of these microwave attack signals, then they can easily provide the information about the country and organization that is doing this. No other organization in the world has this information. Name them and shame them. Introduction The Air Force Space Command has about 38,000 employees, based at many locations, and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"has its headquarters in Colorado Springs at Peterson Air Force Base. As previously noted in my ebooks, the satellite tracking frequencies have been scientifically measured at 3600 MHz - 3750 MHz, and the attack frequencies are 3920 MHz – 3935 MHz. These frequencies are confirmed by the FCC frequency allocation table. See the ebook “Targeted Individuals: Technical Information” Figure 1.

According to the Linkedin Profile of Charles Shurchay (Superintendent - Air Force Space Commoand) there are 1,300 personnel, 7 DoD Satellite constellations, and 9 weapon systems that are operated under the 50 th Operations Group. Clearly, these are not simply communications satellites. Many of these satellites are positioned in geosynchronous orbit, and are part of a network that includes communications, tracking, and attack satellites. Using the precise GPS coordinates of any Targeted Individual, the coordinates can be transferred to local cell towers or UAV drones for additional targeting. The GPS coordinates are accurate to +/- 0.5 centimeters or better, which allows different body parts to be targeted and attacked in a grisly, daily ordeal. Background and Supporting Information These medical doctors, scientists, and former intelligence agents have made statements supporting the evidence that microwave satellite attacks are real, and happening on a global basis.

If they deny it, perhaps the Air Force would like to tell us, who is responsible for the microwave satellites? NORAD and NORTHCOM are responsible for tracking all aerial and orbital objects that may be a threat to the United States. They have headquarters located on Peterson Air Force Base . They are fully aware of everything that is in earth orbit and they know what each satellite is doing. Clearly, the Air Force knows, and the Air Force Space Command has responsibility. “The Cheyenne Mountain Complex is located at Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station (CMAFS), a short distance from NORAD and USNORTHCOM headquarters at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

The U.S. Air Force is fully aware of every satellite in earth orbit – especially those in geosynchronous orbit. They know who launched it, and they know what each satellite does. “USSTRATCOM's (part of the Air Force budget) space control mission includes: surveillance of space, protection of U.S. and friendly space systems, prevention of an adversary's ability to use space systems and services for purposes hostile to US national security interests, and direct support to battle management, command, control, communications, and intelligence. The space control mission is conducted by USSTRATCOM's Joint Functional Component Command for Space (JFCC Space). JFCC Space, through its Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), detects, tracks, and identifies all artificial objects in Earth orbit. The JSpOC is a synergistic command and control weapon system focused on planning and executing USSTRATCOM's JFCC Space mission. Its purpose is to provide a focal point for the operational employment of worldwide joint space forces, and enable the Commander, JFCC Space (CDR JFCC SPACE) to integrate space power into global military operations.

Peterson AFB has more than 10,300 employees and tracks more than 23,000 objects in orbit. There are about 449 satellites in geosynchronous orbit – some of these are the microwave attack satellites. Clearly, the Air Force knows about the satellites, even if they deny their involvment. Www.wrpinfo.org From wikipedia.org: “The United States Space Surveillance Network detects, tracks, catalogs and identifies artificial objects orbiting Earth, e.g. active/inactive satellites, spent rocket bodies, or fragmentation debris. The system is the responsibility of the Joint Functional Component Command for Space, part of the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). Space surveillance accomplishes the following: - Predict when and where a decaying space object will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere; - Prevent a returning space object, which to radar looks like a missile, from triggering a false alarm in missile-attack warning sensors of the U.S. and other countries; - Chart the present position of space objects and plot their anticipated orbital paths; - Detect new man-made objects in space; - Correctly map objects travelling in the Earth's orbit; - Produce a running catalog of man-made space objects; - Determine which country owns a re-entering space object;"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"- Inform NASA whether or not objects may interfere with satellites and International Space Station orbits. The SPACETRACK program represents a worldwide Space Surveillance Network (SSN) of dedicated, collateral, and contributing electro-optical, passive radio frequency (RF) and radar sensors. The SSN is tasked to provide space object cataloging and identification, satellite attack warning, timely notification to U.S. forces of satellite fly-over, space treaty monitoring, and scientific and technical intelligence gathering. The continued increase in satellite and orbital debris populations, as well as the increasing diversity in launch trajectories, non- standard orbits, and geosynchronous altitudes, necessitates continued modernization of the SSN to meet existing and future requirements and ensure their cost-effective supportability.” Pictures of Each Officer: The Dirty Dozen or The Treasonous Twelve 1.

Do you find it odd or unusual that a civilian has been placed inside the senior Air Force chain of command, yet he has access to all of the material of the senior officers?

The CIA provides a significant amount of the budget for the illegal and unconstitutional programs at the Air Force Space Command. The Targeted Individuals program is owned by the CIA. The way they control the money, is by controlling the CFO. And they can't do that, if he reports through the regular chain of Air Force command as an Air Force officer. In my opinion, Scott's loyalty is to the CIA, not the Air Force. He is a CIA Officer that is positioned in the organization to watch the CIA's money. This is additional proof of the criminal conspiracy in this organization, and the lengths that the CIA will go, to cover it up. Figure 14. Colonel Todd R. Moore Last known address: Todd R.

There is no failure greater than a failed oath of office. They do not deserve the protections of the U.S. Constitution, which they have abandoned. If these officers believe my accusations have no merit, then they will not be bothered by them. Keep in mind that the facilities on Peterson Air Force Base track nearly every object in Earth orbit. If these satellites belonged to any another government, then the Air Force would know about it. They simply cannot deny their knowledge, involvement and responsibility for the microwave satellites. In my opinion, the next steps of the Air Force will be to deny responsibility, re-assign most of these officers, and try to delete all information on the internet. The Deep State will decide it is best to bury the evidence by forming a new “Space Command” as a separate military division of the U.S. Government. No one will be fooled after reading this document.
