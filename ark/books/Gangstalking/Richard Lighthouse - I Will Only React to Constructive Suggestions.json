Targeted Individuals can regain their power by using this self-hypnosis statement many times each day, until it becomes part of their core beliefs. It will effectively block negative external influences. About 20% of the population is immune to personality modification. The reasons for this are not fully understood, but some people appear to have a natural blocking mechanism in their core personality that prevents tampering from the outside. The average person can adopt this blocking capability by using a self-hypnosis procedure. Therefore, a person's best defense against subliminal messaging programs is a statement similar to; “I will only react to constructive suggestions.” It can be repeated at bedtime, or during meditative periods during the day. It is extremely effective. Although it cannot stop microwave attacks, it can prevent the personality from becoming vulnerable to alteration. This self-hypnosis statement also has other beneficial side effects. Dr Doug Rokke is a former government scientist that became a whistleblower. (BiggerThanSnowden.com). He worked on some of the CIA's illegal programs and became familiar with the procedures and equipment that were used on Targeted Individuals and their family members. Dr Rokke has identified the frequencies around 450 MHz as being used for training the brain to respond to specific subliminal messages. It can take several weeks to several months for the process, but the process can be effectively blocked by using a self-hypnosis statement. Whenever you are feeling fear, is a good time to repeat the statement. Eventually, your subconscious will hold it as a permanent belief, giving you immunity. Another alternative is to modify the statement until it feels right for you, such as, “I will only react to constructive suggestions, for all eternity.” In some people, this can offer immediate long-term benefits. Readers are suggested to modify the statement to a wording that you feel will give you permanent benefits. Trust your intuition.

Seth (Jane Roberts), Early Sessions, Session 163, 1965; “Suggestions given by an individual on any kind of a conscious basis have to be given with the cooperation of the ego. Many suggestions bypass the ego entirely. Suggestion however, as you think of it, operates both ways. This is not usually understood. Suggestions may come therefore from the physical world, to act upon the personality. Suggestions may also come from within the personality to act upon the physical environment. You can indeed to a large measure train yourself to react to constructive rather than impeding suggestions. This merely means that you will, or may to some extent, choose the direction in which action within you will move. This also implies that some part of the personality does the choosing, and is capable of distinguishing a constructive suggestion from an impeding one. And here it is necessary that we discuss more thoroughly the nature or characteristics of constructive suggestions versus impeding ones, for one may turn into the other.” 2. Seth (Jane Roberts), Early Sessions, Session 222, 1966; “...you simply need the suggestion that you will only react to constructive suggestions.” 3. Seth (Jane Roberts), Early Sessions, Session 319, 1967; “The constructive suggestions before bed are particularly important, and the request for therapeutic dreams, as these automatically relieve the morning symptoms...” Acknowledgments: The author gratefully acknowledges Seth, Jane Roberts, and Rob Butts for their significant contributions.

Dr Wood spent many years researching this and filed suit against the US Government, along with Dr Morgan Reynolds. Jet fuel does not burn through concrete and steel. The cookie-cutter holes were made by a high-powered laser that rapidly ages material - and turned the concrete and steel into dust in seconds. Note Figure 38(a) here: http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam3.html ...Watch the steel beam turn into dust while standing vertically. This laser operates at a harmonic of the blinking frequency - which causes rapid aging. Readers are also advised to see the movie \"Sirius\" by Dr Steven Greer, M.D. It is available for free on Netflix, where it is the #1 documentary, and to watch the youtube videos by the Honorable Paul Hellyer, former Canadian Minister of Defense. He has a book titled, “The Money Mafia.” Also, find my brief educational videos on youtube (Some have been blocked from the search engines). For more than 4 years, this author has been stalked, harassed, and threatened by US Government agents from the CIA, FBI, and NSA - because of the content of these ebooks. My home has been broken into, repeatedly. In May 2014, my girlfriend was drugged and kidnapped from LaGuardia airport. This is not a joke. My computer, phone, and alarm system have been hacked, including those of my friends and family. It is truly sad and pathetic, these agencies have become criminal organizations. If something happens to me (disappearance, false criminal charges, sudden accident, etc. - my readers can be certain that the FBI and CIA were involved. See my related ebooks identifying the murders of Gary Webb, Michael Hastings, Phil Schneider, William Colby, Dr Eugene Mallove, Stan Meyers, and others. In my opinion, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is behind these criminal acts; David Rockefeller was the CEO and Chairman for many years. For future reference, I would never deliberately do something that would harm or hurt myself. This goes against my beliefs and against the teachings of Seth. This needs to be stated because the CIA and FBI have proven many times that they are willing to use “staged suicides” to solve their “problems”.
