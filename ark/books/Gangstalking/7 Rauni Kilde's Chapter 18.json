GENERAL Beyond active surveillance, agents perform acts to keep the target uncomfortable , around the clock. Although operations are silently approved of, and covered for by the offic ial justice system, (they are not) seen as criminal in nature by citizens who do not have a strong sense of right and wrong. Agents must take great care that each and every act of punishment is DENIABLE . This means that should the target complain to polic e, (or) any other officials, or friends, neighbors, family members, or docWors, Whe naWXre of Whe pXnishmenW mXsW be seen as Whe WargeW¶s ³oYeracWiYe imaginaWion ́ or beWWer \\eW, an indicaWion Whe target is mentally ill ."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2 (The system) has worked for years t o recruit the medical establishment to help maintain deniability, and today, most targets (are) immediately labeled as mentally ill and often forced onto anti - psychotic medication when they complain. But their agents must still do their part skillfully (to ) perform acts of punishment, so (that) almost anyone the target complains to will deny a crime against the target has taken place. As an agent, you will be trained in how to do this. (The system) has been blessed with advanced technology which enables he avy punishment at times the target is in their home, silently, through walls, and this is very deniable. Agents must pass their initial training and demonstrate a high level of commitment to maintain community safety, and the ability to operate deniably, b efore they will be considered for advanced electronic punishment training. Electronic punishment training is beyond the scope of this manual. The organization is very fortunate in that we have been able to recruit top specialists to back up field operatio ns people.

As a community - based agent (CBA) you will have the privilege of working with a team capable of delivering beWWeU ³MXVWLce ́ WKaQ WKe RffLcLaO V\\VWeP. 2. SURVEILLANCE Surveillance is the foundation of all operations. Both community - based agent (CBA) visual surveillance and advanced electronic surveillance are used. This chapter will cover only local agent visual surveillance. Your local lead agent will schedule surveillance watches for each target in that community. Every target will have at least one CBA watching them (at) all times, even while at home and asleep. Each CBA surveillance team will be given a cell phone number for reporting target actions and movement to the local Control Center (CC). Actions to be reported include, but are n ot limited to: Target turns lights on to start the day. Target uses toilet or shower Target exits residence Target drives away Target arrives at work, or Target shops or visits any other establishment or location. Target arrives home Target eats meal, at h ome or in restaurant Target engages in sexual activity Target turns lights off at the end of the day Target turns light on in the middle of the night Target travels out of town Some of these observations will be performed by the Electronic Corps (EC), but CBA¶s shoXld attempt to make and report as many detailed observations of target activity as possible. The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3 reason such detail is necessary is that the punishment phase of active surveillance requires that supervisors customize each punishment action to matc h the personality of (the) target, and the need Wo make each pXnishmenW acWion appear Wo be ³life¶s normal breaks. ́ One important punishment function of surveillance is to sensitize the target. Targets are never told they are under surveillance or being pu nished. Instead, close, active surveillance and other acWiYiWies, happening far Wo freqXenWl\\ Wo be ZriWWen off as ³life¶s normal breaks, ́ Zill eYenWXall\\ cause the target to realize they are under surveillance and punishment. As a community - based agent (CBA), you will be given specific instruction(s) on exactly when, where, and how to carry out punishment actions. As long as you carry out punishment instructions exactly as given, there is no way the target will be believed if they complain, and you will not be exposed to risk of action by law enforcement. How well the punishment actions work depends on how accurate and complete your reports are in many situations(. The) Control Center (CC) acquires access to properties or apartments immediately next to th e WargeW¶s homes or aparWmenWs. BecaXse EC (ElecWronic Corps) has through - the - wall surveillance and punishment equipment, they will be reporting target activity along with community - based agenWs. In a W\\pical seWXp, CBA¶s ma\\ be posWed in a parked car wher e Whe WargeW¶s home or aparWmenW can be obserYed oYernighW, for e[ample. In this setup, the CBA in the car may be instructed to call, using walkie - talkie - style cell phones, another CBA (or team) waiting or patrolling by car nearby to follow the target, or, you may be assigned to follow the target yourself. You will receive instructions from your local center as to following the target. Targets in transit may be either covertly or visibly followed. When in doubt, hang back a bit, and contact the center for i nstructions, as targets in transit can present many unanticipated situations. The CenWer Zill alZa\\s haYe Whe WargeW¶s posiWion moniWored, so if a WargeW giYes Whe CBA Whe slip, it will assign other appropriate community based agents to pick up the target at the earliest opportunity. Be sure to notify (the Control Center) immediately if you lose the target. When applying the visible following of a target, making the target uncomfortable because of your presence, you will be given instructions as to when to break off the following. Another CBA or CBA team may pick up the visible following, but once you have broken away, they advise that you are clear and ready for the next assignment. 3. INTERCEPTS Intercepts are where community - based agents (CBA) will appea r Wo ³jXsW coincidenWall\\ ́ cross paths, on foot, with the target.

Your local OSS has a special means of receiving instant, silent instructions for the Center. [implants!?] 1. Intercepting CBAs may be asked to perform on e of the following forms of intercept: 2. Simple path crossing, requiring the target to take evasive action to avoid collision, multiple CBAs sometimes perform this several times during a single outing by a target. On foot, walking for an extended period o n the opposite side of the street from walking target. 3. Arriving at a place known to be a favorite of the target, and simply occupying that place just as the target is about to arrive (restaurants, parks, public facility seating, even bus seats are examp les); someWimes jXsW ³hanging oXW ́ in sXch a locaWion aW Wimes and places Zhere people don¶W ordinaril\\ do WhaW. 4. Smoking, coin - jingling, whistling, or toe - tapping near the target at a location where the target is known to need to stand, as to wait for t he bus, or standing right behind a target at a water fountain. 5. A group, as many as a dozen CBAs, may be assigned to arrive at a store just ahead of a target, and form a queue ahead of the target, spending time buying lottery tickets, to delay the target . (The target) is very tired and eager to get home after work, for example, or in a hurry. 6. Community - based agents may be assigned to leave a next door home or apartment exactly the same time as the target, repeatedly. Alternatively, a CBA may intercept the target a short way before home and arrive at exactly the same time as the target. While Whese ma\\ seem like WriYial acWs, keep in mind WhaW Whe WargeW Zill haYe Whese ³WriYial ́ things happen every single day, and repeated intercepts like these will fo rce the target to always ZaWch for sXch acWs, essenWiall\\ ensXring Whe WargeW neYer ³has a nice da\\. ́ This is Whe goal, Wo ensXre Whe WargeW¶s pXnishmenW. Similar intercept operations are performed with vehicles. The Center can schedule these every day th e target commutes, and both to and from work. Vehicle intercepts are particularly effective when the target sees the same vehicle in an intercept convoy both in the morning and in the evening commute. (Because vehicle intercepts can be dangerous, CBA assig ned to vehicle intercept duty must successfully complete a special training course prior to actual assignment.) Here are some examples of vehicle intercepts a community - based agent (CBA) can expect to be assigned. - Parking so as Wo preYenW a WargeW¶s leaY ing a parking area, and then disappearing. - Parking commercial Yehicles ofWen, near WargeW¶s home ZiWh someWhing XnXsXal aboXW Whese vehicles, such as there is no need for that trade, or just unmarked white vans to make the target think the van is there to conduct surveillance. - Simple following, or leading, a short distance, but every day. Doing this, both during target commutes and then other times makes the target very uncomfortable."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5 - Passing as side street stop sign, then stopping an uncomfortable dista nce into oncoming traffic just as target is about to arrive at the side street, causing the target to have to slam on the brakes (this requires Control Center assistance and prompting by walkie - talkie style cell phone. - For a CBA vehicle convoy, boxing in the target during a commute, forcing the target to travel at a lower speed than the target wants to travel. In some locations, the Center will supply special license plates to CBA vehicles with short words which have special meaning to the target. - For a C BA convoy, and where the target is at a location (and time) where traffic is normally very sparse, cause heavy traffic, forcing the target to notice. The ultimate vehicle intercept is the staged accident. This can be dangerous and is only assigned to very senior agents. However, it is possible to stage an accident so only the target knows it was staged. This is an excellent means of punishment where a target has committed a serious offense specifically against secret services by revealing their criminality to the public. Generally, staged accidents are done in jurisdictions where police strongly support the operations, so that the CBA driver is protected. 4. PHYSICAL SABOTAGE Physical sabotage is an especially effective form of punishment when it is careful ly limited to low value items, below the value where police will take the report seriously. For example, bXrning a WargeW¶s hoXse doZn, or eYen sWealing an e[pensiYe appliance, ZoXld bring official investigators into the picture, so that is not done. Sabo tage producing extreme safety hazards is generally not suitable for operations, because of the potential for bringing official investigators to an accident scene. So while damaging the brake s\\sWem of a WargeW¶s Yehicle is noW alloZed for commXniW\\ - based a gents (CBAs), draining some of the oil, transmission fluid or radiator antifreeze is allowed, but not all of it. The goal is to make it looks as if the target is negligent in maintaining fluid levels, and generally not causing a catastrophic failure that n on - targets might see as sabotage. It is very important to apply punishment by way of a large number of small value sabotage acts, because that makes it look like the target is forgetful, exaggerating, or in some cases even delusional, if they complain abo XW man\\ cases of small YalXe damage. The WargeW¶s associaWes will simply refuse to believe that anyone but the target is responsible. Sabotage is very important in that it lets the target know they are totally helpless to stop it, and can¶W eYen complain about it effectively without appearing mentally ill. (The) organization (is) very fortunate in that some people, hearing about sabotage from a target did the sabotage WhemselYes, ³Wo geW aWWenWion. ́ SaboWage is applied aW Whe WargeW¶s home, Zorkplace, and on their vehicle. This requires the assistance of locksmiths and alarm technicians. Your local Control Center will supply this help, and will bring specialists in from a distance in the case of rural areas. Here are some examples of sabotage a community - b ased agent (CBA) may be assigned to carry out:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"6 - Entering a vehicle, or home, and changing control and radio settings. - Replacing window washer fluid with water, possibly destroying the system in winter. - ScraWching Whe painW on Whe WargeW¶s Yehicle, scraWc hing furniture and valuables. - Tire sabotage, from removing some air right up to slashing a sidewall if authorized by the Center. - Simulating a break in electric window heater strips. - Cutting off the 4 - way flasher button. - Removing substantial amounts of oil, transmission fluid or antifreeze but not enough to cause catastrophic failure. - Moving things around inside the vehicle to show the target someone got in. - Unlocking the vehicle and leaving it unlocked, possibly even with door open. - Small cuts to car ¶s XpholsWer\\. - Unlocking Whe WargeW¶s fronW or back door and leaYing iW ajar Zhile Whe WargeW is aZa\\, eYen aW midnight at New Year for Y2 hour. - Moving furniture or carpets around fairly frequently to show the target someone was there. - Stealing low - valu e items, especially items like scissors which can be easily misplaced, keeping them until the target replaces the item, then return the missing item, often in a place the target checked. - Stealing important papers, especially those which will cost money to replace. - Stealing irreplaceable photographs. - While target is at work, remove mail from their box and toss it around. Repeatedly making wall pictures crooked. - Setting clocks to the wrong time. - Repeatedly dumping consumable supplies (e.g. coffee) to mak e the target think they are no longer capable of managing their supplies well. - Starting small rips in new clothing, which are widened on repeated visits. - Ripping croWches oXW of Whe WargeW¶s XnderZear, or sWealing finesW XnderZear, sZim sXiWs, eWc. - Repl acing clothing with similar items which are too small for the target, like for children what target does not have. - Ironing inside button flags over, making buttoning the shirt or top difficult. - Carefully working the tip of a knife through seams in any ai r mattress or cushion the target may own, including replacements, on a daily basis. - Breaking zippers in clothes and bags, perhaps by pulling out a tooth or two. - Shoving a knife through the soles of waterproof boots. - At work, removing screws from the tar geW¶s office chair, or aW home dinner Wable leaYing onl\\ one screw of four, left to tilt the table with china. - AW Zork, damaging or desWro\\ing (if noW e[Wremel\\ obYioXs) a WargeW¶s Zork from a preYioXs day, (for example), the computer is broken again poss ibly worse. - At work, replacing current copies of computer files with an older copy - particularly serious if target is a computer programmer. - At work, where some employees are or can be recruited to be community - based agents, set up ³misWaken deliYeries ́ of heaY\\ goods Zhich block Whe WargeW¶s office. - At work, if the target is responsible for parts of the operation which can be sabotaged, do so repeatedly just as the target starts eating lunch, or is about to leave for home. - At work where the target is r esponsible for maWerials (WhaW) can¶W be locked Xp, saboWage or ZiWh special permission from the Control Center steal the material.

SABOTAGING THE TARGET¶S REPUTATION SaboWaging Whe WargeW¶s repXWaWion - and all that goes with it, such as ability to earn a living, business and personal relationships - is a very special ope rations category. Newer community - based agenWs Zill noW be assigned Wo ³engineer ́ Whe meWhod, bXW Zill assisW in passing ³rXmoXrs, ́ Zhich are Whe main means of desWro\\ing a WargeW¶s pXblic image. ³RXmoXrs ́ consisW mainl\\ of lies. HoZeYer, in order Wo secX re cooperation of specific members of the community to participate in the punishment phase, additional information keyed to appeal to the patriotic or community service sense of such community members may be used as well. As mentioned earlier, the organiza tion has many top psychologists and psychiatrists on permanent staff at headquarters, and some in larger population centers. It is their responsibility to design Whe campaign Wo desWro\\ Whe WargeW¶s repXWaWion. These people listed below can be approached and given information which will cause them to make Whe WargeW¶s associaWion ZiWh Whem XncomforWable, or break off all conWacW ZiWh Whe WargeW. - Business contacts. - Supervisors. - Co - workers. - Casual social contacts, such as clubs a target may be a member o f, or a group that frequents a bar where the target is a patron. - Friends. - Local fraternal organizations - they are motivated by the public service, and are an excellent source of assistance in keeping the target under surveillance, and participating in th e punishment phase as well. - Store staffs at places the target shops. - TargeW¶s landlord. - TargeW¶s neighbors. - Tradesmen Zho are likel\\ Wo serYice Whe WargeW¶s home, car, or bXsiness. - BXs driYers on Whe WargeW¶s roXWe. - Local children. - City employees, i ncluding emergency medical technicians, ambulances. - Homeless shelter staff and residents where applicable. - Family members (surprisingly, many are ready to believe negative information.) - Especially, personnel at places the target applies for work. How i ntensely (these sabotage operations are carried out) is governed mainly by the need to prevent the target from (learning) that the negative rumors are being spread. The goal is to keep negative information covertly flowing into the community, in such a way that those receiving the informaWion aren¶W likel\\ Wo Well Whe WargeW.

The Headquarters staff have developed techniques which by and large prevent that, but those techniques are beyond the scope of this manual. Suffice it to say that it is possible to apply"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"8 ³incenWiYes ́ Zhich caXse eYen people closesW Wo Whe WargeW Wo cooperaWe. These incenWiYes are applied by specialists from our organization at higher than the local level. For the community - level CBA, the work of sabotaging the reputation of the target take s the form of simply carrying out instructions from your Control Center as to what you say to whom, how, and when. 6. DISCREDITING TARGETS While the powerful silent support of operations by the justice and psychiatric systems has been sufficient to preven t the target from informing the public, the area of discrediting targets is an ongoing acWiYiW\\. Like saboWaging Whe WargeW¶s repXWaWion, discrediWing Wheir pXblic sWaWemenWs, web sites, media appearances, letters to the editor and the like are done under the supervision of psychologists and psychiatrists on their staff. If a community - based agent (CBA) has a good track record of intelligently carrying out assignments, and has access to a computer, the CBA may apply to the local Control Center for assignmen t to discredit work. Excellent communications skills are required. Some of the activities CBAs carry out under supervision are: - Monitoring message boards, Wogs, and open media like Indy media for target posts. This is normally done in special shifts and under scheduling and control at a higher level than your local CC. This monitoring is assisted by blog scanning software which will detect and instantly flag posts relating to activities. The CBA doing this work will immediately reply with commenWs like ³S omeone isn¶W Waking Wheir medicaWion ́ or ³WargeW name ́ has proYided absolXWel\\ no eYidence. ́ The CBA Zill When reporW Whe posW Wo higher leYel sXperYisors for possibl\\ more detailed responses. - Monitoring newspapers in your area for letters to the editor regarding activities. Most editors and many reporters have been recruited and are willing to assist in keeping the important work of monitoring and neutralizing quiet, but once in a while, a letter to the editor will slip through. In this case, comments li ke ³Someone isn¶W Waking Wheir medicaWion ́ are noW an appropriaWe response. Transcribe and forward such a letter to the editor to the supervisor, along with your proposed response. The supervisor may edit your response, and will assist in ensuring your res ponse is printed. - Your supervisor will have staff monitoring upcoming talk show appearances by targets. While most talk show hosts, even those somewhat sympathetic to targets, have received discrediting information and often will not host targets, some ta rgets do manage to get on the air. In this case, your supervisor will assign you to call in to the show, and instruct you as to appropriate things to sa\\, sXch as rebXWWing Whe WargeW¶s claims, preWending Wo be a WargeW calling and making ³Zacko ́ statement s sXch as ³UFOs are harassing me, ́ or pXlling Whe discXssion aZa\\ from real acWiYiWies and Wo someWhing like ³media mind conWrol. ́ - Agents who have excellent persuasive communication skills can be assigned, with careful coaching and preparation from superv isors, to pretend to be a target and get on talk shows known to air targets as the guest. These opportunities are great ways to discredit targets by talking about UFOs, Whings like black helicopWers folloZing \\oX, foil beanies, saWelliWes ³parked ́ jXsW abo ve \\oXr home, and perhaps eYenWs normall\\ considered ³paranormal ́ like seeing (Whings WhaW) appear and disappear. These discrediting topics must be a total surprise to the host, only mentioned after the show is in progress."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"9 - CBA can ³casXall\\ ́ describe Whe ³odd behaYior ́ e[hibiWed b\\ Whe WargeW as a resXlW of aroXnd Whe clock acWiYiWies Wo Whe WargeW¶s neighbors.

TRADE - RELATED PUNISHMENT This section will give some examples of ways community - based agents (CBAs) with specific trades or situations in the community can apply deniable punishment to targets. - Underground utility crews, where the management has been recruited, schedule messy, noisy mainWenance aW Whe WargeW¶s home (or bXsiness if Whe WargeW rXns a bXsiness) . This can include having the street torn up for extended periods, or repeatedly. Fundng for unneeded work is available from headquarters. Taxi drivers can delay arriving when called by the target, especially when going to the airport. - Bus drivers have le eway, in nasty weather for example, to stop one stop away from awaiting WargeW and ZaiW Where for perhaps 5 minXWes, osWensibl\\ Wo ³geW back on schedXle. ́ This can also cause a target to miss connections with the next bus or train. This is especially effec tive when the target, exposed to bad weather, can see the bus waiting up the street for no apparent reason, or not stopping at all at your bus stop. - Repair Wrades people can keep ³geWWing iW Zrong ́ necessiWaWing man\\ recalls, be laWe, be mess\\, over - bill the target, and even damage things which were OK. This is especially effective in the automobile repair trade. - Medical lab technicians can substitute blood samples, or otherwise falsify results making the target appear to have absolutely no reason for the ir complaints. - Police can frequently pull the target over for frivolous reasons. - Telephone and cable TV technicians can re - roXWe legiWimaWe calls Wo Whe WargeW¶s nXmber in large numbers, and this will cause the target to get very angry with these totally innocent callers. - Store staff where the target shops frequently can be instructed to remove items the target is known to need when a target is known to be coming. Store management can stop ordering a WargeW¶s faYoriWe iWems. - Restaurants and food delivery services can tell the target they are out of an item known to be a favorite of a target. The key to successful punishment by trades people is that while the target is very likely to know they are being punished, these punishment acts must appear t o Whe general pXblic as ³life¶s normal breaks. ́ "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 8. TARGET¶S HOME PXnishing Whe WargeW aW Whe WargeW¶s (home) is essenWial for effecWiYeness of secreW serYice operations. If the target were punished in the community but was allowed sanctuary in their home , Whe creaWion of a ³prison ZiWhoXW Zalls ́ ZoXld noW be compleWe. One of Whe Yer\\ firsW Whings Whe ConWrol CenWer (CC) Zill arrange is for homes or aparWmenWs adjacenW Wo Whe WargeW¶s home to be occupied by both community - based agents (CBAs) and members in the Electronic Operations manual. Because operations are carried out 24/7 in shifts, homes and apartments which are leased or owned by staff are not used as dwellings. The lease or deed will bear either an entirely false name, or the name of a senior staf f member whose actual home will be at a different location. Some adjacent homes or apartments are occupied by neighbors of the target who have offered to cooperate in punishment of the target. The initial contact of neighbors to determine their willingnes s to cooperate is done by senior staff, and incentives to cooperate are often tendered. Here are some commonly used punishment activities which are carried out both by CBAs and cooperating neighbors of the target. Activities are rotated among the choices, but at least one of them is applied daily: - Noise. Noise mXsW be of a W\\pe Zhich Whe general pXblic deems ³normal. ́ Remember WhaW Whe goal is to have the target aware they are being punished, but not be able to convince anyone else that that is the case. O bserve local noise curfews, but plenty of punishment can occur outside noise curfew times. The target must not have easy cause to involve law enforcement. Examples: - Start leaf blower, times precisely when the target attempts to enjoy their yard, or when EC operators cue the CBA that the target is trying to nap. - Loud music from neighboring home. This is an excellent action, as it is common. Time it so every time the target opens a window the music starts. The timing makes the point it is intentional punis hment. EC operator can apply music in adjacent apartments with exceptionally poZerfXl bass, direcWed aW Whe WargeW¶s XniW. - FreqXenW sqXealing of Wires near WargeW¶s home. - In apartments, frequent drilling into a scrap of wood or masonry held against the t argeW¶s Zall, floors or ceiling as if ³Zorking. ́ AlWernaWiYel\\, hammering.

Today it is out of control, and a new, much bigger Stay Behind 2 is active in Norway. The Stay Behind logo resembles the NATO logo. In Italy, Stay Behind was called Gladio 2 and dealt with terrorism secretly in Western Europe. It was responsible, for example, for the kidnapping and killing of Prime Minister Aldo Moro in 1978, while the blame was pinned on the Red Brigade. Today, enemies are communists and NATO (is the) opposition. On November 22, 1990, the European Union forbade Operation Gladio, but although Norway follows most EU decisions, this one is omitted. Italy and Belgium had terror actions by Stay Behind, and when the organizations (ceased to exist, the terror operations also ceased to exist). In Norway, Stay Behind is called E14.

Friends, family members, and citizens who do not place a high value on community sometime s help targets. In these very specific cases, CC - authorized punishment in the form of individual acts against them is appropriate. The system can arrange for these target sympathizers to be found guilty of crimes, or liable for civil actions, for example.

IO ± Information W arfare - Infrasonic and ultrasonic weapons - Infrasonic and ultrasonic generators, also called emitters and VLF modulators, are weaponized devices consisting of a directional antennae dish which can send acoustic pulses to a general or specific area. In 1972 France was using infrasonic generators which operated at 7 Hz on its civilian population. By 1973, the British was using the Squawk Box in Northern Ireland. This directional weapon could target specific individuals by producing an audible sound at about 1 6Hz which turned into infrasound at 2Hz when it coupled with the ears. In early 1990s, Russia developed a 10 Hz VLF modulator adjustable up to lethal levels, capable of targeting individuals over hundreds of meters, causing pain, nausea, and vomiting. As far back as 1997, the US DOD has been creating generators in the infrasound and ultrasound ranges (7 Hz and 20 - 35 Hz, respectively) which can cause these same effects."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"17 These weapons can target the brain, causing changes in brain chemistry which influence thoughts and emotions. Particular frequencies and modulations will trigger precise chemical reactions in the brain, which produce specific emotions in the targeted individual. Infrasound - Occurs within ELF range from a few hertz up to about 20Hz, which is the lowest limit of human hearing. From 1 to 250 Hz the pain/damage threshold seems to increase with frequency as well as power. Frequency determines what kind of damage occurs whereas power determines how much damage occurs.

Infrasound is thought to be superior to ultrasound because it retains its frequency when it hits the body. From about 100 to 140 decibels infrasound causes a variety of biological symptoms. Effects include f atigue, pressure in the ears, visual blurring, drowsiness, imbalance, disorientation, vibration of internal organs, severe intestinal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Higher power levels can liquefy bowels, and resonate internal organs to death. It can also cau se feelings of pressure in the chest, choking, irregular breathing patterns and respiratory incapacitation. High powered, low frequency sound from about 30 Hz to about 100 Hz (just beyond infrasound) causes fatigue, blurred vision, bowel spasms, pain or d amage to internal organs, feelings of fullness in the chest cavity, chest wall vibration, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, choking and respiratory impairment. Psychological effects include loss of concentration, disgust, apathy, sadness, depres sion, fear, anxiety, and panic attacks.

The sounds originate from within, above, or behind the head and are transmitted to the inner ear via bone conduction (thermal expansion). (Bone conduction is another pathway for sound transmission in humans and other ma mmals). There is no external noise. It can be applied from hundreds of meters away from a target using man - portable transmitters. Dr. Allen Frey invented the technology in 1958. The transmitters use pulse - modulated waves at extremely low average power lev els. In 1975, Dr. Joseph Sharp proved that correct modulation of microwave energy can result in wireless and receiverless transmission of audible speech.

The YicWim of this psycholo gical attrition gradually becomes convinced that nothing he can do will yield a saWisfacWor\\ oXWcome Wo a siWXaWion. ́ In PO, themes are used to transmit painful stimuli (also called triggers) through all his/her channels of communication which a TA (TI) has been sensitized to. Triggers/themes are understood at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of the campaign and they are passed to various commanders of particular AO if the TA moves towards that portion of the battlespace. The triggers are part of a behavior modification program called NLP (neuro - linguistic programming) which uses anchors and triggers to promote change. An anchor is created when an emotional state is linked to something such as an object, person, sound, smell, place, color, etc. Once the anchor is established, whatever the individual was exposed to during the anchoring process becomes the stimulus (trigger) that will provoke the emotion. So basically, PO is simply a series of ³sWimXlXs - response ́ inWeracWions.

Po¶s are a planned process of conYe\\ing messages Wo a WargeW aXdience (TA) Wo promoWe cerWain attitudes, emotions, and behavior. These messages are typically convey ed using a line of persuasion known as a theme. TA (target audience) can be a group or an individual. PO involve syngergistic coordination of PsyOp, MILDEC (military deception), OPSEC (operations security), and EBO (effects - based operations). And they are in MOOTW, CMO, IW, UW, LIC operations such as counterterrorism and peacekeeping. The DOD and CFR consider PsyOp a NLW to be used on civilians.

Earl y PsyOp research was done by a small private network of think tanks, foundations, and academic institutions, which went into partnership with government agencies and kept most of the results of their studies secret. Some of the institutions that conducted these studies were known to be subversive. Thus, much of the modern PsyOp was built by a small group of private interests, using the social sciences to install a global government. Some of these are the exact same groups promoting the use of PsyOp on civil ians. RF ± Radio Frequency Weapons Rumor Campaigns - used by PsyOp units to isolate TIs.
