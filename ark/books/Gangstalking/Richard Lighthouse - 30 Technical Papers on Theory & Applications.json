And why do we perceive sequential time, where one event follows a seeming cause and effect? This short ebook describes how time actually works, and what makes it a coherent illusion. First, all of time is simultaneous. There is no backwards or forwards with time. When the universe blinks on, each cycle - all of time and space is newly constructed, with particles that did not exist one second ago. Sequential time is an illusion that has to do with the nature of perception and the ego. The massive present moment contains all of time, every second of every year, past, present, and future. When you travel thru time, you do not travel backwards or forwards. Rather, you are moving \"sideways\" across parallel timelines, that exist within the present moment. For those that want to solve the paradox, killing your grandfather in the past will not change your current reality, because for each person, there are a near-infinite number of probable timelines that exist simultaneously. #blinkinguniverse Rlighthouse.com Introduction One of my favorite quotes is from Seth, \"...you have no idea of the difficulties involved in explaining time to someone, who must take time to try and understand the explanation.” Session 14, 1964. When our universe blinks off, then the universe of antimatter blinks on. During the antimatter part of the cycle, we do not physically exist. Our consciousness exists, but not our physical bodies or the physical universe. Again, this happens more than 1 trillion times each second. You do not focus on the blank spaces, anymore than you would focus on the blank spaces in a movie reel. Keep in mind that a movie reel runs at about 30 frames per second, and you perceive a continuous moving image, but that is a illusion. Nothing is moving within a single"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"frame, as it is a stationary picture. Figure U-1. The cycle.of our blinking universe. Figure 2. Movie reel with blank spaces between the frames."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The massive present moment contains all of time, every second of every year, past, present, and future. When you travel thru time, you are moving \"sideways\" across parallel timelines, that exist within the present moment. The dinosaurs are alive and well in the present moment, and you can travel \"sideways\" thru time to meet them. That universe of 70 million years ago, exists now, in the space around you. All of these time periods are available and perceived by your subconscious mind. However, the ego filters out all of these realities, except for one – that is the one you experience. And that is the primary purpose of the ego - to keep you focused in one reality. Your ego filters out the other realities because you would be overwhelmed to directly experience the simultaneous, multidimensional universe. Our conscious awareness simply cannot handle that much input at this stage of development. As you develop your state of consciousness, you will one day be able to perceive large segments of time and many realities, simultaneously. This does not mean that you cannot do this now, because you are not fundamentally limited in any way. But we must all learn to develop and use these natural abilities. Each person has available to them, a near-infinite number of probable timelines. Every time you make a simple choice or decision, you move to a new timeline of probabilities, in our terms. In scientific terms of physical matter, there is no cause and effect, because the universe is newly constructed of new particles each time – so that the current physical “effect” cannot be connected to any previous “cause.” Your mind and consciousness are the connecting link between each blinking cycle, not any physical matter. Your mind perceives a continuous flow of events, but the physical matter is not connected between each blinking cycle. Again, this is somewhat like the frames within a movie reel. The individual movie frames have no motion within them, but you perceive continuous motion with your mind, if the frame rate is greater than about 20 frames per second. Albert Einstein's assumption that the speed of light is constant, has caused many problems in the scientific community. I won't go into the details, but I will refer interested readers to NASA scientist, Dr Daniel Gezari's important technical paper in 2009 titled, “Lunar Laser Ranging Test of the Invariance of c.” Using the latest technology and extreme precision, it is clear that the speed of light is not constant. This has huge implications for science and math. So the universe literally blinks, off and on, a trillion times each second, which is a very high frame rate in our terms. Even the latest scientific instruments have difficulty detecting this. I recently had a number of scientific people (on Linkedin.com) claim that, we cannot reside in a blinking universe at 1 trillion cycles per second, because we measure many things that blink much faster than this rate. This is a simple misunderstanding. The blinking frequency is not an upper limit for reality. We can measure and see light, for example, at a frequency of about 400 THz. I can also direct a handheld laser pointer thru the movie reel that is moving at 30 frames per second, and the light will be visible on the wall. The 30 frames per second (30 Hz)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"is not an upper limit for the laser light, otherwise we would not see any light. So the blinking frequency is not an upper limit for any perception or measurement. Another example, when you talk into a rotating fan that is turning at 100 Hz, your voice at 3000 Hz is not eliminated by the 100 HZ, as though it were an upper limit. What you hear is a stuccato of your voice, but there is no upper limit imposed by the 100 Hz. To measure the blinking frequency, we must “tune” into one of the harmonics, much like a radio dial. To understand just how fast one trillionth of one second occurs, consider this: When moving at the speed of light, in one trillionth of one second, a photon will travel less than 1 millimeter. It is about the width of 4 human hairs, or about the thickness of your small fingernail. Again, this is at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second). The approximate width of 4 human hairs, is the maximum distance that can be traveled in physical reality, within a single blinking cycle. There is no motion within a single frame of a movie reel. But within our physical universe, true motion is limited to about 0.272 millimeters. And the maximum amount of sequential time that can occur, is about one trillionth of one second. This is the true nature of time. Conclusions This short ebook has described time is a way that few scientists have ever considered. Understanding the true nature of time, is an important first step for the development of new technologies that will revolutionize our world. This document is a living document.

Blinking Universe: Alternate Mathematical Solution Abstract Rev2A -This short technical paper presents an alternate mathematical approach for determining the blinking frequency of our universe. The source for this alternate idea comes from an email sent to this author in May 2015. The source author prefers to remain anonymous. Basically, Let's think about the fundamental unit of the universe as a classical entity. The energy of such a classical entity, using the equipartition theorem, translates the number of degrees of freedom into \"units\" of k_B*T (where T is the temperature and k_B is the well-known Boltzmann constant). In this way, we find that the fundamental energy is 3*k_B*T (6 d.o.f.). We use a foundational temperature, consistent with the anthropic principle, of the freezing point (and melting point) of the essential object for existence--water. Using this temperature, we obtain a fundamental energy of ~70.6 meV. Calculation is as follows: 70.6 meV / (\\hbar \\pi^4) = 1.1 THz. Note that the \\pi^4 in general is \\pi^D, where D is the number of spacetime dimensions in existence. Each reader must comprehend that our universe is literally blinking off and on, at 1.1 trillion times every second (THz). For those unconvinced that our universe is blinking, please read “The First Periodic Table for Elementary Particles,” or “1024 Elementary Particles” which provides compelling mathematical evidence.

We only know it has something to do with blinking.\" [1] Introduction As explained in previous papers, in our terms, the universe blinks off and on at a very high frequency.[2] Due to this blinking, there is no passage of time.

Background"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Everything in a physical universe has a natural, resonant frequency – including the universe itself. That frequency is approximately 1 THz and can be utilized as a carrier wave. This can be called a vibration, a blinking, or a frequency, but perhaps a better explanation, in our terms - the entire physical universe is newly constructed and then collapses to a single point at approximately 1 trillion times each second, IN OUR TERMS (this must be emphasized). At the moment of collapse, there is no distance between galaxies - instant communication and instant travel are possible. (In larger terms, all of time is simultaneous, and there is no blinking.) This resonant frequency is named the \"Lighthouse Frequency.\" Technical The author of this alternate mathematical approach is at a major university in California and prefers to remain anonymous. I initially provided my technical paper to him, and this was his answer/comments in return. He provided this alternate solution via email in May 2015. A summary of his email follows: Let's think about the fundamental unit of the universe as a classical entity. The energy of such a classical entity, using the equipartition theorem, translates the number of degrees of freedom into \"units\" of k_B*T (where T is the temperature and k_B is the well-known Boltzmann constant). In this way, we find that the fundamental energy is 3*k_B*T (6 d.o.f.). We use a foundational temperature, consistent with the anthropic principle [2], of the freezing point (and melting point) of the essential object for existence--water. Using this temperature, we obtain a fundamental energy of ~70.6 meV, [1] Calculation is as follows: 3 * 8.62E-05 eV/K * 273.15 K = 70.614 meV and then convert this into a frequency 70.614 meV/ (hbar * pi^4) = 1.1 THz Note that the \\pi^4 in general is \\pi^D, where D is the number of spacetime dimensions in existence.

No one has ever provided mathematical evidence that unifies gravity and electromagnetism. Note that the two classical equations of Newton's Gravity and Coulomb's Law have a similar form. Also note that when Limit (r) ---> 0, these 2 equations approach a singularity This implies that our universe collapses to a single point for unification.

There are 3 mathematical approaches and 3 empirical sources that all conclude the same idea - our universe is blinking. As Einstein once said, \"Reality is merely an illusion...\" - A blinking universe would certainly make his statement correct. There is also an important mathematical distinction here. Note that I did not say these equations become infinite, nor did I state that division by zero is occurring. The two equations approach a limit, such that the difference between them becomes trivial. They become unified as they get closer to the singularity. Consider that the smallest distance that can be measured using current technology is about 10^-19 meters. Planck scale is about 10^-35 meters. Now consider these two equations at 10^ -10,000. The difference between them becomes trivial. And which equation approaches the singularity faster is immaterial. There is also a term, 1/r^2, in calculations for the strong force. This cannot be a mere coincidence. This simple math suggests that all of the fundamental forces collapse to a single point for unification. The definition for unification according to Merriam-Webster's dictionary is: the act, process, or result of unifying : the state of being unified. www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unification Clearly, this process is happening for these two equations as r approaches zero."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Some readers have criticized the issue of positive or negative charge.

ABSTRACT This short paper presents information into technology that has been used to move between two parallel universes. Described here are the possible technology characteristics of glowing orbs or balls of light, which have been photographed and filmed, all over the world and often near crop circles. By utilizing the blinking frequency of our universe, it is possible to move between universes. These orbs have been reported as glowing and/or pulsing and some appear to be 12 to 14 inches in diameter. The only unknown at present, is the exact value for the blinking frequency of our universe - the Lighthouse Frequency. Each reader must comprehend that our universe is blinking off and on, approximately 1 trillion times every second. INTRODUCTION Glowing orbs have been reported near crop circles and near Space Shuttle landing events. Many of these glowing orbs are reported as “UFOs” Some pictures:"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Recent pictures near crop circles: http://www.colinandrews.net/Orb-UFO-BEAMS-CheesefootHead.html"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Video clips may be found in the references. Note that many such videos can be found on the internet under the generic description of “UFOs”. However, a better term might be PUO – Parallel Universe Object. Proposed in this paper is the fact these objects prove the existence of Parallel Universes. So how does the technology work? Figure 1. Helicopter (or vehicle that can hover) with glass ball/camera system. The glass ball is vibrated at the blinking frequency of the universe and charged electrically to place it into a parallel universe. THE FOLLOWING IS PROPOSED: WHAT THEY SEE in their universe is a helicopter (or vehicle that can hover) with a glass ball"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"suspended beneath. The glass ball may have an ultra-thin metallic coating, such as copper (for conductivity) and contains inside a 360 degree camera with an external electric charging system to place an electric field on the glass surface. Their “helicopter” then moves in their relative space to move the glass ball in our relative space/universe. The internal camera gives them a view into our universe. The electrical charge system has very precise control of the volts and amps needed to access and maintain stability in our universe. WHAT WE SEE in our universe is a glowing ball or orb that appears to float and move around as though by intelligent control. CHARACTERISTICS The distinguishing features of such objects (PUOs) are: 1) They often “fade in” at the start and “fade out” at the end of the event. 2) They tend to be much brighter as objects versus typical UFOs. 3) Some of these may be involved with the crop circle phenomenon. The “fade in” can be attributed to adjusting the voltage and amps in their universe to obtain the precise Joules (Volt*Amp*sec) which separate the two universes. See reference [4] for more details on this. The “fade out” can be explained by their electrical source/battery system running low on energy. Remember that Einstein told us that all matter is really energy. E = mc 2 Energy can also be expressed as: E = Volts*Amp*sec The mass of the glass ball does not significantly change during the event (volts or Electrical Mass in the Electrical Universe are proportional to the mass of an object in our physical universe), however the Electrical Frequency of an object does change (Amp*sec), and this allows a calculation of the “distance” between the universes. The “distance” is proportional to the (Amp*sec) or Electrical Frequency that separates the two universes. There is no real distance (in meters) between us and them. The energy required to transit between the two universes is: [4]"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Energy = Joules = Volts * (Amp*sec) Volts = x*mass where x is a unique constant for an object (the glass ball). In our terms, the “Distance” or Range is proportional to (Amp*sec) in the Electrical Universe: D’ = Electrical Frequency = (Amp*sec) Precise control of the current and voltage is necessary for stability of the object in the target universe. Keep in mind these probable or parallel universes “overlay” each other – there is no real distance between us and them. The “distance” is measured in electrical charge.[6] It should not go without notice that these electric charges are very large and would definitely be lethal if direct contact was made with a person or helicopter in our universe. If anyone should encounter a glowing orb near the ground or close to you – DO NOT make direct contact. Keep in mind they are filming you and just want to better understand our universe – so smile, wave, or hold up a friendly sign! They do not mean harm to anyone – they are just tourists taking pictures. Watch the video links, and see if you agree?"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Figure 2. Typical hyfrecator-like device. The electrical charge must simultaneously produce the Lighthouse Frequency (or harmonic) and a precise current & voltage that will place the target object into a probable universe. The Lighthouse Frequency combined with a large electrical charge shifts the object into the target probable universe. The current and voltage must be precisely maintained to “hold” the glass ball in the other universe. A hyfrecator unit has the ability to adjust frequencies and deposit an electrical charge simultaneously. There are also industrial welding machines with high-frequency units, which could be modified for this type of application. WHAT IS THE LIGHTHOUSE FREQUENCY? All physical universes blink off and on at a very high frequency. [1], [2] Everything in the universe has a natural, resonant frequency - including the universe itself.

This resonant frequency is called the \"Lighthouse Frequency.\" It is basically the natural resonant frequency of our universe. By applying a precise electric charge to an object or vehicle (such as a spacecraft) while vibrating the external metal skin at the Resonant Frequency of the universe - a vehicle can instantly jump thru time or space.

From the perspective of the strobe, the fan is not moving and it is possible to \"jump\" between the blades. The jump, in our terms, is caused by a simple electric charge. When applying and maintaining a constant voltage, current, and phase angle while simultaneously vibrating an object at the Lighthouse Frequency, this will cause a target object to “jump” into a probable or parallel universe, in our terms.

A Vehicle for Time Travel ABSTRACT This short technical note describes an approximate mathematical solution for Time Travel involving relativity and very brief time intervals. Time Travel is made possible by exploiting the fact that our universe literally blinks, off and on, at a very high frequency. Limitations of the solution are discussed including possible error sources. Assumptions are made for small changes in the speed of light and for the Lighthouse Frequency, which has been described in previous papers. This paper will only be meaningful to those with a background in calculus, physics or engineering. The math is derived by taking Einstein's equation, E=mc^2, and taking the partial derivative with respect to time. Readers will note that the speed of light is not constant per Dr Daniel Gezari's important paper; \"Lunar Laser Ranging Test on the Invariance of C.\" Each reader must comprehend that our universe literally blinks off and on, more than 1 trillion times every second. For those unconvinced that our universe is blinking - please see the related ebook, \"The First Periodic Table for Elementary Particles,\" which provides compelling mathematical evidence. Background Information Everything in a physical universe has a natural, resonant frequency – including the universe itself. That frequency is approximately 1 THz and can be utilized as a carrier wave. [10] This can be called a vibration, a blinking, or a frequency, but perhaps a better explanation, in our terms - the entire physical universe is newly constructed and then collapses to a single point at 1 trillion times each second, IN OUR TERMS (this must be emphasized). At the moment of collapse, there is no distance between galaxies - instant communication and instant travel are possible. (In larger terms, all of time is simultaneous, and there is no blinking. ) This resonant frequency is named the \"Lighthouse Frequency.\" By applying a precise electric charge to a vehicle (such as a spacecraft) while vibrating the external metal skin at the Resonant Frequency of the universe - a vehicle can instantly jump thru time or space.

Technical Note: PART 1 Time, in our terms, is one form of Probability. To jump between probable universes will require a specific amount of Energy. Physicists are familiar with the equation from the Special Theory of Relativity: [1] E = m c 2 From this formula, we can also deduce dE = d (mc 2 ) or perhaps more accurately If we assume mathematically that the speed of light, c, can vary with time, then c is no longer a constant. And for very small intervals of time, the change in mass with respect to time can be considered negligible and this term becomes 0,"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"We assume this Energy is constantly created and never destroyed, because the physical universe blinks off and on (which is different than the Law of Energy Conservation). [4] dE = m * 2c dc If we evaluate dE over a time interval equal to a single cycle of the Lighthouse Frequency: = m * 2c dc which is a non-zero value, in contrast to the Conservation of Energy. Therefore, the amount of Energy needed to jump to a different Probable Time, is determined by the mass and the change in the speed of light between the Origin Probable Universe (Origin) and the Target Probable Universe (Target), as well as the value of the Lighthouse Frequency. Based upon the data in Reference [6] and [7], it appears that the speed of light is increasing over the last 50 years at an average value of 3.14929 m/s each year. We will assume this value is correct, however only precise laboratory and experimental testing can determine the correct values. For small changes in time and the speed of light, we will assume that it is governed by the equation: [6], [7] y = 3.14929 x where x = calendar year difference in decimal format (i.e. 50 years) and y is equal to dc. So for a time translation of 50 years, we get approx. dc = 157.4645 m/s (After preliminary hardware testing using target objects, it will be possible to better define the equation. It is likely non-linear for large changes.)"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"So, in our terms, the Energy required depends on the value of the Lighthouse Frequency, the mass, and the change in the speed of light.

We know from electrical fundamentals (Maxwell) that E = 1/2 Q V where Q = integral over time of I dt, which is in amps*sec. where in our case, during the time interval, dt, we use the time-averaged value of the Lighthouse Frequency. For our test case, we assume it is approx. constant for small changes in time. E = V* I * t / 2 E = Volt * (Amp*sec)/2 Let's continue with an example case to solve for the approximate Volt*Amps*sec required: We will assume the total mass of our time machine is 160 kg. We will assume a time translation of 50 years, which gives a dc = 157.4645 m/s Therefore the Volt*Amp*sec required are: V*A*sec/2 = 2c * m * dc"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"V*A*sec = 2 * 2c * m * dc [units are m/s * kg * m/s] = 4 * c * 160 * 157.4645 = 3.02123E*13 volt*amps*sec = 30,212,288,673 kVA sec [units are kvolts * amps * sec] = 8,392,302 kW.hr which is a large amount of energy to discharge in a small fraction of a second. This amount of energy is placed on the shell housing of the Time Machine while simultaneously vibrating the skin at the Lighthouse Frequency - which is done by using a hyfrecator-type device. The Lighthouse Frequency is embedded in the discharge in the form of a square wave, for example. CONCLUSIONS An approximate solution has been provided to determine the amount of energy required for time travel. The concept is based upon a blinking universe.

FASTER-THAN-LIGHT TRAVEL: THE BASIC MECHANICS Abstract This short technical paper presents the first practical technology solution for traveling faster than the speed of light. Most of the hardware & technology necessary for the first tests have already been developed, although faster computer processors may be required for synchronization. Light-years of distance can be traversed by performing millions of “hops;” yet the entire distance traveled requires only a fraction of a second. Each reader must comprehend that our universe is blinking off and on, more than 1 trillion times every second.

We only know it has something to do with blinking.\" [1] Introduction Physicists now understand that time is an illusion in terms of relativity. However, this author proposes that time is an absolute illusion, which also renders the speed of light to be an illusion (because it is based upon time, meters/second). In our terms, the universe blinks off and on at a very high frequency.[2] We will call this the Lighthouse Frequency, or the natural resonant frequency of our universe. In order to understand the basic mechanics of faster-than-light travel, it is necessary first to understand that our universe exists in very different terms than science or religion has taught for centuries. In our terms, the blinking rate of the universe is important, but regardless of the exact number, it is so large as to be beyond the comprehension of our usual senses. In larger terms and from a larger perspective, there is no blinking at all because all of time is simultaneous. So from the limited perspective of a universe within a multiverse consisting of numberless dimensions, we must speak in terms of our perceptions while also considering the larger reality."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Background Everything in a physical universe has a natural, resonant frequency – including the universe itself.

This represents the first attempt to provide a real & practical technological means for travel to distant galaxies and return. In fact, the technology to perform faster-than-light travel is within our reach today. The primary equipment is already available: Launch vehicles, frequency generators, and frequency amplifiers (or hyfrecators). 5D Space As part of this discussion, it is necessary to introduce a concept that we will refer to as 5th Dimensional Space. This is a simple term, but can be easily misunderstood. Image a point in 3D space, that is connected to all dimensions, times, and probabilities. Taking one step in any “direction”, and any vehicle can enter a new reality, a different time period, or even a parallel universe. 5D space is not empty, quite the contrary – it is full, providing access to almost everything we could possibly access. Think of 5D space as a “Grand Central Station” for embarking on any travel. One analogy of this idea is how natural white light contains all of the colors of the rainbow - it can be split thru a prism and then seen as separate colors. Also keep in mind, we are “containing” the idea of what happens when the universe blinks “off” each “time,” in our"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"terms. Hold out your arm and wave it. You have just moved your arm through quadrillions of universes and had a slight effect on each of them. You cannot see them, but there is no real distance between you and these other universes. These probabilities vary by time, distance, and alternatives that are so mathematically large that it is beyond our comprehension. However, if you understand this simple analogy, then you basically understand what is meant by fifth dimensional space. It is everywhere. It is right in front of your eyes, but does not reach your conscious awareness. Under normal circumstances, only one universe is available to your conscious mind and any given instant. There are at least 3 kinds of travel, in our terms. Travel through time, travel across distance, and travel to alternate probabilities/parallel universes. (There is also travel between dimensions, in our terms, however it is beyond this scope of discussion.) The first thing to understand is that there is no such thing as time from a larger perspective. I will refer the reader to my previous papers on this topic.[3] It might be summarized that all of time is really an alternate probability of the present moment; and analogously, that each point in space represents an alternate probability of the point you presently occupy. From a mathematical perspective, it is all probabilities. As all probabilities exist simultaneously, it is possible to travel to a parallel universe that we would call forwards or backwards in time, however it exists as a “horizontal” and simultaneous present reality. Voltage, amperage, and phase angle differentiate and define the local probable universe, IN OUR TERMS (This point must be emphasized.) To better understand the Electrical Universe and its properties, a reading of reference [3] and [9] is suggested. Technical Requirements The equipment needed can be summarized as follows: 1) Spacecraft vehicle similar to Apollo or Orion manned vehicle and associated launch system 2) Precision frequency generator 3) Precision frequency amplifier unit – This unit will vibrate the hull and vehicle in a uniform and synchronized manner. (Alternately: a Hyfrecator or Electric arc welding unit with high- frequency stimulator – the capability to produce multiple high-amp pulses at the correct frequency, on the surface of the vehicle.) 4) Electrical generation system and/or large capacity battery storage system Description of Galactic Travel"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"As a useful discussion, let’s take a journey that will be made in the not-so-distant future. This is a journey to a planetary system that is many light years away. Such a mission might be compared to the Apollo 10 mission, in that all of the equipment for landing was available if needed, but the mission’s objective was simply to demonstrate the safe capability. We will launch from our home planet in a traditional rocket vehicle. After establishing low- earth orbit, we accelerate our vehicle to leave orbit. For reasons of safety, we will leave Earth’s orbit and travel many thousands of miles outside of the plane of ecliptic. The vehicle is then pointed in the desired direction of travel and accelerated. We will then neutralize any residual static or electrical charges on the vehicle. This is because in 5D space, time and distance translation are determined by electrical charge. In our terms, voltage, amperage, and phase angle determine the position with respect to other probable universes. Once the calculations are double-checked and the vehicle is then neutralized again as a safety check, we push the button. This button turns on a frequency generator and a precise electrical charge which places the vehicle into a “stasis” or “suspended animation”. Because the vehicle is being vibrated at the blinking frequency of the universe and a voltage equal to its Electrical Mass (in the Electrical Universe) is applied to the surface – the vehicle “rides” between universes. For a moment, the vehicle is now between universes, in our terms. The unique frequency pervades and covers the entire vehicle. The charge on the skin of the vehicle is a pure voltage, involving almost zero current while vibrating it at the Lighthouse Frequency. These 2 signals are combined into one. We are dealing with math in the Electrical Universe, which governs the physics we experience in our Physical Universe. Another analogy that may be helpful is comparing an electrical system to a hydraulic-water system. Voltage can be compared to pressure and amperage compared to flow. While in a state of stasis, this is a system with pressure, but no flow. Again, to better understand the Electrical Universe and its properties, a reading of reference [3] and [9] is suggested. We know from Einstein that all mass can be described as energy. E=mc 2 Another way to describe this energy is: Equation 1.1 Energy = Volt*(Amp*sec) Physical mass in our physical universe can be equated with an Electrical Mass or Volts in the Electrical Universe:"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Equation 1.2 Volts = x*Mass where x is a unique constant or Dimensional Translation Unit (DTU) for each vehicle that must be experimentally determined. (Amp*sec) in the Electrical Universe can also be described as a “Range” or Electrical Frequency. This is what we perceive as distance in our physical universe. Keep in mind, in the Electrical Universe, there is no such thing as time, distance, or velocity. Everything is located at a single point. Basically, we are placing a mass into a state of stasis, and then manipulating its Electrical Range to move it thru a distance, in our terms. [Side Note: Colonel Philip Corso actually witnessed and described an encounter with a vehicle that was electrically charged in a stationary stasis. To him, the grounded vehicle seemed to fade in and out of our universe, and at times seemed transparent. Recorded 1997. See youtube for references. The technical reason for this fluctuation is that the signal generator on the vehicle is not precisely generating the Lighthouse Frequency at all times, in our terms.] Distance of each hop (D’) is proportional to (Amp*sec) applied Equation 1.3 D' = y *(Amp*sec) where y is a unique constant or Dimensional Translation Unit (DTU) in our terms, that must be experimentally determined for each vehicle and electrical configuration. Note that a vehicle’s electrical system that is capable of generating larger impulses (Amp*sec) will be able to achieve larger “hops.” The total distance covered is then equal to the sum total of the individual hops: Equation 1.4"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":" where D T is the total distance covered, and k is the total number of hops, assuming each hop is of equal distance. (Each electrical system will have its own “deterioration” during such jumps, and this will need to be taken into account.) The distance is traversed using millions of “hops” or “jumps.” There must be maintained a delicate balance of electrical charge to accomplish this. The (Amp*sec) within each discharge is an impulse spike that must be exactly synchronized with the blinking frequency of the universe. To travel several light-years, this is performed through millions of “hops,” but the entire distance is covered in a fraction of a second. The vehicle occupants cannot perceive what has happened because it occurs so quickly. If the impulses are not properly synchronized, the vehicle will be either shifted in time, or moved to a parallel/probable universe - neither of which is desired. The goal is to stay within the current universe, while simply changing distance, in our terms. Figure 1. Faster than Light travel thru impulse “hops.” Each hop must be precisely synchronized with the blinking frequency of the universe. Each hop can cover many kilometers, and the entire distance traveled (many light years), happens in a fraction of a second. So, the combined “hops” thru space are not perceived by the vehicle occupants. It happens in a fraction of a second. And now while looking out the vehicle windows, the travelers see an entirely different planetary system close by, and their destination planet in view at a distance. The vehicle has arrived several hours outside of the local plane of ecliptic and will travel thru conventional space using ordinary means of rocket propulsion, and slow to local orbital velocity.

Some distant destinations may be done in “segments”, to allow for precise targeting of vectors and electrical charge.

However, test objects in a lab will simply disappear. Their final destination in time or space will not be known. It is, unfortunately, also easy to predict that some early crews will be forever lost in time or space, until the correct constants for each vehicle are precisely known, and the precise techniques and procedures performed. Early tests might best be performed using satellites. By performing test jumps that photograph the position of the stars, we should be able to develop the precise math relationships and “constants” between impulse and distance translations and electrical charge. (Author's note: All “physical constants” will vary over time, in our terms. [4] However, for most purposes, we may assume the values are constant for the distance-travel involved.) It is recommended that each vehicle have the capability to detect and modify the Lighthouse Frequency that is used to make the \"hops.\" If any shift in time or parallel universe occurs, then the frequency that is delivered to the vehicle surface will need to be re-calibrated. Conclusions This technical note has described the basic mechanics/procedures for travel at faster-than- light speed, in our terms, in terms of ordinary spacetime, it can potentially be millions of times faster than the speed of light. For the technical purist however, this does not mean the speed of light has been violated, because most of the distance was traveled outside of ordinary spacetime. This document is a living document.

The Perfect Carrier Wave: SETI's Perfect Signal Abstract This brief technical paper discusses the idea of a unique frequency that has unusual characteristics. This frequency can be utilized as the perfect carrier wave for instantaneous communication across vast distances – even between galaxies. Any advanced civilization would certainly use this frequency in their communications. This frequency can be found at the harmonics of approximately 1.1 THz, or beginning with 2.2 THz (trillion cycles per second). Each reader must comprehend that our universe literally blinks, off and on, more than one trillion times each second. For more than two years, this author has been stalked, harassed, and threatened by US Government agents from the CIA, FBI, and NSA; because of the content of these ebooks. They have repeatedly broken into my house. They have hacked my phone, computer, and alarm system – including those of my friends and family. It is truly sad and pathetic, these agencies have become criminal organizations. Introduction In 1950, Enrico Fermi postulated what is known as the Fermi Parado x; whereby, it seems statistically probable that our galaxy must be full of intelligent life. In fact, the initial estimates suggest we should be hearing substantial artifacts of galactic communication. Were we missing what seemed to be a statistical certainty, or were we simply looking in the wrong place? It seems the answer is the latter. This paper proposes the existence of a perfect carrier wave. It occurs at the natural resonant frequency of our universe. Nearly perfect and instantaneous communication is possible across vast distances. Any intelligent civilization would certainly use this frequency as because it is lossless, stable, reliable, and undistorted. A minimal amount of power and antennae size would be required, and could be used anywhere. A wealth of data is there and waiting for listening. Readers are encouraged to review the background papers on this subject, as it will make more sense. [1],[2],[3] In summary, our universe literally blinks off and on, at approximately 1.1 THz. This blinking creates a fundamental absolute frequency that can be detected anywhere in the universe using appropriate instruments. We will call this frequency – the Lighthouse Frequency. Keep in mind this unique frequency is a pure tone, and has a very narrow bandwidth. It may"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"be overlooked by spectrum analyzers without sufficient resolution. Figure 1. SETI's current search spectrum. Note that the frequency we are discussing exists just to right of this chart – at about 1039 GHz, with a first harmonic of 2079 GHz. [5] The first harmonic of this frequency is the lowest frequency which can be utilized. This is due to the unusual nature of the fundamental frequency – in that, it does not exist, in our terms. Our universe does not experience one complete cycle of the base frequency, which means that it cannot be detected. However, the first harmonic and other harmonics of the base frequency, can be detected and generated. Companies such as OML in Morgan, California manufacture harmonic mixtures which can achieve these high frequencies. [6] In fact, Terahertz Spectroscopy is an important research area for astrophysicists. In 2008, a Japanese team assembled a terahertz-capable spectrum analyzer. [7] Conclusions This paper proposes the existence of a unique frequency with unusual characteristics. Our use of this frequency may be a minimum requirement of the “Galactic Club”, which may then allow us regular communications with other advanced civilizations. Also for speculation and consideration, it may be possible to use this frequency to communicate between different time periods and parallel universes."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The value of this carrier frequency cannot be underestimated.

Abstract This short technical paper describes the basic theory and design for floating cities in the clouds, which have been described in numerous science fiction books and movies. Any structure or object can be made to behave as though it were essentially massless. This is done by synchronizing an electrical signal on the surface of the object with the blinking frequency of our universe (Lighthouse Frequency) which is 1.1 THz. Imagine a sine wave split by the x-axis with the top half representing matter and the bottom half representing antimatter. The x-axis being sequential time, in our terms. Each time the sine wave crosses the x-axis, all fundamental forces collapse to zero (representing the single point of the Electrical Universe). When we synchronize an electrical signal with the sine wave, just before crossing the x-axis, all objects and structures will behave as though they are massless. Note that this feature explains the Hutchison Effect, which is basically operating at a harmonic of the Lighthouse Frequency. The Hutchison Effect has demonstrated “levitation” many times. Each reader must comprehend that our physical universe literally blinks off and on, more than one trillion times every second. Introduction Previous papers on the Lighthouse Frequency have shown how the blinking of our physical universe can be utilized for three kinds of travel:[1], [2] 1) Time Travel 2) Distance Travel 3) Travel between parallel universes In this paper, we will discuss utilizing the Lighthouse Frequency for “levitation” of an object. Some might call this “antigravity,” however, technically this is not correct. The buildings in our city in the sky give the illusion of floating, in our terms, because part of the time they are in “free-fall” and part of the time, they are floating. The average of these values, gives the apparent “antigravity” effect. So part of the time, our buildings have mass, and part of the time they are massless. By manipulating the percent of time between these values, we can make the buildings rise or fall in altitude in a gradual way. Let's begin by defining some terms: ENP - Expanding Neutral Point; this point is an overlap point between matter and antimatter, just as matter begins to re-materialize or “blink on” from the previous construction."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CNP - Collapse Neutral Point; this point is also an overlap point between matter and antimatter. (Note that these terms are arbitrary because from the perspective of the negative universe or antimatter – the terms would be reversed.) Figure 1. Note that the red line identifies a frequency that is precisely synchronized to pulse just before the CNP occurs each interval. At this precise moment, the mass of any object will seem to be nearly zero. An object or structure will respond to the electrical signal as though it had near-zero mass.[5] In our terms, as the physical universe collapses each interval (at the CNP), the gravitational force and the physical mass of each object will seem to approach zero. This can be expressed: g ----> 0 m ----> 0 If we take one small fraction of an interval “backwards” from the CNP, the gravitational force and the physical mass of an object will have very small values relative to their “time- averaged” values. In our terms, this would be much less than 0.1% of the “time-averaged” value. To precisely maintain synchronization with this point in the blinking universe is not a simple task, technologically. It will require digital sampling, signal generation, and amplification that are beyond current technology. This technological development can be achieved using a Gamma-Ray Clock (GRC), which breaks down the intervals of time to about 10^21 cycles per"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"second. And while weak signals can be generated now, large amplification of the signal will be required for them to be useful. It may also be possible to directly utilize the Neutral Points thru synchronization. Although in theory, this may imply that an object has zero mass, and the equations for such a point become a singularity or unsolvable. We now understand that it is possible to synchronize with a moment in blinking time, when the gravitational force and physical mass are close to zero. The energy required to “levitate” entire buildings is quite small, because it has nothing to do with the static mass of the object or structure. Figure 2. Building subsegment. Each isolated structure is limited to about 300 stories, because the generated signal may become too weak beyond this distance. (Note that Al Beilek mentioned this regarding his travel to the 28 th century.) This makes it possible to have structures more than 1 mile high (1700 meters) by utilizing building segments. Each segment is floated separately. There is no limit to how high the structure can be made."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Figure 3. Basic electronics package consisting of 5 main components. The Gamma-Ray Clock breaks down each moment (one trillionth of a second) into much smaller intervals (about 10^21) The Synchronizer uses the timing signal from the Gamma-Ray Clock to correctly identify the Neutral Points in the cycle and properly insert an electrical trigger point for the Signal Generator, which generates a harmonic of the Lighthouse Frequency (i.e., 2.2 THz, 4.4 THz, etc.) The Signal Amplifier then increases the “volume” of the signal so that it can transit the entire building without being attenuated or muted. A battery backup is provided for redundancy purposes. Conclusions So we have attempted to define a point within the blinking physical universe whereby the gravitational force and physical mass of objects approach a value of zero. This is significant because it makes some things possible that were previously considered impossible. Also note that the “overlap” points or Neutral Points present us with a unique opportunity to glimpse into the universe of negative matter or antimatter.

The avoided-cost savings for the US, could exceed $50 Billion USD over twenty years. This technology is based on a derivative of time travel. Each reader must comprehend that our universe literally blinks off and on, many billions of times every second. Introduction Readers are encouraged to review references [1] and [2] prior to this paper, as this short paper will make more sense. The launch vehicle and launch services for a typical telecommunications satellite cost around $120MM USD. [3] This is only the cost of the launch vehicle and launch services. The cost of the satellite is separate. According to reference [3] in typical USD ($ millions): Satellite Manufacture $150MM Satellite Launch $120MM Launch Insurance $ 20MM In-Orbit Insurance $ 20MM Satellite Operations $ 15MM Total $325MM In 2011, DARPA estimated that some satellites were costing up to $30,000 per pound ($66,100 per kg) to place in orbit, so there is a real incentive to find lower-cost methods for placing satellites in orbit.[4] Virgin Galactic has stated for the media they intend to offer some launch services (under 500 lbs) at less than $10 MM per satellite.[5] And while this is certainly more attractive financially, what if we could greatly reduce these costs? Satellites are becoming smaller and less expensive, mostly due to the advances in electronics, while the launch costs remain prohibitive for mass commercial use. Proposed in this paper is one practical use for electrical time travel technology, which has been described in previous papers.[6] The cost to place a 500 kg satellite (including the booster engine) into orbit can be done at a cost of approximately $2 USD worth of electricity. Two US dollars. The explanation follows:"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Our earth is orbiting the sun at 67,000 miles per hour (108,000 km per hour). If you are located at the equator, you are also spinning at approximately 1000 miles per hour (1610 km per hour). If we use time-forwarding to place a satellite in orbit, the satellite will not maintain our inertial reference frame. If, for example, it is sent 20 minutes into the future, this becomes a position about 22,000 miles out in space, in our terms. (There are other secondary effects which we will neglect for the purposes of this discussion.) From this position, a satellite would immediately descend in free-fall towards the earth, accelerating as it descends. In effect, this free energy becomes the first propellant stage for the vehicle. As the satellite descends, a typical Holman orbit transfer can be initiated which will circularize and stabilize the orbit. Figure 1. The Satellite is designed with a special aluminum shroud that is discarded in space. The shroud protects the satellite electronics from the large electric charge that forwards the vehicle in time."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Figure 2. After being time-forwarded, the Satellite will immediately begin a free- fall. The booster engine is then used to circularize the orbit. Conclusions This paper has described a novel and low-cost method for placing satellites in orbit. The cost is so low, that individual consumers may be able to use the technology in the near future. For example, an expendable CubeSat could be placed in space without a typical propulsion system, and although it would have a short life, it could collect data and/or take pictures for about 45 minutes (free fall). The cost to place it in space would be less than $1 USD of electricity. An interesting question to ask is: How much does the US spend on launch vehicles, launch services, and launch insurance each year? Now multiply that number times 20 years – that's the avoided cost in using this technology. An initial estimate probably places this value at over $50 Billion USD.

Photonic Travel: Riding on a Beam of Light TABLE OF CONTENTS Abstract This short technical paper describes the technology that will be used to colonize distant plan - ets in other solar systems. It is the most efficient form of transportation that is possible utiliz - ing physical matter. A 5 watt laser pulse can be used to \"push\" a vehicle from Earth to Mars in about 12 minutes, at the speed of light. The passengers, however, do not feel any g-forces because they are essentially massless. The technology is described along with the mathe - matical considerations. Suggestions for further research are made. Introduction Some of today's most accurate atomic clocks are based on the cesium fountain, which oper - ates at approximately 9.2 billion cycles per second. In order to make photonic travel possible, it is necessary to have more precise clocks - orders of magnitude faster. Even a clock based on an Optical Frequency Comb is probably too slow. An x-ray or gamma-ray timing mecha - nism is required. This means a precision device that emits a reliable and precise pulse at 10^17 cycles per second or faster. This allows a single cycle of the blinking frequency of our universe (Lighthouse Frequency) to be divided into a hundred thousand or more intervals - very precise. At this small interval, we are able to delicately approach the Collapsing Neutral Point (CNP), without crossing it. [3]"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Figure 1 . By synchronizing with the Lighthouse Frequency and \"pulsing\" as close as possible to the Collapsing Neutral Point (CNP), we are able to minimize the mass of the vehicle. [4] Photons Photons are thought to be massless. In fact, they are not. What makes the four \"massless\" elementary particles unique, is they possess the quality of variable mass. In our terms, the time-averaged mass value is very close to zero. However, a photon also has a maximum mass value (MASS max ), in our terms. There are four compelling reasons for us to understand photons are not massless: 1) Photons are affected by gravity. (starlight bends around the sun during an eclipse) 2) In tests using superconductors, photons have been found to have a non-zero rest mass. 3) The QAM model displays a Mass Gap before the first Mass Group.[2] 4) GUT Theory describes Mass as the 4th dimension, not time.[3] Therefore, Mass is a re - quired attribute to exist in a physical universe. When we precisely synchronize our vehicle with the blinking frequency of our local universe, we can approach a near-zero mass or minimum vehicle mass (MASS vehicle ), such that a group of photons \"pushing\" the vehicle have significantly more mass than the vehicle:"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"equation 1.1 MASS max >> MASS vehicle For a photon: equation 1.2 E 2 = p 2 c 2 + m 2 c 4 where p is the magnitude of the momentum vector of the photon and equation 1.3 p = hv/c where h is plank's constant and c is the speed of light. This manipulation of physical matter makes riding on a beam of light possible. [5] The average distance from Earth to Mars is about 225 million kilometers, or about 12 minutes at the speed of light. Technically, the vehicle is riding on the wavefront of a group of photons emitted from a laser. A 5 watt laser pulse is sufficient to \"push\" a vehicle from Earth to Mars in about 12 minutes. Consider the amount of energy used to power a 5 watt laser and most engineers will agree - this is the most efficient form of transportation that is possible utilizing physical matter. The wavefront idea can be compared to a surfer riding on a wave approaching the beach. The mass of the water in the wave is much larger than the mass of the surfer and his board, yet it does not slow down the wave by having the rider on it. The vehicle's passengers will not feel large g-forces because they are effectively \"massless\". For a passenger, it will seem the journey happens in seconds, not 12 minutes, due to the time distortion from relativity. While for an external observer, it took 12 minutes for the vehicle to transit the distance. This means that the external observer has aged 12 minutes, while the passengers have aged only seconds, in our terms."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"This amazing method of travel will make it possible for us to colonize other solar systems and planets.

Terraforming the Atmosphere of Venus Abstract The atmosphere of Venus is 96% carbon dioxide, with low water and oxygen content. This short technical paper addresses altering the atmosphere for human habitation. The technology to perform this already exists. It was used on the World Trade Center on 9-11- 2001 (reference DrJudyWood.com) The infrared lasers used to destroy the buildings is a type of rapid-aging technology. This same technology can be used to rapidly-age carbon dioxide molecules, and break them down into oxygen. This technology is combined with using one or more of the resonant frequencies of carbon dioxide to accelerate its breakdown. It should be noted these unique infrared lasers are far more powerful than ordinary lasers. Many of these lighter molecules will escape the atmosphere, reducing the atmospheric pressure at ground level. The first recommendation of this paper is to launch a satellite into Venus' orbit and begin performance tests to determine how many satellites would be required to sufficiently alter the atmosphere within a reasonable period of 20 years. To reduce the launch costs, it is recommended to use t\\he technique for orbital insertion described in a prior ebook, “The Use of Time-Forwarding to Place Satellites in Orbit.” This same technique might also be used to place the satellite closer to the orbital distance of Venus, reducing the fuel requirements. The summary conclusion is that 50 high-power, infrared lasers, operated for 20 years would substantially alter the atmosphere of Venus. It must be emphasized, this is a very rough estimate to indicate that further research might be directed to achieve possible results. Introduction Molecular and diatomic oxygen would be produced during the break down of carbon dioxide. For discussion purposes, we will assume that the total weight of carbon in the atmosphere of Venus is approximately 10^20 kg, and the total weight of oxygen is approximately 3 x 10^20 kg. 3 If we assume that the infrared laser can rapidly age 1 million tons of molecules in 8 seconds, then how many lasers and how much time is needed to bring the atmosphere to a reasonable level? There are many assumptions we must make for a rough approximation, because there is little public information about the capabilities of this infrared laser. It must be emphasized, these are not ordinary infrared lasers. They have unique qualities that are derived from operating at a harmonic of the the Lighthouse Frequency. They are far more powerful, in the same way that a nuclear bomb is far more powerful than TNT."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"We can estimate that the laser operates at a frequency of 256 x 1.1 THz = 282 THz, which is a strong harmonic of the Lighthouse Frequency (the blinking frequency of our universe). So in kilograms, we will estimate that 113 million kilograms of molecules can be rapidly-aged per second, per laser. We will also assume that about one-third of the molecules will be lost due to atmospheric escape and other losses, during the lasing. This gives us about 3.5 x 10^12 seconds for one laser. Now, let's also assume that we can scale up the laser in size to achieve a power level that is 100 times greater than was used on the World Trade Center. This results in the number: About 50 infrared lasers, parked in orbit, and used for 20 years would achieve a substantial alteration of the atmosphere. Also, we do not need to completely reduce all carbon dioxide, and we would need to account for maintenance and down-time for the lasers, etc. The point being, this seems to be an achievable scenario. Figure 1. Infrared Laser orbiting Venus. (not to scale) This is a first step in a process of terraforming to achieve a habitable planet, but it is a significant step. Further research is recommended."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Figure 2. Cycle of our blinking universe. Rapid aging occurs at a harmonic of the E point. Conclusions So we have described a possible scenario using infrared lasers to alter the atmosphere of Venus. Further research could be performed, given some additional information on the laser's capabilities. There are numerous secondary effects of the lasers; heating, escape loss, pressure drop, etc., and other factors that would need to be considered. Actual missions would probably require a number of additional steps before the planet could be considered habitable, but this is clearly an important first step. If some readers object to my numbers or derivation, they are invited to develop their own. The conclusion will likely be the same – the technology is within our reach.

Clearing Satellite Debris from Orbit Abstract Satellite debris in earth orbit is becoming a significant problem, that will only increase, unless we find methods to remove or otherwise dispose of dead satellites. There is a temporary graveyard for some satellites, that is located at geosyncronous orbit plus 300 km, and while this may acknowledge the problem, a longer-term solution is needed. To remove bulk material from orbit is not a simple problem, because the debris field can be quite large. Any type of netting or capture system will have a limited life, and consume too much fuel to accomplish multiple missions. The cost alone, makes this impractical. This short ebook presents a low-cost method for sending dead satellites into a solar trajectory, for permanent disposal. Proposed here is a simple system that can be used many times. It is based on a ground- controlled system that renders the satellite massless, and allows it to achieve escape velocity. By timing the trajectory correctly – the satellite and debris field can be sent towards the sun, and will eventually burn up. This system can be used for polar orbits or earth-inclined orbits. Readers are encouraged to watch the videos made by John Hutchison, as the ability to render a object massless, has already been proven. This is done by vibrating the object at the blinking frequency of our universe – the Lighthouse Frequency. Introduction John Hutchison of Canada, began using radio frequencies blended with light xrays to randomly achieve a weightless state for objects. These objects included bowling balls and other things. He was not able to predict or describe the theory behind this weightless effect. Dr Judy Wood mentioned his experiments, in her book about the World Trade Towers and 9- 11."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"You can find numerous videos by John Hutchison online. Figure U-1.

In orbit, the objects(s) and debris will continue in a forward path at their current velocity. By holding the debris in this stasis electrical field for about 5 - 10 minutes – the debris will achieve escape velocity. The actual time required is dependent upon its current orbit and altitude.

Minimizing Energy Requirements for Time Travel Abstract This short technical note provides a possible solution for minimizing the energy required for time travel.

The Single Cure: Human Life Extension to 300+ Years Dedicated to my friend, Jim Dowd Abstract This short technical paper describes the use of a proposed technology that may be able to time-regress the human body. The cure for nearly all adult diseases, illness, and injuries may be close to our achievement. This paper describes a process for \"regressing\" the human body to an earlier time of health. For example, an individual that is injured in a car accident, could have instant repairs made to the human body. The device could be available inside of a typical ambulance. For a person with cancer, a process could be available to instantly “re - move” the cancer and return the body to a time when no illness existed. The process is called Newtonian Superposition. This process could be repeated many times for a healthy adult, effectively providing individuals with the alternative of living 300 or more years. The re - gression under the electric charge requires less than one second to occur. The math used to perform the calculation is provided. Introduction Health care costs are increasing at a rate that exceeds inflation. The problem is acute for res - idents of the United States, where health care costs typically increase at 2 - 3% per year above the rate of inflation. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that, the United States spends more on health care per person (about $8,600), and more on the health care percentage of GDP (about 18%), than all other countries. A 2013 Bloomberg ranking of countries with the most efficient health care, the United States ranked 46th out of 48 countries in the study.[1] Imagine a technology that solved almost all of the cost issues associated with health care. This may seem improbable, but the technology may be close at hand. Using the natural resonant frequency of our universe and a source of electricity may be all that is required. It is called the Lighthouse Frequency and has many applications. The tech - nology allows for a time-regression of the body's cells, such that a person’s body will suddenly"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"look and act as it did at an earlier time. For many emergency injuries, an hour of cellular re - gression is all that is required. The healing is instantaneous. If my calculations are correct (they are close enough to be corrected with precise values for m, c and dc), the electricity to perform a single person time-regression would currently cost about $40 per day (2013 $USD) of time regression.[4] However, for most emergencies, the cost would be less. For a person injured in a car accident, about $5 in electrical cost, and the body can be instantly healed.* For a gunshot wound, the projectile would need to be re - moved, but the cost to instantly heal the body would also require about $5 of electricity. Even people that are \"clinically dead\" could be restored to 100% health, assuming they have quick access to a machine. No doctors would be needed to perform this technology, as trained technicians could easily operate the machines. The common cold could be cured. Broken bones, cancer, even unknown diagnoses could be solved, simply by regressing a patient's cells. In short, the technology could be a possible solution to the global health care problem. *Note that capital costs of the equipment have been excluded because over a useful period of time, these costs are small compared to the operational costs. So how does this technology work? There is a principle in the scientific community called, \"Newtonian Superposition,\" so-named for Isaac Newton. This means the summation of force vectors, however in practical terms it means subtracting time from the body's cells. It is basically time travel confined to a specific area. To better understand this concept, it is first necessary to understand that our universe literally blinks off and on, at a very fast rate. While this idea may disturb some readers, keep in mind it is something beyond our perceptions - it simply happens much too fast - faster than our perceptions and faster than most instruments can measure. As an example of life extension; a person at 50 years of age, could visit a facility and be placed in one of the aluminum shells. After a brief calculation is performed, an electric charge is sent through the shell which regresses the body tissues to a time of about 30 years of age. The electric charge lasts a small fraction of a second. The patient can immediately sit up. There is no recovery period associated with traditional surgeries. The technology is the same for injuries – the only difference is the amount of electricity used for the procedure. More electricity equals a greater time difference. There are many practical applications for utilizing the Lighthouse Frequency - the natural resonant frequency of our universe. [5] In our terms, there is a force vector that newly constructs each cell in your body, during each brief time interval. By using this technology, we are applying a force that subtracts from the original force vector. For example, a bodily organ that is 50 years old, can have a (-20) year force added to it, which results in an organ that looks and acts like 30 years old again. Anoth - er way of describing this - the cellular memory is \"overlayed,\" such that the cells have no memory of aging for the prior 20 years, so the cells \"think\" like a 30 year old. Or still another"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"way of viewing this concept, for those with a background in statistics and probabilities; all probabilities exist simultaneously for each person, in our terms. So the NS process is simply replacing an earlier probability over the currently perceived probability. Here is a summary of the math involved, which is reduced from reference [4]: If we evaluate the change in energy required to reconstruct a unit mass, over a time interval equal to a single cycle of the Lighthouse Frequency: dE = m * 2c (dc) Where c is the speed of light, dc is the change in the speed of light, and dE is the change in total energy. For small changes in time and the speed of light, we will assume it is approximated by the equation: y = 3.149 x where y is the change in the speed of light (dc), and x is the number of years. The mass in this case would be approximately equal to the mass of the patient. The time regression period would be calculated based on the change in the speed of light during the period. This equals a change of approximately 3 meters per second per year – for the variation in the speed of light (out of 300 million m/s – a very small change). Experimental tests can deter - mine the precise values to use for any individual or time period. A more complete derivation of the math can be found in the references. The NS process could be repeated a number of times, allowing a typical healthy person to re - turn to their optimal bodily health at approximately 30 years of age. Note that in Figure 1, the head area surrounding the brain is exposed. This is due to the fact that the brain structure might be adversely affected by an NS process, ie., the structure of the brain may be adversely altered and/or access to certain memories and recall. To compensate for this area, there can be magnetic masks or other small shells that could be constructed to minimize the effect on the underlying brain. The goal would be provide NS to the facial skin and tissue without affecting the brain."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Figure 1. How a typical unit might appear. The use of magnetic material around the edge of the open end may provide a gentle NS transition/effect on the head area. Experimental tests could be performed to determine if this is required. Note that it may be possible to combine multiple patients into a single electric charge, using multiple units, which could reduce the cost for each. Also note that the inside lining of the aluminum shell must be electrically-insulated to contain the large electric charge which is used. Other Applications It may also be possible to perform the time-regression on individual organs, such as a pan - creas or heart. A failed pancreas could be removed during surgery, and time regressed as an individual or - gan, then replaced back into the body as a healthy organ. Another possible option is to take some cells from a failing heart, and mix them with stem cells to create the beginnings of a new heart organ. The cells are then incubated for a period of time, and then when mature enough, the mixture of cells are time forwarded by about 20 years to create a new heart. The beauty of this method, is that there is little risk of rejection by the body. Let's estimate some numbers: Weight of stem cell mixture = .001 grams (for calculation purposes, this value can be as - sumed to be zero) Average weight of adult heart = 300 grams = .3 kg Time-averaged weight of heart over first 20 years, will be assumed to be .3 kg, but it is actual - ly slightly less.

Time- forwarding technology allows the seed to be instantly converted into a mature stalk of corn. Technically, we could call it Newtonian Superposition, which is a summation of forces. But, if you prefer 'time travel' for vegetables, that works just as well. This discussion is about the economics of food production. The typical American spends $151 per week on food. This compares with a large-scale synthetic food production facility that will make it possible to provide nearly unlimited vegetables and fruits at less than 1 cent per person per day. This is extraordinary. The facility is minimally self-sustaining, and could be utilized for a wide variety of vegetables and fruits – it also produces new seeds for the next crop generation. The process can also be adapted for use on Mars, or any planet with sunlight and a source of water. An example is provided using ordinary sweet corn, but this same process can be used to produce a variety of fruits and vegetables. Each reader must comprehend that our universe literally blinks, off and on, approximately 1 trillion times every second (1.1 THz). By using this blinking frequency, it is possible to travel through time, sending objects or seeds forward in time, in less than one second. Chapter 1. Introduction The math for time travel has been previously explained. [1] Using this idea of parallel/probable universes, it is possible to use time translation to rapidly grow all kinds of vegetables and fruits. Technically, we could call it Newtonian Superposition, which is a summation of forces. But, if you prefer 'time travel' for vegetables, that works just as well. This discussion is about the economics of food production. The typical American spends $100 to $300 per month on food and groceries. This compares with a large-scale synthetic food production facility that will make it possible to provide nearly unlimited vegetables and"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"fruits at less than 1 cent per person per day. This is extraordinary. In Figure 1, we see a basic flow chart, which is quite simple. Electricity, seeds, and water as input – fresh corn as output. Figure 1. Synthetic Production Facility Preliminary Design - Basic Configuration Germination racks are used for much of the area inside the building. This allows for a continuous flow of product into the Time Translation Machine (TTM). Germination times will vary depending on the type of seed and variety, but typically on the order of an hour or two . Once the germination process is initiated, the seed can be placed into the TTM. The TTM is basically an aluminum structure that contains the energy for time travel. This has been described in my previous technical papers. Our universe literally blinks, off and on, at 1.1 trillion cycles per second. This blinking frequency can be used to travel thru time."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Figure 2.

Preliminary Design - Basic Configuration for the Facility The Facility is approximately 10 by 30 meters for indoor germination. External or outside germination is also possible to provide greater capacity. Solar panels are sized to accommodate the electrical consumption and the energy required to operate the TTM. Blue or red spectrum laser light may be best for initiating germination. Figure 4. Time Translation Machine – base is approximately 3 meters by 5 meters. Capacity of 100 stalks of mature corn. Construction is thin-sheet aluminum. Similar to a conventional backyard aluminum shed. Seedlings or germinated seeds are placed inside the TTM, and an electric charge is provided to the aluminum structure. This electric charge has 2 components. One is for the energy to perform the time translation, and the other is to vibrate the structure at the Lighthouse Frequency, which is the natural resonant frequency of our universe. [2] When properly timed and controlled, the TTM takes the seedlings to a mature stalk in less than one second. For the case of sweet corn, we will use an example case of “Trinity,” which is a popular varietal with a 70-day maturity period. See Appendix. Electrical operating costs on a daily basis are estimated at $35 USD. Note that over a 30 year period, the Capital Costs to build the facility are considered small relative to the long- term operating costs. This means that about $35 USD per day can feed several thousand people. To accelerate the germination phase, it may be possible to use the following process:"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Germination Process 1. Soak the seeds in a shallow tray of water. The water tray is placed under gro-lights, LED lights, or laser light during the soaking. A small DC electric charge of 0.1 mA - 1.0 mA is applied to the tray (6 - 12 VDC). Seeds are soaked for about one hour. 2. Drain the tray, and let stand for another 5 to 30 minutes at the optimal germination temperature. (For corn, it is around 77 F) 3. Place in the TTM. This process can be optimized through experiment, depending on the type of seeds. Large-scale facilities can be designed to feed one million people or more. As the process is scaled up, the effective cost becomes much less than 1 cent per person per day. Further Research In theory, based on Seth's Basic Law of Infinite Change and Transmutation, it should be possible to alter the structure of any mass. For example, a one kilogram rock can be altered into a one kilogram apple. There are three properties of physical matter: [5] 1. Spontaneous 2. Instantaneous 3. Pattern Assumption The Mass (volts) and Range (amp*sec) of an object exist in the electrical universe, but the shape, size, color, texture, etc., - do not exist as permanent attributes. These are arbitrarily perceived by the viewers in a physical universe. So the basic idea is to alter an object by pattern assumption. Future research may be able to determine a practical method to apply pattern assumption to any mass. Chapter 2. Conclusions This paper has presented a concept for the mass production of food at extremely low cost. It has emphasized the economics and cost associated with food production, and proposed a"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"radical new method at a substantial savings in time and money.

These restored structures can be used to provide housing for the homeless. An example structure is provided along with the basic calculations. Introduction Urban housing in many large cities is problematic due to many factors. Almost every large city in the world has buildings which are beyond economic repair and are left to the local government. Some of these buildings stand unused for many years. We will use an example hotel building that has stood vacant – which could make for excellent housing accommodations. This paper describes a process for restoring these old buildings at low cost. Figure 1. Vacant Hotel Building"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Proposed is the following: 1) Using large tarps or fabric cloths (similar to a parachute) which are impregnated with aluminum, will allow an electric charge to surround the entire structure. 2) The covering does not need to be perfectly seamless, it simply needs to be continuous. 3) The base part of the structure is the difficult part. Aluminized Fabric is used on the ground floor and connected to the outside cover via metal pins, near the ground floor. 4) Once the structure is surrounded, a 2-part electric charge is distributed thru the covering. One part is the energy required and the other part is the component that is synchronized with the Lighthouse Frequency. Figure 2. Aluminized fabric covers the entire building and ground floor. The pins or rods may need to be made of iron or magnetic material to “distribute” the charge around the base connections. Magnetic material may be required on the loose edge connections as well – this makes for a smoother transition between the old and new structure, particularly if there has been any movement during the time interval. The basic structure of the building is the only element that will experience a time translation, in our terms. Furniture, people, accessories will not transfer because these are not attached permanently to the structure. Another way of describing the process is; we are using Newtonian Superposition to choose one probability for the structure out of its vast field of probabilities, and overlaying this probability onto the present structure/space. The process"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"happens in less than one second. Defining some terms: ENP - Expanding Neutral Point; this point is an overlap point between matter and antimatter, just as matter begins to re-materialize or “blink on” from the previous construction. CNP - Collapse Neutral Point; this point is also an overlap point between matter and antimatter. Figure 3. The goal is to synchronize with the blinking frequency of our universe (Lighthouse Frequency) at a point which is very close to the Collapsing Neutral Point. This will result in a Massless Factor that is very small, which makes the effective mass of the structure very small. As the physical universe collapses each interval (at the CNP), the gravitational force and the physical mass of each object will seem to approach zero. This can be expressed: g ----> 0 m ----> 0 If we take one small fraction of an interval “backwards” from the CNP, the gravitational force and the physical mass of an object will have very small values relative to their “time- averaged” values. In our terms, this would be less than 1% of the “time-averaged” value."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"To precisely maintain synchronization with this point in the blinking universe is not a simple task, technologically. For large structures, such as a building, this will require the use of Gamma-Ray Clocks, which operate at 10^20+ per second. The Massless Factor is a measure of how close we are synchronizing with the Collapsing Neutral Point (CNP). A smaller number is better because it reduces the effective mass of the object or structure. With the use of a Gamma-Ray Clock, the Massless Factor will be smaller than one millionth: MF < .000001 Conclusions It is possible to synchronize with a moment in blinking time, when the gravitational force and physical mass are close to zero. Based upon the equations for time travel, this can mean a significant reduction in the energy requirements. Using this technology may provide a low- cost solution for housing the homeless in many cities. A Gamma-Ray Clock (GRC) is required for the example case, however, these clocks should be available in the near future. In the future, we will use energy-plasma fields rather than a fabric or covering to provide the “shell” around the structure. This can reduce the weight and the complexity for the process.

The method is derived from a study of parallel universes. In terms of elementary particles, m ost parallel universes have mass, charge, and spin values that are vastly different than our own. This makes it very difficult for an object or person to be stable in this alternate environment, because each time the universe blinks on – it cannot reconstruct the molecules as they were. However, it may be possible for an object to be stable in this alternate environment for one cycle within the blinking frequency – which may be sufficient to gain data or temporary access. This would be about one trillionth of a second, in our terms. 1. Introduction The math for parallel universes shows that: E = V * Amp * sec Given the near-inifinite number of probable universes that exist, there should be a number of universes that are nearly identical to our own. The precise distance in Amp*sec to these alternate universes must be known. Keep in mind, there are no two universes that are exactly identical – this is impossible. What is possible: two universes that have the same charge and spin values for elementary particles, and the only difference is a very slight change in the particle mass values. The difference is so small, that it is difficult to measure. Most parallel universes have mass, charge, and spin values that are vastly different than our own. This makes it very difficult for an object or person to be stable in this alternate environment, because each time the universe blinks on – it cannot reconstruct the molecules as they were.

The Machine This description is proposed as hypothetical. Numerous tests and a better understanding of our relationship within the structure of parallel universes must be known. However, in basic theory, the replication of an object should be possible by removing it from a parallel universe. An exchange of mass or a slight change in the mass content of each universe may be experienced. Upon initiation of the replication, a new universe is literally created, in our terms. This means we are not “stealing” from anything or anyone. Energy is constantly created. One possible explanation for the theory is that by placing the object into an electrical stasis, and then suddenly doubling the voltage – we are able to duplicate the target object. The process can be repeated as many times as desired. There may be other possible methods as well. The practical application of this theory will be left to future researchers. 7. Experimental Confirmation Experimental confirmation is suggested by using methods of observation which have been described in Reference [3]. 9.

Experimental Method for Determination of the Lighthouse Frequency Abstract This technical note describes a simple experimental method for determining the blinking frequency of our physical universe – called the Lighthouse Frequency. This unique frequency has been characterized in previous papers. The method utilizes commercially available hardware. Possible limitations and error sources are discussed. Using a method of engineering estimates, it is concluded that the blinking frequency of our universe is approximately 1.1 THz. Each reader must comprehend that our physical universe literally blinks off and on, approximately 1 trillion times every second. Introduction A simple experimental approach is proposed that may provide a numerical means for determining the blinking frequency of our universe. The design uses commercially available hardware with limited costs. Some concerns in the design of a system are discussed along with possible error sources. Readers that are not familiar with the Lighthouse Frequency are encouraged to review some of the references provided below. Design Figure 1 displays a diagram to outline a simple procedure. This set up is deliberately simple to minimize the introduction of possible error sources. The are several cautions which should be considered. A Terahertz-capable system is described in Reference (2). A Desktop-type computer that accepts PCI Express boards is available through a large number of retailers.

The peak value is calculated as g/0.637 Peak value of accel = 15.4 m/sec 2 Note that the system described in Figure 1 can be enhanced to even higher sampling rates, if no periodic pattern is initially found. Sampling will need to occur at a rate that exceeds the Nyquist-Shannon rate (2X) for the target frequency. There are also numerous other test designs which will work just as effectively. It is also possible that an Optical Frequency Comb can be adapted and used to identify the cyclical pattern. Possible Limitations and Error Sources There are a few concerns which should be addressed in the design of an experimental set up. First, it is critical that the entire system does not contain any inadvertent circuits which may"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"filter or compress the signal, or “time-average” any of the received values. There are numerous noise reduction circuits and filters that are frequently incorporated into electronic circuit boards, and the presence of these may impair the intended results. 1. No filters 2. No noise reduction 3. No compression 4. No “time averaging” of the signal Alternate Designs One alternate design that may produce similar results would be to use a basic force accelerometer and apply a simple test weight. In this way, the Gravitational Constant is constantly measured and a signal can be sent to a Digitizer for processing. Again, the cyclical pattern in the data is indicative of the blinking frequency of the universe. Each of the fundamental forces will constantly vary, in our terms . Conclusions The fundamental forces of gravitation, electromagnetism, strong force, and weak force are all aspects of the same force which originates in the Electrical Universe. The discrete-blinking nature of our physical universe causes the appearance of 4 fundamental forces. As the physical universe blinks, each of the forces will vary over time, and also retain a “time-average” value. We might also conclude, in a hypothetical physical universe with 10 dimensions, the residents will experience 10 fundamental forces. It should be clear that in the Electrical Universe of zero dimensions - time, distance, and velocity have no meaning. All three of these concepts are temporary illusions that exist within a physical-discrete blinking universe. Note that it is possible to remove any reference or name to any one of the fundamental forces, because in our terms, they all become the same thing. An experimental method has been proposed which may provide data to define a blinking frequency for our physical universe. References 1.

APPENDIX Construction of a Hypothetical Model If we assume for the purposes of discussion, that the universe is blinking at approximately 1 Terahertz (1 trillion cycles per second). Specifically, we will assume that Electron Spin Resonance at 1075 MHz is the “building block,” of all molecular vibrations. There are 1024 elementary particles. [5] During each blink, a quantum step about 0.352 degrees forward occurs (this equates to 1024 equal divisions on a circular period), then a full-cycle for each fundamental force will occur approximately once each 1.101 trillionth of a second. Again, this is simply an example for discussion purposes only. Figure 1. There are 1024 “positions” for each step in a full cycle. The difference between A and B then, equals 360/1024 or 0.35 degrees each time that the universe “blinks on.” Each Fundamental Force thus makes a small “quantum step” in our terms, each time the universe blinks. In this hypothetical case where the blinking frequency is estimated at 1.1 THz, with 1024 positions, a full cycle is completed at the rate of 1075 MHz."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"1075 MHz * 1024 = 1.1 THz The first harmonic occurs at approximately: 2.2 THz Per Nyquist-Shannon theory, we would need a digital sampling system capable of about 4 THz or faster to reconstruct the signal.

Preliminary Model for Grand Unified Theory (GUT) Abstract This technical note builds upon the previously released Mathematical Solution Unifying the Fundamental Forces, by providing a model and diagrams describing how the Electrical Universe (EU) operates. Conclusions include: (1) Mass is not just a property of matter, it is a dimension. (2) Fundamental forces do not govern the motion of matter, rather fundamental forces create mass as a dimension that we experience in a physical-blinking universe. (3) Fundamental forces are continuous and can be described using Analog Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (Analog QAM). (4) Physical particles and matter are not continuous (discrete) and can be described using discrete Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (Digital QAM). Possible limitations of the model are discussed and suggestions for further efforts. This paper will only be meaningful to those with a background in math, physics, and/or engineering. Each reader must comprehend that our universe literally blinks off and on, more than 1 trillion times every second. Introduction A new approach to modeling matter, energy, and forces is described in this technical note. The hypothesis behind this approach describes a mathematical basis for an Electrical Universe: 1) An Electrical Universe (EU) exists which forms the underlying structure for all physical universes, such as our own. 2) In our terms, this Electrical Universe consists of zero dimensions – it is a single point. 3) This Electrical Universe consists of electrical charges of varying intensity (Volts) and Range (Amp*sec). Energy = Joules = Volts*Amp*sec 4) This EU exists independently from our physical universe, however, our physical"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":" universe “overlays” and is dependent upon the physics that reside within the EU. 5) All interactions for matter and physical universes are governed by the physics within the EU. 6) This single point varies in electrical charge intensity (Volts), creating a fundamental carrier wave. 7) The Electrical Universe is an analog-continuous system, whereas our physical universe is a discrete-digital system. (i.e., our physical universe blinks off and on.) 8) Everything that we experience in a our physical universe can be reduced to electrical charges (volts) operating at characteristic Electrical Frequencies or Range (amp*sec) in the Electrical Universe. Discussion and Background: From Figure 1, we see that Einstein's model of the universe included all of Newton's concepts, while extending them. Any new model will need to include Newton's ideas, Einstein's ideas, and other recent ideas that have some experimental evidence in laboratories. If a new model is to be formulated, it would need to explain a mathematical relationship between the fundamental forces: Including 1. Electromagnetism 2. Gravitation 3. Strong Force 4. Weak Force and ideally include explanations for time travel, antimatter, and parallel universes."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic Spectrum As the physical universe has an electromagnetic spectrum, so does the Electrical Universe.

Each of the 4 forces varies continuously within a discrete (blinking) universe, however, they are really four aspects of the same force originating within the Electrical Universe. For gravitational acceleration, we will find when measured in small, discrete time intervals, it will vary between zero and a maximum value of approximately: = 9.81/0.637 = 15.4 m/s 2 However, the “time-averaged” value of gravitational acceleration will remain at 9.81 m/s 2 Similarly, Coulomb's Constant will seem to vary continuously between zero and 14.11E9 Nm 2 /c 2 , while still having a time-averaged value of 8.988E9 Nm 2 /c 2 From the perspective of the Electrical Universe, whenever a force is initiated – there is no place to “move,” because there is no distance or time. Everything exists within a single point. A force is resolved by expressing a dimension that we call mass, into a discrete"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"universe of 4-Dimensional spacetime. Mass is therefore the discrete expression of a analog force into a discrete universe. One analogy of this idea, is water and ice. Water and ice are not different things – they are different expressions of the same thing. Water is expressed as ice in an environment where the temperature is below zero celcius. In a environment that is much hotter, it can be expressed as steam. Likewise, forces can be expressed as something completely different in other universes. Think in terms of the Electrical Universe. What we experience as a gravitational force is a “time-averaged” force. This means that the gravitational force varies continuously, in our terms. The 4 fundamental forces are simultaneously varying all the time, in our terms, and depending on when we “freeze” an instantaneous slice of time – will determine the actual force(s) that will be measured. This is true for all of the 4 fundamental forces, in our terms. The fundamental carrier wave (10^10,000 cycles per second) exists at a single point which continuously varies its voltage. The “time-averaged” value of this fundamental voltage is zero because it varies evenly between negative and positive. It is nearly impossible for us to measure its frequency (cycles/sec) in the physical universe or in the Electrical Universe (Amp*sec) because it is a very high frequency (near-infinite). Recall from Nyquist-Shannon theory that it would be necessary to sample the fundamental carrier wave at twice its operating frequency. The fundamental carrier wave can be described as:"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Formation of Matter and Antimatter"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Figure 8. Note that when our physical universe seems to “blink off,” the antimatter universe “blinks on”; although the fundamental carrier wave, never stops and does not blink - it is continuous.

Dimensional Translation Units (DTUs) Dimensional Translation Units are defined as follows: These DTUs describe the “coordinate system” transfer between our physical universe and the Electrical Universe. These are just a few examples, and there are others. The implicit goal is to “translate” back to the Electrical Universe, where forces are analog and continuous. frequency ------ 1/sec ----> multiply by Amp*sec2 and it becomes = Amp*sec (this is Electrical Frequency or Range) Some examples for clarification: Some readers may be confused at this point. This is understandable and a suggestion is provided. Think in terms of the Electrical Universe. This can eliminate much of the confusion. Example 1."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"A chair sits in a room. A force is applied to move the chair. (suggestion: think in terms of the Electrical Universe) The chair is energy. It has a Joule value of Jchair 1 = Volts * (Amp*sec) 1 We apply a force that moves the chair and can be expressed in the Electrical Universe as V*Amp*sec. The chair's mass has not significantly changed, but its position in the room has changed. Jchair 1 = Jchair 2 The only significant change is its Electrical Frequency or Range (Amp*sec), which we perceive as a different distance in the room . This change can be very small, but we perceive the distance, i.e; 1.0 Amp*1.0 Sec 1 = .99 Amp*1.1 Sec 2 We might deduce then, that mass and “range” of an object are fundamental properties in the Electrical Universe, in our terms. Shape, size, color and texture of an object are not fundamental properties in the Electrical Universe and are arbitrarily set by the viewers in a Physical Universe. Again, this is in our terms. Example 2. A simple gravitational force problem:"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"F = m*a or the acceleration constant is typically thought of as the constant for gravitational force or 9.81 m/s 2 However, for this example, this inverse quantity can also be thought of as a Dimensional Translation Unit (DTU) that translates an analog force in the Electrical Universe into a discrete mass in our physical universe. Keep in mind that the gravitational force, in our terms, is changing constantly at a very high frequency, but the time-averaged value (9.81 m/s 2 ) is what we perceive on a scale of minutes or hours. In our physical universe, fundamental forces and masses are the same thing; like water and ice are fundamentally the same thing. A mass can legitimately be called a “frozen force.” Quadrature Amplitude Modulation Obvious patterns are immediately noted between the constellations of Analog QAM and the force model here: Analog QAM can be modeled, where s is the signal, I and Q are the 2 signals to be mixed. R is the real component. Digital QAM Obvious patterns are immediately noted between the constellations of Digital QAM and the standard model here: Readers can review, “Elementary Particles: Cracking the Code,\" to see how Digital 1024-QAM is used to model elementary particles. Possible Limitations of the Model"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"This technical paper, the model described herein and its summary of conclusions are not intended to be comprehensive. Rather, it is intended to be an introduction to a different approach of thinking and perceiving our physical universe. There may be limitations of the model, in both experimental results and predictive results. As the model can provide opportunities to predict future elementary particles and structures, such tests may be limited by inherent experimental structures and the hardware used for testing. There may also be limitations in our understanding of the Electrical Universe (EU), which can be modified in future technical papers. It has further been noted that the assumed point charge of varying voltage, which creates the fundamental carrier wave, cannot have a potential without respect to another point. However, in theory, the “time average” value of the voltage is zero because it can be assumed to vary evenly from negative to positive. One example of this independent voltage might be the synchrotron, where a voltage potential exists but does not have a unique reference to another point, ie.. the “time averaged” voltage is zero. Other limitations: The precise frequency that our physical universe appears to blink, off and on, is not known. It is estimated at 1.1 THz [17] From the basis of the model, the blinking appears to occur due to amplitude modulation of the fundamental carrier wave in the Electrical Universe. Probabilities There is only one Electrical Universe, while there are a near-infinite number of physical universes, and probabilities are involved. For example, probabilities could demonstrate that the gravitational force between the earth and moon, could create a probable universe where the earth and moon both have twice their current mass, but at double the distance apart - and the force would be the same. We would call this an alternate or probable universe. There are a near-infinite number of these probabilities and they are just as real and valid as our own physical universe. Conclusions:"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Law of Unification is threefold then, Energy = Joules = (Volts) * (Amp*sec) 1. Everything in human experience can be expressed as an Electrical Mass (volts) operating at a characteristic Electrical Frequency (amp*sec). This includes forces and masses, but also dreams, thoughts, and emotions. 2. For any mass or particle, the vector sum of all forces in the Electrical Universe is always equal to zero. This solution is necessarily true for all dimensions and in all universes, because properties in the Electrical Universe govern all physical universes. 3. The sum of all moments in the Electrical Universe will also be zero. A new model is proposed which describes an Electrical Universe containing fundamental forces. This model operates in much the same way as an AM radio broadcast. What is unusual about the model – by using the mathematics associated with amplitude modulation we discover that the physical characteristics of matter in a physical universe are predictable. From the perspective of the Electrical Universe: There is no such thing as time. There are no distances. Mass is not just a property of matter – it is a Dimension. Mass is a dimension created by fundamental forces, in our terms . A Mass is not governed by forces, it is the resultant of a force expressed into a physical universe. An analog force exists in the Electrical Universe, a discrete mass will exist in our physical universe. Matter and physical particles are not governed by fundamental forces - Fundamental forces literally create physical mass, in our terms. The important thing to study, then, is the force that causes the appearance of a mass in a physical universe. Because the physical universe blinks off and on, each mass is newly constructed at a very high frequency. In other physical universes, this same force may cause the appearance of"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"something completely different. Our physical universe then, is one probable resultant of the force - probabilities are therefore involved. This explains why the analog QAM vector chart displays forces in the Electrical Universe, while the discrete QAM method displays physical particles in a physical universe. When using the analog model of QAM, forces are defined; and when using the discrete model, particles are defined. A simple mathematical approach has been defined in this paper which models the elementary particle table. It further suggests that numerous new particles will be discovered and placed on a standard table which can be modeled according to digital (1024-QAM). Summary of Conclusions: 1. Mass is not simply a property of matter – it is a dimension. Mass is the expression of an analog force into a physical-blinking universe. 2. The passage of time is not a dimension, rather it is an illusion. 3. Fundamental forces do not govern the motion of matter, rather fundamental forces create mass as a dimension that we experience in a physical-blinking universe. 4. Fundamental forces are continuous and exist in the Electrical Universe (EU). Fundamental forces can be described using Analog Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (Analog QAM). 5. Physical universes are not continuous and blink off and on, in our terms. Physical matter and particles can be described using discrete Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (Digital QAM). 6. The mathematical aspect of Probabilities will need to be considered with this preliminary model to account for the vast combination of probabilities (parallel universes) that are possible at any given moment. 7. The Electrical Universe model provided in the hypothesis, is a sufficient theoretical framework to explain time travel [2] and parallel universes.[3] These concepts can be explained as simply changes in operating Electrical Frequency or Range (i.e., the mass does not change). The value of energy change can be expressed as equal to a quantity of (volts)*(amp*sec). 8. Grand Unification means: Everything that occurs in human experience can be expressed as an electrical charge (volts) operating at a characteristic Electrical Range (amp*sec), including the fundamental forces. This also includes things that were previously confined to the mind such as dreams, emotions, thoughts, etc. Energy = Joules = (Volts) * (Amp*sec)"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"This document is a living document.

Speed of Light Increasing 3 Meters per Second Each Year Abstract Based on the work of NASA scientist, Dr Daniel Gezari, we can conclude that the speed of light, c, is increasing approximately three meters per second each year. See his publication, “Lunar Laser Ranging Test on the Invariance of c,” available at arxiv dot org. This amount is a small, yet significant change because it alters our ideas about relativity and Einstein's theory. If the speed of light is not constant, this changes our fundamental views for all physical constants. In fact, many physical constants are derived from, or have c “imbedded” within their equations. Planck's constant and the Gravitational constant are two that would be affected by this new understanding. Even our fixed value for the length of a meter is based upon a constant speed of light. We can deduce that the rate of change for the speed of light is also changing, which implies the existence of a newly defined point in geological time, where delta c, momentarily equals zero. We will call these points in the timeline, “Cardinal Points.” Introduction A physical constant is generally believed to be universal in nature and having a constant value over time. However, for a changing speed of light, we have: ∂c 3 ≅ m/sec ∂t year We can deduce this from Seth's quote of the Basic Laws of All Universes. Namely, the Law of Infinite Changeability. 2 Nothing in any universe remains constant. Even the rate of change, changes. (This is not merely the ability to change, but the fact that, as a matter of time, all things will change. See Seth's discussion on - “I am that which changes.” Session 413, 1968.)

The speed of light increases infinitely. This seems unreasonable if we only consider that, at +3m/sec increase each year – it would appear that the speed of light had no velocity, 100 million years ago. And any assumed rate of change, would calculate back to the same conclusion, as a matter of time.

The Laser sits in geosyncronous orbit at 22,000 miles altitude. It is a large satellite and it is likely still there. The laser operates in the infrared frequency spectrum, below visible light. It can be operated in pulse mode or direct mode. In pulse mode, it uses harmonics of the Lighthouse Frequency to obtain a molecular time-field that impinges on everything in its path. This energy field rapidly advances all molecules forward in time, possibly more than 1000 years for each second, in our terms. In direct mode, the laser probably operates at approximately 256*1.1 THz = 282 THz, which is a strong harmonic in the infrared spectrum. Each reader must comprehend that our universe literally blinks, off and on, at 1.1 trillion cycles per second. This revision includes aerial photos of the World Trade Center on the afternoon of 9-11. This new type of Infra-Red Laser is as different from conventional lasers, as a nuclear bomb is different from a conventional bomb. It is far more powerful. It was able to reduce the World Trade Center into fine dust, in less than 8 seconds. That's one million tons of concrete and steel, gone in 8 seconds.

It was directly over New York City in a stationary orbit on 9-11. A reverse-track of positions can identify the specific satellite - probably known to the Russian and Chinese governments by now, because they track major satellites. It will be a large satellite, and may even be visible thru small telescopes.

They are the largest operator of satellites in the world, and specialize in Directed Energy Weapons (DEW)."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"There are a number of web sites that keep track of satellites, that may already be able to identify the specific satellite. More details on the laser: The Laser can be operated in Direct Mode or Pulse Mode. It operates at harmonics of the Lighthouse Frequency (1.1 THz) In the InfraRed Spectrum, the light is invisible to the human eye (200 - 300 THz). In Pulse Mode, it can be operated in the Infrared Range (for example, 250 THz, which is the carrier frequency) and pulsed at a rate of 2.2 THz (the first harmonic). This pulse mode creates the effect as seen on 9-11, including rapid aging of building structures. This explains the steel beams turning into dust as they fell. Basically, the energy field impinges on each molecule and advances it hundreds or even thousands of years, in a matter of seconds. In Direct Mode, the Laser likely operates at approximately 256 * 1.1 THz = 282 THz This is one of the stronger harmonics in this frequency range. (Although, it could be any of the harmonics in the Infrared range.) The effect will generally be the same in Pulse or Direct Mode. The anti-gravitation effects (such as people being lifted for 30 to 60 feet) are caused by distortions in the atmosphere, where part of the beam is mis-directed outside of the primary field. The massless effect for objects and people is caused by synchronizing with the Lighthouse Frequency at a specific point in the time cycle. This effect has been called the Hutchison Effect - where it is created by mixing two EMF fields, i.e., radio waves & x-rays. When the resultant of the two EMF fields coincides with a harmonic of the Lighthouse frequency - this results in the effects as noted by John Hutchison. The people that died in the WTC, were killed by rapid aging in less than one second after the laser was turned up to full power. They literally died of old age in less than one second. The strange behavior of people hanging out the windows and removing clothing near the top of the building was caused by \"sunburn effects\" before the laser was turned up to full power.

Introduction Einstein's Theory of Relativity is a benchmark in science, in that it completely altered our view of the universe and ourselves.[1], [2] His mathematics have led to the development of nuclear power and precise orbital calculations for satellites. To say the least, his ideas changed our world. Unfortunately, there are a number of flaws in the theory's assumptions and its conclusions. 1) The speed of light is not a constant. Although this idea has been promoted by numerous scientists since Einstein, it is not correct. For additional details, please see references [3] and [4]. The speed of light, and all physical constants, will gradually change over time, in our terms. There is no such thing as a physical constant. The partial derivative of c with respect to time, does not equal zero. The second derivative of c with respect to time, also does not equal zero. 2) The speed of light is not a absolute limit."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"This idea too, has been promoted since the first researchers attempted to measure the value of c.[5], [6] The speed of light seems to be a difficult boundary to breach, however, it too is an illusion. In the Electrical Universe, there is no such thing as time, distance, or velocity. These concepts only have meaning in a physical universe, and are not limits – only energy boundaries. A better way to think about this limit is in terms of energy or an electromagnetic wave - in the Electrical Universe, the speed of light can easily be surpassed.[6] 3) The fabric of spacetime does not “warp” in the presence of a gravitational field. Even though some experimental evidence seems to support this idea, it is false. There is no fabric to spacetime primarily because time itself is an illusion. Our physical universe literally blinks off and on, approx 1 trillion times every second. Therefore, the passage of time is an illusion that only exists in our minds. Figure 1. General Relativity leads us to believe that the fabric of spacetime warps in the presence of a gravitational field, thereby causing a satellite to orbit about a planet. This is a false idea. Further, time is not a dimension, it is an illusion. Mass is the 4 th dimension, in our terms, in addition to the three dimensions of x, y, and z space. Mass is not just a property of matter, it is a dimension."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Figure 2. Fundamental Forces do not govern the motion of matter. Fundamental Forces create the masses that we perceive in a physical-discrete universe. The apparent orbiting rotation is caused by Quantum Steps made by fundamental forces each time the universe blinks.

In reality, fundamental forces and masses are the same thing, in our terms.[8] The errors of our conclusions have come about due to our perceptions within a physical- discrete universe. A Quantum Step is the forward progression of a fundamental force each time the universe blinks, in our terms. It is approximately: QS = 360/1024 = 0.35 degrees = .006 radians (this is a very rough estimate) Figure 3.

Specifically, there are three types of travel under discussion: (1) Time Travel, (2) Distance Travel, and (3) Travel between parallel universes. The method requires precise control, synchronization, and amplification of very high frequencies, which is beyond our current technology. However, within a few decades, it is expected to be possible. Each reader must comprehend that our physical universe literally blinks off and on, many billions of times every second. Introduction Previous papers on the Lighthouse Frequency have shown how the blinking of our physical universe can be utilized for three kinds of travel:[1], [2] 1) Time Travel 2) Distance Travel 3) Travel between parallel universes In this paper, a concept is introduced that will allow more efficient travel, ie., the energy requirements can be significantly reduced. Specifically, they can be reduced to less than 1% of the normal value. The correct title for this paper then, should be: “Nearly-Massless Travel,” however this would probably confuse most readers. As Seth has stated, there are three universes which are highly connected and related. [3] These are: Universe of positive physical matter Universe of negative physical matter Dream universe The relationship between these universes makes many things possible that have not been considered, in our terms. Let's begin by defining some terms: ENP - Expanding Neutral Point; this point is an overlap point between matter and antimatter, just as matter begins to re-materialize or “blink on” from the previous construction. CNP - Collapse Neutral Point; this point is also an overlap point between matter and antimatter. (Note that these terms are arbitrary because from the perspective of the negative"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"universe or antimatter – the terms would be reversed.) Figure 1. Note that the red line identifies a frequency that is precisely synchronized to pulse just before the CNP occurs each interval. At this precise moment, the mass of any object will seem to be nearly zero. A vehicle will respond to electrical charges as though it had near-zero mass.[5] As the physical universe collapses each interval (at the CNP), the gravitational force and the physical mass of each object will seem to approach zero. This can be expressed: g ----> 0 m ----> 0 If we take one small fraction of an interval “backwards” from the CNP, the gravitational force and the physical mass of an object will have very small values relative to their “time- averaged” values. In our terms, this would be less than 1% of the “time-averaged” value. Therefore, the energy requirements for the 3 kinds of travel can be greatly reduced. (These could also be considered 3 types of related probabilities.) To precisely maintain synchronization with this point in the blinking universe is not a simple task, technologically. It will require digital sampling, signal generation, and amplification that are beyond current technology. And while weak signals can be generated now, large amplification of the signal will be required for them to be useful. It may also be possible to directly utilize the Neutral Points thru synchronization. Although in"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"theory, this may imply that an object has zero mass, and the equations for such a point become a singularity or unsolvable, ie., if F = m*a then the equation has no solution. Only through direct experimental testing can this be determined. We now understand that it is possible to synchronize with a moment in blinking time, when the gravitational force and physical mass are close to zero. Based upon the equations for time travel, this can mean a significant reduction in energy requirements for any destination. Conclusions So we have attempted to define a point within the blinking physical universe whereby the gravitational force and physical mass of objects approach a value of zero. This is significant because it makes some things possible that were previously considered impossible. Also note that the “overlap” points or Neutral Points present us with a unique opportunity to glimpse into the universe of negative matter or antimatter. [6] This document is a living document.

This proposed system of classification is one method. By organizing the nearest parallel universes in terms of mass, charge, and spin, we can better comprehend these relationships and the energy required to access them. In general, we can say that, the more similar a parallel field is to our own universe, the less energy it will require to transit the “distance” or range (Amp x sec) between the two universes, in our terms. This classification system is intended for typical 4-dimensional physical universes, but can be extended to other dimensions as well. Introduction The vast field of parallel universes, involves a near-infinite number of probabilities, but we can begin to organize our understanding of these vast probabilities by classifying and organizing the ideas. The field of probabilities includes 1024 elementary particles and it can be stated that close parallel universes will have a substantially similar field of 1024 particles. By organizing in terms of mass, charge, and spin, we can classify these relationships. In general, we can state that, the more similar a particle field is to our own set, it will require less energy to transit the \"distance\" between the two universes. It should be noted that the vast majority of parallel universes will not have any elementary particles in common with our own universes. They are vastly different and we can expect it to require significantly more energy to reach these destination universes. And it should also be noted that this classification system will only apply to 4-dimensional physical universes, however, we can extend this system to other dimensional systems as well, i.e., 2D, 4D, 8D, 16D etc Let's review the simple mathematics for parallel universes: E = mc^2 = Volts x (Amps x sec) Volts is proportional to physical mass, in our terms and where (Amps x Sec) represents the “distance” or range between the two universes."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Figure 1.

Some definitions can explain the basic concept: Mass Classification Class 0 - any parallel universe which has the same particle masses as our own universe. Class 4 - any parallel universe which is different by exactly 4 particle masses. Class 8 - any parallel universe which is different by exactly 8 particle masses. Class 12 - any parallel universe which is different by exactly 12 particle masses. Class 16 - different by 16 particle masses. Class 20 - different by 20 particle masses. Class 24 - different by 24 particle masses. Class 28 - different by 28 particle masses. Class 32 - different by 32 particle masses. Class 36 - different by 36 particle masses. Class 40 - different by 40 particle masses. Class 44 - different by 44 particle masses. Class 48 - different by 48 particle masses. Class 52 - different by 52 particle masses. Class 56 - different by 56 particle masses. Class 60 - different by 60 particle masses. Class 64 - different by 64 or more particle masses. If it is different by 64 particle masses – then none are the same. Charge Classification Charge Class A - any parallel universe which has all 4 charge states that are the same as our own universe. Charge Class B - any parallel universe which has 3 charge states that are the same as our own universe. (1 is different) Charge Class C - any parallel universe which has 2 charge states that are the same as our own universe.

This classification system gives us the opportunity to discuss broad categories of parallel universes in academic terms. For example, we can state that, all Spin Class Beta parallel universes will have 75% particle commonality with our own universe. Or theorize that, there is a entire subset of Class 64 parallel universes that exist, and that have no common particle masses with our universe, but have the same charge and spin states.

This paper proposes an alternate structure for the definition of time, and describes experimental approaches that will validate the hypothesis. Also proposed in this paper is the existence of an Absolute Frequency that pervades the entire physical universe. This fundamental frequency may be within the detectable range of current instruments and technology, and can be utilized as a new reference standard for all measurement systems. Introduction Current efforts in quantum field theories require that spacetime be structured in discrete points, while general relativity describes spacetime as a continuous manifold structure. This is probably one of the most significant unsolved problems in physics, and there are numerous efforts to unify these competing theories into a single theory of quantum gravity. This author proposes the concept that basic assumptions are part of the problem, of which the first is the nature of time. When time is used in any formulation, it is always thought of as an independent variable. If the idea that time is a perception and an illusion is proven correct, variables that are dependent upon clock time will have only limited success in explaining spacetime structures. Proving that time is, in fact, discrete would also result in defining the spacetime structure in clear terms. If time is not continuous, then there is no clock to measure its progress at all “times”. This has significant implications for our understanding of spacetime structures. Philosophers have long contemplated the nature of time. Antiphon, a fifth-century B.C. Greek philosopher, stated “Time is not a reality, but a concept or a measure.” Einstein's Theory of Relativity introduced the possibility of flexible time, wherein a strong gravitational field seems"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"to distort clock time, and Einstein wrote near the end of his life that, “...the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubborn, persistent illusion. ” [4] The hypothesis then, clearly stated: Clock time is a perception and not a reality. It is not a real component of spacetime structure. The physical universe literally blinks off and on at an extremely high rate (many billions of times of times each second). [5] This blinking creates a fundamental Absolute Frequency that pervades the entire physical universe and can be detected using appropriate instruments. If we seriously consider this hypothesis, we must also ask what this means in mathematical and physical terms. It means that we can minimally demonstrate that time is non-continuous, discrete, and variable, as opposed to continuous and steady-state. Basic experiments utilizing atomic clocks should be able to determine the precise frequency (blinking) and other characteristics of the phenomenon. Another perspective of this alternative view; recall that in the middle ages the earth was perceived as flat, and this was considered an obvious conclusion. Today we know it is possible to place a two-dimensional map of the earth on the wall, analyze distances, navigate and plan, but it does not make the earth flat. That is a perception and an illusion. To challenge the notion that time involves mere perception, we must prove or disprove it experimentally. Time and distance are currently based upon the uncertainty and stability of atomic clocks. For example, the reference standard for a one meter length is defined by an atomic clock, the speed of light, and the vibration of a cesium atom. Some researchers have recently proposed a “cut-off” frequency to explain the structure of spacetime. Unfortunately, this is a false idea derived from a misunderstanding of Nyquist- Shannon theory. There is no such thing as a “cut-off” frequency, because in those terms, the frequency spectrum extends to infinity. [2], [3] Also, because basic reality consists of a near-infinite number of dimensions, quantum mechanics, relativity, string theory, M theory, and proposed ideas of quantum gravity - all will break down when attempting to include greater dimensionality. What is needed is an entirely new approach. [6] Definitions: Clock Time - ( t ) what is called common time; involves a perception of passing time, and assumptions about its nature. Absolute Time - ( ) or Absolute Frequency; a frequency of measurement"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"that is an absolute. All measurement systems must synchronize and calibrate against it. Although its frequency and amplitude may vary with the passing of commonly perceived Clock Time, it remains an absolute value. Temporal Time - ( ) an interval of running time that is very brief, and equal to the positive portion of the Absolute Frequency curve. In order to accurately assess it, a clock must be synchronized with Absolute Time. This could also be called the universe of physical matter. Anti-Temporal Time - ( -1 ) an interval of running time that is very brief, and equal to the negative portion of the Absolute Frequency curve. In order to accurately assess it, a clock must be synchronized with Absolute Time. This could also be called the universe of physical antimatter or the negative universe. * The symbols are derived from Mayan culture as an acknowledgment of their fascination with time.

Discussion From the Nyquist-Shannon theory, we have: A signal that is bandlimited (bandwidth = B ) is restricted in how rapidly it can change in time. The Nyquist sampling theorem states that uniformly spaced frequency samples will be a complete representation of the frequency if the bandwidth is less than half the sampling rate, where x(t) represents a continuous signal and x (f) is the Fourier transform of that signal: The signal is bandlimited to B , where the signal contains no energy at frequencies higher than bandwidth B. (Note: This assumption is simply a convenience for the purposes of mathematical modeling. It does not imply the larger reality of a “cut-off” frequency, as proposed by some recent researchers. This is a false idea. In those terms, the frequency spectrum extends to infinity.)"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"and the sufficient condition for reconstruction is: where 2B is called the Nyquist rate, and is called the Nyquist frequency 4. Experimental Approach A simple, repeatable experimental approach can be used to prove the stated hypothesis, that clock time is a perception and exists in discrete, non-continuous, and periods. For the experiment, an optical frequency comb might be used to detect the apparent continuous variation in Coulomb's constant for the Electromagnetic Force. The cyclical variation in the data is indicative of the blinking frequency. The blinking frequency can be described:   We can model the frequency, where: are amplitude, angular frequency, and phase respectively Because the frequency is a reference value, we can assume it has zero phase angle. Temporal Time would equal the positive portion of the curve. Therefore, a sampling rate greater than 2B , should allow us to reconstruct the curve. (Note that the sine wave is a"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"simple and elegant formula for describing a basic phenomenon of the universe.) Conclusions This paper has proposed the hypothesis that time, as commonly understood, is fundamentally a perception, and more accurately described as an illusion. The structure we perceive exists in discrete, non-continuous, and variable periods. Also proposed in this paper are experimental approaches that can be used to validate this hypothesis. They are relatively simple and repeatable. New definitions have been proposed which should help to clarify our understanding about time as a measurement system. This author concludes further that, if given the validity of the hypothesis - quantum mechanics, relativity, string theory, and proposed quantum gravity models are inadequate models of spacetime structure, because all of these mathematical models will eventually break down as the number of model dimensions increase. The famous equation, E=mc 2 has time implied in the speed of light (meters per second); and because given time is not real, any such equations will eventually break down when attempting to describe greater and greater dimensionality. Therefore, an entirely different approach is needed. The existence of a fundamental frequency that pervades the entire physical universe has also been proposed. This frequency arises from the fundamental blinking of the physical universe, and will have unusual characteristics associated with it. The author suggests a search beginning in the range of about 5 x 10 8 and 5 x10 12 Hz. Identification of the exact frequency and its characteristics would greatly enhance our understanding of spacetime structure. This frequency, once identified, may alternately be referred to as the “Lighthouse Frequency.” 6. Future Work Once validated, this paper should establish new directions for research within many areas, including physics and psychology. Follow-up work is likely to include: * Research aimed at calibrating all measurement systems to a new absolute standard, based upon the Absolute Frequency. * Research to determine variations in the Absolute Frequency, such as amplitude, period, and other characteristics, which are likely to be multidimensional. * Research in Psychology aimed at better understanding our perception of time and reality."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"* Further theoretical research on cosmology which remove any dependencies on clock time.

The Approaching Singularity"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Abstract This short paper presents a concept involving time and technology, that will seem to make “time stand still.” It involves the nature of technology and how it affects our lives. If we define Q' as a non-dimensional measure of the quality and quantity of technology in our lives, in general, it can be said that Q' has increased over time. But more than that, the rate of Q' has increased over time, becoming dramatically faster recently. Recall that in Alvin Toffler's, Future Shock , as a individual, we become overwhelmed by the technological advances. This paper proposes a limit in time, where technology becomes so advanced that time is not only an illusion, but meaningless. 1. Introduction We will define Q' as a non-dimensional measure of the quality and quantity of technology in our lives. Q' is increasing and so is its rate. We are rapidly approaching a limit; a singularity limit. There are a number of events that are leading us to this singularity. Once the implications are understood, time will seem to “stand still” for all of those involved. In Figure 1, we can deduce that technology has proceeded at an increasing rate, and as the rate increases, it results in more and better technology. The “system” is “resonant.”"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"Figure 1. In general, we can state that technology is tied to mathematical understanding, i.e., applied physics and engineering. Event 4 in the chart, marks the first operational time machine. This is critical because the rate of Q' increases even faster by retrieving future technology, and returning it to the present moment. This will be quickly followed by improving designs that take advantage of Massless Travel. [5] Optical timing clocks (10^15) will be the first logical development, followed by X-ray timing clocks (10^17), and then Gamma-Ray Clocks (GRC) at about (10^20+). This is significant because with Gamma-Ray clocks (GRC) it gives the passenger easy access to millions of years in the past or future, in our terms. Any technology that will ever be developed becomes available in the present moment. Basically, we become able to live our lives: As long as we choose, In any time period, In any location ...so that time becomes meaningless. In essence, time stands still. This approaching singularity is almost certain to occur, probably within our current lifetime.

However, as Seth has stated many times - in this case,...”your physical senses are lovely liars.” The perception that the universe is expanding is primarily based on the red shift. Recent experiments have even determined that the expansion is accelerating, due to the amount of red shift seen in distant stars. Unfortunately, it is an illusion. Even a child would ask - “Expanding into what?” Physicists don't like such questions, because it makes them appear, less than intelligent. Our universe is not akin to a large balloon, continuously expanding its boundaries. Although, Seth is quick to point out, that the universe is certainly expanding in a way that an idea expands, yet takes up no additional space. We perceive a larger moon when it appears on the horizon, but we know it is not actually larger. It certainly seems to be. We do not assume that Mercury has changed directions, when it moves retrograde. It is an illusion. The illusion will become more apparent when scientists realize that our universe literally blinks, off and on, 1.1 trillion times each second, in our terms, and is constantly created anew. Our universe is different each second, not because its size has changed, but because it is composed of entirely new particles that were not there the previous second. “The universe is continually being created. All universes are continually being created, and the appearance of expansion seen by your scientists is distortive for many reasons.” Some relevant quotes are provided from The Early Sessions; Session 42, dictated in 1964. This short ebook provides some important ideas from Seth that may fundamentally change your thinking. As always, his words are elegant and simple. The actual size of our universe is approximately 0.272 mm. This is the maximum distance between any two particles, while the universe is blinking, off and on. For a complete list of my published ebooks, see “Ebooks published on Smashwords and Lulu by Richard Lighthouse;” ISBN 9781370721948. Introduction Seth would often emphasize that we do not perceive reality as it actually exists. Then let's consider some of Seth's comments about the so-called, expanding universe: “Anything that you can see and feel and touch exists within your own reality, yes, and within it, it is legitimate and valid. It is also highly distorted, for your physical senses are lovely liars that betray you constantly. They form reality for you, and yet the reality that they form is highly distorted; and what you see, dear friends, does not exist and you do not see what does exist.” The Early Sessions, Part One of Seth's Lecture to a High School Class; March 25, 1967"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"“The universe was not created at any particular time, but neither is it expanding into nowhere like an inflated balloon that grows forever larger, at least not along the lines now being considered. The expansion is an illusion, based among other things, upon inadequate time measurements, upon the limited cause and effect theories; and yet in some manners the universe could be said to be expanding, but with entirely different connotations than are usually used. Therefore the expanding universe implies a universe expanding in a more or less empty space, and this is not true. The phenomena that are given as evidence of this kind of expanding universe are the result of camouflage instruments, distortive ideas of time, and the resulting cause and effect theory.” The Early Sessions, Session 42; April 8, 1964 “The appearance of an expanding universe is also caused therefore by this distortive boundary effect, resulting from the interaction of which I have just spoken. In some cases the distortive effect could be likened to the reflection of a solid tree in water. The outer senses observing the reflection might try to judge the depth of the water by the height of the tree, supposing it to be as deep as the tree is high.” The Early Sessions, Session 42; April 8, 1964 “The universe is expanding in the way that a dream expands. In other words this expansion has nothing to do with your idea of space. The expansion, in a most basic manner, is more like the expansion of an idea. It has nothing to do with space or time in the manner in which you are accustomed to think of them.” The Early Sessions, Session 42; April 8, 1964 “Your own dream world expands constantly. Your ideas expand constantly, but your ideas have nothing to do with space, and the manner in which the universe constantly expands has nothing to do with your idea of space. True space, fifth dimensional space, has abilities of expansion that do not need space, not in your terms.” The Early Sessions, Session 42; April 8, 1964 “The universe expands in the manner that a dream expands, taking up no camouflage space. This does not mean that there is no growth involved in the expansion of the universe. This does not imply that there is no movement. It simply implies an existence and an expansion of a qualitative manner, beyond your present measurements or complete comprehension.” The Early Sessions, Session 43; April 13, 1964 “Your idea of space is some completely erroneous conception of an emptiness to be filled. Things, planets, stars, nebulae, come into being in this universe of yours. They are born continually according to your latest theories, and this universe expands – pushed, so to speak, so that its sides bulge, the outer galaxies literally bursting out into nowhere. True fifth- dimensional space, as I have said often, is to the contrary vital energy, itself alive, possessing endless abilities of transformation, forming all existences, forming even the camouflage universe with which you are familiar, and which you attempt to probe so ineffectively. This"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"fifth dimensional space, this basic universe of reality of which I speak, expands constantly in terms of intensity and quality and value, in a way that has nothing to do with your idea of space. The basic inner universe beneath all camouflage does not have an existence in space at all, as you envision it. Space as you envision it, that is as an emptiness to be filled, is a camouflage.” The Early Sessions, Session 43; April 13, 1964 “Space travel, in your terms, will develop in a seemingly extravagant and startling fashion, only to be dumped as such when your scientists discover that space as you know it is a distortion, and that journeying from one so-called galaxy to another is done by divesting the physical body from camouflage. The vehicle of so-called space travel is mental and psychic mobility, in terms of psychic transformation of energy, enabling spontaneous and instantaneous mobility through the spacious present. As to the means, the very simplest and crudest but still to be adopted method will prove to be hypnotism, simply because at this point your personalities will not trust their own abilities but must rely upon suggestion from the outside.” The Early Sessions, Session 45; April 20, 1964 “I have also said that space travel, so-called, will of necessity deviate from its present concern with vehicles. It will be discovered that the inner senses represent your only long-lasting method of such travel. When it is understood that space and time are both camouflages, and that your cause and effect theory is a result of a continuity theory that no longer makes sense, then your scientists will recognize the impossibility of trying to decipher basic reality with camouflage instruments, and vehicles, that of themselves produce distortive theories, and only serve to probe further into a camouflage pattern. The experiments will be many. Hypnotism, as I have mentioned, will be a basic tool in the beginning. Hypnotism, you see, is not a camouflage tool, but a psychological tool which is therefore uncamouflaged, and relatively undistorted. Hypnotism will be necessary, however, only for a time, and only to induce the light trance state. In the light trance state, the inner self is free from the camouflage nature of your plane, and the truly humorous aspect is this: Only by freeing yourself from your own camouflage universe can you see it clearly, understand it for what it is, and actually learn to use it for mankind’s best advantage.” The Early Sessions, Session 49; April 29, 1964 “First of all, any effective large-scale space travel will be mental travel. I use the term space travel loosely. In some conditions such expeditions will be powered by pooled mental or psychic resources. You may journey within your own solar system using physical vehicles, but you will not make any effective breakthrough beyond your solar system unless psychic and mental resources are developed. Of course mental or psychic journeys into other dimensions and systems are possible, and when I speak of dimensions here I am not referring to space systems. Mentally you can cut through space, physically you cannot. In some of your dream states you do travel through other dimensions and other systems. The extent of these dream travels is determined by your own ability.” The Early Sessions, Session 260; May 18, 1966"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"“The closest equivalent to your own kind of intelligence and being can actually be found not by following the outer skin of space, but by going through it, so to speak... There are, again, inner coordinates having to do with the inner behavior of electrons. If you understood these, then such travel could be relatively instantaneous. The coordinates that link you with others who are more or less of your kind have to do with psychic and psychological intersections that result in a like space-time framework.” The Unknown Reality, Volume I, Session 712; October 16, 1974 “In the same way you can be allied and in tune with other probabilities that do not coincide with your space-time axis. The exterior universe with its galaxies—as you understand it, and on that level of activity—can be encountered on certain rigid space-time coordinates. You can visit other planets only in your present . Your present may be the past or the future as far as inhabitants of a given planet are concerned. Your physical senses will only operate in their and your present. “Effective” space travel, creative space travel on your part, will not occur until you learn that your space-time system is one focus. Otherwise you will seem to visit one dead world after another, blind to civilizations that may exist on any of them. Some of these difficulties could be transcended if you learned to understand the miraculous multidimensionality of even your own physical structure, and allowed your consciousness some of its greater freedom.” The Unknown Reality, Volume I, Session 712; October 16, 1974 Conclusions So we have provided some important and relevant quotes from Seth to explain how we perceive a universe that appears to be expanding, yet it is not. Readers are encouraged to research these ideas, read some of the Seth books and form their own opinions. I particularly recommend “Seth Speaks” and “The Nature of Personal Reality,” for anyone that has not read Seth before. This document is a living document.

Please consider printing for distribution. 12 Ebooks Deserving the Nobel Prize Abstract Considering that no scientist has ever been awarded more than two Nobel Prizes, it will seem immodest for this author to make such a claim. However, my intention is to get scientific readers to pay attention. For someone to make such a bold claim, surely there must be some substance behind it. Each of these ebooks represents a large step forward in scientific understanding. Each of them is a significant change from current thinking in the scientific community. Each represents a large pathway forward, for further research. The titles are: (1) The Discovery of Parallel Universes, (2) Time Travel: An Approximate Mathematical Solution, (3) Mathemtical Solution Unifying the Four Fundamental Forces in Nature, (4) 3 New Elementary Particles, (5) Faster Than Light Travel: The Basic Mechanics, (6) New Standard Model for Elementary Particles, (7) City in the Sky: Basic Theory and Design for a Floating City, (8) Synthetic Food Production: Solving Global Hunger, (9) Elementary Particles: Solving the Antimatter Problem, (10) The Single Cure: Human Life Extension to 300+ Years, (11) Anomolous Magnetic Moment: Source and Explanation, (12) Massless Travel In this short document, I compare the text of my 12 ebooks to some of the greatest minds which were awarded the prize. Most of my ebooks can be obtained for free at lulu, smashwords, apple ibooks, amazon, google play, and other websites. For skeptical readers, one can easily provide a list of Nobel prizes that have been awarded for mediocre and even flawed research. A Nobel was awarded for predicting the Higgs Boson. Should this author expect 1007 Nobels for the remaining undiscovered elementary particles which I have identified? That seems a little excessive, but it would follow the current logic of the Nobel Committee. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I would be easily satisfied with 12 Nobels. My work over the last 5 years is possibly among the greatest scientific and mathematical contributions ever recorded in world history. Yes, I am immodest. Yes, I expect readers to notice the internal references and begin reading the Seth (Jane Roberts) books. Until each person has actually read and understood these ebooks, they will have no room for skepticism. And that is my point – to get you to read. If my immodesty gains your attention and initiates your reading, then I have succeeded, even with skeptics. I am also pleased that my ebooks have encouraged the Majority Intelligence Committee (MAJIC) to accelerate their disclosure efforts. As I have notably included in my prior ebooks, I once again gratefully acknowledge Seth, Jane Roberts, and Rob Butts for their significant contributions. For a complete list of my published ebooks, see “Ebooks published on Smashwords and Lulu by Richard Lighthouse;” ISBN 9781370721948."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Introduction In my opinion, these ebook titles are worthy and deserving of a Nobel Prize: 1.

Massless Travel, ISBN 9781310313233 “Characteristics of the Lighthouse Frequency” should probably be on this list, but I didn't want to have 13 total. Perhaps some readers will consider some of my other ebooks to be more important, or even works of other scientists. Let's compare these titles to some of the famous Nobel Laureates, and their rationale:[1] 1921, Albert Einstein - \"for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect \" 1922, Neils Bohr - \"for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them\" 1932, Werner Heisenberg - \"for the creation of quantum mechanics , the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen\" 1949, Hideki Yukawa - \"for his prediction of the existence of mesons on the basis of theoretical work on nuclear forces \" 1969, Murray Gell-Mann - \"for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions\" 1976, Burton Richter - \"for pioneering work in the discovery of a heavy elementary particle of a new kind\" Clearly, the summaries of my 12 ebooks-ideas are equal to or greater than the ideas presented with Nobel Prizes shown here. Note that I did not have to reference the great minds, I could have used the lesser awards,"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"some of which were, and will be proven incorrect... I am reminded of the public ridicule endured by the Wright Brothers after their invention, which most scientists of the day, said was impossible: \"You who make a policy of automatically rejecting 'crazy' ideas without first giving them a fair hearing, you would have joined the experts in 1905 who refused to view the Wright Flyer in action, and whose continuing public ridicule eventually forced the Wrights to abandon the USA and move to France.\" amasci.com/freenrg/arrhenus.html \"Theories have four stages of acceptance: i) this is worthless nonsense; ii) this is an interesting, but perverse, point of view. iii) this is true but quite unimportant. iv) I always said so.\" - J.B.S. Haldane, 1963 \"All great truths began as blasphemies\" - George Bernard Shaw Suggested reading: www.skepticalaboutskeptics.org So claiming the 12 Nobels may seem much, when compared to these great minds. But maybe that's the point - to quantify and qualify the body of work I have presented. Conclusions So I have described 12 ebooks representing significant forward steps in scientific and mathematical knowledge. It is proposed that these ebooks and their ideas, are each deserving of the Nobel Prize. The author deserves these Nobels. Readers are encouraged to research these ideas and form their own opinions.
