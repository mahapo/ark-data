Revision 1D Manipulation of Secondary Personalities TABLE OF CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Abstract This short ebook describes the methods and process used by the CIA on Targeted Individuals and their family members. The theory behind these methods is also presented. The illegal CIA program against Targeted Individuals was developed under the MK-Ultra project, beginning in the 1950's. This ebook describes what many Targeted Individuals have witnessed – family members turn against them, for no apparent reason. The methods of subliminal mind control and secondary personalities are detailed. In the book by Dr Collin Ross, M.D. “The CIA Doctors,” the history of the CIA's horrific experiments on people is documented. The grisly experiments of Dr Ewen Cameron were brought to light when a group of Canadian citizens sued the CIA. The CIA paid millions of dollars to settle the case. Senator Frank Church tried to stop these illegal programs, but the CIA changed the names and the experiments have continued to this day . If you are a Targeted Individu al, this short ebook will answer some of your questions. The information presented has been summarized from a number of sources, including Dr Collin Ross, MD and Psychiatrist, author of \"The CIA Doctors\" Dr Daniel Lebowitz, MD Dr John Hall, MD and author of “Satellite T errorism in America” Dr Terence Robertson, MD Dr Nicholas Begich, scientist Dr Doug Rokke, Government scientist and Army of ficer Dr Paul Batcho, former Los Alamos scientist Dr Katherine Horton, Oxford scientist Dr Barrie T rower, Microwave scientist"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Dr Corkin Cherubini, author William Binney , NSA veteran Karen Stewart, NSA analyst Carl Clark, CIA operative Mark Phillips, CIA veteran John DeCamp, Army intelligence of ficer Seth (Jane Roberts), author Introduction Secondary Personality According to the medical community - Multiple personality disorder (MPD), is a mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personalities. Unfortunately , this definition simply shows the relative ignorance of the medical community . The latest Diagnostic Symptom s Manual, DSM-5, uses the term Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), which is a misnomer , because identity and personality are not the same thing. According to Seth, everyone has multiple personalities. It is normal and natural, however , most of these remain dormant for the entire lifetime of the individual. All personalities are multidimensional. Some never express themselves in physical reality, in our terms. They already exist, but only emerge during periods of strong emotional or psychological events, or during an emergency . The definition of a secondary personality , according to Seth: “Secondary personalities are gestalts of more or less loosely affiliated psychic events . Unable to find value fulfillment in terms of physical growth and construction as the primary personality can, they seek fulfillment along more accessible lines... Secondary personalities cannot be referred to as full selves, yet they can certainly not be set aside as so-called notselves. They come into some prominence and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"fulfillment through dreams, and through enticing the main personality at times into the adoption of conscious or unconscious thoughts which would ordinarily not be chosen by the primary self, and therefore at times altering the course of the primary self.” Some CIA History Under the MK-Ultra program, Dr Ewen Cameron used direct electroshock treatments to wipe the memories of his victims, and then used repetitive messages to \"program\" a new personality into the person. This is the process used for the Manchurian Candidate – a story that is not science fiction and based on real events. Dr Cameron bragged that he could turn almost anyone into a viscious serial killer using his methods. In one case, Dr Cameron's patient was deliberately placed into a diabetic coma for 21 days, where he used grisly, electroshock treatments that completely wiped his mind and memories. When he was awakened, he did not know his own name, he could not recognize family or friends. He knew nothing about his life or how he got there. Dr Cameron then used repetitive messages to \"program\" the personality . Messages such as \"You hate President Kennedy . You hate President Kennedy . You hate President Kennedy .\" These messag es can be done for weeks or months to remotely program a person. This same programming can be done to the individual - to get them to commit suicide. Under the MK-Ultra program, the CIA discovered by using microwaves, they could remotely achieve a similar effect. The brain and the mind respond to the microwaves over a period of time, as though trauma has occurre d - a secondary personality that was dormant comes to the surface. This new personality is relatively free of any belief structures, and in limited terms, can be “programmed” with repeated messages, if the person has not set up subliminal blocks. Subsequent microwave events cause the secondary personality to emerge again. The brain's normal electrical processes are"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"overwhelmed by the large electrical charges that are assaulting the neural pathways. The mind responds as though a traumatic event has occurred. And the process is repeated each night. This is why the self-hypnosis is so important. Repeated at bedtime - \"I will only react to constructive suggestions.\" The use of a grounding wire to an external ground may be helpful in reducing the amount of electrical charge that accumulates each night. Dr Doug Rokke has identified the frequency range around 450 MHz, as being the frequencies that are used to deliver subliminal messages. Psychiatric Fraud Psychiatric diagnosis of mental disorders is a fraud. The medical community has allowed this to continue for too long. There are no defining Lab tests. No chemical tests. No definitive blood, saliva, hair, brain, or genetic tests. It is not objective. It is not science. It is fraud. Instead, what we have are Committees of Psychiatrists that have assembled arbitrary groups of behaviors and labeled them as disorders. Some of the Psychiatrists and scientists that have stated this: Fred Baughman, MD Peter Breggin, MD Dr Margaret Hagen Supriya Sharma, MD www.cchr.org/cchr-reports/massive-fraud/introduction.html "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The President of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons, Dr Mark Schiller , admitted: “I have frequently seen psychiatrists diagnose patients with a range of psychiatric diagnoses that aren’t justified, to obtain [insurance] reimbursements.” Tana Dineen, a Canadian psychologist, has stated, “Unlike medical diagnoses that convey a probable cause, appropriate treatment and likely prognosis, the disorde rs listed in DSM-IV [and ICD-10 ] are terms arrived at through peer consensus”—literally , a vote by APA committee members—and designed largely for billing purposes. Unfortunately , psychiatric and psychologist organizations do not police this criminality . Paul Fink, former president of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), admitted: “It is the task of the APA to protect the earning power of psychiatrists.” From Dr. Supriya Sharma, MD - “For mental/psychiatric disorders in general, including depressio n, anxiety , schizophrenia, and ADHD, there are no confirmato ry gross, microscopic or chemical abnormalities that have been validated for objective physical diagnosis.” Dr. Sharma is readily admitting that the diagnosis of mental disorders has no basis in actual science. The roster of crimes committed by some Psychiatrists and Psychologists ranges from fraud, drug offenses, rape and sexual abuse to child molestation, assault, manslaughter and murder . The Citizens Commission on Human Rights has a database, www.psychcrime.org that lists some of the people in the mental health industry who have been convicted for these crimes. Symptoms of Microwave Targeting For TI's and their family members, some of the symptoms of microwave attacks are: 1) Loss of short-term memory ."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2) Difficulty in concentrating on routine chores during the day . 3) Headaches 4) Secondary personality that will appear when under emotional stress. In general, the secondary personality will be more aggressive and hostile than their primary personality . Short-term memory loss is related to the RNA processes in the brain, which are altered by the electrical charge. It may be helpful to ground your body using the grounding in your outlets. CAUTION: Be certain you are placing the ground wire into the bottom hole, in a 3-prong outlet. Figure 1. Ground a wire to the bottom hole in a 3-prong outlet. Use some tape to hold it in place. One method is to stick the loose end under the elastic in your underwear, or connect the ground to a piece of aluminum foil that is touching your bare skin. How Individuals Are Tracked Although some of the earlier techniques involved microchip tracking devices, similar to RF pet tracking, no chip implants are required to track a person on the ground, using the latest satellite technology . Here is how it works"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" F igure 2. Microwave Targeting. A grid pattern of microwave shots or “bullets” is used and the reflected signal tells them exactly where you are and how you are positione d. Your body is mostly water – and this has a unique reflected signal. Your brain will emit a unique frequency that identifies you among a crowd of people that are being hit with microw aves. This grid scan can be done in a matter of seconds using the satellite, and is particularly easy if the target is still or sleeping. It even works thru many stories in an apartment building – because the reflected signal is very unique when it hits a person. If a mylar sheet is placed above the person, you can actually hear the microwave shots hitting the mylar sheet. (a microphone recording can be made this way with the sound amplified.) The satellite's tracking signal can shoot more than 20 times per second – and the frequency is about 3600 to 3750 MHz. They can track many people at the same time with one satellite. No tracking chip implant is needed. "},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Figure 3. How does it track someone walking around? (This technology is describe d in general terms here, as the specific capabilities and limits of the tracking satellites are not known) Your skull bone makes an excellent reflector of a microwave beam. The reflected signal can be tracked by using a pattern of the top of your head. The tracking signal frequency at 3640 MHz, bounces a signal off the person's head in 4 or more locations – we will use 12, 3, 6, and 9 as an example. This tracking signal is shot many times each second, so when the person moves, the motion is detected by an absent reflection and the aim is adjusted according ly. For example, if the person suddenly moves right, then the 9 o'clock position will suddenly reflect a different signal – and the satellite is programmed to move to the right until it recovers all 4 of the signals. The harm signal is always aimed at the center of the last 4 coordina tes – so it always stays centered. As a harm signal, the voltage on the head varies from about 1 millivolt to 10 millivolts, with 10 being extremely painful. Below 1 millivolt, it may not be perceived by the person, even though the microwaves still affect the brain. About 20% of the population is immune to subliminal messaging attacks. The reasons for this are not well-understood, but such immunity can be acquired using self-hypnosis - “I will only react to constructive suggestions.” I also recommend adding “for all eternity ,” if the individua l feels this may help make the suggestion permanent and universal. Or \"I will ignore all subliminal messages.\" According to the DSM-5, Dissociative Identity Disorder is the label used to claim that someone has a mental health disorder , if they have multiple personalities. Unfortunately , these doctors have no real understanding of personality structure, or identity . First of all, Identity and Personality are not the same thing."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" “Identity is not the same as personality . Personality represents only those aspects of identity that you are able to actualize within three- dimensional existence... Personality may be molded by circumstances, in your terms, but identity uses the experiences and is not swept willy-nilly .” - Seth A secondary personality can be beneficial or harmful to the overall personality , depending on the specific circumstances. The results are strongly tied to the beliefs that the individual holds. How the CIA Process W orks: This document does not attempt to explain, how or why certain individuals are selected and targeted under the CIA's illegal program. There is much evidence to suggest that political activists and whistleblowers are routinely targeted. According to former CIA agent, Carl Clark, some of the targeted individuals are randomly selected. In Dr John Hall's first book, “Satellite Terrorism in America,” it is clear that attractive women are routinely targeted and raped as part of the program. Several surveys have indicated that about 60 – 70% of the targets are women. The CIA leads the global microwave targeting program and the FBI handles the gangstalking program in the United States, including payments to the perps. What the CIA and FBI are doing, is a form of terrorism, and can be considered a war crime under international treaties. Much of the gangstalking program is run by the FBI through the use of private citizens – the Infraguard group and the Citizen Corp. These two groups were set up by the FBI to avoid Freedom of Information (FOIA) reques ts. Payments to the perps are made using bogus receipts - theintercept.com/2017/01/31/how-the-fbi-conceals-its-payments-to- confidential-sources/"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":" “The CIA and FBI are behind most, if not all terrorism.” - Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief 1) Once a Targeted Individual has been selected, the person's routine is studied to determine their emotional support group - usually family members. (See Carl Clark's discussion on BiggerThanSn owden.com and youtube.) This happens months before the TI is even aware they have been targeted. 2) Family members and close friends receive low-dose microwave attacks for months, to bring out their secondary personalities. The family members secondary personalities are “programm ed” a little each night, with statements such as \"Your husband is crazy, ignore him.\" \"You want a divorce.\" One of the goals of the TI program is to create conflict in the family, particularly with the spouse. These messages are repeated until it can be demonstrated that they are \"sticking\". This can be done by simply increasing the microwave intensity and within a short time, the secondary personality will appear . The person remains awake and alert. The secondary personality is generally more aggressive and hostile, and the “programmed” subliminal messages can be noted in the conversations. 3) Once the TI attacks have begun, the family members receive extra doses of microwaves each night with specific messages, i.e., – \"Stay away from her.\" The TI is attacked with intense microwaves for several weeks, to “soften them up.” This generally includes sleep deprivation, gangstalking, harassment, and even death threats. This puts the TI into a difficult state, because the close support group that the individual has known for years, turns against them. This can be devastating for some people, and can sometimes lead to suicide. The CIA considers a suicide to be a “successful outcome.” This attitude is indicative of the sick and disturbing behavior at the CIA. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"4) After several months of attacking the Targeted Individual, the process includes harassment from family members. To bring out the secondary personality of a family member that has already been “programmed” with microwave sessions, they simply turn up the microwave intensity . Some TI's have noted that it is almost like a light switch – a family member's look and behavior can change almost instantly , while talking with them. It may also be caused by “trigger words” that can suddenly release the secondary personal ity. And the secondary personality with the \"programmed\" repeated messages, now becomes active. The secondary personality will retreat after the microwaves are turned down, and the person relaxes mentally . One of the best ways to block subliminal messaging is using self- hypnosis. “I will only react to constructive suggestions.” “In some cases the secondary personality is, again, an emergency measure that will eventually tide the whole personality over, allow for the expression of actions before their explosion completely disrupts the personality system; and then the secondary personality structure may be dispensed with for all practical purposes, to be recalled however upon another emergency . In such a case the secondary personality may represent the best of the available alternatives that can be practically taken by the personality to maintain itself. The impeding action, then, would have a survival value.” -- Seth (Jane Roberts), Early Sessions, Session 165, 1965. [The brain trauma caused by microwave attacks is the emergency that brings out the secondary personality . During it's initial emergence, the secondary personality is highly-susceptible to external suggestion and repeated messages. This is one reason why the statement, “I will only react to constructive suggestions,” is important and valuable. Repeat it at bedtime. – RL] "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"“The intensity of particular charges can completely reorganize the personality structure through changes in the RNA formations.” -- Seth (Jane Roberts), Early Sessions, Session 295, 1966. [This statement by Seth implies that electrical charges, including microwaves, can completely change a personality structure. - RL] “These secondary personal ities, known to psychologists, have a much more important place within reality than is suspected. No psychic action is invalid. Every psychic action exists, has an effect and has durability in terms of value fulfillment. Every psychic action, and a psychic action is any psychic happening such as a dream, or thought, that may have no existence in terms of space and time, every psychic action then contains within it the potentialities of value fulfillment, transference, and even energy transformation. -- Seth (Jane Roberts), Early Sessions , Session 57, 1964 This information agrees with the experience that many Targeted Individuals have had with family members. They seem to take on a different personality and turn against them, leaving the Targeted Individual confused and upset. IMPOR TANT These same subliminal methods are being used by the CIA against Federal Judges, Senators, and Congressmen. And even against the White House and the President. It is TREASON. They are attempting to manipulate and control our entire government. Synthetic Telepathy The subliminal messaging process can be taken a step further, into what is called synthetic telepathy – which is a technology . What we"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"have described previously involves “pre-programming” an individual to alter their attitudes and behavior . By using synthetic telepathy , the CIA can manipulate someone in real time, inserting specific statements and behavior . Dr Doug Rokke is familiar with this technology , which uses frequencies around 450 MHz to train the brain to respond to specific messages in real time. This system requires another person to receive or \"mirror\" the messa ging. The receiver person is paid by the FBI to act as a receiver . The receiver can see, hear, and experience everything that the Targeted Individual is going through. This method cannot be used on everyon e, and only appears to work in limited circumstances. (Synthetic Telepathy will be detailed in a future ebook.) The receivers are paid through an FBI account - theintercept.com/2017/01/31/how-the-fbi-conceals-its-payments-to- confidential-sources/ Conclusions This short ebook presents the method and technology that is being used to manipulate and attack Targeted Individuals and their family members. The CIA developed this technology under the MK-Ultra program. One of the best ways to stop these illegal attacks, is to inform people about them. If we can bring down the Deep State, the attacks will stop. Removing the funds from the Rockefellers and Rothschilds will shut down the Deep State - see my free ebook “Rockefeller & Rothschild Dirty Money on the London Stock Exchange.” In my opinion, this has already begun.

But the main characteristic drives of any given personality shift continually; for all its attempts in the opposite direction, the ego must change just to exist, and its very permanence is depende nt upon its flexibility .
