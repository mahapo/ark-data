The CIA began an illegal program called MK-Ultra (MK stands for Mind Kontrol in German). This grisly electroshock program used innocent civilians as part of the research into mind control. A brief list of 34 government patents are provided on inventions achieving some form of subliminal mind control. This list is just an introduction – there are hundreds more that are referenced from this initial list, and that can be found on google patent search, or on the US Patent Office (USPO) website. What is not included in this list, are thousands of patents that have been issued, but were hidden for “national security” issues. The Federation of Scientists has a recent tally of more than 5,000 patents that are subject to a secrecy order in the United States. https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2010/10/invention_secrecy_2010/ According to the Federation of American Scientists, there were 5,135 inventions that were under secrecy orders at the end of Fiscal Year 2010, per the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 restricts distribution of new patent applications on inventions, subject to secrecy orders, if government agencies believe that disclosure would be “detrimental to the national security.” Some of the patents on this list were issued under the CIA's MK-Ultra project. This was a secret program that performed grisly electroshock and torture methods on hundreds of unsuspecting people from the 1950's to 1970's. Dr Ewen Cameron was one of the recipients of large CIA grants for his research in Canada. Many people became the victims of these disturbing experiments. A lawsuit was filed in Canada representing some of the victims, and the CIA admitted the program's existence. One victim of Dr Ewen Cameron's treatment was deliberately overdosed with insulin and placed into a coma for 21 days, where they severely electroshocked him many times, and then used repetitive messages, over hundreds of hours, to “reprogram” his personality.

Seth has previously stated that one of the best protections against sublimal messages of any kind, is repeatedly stating, “I will only react to constructive suggestions.” Repeated at bedtime is the optimal time to do this."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Specific Examples Using Technology for Subliminal programming: http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/scalar_tech/esp_scalartech08.htm The Brunkan Patent # 4877027 \"Hearing system\" is a device capable of verbal microwave hearing. The invention converts speech for remote introduction into the head by parabolic antenna with indication of direct microwave influence on neural activity. The microwave spectrum granted is broad: 100- 10,000 MHz (0.1-10 GHz.) Pulse characteristics are essential to perception. Bursts of narrowly grouped, evenly spaced pulses determine sound intensity by their amount per unit time. Although a wide spectrum is patented, with ranges of pulse and burst duration, preferred operation has burst duration at 2 microseconds, and pulse duration at 100 nanoseconds. Operation is at 1000 MHz, which is the frequency of optimal tissue penetration. Another patent application based on microwave bursts is \"designed in such a way that the burst frequencies are at least virtually equal to the sound frequencies of the sounds picked up by the microphone,\" though the transducer here is not remote.” Stocklin Patent # 4858612 \"Hearing device\" affirms the microwave hearing effect. Stocklin gives exposition to the concept that a microwave component is part of neurophysiology and electroencephalogram (EEG) potentials. Microwaves are considered both emitted and absorbed by nerve cell membrane proteins. Microwaves generally excite the brain perhaps by influencing calcium, a central ion in nerve firing. Stocklin represents the auditory cortex as normally producing microwave energy, which the device simulates, thus eliciting sound sensation. Each acoustic tone is weighted for several microwave frequencies by a formula called the mode matrix, which is used to calculate best perception requirements. Observation of EEG desynchronization, delta waves, and brain wave amplitudes helps calibrate the device. The lowest frequency for hearing is estimated by the cephalic index. Microwave speech transmission in this patent is unremote with the antenna over and sized for the auditory cortex. Other patents have non-remote transducers of radiowave elicited hearing.” MICROWAVE HEARING Allan Frey was the first American to publish on the microwave hearing effect was in 1962, yet radar technicians had hints of microwave perception in World War II. Deaf subjects, even with earplugs, can hear appropriately pulsed microwaves up to thousands of feet from the transceiver. At power levels above those producing the effect, resulted in a severe buffeting of the head with dizziness and nausea, while power levels below the effect make a pins and needles sensation. An Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Command report affirms microwave"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"speech transmission with applications of \"camouflage, decoy, and deception operations.\" \"One decoy and deception concept presently being considered is to remotely create noise in the heads of personnel by exposing them to low power, pulsed microwaves... By proper choice of pulse characteristics, intelligible speech may be created\" quotes the report. Dr Nick Begich Dr Nick Begich recently demonstrated the simple ability to project sound into a targeted person's head. Former Governor Jesse Ventura was given the demonstration, where music appeared in his head that no one else could hear.

Activities that do not qualify as research or activities that do not involve human subjects as defined in reference (b) and as determined by IRB Chairs, IRB Vice Chairs, designated IRB administrators, or designated officials of the HRPP.

Individuals or organizations that perform commercial services, provide products, or perform other services without professional recognition or publication privileges. Consider how broad and easy it is to get around the protections that this document should provide during testing of any person. “If it does not qualify as research” - means if it can be called “torture” - then it is not research. If the committee Chair or Vice Chair says it does not apply – then it doesn't. Simple. Can you imagine a situation where your Consititutional rights only apply unless some committee person suddenly says – “It doesn't apply anymore.”? Any outside commercial organization means – any company doing work for the government under a security clearance – does not have to follow these rules !! This document is basically a military authorization to promote and allow torture and experimentation, in violation of a person's Constitutional Rights. Think about that – a military document that basically says, we don't have any rules for protecting individuals (and don't intend to), as long as it falls under these categories. From a military magazine: (it is) ... possible to create high fidelity speech in the human body, raising the possibility of covert suggestion and psychological direction... Thus, it may be possible to \"talk\" to selected adversaries in a fashion that would be most disturbing to them. — US Air Force, New World Vistas: Air and Space Power for the 21st Century"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Figure 8. The “incapacitating effect” of microwave hearing. Ted Gunderson - (quoted from the following:) http://thecontrail.com/forum/topics/ted-gunderson-a-man-to-remember “Ted Gunderson conducted seminars with Brice Taylor, a healed survivor of MKULTRA trauma-based mind control, who went public. She wrote the book: Thanks for the Memories: The Memoirs of Bob Hope’s and Henry Kissinger’s Mind-Controlled Slave. In it, Taylor documents the process used to create artificially-induced Multiple Personality Disorder, also called Dissociative Identity Disorder. This trauma-based conditioning technique can produce many discrete “personalities” inside a single person. These personalities can then be programmed, somewhat like a computer, to perform specific tasks, as either sex slave-prostitutes, couriers, or “mind-files,” accessible only to the person who knows the special “codes” that will access the “program.” Gunderson also interviewed MKULTRA victim Paul Bonacci. Former victims Cathy O’Brien and Arizona Wilder have also shared their experiences. In the interview with Brice Taylor, Gunderson also spoke with Gene Tatum, who during his twenty-two years as a deep cover CIA and DIA operative, participated"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"in a remarkable series of covert operations including narcotic smuggling to assassinations. Gunderson worked tirelessly to expose the sexual and satanic ritual abuse of children by the global elite. He was instrumental in exposing the Franklin Cover-Up, involving government drug smuggling, money laundering, child kidnapping and recruiting boys from orphanages in the Midwest for sex with U.S. Congressmen.” Conclusions So we have provided an introduction to research on mind control, because many people are unaware of the level of technology at the CIA and other agencies.

This book describes modern-day sophisticated attacks against individuals which experts say can cause heart failure and other fatal or debilitating results. Lighthouse bases his book on information and testimony from such investigators as Dr. Barrie Trower, retired British military scientist, author Dr. John Hall M.D., and Oxford-educated scientist, Dr. Katherine Horton, among others. NSA whistleblowers William Binney and Kirk Weibe recently announced their support for \"Targeted Individuals.\" In other words, there are more ways to hurt or kill a President or political leader than by a bullet.” − PravdaReport.com, 18 January 2017 Appendix 2 The following is from: Presentation submitted to the Senate Hearing on “The State of Civil and Human Rights in the United States,” Tuesday, December 9, 2014 . Dr Daniel Lebowitz, M.D. “Dr Ross Adey - formerly of the Brain Research Center at the University of Southern California, worked on the CIA’s infamous Pandora project. His research involved inducing of specific behavior modifications by electromagnetic means. In his pioneering work, Dr. Ross Adey determined that emotional states and behavior can be remotely influenced merely by placing a subject in an electromagnetic field. He also demonstrated that EM radiation, properly modulated and pulsed, can induce calcium efflux events to interfere with brain’s function---the so-called “confusion weaponry”. Again, this is by 1970. “ “Jose Delgado —the scientist who stopped the charging bull by remote control. Dr. Jose Delgado’s secret work in Project Pandora was directed towards the creation of a “psycho- civilized” society. In his paper “Intracerebral Radio Stimulation and recording in Completely Free Patients”, using radio waves, Delgado observed that: “Radio Stimulation on different points in the amygdala and hippocampus in the four patients produced a variety of effects, including pleasant sensations, elation, deep thoughtful concentration, odd feelings, super relaxation, colored visions (hallucinations), and other responses. ” Speaking in 1966 , Delgado asserted that his research “supported the distasteful conclusion that motion, emotion and behaviour can be directed by electrical forces and that humans can be controlled like robots by push buttons. Delgado stated that EM weapons were “more dangerous than atomic destruction.” “With knowledge of the brain, we may transform, we may shape, direct, roboticize man. I think the great danger of the future is that we will have roboticized human beings who are not aware that they have been roboticized.” He created a brain transponder that was IN FACT used to roboticize human subjects.” “A 1980 NASA document [ NASA abstract Report Number: AD-A090426 , June 1, 1980]"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" described that one can remotely create the perception of noise in the heads of personnel by exposing them to low power, pulsed microwave.... By proper choice of pulse characteristics, intelligible speech may be created . 1980. Yes, 1980.” “Dr. Emery Horvath - a professor of physics at Harvard University, has stated in connection to these generators,\" These electronic 'skull-zappers' are designed to invade the mind and short circuit its synapses... in the hands of government technicians, it may be used to disorient entire crowds, or to manipulate individuals into self-destructive acts. It's a terrifying weapon .\" “To quote José Delgado in his book Physical Control of the Mind: Toward A Psychocivilized Society, p. 116: Individuals whose brain centers are electrically stimulated believe their evoked actions are their own ideas; their conscious mind rationalizes the evoked actions away. People experiencing this electrical stimulation aren't consciously aware of an external influence. In summary, these weapons have the ability to mentally and physically torture people, and to influence human psychological behavior. With, or even WITHOUT the target’s knowledge or awareness. “ “ If you know someone who this is happening to—don’t count them as crazy. They may be a victim of this program . Recognize that the issues they were speaking about before they got into their current situation are still just as valid now as they were before . In fact, it was probably the very legitimacy of their issues that led powerful forces to want to discredit them so thoroughly. Remember that. Whistleblowers must come forward who are aware of this program. Fearless journalists must pursue the story . It was investigative journalists who brought widespread attention to MK-ULTRA, COINTELPRO, and much of the unethical experimentation that has occurred in the USA. Targets must come together. There is strength in numbers. Targets should never give up the fight. Finally, Congress MUST thoroughly investigate the intelligence agencies, DOD research programs, and black operations. The targeted individual program is happening. It’s not science fiction. It needs to be EXPOSED AND SHUT DOWN FOREVER. Thank you for your attention. “ Again, all of this is part of Dr Daniel Lebowitz's presentation."}]
