Absolutely. There is a mountain of evidence... Today we know there are technologies that can induce sound into the brain at a distance, can monitor and alter brainwaves at a distance, can alter behavior at a distance, can induce images into the brain at a distance, can target individual organs at a distance. Can disrupt the calcium ions binding on individual cell surfaces at a distance, creating pain and other effects anywhere in the body. Mind control technology exists, without a question.” -- Dr Eldon Byrd, Naval Officer, 2001 Houston Gangstalking Boss & the Houston Police TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: Conclusions Chapter 3: References Abstract Opinions of Richard Lighthouse: I have been a Targeted Individual for many years now, and I am proud of the research that has lead to major breakthroughs for the Targeted community. Because I live in Houston, the local gangstalking and its sources were important to me. I have identified the Gangstalking Boss as David Cutler, who works at 5320 N Shepherd. Houston Police Chief, Art Acevedo is also involved. He sits on the Homeland Security Advisory Council for the DHS – basically advising the DHS about Gangstalking. The criminality of these covert operations are beyond belief for most people. Had someone told me 10 years ago, about the magnitude and scale of these illegal operations, I would not have believed it. Yet, the CIA has been funding this for at least 30 years (Akwei vs. NSA). This includes the microwave weapon attacks (Vircator) physical torture, and the gangstalking, which is psychological torture. These are legally defined as Torts, and we hope to take down these criminals in a courtroom, very soon. This short ebook focuses on the Houston area, where my research has uncovered the key participants. Introduction I am proud of the research I did, that led to major breakthroughs for the Targeted community, including, 1. Discovering the base of operations at Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado. 2. Discovery of some of the key patents, including the Vircator, #4345220, and some of the subliminal mind control patents. 3. Identifying the key government agencies involved and their key personnel. 4. Reverse engineering of the Satellite Tracking system and cell tower attacks. 5. Helped to form Targeted Justice. 6. Created the web site and most of its content. 7. Identified the Gangstalking Boss in major cities, how their structure works and is funded. 8. Published more than 30 ebooks, free for Targeted Individuals. 9. Found the Standard Nomination Form, Watchlist fraud, and the FBI Perp Manual (Confidential Human Source Policy Guide) 10. Identified the Rockefeller's and Rothschild's assets hidden on the London and Mexico City Stock Exchanges."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Gangstalking in Houston Figure 1. David F. Cutler is the Gangstalking Boss in Houston, working at the Houston Emergency Center (Fusion Center) at 5320 North Shepherd. CounterTerrorism = Gangstalking In 2018, 3 different police whistleblowers told us, the Gangstalking operations are run from the Fusion Centers. The details can be found in government reference documents in \"The Governors of Gangstalking.\" The Director of the Fusion Center in each state, is the criminal Boss for these operations. You might think of these people as a \"mafia boss.\" It is the opinion of Richard Lighthouse, that David F. Culter runs the Gangstalking program in Houston. He is the Director. David F.

It is the opinion of Richard Lighthouse, that these men have knowledge of the Gangstalking program, and support the activities. The people working at the Fusion Centers assume, that if someone's name appears on the Watchlist, the stalking and harrassment is justified, even if it is illegal. It never occurrs to these idiots to ask - \"Should this person even be on the Watchlist?\" or \"Why is this person on the Watchlist?\" Federal Judge Anthony Trenga, decided that the Watchlist is Unconstitutional, because the FBI failed to provide any shred of evidence, that someone was a \"known or suspected terrorist.\" Targeted Individuals are not terrorists. They are gangstalked because they are whistleblowers and political activists, etc. The CIA wants them silenced, and funds this program through the black budget.

Such an act goes against my fundamental beliefs and against the teachings of Seth. I am not depressed. I am excited at the prospect of shutting down this illegal program that affects more than 1 million people, worldwide. I do not own a gun. I swore an oath of non-violence many years ago, and I intend to keep it. I am mentally competent. I encourage others to read “Psychiatry: The Science of Lies” by Dr Thomas Szasz,M.D. He exposes the mental health industry, for the fraud that most of it is. Harris County Psychiatric Center (HCPC) Even while many respected Doctors have stated, “there is no such thing as a Mental Illness,” because there is no valid scientific test to determine it - Harris County continues to promote this absurd idea. It is not based on science. Their website has pull-down menus for various “Mental Illnesses.” This is bullshit, just as Dr Allen Frances, M.D. has stated, and he was the editor for the Diagnostic Symptoms Manual (DSM).

APPENDIX I am a proud whistleblower – see my ebooks about the criminal acts of the CIA and FBI. Readers are advised that the NSA and/or CIA may be blocking or restricting access to some of my ebooks, especially outside the United States. Readers are further advised that digital tracking tags may have been placed in my ebooks. It may be best to download from Apple Books, if possible. Note how slowly the jpg's load into the ebook when viewing, or there may be transparent objects placed inside the document (This is the government criminal's latest ploy). The content of some ebooks may have been altered – still trying to monitor this. If you have tried to contact me, it is possible that emails and phone calls are being blocked. Readers are advised to review the website drjudywood.com which provides compelling evidence about 9-11. drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam4.html ..... Note Figure 63. Dr Wood spent many years researching this and filed suit against the US Government, along with Dr Morgan Reynolds. Jet fuel does not burn through concrete and steel. The cookie- cutter holes were made by a high-powered laser that rapidly ages material - and turned the concrete and steel into dust in seconds. Note Figure 38(a) here: drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam3.html ...Watch the steel beams turn into dust while standing vertically. This laser operates at a harmonic of the blinking frequency - which causes rapid aging. Readers are also advised to see the movie \"Sirius\" by Dr Steven Greer, M.D. It is available for free on Netflix, where it is the #1 documentary, and to watch the youtube videos by the Honorable Paul Hellyer, former Canadian Minister of Defense. He has a book titled, “The Money Mafia.” Also, find my brief educational videos on youtube (Some have been blocked from the search engines). For more than 7 years, this author has been stalked, harassed, and threatened by US Government agents from the CIA, FBI, and NSA - because of the content of these ebooks. My home has been broken into, repeatedly. In May 2014, my girlfriend was drugged and kidnapped from LaGuardia airport. She was unconscious more than 4 hours. This is not a joke. My computer, phone, and alarm system have been hacked, including those of my friends and family. It is truly sad and pathetic, these agencies have become criminal organizations. If something happens to me (disappearance, false criminal charges, sudden accident, etc. - my readers can be certain that the FBI and CIA were involved. See my related ebooks identifying the murders of Gary Webb, Michael Hastings, Phil Schneider, William Colby, Dr Eugene Mallove, Stan Meyers, and others. In my opinion, the CIA, and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) are behind these criminal acts; David Rockefeller was the CEO and Chairman for many years. “The CIA and FBI are behind most, if not all terrorism.”"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" - Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief For future reference, I would never deliberately do something to harm or hurt myself. This goes against my beliefs and against the teachings of Seth. This needs to be stated because the CIA and FBI have proven many times, they are willing to use “staged suicides” to solve their “problems”. Jeffery Epstein is a recent example. Phil Schneider went public with his information on Secret Military Construction projects, after 8 of his co-workers were murdered during staged suicides. Then he was murdered. His videos are on youtube and other websites. Some helpful quotes “There is no definition of a mental disorder. It’s bullshit. I mean, you just can’t define it.”  - Dr. Allen Frances, M.D Neurologist Dr Fred A. Baughman, M.D., \"There is no such thing whatsoever as a psychiatric or psychological disease.\" Psychiatrist, Dr Joanna Moncrieff, M.D.; \"There is just absolutely no evidence that anyone with any mental disorder has a chemical imbalance of any sort...absolutely none.\" Dr Peter R.

Insel, M.D., Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), “The weakness” [of the DSM-5] “is its lack of validity....Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure.” Dr. Thomas Szasz, M.D., from his book “Psychiatry: The Science of Lies,” \"The assertion rests on an erroneous premise, namely, that the doctors were interested in distinguishing insane inmates properly committed from sane inmates falsely detained.
