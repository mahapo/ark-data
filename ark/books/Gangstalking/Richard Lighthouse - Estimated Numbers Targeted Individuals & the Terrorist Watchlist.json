Original 1A – 4 February 2018 Houston, Texas, U.S.A. Revision 1E – 13 February 2018 Estimated Numbers: Targeted Individuals & the Terrorist Watchlist TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 2: Conclusions Chapter 3: References Abstract According to a civil lawsuit filed in 2014, it appears that the FBI refers to Targeted Individuals as “Non-Investigative Subjects,” and lists them on the Terrorist Watchlist. The U.S. government added more than 1.5 million names to its Terrorist Watchlist in the five year"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"period between 2009 and 2014. They are adding about 300,000 names each year. This concerns many human rights organizations, who say that the government has become too aggressive in its efforts to keep the American public safe. By 2018, we can estimate that about 3.4 million names are on the list, many of them American citizens. One of the issues that came out from the lawsuit was the FBI's nomenclature of “Non-Investigative Subjects.” If someone has not committed a crime, has no known terrorist affiliations, and they are not under investigation – why are they on the list? For Targeted Individuals, this means something. They already know they are not being investigated for a crime, they have been targeted for an illegal, Deep State program that involves stalking, harassment, and microwave satellite attacks. This is the list where the names are held and local police departments have been instructed to refer all such contacts to the FBI and CIA. The police chiefs of most cities in America are trained by the FBI. In the 2014 lawsuit, according to attorney, Gadeir Abbas, the FBI is “literally putting people they decided not to investigate on the federal government watch list.” According to the FBI, about 5% of the terror watchlist is U.S. citizens, and the majority of those are not being investigated for anything. We can deduce by 2018, about 170,000 U.S. citizens are Targeted Individuals. If it continues to grow at this rate, about 15,000 are added each year. The term “Non-Investigative Subject” can be used on a FOIA request. “The CIA and FBI are behind most, if not all terrorism,” - Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief. Introduction A lawsuit filed in 2014, appears to show that the FBI uses the Terrorist Watchlist to hold the names of persons that are being targeted or persecuted. Local police departments and the police chief, who has been trained by the FBI, are instructed to refer all such contacts with listed names – to the FBI or CIA. Targeted Individuals are referred to as “Non-Investigative Subjects”, meaning they are not being investigated for a crime, and they are not suspected of anything, yet their name continues to be on the list. If you are a Targeted Individual – your name appears on the Terrorist Watchlist. This is why the local police department will “lose” any report that you file. According to wikipedia.org “The Terrorist Screening Database or TSDB is the central terrorist watchlist consolidated by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center and used by multiple agencies to compile their specific watchlists and for screening. As of June 2016 the list is estimated to contain over 2,484,442 records, consisting of 1,877,133 individual identities. Approximately 1,600 nominations are suggested daily, 600 names are removed and 4,800 records are modified by the U.S. intelligence community. Approximately one out of twenty of the people on the list are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents.” en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_Screening_Database “During a 12-month period ended in March this year, for example, the U.S. intelligence community suggested on a daily basis that 1,600 people qualified for the list because they"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"presented a \"reasonable suspicion,\" according to data provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee by the FBI in September and made public last week.” www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/31/AR2009103102141.html Part of the problem is the number of errors on the list: “The Justice Department's Office of Inspector General has criticized the list for frequent errors and slow response to complaints. An audit by the Office of Inspector General found that 38% of a 105 record sample contained inaccuracies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said it is redressing errors, and a 2006 review of the No Fly List reduced its size by half, from 71,872 records to 34,230 records.” If names are added to the list, with little fact-checking or corroboration, that would also indicate its purpose is different than what the FBI has stated. “The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) is a division of the National Security Branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It is the duty of the TSC to identify suspected or potential terrorists. Though housed within the FBI, the TSC is a multi-agency organization, including representatives from the United States Department of Justice, the United States Department of State, the United States Department of Homeland Security, the United States Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, and various private contractors. It is located in Vienna, Virginia, near Virginia State Route 123.” - from Wikipedia.org There are about 245 million adults in the United States. At a rate of 170,000 per 245 million, we can estimate the population of Targeted Individuals in major cities. This represents a rate of about .07% Figure 1.

If we include the number of people being tracked as relatives and family members, this gives a global TI count, that is in the millions now. It is clear that the vast majority of U.S. names on the Terrorist Watchlist list, should not be there. And if they were really suspected of criminal intent, the FBI would have already arrested and charged them. Consider the massive effort the FBI has put into investigating Fake Terror Plots. (See my ebook: “FBI – Another Fake Terror Plot”) There is no shortage of FBI agents to fabricate and set up fake terror plots. So clearly, if someone is really involved in a criminal plot, the FBI would have lots of agents to throw at it. Gulet MOHAMED, Plaintiff, v. Eric H. HOLDER, Jr., et al., Defendants. No. 1:11-CV-50 (AJT/TRJ). United States District Court, E.D. Virginia, Alexandria Division. January 22, 2014. The FBI was attempting to force Gulet Mohamed to become an informant and work for the FBI. He refused, and his name appeared on the Terrorist Watchlist and the no-fly list. This is another example of how crooked the FBI has become. “If you cannot charge someone with a crime and are not actively investigating them, they shouldn’t be on a watch list,” Abbas said. “Either investigate and charge people or leave them alone.” www.mintpressnews.com/startling-number-of-americans-are-on-terrorist-watchlist/194356/"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Figure 2. FBI Procedures for Non-Investigative Subjects"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Figure 3. FBI Terrorists Watchlist Nomination Process For such names that have been on the list more than 1 year, it represents an obvious contradiction to the list's stated purpose and the supposed intentions of the FBI. The U.S. Constitution should protect against such government abuses, and this is a perfect example of the FBI's blatant corruption. Is it any wonder that President Trump has stated the FBI's reputation is in tatters? “ After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2017 From another tweet in December 2017:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"“The FBI is broken... We will retask and rename it the Government Electronic Surveillance, Tracking And Profiling Office – or GESTAPO for short.” How are they able to track millions of people at the same time? The technology involves the precise tracking, navigation, and timing from a geosynchronous satellite. The timing systems on the satellite can accurately measure the time it takes to reflect a microwave pulse on the top of your head, so that the precise distance to the top of your head is known within .5 centimeters - that is less than 1/4 of one inch. Dr Bill Deagle has a video on youtube, describing his experience at Schriever Air Force Base. According to Dr Deagle, \"the computing power at Schriever AFB is greater than the entire rest of the world put together, by a very large order of magnitude.\" This is how they are able to track millions of people all over the world, simultaneously. www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzzKACyw7jc Again, there is only one organization in the world that has the technology and the computing power to do this - Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs. Is it possible to bribe a crooked FBI agent and have someone put on the Terrorist Watchlist? Yes. And that may be how some people are put into the Targeted program. Whistleblowers and political activists are common targets for the CIA and FBI, because they cause so much damage to these criminal agencies. Which is precisely why we want to recruit and encourage more whistleblowers. I am a proud whistleblower and I would gladly do it again. If you are a prospective whistleblower, I hope you will consider how much good you can do by exposing the criminal acts of the CIA, Air Force, and FBI. The satellites are only operated by Air Force personnel at Schriever Air Force Base. No one else in the world has access to the satellite control stations. The CIA provides most of the budget and funding for these illegal satellite operations - it is billions of dollars. The satellites alone are worth more than $60 billion dollars – this information comes from the website for the Air Force Space Command. Under the wikileaks releases, a woman by the name of Nicole, has been identified as someone that is working on the illegal and unconstitutional Terrorist Watchlist.

Conclusions The logo for the FBI contains the words: Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity. Is that what you see today in the work of the FBI? Described in this short ebook is an estimate of the numbers of Targeted Individuals in the United States. From this, we can also deduce the large percentage that are silent as critics or have been silenced. Many of these people are financially broke or homeless.

Jet fuel does not burn through concrete and steel. The cookie-cutter holes were made by a high-powered laser that rapidly ages material - and turned the concrete and steel into dust in seconds. Note Figure 38(a) here: http://drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam3.html ...Watch the steel beam turn into dust while standing vertically. This laser operates at a harmonic of the blinking frequency - which causes rapid aging. Readers are also advised to see the book and movie \"Unackowledged\" by Dr Steven Greer, M.D. It is available for on Netflix, where it is the #1 documentary, and to watch the youtube videos by the Honorable Paul Hellyer, former Canadian Minister of Defense. He has a book titled, “The Money Mafia.” For more than 5 years, this author has been stalked, harassed, and threatened by US Government agents from the CIA, FBI, and NSA - because of the content of these ebooks. My home has been broken into, repeatedly. In May 2014, my girlfriend was drugged and kidnapped from LaGuardia airport. This is not a joke. My computer, phone, and alarm system have been hacked, including those of my friends and family. It is truly sad and pathetic, these agencies have become criminal organizations. If something happens to me (disappearance, false criminal charges, sudden accident, etc. - my readers can be certain that the FBI and CIA were involved. See my related ebooks identifying the murders of Gary Webb, Michael Hastings, Phil Schneider, William Colby, Dr Eugene Mallove, Stan Meyers, and others. In my opinion, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is behind these criminal acts; David Rockefeller was the CEO and Chairman for many years. For future reference, I would never deliberately do something that would harm or hurt myself. This goes against my beliefs and against the teachings of Seth. This needs to be stated because the CIA and FBI have proven many times, they are willing to use “staged suicides” to silence whistleblowers. See the recent murder of Mikhail Lesin, founder of Russia Today (RT.com) in Washington DC – clearly a staged suicide. Phil Schneider went public with his information after 8 of his coworkers were murdered using staged suicides. And then he was murdered."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Figure 7.
