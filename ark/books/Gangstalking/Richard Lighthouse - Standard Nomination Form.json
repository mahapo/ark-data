Original 1A – 24 January 2019 Houston, Texas, U.S.A. Revision 2A - 28 January 2019 \"The individual is handicapped by coming face-to-face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists.” − J. Edgar Hoover, former FBI Director “The CIA and FBI are behind most, if not all terrorism.” --- Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief Targeted Individuals: Standard Nomination Form TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: Conclusions Chapter 3: References Abstract Rev 2A - This short ebook describes the method used by government criminals globally, to induct people into the corrupt CIA torture progr am. If you are a Targeted Individual, someone submitted this form with your information on it - to make you a Targeted Individual. More than 90% of the persons listed on the FBI Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) and the National CounterTerrorism Center (NCTC) TIDE Database are not terrorists. The vast majority of these people are unwilling participants in a secret CIA torture program that evolved from MK-Ultra. It is commonly called the Targeted Individual program. The information form used to induct someone into this corrupt program is called the Standard Nomination form or Standard Nomination Tool. By using the same form and techniques, it may be possible to fool these same government criminals into inducting their own people into the abusive torture system. Background information and possible techniques are discussed. It is suggested to submit the form and information through older methods, including fax machines, international cable, or by spoofing email addresses of likely submission sources. These would include foreign offices of likely criminal government sources. New submissions mostly come from 6 sources according to one classified document – the Dept of Defense (DOD), CIA, FBI, DHS, Dept of State, and CBP. All of these government agencies have overseas offices. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a Watchlisting Cell (WLC) in the Intelligence & Analysis Office. Their job is to receive, review and nominate new names for the Terrorist Screening Center. What would happen to this system if thousands of bogus forms with fake names were submitted every day? International sources will often go through U.S. Embassies or international policing sources – any group that deals with so-called “Counter Terrorism.” These are sent to the NCTC or FBI offices in Washington D.C. My personal favorite idea is to use the names of key people in the Central Banking system of foreign governments, and the corrupt Rockefeller and Rothschild banking empires, or senior people at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR.org). If they are involved with the financing of terrorist activities – that would be a valid reason to submit their name. (And it would be the truth.) A list of their names can be found here on; cfr.org/membership"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Try to do a little research and submit something that will be accepted by the government criminals in Washington D.C. If you use a common name, such as John Smith, it will likely create additional problems for the government criminals. It is important to note - the form that is referenced is not a Federal Form. It has no markings that identify it with any government in the world. US Government forms have rules, department seals, procedures, signatures, and approvals. It must be sent FROM someone and TO someone/department. T his form has no legal or official standing with any government, anywhere in the world. You can color this form with crayons. You can nominate Mickey Mouse. And you can send it to anyone. That is a fact. Specifically, this form does not meet the requiremen ts of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. It does not meet the requirements of the DOD Forms Management Program, and it does not meet the requirements of the General Services Administration, Standard and Optional Forms Management Program. It is not a U.S. Government form, and has no legal validity whatsoever. Send it to anyone you want. That is my opinion and suggestion. RLighthouse.com Introduction If you are a Targeted Individual, someone submitted this form with your information on it - to make you a Targeted Individual. Targeted Individuals are well aware how this corrupt system works. It was originally developed by the CIA's domestic offices, which are now located in Denver. This Standard Nomination Tool or form is filled in and submitted through proper channels. If it is done convincingly, it may be possible to trick the government criminals into inducting their own people. I suggest that you be creative with your methods and sources, and it is likely that some of them will be accepted. Based on the latest information we have from Washington D.C., the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center is anxious to accept new entrants because they have “production quotas” they try to meet each month. DHS has a secret group called a “Watchlisting Cell” (WLC) – their full time job is to find people to put on the Watchlist. They are anxious to find new people. The following form data is from May 2018. It may be revised at a later date, so it is advised to check for updated versions.

Pay attention to the spacing and character sizes. (U) means Unclassified. Who to send it to? The information can take many routes to get into the TIDE database. If some listed possible sources were here, that would make it easy to block. Do some research in your country to determine which groups are involved. They are usually involved with so- called “Counter Terrorism” or Fusion Centers. This is how some of the standard email formats look: Charles.Kable @ic.fbi.gov or Charles.H.Kable @ic.fbi.gov If it is an unusual name, then the middle initial is not used, typically.

I recommend that TI’s abuse the current watchlisting system until it is overwhelmed and useless, and becomes a joke. Keep in mind that a real submission is likely to be incomplete or have something missing. Make it look real...

I am a proud government whistleblower – see my ebooks about the criminal acts of the CIA, FBI, and NSA. Readers are advised that the NSA may be blocking or restricting access to some of my ebooks, especially outside the United States. Readers are further advised that digital tracking tags may have been placed in my ebooks. It may be best to download from Apple iBooks, if possible. Note how slowly the jpg's load into the ebook when viewing. The content of some ebooks may have been altered – still trying to monitor this. If you have tried to contact me, it is possible that emails and phone calls are being blocked (RLighthouse – at – protonmail.com) 713.three.zero.six.8287. The government criminals latest hacking efforts include hiding information within the Page Break character. I am unable to delete these new page lines. Other times, tracking tags or codes are hidden within the images. I suggest - print the document out at low resolution, and then share as a paper copy for distribution. Readers are advised to review the website drjudywood.com which provides compelling evidence about 9-11. Dr Judy Wood and Dr Morgan Reynolds, university professors, filed lawsuits against the US Government for fraud and conspiracy about 9-11. Dr Woods scientific presentation is available on youtube and other websites. Readers are also advised to see the movie \"Unacknowledged\" by Dr Steven Greer, M.D. It is available for on Netflix, and to watch the youtube videos by the Honorable Paul Hellyer, former Canadian Minister of Defense. He has a book titled, “The Money Mafia.”"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"For more than 6 years, this author has been stalked, harassed, and threatened by US Government agents from the CIA, FBI, and NSA - because of the content of my writings. My home has been broken into, repeatedly. In May 2014, my girlfriend was drugged and kidnapped from LaGuardia airport. She was unconscious for more than 4 hours. This is not a joke. My computer, phone, and alarm system have been hacked, including those of my friends and family. It is truly sad and pathetic, these agencies have become criminal organizations. If something happens to me (disappearance, false criminal charges, sudden accident, etc) - my readers can be certain that the CIA and FBI were involved. I would never deliberately harm myself, it is against my beliefs. In my opinion, the CIA and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) are directing these criminal acts; David Rockefeller was the CEO and Chairman for many years. “The CIA and FBI are behind most, if not all terrorism.” - Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief Figure 6.
