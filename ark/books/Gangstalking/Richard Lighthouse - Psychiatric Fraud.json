Revision 1A – 26 November 2017 TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 2: Conclusions Chapter 3: References Abstract The United States Government and the Deep State are using the fraudulent Psychiatric system in this country to abuse the rights of citizens. This is being done to silence dissent, critics of government policy, and whistleblowers. There are numerous examples of individuals being forcibly confined to a mental hospital, when their only offense was challenging government corruption. The Diagnostic Symptoms Manual (DSM-5) has been substantially revised to include fake diseases for all kinds bogus symptoms, making it easier to silence"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"critics and whistleblowers. This latest revision to the DSM-5 was a carefully orchestrated government exercise, that was done under secrecy and a lack of transparency, which many doctors have complained about. This fraud is relevant to Targeted Individuals because to maintain the torture program, the CIA must convince the public that TI's are mentally unstable. Psychiatric diagnosis of mental disorders is a fraud. There are no chemical tests, no laboratory tests, no definitive blood, saliva, hair, brain, or genetic tests. No brain scan. No MRI. No CAT scan that can define mental illness. It is not objective. It is not scientific. It is fraud.

He charged felonies had been downgraded, crime reports taken were never filed, and in still other cases, crime victims were discouraged from filing complaints at all. Weeks later, on Halloween night, he was taken from his apartment in handcuffs to the psychiatric ward of Jamaica Hospital, where he claimed he was held against his will for six days. Schoolcraft had left work sick that day, after being harassed by senior officers in his precinct who had learned of his complaints, his attorney said. He filled out a sick form but failed to have it signed by his supervisor. Senior officers arrived at this apartment and encouraged him to return to work, but he refused. \"Act like a man,\" Schoolcraft was warned, according to attorney Jon Norinsberg. When he refused, he was declared an EDP, or emotionally disturbed person, and police transported him to Jamaica Hospital's psychiatric ward.

The report entitled \" Effective Speak Up Arrangements for Whistleblowers\" revealed that organisations demonize whistleblowers and portray them as mentally ill or discredit their claims. The study of 25 workers who revealed wrongdoing in their organizations such as banks and healthcare found that whistleblowers lost their job either by being pressured out of the organization or being dismissed. If they did stay they suffered retaliation through bullying, demotion, isolation or harassment while some were forced by their company to take mental health counselling. Many did crack under pressure, suffering mental illness through depression, panic attacks or developed drinking problems.

In Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 32nd Edition (Elsevier Sanders 2012). Dorland's is the most respected medical dictionary in existence. Dorland's defines \"illness\" with a single word: \"disease\" (p. 914) and defines disease (p. 527): “dis.ease (dĭ-zēz) [Fr. dès from + aise ease] any deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of a part, organ, or system of the body as manifested by characteristic symptoms and signs; the etiology, pathology, and prognosis may be known or unknown. [underline added]” By this definition, if no abnormality of the body can be found, no disease or illness can be known to exist. Unproved theories about etiology, pathology and prognosis are pure speculation. This is why so many doctors are opposed to psychiatry and its labeling of mental diseases, according to the DSM. If the disease cannot be detected using objective, scientific means – then it cannot be proven to exist. This would be a blood test, DNA test, MRI, etc. None of these scientific methods has ever reliably proven a mental disease to exist. Seymour S. Kety, M.D., Professor Emeritus of Neuroscience in Psychiatry, and Steven Matthysse, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Psychobiology, both of Harvard Medical School,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"said \" an impartial reading of the recent literature does not provide the hoped-for clarification of the catecholamine hypotheses, nor does compelling evidence emerge for other biological differences that may characterize the brains of patients with mental disease\" ( The New Harvard Guide to Psychiatry , Harvard University Press, p. 148). 1988. In 1992, a panel of experts from the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment concluded: \"Many questions remain about the biology of mental disorders. In fact, research has yet to identify specific biological causes for any of these disorders ...Mental disorders are classified on the basis of symptoms because there are as yet no biological markers or laboratory tests for them\" ( The Biology of Mental Disorders , U.S. Gov't Printing Office 1992) The Deep State, the CIA, and FBI are abusing the rights of citizens through a broken system of psychiatry and psychology. For those unfamiliar with the Deep State, I recommend the books of Dr Peter Dale Scott, Professor at UC Berkeley (PeterDaleScott.com), and Dr Steven Greer, MD. (Unacknowledged.com) Dr Thomas Szasz, MD, His 1961 book, The Myth of Mental Illness , provided the philosophical basis for the antipsychiatry and patient advocate movements that began in the 1960s. The current official list of mental disorders in DSM-5 is around 300. That’s 300—separately defined, treatable, and covered by insurance plans. Dr. Allen Frances, in a December 2010 Wired interview ( “Inside the Battle to Define Mental Illness” ), stated: “There is no definition of a mental disorder. It’s bullshit. I mean, you just can’t define it.” Dr Frances was the editor for DSM-4. There are no definitive chemical or biological tests for any so-called mental disorder. This fact is stunning to most people. They assume psychiatry is a science. It is not. It never was. Big Pharma sits behind it all, financing the institution of psychiatry and selling the drugs. For many decades, the Rockefeller Foundation has funded much of the activities of the American Medical Association (AMA) and its research activities. The Rockefellers controlled what research was funded and what was rejected. The Rockefeller Foundation has also provided much of the funding for the research activities of the American Psychiatric Association (APA). This is not a coincidence. By controlling the opinions and priorities, and by hand-picking the board members for these two medical authorities - the Rockefellers were able to control medical diagnostics on a global scale. Some doctors have noticed the corruption and have started rejecting the content of the DSM. www.thrivemovement.com/american-medical-association-largely-funded-rockefellers"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Rockefeller Foundation website points to various connections between the American Medical Association and the Foundation. Here are a few examples: • Rockefeller Foundation Annual Report, 1932 • Rockefeller Foundation Annual Report, 1957 • Making the eHealth Connection: Participants • The Long Road to Universal Health Coverage The American Medical Association has been accepting money from the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations from as early as 1910. In The World Without Cancer G. Edward Griffin makes the argument that the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations began to support the AMA in an effort to control the medical schooling establishment and to gain power over this “large and vital sphere of American life.” Diagnostic Symptoms Manual, DSM-5: This version, unlike all previous versions, was conceived in almost total secrecy. There was a public comment period, but all members of the committee had to sign a non-disclosure agreement. As a result, there has been no transparency as was the norm in the past. What we know of this new diagnostic manual is limited to what the American Psychiatric Association has released piecemeal. The new version has 947 p ages and over 300 diagnoses. Dr Thomas R. Insel, M.D., Director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), delivered a sharply worded statement saying the NIMH would no longer fund research based on the DSM-5. His criticism is the same as mine, “The weakness” [of the DSM-5] “is its lack of validity....Unlike our definitions of ischemic heart disease, lymphoma, or AIDS, the DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure.” The following is from attorney, Lawrence Stevens, whose practice has included representing psychiatric \"patients.\": “Among those criticizing the DSM-5 is Dr. Allen Frances, editor of DSM-IV, and Dr. Robert Spitzer, editor of DSM-III. Spitzer wrote an open letter to the DSM-5 committee complaining that forcing task force members to sign a non-disclosure contract, which flies in the face of proper protocols for scientific or medical projects. About 70% of the current task force members have ties or funding from the pharmaceutical industry .” “ECT consists of electricity being passed through the brain with a force of from 70 to 400 volts and an amperage of from 200 milliamperes to 1.6 amperes (1600 milliamperes). The electric shock is administered for as little as a fraction of a second to as long as several seconds. The electrodes are placed on each side of the head at about the temples, or sometimes on the front and back of one side of the head so the electricity will pass through just the left or right side of the brain (which is called \"unilateral\" ECT).”"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"“Some psychiatrists falsely claim ECT consists of a very small amount of electricity being passed through the brain. In fact, the 70 to 400 volts and 200 to 1600 milliamperes used in ECT is quite powerful. The power applied in ECT is typically as great as that found in the wall sockets in your home. It could kill the \"patient\" if the current were not limited to the head. The electricity in ECT is so powerful it can burn the skin on the head where the electrodes are placed. Because of this, psychiatrists use electrode jelly, also called conductive gel, to prevent skin burns from the electricity. The electricity going through the brain causes seizures so powerful the so-called patients receiving this so-called therapy have broken their own bones during the seizures. To prevent this, a muscle paralyzing drug is administered immediately before the so-called treatment. Of course, the worst part of ECT is brain damage, not broken bones.” Emory University Professor, Dr Jonas Robitscher, J.D., M.D., \"Organized psychiatry continues to oppose any restrictions by statute, regulation, or court case on its 'right' to give shock treatments to involuntary and unwilling patients\" “Electricity is only one of several ways psychiatrists have induced seizures in people for supposedly therapeutic purposes. According to psychiatrists, seizures induced by chemicals or gas inhalants are just as effective, psychiatrically speaking, as ECT. In September 1977 in the American Journal of Psychiatry, psychiatry professor Max Fink, M.D., said: \"Seizures may also be induced by an anesthetic inhalant, flurothyl, with no electrical currents, and these treatments are as effective as ECT\" (p. 992). On the same page he said seizures induced by injecting a drug, pentylenetetrazol (Metrazol), into the bloodstream have therapeutic effects equal to seizures induced with ECT.” “It's interesting, to say the least, that any of these three very different seizure producing agents - flurothyl gas inhaled through a gas mask, Metrazol injected with a hypodermic needle, or electricity passed through the head - could be equally psychiatrically \"therapeutic\". Psychiatrists say that it is the seizure that is \"therapeutic\", not the method of inducing the seizure. But why would seizures induced by any of these three very different methods be equally \"therapeutic\"?” “One theory is they are all equally horrifying to the victim (the \"patient\") who receives the \"treatment\". In his book Against Therapy, published in 1988, psychoanalyst Jeffrey Masson, Ph.D., asks: \"Why do psychiatrists torture people and call it electroshock therapy?\" (p. xv). In his book Battle for the Mind: A Physiology of Conversion and Brain-Washing, William Sargant said \"The history of psychiatric treatment shows, indeed, that from time immemorial attempts have been made to cure mental disorders by the use of physiological shocks, frights, and various chemical agents; and such means have always yielded brilliant results in certain types of patient\" (p. 82). In his book Breakdown, psychologist Norman S. Sutherland points out that in his observations ECT \"was widely dreaded\", and he says \"there are many reports from patients likening the atmosphere in hospital on days when ECT was to be administered to that of a prison on the day of an execution\" (p. 196).” “The Food and Drug Administration is in charge of regulating medical devices just as it does drugs, including the machines used to give shock treatment. But it’s not doing its job. It has allowed these machines to be"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"used on millions of patients over the past generation without requiring any evidence whatsoever that shock treatment is safe or effective! This is so even though shock machines are Class III---high risk---devices, which by law are supposed to be investigated by clinical trials as thoroughly as new drugs and devices just coming onto the market. But because of intense lobbying by the American Psychiatric Association---which claims the devices are safe but opposes an investigation---the FDA has disregarded its own law. (For the full story of how shock survivors have fought for a scientific safety investigation of ECT for the past 25 years, see the new book Doctors of Deception: What They Don’t Want You to Know About Shock Treatment by Linda Andre.)” “In April 2009---30 years after it first ruled the devices high-risk and named brain damage and memory loss as risks of the treatment---the FDA belatedly announced it would call on the manufacturers of the devices toprovide evidence of safety and efficacy.” “An article in the March 25, 1993 New England Journal of Medicine says \"ELECTRO- CONVULSIVE therapy is widely used to treat certain psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression\" (p. 839). The March 26, 1990 issue of Newsweek magazine reports that \"electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) . . . is enjoying a resurgence. . . . an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 Americans now receive shock therapy each year\" (p. 44). Other recent estimates go as high as 100,000 per year.” “In his textbook Psychiatry for Medical Students, published in 1984, Robert J. Waldinger, M.D., says \"ECT's mechanism of action is not known... As with the other somatic therapies in psychiatry, we do not know the mechanism by which ECT exerts its therapeutic effects\" (pp. 120 & 389). Psychiatrists claim unhappiness or so-called depression is sometimes caused by unknown biological abnormalities in the brain. They say by some unknown mode of action ECT cures these unknown biological abnormalities. There is no good evidence for these claims.” “As was said by Lothar B. Kalinowsky, M.D., and Paul H. Hoch, M.D., in their book Shock Treatments, Psychosurgery, and Other Somatic Treatments in Psychiatry: \"Fear of ECT, however, is a greater problem than was originally realized. This refers to a fear which develops or increases only after a certain number of treatments. It is different than the fear which the patient, unacquainted with the treatment, has prior to the first application. . . . 'The agonizing experience of the shattered self' is the most convincing explanation for the late fear of the treatment\" (p. 133). One way ECT achieves its effects is the victims of this supposed therapy change their behavior, display of emotion, and expressed ideas for the purpose of avoiding being tortured and destroyed by the \"therapy\". Refusing to take ECT doesn't always work, because ECT is often administered against the \"patient's\" will. In The Powers of Psychiatry, published in 1980, Emory University Professor Jonas Robitscher, J.D., M.D., said \"Organized psychiatry continues to oppose any restrictions by statute, regulation, or court case on its 'right' to give shock to involuntary and unwilling patients\" (p. 279). Even now in the 1990s only one state in the United States - Wisconsin - prohibits all involuntary administration of ECT. “"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"“it didn't take long after ECT was invented in 1938 for autopsy studies revealing ECT-caused brain damage to begin appearing in medical journals. This brain damage includes cerebral hemorrhages (abnormal bleeding), edema (excessive accumulation of fluid), cortical atrophy (shrinkage of the cerebral cortex, or outer layers of the brain), dilated perivascular spaces in the brain, fibrosis (thickening and scarring), gliosis (growth of abnormal tissue), and rarefied and partially destroyed brain tissue. (See Peter R. Breggin, M.D., Electroshock: It's Brain Disabling Effects for references.) Commenting on the extent of physical brain damage caused by electroconvulsive \"therapy\", Karl Pribram, Ph.D., head of Stanford University's Neuropsychology Laboratory, once said: \"I'd rather have a small lobotomy than a series of electroconvulsive shock... I just know what the brain looks like after a series of shocks, and it's not very pleasant to look at\" (APA Monitor, Sept.-Oct. 1974, pp. 9-10). Dr. Sidney Sament, a neurologist, describes ECT this way: \"Electroconvulsive therapy in effect may be defined as a controlled type of brain damage produced by electrical means. No doubt some psychiatric symptoms are eliminated...but this is at the expense of brain damage\" (Clinical Psychiatry News, March 1983, p. 4). Although he is a defender of ECT, Duke University psychiatry professor Richard D. Weiner, M.D., Ph.D., has admitted that \"the data as a whole must be considered consistent with the occurrence of frontal atrophy following ECT\" (Behavioral & Brain Sciences, March 1984, p. 8). By \"frontal atrophy\" he means atrophy (reduced size) of the frontal lobes of the brain, the frontal lobes being the parts believed to be responsible for higher mental functions. The frontal lobes get most of the electricity in ECT. Dr. Weiner also admits \"Breggin's statement that ECT always produces an acute organic brain syndrome is correct\" (ibid., p. 42). Organic brain syndrome is organic brain disease.” “Psychological testing of those who have had ECT also indicates ECT causes permanent brain damage. For example, in an article in the British Journal of Psychiatry, three psychologists said \"The ECT patients' performance was also found to be inferior on the WAIS [Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]\" and \"The ECT patients' inferior Bender-Gestalt performance does suggest that ECT causes permanent brain damage\" (Donald I. Templer, Ph.D., et al., \"Cognitive Functioning and Degree of Psychosis in Schizophrenics given many Electroconvulsive Treatments\" Brit. J. Psychiatry, Vol. 123 (1973), p. 441 at pp. 442, 443).” “In 1989 in his book The Exercise Prescription for Depression and Anxiety, psychology professor Keith W. Hohnsgard, Ph.D., says \"Some who receive ECT appear to suffer both serious and permanent memory loss\" (p. 88, emphasis added). A woman who had ECT described these effects ECT had on her memory: \"I don't remember things I never wanted to forget - important things - like my wedding day and who was there. A friend took me back to the church where I had my wedding, and it had no meaning to me\" (quoted in: Peter R. Breggin, M.D., Electroshock: It's Brain Disabling Effects, p. 36). Professional people who have sought treatment for depression and had ECT have lost a lifetime of professional knowledge and skill to this so-called therapy. (See, for example, Berton Rouch 's article in Suggested Reading, below). In one state, Texas, a state law requires those considering ECT be warned about ECT caused memory loss.” “Psychiatrists who use ECT are violating their Hippocratic oath to not harm patients and are guilty of a form of health care quackery. Unfortunately, most psychiatrists have administered ECT, and government has failed to live up to its responsibility to protect us from this harmful and irrational \"treatment\".

Gøtzsche, a physician specializing in internal medicine, and professor of Clinical Research Design and Analysis at the University of Copenhagen, in his book Deadly Psychiatry and Organized Denial (People's Press 2015), pp. 26 & 145 In his book Saving Normal: An Insider's Revolt Against Out-of-Control Psychiatric Diagnosis, DSM-5, Big Pharma, and the Medicalization of Ordinary Life, published in 2013 (Harper Collins pp. xi, xii, 277), psychiatrist Allen Frances, M.D., says this: “I led the Task Force that developed DSM-IV [American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition] and also chaired the department of psychiatry at Duke [University], treated many patients ... DSM has gained a huge societal significance and determines all sorts of important things that have an enormous impact on people's lives like...who gets to be hired for a job, can adopt a child, or pilot a plane, or qualifies for life insurance ... Done poorly, psychiatric diagnosis can be an unmitigated disaster leading to aggressive treatments with horrible complications and life-shattering impact. ... Psychiatric diagnosis is a serious business with major and often lifelong consequences.”"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"In Chapter 3 of Saving Normal, \"Diagnostic Inflation\", Dr. Frances includes a section quite appropriately titled \"The Power to Label Is the Power to Destroy\" (p. 109). Because of the damaging, even life-ruining power of psychiatric \"diagnosis\" (or of psychiatric \"labels\"), the validity, accuracy, reliability, and predictability of psychiatric \"diagnosis\" is important. Investigations repeatedly reveal psychiatric diagnosis has no reliability or validity. An experiment was done in the 1970s by Stanford University psychology professor David Rosenhan and his colleagues and published in the January 19, 1973 issue of Science magazine (\"On Being Sane in Insane Places\", Vol. 179, pp. 250-258). Dr. Rosenhan and seven of his colleagues who had no history of or evidence of mental illness, called \"pseudopatients\" in the study, went to 12 different psychiatric hospitals on the East and West coasts of the U.S.A. as inpatients where they remained as long as 52 days. They found that no matter how normally they behaved they were not recognized as normal by the psychiatrists and other mental health professionals they came in contact with. Despite being normal, all were prescribed psychiatric drugs: \"All told, the [eight] pseudopatients were administered nearly 2100 pills, including Elavil, Stelazine, Compazine, and Thorazine\", which undermines the commonly held belief psychiatric drugs are given only to people who need them (as if anybody needs psychiatric drugs: See Psychiatric Drugs: Cure or Quackery?) When the results of this experiment were revealed to the psychiatrists and other staff members of another psychiatric hospital, they \"doubted that such an error could occur at their hospital.\" Conclusions This short ebook has presented many quotations from credible doctors, all over the world, regarding the falsehoods of modern psychiatry and pschology. The title of Dr Thomas Szasz book, “Psychiatry: The Science of Lies,” really sums it up. This document is a living document. The author reserves the right to make corrections and changes.

APPENDIX"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Figure 2. ISBN: 9781370766512 This is a global problem: BEIJING: Local officials in Shandong Province have apparently found a cost-effectiveway to deal with gadflies, whistleblowers and all manner of muckraking citizens who dare to challenge the authorities : dispatch them to the local psychiatric hospital. According to an investigative report published Monday by a state-owned newspaper, public security officials in Xintai city have been institutionalizing residents who persist in their personal campaigns to expose corruption or to protest the unfair seizure of their property . Some people said they were committed up to two years, and several of those interviewed said they had been forced to consume psychiatric medication. The article, in The Beijing News, said most inmates had been released after they agreed to give up their causes. Sun Fawu, 57, a farmer seeking compensation for land spoiled by a coal mining operation, said he was seized by the local authorities on his way to petition the central government in Beijing and brought to the Xintai Mental Health Center in October. During a 20-day stay,he said he was tied to a bed, forced to take pills and given injections that made him numb and woozy. When he told the doctor he was a petitioner, not mentally ill, the doctor reportedly said, \"I don't care if you're sick or not. As long as you are sent by the township government, I'll treat you as a mental patient.\" In an interview with the paper, the"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"hospital's director, Wu Yuzhu, acknowledged that some of the 18 patients brought there by the police in recent years were not deranged, but he had no choice but to take them in. www.scribd.com/document/53699745/Fwd-Whistle-Blowers India: daily.bhaskar.com/news/UP-up-protesting-whistleblower-officer-locked-up-in-mental-asylum- 3022333.html In yet another incident that surfaces the sorry state of whistleblowers in their fight against corruption, a PCS officer, who on Monday sat on hunger strike outside State Assembly, was forcibly taken to a psychiatric ward of a medical college in the capital city. According to the reports, Provinical Civil Services officer, Rinku Singh Rahi was staging dharna demanding reply to his RTI application seeking details of money not used by the Social Welfare Department of Muzaffarnagar district in the year 2008-09, was not only whisked away from the protest site by police but also in the midnight drama, the Lucknow police tried admitting Rinkit to a local hospital first and then to the psychiatric ward of a medical college. Appendix 2 Hopping Disease – A comedic example. A group of psychiatrists made a recent discovery. They found that there is a unusual mental disease that may be spreading thru the animal kingdom, and it may be harmful to humans. Psychiatrists are very good at grouping behaviors. They call this \"science\", because it means you are noticing similar behaviors, and only smart people can do this. They noted an unsual mental disorder called \"Hopping Disease\". it is found in frogs, rabbits, kangaroos, and mexican jumping beans. This mental disorder is characterized by a refusal to walk like everyone else. It is \"anti-authoritarian\", and clearly demonstrates a rebellious attitude and a lack of respect for authority figures. Why else would someone exhibit such behavior? This is clearly a global phenomena - Hopping Disease is found in Brazilian frogs, French rabbits, Australian kangaroos, and Mexican jumping beans. In the DSM-5, Hopping Disease is categorized as \"Anti-Authoritarian\" behavior and may be contagious. It is a dangerous disease and can lead to drug abuse and acts of terrorism. These animals should not be allowed to congregate together, as it may spread to other animals or humans. After extensive testing, the psychiatrists found that large doses of morphine will cure these animals of this mental disorder. Unfortunately, they also found a high mortality rate, because"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"when given large doses, they don't seem to exhibit any behavior at all. The psychiatrists were so proud because they found a cure. Nonetheless, we cannot allow this dangerous disease to spread, as it may infect humans. One psychiatrist noted that some children on a playground were found to exhibit early signs of the disease, particularly when jumping rope or skipping. The disease might be spread by close contact at school playgrounds. If anyone is found to have this disease, they should immediately be placed on the Terrorist Watch List, because this is an issue of national insecurity."}]
