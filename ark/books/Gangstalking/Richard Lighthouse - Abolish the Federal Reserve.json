Original 1A – 12 October 2017 Houston, Texas, U.S.A. Revision 1B – 12 October 2017 Abolish the Federal Reserve TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 2: Conclusions Chapter 3: References Abstract “All wars are banker's wars.” - this is an important quote from a banking insider. This short ebook presents evidence that our global system of private banking is seriously flawed,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"primarily due to the greed and fraud conducted by a small group of wealthy families. In the United States, the Federal Reserve system is owned by a group of private corporations, including the Rothschilds. The Federal Reserve is a private corporation. It is not Federal, and there are no reserves. We, the taxpayers of the United States, have been lied to, stolen from, and exploited by these private banking corporations. The owners of these private banks are responsible for many, if not all, of the wars on our planet. This has been happening for more than 200 years, with the Rothschild family. A few quotes from respectable sources: “I sincerely believe that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies, and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.” - Thomas Jefferson It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning. - Henry Ford \"Let me issue and control a nation's money, and I care not who makes the laws\" − Mayer Amschel Rothschild These are the private companies that own the Federal Reserve Banks: Rothschild Bank of London Warburg Bank of Hamburg Rothschild Bank of Berlin Lehman Brothers of New York Lazard Brothers of Paris Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy Goldman, Sachs of New York Warburg Bank of Amsterdam Chase Manhattan Bank of New York More quotes: “Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The Bankers own the Earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create deposits, and with the flick of a pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take it away from them, and all the fortunes like mine will disappear, and they ought to disappear, for this world would be a happier and better world to live in. But if you wish to remain slaves of the Bankers and pay for the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create deposits.” – Josiah Charles Stamp, 1st Baron Stamp (1880 – 1941) was an English industrialist,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"economist, civil servant, statistician, writer, and banker. He was a director of the Bank of England and chairman of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. “The modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing.” - Josiah Stamp, Director of the Bank of England “Most Americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international money lenders. The accounts of the Federal Reserve System have never been audited. It operates outside the control of Congress and manipulates the credit of the United States.” - Sen. Barry Goldwater “The regional Federal Reserve banks are not government agencies. ...but are independent, privately owned and locally controlled corporations.” - Lewis vs. United States, 680 F. 2d 1239 9th Circuit 1982 “The Federal Reserve banks are one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever seen. There is not a man within the sound of my voice who does not know that this nation is run by the International bankers.” - Congressman Louis T. McFadden “The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government of the U.S. since the days of Andrew Jackson.” - Franklin Delano Roosevelt “The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from it’s profits or so dependent on it’s favors, that there will be no opposition from that class.” - Rothschild Brothers of London, 1863 “The Federal Reserve bank buys government bonds without one penny...” - Congressman Wright Patman, Congressional Record, Sept 30, 1941 “Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce.” - James A. Garfield, President of the United States “History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and it’s issuance.” - James Madison “The money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than a monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish than bureaucracy. It denounces as public enemies all who question its methods or throw light upon its crimes. I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me and the bankers in the rear. Of the two, the one at my rear is my greatest foe.” - Abraham Lincoln According to former Congressman, Dr Ron Paul, the Federal Reserve is an illegal banking system, owned by a cartel; and it should be eliminated."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The First Bank of the United States was set up, largely through the efforts of the Rothschild's chief US supporter, Alexander Hamilton. My opinion's are not opposed to capitalism. I am opposed to the Deep State, and the corrupt, wealthy families that control it. Introduction From reference www.apfn.org/apfn/fed_reserve.htm “THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK IS A PRIVATE COMPANY. Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution states that Congress shall have the power to coin (create) money and regulate the value thereof. Today however, the FED, which is a privately owned company, controls and profits by printing money through the Treasury, and regulating its value. The FED began with about 300 people that became owners (stockholders purchasing stock at $100 per share - the stock is not publicly traded) in the Federal Reserve Banking System. They make up an international banking cartel of wealth beyond comparison. The FED banking system collects billions of dollars in interest annually and distributes the profits to its shareholders. The Congress illegally gave the FED the right to print money (through the Treasury) at no interest to the FED. The FED creates money from nothing, and loans it back to us through banks, and charges interest on our currency. The FED also buys Government debt with money printed on a printing press and charges U.S. taxpayers interest. Many Congressmen and Presidents say this is fraud. It is actually a giant ponzi scheme. Consider that about half of the taxes you pay to the IRS – go directly to line the pockets of the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Goldman, Sachs, etc. We, the taxpayers, are being robbed! Who actually owns the Federal Reserve Central Banks? The ownership of the 12 Central banks, a very well kept secret, are: Rothschild Bank of London Warburg Bank of Hamburg Rothschild Bank of Berlin Lehman Brothers of New York Lazard Brothers of Paris Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York Israel Moses Seif Banks of Italy Goldman, Sachs of New York"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Warburg Bank of Amsterdam Chase Manhattan Bank of New York (Reference www.apfn.org/apfn/fed_reserve.htm)” To see where the stolen money is being hidden – read my short ebook, “Rockefeller & Rothschild Dirty Money on the London Stock Exchange” 2016, smashwords.com and RLighthouse.com; ISBN: 9781370630073. It amounts to hundreds of trillions of U.S. Dollars. Compare this to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), which is about $18 Trillion dollars in one year. In 2012, President Obama, head of the Deep State, signed an executive order that most people are not aware of. The Executive Order (EO) signed by President Obama, October 9, 2012, claims the power to freeze all bank accounts and stop any related financial transactions that a “sanctioned person” may own or try to perform — all in the name of “Iran Sanctions.” It is called, an “Executive Order from the President regarding Authorizing the Implementation of Certain Sanctions...” the order says that if an individual is declared by the president, the secretary of state, or the secretary of the treasury to be a “sanctioned person,” he (or she) will be unable to obtain access to his accounts, will be unable to process any loans (or make them), or move them to any other financial institution inside or outside the United States. In other words, his financial resources will have successfully been completely frozen. The EO expands its authority by making him unable to use any third party such as “a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, subgroup or other organization” that might wish to help him or allow him to obtain access to his funds. And if the individual so “sanctioned” decides that the ruling is unfair, he isn't allowed to sue. In two words, the individual has successfully been robbed blind.” There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that allows this (only Congress can make laws), and it was certainly not something desired by the founding fathers. https://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/13196-another-obama-executive- order-allows-seizure-of-americans%E2%80%99-bank-accounts Former Congressman Ron Paul, has called Executive Orders patently unconstitutional. “The Constitution says that only Congress passes laws. The executive branch is not allowed to pass laws, nor should the judicial system pass laws. So it is clearly unconstitutional to issue these executive orders. They’ve been done for a long time, both parties have done it, but the Congress is careless. They allow and encourage and do these deals ... to get the president to circumvent the Congress. If something’s unpopular and he can’t get it passed, well, let’s just sign an executive order. So I think that is blatantly wrong. I think this defies everything the founders intended. I think it’s a shame that Congress does it, and I think it’s a shame that the American people put up with it.”"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"https://www.ronpaul.com/2010-03-25/executive-orders-are-unconstitutional-we-need-a- private-option-in-healthcare/ We, the American people, need to stop the Executive Orders that lead to more war, and stop the private banking cartel, that thrives on war debt, and executive orders. Without the incentive from private banking, wars can be stopped. The United States has been in a perpetual state of war for too long, trying to defeat an undefined enemy, called “terrorism.” We can stop the wars by abolishing the Federal Reserve and private banks. We can stop the illegal Executive Orders by demanding change from our elected representatives. This must be a grass roots effort, because organizations like the American Israel Political Affairs Committee (AIPAC), have nearly unlimited control of Congress and the Senate. Eleven Reasons why the Federal Reserve should be abolished. (From: http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/11-reasons-why-the-federal-reserve-should-be- abolished ) 1. The Federal Reserve is privately owned. 2. The Federal Reserve has an astounding track record of failure. 3. The Federal Reserve is unaccountable to the American people. 4. The Federal Reserve is a centrally-planned financial system that is the antithesis of what a free market system should be. 5. The Federal Reserve is a perpetual debt machine. 6. The Federal Reserve is paying banks not to lend money. 7. The greatest period of economic growth in the history of the United States happened when there was no Central Bank. 8. The Federal Reserve is systematically destroying the value of the U.S. Dollar. 9. The Federal Reserve creates bubbles and busts. 10. The Federal Reserve greatly favors the “Too Big To Fail” banks. 11. The Federal Reserve gives secret bailouts to their big-bank friends."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Figure 1.

It is not. And this is part of the fraud perpetuated by this criminal organization.

Dr Wood spent many years researching this and filed suit against the US Government, along with Dr Morgan Reynolds. Jet fuel does not burn through concrete and steel. The cookie-cutter holes were made by a high-powered laser that rapidly ages material - and turned the concrete and steel into dust in seconds.

This laser operates at a harmonic of the blinking frequency - which causes rapid aging.

For more than 5 years, this author has been stalked, harassed, and threatened by US Government agents from the CIA, FBI, and NSA - because of the content of these ebooks. My home has been broken into, repeatedly. In May 2014, my girlfriend was drugged and kidnapped from LaGuardia airport. This is not a joke. My computer, phone, and alarm system have been hacked, including those of my friends and family. It is truly sad and pathetic, these agencies have become criminal organizations. If something happens to me (disappearance, false criminal charges, sudden accident, etc. - my readers can be certain that the FBI and CIA were involved. See my related ebooks identifying the murders of Gary Webb, Michael Hastings, Phil Schneider, William Colby, Dr Eugene Mallove, Stan Meyers, and others. In my opinion, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) is behind these criminal acts; David Rockefeller was the CEO and Chairman for many years. For future reference, I would never deliberately do something that would harm or hurt myself. This goes against my beliefs and against the teachings of Seth. This needs to be stated because the CIA and FBI have proven many times that they are willing to use “staged suicides” to solve their “problems”. Phil Schneider went public with his information after 8 of his work colleagues were murdered during staged suicides."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Figure 3. ISBN for this ebook."}]
