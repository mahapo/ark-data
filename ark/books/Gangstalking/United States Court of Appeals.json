Never has a Court of Appeals adjudicated the controversies this appeal presents. The lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans, coupled with the safety and protection of the Court’s Honorable Judges called to defend the U.S. Constitution jus tifies an en banc oral argument. Plaintiffs-Appellants posit that the volume of the pleadings, motions and important matters at stake render an oral argument beneficial for the Court’s consideration of the complex factual background and important constitutional issues in this c as e. Plaintiffs-Appellants particularly request oral argument on the following grounds: 1. This appeal presents the novel question of whether the practice of inc lud ing in the T erro ris t S c reening Datab as e (“TSDB”) the names of innocent Americans such as Plaintiffs-Appellants that Defendant- Appellees admit do not constitute a terrorist threat, represents ultra vires, unconstitutional exercise of government power that interferes with Americans ’ basic liberty and property rights. 2. Whether it constitutes a violation of the Constitution of the United States and the Privacy Act, Privacy Act, 5 USC § 552(a)(4)(B), the practice of Case: 23-20342 Document: 16-1 Page: 12 Date Filed: 09/05/2023"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"XIII disseminating to at least 18,000 law-enforcement, 1441 organizations, 533 corporations, and 60 countries, a terrorist database, labeling innocent Americans --including toddlers-- as suspected terrorists, even though Defendants-Appellants acknowledge they do not represent a terrorist threat. 3. Whether the district court erred in refusing to issue a Preliminary and Permanent Injunction despite Plaintiffs- Appellants’ likelines s o f s uc cess on the merits as well as Defendants- Appellees’ failure to set forth any government injury that would result from removing the names of innocent Americ ans imp ro p erly inc lud ed in the T S DB. Given the urgency of the irreparable damages that Plaintiffs-Appellants and TJ Members continue to endure, an en banc o ral argument will allo w the p arties to assist the Court in the statutory and factual analysis required to resolve the appeal in the most thorough and expeditious manner pursuant to Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent.

T his ap p eal is no t ab o ut the plight of individuals that undergo inordinate obstacles and hours of additional screening when traveling because their names appear in a “terrorist watchlist” that contains the names of alleged “known and suspected terrorists” (KST). This case is about the right of Americans to be free from defamatory government labels that infringe upon their most fundamental constitutional, civil and human rights. The names of Plaintiffs along those of hundreds of thousands of individuals, including toddlers and grandmothers, that Defendant FBI admits do not represent a threat to national security, yet they appear on the TSDB under a ‘secret exception’ . ROA.566 [¶¶ 23-24]. Since they do not present a ‘terrorist threat”, t hey are not denied boarding or subjected to additional screening when traveling, precluding them from discovering they are on a terrorist list devoid of grounds or legal authority for it. Unbeknownst to them, when encountering a routine traffic stop, the law enforcement agents treat them as ‘suspected terrorists and are instructed to “conduct an o n s c ene inves tigatio n” witho ut telling the person. ROA.735. The placement of innocent Americans such as Plaintiffs on a terrorist list is an illega l ab us e o f autho rity.

ROA.565 [¶ 19]. HSPD-6 did not provide room for secret exceptions or the inclusion of non- terrorists on the list for any other purposes . ROA.723. Defendants’ ultra vires , permanent placement of unsuspecting Americans on the TSDB include people that do not meet the required criteria of having been arrested, indicted, tried, sentenced, or convicted of any terrorist offense. ROA.593 [¶ 147], ROA.594 [¶ 151]. The ‘secret exception’ to the ‘reasonable suspicion’ standard that Defendants are supposed to observe when placing anyone on the list are not Congressional mandates and are self-imposed processes and procedures within the Executive Branch. Ibrahim v. Department of Homeland Security , 62 F.Supp.3d 909, 928 (N.D.CA 2014). Defendant FBI’s ubiquitous distribution of the TSDB, across the nation, through its National Crime Information Center (NCIC), imposes on Plaintiffs the ‘suspected terrorist’ label anywhere they go. “Once derogatory information is posted to the TSDB, it can propagate extensively thr ough the government’s interlocking c o mp lex o f d atab as es , like a b ad c red it rep o rt that will never go away. ” Ibrahim v.

USDOJ’s sampling revealed that KSTs are listed in handling codes 1 and 2 of the TSDB and comprise less than half percent (.29%) of the entire list. Those that do not meet the terrorist reasonable suspicion standard included in handling codes 3 and 4 comprise 97% of it. ROA.596. The secret, unauthorized exceptions are the rule. ROA.595 [¶ 161]. In June 2016, Ke lli Ann Burries c i, Defend ant Dep artment o f Ho melan d Security’s (DHS) then-Deputy Assistant Secretary, admitted before Congress that “there’s not a process afforded a citizen prio r to getting on the list”. ROA.583. In that exchange, former Senator Trey Gowdy raised questions that Plaintiffs ask the Court to ponder over when evaluating the merits of this appeal: “What process is afforded a US citizen -- not someone who's overstayed a visa, not someone who crossed a border without permission--but in American system, what process is currently afforded an American citizen before they go on that list? ...and when I say process , I’m actually using half of the term ‘ due process ’ which is a phrase we find in the Constitution that you cannot deprive people of certain things w ithout due process... My question is: can you name another constitutional right that we have that is c hilled until yo u find o ut it' s c hilled and then yo u have to p etitio n the government to get it back?

Is there another constitutional right that we treat the same way for American citizens that we do the Second Amendment can you think of one, can you think of one? ” 1 (Emp has is in o riginal d elivery). Ms. Burriesci remained deafeningly silent. Plaintiffs’ unconstitutional inclusion on the TSDB follows them everywhere, p ernic io us ly interfering with all aspects of their lives. The ‘suspected terrorist’ label imposes burdens ranging from distressing inconveniences such as being unable to wire to money to relatives to life-threatening situations such as having emergenc y ambulatory care blocked. The district court deemed the Amended Complaint ‘fantastical’ and ‘bizarre’ , disregarding the germane and uncontroverted facts surrounding Defendants’ ultra vires , indefensible conduct of labeling innocent Americans as ‘ suspected terrorists ’ . As vic tims o f s uc h illega l go vernment o verreac h, P laintiffs c o me b efo re the Court to request it reverse the district court ’s decision that relies on erroneous conclusions of fact, is contrary to law, disregards long-standing Court precedent, fundamental rights and threatens to perpetuate a caste of second-class citizens in the United States for whom the bells of the United States Constitution do not toll.   1 See www.townha ll.co m, “ Brutal: Trey Gowdy Takes DHS Official To The Woodshed Over Due Process , ” December 14, 2015.

The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) is an operation under the purview of Defendant FBI that develops and maintains the Terrorist Screening Data Base (TSDB). ROA.565 [¶ 22]. Handling codes 1 and 2 are the only two legitimate HSPD-6 authorized categories within the TSDB. They include the names of KSTs . These comprise what is commonly referred to as “the watchlist” used to screen passengers at airports. ROA.594. HSPD-6 is clear: it did not give the executive authority to create any other lis t or category within the TSDB including people that do not meet terrorist criteria. ROA.723.

The ever-growing lis t of individuals on the TSDB in NIS categories exceeds the legal authority that the executive order delegated to Defendant FBI by including non-terrorists in a terrorist screening database without Executive o r Congressional approval. ROA.582 [¶ 85]. Despite this, Defendants and their predecessors, acting under color of law, included and/or maintain names within the TSDB that belong to Americans that do not represent a threat to national security and are not screened as such.

ROA.599. Defendants concede that these innocent Americans such as Plaintiffs and TJ Members make it to the TSDB under “watchlisting exceptions” created by executive fiat for “the limited purpose of supporting specific screening functions” such as “determining eligibility for immi gration to the United States”. ROA.1175 [¶ 8]. All but one of the Plaintiffs are American citizens. ROA.572-575. Former TSC Deputy Director Timothy Mr. Groh stated under penalty of perjury that “any US person who is in the TSDB pursuant to an exception to the reasonable suspicion standard would not be required to undergo heightened aviation security screening at airports on that basis .” See footnote 7 at ROA.698. The TSDB is not a classified document. Instead, it is labeled \"For Official Use Only/Law Enforcement Sensitive\". ROA.599. Defendant FBI distributes it by means of the NCIC to over “ 18,000 state, local, county, city, university and college, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies and approximately 533 private entities,” including “the police and security fo rc es o f p rivate railro ad s , c o lleges , univers ities , ho s p itals , and p ris o ns , as well as animal welfare organizations; information technolo gy, fingerprint databases, and forensic analysis providers; and private probation and pretrial services.” Elhady v.

Once included in the list, there is no way out to get out of it. ROA.598 [¶ 178].

The Department of Justice’s Office of The Inspector General’s May 2009 Audit Report 09- 25 “The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Terrorist TSDB Nomination Practices” found that 35% of the nominations to the lists were outdated, many people were not removed in a timely manner, and tens of thousands of names were placed on the list without an adequate factual basis.

Neither Plaintiffs alleged this, nor is any legal authority that supports this conclusion. 6 The district court accepted as true and adopted this incorrect statement of fact whose only legal ‘authority’ is footnote 2 of OCD’s Motion to Dismiss.

Unknown CBP Officers , 2022 WL 16747284, 1, ---F4th--- (2022). The district court reached this erroneous conclusion devoid of legal authority. Instead, it relied on the declaration of Samuel P. Robinson, the same official that submitted in this case a statement under penalty of perjury asserting, inter alia , that the terms “Database” and “Dataset” are interchangeable and that non-terrorists are placed on the TSDB pursuant to a secret exemption. ROA.1173. Mr. Robinson is not Congress not the President and does not have the legal authority to set the law.

Plaintiffs consistently made reference to the correct legal term Terrorist Screening Database in the Amended Complaint and the subsequent motions. Yet the district court’s Memorandum and Order makes reference to “dataset” on nineteen occasions, and only on one occasion does it mention the correct term “database” to incorrectly assert that the terms are interchangeable. ROA.1619. No statutory authority or executive order makes any reference to this change. 7 Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint makes 27 references to the Terrorist Screening Database, and 393 references to “TSDB”, (ROA.559). Nowhere in the original complaint (ROA.1646) nor the first Amended C o mp lain t (ROA.15.) did Plaintiffs ever aver the term “Dataset”. In all of Plaintiffs ’ pleadings and submissions, on only one strange and inexplicable instance did the word “Dataset” strangely appear: in paragraph 25 of the Amended Complaint. ROA.567. 7. MS: W hen referring to the TSDB, the district court asserted that “The Dataset [sic] contains the names of known or suspected terrorists” (ROA.1621), but refrained from mentioning the gist of the controversy: the uncontroverted fact admitted by Defendant FBI that people that do not meet the terrorist criteria and do   7 This is no trivial mistake. The difference between the actual database and a made-to-order dataset extracted from it threatens to curtail Plaintiffs’ right to obtain information on their ille ga l placement on the TSDB. It is Plaintiffs’ contentio n that Defendants introduced the mislead ing term “Dataset” in a like ly attempt at limiting the informa tio n that the latter have a right to discover to prove their claims, such as when were they first placed in the TSDB and under what false premises.

It reaches factual conclusions contrary to the well-pled facts of the Amended Complaint. The district court failed to accept as true all well-pled and uncontroverted facts of the Amended Complaint, reading them in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs -Appellants. The Amended Complaint sufficiently sets forth Plaintiffs’ and TJ Members’ prima facie c laims o f injury-in-fac t s temming fro m the inc lus io n o f their names in the TSDB labeling them as ‘ suspected terrorists ’ and its subsequent extensive distribution to third parties nationwide. Under Supreme Court precedent, a person labeled ‘suspected terrorist’ in front of third parties suffers a concrete harm that produces injury-in-fact required for Article III standing. T he Amend ed C o mp laint’ well -pled facts stand uncontroverted. They not only establish the ultra vires classification of Plaintiffs as suspected terrorists, but also trace it to Defendants’ conduct.

Plaintiff have alleged sufficient personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to warrant [its] invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court’s remedial powers on his behalf. Warth v. Seldin, supra , 422 U.S. at 498 – 99. The district court’s decision warrants reversal because it mischaracterized the pleadings to reach an erroneous outcome. In so doing, it failed to adhere to long- standing court precedent that called for the denial of both motions to dismiss. B. Jurisdictional Discovery The district court abused its discretion when refusing to grant the limited discovery requested regarding Plaintiffs’ TSDB status. ROA.888. On prior cases Case: 23-20342 Document: 16-1 Page: 65 Date Filed: 09/05/2023"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"47 involving actual KSTs, the district courts have either granted counsel access to examine the TSDB or requested to inspect it in camera. For three months, the district court failed to adjudicate the matter, preventing Plaintiffs from seeking revision from this Court prior to the Court’s dismissal. See Elhady v. Kable, supra (Counsel allowed to review TSDB), Kovac v. Wray , --F4th--,2023 WL 2430147 (5th Cir.)(District court held in camera review). As stated above, the district court erroneously concluded that Plaintiffs failed to plausibly plead that they were on the TSDB, “they lack standing to pursue claims of harm based on their alleged inclusion in such a lis t. ” R O A .1628. Plaintiffs posit that the district court refused to order the limited discovery because the information on their TSDB status as NIS in handling codes 3 and 4 would have precluded dismissal. This is likely the reason why the district court incorrectly concluded that Calvert and Stewart had not alleged how they had learned they were on the TSDB. ROA.1630. The district court’s denial of discovery constitutes a clear abuse of discretion as it tends to indicate it had decided to dismiss the Amended Complaint and thus could not allow Plaintiffs to discover evidence that could jeopardize that result. C. Court erred in refusing to take Judicial Notice Upon ruling on a motion to dismiss, Courts “...must consider the complaint in its entirety, as well as other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Case: 23-20342 Document: 16-1 Page: 66 Date Filed: 09/05/2023"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"48 Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss, documents incorporated into the complaint by refere nce, and matters of which a court may take judicial notice.” Tellabs, Inc. v.

The courts may rely upon “documents incorporated into the complaint by reference and matters of which a court may take judicial notice”— inc lud ing p ub lic records. Missouri v. Biden , supra , citing Norris v. Hearst Tr ., 500 F.3d 454, 461 (5th Cir. 2007). It is proper for the court to take judicial notice of matters of public record. Id.; Funk v. Stryker Corp., 631 F.3d 777, 783 (5th Cir. 2011). The district court also erred upon refusing to take judicial notice of uncontroverted, public, official documents that Plaintiffs submitted in support of their pleadings and arguments asserting they constituted ‘hearsay’ . ROA.1627. In so doing, the district court incorrectly averred that “[w]hile the court may take judicial notice of the existence of these records, it cannot take notice of the facts they assert — which is what the plaintiffs desire”. Id . Along the complaint, Plaintiffs submitted as exhibit 2 of the complaint a statement under penalty of perjury of former TSC director Timothy Groh submitted in Elhady v. Kable , 391 F.Supp.3d 562 (E.D.VA 2019), rev’d 993 F.3d 208 (2021), admitting that there are persons on the TSDB that do not meet the terrorist criteria, do not represent a terrorist threat and are not screened as such. See footnote 3 at ROA.694 and footnote 7 at ROA.697.

T he district court made no reference to it, even though it had an obligation to do so. Aside from the exhibits included along the Amended Complaint (ROA.683) and the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (ROA.348), on May 22, Plaintiffs asked the court to take judicial notice of uncontroverted, official such as, inter alia : Defendant FBI whistleblower testimony regarding the improper swelling of the TSDB through the illic it c las s ific atio n o f inno c ent Americ ans as d o mes tic terro ris ts . ROA.1201. Plaintiffs also asked the court to take judicial notice of Defendant Garland ’s memorandum ins truc ting the F BI to infiltrate s c ho o l meetings and Catholic churches in search for domestic terrorists. ROA.1204. The documents Plaintiff sought to have the Court take judicial notice of are relevant, germane, authentic, uncontroverted, official government documents that tend to buttress Plaintiffs’ contention that Defendants engage in ultra vires and illega l c o nd uc t b y p lac ing inno c ent Americ ans o n the T S DB. It constitutes an abuse of discretion that warrants reversal for the district court to have refused to take judicial knowledge of the documents filed with the court. In conclusion, Plaintiffs’ well -pled complaint set forth sufficient elements of injury-in-fact that confers them Article III standing to sue.

Sebelius , 635 F.3d 757, 763 (5th Cir. 2011). In its Memorandum and Order the district court only stated: “The court ac kno wled ges it is req uired to take the well-p lead ed c o mp laint allegatio ns as true and agrees with the defendants that the p laintiffs clearly lack standing, ” leaving out “ in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. ” ROA.1629. Contrary to precedent, what the district court chose to read in the most favorable light were Defendants ’ unsupported and controverted contentions contained in their Motions to Dismiss. A. Plaintiffs’ Plausible Claims The District Court failed to address the merits of Plaintiffs’ Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive claims seeking to enjoin Defendants from violating the Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act and the Privacy Act. Likewise, it did not discuss the Writ of Mandamus. For this reason, the decision warrants reversal and remand for the adjudication of these claims. Declaratory Judgment The district court disregarded Plaintiffs’ requests for Declaratory Judgment and for Permanent Injunction. Plaintiffs specifically asked the Court to d eclare it illega l fo r d efend ants to inc lud e any inno c ent Americ an like them in the T S DB und er Case: 23-20342 Document: 16-1 Page: 70 Date Filed: 09/05/2023"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"52 a secret exception and to o rder also asked for the handling codes 3 and 4 of non- investigative subjects be eliminated as they constitute Defendants’ ultra vires exercise of authority. Plaintiffs also requested the court to declare that under the Privacy Act, Defendants are precluded from disseminating false informatio n labeling Plaintiffs as suspected terrorists. Permanent Injunction Parties are entitled to sue for injunctive relief against federal officials in their official capacity for actions beyond their statutory authority. In Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp. , 337 U.S. 682 (1949), the Supreme Court held that Plaintiffs can sue officials in federal court for an injunction barring them from violating the Constitution. Ex parte Young , 209 U.S. 123, 159 – 60 (1908). Writ of Mandamus Federal courts “may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). In re Paxton , 60 F.4th 252, 255 (5th Cir. 2023). One such writ is mandamus, an ex traordinary remedy used to correct “a judicial usurpation of power” or a “clear abuse of discretion.” In re Paxton , s upra, citing Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for D.C ., 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004). Before the writ can issue, three conditions must be met: (1) the petitioner must show his right to the writ is clear and indisputable; (2) the petitioner must have no Case: 23-20342 Document: 16-1 Page: 71 Date Filed: 09/05/2023"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"53 other adequate means of obtaining relief; and (3) the issuing court must be satisfied in its own discretion that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances. Cheney , supra , 542 U.S. at 380 – 81. Those stringent standards are satisfied here. Paxton Violating a non-discretionary duty necessarily creates a clear right to relief because Defendants lacked authority to deviate from that duty. Id. The district court ’ s dismissal warrants reversal and remand for the appropriate adjudication of all claims. III. Targeted Justice Has Associational Standing If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other form of prospective relief, it can reasonably be supposed that the remedy, if granted , will inure to the b enefit o f tho s e memb ers o f the a s s o c iatio n ac tually injured . Indeed, in all cases in which we have expressly recognized standing in associations to represent their members, the relief sought has been of this kind. Warth v. Seldin, supra , 422 US at 515. “ An association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. ” Association of American Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v Texas Medical Board, 627 F.3d 547 (5th Cir 2010). Case: 23-20342 Document: 16-1 Page: 72 Date Filed: 09/05/2023"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"54 An association can file an equitable action for declaratory and injunctive relief if its memb ers meet the injury-in -fac t c riteria. Throughout the lawsuit, on at least occasion, the pleadings read: “Plaintiffs and TJ Members...” TJ members’ claims were included with, and equated to Plaintiffs’ claims as it pertains to the first five causes of action. There is no room for doubt that the pleadings reflect that Targeted Justice’s membership’s claims are s imilar to tho s e jo intly alleged with P laintiffs , es tab lis hing s tand ing. IV . Individual Capacity Defendants and Bivens Erroneously asserting that “[n]o allegations in the complaint suggest that the individual-capacity defendants reside in Texas or that they directed suit-related c o nd uc t s p ec ific ally to T exas , ” t he district court inappropriately concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction against ICD. P laintiffs get to c ho o s e where to file their laws uits fro m multip le p ermis s ib le forums. In suits against the federal government or officials, Congress authorizes plaintiffs to bring suit in their district of residence. Texas v. Garland , 2023 WL 4851893, 12, ---F4th — , (5th Cir. 2023). Upon concluding that it did not have personal jurisdiction over defendants, the d is tric t c o urt entered into an inap p lic ab le analys is , as if IC D were p rivate p ers o ns . The district court’s analysis is flawed. ICD’s actions in violation of established law imp ac t natio nal p o lic y and vio late the c ivil rights o f inno c ent Americ ans liv in g Case: 23-20342 Document: 16-1 Page: 73 Date Filed: 09/05/2023"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"55 across the nation. As such, federal courts have jurisdiction to adjudicate cases filed in Plaintiffs’ venue such a s this one. V. Plaintiffs Were Denied Basic Fairness The procedural irregularities of this case coupled with the clearly erroneous conclusions of fact and law indicate that Plaintiffs were denied a fair adjudication of their claims. The facts set forth in this brief tend to demonstrate that the district court held an adverse bias against Plaintiffs that resulted in the curtailment of their rights as litigants and culminated in the severely flawed decision warranting reversal. Plainti ffs challenge the District Court’s sua sponte transfer to the Houston Division and request this Court reverse it. The transfer was unjustified, no party asked for it, Plaintiffs opposed it and even Defendants acknowledged that the venue was correct. Unrequested change of venue constituted an abuse of discretion that warrants reversal because there was no articulated reason or good cause for it. Neither the interes ts o f jus tic e no r c o nvenienc e o f the p arties jus tified the trans fer. Once transferred to Houston, the Court did not issue a Rule 16 Order. Motions went unresolved for months, declared “moot” by reason of dismissal. Even when motions went unopposed such as the Motions for Judicial Notice, the district court disregarded them in violation of its own p rocedures or denied them against Court precedent. Case: 23-20342 Document: 16-1 Page: 74 Date Filed: 09/05/2023"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"56 Plaintiffs’ motions went unresolved for months while Defendants’ extensio n of time to reply to the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, curtailing Plaintiffs’ right to duly oppose it, was granted in an expedited two days. ROA. 431. After weeks of unresolved motions, Plaintiffs reminded the court of their pendency, upon opposing yet another extension requested by Defendants. ROA.1550. Other indication of the district court’s bias against Plaintiffs is t hat nowhere in its Memorandum and Order does it make any direct reference to the two Oppositions to Motion to Dismiss, the Surreply to the Opposition to Preliminary Injunction they filed . F o r this reas o n, P laintiffs ind ivid ually lis ted their imp lic it d enials in the No tic e of Appeal. Another instance that demonstrates disparate treatment on the part of the district court towards Plaintiffs is that for three months it refused to adjudicate P laintiffs ’ limited d is c o very req ues ts to c o r roborate their TSDB status. ROA.888. This was an important matter, as the Court ultimately dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds concluding that plaintiffs had not established the injury -in- fact that derives from being publicly labeled a suspected terrorist. The most convincing indication of the district court’s prejudice against Plaintiffs lies in the false statements and misrepresentations it adopted in its opinion to jus tify the Amend ed C o mp laint ’s dismissal. Aside from adopting the Case: 23-20342 Document: 16-1 Page: 75 Date Filed: 09/05/2023"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"57 condescending and pejorative “fantastical” language used by defendants, the district court uncharacteristically took the disrespectful language a step further such as when it expressed that “the complaint is ‘littered with...’. ROA.1628 . This uncharacteristic choice of words from the district court used against Plaintiffs demonstrates a prejudiced animus. After an exhaustive search and review of the district court’s previous decisions, Plaintiffs could not find a single case where the district court treated litigants with such objectionable language. Finally, within one day of Individual Capac ity Defendant’s filing o f their reply to their Motion to Dismiss, the district court issued its judgment. The district court’s deviation from established procedure affected Plaintiffs’ right to petition for redress of grievanc es and equal access to justice. Plaintiffs ask the Court to examine the procedural irregularities set forth above and those that emerge from the record and upon adjudicating this matter, order the case to be assigned to be remanded to the venue where Plaintiffs correctly chose to file it.
