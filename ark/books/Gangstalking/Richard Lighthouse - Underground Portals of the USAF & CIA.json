Original 1A – 28 September 2019 Houston, Texas, U.S.A. Revision 1D – 28 September 2019 \"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\" - Ben Franklin Underground Portals of the USAF & CIA TABLE OF CONTENTS Chapter 1: Introduction"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Chapter 2: Conclusions Chapter 3: References Abstract It has long been suspected that the U.S. Military and the CIA have created an extensive network of underground tunnels. Whistleblowers have spoken about these tunnels and a Bechtel whistleblower of the 1990's stated that the CIA was building an large office building, deep beneath the Denver airport. Now we have more evidence. The short ebook provides pictures showing where Google Maps identifies “portals” at the Denver airport. Also provided are mapping diagrams showing the portals at Schriever Air Force Base. The term “portal” is a unique word and would never be used to describe a security badging center at Denver airport. Nor would it be used to describe a passenger train, such as the A-Line at Denver airport. But in fact, Google maps refers to both of these locations as “portals”. Very odd. Note that within 24 hours of making the screen captures, the Google maps were altered. That certainly indicates the government is hiding something, or trying to cover it up – and doing a shoddy job of it. Introduction There is a credible evidence that our government has been building a massive underground network of tunnels and facilities for decades. Evidence of access portals and the use of this term on maps is apparent. However, this does not mean that every use of the word, “portal”, implies an underground base."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Figure 1. U.S. Air Force tunneling machine, 1982, Nevada. The Air Force has been digging these tunnels for more than 40 years. According to some sources, the newer tunneling machines can dig underground, through 7 miles in one day. Dr Bill Deagle, MD has been quoted as stating that the underground bases are, at least, ¼ of a mile underground. The author's personal experience concludes that the tunneling program has been extended to other cities in the United States.

The original screen capture using the search term, “portal.” Note: Within 24 hours, the Google maps were altered.

Whatever it is, they will F*** it up... Conclusions This short ebook provides the possible locations for underground access portals for the USAF and CIA. The key word, “portals” seems to be able to identify specific locations. This ebook was produced for the benefit of the public, to inform and educate. The information seems to indicate military corruption and waste of public funds are ocurring. Every instance of the word, “portal” is not an underground elevator. However, it is a start to look for the massive underground network of tunnels that the government has been secretly building for decades. This document is a living document.

APPENDIX I am a proud whistleblower – see my ebooks about the criminal acts of the CIA and FBI. Readers are advised that the NSA and/or CIA may be blocking or restricting access to some of my ebooks, especially outside the United States. Readers are further advised that digital tracking tags may have been placed in my ebooks. It may be best to download from Apple Books, if possible. Note how slowly the jpg's load into the ebook when viewing, or there may be transparent objects placed inside the document (This is the government criminal's latest ploy). The content of some ebooks may have been altered – still trying to monitor this. If you have tried to contact me, it is possible that emails and phone calls are being blocked. Readers are advised to review the website drjudywood.com which provides compelling evidence about 9-11. drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam4.html ..... Note Figure 63. Dr Wood spent many years researching this and filed suit against the US Government, along with Dr Morgan Reynolds. Jet fuel does not burn through concrete and steel. The cookie- cutter holes were made by a high-powered laser that rapidly ages material - and turned the concrete and steel into dust in seconds. Note Figure 38(a) here: drjudywood.com/articles/DEW/StarWarsBeam3.html ...Watch the steel beams turn into dust while standing vertically. This laser operates at a harmonic of the blinking frequency - which causes rapid aging. Readers are also advised to see the movie \"Sirius\" by Dr Steven Greer, M.D. It is available for free on Netflix, where it is the #1 documentary, and to watch the youtube videos by the Honorable Paul Hellyer, former Canadian Minister of Defense. He has a book titled, “The Money Mafia.” Also, find my brief educational videos on youtube (Some have been blocked from the search"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"engines). For more than 7 years, this author has been stalked, harassed, and threatened by US Government agents from the CIA, FBI, and NSA - because of the content of these ebooks. My home has been broken into, repeatedly. In May 2014, my girlfriend was drugged and kidnapped from LaGuardia airport. She was unconscious more than 4 hours. This is not a joke. My computer, phone, and alarm system have been hacked, including those of my friends and family. It is truly sad and pathetic, these agencies have become criminal organizations. If something happens to me (disappearance, false criminal charges, sudden accident, etc. - my readers can be certain that the FBI and CIA were involved. See my related ebooks identifying the murders of Gary Webb, Michael Hastings, Phil Schneider, William Colby, Dr Eugene Mallove, Stan Meyers, and others. In my opinion, the CIA, and the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) are behind these criminal acts; David Rockefeller was the CEO and Chairman for many years. “The CIA and FBI are behind most, if not all terrorism.” - Ted Gunderson, former FBI Chief For future reference, I would never deliberately do something to harm or hurt myself. This goes against my beliefs and against the teachings of Seth. This needs to be stated because the CIA and FBI have proven many times, they are willing to use “staged suicides” to solve their “problems”. Phil Schneider went public with his information on Secret Military Construction projects, after 8 of his co-workers were murdered during staged suicides. Then he was murdered. His videos are on youtube and other websites. Figure 15. ISBN for this ebook."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The government criminals appear to be blocking my publishing of this ebook on smashwords. Epub check claims that I have an image in the ebook named, 'tmp_58bb8fd5cb76c0db1254350db1e68c7a_6QCTds_html_m1aeacc6f.png' and this is causing it to fail the Epub check. Figure 16. There are 18 images in this ebook, and none of them have this file name. The fact that the govt criminals are attempting to block the publishing of this ebook, is additional evidence that its information is correct. Also odd, I went to Epub check online at validator.idpf.org The web site is unavailable. Very strange."}]
