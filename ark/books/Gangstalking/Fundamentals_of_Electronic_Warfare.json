In antiaircraft defense (AAD) forces, radar permits the gathering of informa- tion about the situation in the air. Radar also ensures the guidance of weapons to airborne targets. Airforce high-precision weapon (HPW) installations, including syn- thetic antenna radar (SAR) and high-precision satellite radio navigation . systems, detect land-based targets of small external dimensions at a distance of several hundred kilometers and determine their coordinates with a mean square error (MSE) of the order of ones of meters, permitting the delivery of m~ssive strikes on the enemy in the very depths of its forces' operational formations [1]. Analogous examples of the high effectiveness of weapons attained as a result of using appropriate electronic systems can be offered for other branches of the armed forces as well. Ensuring high operational and tactical indicators for weapons, electro- nic systems are at the same time one of the most vulnerable elements in control systems, since they can be detected based on their radiation and they are subject to countermeasures using technical methods (electronic warfare systems). The dialectics of combat, measures, and countermeasures in this area of military engineering have given rise to electronic warfare (EW). Although EW was considered initially to be a type of operations and xiii"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare combat support, subsequently it has grown into an element for sustaining operations and combat. At the present time, EW is defined as a set of measures and actions performed by the conflicting sides to detect and electronically attack enemy electronic systems for the control of forces .and weapons, including high- precision weapons, as well as to electronically defend one's own electronic systems and other targets from technical intelligence (electronic intelligence, ELINT), jamming and non deliberate interference. The latter presupposes ensuring electromagnetic compatibility (EM C). Electronic attack can be achieved by • Jamming (active, passive, false targets); • Reduction of radar and thermal detectability; • Changing the electrical properties of the environment (conditions for the propagation of electromagnetic waves). ELINT, interacting with other types of technical intelligence [2], must solve a two-fold problem: the detection and analysis of radiation from electronic systems in the interests of jamming them; and the detection and analysis of jamming radiation in the interests of improving the electronic defense of one's own electronic systems in the dynamics of EW. ELINT is also performed with the goal of gathering source informa:- tion for the subsequent development and synthesis of optimum structures and algorithms for electronic systems intended to operate in a given jamming environment. Information arriving from ELINT and other technical intelligence systems in many wa ys provides the basis for the computer data and knowledge bases that form a part of the control systems for both EW and the electronic defense from jamming and ELINT systems. The appearance of EW was motivated dialectically by the dynamics of combat between offensive and defensive systems. In the given case, we mean the battle between English bombers and Nazi German AAD in World War II (WWII). Before that time, there were individual cases of jamming using available devices, but they were neither massive nor organized in nature, and they did not lead to qualitative changes in the tactics of combat operations. Massive use of passive jammers by English bombers started on June 24, 1943 during the nighttime bombing raid on Hamburg and continued sys- tematically in subsequent raids. The jamming targets were Wiirzburg gun- laying radar stations, which had an emitted signal wavelength of about 50 cm. In this case, the passive jamming consisted of manually launched tinfoil strips (dipoles) of the order of 25 cm in length (i.e., equal to"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introduction xv approximately half the radar wavelength). As a result of this jamming, bomber losses decreased by about half for several months. This first use of jamming was preceded by lengthy reconnaissance of the jamming targets. The decision to employ jamming was made after losses reached the maximum permissible level. To a large extent, this jamming was so highly effective due to the wavelength selected for the Wiirzburg radar; the absence in it of circuits to protect against passive jamming, which appeared only at the end of the war; and th~. absence of the possibility to change wavelength. In October 1943, U.S. bombers began employing active jamming against Wiirzburg radar using carpet-type jammers, which turned out to be highly effective because it was not possible to alter the carrier frequency. The period corresponding to WWII and the first postwar years can be considered the initial phase in the development of systems and techniques for electronic warfare. Their subsequent development also took place according to the laws of dialectics. Moreover, the combat target on one hand was radar, and on the other, EW systems. It is possible to distinguish approximately four basic phases of significant change in the structure and algorithms of both radar and EW systems. The period of the 1950s corresponds to the development of noncoherent radar with rapid alteration of the carrier frequency and antijamming devices built using pulse-to-pulse cancellation. In jammers, electronic frequency alteration was introduced. Special devices for the launching of chaff were developed. In the 1960s and in the first half of the 1970s, pulse-coherent radar appeared, capable of filtering out passive jamming and permitting the detection of low-flying aircraft against the background of reflections from the surface of the Earth. Defense from active jamming was ensured in them by increasing the specific energy potential by approximately an order of magnitude and rapidly altering the carrier frequency. EW systems changed accordingly. During the second half of the 1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s, there appeared radar that worked in two modes: pulse-coherent with narrowband signals, and with broadband signals having a big base. Increasing the base enabled a corresponding increase in the radar energy potential. The use of two modes made it difficult to effectively organize both active and passive jamming. In narrowband mode, the effect of broadband jamming is attenuated, whereas broadband mode enables a reduction in the effectiveness of narrowband jamming. EW systems and techniques were modified accordingly. Besides the appearance of high-precision weapons systems, the fourth"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"xvi Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare phase of EW is characterized by the use of radar with phased antenna arrays that can adjust to the jamming environment; a transition to multiposition circuits for signal processing; and the decrease in radar radiation detectability by making the transition to noise-like signals (NLS). The capabilities of EW systems and techniques are increasing. Massive use of these systems has become widespread. After the Gulf War, EW became considered not only a type of operations and combat support, but a means of sustaining operations and combat. In the first part of this monograph, we present the fundamentals of electronic warfare based on systems methodology. The various targets of EW operations are considered in sequence. Mathematical models of electronic systems viewed as EW targets are presented. This includes mathematical models of an optimum detector and radar tracker; models for optimum reception in radio communications systems and radio naviga- tion; and models of recognition schemes. Using the methods of the mass service theory and the theory of automated control systems, we present mathematical models of automated systems for the control of AAD forces and weapons as EW targets. U sing the methods of information theory and statistical radio technol- ogy, models of jamming signals have been developed. Elements of the theory of jamming and jamming systems and techniques are explained using games theory and the dynamics of averages. Effectiveness indicators for jamming signals and EW systems and techniques are defined with reference to information, energy, operations and tactics, and military and economic parameters. Methods of calculating jamming corridors for active radar jamming with various antijamming levels (the level of information stability) are developed and presented, based on the energy criterion. Using this same energy criterion, methods of calculating radar jamming corridors for passive and active-passive jamming are developed and presented, and jamming methods based on the use of false targets, radar decoys, and thermal traps are analyzed. Jamming possibilities based on reducing the radar detectability of aircraft and changing the electrical properties of the environment are evaluated. .

Let us examine the basic targets of EW operations in more detail, based on an initial definition. As was mentioned earlier, EW represents a set of measures and actions for the detection and jamming of electronic systems for the control of forces and weapons (including high-precision weapons), as well as for the electronic protection of one's own electronic systems against technical reconnaIssance (electronic intelligence, or ELINT), jamming, and in terference. Typically, EW methods of operation can be either offensive or defensive in nature. When we speak of offensive operations, first and foremost we have in mind operations conducted using jamming or employ- ing weapon systems that automatically home in on radiation sources. Both of these offensive operation methods are used not only to attack (or destroy) electronic systems for the control of forces and weapons, but also to defend one's own electronic systems against ELINT and jamming. In the first instance, the jamming targets are the receivers of radar, communications, and radio navigation systems. In the second case, the jamming targets are ELINT receivers that form a part of active jamming 1"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"2 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare and ELINT stations, as well as of reconnaissance and strike systems. Typical defensive EW operations involve protecting the respective systems from jamming and ELINT by increasing their equivalent specific energy potential, modifying their time, frequency, space and other charac- teristics, or by making them more secure (masking, deception). As a rule, the most effective solution to the problem of protecting against jamming is achieved by combining both purely defensive and offensive operations. More precisely, this is achieved by destroying the jammer or by electronically jamming ELINT systems and active jammers. Thus, it may be said that jamming and ELINT, taken together, by and large comprise the basis of EW. Other considerations also serve to corroborate this statement. In the operational and tactical plane, according to contem- porary views, jamming is considered to be an element for sustaining operations and combat activities ., while EW defensive measures (anti- jamming and ELINT) represent a form of operations (combat) support. On a tactical level, the definition of jamming as a battle element can be substantiated using the example of airforce subdivisions conducting military operations against antiaircraft defense (AAD) missile systems on the front line. When aircraft battle formations are screened using jamming, they can strike antiaircraft positions without suffering significant losses. In this case, airborne jamming systems represent an essential battle element. They directly participate in the delivery of material damage, having beforehand caused information damage to the electronic antiaircraft control systems. By information damage, we mean the size of the coverage area eliminated from the region where the attacked electronic system was acquiring information while working in normal operating mode during the dynamics of EW. Therefore, jamming is a weapon and not merely a means of support. On the operations level, the thesis we have mentioned about jamming is borne out by the example of military actions taken during a defensive operation to fend off strikes by an enemy who is conducting offensive air and ground operations. In this case, jamming systems may be given the task of thwarting a massive strike using high-precision weapons [1, 2]. By deliver- ing information damage to synthetic aperture radar, ELINT stations within intelligence and strike systems, and high-precision radio navigation systems, jamming significantly decreases the probability that groups of aircraft and missiles, AAD systems, and other targets belonging to the defending side will be hit. Thus, their average combat life becomes significantly longer. In this instance, jamming prevents potential material damage by delivering information damage to the enemy's electronic systems for control of forces and .weapons, thereby creating conditions for a counterstrike."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Targets of Electr01lic Warfare Operatio11s 3 As in any other type of armed conflict, the counteraction bet\\veen offense and defense serves as the motivating force for the development of EW systems and methods. In the case at hand, \\ve are dealing \\vith the action-counteraction of systems and methods for jamming and methods for electronic defense. Everything mentioned above confirms and extends the thesis that systems and methods for jamming and ELINT comprise the basis of E\\x'. An examination of systems and methods for jamming electronic targets of various kinds, together with the specific methods and devices for their electronic protection, make the stages and essence of the content of E\\x! dynamics quite clear. This allows us to accept the targets of EW operations as being the targets of jamming actions and to set forth the fundamentals of EW based on, in the main, a study of the jamming dynamics for various conditions of the electronic environment. Of course, an examination that is limited to the dynamics of jamming and reconnaissance can by no means exhaust the vast range of specific techniques and tactical methods for electronic protection and technical counterintelligence. They should be analyzed by suitable specialists in each specific subject area. In the material that follows, we consider as the basic targets of jamming and ELINT: various kinds of radar; radio communications and data exchange systems as used in control systems for AAD fighter planes and tactical aircraft; command radio lines for the control of AAD missiles; high- precision radio navigation systems; and ELINT systems. We also analyze automated systems for the control of AAD forces and weapons as jamming targets. Radar serves as the basis for modern all-weather AAD information support systems. At the same time, as a target of electronic warfare, it is one of the most vulnerable elements. This is due to the following circumstances. Radar processes signals reflected from airplanes and other targets. To detect the latter against its own noise background, the energy of the signal emitted must be quite large. In principle, this permits us to detect radar radiation at distances far exceeding its effective range of operation, especially in those cases where we are dealing with radar for locating airplanes (targets) with low radar cross-sections (LO vehicles). Radar can be detected not only based on radiation from the recon- naissance sensor. It is also possible to determine its coordinates, carrier frequency, spectral and other characteristics using appropriate receivers and range finders. This permits the subsequent determination of the type of radar and the deployment of appropriate firepower or jammers against it. The energy of the reflected signal at the output to the radar receiver is inversely proportional to the fourth pO'U 7 er of the distance to the object being"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"4 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare detected. At the same time, for example, the spectral density of the masking jamming signal at the input to the same receiver is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the radar to the jammer. Compared to other systems (radio communications, radio navigation, etc.), this situation presents great potential opportunities to electronically attack radars using active jamming. Since the resolution of radar and its abilities to recognize the targets being detected are limited, in a significant number of cases there are also possibilities of jamming using passive jamming, false targets, and radar decoys. Measures are being taken in modern and, to an even greater extent, future radar systems to increase their level of electronic protection and, correspondingly, to decrease the possibility of their radiation being detected and, as a result, of them being electronically attacked. Regardless, in view of their important role, they continue to remain the basic targets of jamming in the AAD system. In a number of cases, despite definite difficulties with jamming, radio communications systems are the only channel in the battle control system for AAD fighters and tactical aircraft. Therefore, by attacking it, it is possible to significantly reduce the possibilities of centralized control, or to disrupt it totally. An analogous situation also occurs in command radio lines for the control of antiaircraft missiles, high-precision radio navigation systems, and electronic reconnaissance systems within intelligence and firepower installations. Therefore, these systems must also be included as targets of EW. The examination, as targets of EW, of automated systems for the control of forces and weapons is required to determine the minimum degree of jamming necessary for the electronic systems that comprise them. 1.2 Mathematical Models of Electronic Systems as Targets of Electronic Warfare 1.2.1 Fundamental Principles The detailed development of mathematical models of electronic systems, viewed as targets of EW, is a result of the requirement, in the material that follows, to determine threshold values for the effects of jamming, which are directly connected with the minimum required degree of jamming. In other wor~s, these models permit us to determine, with a sufficient level of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operatiol1S 5 substantiation, criteria for jamming. These same circumstances permit us, in the materials below, to limit ourselves basically to additive jamming signals. When viewing radar and other electronic devices as targets of E\\x! (jamming), we should keep in mind that jamming signals directly affect radio receivers. A priori, as a rule, the jammer or other electronic attack system does not have full information about the target of the attack. In order to eliminate the element of chance for the victim receiver, it should be attempted to orient oneself by assuming that the victim system uses optimum or quasi-optimum processing methods for the signals received and within a certain standard (conditional) electronic environment. Depend- ing on how the radar or other electronic device operates, differing variants of processing optimization may occur, thus resulting in various mathematical models. Let us look at the most typical ones. 1.2.2 Mathematical Models of an Optimum Radar Receiver Working in Search Mode The basic purpose of a radar operating in volume-scan (search) mode is the detection and recognition of targets and their subsequent acquisition for tracking. Mathematical models for a radar receiver operating in the search mode may be viewed as a diagram that consists of an optimum detector and an optimum system for making decisions in conditions of uncertainty [3, 4]. In essence, receivers must, in the conditions being analyzed, permit us to make a decision about the validity or invalidity of one of two statistical hypotheses about the value of a certain parameter A. In other words, it is necessary to solve a problem involving the statistical theory of detection and discrimination of signals, which is a part of the theory of parametric hypotheses in mathematical statistics [5]. According to methods for verification of parametric hypotheses developed to the present point in time, an optimum decision is made based on the examination of a likelihood ratio, which, in many cases, comprises sufficient statistics to make a decision about the parameter A for the given sample function. In other words, the likelihood ratio contains all information about the parameter A available in the sample function. Let us clarify what has been mentioned above using the specific example of reaching a decision about the parameter A based on the results of observing the voltage (current) y(t) at the output to a radar receiving antenna over a finite time interval (0, T), which may be written in the following way:"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"6 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare y(t) = A.s(t) + n(t) o ~t~ T (1.1) where A. is the parameter we are interested in, s(t) is the anticipated signal, and n(t) is the noise, which is the sample function of a random process. Let us assume that, with relationship to parameter A., only two alternative hypotheses can occur; more precisely, A. = 0 when the sample function y(t) represents only noise (hypothesis Ho), and A. = 1 if the sample function contains the sum of signal and noise (H t ). Let us further assume that hypotheses Ho and H t have corresponding multidimensional prob- ability densities PoCY) and Pt CY). In the given case, the statistical problem of making a decision consists of determining which of the hypotheses is taking place based on the results of observing the sample function through the point in time t = T: Ho (A. = 0) or H t (A. = 1). As was noted before, the decision is made based on an examination of the likelihood ratio (1.2) by comparing it to some threshold value 1 0 • If ICY) < 1 0 , t = T, then the decision is made that signal s(t) is absent from the sample function being analyzed (A. = 0). In the case where ICY) > 1 0 , the valid hypothesis is assumed to be H t (Le., signal s(t) is present in the sample function). There are two types of errors possible in the given situation. The first type of error is when a valid hypothesis H t is assumed, whereas in actuality the valid hypothesis is Ho (i.e., a false alarm has occurred). The second type of error is when Ho is taken to be valid, whereas the valid hypothesis is H t (i.e., the radar has missed its target). Depending on information available and the criterion selected, an optimum receiver can have various structures and characteristics. In the radar operating modes considered, the Neyman-Pearson criterion is nor- mally used, according to which, for a fixed probability of a false alarm P FA , the probability of a mis~ed target is minimized and the probability of a correct detection P DET is maximized. If n(t) is a sample function of white Gaussian noise and we are dealing with the detection of a radio signal, then it is possible to consider the likelihood ratio ICY) as being equivalent to the parameter q, which is defined by the ratio [3, 4] q=J2E No (1.3)"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Tarl,et! of Electrol1ic Warfare OperntiollJ 7 Here, E is the signal energy and 1Vo is the one-sided spectral noise density. The parameter q is compared to the threshold h, \\vhich is determined by the value accepted as the probability of a false alarm P I:,-t. In the case where the parameters of the signal are fully kno\\vn and the noise is white, the probabilities of a correct detection (P D/-::r) and a false alarm (PPA) are defined by the following ratios: P DET = 0.5 - 41 0 (~- q) (1.4) (1.5) (1.6) Here, (1.6) is the probability integral [6]. In the conditions under consideration and for a given probability of a false alarm, it follows from (1.4) and (1.5) that the probability of correct detection is determined only by the ratio of the signal energy to the spectral noise density at the moment of time t = T and does not depend on the signal waveform. The latter may be intermittent or modulated during the observation interval. At the same time, it is important to eliminate the loss of signal energy during the process of its transformation through the observation interval (0, T). The optimum device for signal and noise processing is a matched filter (for example, a comb filter) or a correlation receIver. The analysis of formulas (1.3), (1.4), and (1.5) shows that, given a fixed signal energy E, you can make the probability of correct radio signal recognition P DET as small as you like by increasing the spectral noise density No, even in the case where its parameters are fully kno\\.vn and the receiver is optimum. In actually implemented radar systems, including AAD radar systems, the parameters of the signal being detected are kno\\vn to a certain degree of accuracy and can be represented simply by their probability densities or distribution functions.

For the conditions under consideration, the probability of a correct detection and a false alarm turn out to be linked by the following relationship: 1 P DET = P FA 1+0:5;2 (1.8) where q is defined in (1.3). In this case, the structure of an optimum correlation receiver presupposes a quadrature channel with an appropriate threshold device. The mathematical models given are a long way from exhausting the problems of the radio electronic protection of radars. In the main, they permit the determination of a threshold value q. Specific techniques and tactical methods of countering jamming generated during the dynamics of EW are considered below. As a rule, they are linked to specific methods of electronic attack. 1.2.3 Mathematical Models of an Optimum Receiver for an Electronic Tracker In the given case, we are dealing with the examination, as targets ofEW, of receivers that perform optimum evaluation of the parameter A, of a signal s(/, A,), which is being received against a background of white noise. This can be a point evaluation, performed at a fixed moment of time, according to the results of measuring A, for a specific sample function. It can be performed over a certain period of time in the case where the parameter A,(/) is a random process and represents an information transmission. The evaluation of A,(/) under these conditions is performed using optimum filtering. The latter, as a particular case, also includes optimum precision evaluation. In the general case, the parameter A,(/) being evaluated can represent a random vector. The operational dynamics of a radar performing filtering of a random vector A, that is carrying information about target coordinates and their derivatives can be described using a canonical system of stochastic"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Targets of Eiectronic Warfare Operations 9 differential equations of state (of transmission) [7, 8]: . dA dt = get, A) + nA(t) A(O) = Ao (1.9) Here, A is. a vector-column of dimension n; get, A) is a vector function- column of dimension n; n A (t) is a vector-column of centered white noise forming the transmission A; and AO is the initial value. The noise nA(t) is called shaping white noise. The filtering device, described by the stochastic differential equation (1.9), is called the shaping filter of the transmission. The processy(t), observed at the output to the shaping filter, is defined by the following equation in vector format: yet) = set, A(t)) + no(t) (1.10) where set, A(t)) is a vector function-column of dimension m comprising the signal being observed, and no(t) is a vector-column of centered Gaussian white observation noise with a matrix correlation function (1.11) Here, No is a symmetrical matrix of dimension n, the elements of which are one-sided spectral densities for noise observed divided by two; O(x) is the delta function; and T is the transposition sign. . In the particular case of linear filtering, the equations of state (of transmission) and observation take on the following format: dA - = A(t)A + nA(t) dt yet) = H(t)A + no(t) (1.12) (1.13) A(t) is the coefficient matrix (n X n); nA(t) is the shaping noise vector; no(t) is the white observation noise; and H(t) is the measurement (observation) matrix fJI X fJI.

U sing the methods of nonlinear and linear filtering, the FPI( equation and stochastic differential equations (1.9) and (1.12) permit us, in principle, to synthesize a filter for the optimum evaluation of the vector A(t) in a jamming environment defined by white noise with a spectral density matrix No. The effectiveness of the filter can be quite high if the spectral density of observation noise is limited. In practice, when useful signal energy is fixed and spectral density levels of observation noise are high, optimum filtering methods, just like optimum detection and recognition methods, have little effect. We will analyze this situation in greater detail using an example that analyzes one- dimensional equations for optimum nonlinear and linear filtering in continuous time. In the case of nonlinear \"filtering, the integro-differential Stratonovich equation determining the a posteriori probability density p(t, A) = pps(t, A) is written in the following way [3, 7, 8]: ap(t, A) 1 {f a at = 2 aA 2 (b(A)p (t, A)) - aA (a(A)p (t, A) ) + (F(t, A) - [F(t, A)p(t, A)dA) p(t, A) (1.14) Here, a and b are the drift and diffusion coefficients of the FPI( equation, as defined by stochastic differential equation (1.9): F(t, A) = s(t, A) (y(t) - ~s(t, A)) No 2 \" A(O) = AO; p(O, A) = Ppr p(O, \"-0) = PprO(A) Ppr is the a priori probability density.

This is more evident in the case of linear filtering, as well as in the instance of an approximate solution of the filtering problem using the current linearization method. According to (1.12) and (1.13), the equations of state and observation for linear filtering can be written down in the following way: dA. -= -a.A. + n'J... dt y(t) = HA. + no (1.16) (1.17) where a. is the dimensionality coefficient t- 1 • The equation for determining the optimum evaluation of ~ at the output to a linear I<alman filter is written down in the following way [3, 9]: d~ \" 2R(t) ( \") - = -a.(t)A. + H(t) y(t) - H(t)A. dt No (1.18) where R(t) = O' 2 (t) represents the observation noise variance no. If the spectral noise density is high enough and the signal-to-noise ratio is low, then the differential equation for optimum evaluation becomes analogous to the initial stochastic equation (1.16).

Thus, for each electronic system, regardless of henv signals arc fornlcd and processed, there exists a domain of critical spectral noise density values J\\TO for \\\"hich operation of the electronic system as a tracker and filter and, particularly, as a means of solving the problem of coordinate evaluation for true and false targets, becomes impossible. The critical values for spectral density can manifest themselves in various ways. In particular, it is possible to speak of a critical spectral density, where tracking in an electronic system breaks down. It is possible to speak about a critical spectral density for \\llhite noise or about critical values for the variance of reference values in a narrowband noise sample function, where evaluation variances for corres- ponding signal parameters and target coordinates are greater than a certain threshold value. Critical values for spectral noise density, where tracking breaks do\\vn, can be determined and then subsequently determined for specific structural variants of trackers. Threshold values for the evaluation variances of signal parameters and coordinate measurements can be found with the help of the Cramer-Rao inequality, which defines the lower limit for evaluation variances of parameters being measured. In the case of a continuous probability density and a one-dimension evaluation parameter A, the Cramer-Rao inequality can be written down in the following way [4, 10, 11]: (1.20) where x = (Xl' ... , x,J is the sample function, represented by n independent random values having one and the same probability density; p(x, 'A) is the probability density x, dependent on the parameter 'A being evaluated, which, in the given case, is a probability function; and b is the evaluation displacement, A* = 'A + b(A).

A,*(x) represents sufficient statistics for the evaluation of parameter A,. , 2. The following equality holds true: :'A lnp(x,'A) = k('A)('A* - 'A) (1.22) In this case, if the evaluation of A, * (x) is not displaced, then it is termed effective. Correspondingly, the variance for an effective evaluation is minimal. The jamming side, when generating a jamming signal, can predefine the parameters for the probability density p(x, A,) of the sample function (Xb ... , Xn) so that the minimum variance value for evaluation of the parameter A, is not less than a certain given value. According to the Cramer-Rao inequality, it can be stated, in this case, that no amount of subsequent optimum processing can make the evaluation variance of A, less. Let us clarify this with a specific example. Let us assume that the probability density p(x, A,) is Gaussian: 1 ((X_A,)2) p(x, 'A) = v'21W2 exp - 2 21tO' 2 20' (1.23) where A, represents the average value of x determined from the random sample (Xb ... , xn). According to (1.20) and (1.21) we find the Fisher information quantity and then the lower variance limit for the evaluation D[A, *]: . +JOO (x - A,) 2 I'A. = 0'2 p(x, A,)dx (1.24) -00"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"14 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare By replacing the variable X~A = t, the integral (1.24) is reduced to the tabular 2 M[(A* - A)2] = D[A*] ~ ~ n (1.25) Here, (12 is the distribution variance of x. It is assumed that it is identical for all xj,i = 1,n. In this case, the evaluation of A * is not displaced. It is equal to the average arithmetic value of the sample function (Xl' · .. , Xn): 1 n A* =- LXi n . 1 1= For this reason b = O. In practice, the variant analyzed can happen when evaluating the envelope of a useful signal received on a background of narrowband Gaussian noise with a spectral width Fm represented by a fairly long sample duration function Tn. In this case (Xl' ... , Xn) are the reference values, as determined using V. A. I<otelnikov's Theorem, n = 2FnTn » 1. By increasing (12, which is the variance of the reference values, the jamming side can ensure a required variance of envelope determination errors for a useful signal A. In a similar fashion, it is possible, based on the Cramer-Rao inequality, to intentionally ensure the required variance values for target coordinate evaluation for any optimum reception (evaluation) techniques. Let us note that, in the case of white noise, the spectral noise density No is used instead of reference value variances. The maximum of the probability function is one of the most widely used criteria for optimum evaluation in electronic systems. Evaluation on the basis of this criterion is equivalent to an effective one (i.e., conversion of the Cramer-Rao inequality into an equality when the parameter A being evaluated enters into the probability function p(x, A) = p(XIA) as an exponent [7]). In particular, this follows from (1.22). 1.2.4 Mathematical Models of Optimum Reception in Radio Communications and Radio Navigation Systems As targets of EW, the greatest interest is represented by models of radio communications and radio navigation receiver systems used to control AAD forces and weapons. In the given case, procedures for distinguishing the two deterministic signals at the elementary transmission level are key to"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operations 15 determining reception quality. The problem of optimally distinguishing the two deterministic signals can be reduced to a statistics problem of checking parametric hypotheses, which, in a well-known sense, is similar to the one that was analyzed in conjunction with the model of an optimum radar detector. Specifically, the problem is formulated in the following way [3, 12]. According to observation results in the interval 0 ~ t ~ T for wave y(t), which is represented by the sum: y(t) = Ast (t) + (1 - A)S2(t) + n(t) 0 ~ t ~ T (1.26) where n(/) is white noise, St (t) and S2(t) are deterministic signals, and where it is necessary to find an optimum solution to the problem of an unknown parameter A, which has two values 1 and O. If A = 1, then signal St (t) is present in the observed wavey(t). In the alternative case (A = 0), signal S2(t) is present in the waveY(/). The a priori probabilities that each of the signals is present are assumed to be known. According to this statement, in the problem being analyzed, we are speaking of the verification of two alternative hypotheses Ho and H t : Ho - the signal S2 (I) is present in the sample function, A = 0; and H t - the signal St (I) is present in the sample function, A = 1. We denote the a priori probabilities of the corresponding ,hypotheses Ho and H t by Ppr(Ho) and Ppr(H t ), Ppr(Ho) + Ppr(H t ) = 1. Accordingly, the conditional probabilities of errors of the first and second kind are designated by The total probability of a false decision about parameter A is (1.27) According to the criterion of the ideal observer, a solution that minimizes the probability of P, may be considered optimum in the given case.· A receiver that implements this criterion is termed optimum from the standpoint of V. A. Kotelnikov's criterion, or, in other words, an ideal receiver where potential noise immunity has been implemented. Let us examine the particular case of a symmetrical digital binary communications system for which the following equality holds true: (1.28)"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"16 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare In the conditions under consideration and according to the criterion of the ideal observer, the numerical value of the minimal error probability P e for an optimum receiver can be found from the following expression [3, 9]: (1.29) Here, r J is the standard cross-correlation function between the signals Sl and S2; r J varies within limits from -1 (Sl = -S2) to + 1 (Sl = S2). The greatest noise immunity (the least Pe) is exhibited by a system with phase-modulated signals (PM), for which r J = -1 and, correspondingly, q=J2E No (1.30) In particular, for frequency modulation, r J = 0 and P e IS at its maXImum: (1.31 ) Amplitude modulation occupies an intermediate position, where (1.32) The analysis done shows that even an ideal radio receiver can be attacked to the extent necessary (i.e., it stops distinguishing signals (P e = 0,5)), given the signal is fully known and has a constant energy E, and provided the spectral noise density No is great enough. In principle, the expressions given for P e permit us to determine the threshold values for jamming signals. 1.2.5 Mathematical Models of Optimum Recognition Techniques in Electronic Systems Recognition is one of the key problems of military radio electronics and becomes extremely acute in conditions of EW. All forms of military radio"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operations 17 electronics involve this problem in one way or another and it is evident to an even greater degree in radar and radio ELINT. In general, the problem of recognition may be formulated as follows [13, 14]. There exists a set of mutually exclusive classes 5 = (Sb . .. , S K). Each class is defined by a corresponding set of attributes. A certain object is analyzed based on the results of observing (measuring) its attributes. The goal of recognition is to establish that the object being analyzed is a member of one of these mutually exclusive classes SA:, k = 1, K. The observation results for the object being analyzed can be repre- sented as a matrix X: i -1 m· J\" -1 n - , , - , (1.33) Here, n is the quantity of observations for each of the attributes; and m is the quantity of attributes Xi = (Xi1, • •• , Xin), i = 1, m being observed for the given object. Each )th column of the matrix (xij) is an m-dimensioned attribute vector for the )th observation (measurement). In this case, the attribute vector with the number) can be portrayed as a point in m-dimensioned space with the coordinates xij, i = 1, m. The set of attributes is assumed to be identical for all classes of targets being recognized. In the opposite case, the problem of recognition becomes trivial. In the conditions under considera- tion, the targets are distinguished only by the results of the observations (measurements) of attributes corresponding to xij. These differences can be quantitative (measurements) or qualitative. For any set of attributes Xb • •• , X\"\" it is possible to define rules permitting the evaluation of the distance, d'r between targets of various classes 5, and Sn which are represented by observation matrices (xij)' and (xij)r. According to these rules, the targets 5, and Sr are made to correspond to a vector-column d'r = (dt, ... , d;) T (T is the transposition sign), comprising q scalars, which are termed interclass distances. They describe the degree of difference between the attributes x~ and xi, i = 1, m of the given classes. A man- datory prerequisite to any recognition process is the creation of an attribute space that includes the required set of attributes X1, • •• , XIII reflecting the most typical ones needed to recognise a property of the targets in the given class. In the case of radar signals [14, 15] reflected from aircraft, it is possible to use envelope parameters, spectral and polarization characteristics, as well as signal modifications caused by individual aircraft features, as attributes of X;, (i = 1, m)."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"18 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare For ELINT systems, the specific signal parameters of the electronic systems subject to surveillance serve as the attributes of X;, (i = 1,111). As a rule, the attributes of Xi are multidimensional random values or sample functions of random processes. The analysis of recognition methods known to date shows that the only method providing a sufficiently complete description of targets being analyzed under real conditions is the statistical method [14, 15]. It takes into consideration destabilizing factors and permits us to quantitatively express the key factor, reliability of recognition, through the basic parameters of the recognition system. Under these conditions, the selection of a decision rule permitting us to establish that a specific sample function of observations (measurements) belongs to one of the mutually exclusive classes is made in accordance with the above-mentioned theory of statistical decisions. In many cases of interest, the dimensionality of the set 5 is equal to two (K = 2). The observation results for the given incidence are compared with the model class description. As was noted before, in the theory of statistical hypotheses, an optimum decision is made on the basis of examining the likelihood ratio ,: (1.34) where Pn(Xb ... ,x n I5 j ),} = 1,2, is the conditional combined probability density for selected ( or reference) values, provided they are members of class 5 j ; and C is the threshold value. . The distinguishing feature is that, in the theory of statistical decisions, the probability densities mentioned are known, whereas, in the case of statistical recognition, they are, in principle, unknown and we substitute not the probability densities themselves in the decision rule (1.34), but their evaluations. It is not the likelihood ratio that is compared to the threshold, but its evaluation: (1.35) This circumstance limits the possibilities of selecting quality criteria. The one that gives the best results is the criterion of maximum likelihood [13, 14, 16]. In specific conditions, the Neyman-Pearson criterion can also be used. Statistical methods for parameter recognition, which assume a priori knowledge of the probability density Pn(Xl,'.\" xnISj), are of practi~al interest in the domain of radio electronics. The task of recognition is"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operations 19 reduced to evaluations of distribution parameters for random values of Xj, which form the attribute spaces of the targets being recognized. In particular, we check the statistical hypotheses for average values and variances of selected normal distributions of Xi attributes for the targets being recognized. One of the basic results of'the analysis performed is the conclusion that it is possible to deliberately simulate any of the targets of this class, provided the statistical characteristics of its Xi attributes are known. This, in particular, follows from the analysis of the likelihood ratios presented in (1.34) and (1.35). In the case of parameter recognition, the task of deliberate deception is simplified. 1.3 Mathematical Models of Automated Systems for the Control of AAD Forces as Targets of EW 1.3.1 Fundamental Principles The simplest mathematical model reflecting, in the first approximation, the principal functional elements of an automated system for control of AAD forces would be a multichannel mass service system with rejects [17, 18]. A system of the type under consideration is designed to service, in a prescribed way, a random stream of requests arriving with a definite intensity. It includes a certain number of independent channels, each of which can service only one request, and a control system, which distributes the requests as they arrive among the free channels. The latter task is achieved through the use of appropriate information support, permitting the detec- tion of both new requests and free channels. It is assumed that any request of a given class will be accepted for servicing, provided there is at least one free channel in the system. In the opposite case, a reject occurs and the request goes unserviced. A full service cycle in an AAD system is performed in two stages. In the first stage (control of forces) we solve the problems of detection and recognition of airborne targets and their distribution among free fire channels. The second stage of servicing (individual guidance) is performed by military equipment (weapon) control systems. In the conditions being analyzed, depending on the level of the groups in opposition (operational, tactical), the elements of the request stream and the channels of the service system are allocated in various ways. In operational level groupings, the initial unit of the request stream could be a regiment (squadron) and the service channel an AAD missile system"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"20 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare battery (division) - a control and warning center (CWC) guiding AAD fighter planes. In tactical level groups (an airforce division (regiment), an antiaircraft missile system division (battery), or a tactical airforce CW~), the input stream is formed from individual airplanes and other aircraft that are overcoming (penetrating) the AAD system. The service channels are AAD missile system fire sections, fighter guidance channels, mobile AAD installations, and other control channels for AAD military equipment. Radar systems for detection, guidance, and target designation provide the technical base for information support systems for these groups on both the operational and tactical levels of antiaircraft defense. These radar systems, in turn, can also be viewed as targets of radio jamming by a group of active jammers, which may be represented by their own mathematical model as a multichannel mass service system with rejects. The examples given justify the requirement for examining the elements of the theory of mass service in greater detail than usual. 1.3.2 A Model of a Mass Service System with Rejects and Centralized Control The mathematical model of a multichannel mass service system with rejects and centralized control is a system of differential equations for probabilities of state, which can be worked out based on the following assumptions: the random stream of input requests is Poissonian, the service time for a request is distributed in accordance with the exponential law, and all n channels are identical. Each of them may service any of the requests received. The system can, with a definite probability, be in any of n + 1 states X o , Xb .. · ,X n • When performing an analysis of random processes in a system with discrete states, it is convenient to use oriented graphs. These graphs are sets of peaks and branches. Each peak corresponds to a certain system state and each of the branches, equipped with an arrow, indicates the direction of a possible transition to an ~djacent state. The oriented graph shown in Figure 1.1 · reflects the dynamics of changes in state of an n-channel mass service system with rejects, where at the input there is a constant influx of requests with intensity A and each channel services the incoming requests with intensity Il. When all n channels are operating, the system services nil requests per unit of time. If there are no requests, then the system is in state Xo. It is assumed that a request is in the service system for a far greater period than the average service time. Before we begin deriving the differential equations for probabilities of"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operations A A A A A A ·····A···· ..... . .... 2# i# (i+ 1) # (n-1)# n# Figure 1.1 The dynamics of changes in state of an n-channel mass service system with rejects. 21 state based on the oriented graph we have mentioned, we would like to remind the reader of certain initial elements of the mass service theory [19, 20]. Real random processes can be regarded as Poissonian if two conditions are satisfied: uniformity and independence (absence of consequences). If a third condition is fulfilled, stability, then the stream is termed most elementary. Based on these three conditions, it is possible to derive an analytic expression for a one-dimensional Poisson distribution without using an asymptotic juncture from a binomial distribution, as is usually done in textbooks on probability theory. The condition of uniformity permits us to state with an accuracy to infinitely small values of a higher order that, during a sufficiently small time interval 6.t, the probability that only one request will arrive is equal to 'A6.t. As a result of the condition of independence (the absence of any consequence) the probability that a request will arrive during a certain time interval does not depend on the frequency and manner that requests arrived during previous moments of time. Assuming that all three conditions are satisfied, we can determine the probability Pn(t + ~t) that exactly n requests will arrive within the time period (t + 6.t). Such an event can occur as the result of two uncombined events: during the time interval t exactly n requests were received and during the interval ~t there was not a single one; or during the time t there were n - 1 requests and over the period 6.t there was one additional one. The probability of occurrence of the first event is P I1 (t)(l - 'A~t), and the probability of the second event is P 11-1 (t) 'A6.t; therefore, P I1 (t + 6.t) = P I1 (t)(l - 'A6.t) + P I1 - 1 (t)'A6.t After self-evident transformations and converting to the limit as 6.t --+ 0, we obtain the initial differential equation for the solution of the problem posed:"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"22 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare _dP_\"(_/) = -'A.Pn(/) + 'A.P n - 1 (I) dt In the case n = 0, (1.36) can be transformed to dPo(t) = -'A.Po(t) dt (1.36) (1.37) The solution of (1.37) with the initial condition t = 0, Po = 1 has the format (1.38) The formula defines the probability that not a single request will be received over the time period t, when the average stream density is A. Using (1.38), (1.36), and sequentially increasing It, we obtain the Poisson dis- tribution formula we are looking for: (1.39) For subsequent analysis, it is necessary to determine the average time fA between adjacent requests in the most elementary stream with an average intensity of A. According to the definition of the mathematical expectation of a random value [3], 00 h = J Ip(/)dt (1.40) o where p(t) is the probability density for the time intervals under con- sideration and the probability density p(t), in turn, can be defined with the aid of the distribution function F(t) for the time intervals shown. By definition, F(t) = P{T < t) Here, P{T < t) is the probability that the time interval between adjacent requests will be less than t.

It follows from (1.40) and (1.41) that (1.42) It was noted earlier that the channel service time is also subject to the exponential law, so therefore the service time IJ.l and the average stream density for requests serviced Jl are related in a ratio analogous to (1.42): _ 1 tJ.l =- Jl (1.43) Let us move on to the derivation of the differential equations for the probabilities of state for the mass service system shown in Figure 1.1.

The terms corresponding to the outgoing branches have a negative sign and are equal to the product of the probabilities of state multiplied by the stream intensities required to place the system in an adjacent state. The incoming branches correspond to positive addends, which are the products of the probabilities of the adjacent states multiplied by the stream intensities causing the transition to an adjacent state. The number of incoming and outgoing branches is identical.

As was noted earlier, when considering the stage of controlling forces, we are solving the problem of target detection (surveil- lance), target distribution among fire channels, and the monitoring of the trajectories of those targets which have been selected for tracking. In airforce fighter control systems, this stage is called long-range guidance. The quality (accuracy) of service is not evaluated in its entirety at this stage.

Practically speaking, here there is no auto- mated control system and each fire channel targets its weapons at airborne targets only within the bounds of its fairly limited zone of responsibility. Service requests (airborne targets) are distributed among fire channels with equal probability, independent of whether the channel is servicing a request (aiming the attack system) or not [18]. The corresponding oriented graph is given in Figure 1.2. If i of n available channels are occupied providing services, then, given an overall average target input stream density of A, the average target stream density arriving at the remaining free n-i channels is equal to A n~l. Targets arriving in the zone of responsibility of the occupied channels remain unserviced.

Calculations were performed using (1.56) and (1.65). Decentralization of control results in the greatest decrease in service probability when the average parameter values are equal to ct = * (ct = 8, ... ,20) and the number of channels is equal to n = 6, ... ,24. Depending on specific conditions, this decrease comprises approximately 15, ... , 40%. In both cases, service is assumed to be accurate. Let us pause and examine in greater detail the question of service accuracy. The AAD system being analyzed performs its services under conditions of conflict. As a result of airforce counteraction, this service is not accurate. It is possible to speak of successful servicing, resulting in the destruction of a target, only with a certain probability. It would seem to be expedient to take this circumstance into consideration quantitatively by introducing the concept of an average stream density for successfully serviced airplanes J.1 *. This should be understood to mean the average stream density of serviced airplanes without consideration to counteractions ~, multiplied by the probability of successful servicing Pss: ~* = ~Pss ( 1.66) In this case, the analogy with the well-known concept of an average stream density for successful shots A is evident, which is understood to be the product of the average density of the stream of shots 'A multiplied by the average probability a target will be destroyed by each shot P destruct [17]: A = 'AP destruct (1.67) To a significant extent, the probability of successful servicing P ss depends on the quantitative and qualitative effectiveness indices of the EW measures taken by the airforce. In particular, when an automated control system for AAD forces is jammed by electronic systems, decentralization of control may occur. One of the variants was considered above (the bre~kdown of automatic target tracking in a target designation system)."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Targets of Electrol1ic Warfare Operatiol1s 1.0 eerY -- 0.8 -- -- 0.6 ~=~~: ) 3 -a = 12 ACS 4-a=20 3' -a = 12 wlo ACS ~:-=-~: ~ ) 4' -a =20 0.2~~~~----~----~------+-----~-----+----~~--~ 31 a 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 n 64 Figure 1.3 Dependency of the service probabilities P serv and P~erv' e. 1.0 serv 0.9 0.8 ~~ ~:!

In the end, all these factors determine the successful service probability P ss . The considerations given show that the probabilities of servicing an automated system for control of AAD forces P serv and P~erv' in the dynamics of EW, must be determined giving due consideration to P ss (i.e., the average stream density of successful servicings Jl *). The latter requires evaluations of the operational quality of the electronic system for direct control of AAD defense combat equipment (weapons). Similar problems also occur when examining models of multichannel mass service systems, which reflects the dynamics of using a group of active jammers to attack a group of radar systems of the detection, guidance, and target designation type. 1.4 Mathematical Models of Automated Systems for the Control of AAD Weapons as Targets of Electronic Warfare 1.4.1 Fundamental Principles In principle, the operational dynamics of an automated system for the control of AAD combat equipment (weapons) can be described using a canonical system of differential stochastic equations (DSE) of state and observation (measurement). This system is similar to that encountered in the case of electronic trackers, more precisely, (1.9) and (1.10). The respective conclusions drawn for trackers as EW targets are also valid in this case. Below, we consider only certain individual issues associated, above all, with radio-controlled AAD strike systems. Generalized block diagrams of missile control systems, guidance laws and approximate methods for evaluating the quality and combat effectiveness of linearized systems for missile control all comprise parts. A knowledge of the issues enumerated is required to perform, in the first approximation, analytical evaluations of the capabilities of control systems as EW targets, as influenced by limited intensity jamming signals, and, on their basis, to determine threshold values for jamming parameters. High level jamming signals that cause a breakdown in tracking are considered in the chapters that follow. Differential stochastic equations of the type (1.9) and (1.10) are used in the case where in-depth examination is required [21]."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operations 33 In Figures 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7, we give examples of generalized block diagrams for missile homing and command guidance systems [21-23]. Missile homing systems are automatic.

Signals are fed from the output of the homing head into the missile control system. This system includes sensors providing information about the parameters of the movement of the missile per se, as well as computer and control devices for the generation of signals to control the trajectory of the missile and to ensure its stability. Missile command control systems can be divided into two types. In systems of the first type (Figure 1.6), the trackers measuring the relative motion parameters of the target and missile are located at the control point (mobile or stationary). The signal generation device controlling the trajectory evaluates the movement parameters of the missile and target relative to the control point and produces coordination parameters for all control channels. The command generation device performs the transforma- tion of input signals into required control signals. Command radio control lines then transmit them to the missile control system. The latter performs the same functions as a homing system. There is a possible variant where specific missile movement parameters are generated at a command point and are then compared to actual movement parameters in the control system onboard the missile, resulting in the determination of coordination signals. In the case of nonautomatic control, the information subsystem contains an additional display (for example, television or thermovision), permitting an operator to make corrections to the trajectory of the missile with the help of a command transmitter. The block diagram of a radio control command system of the second type is shown in Figure 1.7. Its distinguishing feature is that the initial information sources for relative target movement parameters are located on"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operations 35 the missile and the output signals are transmitted to a control point, where they are used by an operator to generate control commands. Radio control command systems of the second type are always nonautomatic. In the general case, the movement of the missile through space is described by a fairly complex system of nonlinear differential equations with variable coefficients. It is possible to research them fully only with the help of modern computer systems. The problem becomes significantly simpler if the movement of the missile through space is represented as the sum of two independent planar movements - longitudinal and lateral. Such a repre- sentation is based on actually implemented systems, where missile movement is controlled independently by yaw and pitch. Thus, two independent channels are considered separately for the control of the longitudinal and lateral movements of the missile [22, 23]. As a rule, missiles used in AAD systems are axisymmetric (i.e., they have axial aerodynamic symmetry). As a result, the equations for the longitudinal and lateral movement of such missiles coincide in form. This latter circumstance permits us to limit ourselves to considering movement in one plane only, with a subsequent recalculation of results obtained in the orthogonal plane. 1.4.2 Guidance Laws and Effectiveness Indicators for Control of AAD Missiles To control the trajectories of homing AAD missiles (\"ground-to-air\" and \"air-to-ground\") by yaw and pitch, the proportional navigation (PN) method is used. Command guidance of the first type (Figure 1.6) is often performed using the combined method, also called the three-point method. In command control systems of the second type (Figure 1.7), the same PN law is implemented as with homing. The PN method can also be imple- mented in a three-point variant [23, 24]. In missile control systems using PN, the normal acceleration compo- nent iN of the missile being guided is proportional to the line of sight rate CO of the target. Accordingly, the coordination equation fl., which determines the trajectory control algorithm for the missile, can be written in the two following equivalent variants [23]: fl. = Nco -iN (1.71 ) (1.72) *Formula numbers (1.68-1.70) are unused and intentionally left blank."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"36 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare where N and No are proportionality coefficients; and Vap is the closing velocity of the missile on the target (aircraft). Figure 1.8 shows a kinematic diagram of the movement in one plane of a homing missile m relative to a target ( airplane) a in a system of coordinates with an origin at point A. The coordinates of the missile and target are fixed at a certain moment in time t, corresponding to: the closing velocity vector Vap; the velocity vectors of the target and missile Va and VIII; the distance between them D; the angles e and \\jI reckoned from a certain fixed (gyro stabilized) direction AA and determining the orientation of the target line of sight ma and the velocity vector VIII; and q, which is the yaw angle of the missile. The missile's relative velocity vector VreJ in a system of coordinates with its origin at point C is equal to the difference of the velocity vectors V III and Va of the missile: The minimal guidance error h occurring at a given moment of time and normally termed miss distance (instantaneous miss) is used as the effectiveness indicator for the guidance system (and other systems for the destruction of airborne targets). The miss distance is defined in the presentation plane (i.e., the plane that is perpendicular to the target line of sight). The miss distance is understood to be the minimum distance h(t), where the missile will fly past the target provided that, beginning at a given moment of time t, the movement of the missile and the target are uniform A ---- m m, Figure 1.8 Kinematic diagram of the movement in one plane of a homing missile m."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operations 37 and rectilinear. The components of the miss distance hx and hy are considered in the presentation plane along the axes of coordinates CX and CY (by yaw and pitch), with the origin of the coordinates at point C: (1.73) The value of miss distance h(t) for a fixed moment of time t according to Figure 1.8 is equal to (1.74) where € = 0) is the line of sight rate of the target.

By definition, V T = DO) = De (1.77) where € = 0) is the line of sight rate. Equation (1.74) is a direct consequence of (1.75), (1.76), and (1.77). Equations (1.71) and (1.74) indicate that the operating quality of the angle measuring channel of a homing head determines to a great extent the military capabilities of a missile as an AAD fire system. This permits us to view the angle measuring channel of a homing head as a major and direct object of jamming when performed with the help of appropriate jamming signals. In those cases where an optimum algorithm to control the trajectory of a missile is being implemented, it should be kept in mind that, along with measurement of the angles (angular velocities) of the target, it is also necessary to know the distance to the target D, as well as the approach velocity to the target Vap [22, 23]. As will subsequently be shown, the jamming of automatic range and velocity tracking channels is much less difficult than the jamming of an angle measuring channel. Even when automatic range and velocity tracking channels are attacked, the missile can complete its homing process as long"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"38 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare as the automatic direction tracking channel is functional. This circumstance once again confirms the thesis stated above that jamming of angle measuring channels in modern AAD missile control systems is of primary importance. Fairly complete quantitative evaluations of jamming effectiveness can be obtained by examining its affect on closed-loop tracking systems for controlling a missile, taking into consideration its kinematic and dynamic elements. 1.4.3 A Model of a Kinematic Element in the Homing Circuit of a Missile A component that reflects the kinematics of the relative movement of a missile when it is homing in on (being guided towards) a target (airplane, helicopter) is normally termed a kinematic element [23, 24]. In the case of homing, a kinematic element reflects the change over time of the missile- target range vector. As an example, let us define the parameters of a kinematic element when the relative movement of a missile occurs in a single plane (Figure 1.9). In relative motion, the position of the range vector ma is characterized by two equations that reflect the forward and rotational movements of the centers of mass of the missile and target. Both equations , , Figure 1.9 Parameters of a kinematic element in a single plane. ,"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operations 39 follow directly from Figure 1.9. The forward relative motion corresponds to the equation defining the approach velocity Vap = - D: (1.78) The rotational relative motion corresponds to the equation defining the transversal velocity component: (1.79) Kinematic equations (1.78) and (1.79) are nonlinear. It is possible to linearize them for courses close to those for pursuit and encounter. In these cases, the differences of angles (c - W) and (c - Wa) turn out to be quite small and (1.78) and (1.79) can be transformed into the following format: D=V-V a 111 (1.80) Let us assume that the velocities V 111 and Va are constant and differentiate them (1.80) with respect to t. We obtain: (1.81 ) In the case of the linearization being analyzed, the transversal and normal components for the acceleration of the missile and the airplane are quite close, permitting us to write it down in the following format: (1.82) where iNa and iN are the normal components .for the acceleration of the target (airplane) and the missile; 0) = e. Let us write down the equation (1.82) in operator format: (1.83) where p is the differentiation symbol. By definition [23, 25], the transfer function of the kinematic element W KE (p, t) can be defined as the ratio of"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"40 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare the line of sight rate ro(t) to the difference of the normal components for the acceleration of the target and missile i::l.J(t) = iNa - IN' Therefore, oo(t) WKE(P, t) = 4j(t) Taking into consideration (1.82), we obtain 1 WKE(P, t) = Dp - 2V ap (1.84) (1.85) Here, KKE = z~ is the transmission coefficient of the kinematic element; liP and T KE = zB is the time constant of the kinematic element. liP . In principle, a kinematic element is not stationary due to the change in the dynamics of range guidance D. The element shown in (1.85) can be considered to be quasi-static and represented as an integrator, to which positive feedback has been applied (Figure 1.10).

Due to the pos1tIve feedback shown, the kinematic element is not stable. By introducing a circuit with negative feedback into the model, the positive feedback can be neutralized. The negative feedback circuit contains the dynamic elements of the missile and its control systems. In the case of PN homing, when a signal is generated that linearly depends on V ap , the system remains stable for all angles of attack [23]. 1.4.4 Mathematical Models of Angle Measuring Devices for Onboard Radar and Radar Homing Heads As was noted before, in the conditions of EW, devices for measuring angles and line of sight rate comprise the dynamic elements in a system for controlling the trajectory of a homing missile, determining the magnitude of its miss distance at all stages of its guidance. As a rule, they consist of: a tracking system, including a range finder; a power amplifier; a drive; and transmitters of correction signals. Range finders can be radar, thermal, television, and laser in nature. In the material that follows, greater attention will be paid to radar range find~rs and, accordingly, to radar angle measuring devices. Gyroscopic devices, which provide needed correction to the measuring devices and ensure their stabilization in space, are a mandatory component of measuring devices for angles and angular velocities in a missile (airplane, helicopter). It is possible to differentiate position and velocity correction. Position correction is associated with measuring indicators for angles, and velocity correction with measuring devices (sensors) for angular velocities [23]. Approximate methods for evaluating the quality of control systems can be derived from linearized models of angle measuring devices and other trackers. As examples, we analyze below several actual variants of dynamic elements of this kind that permit us to quantitatively evaluate the dynamic and random errors of angle measuring channels. In Figure 1.11, we ' show the geometrical interrelationships occurring when a fighter plane homes in on a predetermined intercept point [23]. Here, Fa is the target line of sight, e is the required intercept angle, eF is the value of the intercept angle as measured at the given moment, ESL is the instantaneous position of the equal signal line of the antenna of the fighter's onboard radar, and F x is the direction of the longitudinal axis of the fighter plane. A simplified block diagram of an automatic angle measuring device with velocity correction arid indicator stabilization, which provides the homing specified to keep the fighter on course; is given in Figure 1.12.

In principle, the possibility of deliberately changing K v results from its dependence on the gain of the range finder K VF , which in turn is directly associated with the slope of the angle response of the angle measuring device K(1.: (1.102) where K~F takes into consideration the gains of the other elements of the automatic range tracking system [25]. The slope of the angle response is determined by the pattern of the antenna of the range finder F(~, 8), and ~ and 8 are the angles in a spherical system of coordinates [25, 26]. If range finding is performed in a single plane, then, dF(8) d8 F(8) 8=8 0 where 8 0 is the angle which corresponds to the equal-signal line. (1.103) The formula (1.103) usually assumes that the pattern of the antenna is determined using a single point-source. If there is more than one source of emission, or if the source is not a point, then the pattern of the antenna and, accordingly, the direction finding characteristics are deformed, which, in the end, leads to changes in K v. 1.4.6 Random Errors in an Angle Measuring Device The examination of angle measuring channels in onboard radar systems and radar homing heads makes it possible to evaluate deterministic effects. Let us r. eview in linear approximation some of the methods for determining random errors in tracking angle measuring devices. Random errors can occur due to an influence on the range finder of a group of random emission sources distributed in time and space. Their effect on the range finder can be considered to be space and time noise. In the material that follows, the term angle noise will be used more frequently. Under the influence of angle noise, the angle e (Figure 1.11) will change randomly.

In the case of PN homing, the input and output influences in the closed loop circuit are the normal acceleration of the target (airplane, helicopter)jNa and the current missile miss distance h(t). First approximation estimates of the dynamic and random errors in a linearized closed loop homing system can be obtained using the example of a missile moving in a single plain. In Figure 1.15 we show a simplified block diagram permitting an approximate evaluation of the dynamic homing error, which is understood in the given case to be the missile miss distance hK taking place at the end of the homing process [23]. It is assumed that the variable coefficients of the homing circuit are \"frozen.\" The transfer function W KE(P) is determined using (1.84) (Figure 1.10) and reflects the properties of the kinematic element. Accordingly, the transfer function ~O) (p) reflects the tracking angle measuring device of the missile control system and the missile itself as an object of control. The output value h(t) and the input valuejNa (Figu.re 1.15) are interrelated by the following formula, resulting from the definition of a. closed l~op tracking system:"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Targets of Electronic Warfare Operations 51 ~(U(p) in<f) WKE(P) D2 h<f) ~el t<bm 1 P Figure 1.15 A simplified block diagram permitting an approximate evaluation of the dynamic homing error.

To have the possibility of quantitatively evaluating the stability of a missile in the homing process, as well as its dynamic and random errors, it is necessary to determine, in first approximation, the equivalent structure and parameters of the transfer function Wjco(p) (Figure 1.15). In the case where PN is used, Wjco (p) can be represented as the equivalent resonant element, which has the following format [23]: (1.116)"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"52 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare where: KHR and T HR are the gain and time constant of the equivalent element under consideration; and K Hoo = No Vap = N is the gain of the homing head along the signal generation channel of the control system for the missile according to the PN law (1.71). If the velocity of a missile in the homing process is sufficiently high (no less than several hundred meters a second), then it is possible to assume that KHR = 1 and T HR = o. Then the transfer function ~HC(P) can be repre- sented using the expression: ( 1.117) where T 300 = K1v is the equivalent time constant of the measuring instrument for the line of sight rate; T KE = 2 B is the time constant of the kinematic element (1.84); and KKE = 2~ is th~ gain of the kinematic element.

Accordingly, it is necessary to make a characteristic equation for the system and define the conditions for which its coefficients are positive.

At the input to the homing circuit, we have the action of the random line of sight rate eq;. The dynamic element with the transfer function W}ro(p) is equivalent to a group of dynamic elements representing a radar homing head, a flight control system or a missile as an object of control. The transfer function of the kinematic element W KE(P) is determined using (1.81) and (1.84), whereiNa = 0 andiNcp is substituted for iN.

As an example, let us consider the case when the hit probability can be determined using the diagram proposed by A. N. I<olmogorov.

We understand the presentation plane to be a plane perpendicular to the line of sight of the target and passing through its center of mass ( or other conditional center).

Using analogous diagrams, it is possible to define linearized models of AAD missile command guidance systems and other electronic systems for the control of weapons. Some of the results obtained can be used directly. In particular, this is valid for the linearized angle measuring tool model. It can be used when examining automatic tracking channels for range and velocity. The combined analysis of tracking radar sensors for direction, range, and velocity permits us to define mathematical models of radar sights for antiaircraft artillery com- plexes, mobile antiaircraft installations, and also radar sights for AAD fighter planes viewed as EW targets. In conclusion, we would like to formulate some general considerations showing the desirability of using linearized models of trackers for radio electronic systems that control weapons (military equipment) viewed as targets of radio jamming. With the exception of certain specific cases where nonlinearity must be considered as a matter of principle (for example, when evaluating conditions of tracking failure), it can be stated that the degree of jamming needed to attack the tracking system of a linearized tracking system, at the input to an initial tracking system with nonlinearities, is sufficient to attack it, provided that the intensity of jamming at the input is maintained within the limits of the linear part. In other words, if the jamming effect needed at the input to a tracking system to provide the required degree of jamming has been defined within the limits of its linearized part, then the consideration of effects generated by additional jamming influences in the area of nonlinearities will not, as a rule, lead to a reduction in the overall jamming effect."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"58 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare References [1] Simonyan, R.

At the present time, the basic means of electronic attack in the radio frequency band is the use of various jamming signals that directly affect electronic systems. These signals are deliberate electromagnetic emissions with the appropriate amplitude, frequency, phase, polarization, space and time characteristics. Practically speaking, jamming signals are·produced by jammers (electronic attack systems). In a given electronic environment, jammers are used in particular ways depending on the specifics of the targets being jammed and the capabilities of the jammers. In the general case, electronic attack systems comprise an information support and control system, a subsystem for producing jamming signals, high-frequency amplifiers and generators with modulators, and antenna devices. ELINT systems, knowledge bases and computer data that enter into the EW complex serve as the basis for the information support and control system.

By comparing signals coming in from ELINT and a priori information contained in the knowledge base and computer data: • The electronic environment is evaluated; • The jamming target is determined, as well as the type and parameters of the jamming signal needed; • A means of attacking the jamming target is selected and executed. In specific cases, there can be other variants for the structure and functioning of jamming. Jamming methods are determined by the characteristics of the jamming targets and the abilities of jammers to cause information damage to the victim, given specific conditions of the operational and tactical environment. As was noted earlier, by information damage we mean the quantity of information that the attacked side loses during a specific time interval as a result of the effect of jamming or other EW measures. In the specific case where radar is being attacked by jamming, the magnitude of the information damage corresponds to the size of the corridor jammed. Thus, jamming signals, as well as systems and techniques of jamming, can be considered to be the basic elements of electronic attack. Mathematical models serve as the point of departure for quantitative evaluation of jamming effects and the definition of criteria for jamming. 2.2 Mathematical Models of Jamming Signals 2.2.1 Fundamental Principles Three types of jamming signals have been defined to date: destructive, masking and deception. They also occur in combinations. As a rule, masking and deception jamming signals are additive (i.e., they combine with the useful signal in the victim receiver). Destructive jamming signals are implemented using deliberate high- energy electromagnetic radiation [1, 2]. The effect of destructive jamming signals is to cause irreversible damage to input components in the receivers of the targets being jammed. This damage remains even after the jamming operation has finished. In order to restore the receiver or other device, it is necessary to replace (or repair) the damaged component. Masking jamming signals, acting on the receiver in combination with the useful signal, exclude or, to a significant extent, hinder the decision about"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 63 detection and recognition (classification) of useful signals at the input to the receiver. In this case, the effects of jamming are reversible. After jamming operations end, the properties of the receiver are restored. The basic parameters of deception jamming signals are intentionally made to appear like the signal parameters of the targets being simulated, which can result, for example, in the victim systems for control of forces and weapons being redirected from the real targets to false ones. Just as with masking jamming, deception jamming signals donot directly cause irrever- sible changes in the targets being jammed. The latter circumstance permits the side being jammed to exclude or attenuate the jamming effect by using the differences between the jamming and useful signals that result from specific circuits in the jamming devices generating them, and also the way they are used in the dynamics of EW. For this reason it is necessary to analyze the question of radio signal parameters in greater detail. When it is far enough from the emission source, any radio signal can be considered locally to be a plane wave with lateral fluctuations in the electromagnetic field with respect to their direction of propagation (the Umov-Poynting vector), as represented by their electrical and magnetic vectors. A monochromatic linearly polarized plane wave at a sufficiently great distance D from the emission source can be represented analytically in the following way (Figure 2.1): E = Eo cos(mt - kD - cp) H = Ho cos(mt - kD - cp) (2.1) Correspondingly, here E and H are the electrical and magnetic vectors; and Eo and Ho are the complex amplitudes (envelopes) E and H in the section being analyzed, which decrease proportionately to b as the distance between them and the emission source increases; k = 2~ is the wave number, A is the wavelength, and cp is the initial phase; p is the Umov- Poynting vector, p = !

Figure 2.1 Analytical representation of a monochromatic linearly polarized plane wave. Jlo is the absolute magnetic permeability; and Co is the absolute dielectric constant. For free space: Co = co = 3~1t 10- 9 F /111 In a number of cases, the polarization of a plane sinusoidal electro- magnetic wave can be ellipticaL In particular, this is characteristic of jamming signals meant for the jamming of electronic systems with random polarization. Elliptical polarization occurs when the electrical (or magnetic) vector is the sum of two orthogonal sinusoidal components shifted in phase by an angle o. Accordingly, for a locally plane wave in the section being analyzed, the electrical vector E can be represented as the sum of two orthogonal components Eib and Ee with amplitudes EibO and E eo , where Eib = EibO cos(rot - kD) Ee = Eeo cos( rot - kD - 0) (2.4)"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 65 The equations (2.4) can be solved relative to COS(Olt - kD) and sin(Olt - kD): Eill -E = COS(Olt - kD) iIlO ( Ee Eill ) 1 . - - -cos 0 -.- = sln(Olt - kD) Eeo E illo SIn 0 Raising both of the last two equations to the second power and adding them together, we obtain the equation sought for a polarized ellipse: 2 2 Eill Be Bill Ee . 2 -+---2cosO---= SIn 0 E~o B~o B illo Eeo (2.5) which describes the electrical vector E = Eill + E e . The polarization ellipse is defined by the ratio of the semiaxes TIl = ~, the phase shift 0 and the angle W between the main axis of the ellipse and the axis of the abscissa (Oill)' The symbol 0 defines the direction of rotation of the end of the electrical vector along its elliptical orbit (Figure 2.2). The direction of rotation of the electrical vector in the plane, perpendicular to the Umov-Poynting vector, depends on the observation point. If the observer is located at the emission point and looks out along the outgoing wave, then rotation for the symbol 0 adopted in Figure 2.2 occurs to the right of the electrical vector (clockwise). At the receiver end, which is the orientation of the Umov-Poynting vector, rotation to the left (counter- clockwise) is observed. As a rule, in the material that follows, the direction of rotation will be defined relative to an observer at the receiving end. Figure 2.2 Direction of rotation of the end of the electrical vector along its elliptical orbit."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"66 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare Practically speaking, the parameters of the polarization ellipse are deter- mined using the well-known method with the assistance of a polarization diagram [3]. At the input to the receiver, after transformation in the antenna device, the sinusoidal signal U(t) can be represented in the following format: U(t) = U(t) cos( rot - cp(t)) (2.6) where U(t) is the amplitude (envelope), ro is the frequency, and cp{t) is the initial phase. Thus, the sinusoidal radio signal is defined by the envelope U(t), the carrier frequency ro, the initial phase cp(t) and the polarization of the electrical vector. In the general case for a locally plane wave, the latter is elliptical and is characterized by the three parameters of a polarization ellipse (m, '\" and the symbol 8). In turn, the parameters of the radio signal depend on the spatial coordinates of the emission sources or the receivers and their derivatives, which justifies speaking of the phase space of radio signals and its phase coordinates. Depending on the modulation (keying) methods used, the parameters of the radio signal can be divided into informational and subordinate. Modulated parameters are called informational and unmodulated (un keyed) are called subordinate. Modulation of the signal parameter permits the transmission or receipt of information using a radio signaL In many cases, modulation (keying) is performed on one or two of the radio signal parameters. The remaining parameters, which are of necessity present in the signal, are subordinate. For example, in the case of amplitude modulation, the envelope is the information parameter and the carrier frequency, the initial phase and the polarization are subordinate. In principle, sinusoidal radio signals can be distinguished from one another, to a certain degree, if at least one of their parameters does not correspond. J<eeping additive jamming signals in mind, the statement made above can be formulated in the following way: if at least one of the information or subordinate parameters of the jamming signal remains unchanged (deterministic) for a sufficiently long time, then at least one way can be proposed to null the jamming effect under consideration. Let us clarify this statement using the polarization parameter of a jamming signal with circular polarization as an example. The latter occurs if 8 = ~ and ECJ!o = Eo = Eo. Equation (2.5) is transformed into the equation for a circle: 2 2 2 Eib + Ee = Eo (2.7)"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic jamming 67 For the sake of clearness, let us assume that Ecp = Eo cos rot Be = BOCOS( rot - ~) That is, the component Ecp in the signal being studied leads Ee in phase by ~. For an observer at the transmitting end, the rotation of the electrical vector in the signal being studied is counterclockwise (at the receiving end, a clockwise rotation is observed). In order to reduce the jamming effect, it is sufficient to adjust the electrical length of the feeder system in the receiving antenna on the side being jammed so as to provide for a supplementary shift in phases Ee by ~ (or an uneven number of times by ~). In this case, the difference in phases between Ecp and Ee at the input to the receiver being jammed will be equal to 1[, and the amplitude of the total jamming field will be E = Ee + Ecp = O. If an elliptical polarization occurs in the jamming signal, then it is possible to obtain the same result as in the case of circular polarization by varying the electrical length of the feeders for the corresponding com- ponents Ecp and Ee and by leveling off their amplitudes at the input to the receiver. Analogous conclusions can be drawn both for the other para- meters of the radio signal and for its phase coordinates (the angle of incidence, intervals and the distances between the emission sources or receivers etc.). In order to exclude or significantly hinder the possibility of reducing the effectiveness of jamming using simple nulling circuit algorithms, well- known since the 1950s, it is necessary to deliberately introduce elements of a priori uncertainty into jamming signal parameters. Practically speaking, this is achieved by introducing elements of randomness (randomization) into all parameters of a radio signal and its phase coordinates. In other words, the changes in the parameters of a signal and its phase coordinates in time and space must represent a random process. This relates both to the information and subordinate parameters of signals. Destructive jamming signals are the ot;lly exception. The degree of a priori uncertainty in these and other parameters of jamming signals, including their phase coordinates, can vary. This is determined both by the assumed conditions of military use and the technological capabilities of the conflicting sides to develop and manufacture appropriate electronic technology. In the material that follows, stability with respect to countermeasures against jamming signals, systems and techniques of jamming will be called information stability. Correspondingly, indice,s for information stability will also be considered."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"68 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare 2.2.2 Destructive Jamming Signals Destructive jamming effects, independent of the frequency band of radio emissions, can be implemented using radiation sources of sufficiently high energy. In the optical band of emissions, destructive effects can be attained with the assistance of high-energy lasers [2]. In principle, in the radio band, it is possible to employ relativistic and other generators of UHF radiation [1] for this purpose. Above ail, the direct target of such radiation is the semiconductor devices comprising the input components of receivers (mixers, detectors, parametric amplifiers). The heat effect or the rupturing of the field of a p-n junction results in irreversible changes in the electrical properties of the input components, due to which mixers, envelope detectors and other modern electronic equipment can no longer function. This circumstance permits us to consider these radiation sources to be electronic destruction systems and not jamming systems. For this reason, sometimes we do not speak of the destruction effect, but of functional destruction [1]. In the material that follows, we will use the terms destruction effect and destructive jamming signal. Let us evaluate the required energy indices for sources of destructive jamming effects. At the present time, the input signal energy required to cause irreversible damage to p-n junctions in receiver input components is characterized by the following values [1, 4]. In the band from 1 to 10. Hz, the p-n junction in mixers and detectors burns out when acted upon by a pulse of up to 10 nsec in length with an energy of 0.1-1 mJ. The effectiveness of pulses that are longer than 10 nsec depends on their power. Single pulses at a frequency of less than 10 GHz put input semiconductor devices out of service when the power of the pulse is greater than SW. At higher frequencies (greater than 10 GHz), irreversible damage occurs when the\" pulse power of the input signal is O. SW. If we are dealing with the effect of a . series of pulses, then the criterion for destructive radiation can be. reduced by 20 dB. In order to evaluate the required effective radiated power for a source of destructive jamming signals in the radio band, it is necessary to determine the power of the jamming emission P ree that is acting on the semiconductor component and compare it with its threshold value Pthresh. Assuming that the radiation is moving in free space and the maximums for the antenna radiation patterns of the target and the jamming system correspond, we obtain (2.8)"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 69 Here, PjG j is the effective radiated power of the jamming system, the value to be determined; P j is its power and G j is the gain of the antenna; Arec is the effective area of the receiving antenna of the target being jammed; 'Yj is a coefficient allowing for the difference in polarization of the antennas of the target and the jamming system; and llj is the attenuation coefficient for the jamming emission in the waveguide transmission line. (or feeder). This number also takes into consideration the attenuation in safeguard devices against destructive effects; and D j is the distance from the source of destructive radiation to the target being jammed. The minimum required effective radiated power (PjG j )min occurs when llj = 'Yj = 1. When solved with respect to (PjGj)min and represented in logarithmic form (in decibels), (2.8) assumes the following form: ( p·G·) . dBW = 11 + 2D· J J ~n J 2 dBm + Pthresh dBW - Arec dBm (2.9) Let us make an approximate estimation of the order of the required effective radiated power (PjGj)min for two cases: • The target being jammed is a radar of the detection, guidance and target designation type, where jamming is being performed at a range of D j = 100 km (50 dBm), Arec = 10 m 2 (10 dBtn 2 ); • The target being jammed is the radar homing head of a surface-to-air missile, where jamming is being performed at a range of 4 km (36 dBm), reducing by approximately 20 times the probability of a hit by a single missile; Arec = 0.07 m 2 (-11.5 dBm 2 ). In both cases, the threshold value is assumed to be identical and equal to 5W (7 dBW). In the first case, the required effective radiated power is (PjGj)min = 108 dBW (10 10 ,sW), and, in the second case, (PjGj)min = 101.5 dBW (10 10 ,15 W ) (i.e., the order of the values is about the same). As already has been noted above, when the destructive action is repeated multiple times, the required effective radiated power is reduced only by 20 dB and remains quite high. In the second instance, we should note that multiple repetitions of the jamming effect may not occur due to time limitations. In the examples analyzed, we have not taken into consideration the various reductions of the jamming emission that occur in practice, particularly due to the use of high-frequency switches acting on the sidelobes of the antenna radiation pattern, as well as other reasons."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"70 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare The attenuation of the jamming effect due to the use of high-frequency switching diodes (p-i-n diodes, etc.) and polarization discrimination can comprise approximately 30-40 dB. In conclusion, the required effective radiated power of the destructive jamming source must be 130-140 dBW. The practical implementation of such radiation sources is problematic, even more so since the electronic efficiency of super high energy generators in the UHF band does not exceed 0.1-0.15. We should note that, in the optical emission band, destructive jamming effects implemented using high energy lasers require significant expenditures of energy. Thus, for the destruction of input components in thermal homing heads, it is necessary to have an emission energy of 10 J /cm 2 . Bearing in mind the problems mentioned above, as well as others associated with the development and use of super high energy emission sources, destructive jamming signals will not be considered further in this work. Let us take a brief look at jamming actions that cause reversible destructive effects and result basically from the limited dynamic range of receivers K drr . The latter may be defined as the ratio of the maximum and minimum values of the input signal powers, where information losses in the receiver during processing do not exceed a certain permissible value ( P ree max) Pree min (2.10) I<nowing the dynamic range of a receiver Kdrr and the limit of its sensitivity P ree min' it is possible to determine the lower power limit of the input jamming signal P ree max' Under the influence of a high-power signal,. the losses of information in the receiver during processing exceeds a · permissible level. Depending on the sensitivity limit P ree min' the dynamic range of the receiver Kdrr and the distance D j from the jammer to the target being jammed, the value of the required effective radiated power causing a dynamic overload in the receiver varies over a wide range of values. In the case of radar for detection, guidance and target designation with an effective antenna area Aree = 10 dBm2, when it is jammed along the main lobe of its antenna radiation pattern with a range of D j = 50 dBm (100 km) and where the dynamic range of the receiver is Kdrr = 60-70 dB and the sensitivity limit is -150 to -170 dB W, the minimum effective radiated power (PjG j )min required for a reversible destructive effect varies in a range of -20 to +20 dBW. When the sensitivity of the receiver is degraded, the minimum effective radiated power increases accordingly."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 71 Thus, for a sensitivity of -100 dBW, we obtain: (PjGj)min = 70 dBW (10 7 W). Accordingly, in order to ensure the jamming of a radar along the sidelobes of its antenna radiation pattern at a level of -30 dB, the effective radiated power must be increased to 10 and 50 dBW. If we are jamming a radar homing head with Kdrr = 90-100 dB and Precmin = -150 dBW with a range of D j = 36 dBm (4 km) along the main lobe of the antenna radiation pattern, then the required effective radiated power PjG j must not be less than 24-34 dBW (250-2500W). In the latter case (self-protection), it is necessary to keep in mind the possibility that the missile will home in on the jamming emISSIon source. Based on what has been said, it is possible to come to a conclusion about the limited potential of reversible destructive jamming actions of the type considered. As will be shown in the material that follows, situations can arise in the dynamics of EW where reversible destructive effects can significantly increase the information damage, and this· circum- stance should be kept in mind. In the material that follows, our basic attention is devoted to the analysis of deception and masking jamming signals. 2.2.3 Mathematical Models of Masking and Deception Jamming Signals Depending on technological capabilities, the specifics of the countermea- sures implemented in jamming targets, and the techniques of jamming selected, jamming signals can be continuous in time or pulse, distributed in space or concentrated, and modulated or unmodulated. According to what was said earlier, in all the mentioned variants of jamming. signals, as well as in others, there must be a suitable degree of randomization both for information and subordinate parameters of jamming signals and for their phase coordinates. Thus, as the basis for models of jamming signals, be they masking or deception, it is necessary to use mathematical models represent- ing sample functions in time and space of random processes with structures that vary to reflect the specifics of the parameters of the jamming targets being presented. 2.2.4 Unmodulated Frequency and Time Masking Jamming Signals In many cases, unmodulated forward noise masking jamming signals can be represented in time using a model of white noise. In particular, this occurs when the spectrum width of the jamming signal D.!J significantly exceeds that of the useful signal D.1s."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"72 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare A mathematical model of white noise can be derived by converting limits from Gaussian noise with a uniform spectrum, defined in the domain of positive frequencies (0, Ii), to Gaussian noise with a uniform spectrum, defined for the entire frequency band (-Ii, +Ii), with subsequent unlimited extension of the band. If the spectrum of the original noise, generated by a specific source, is defined in the band (0, Ii) and its spectral density No is constant, then, when converting to white noise, its spectrum is defined for the band (-Ii, +Ii) and the spectral density will also be constant, but equal to ~o (Figure 2.3). As an initial sample function, let us analyze a Gaussian noise of duration T(/o ~ 1 ~ 10 + T) defined in the frequency band (-Ii, +Ii) with a spectral density ~. According to the Sampling Theorem (V. A. I<otelni- kov's Theorem), if Ii T > > 1, then the sample function of the random process being analyzed is defined to a sufficient degree of accuracy by n = 21i T noncorrelated and, for a Gaussian process, independent one- dimensioned random values (voltage and current) with a mathematical expectation equal to zero and identical variances D j = (52.

White noise is O-correlated. Using expressions (2.11), (2.14), (2.18) and (2.19), we can define a model for white noise with the required degree of accuracy, provided n = 2fn T »1. This condition is not always fulfilled in real masking jamming signals. In this case, the formula for the sample function of a jamming signal of duration T, in the form of a sum of noncorrelated random values, can be obtained with the help of the I<arhunen-Loeve Expansion (canonical expansion), which is a Fourier series of a special type [5-7]. The initial element in the operation mentioned is the expansion of the function u(t) into a series of orthonormal components /;(t). In this case, U(t) = LUi /;(t) (2.21) where Ui is the expansion coefficient and .Ii(t) is a system of real ortho- normal functions in the interval 0 < t < T.

As a result of their operation, they can (potentially) exclude the possibility of receiving information for a certain period of time in a particular frequency band. One of the most important tasks of jamming is the creation of conditions where the side being jammed is deprived of the possibility of, or significantly impaired from, receiving information from a certain area in space or in a given range of solid angles for a definite period time. This task can be solved using space. and time jamming signals. For example, practically speaking, space and time masking jamming signals can be obtained by using point radiation sources of the required density located within the limits of a given solid angle. If the energy intensity index for frequency and time jamming is their spectral density with a dimension of Watt/Hertz, then the corresponding index for space and time jamming is their angular (space) density with a dimension of Watt/steradian. Depending on the specific problem, sources of jamming emissions distrib- uted within the limits of a given area in space (or solid angle) can be of various types. In the case w here a radar system is being jammed from sufficiently distant positions, these can be, for example, stationary sources of frequency and time masking jamming. In the general case, the randomization of both jamming emissions and the coordinates of their sources must be provided for in such a way as to ensure the required stability with respect to countermeasures by the side being jammed. Let us clarify what has been said based on one of the simplest examples: the generation of space and time jamming using emission sources. Let us assume that n quasisinusoidal jamming sources with identical amplitudes Eo and random phases *j have been placed in a range of angles (-ifJ j /2, +ifJ j /2) at equal angular intervals f:l.ifJ j and at the same distance, distributed uniformly with an interval of ( -1t, +1t). Furthermore, let us assume that the angular interval f:l. ifJ j does not exceed the width of the main lobe (ifJ o . s ) of the antenna radiation pattern of the receiver being jammed, at a level of - 3 dB. Then the voltage u( ifJ;, t) at the input to the receiver in the case where the maximum antenna radiation pattern lies within the limits of angles (-ifJ j /2, +ifJ j /2), Figure 2.4, is defined by the following expression:"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"80 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare I I K,+K,.=n • • • • • • • • ~ J I I I-----Io--I----Io~_I_---If-----f---+-__+ 1 0 0 d B ~ I----+--\"\"\"--l.....t----+--+--J--.---+ 0ll-\\-t-\\-+--+--II----1 Fix) = .

If<1>;,j = 0, then F(<Pi,j) = 1. Normally, when ~<Pj ~ <p o . s , besides the basic source, for which F( <P j) is close to one, two or three additional sources to the left or right of its maximum antenna radiation pattern are taken into consideration depending on the level of attenuation of its side lobes. It follows from (2.42) and Figure 2.4 that, when the angle <Pi changes in the interval (-<P j /2, +<1>j/2) under examination, the value of u( <P\" t) remains without significant changes. This, in principle, excludes the possibility of the side being jammed obtaining information about the angular coordinates of the enemy target in the interval of angles <P; being analyzed. The special feature of the scheme being considered is its deterministic nature when the number of jamming sources n is small. The angular coordinates of each of them can be determined. This permits the side being jammed, for example, to reduce the effectiveness of the jamming operation by using an adaptive phased antenna array. It is· possible to increase or maintain the degree of the jamming effect either by increasing the angular density of jamming sources n ~ 00, or, in accordance with the principle stated above, by randomizing their angular coordinates. The latter, in the given conditions, amounts to a random (more precisely pseudo- random) dislocation of sources within the limits of the given range of angles and the turning of each of them on at random moments of time and with random time intervals of operation. This randomness in the operating time of jamming sources causes random modification in time and angles of the jamming radiation arriving at the antenna of the victim receiver. Time and space jamming signals of this type are called angle noise. The spectral density of angle noise has a dimensionality of rad 2 /Hertz (grad 2 /Hertz). The simplest example of angle noise is a jamming signal generated . by two jamming sources, switched according to a random law, symmetrically distributed"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"82 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare along the axis of the ordinates at angles tP j and -tP j (Figure 2.5). If the distribution law for the number of intersections with the axis of the abscissae is random, then such signals are normally termed telegraph signals. The simplest model of a telegraph signal occurs when the number of zero-level intersections with the signal being observed is distributed according to a Poissonian distribution. In this case, according to (1.39), the probability that, within time t, exactly n zero-level intersections (i.e., n emission source switches) should occur, P n(t) is equal to: (vt)n Pn(t) = -, exp( -vt) n. (2.43) where V is the average number of emission source switches over the unit of time (v, ;). The correlation function Rq; ( 't) and the spectral density S q; ( (0) of a telegraph signal of the type being analyzed are known [9-11].

In step two, the spectral density S ~~ ( Q)) we are seeking is determined using of the I<hinchin-Wiener transformation.

In the general case, the spectral density of angle noise can be found by simulation modeling methods using a fast Fourier transform. 2.2.6 Modulated Frequency and Time Masking Jamming Signals If we ignore the polarization, which can be considered separately, then the model of a quasi sinusoidal jamming wave U,,(t) can serve as the initial concept for building models of frequency and time masking jamming: (2.54) The parameters Un(t) and \",)(t) change slowly when compared to cos rot of the time function. Depending on which parameter of the signal is modulated (keyed), we can distinguish amplitude, phase and frequency noise modulation, as well as phase modulation of a random telegraph signal. There exist various combined types of modulation (keying). In the case of jamming signals obtained with the help of amplitude noise modulation [10, 14], (2.55) where U a = C011S! is the amplitude of the modulated carrier wave; ~(t) is the random modulation process (lnodulating noise); and 111 AM is the effective coefficient of the amplitude noise modulation: _ cr~ IllA~'1 =- h (2.56)"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"86 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare O'l; is the effective (mean square) value of the modulating noise; and h is the limiting level for the maximum values of the modulating noise. The modulating noise is limited to provide a sufficient (on the average) depth of modulation in the carrier wave, keeping in mind the conditions of generation actually implemented in the transmitter being modulated. If the modulating noise is not limited, then the modulation of the carrier wave will not be deep (on the average) and the majority of the power will be concentrated on the carrier frequency. The form of the spectrum of the modulated wave, when the values of flJAM are suitable, reproduces the form of the spectrum of the modulating wave. Besides the sidetones, the spectrum of the modulated wave also contains a discrete component on the carrier wave. The width of the spectrum of the modulated wave IlF j is equal to double the value of the width of the spectrum of the modulating noise tlF JM , if the latter occupies a frequency band from 0 to tlF JM : (2.57) The modulated parameter \"'j(t) of the carrier wave, in the case of phase modulation of the noise and linearity of the modulation characteristic, can be represented in the following way [10]: \"'(I) = 111PlvI~(/) (2.58) where flJpM is the slope of the modulation characteristic of the phase modulator; and ~(/) is the modulating noise with a variance O'~ and a zero mathematical expectation. Correspondingly, the sinusoidal wave, phase modulated by noise, has the following appearance: (2.59) If the modulating noise ~(/) is a stationary Gaussian random process, then the correlation function of the phase-modulated sinusoidal wave will have the form [10]: (2.60) where r~ ('t) is the standard correlation function of the modulating process. The spectral density of the phase-modulated masking jamming signal using noise can be determined with the assistance of the Khinchin- Wiener"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 87 transformation. However, in the general case, the expression for the spectral density S PM( co) turns out to be rather unwieldy. In practice, frequently only two extreme cases are of interest: to be more precise, when mpMcr~ « 1 and mpMcr~ » 1. In the first case [10], (2.61 ) Here, S ~ (co - coo) is the spectral density of the modulating process ~(t), and O(co - coo) is the O-function. The distribution of the spectral density in the given case is near to that which occurs in the case of amplitude modulation by noise. In the second case (mpMcr~ » 1), the distribution of the spectral density also contains a discrete component (a sinusoidal wave on the carrier). However, it is greatly attenuated in comparison to the first instance. The spectral density of the continuous part of the spectrum in the first approximation is described by the Gaussian curve: (2.62) where ~n~ is the width of the spectrum of the modulating noise. It is assumed that the spectral density S ~ (co) of the modulating noise is distributed evenly in the frequency band 0, S ~ (co): { 2 21t cr ~ A (\"\"\\ , 04co4~n~ S~(co) = u~{,~ 0, CO > ~n~ The spectrum width of phase-modulated noise (~FJPM)' in the case being analyzed, can be approximately evaluated in the following way [10]: (2.63) The discrete component in the spectrum of the phase-modulated wave is, in essence, a subordinate feature of the given type of jamming signal that can be used by the side being jammed to attenuate the jamming effect."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"88 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare The spectrum of a carrier wave, phase manipulated by a random telegraph signal, is free from the discrete component. The jamming signal in this case can be expressed in the following way [15]: u.;(t) = l!i I(t) cos( root + \"'0) (2.64) where I(t) is a single function that determines the sign of the envelope of the modulated wave and is equal to +1 or -1, depending on which phase of the telegraph signal is occurring at the given moment of time; and \"'0 is the fixed initial phase. The telegraph signal, providing phase modulation Upmd(t), and the phase-modulated sinusoidal wave un(t), are shown in Figure 2.7.

In the given case, the specifics of a disturbance become clear when analyzing the effect of the combination of jamming (disturbance) and useful signals on specific electronic systems, taking into consideration the noise-protection circuits they contain. This, in particular, relates to the jamming of radar systems working in tracking mode. Due to the reason indicated, the mathematical models of deception jamming signals will be analyzed below in the appropriate sections, where we present techniques for the jamming of specific electronic systems. Examples of deception jamming are, for example, the signals of a radar system reflected from a discrete chaff cloud, a false target, a radar decoy and a significant part of those response disturbances implemented using the retransmission of signals received, having imparted a jamming modulation to them. 2.3 Mathematical Models of Systems and Techniques for Jamming Jamming signals are produced by systems especially designed for electronic attack. In the dynamics of EW, jamming systems are used in various ways according to the specific conditions of the electronic environment. Jamming systems are quite varied. They basically comprise active jammers with an appropriate information support system. The basic targets for jamming using airplane- and helicopter-based jamming systems are AAD radar systems of various types (for control of AAD forces and weapons etc.). Besides these jammers, passive jamming is widely used, as well as optoelec- tronic jamming systems. The determining element in a modern airborne jamming system is automatic active jammers with an information support system permitting the control both of active and passive jamming systems and optoelectronic jamming systems in the dynamics of EW. In Figure 2.8, we give a variant of a block diagram for an automatic jammer, which is the logical result of the analysis of a smoothed radar environment, occurring at the current time in the dynamics of EW. The variant given for the structure of a jammer permits, in principle, the formation of jamming signals both for the jamming of radar systems for control of AAD forces and weapons [16, 17].

Future EW systems could include an information control system, an executive device system (active jammers, optoelectronic jamming systems, systems for controlling detectability, antiradiation mis- siles, etc.), an automated control system, a system to monitor the functional effectiveness of the EW complex, and an EW operator training system. A stream of signals from radar stations, which, in the given case, are the operations targets, arrive at the receiving antennas of the ELINT devices and jammers. For example, the number of radar stations in an automated AAD force control system is quite large and their modes of operation are, to a great extent, independent, which permits us to view the arriving stream of signals from radar working in detect mode as being Poissonian. The onboard automatic jamming system of an airplane, taken separately, performing jamming of the radar system of an automated system for control of AAD forces, can be considered to be a single channel mass service system with rejects. In the given case it represents a single channel basically because of the limited possibilities of isolating transmitter and receiver devices on a single aircraft. As a rule, while transmitting, ELINT receivers are not able to detect signals from a radar irradiating the aircraft in the corresponding frequency band. At the same time, the entire set of jammers located on the various airplanes of a battle formation, when employed in specific ways, can be viewed as a multichannel service system with rejects. After the radar signal has been detected, an analysis of the electronic environment is conducted and the operations target identified. Then, a jamming signal is generated. Depending on its type, either direct radio- frequency (RF) jamming (direct noise interference) is generated\"or jamming modulation ofRF radiation is performed. Jamming signals are emitted in the appropriate direction by the jammer transmitter antennas. The average emission time for a jamming signal 1; is limited. This is determined by a number of conditions both technical and methodological in nature. The time 1; can be considered to be the average service time for the operations target of one jammer. According to what has been mentioned, the mathematical model of the jammers on a single aircraft, reflecting the dynamics of changes in its states, can be represented in the form of differential Kolmogorov-Chapman equations (1.45) and (1.46), which determine the likelihood of states PaCt) and P 1 (t) of a single channel\"mass service system with rejects.

It is convenient to consider the mathematical models of other jamming systems, including the variant considered for an automatic jammer working in the mode of jamming radar for weapons control, relative to the target being jammed. We will do this in the material that follows. Let us note that the practical implementation of onboard airborne electronic jamming systems and ELINT represents a complex technical and technological problem. It is necessary to provide for the construction of sufficiently precise, high-speed automated electronic equipment func- tioning in a wide band of frequencies from tenths to several tens of GHz and satisfying the general technical requirements imposed on airforce equipment. 2.3.1 Mathematical Models of Electronic Jamming Techniques Jamming techniques are highly varied. They are, to a large extent, determined by the current electronic environment and the problem at hand. Among the most characteristic, we can include methods of concealing airplanes (helicopters) and other targets from stationary (fixed) areas (Figure 2.9) using jamming; methods of screening airplanes (helicopters) in battle formation (Figure 2.10) using jamming; the mutual screening of airplanes using electronic jamming systems; the self-screening of airplanes (helicop- ters) using electronic jamming systems; and the combination of electronic jamming with the destruction of electronic targets using firepower.

We propose to analyze such models in the material that follows. Certain variants of employing automatic active jammers are exceptions. In particular, if the radar system of an automated system for the control of AAD forces is jammed by a group of automatic jammers of the same type, then, on the condition that their electromagnetic compatibility is provided for, the dynamics of changes in state of the group can be determined by representing it as a multichannel mass service system with rejects. Assuming the service process to be stationary, then, using (1.50), it is possible to determine the likelihood of jamming (servicing) the radar system of the automated control systems in the case that there is an automated control system for EW systems (EW ACS) in the group of jammers. If an EW ACS is absent from the group of jammers, then the likelihood of jamming can be determined with the help of (1.60). According to (1.56), in the case of a group of jammers with an ACS, the likelihood of jamming (servicing) the radar system P serv is equal to n-l i L~ . 0 z. t= P serv = n i L~ . 0 z. t= (2.81) where A (X=- Jl (2.82) A is the average signal stream density for the ACS radar system to be jammed; Jl = r is the average signal stream density serviced by a single _ 11 jammer; In is the average time to generate jamming by one of the jammers in the group; and n is the quantity of jammers in the group. If there is no EW. ACS and control of the jammers is decentralized, then, according to (1.65), the likelihood of jamming P~erv of any of the radar stations in the ACS generating a stream of signals with an average density of A, is equal to 1 P~erv = (X (2.83) 1+- n where (X is determined from (2.82)."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 97 One of the special features of attack using masking and deception jamming is its increased sensitivity when compared to other types of armed warfare and to countermeasures by the target being jammed. The latter is due to the fact that the jamming radiation being considered does not cause irreversible destructive effects in the jamming target. This permits the latter to take defensive countermeasures directly during the period of the jamming action, attenuating it or totally removing it. What has been said justifies the necessity of developing mathematical models of jamming techniques reflecting the conflict aspect of the problem and permitting us to find the optimum course of action, taking into consideration countermeasures by the jamming target. At the present time, such problems are being analyzed in the theory of games and statistical solutions. Let us pause briefly to analyze the pos- sibilities of solving the problem at hand using the approaches mentioned. The theory of zero-sum matrix games is quite fully developed [18-20]. In a matrix game, two players participate, each with his own game plan, including a finite number of variants for implementing it. The latter are usually termed pure strategies or simply strategies. All of the player's possible courses of action in the given conditions are his strategies. Each pair of the players' strategies is assigned a number called the cost or the cost function. This is the number of conditional units to be paid by the losing side. This number can be either positive or negative. Let us designate the players using the letters A and B and consider the winning side to be A. Further, let us designate the strategies of the sides and the costs accordingly by A;, (i = 1, ... ,111), B j , U = 1, ... ,n) and a y . The interests of the sides are opposite: whatever amount side B loses, the opposing side A gains exactly the same amount, so the total winnings of the sides are equal to z~ro. For this reason, games of this kind are termed antagonistic with a zero total sum. The mathematical model of the game is a matrix 111 X n, where the rows correspond to the strategies of A;, (i = 1, ... , 111) and the columns to the strategies of B j , U = 1, ... , n): a11 a12 aln lIa y 'l = a21 a22 a2n (k = f,n) (2.84) a m l a 1lJ 2 a 1lJn a/1 max a/2'max a/ nmax (/=1,111) Each of the sides, having information about the strategies of the"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"98 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare opponent and the corresponding costs, makes an analysis of the matrices (2.84). The winning side in each of the rows chooses a strategy Aik' where winnings are minimal aikmin. From among all the minimal values aik min , (k = 1, n), side A selects the maximum aikmaxmin. In other words, side A chooses a strategy A;, corresponding in the space of pure strategies to the greatest of all m minimal winnings. This strategy is commonly considered to be maximum-minimum (Amaxmin). Accordingly the cost is designated as amaxmin' Side B, having opposite interests, evaluates its strategies B j on the basis of the columns.

From all the maximum values atimax, the least is chosen atiminmax. The strategy and cost corresponding to it are called the minimum- maximum (Bminmax), aminmax' If a;k max min = atiminmax = a, then it is said that the game has a solution in the space of pure strategies and the cost a is called the price of the game. The strategies Amax min and B min max for each of the players are optimum for the given game. Player A wins no more and B loses no less than a conditional units. In the general case, aik max min < a ti min max and the solution to the games is to be sought in the realm of combined strategies. As follows from the basic theorem of the theory of matrix games (the Von Neumann Theorem), such a solution exists for any matrix game. Each player has an optimum combined strategy corresponding to the price of the game a. A combined strategy is understood to be a linear combination of pure strategies taken with definite weights Pi ~ o. The optimum combined strategy of player A assures a receipt of winnings equal to the game price a, if the opponent applies his optimal combined strategy. If side B applies some pure strategy B j , then the winnings of A will be no less than a; that is, for the total set of pure strategies B j , (j = 1, n), the following system of nonlinear inequalities can be expressed: 11/ LPia y \" ~ a, U = 1,n) (2.85) ;=1 (2.86)"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 99 The problem is, with the help of the system of inequalities (2.85) and equalities (2.86), to determine weights Pi so as to assure the maximum value of the game price a. Through a simple transformation, this problem is reduced to a linear programming task. If we divide the two parts of the inequality (2.85) into a and introduce the designations ~ = Xi ~ 0, then (2.85) and (2.86) are transformed to the format: 111 Laijxi ~ 1 j = (l,n) i=1 111 1 LXi=- i=1 a (2.87) (2.88) In the given formulation, the problem is already expressed in the following way: find such Xi ~ ° that satisfy the system of linear inequalities (2.87), where the linear form (2.88) assumes a minimum value. This is a classic problem in linear programming. It is possible to obtain an analogous system of inequalities for side B: n LaijYj ~ 1 j=1 (2.89) (2.90) and the linear programming task is formulated accordingly: determine such Yj ~ 0, satisfying the system of linear inequalities (2.89), where the linear form of (2.90) assumes the maximum value. Let us clarify what has been said using a most elementary classroom example: the domain of waging EW to support aircraft overcoming AAD. Let us assume that it is a possibility, with the help of an active jammer, to create an area 51 in space within the bounds of which not a single aircraft Tb T 2 and T 3 is detected by even a single k of the land-based radar systems of the opposing side. Besides this, let us assume that a passive jamming band (area 52) of length L j has been set up in advance, within the limits of which the detection of targets is impossible (Figure 2.11). Further, let us consider that, besides the active jammer, the offensive side has two strike craft (bombers) and AAD has only two intercept fighters."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"100 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare 14------- L j ------ ...... ~ ~~~/ / / / / / Pulse volume / / Potential attack area borders .JFz ~ Fighter plane ~I\" 8 0 r F, ~ Rghter plane Figure 2.11 Using an active jammer to create an area 51 in space where not a single aircraft T\" T2 or T3 is detected.

In the conditions given, the following paths of action for both sides are possible. Offensive side (Airforce) • Action plan A 1: both bombers are in area 51; • Action plan A 2 : both bombers are in area 52; • Action plan A 3: one bomber is in area 51 and the other is on area 52' Defending side (AAD) • Action plan B 1 : both fighters (F 1 and F z ) are dispatched to area 51; • Action plan B 2 : both fighters (Fl and F z ) are dispatched to area 52; • Action plan B3: one fighter (F z ) is dispatched to area 52 and the other (F 1 ) to area 51' The average number of attacks n on the bombers serves as the quantitative measure of the effectiveness of the actions of both sides.

Assuming there is an equal probability that fighter F 2 , dispatched against a group being screened by active jamming, can attack any of the airplanes in the group, including the one generating the jamming; then, in the first approximation, it is possible to consider (2.92) Here n+1I is the probability that a bomber will be selected from the nil n· overall numb~r of aircraft in the jamming area 51; nb is the number of bombers in area 51; and nj is the number of jamming generators in the area 51; and nj is the number of fighters dispatched to area 51. The situation is analogous for one bomber aircraft screened by passive jamming (area 52) and dislocated in a random fashion in a jamming area of length L j : (2.93) where ~o is the maximum miss for the fighter selected according to overload conditions during homing time; 2t is the probability of a bomber reaching the area of possible attacks. 1 . ofnj. This formula is valid for small values of the ratio 2f.o and a small value 1 The miss magnitude ~o, selected during the homing period according to the overload conditions, is determined based on the homing range D j , the relative velocity of the fighter (missile) V rel and the maximum overloadjn.

The range of operation of the radar on the aircraft located in a passive"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"102 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare jamming cloud is determined by the effective diffusion area of the airplane and the quantity of chaff entering into the resolution volume of the radar station. Let L j = 100 km, D j = 10 km, in = 5g, and Vrel = 500 m/sec. Substituting this data into (2.94), we obtain ~o = 10 km. Since we have all the required initial data, with the help of (2.91), (2.92), and (2.93), we can put together a results matrix for the actions of both sides (an action plan effectiveness matrix): A B Bl B2 B3 Al 1.3 0 0.6 (2.95) A2 0 0.8 0.4 A3 1 0.4 0.7 An analysis of the matrix does not indicate any obvious advantages for any of the action plans. The most favorable appears to be plan A2 (bombers in the passive jamming area), since, in this case, for any action plan of the opponent, the average number of attacks on the aircraft does not exceed 0.8. For all other action plan variants, the number of attacks can be greater. For example, for action plan A 3 , it can be equal to 1. The action plan A3 would seem to be less advantageous in comparison to plan A 2 , since, for the two action plans of the opponent Bl and B 2 , it gives a significantly greater number of attacks on the bombers. However, if we select action plan A2 as the only one, then we conscientiously give the opponent the possibility of using plan B 2 , which gives him an average number of attacks on the bombers equal to 0.8 . . Therefore, it would seem to be convenient in the instance being analyzed to select not just one action plan, but several plans, whereas the choice of each of them should be made using a random law with a definite frequency (likelihood). In this case, the opponent is deprived of this known certainty in his choice of action plans and is forced to perform actions based on the assumption that we may implement any of the action plans Ab A 2 , or A 3 • The likelihood of choosing action plans must be determined so that the average number of attacks on the bombers is minimal. As was already noted before, in terms of the theory of games, this operation is called a transition from pure to mixed strategies. We will conditionally designate the solution being sought by S. According to what has been said, the structure of the solution must be represented in the following way:"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 103 Here Ab A 2 , A3 are the action plans; and Ph P 2 , P 3 are the frequencies of use of action plans Ah A 2 , A 3 • Let us assume that we have found the optimum frequencies of use for P b P 2 , P 3 • Then given any of the opponent's action plans Bb B 2 , or B 3 , the average number of attacks on the bombers will not exceed a certain number N, equal to the number of attacks when the action plan is optimum (in game theory, N is called the price of the game). As a result, if Ph P 2 , and P 3 are the optimum frequencies of use for action plans A 1 , A 2 , and A 3 , then the following system of inequalities is valid: P 1 n 11 + P 2 n 21 + P3n31 ~ N P I n I2 + P 2 n 22 + P3n32 ~ N P 1 n 13 + P 2 n 23 + P3n33 ~ N (2.96) The left-hand part of the first inequality determines the average number of attacks when the action opponent's plan is B I , the second inequality correspondingly when the action plan is B 2 , and the third when the action plan is B 3 • It is necessary to write down the inequalities because, in the general case, not all action plans should be used (i.e., they are not always useful). In those cases where it is known in advance that all action plans are useful, in the place of inequality (2.96) we can write down the corresponding equalities. However, at the present time, this can be said with complete certainty only in games where the number of strategies for at least one of the two sides does not exceed two (games 2 X 2 or 2 x n). The sum of the frequencies Ph P2, and P 3 is equal to one; that is, there is always an equality: (2.97) The joint solution of the inequalities (2.96) and the equalities (2.97) exhaust the problem posed. For convenience, let us multiply all the numbers in matrix (2.95) by 10, thus increasing by 10 times the price of the game (N' = 10N). However, when doing this, the frequencies sought PI, P 2 , and P 3 do not change. The matrix (2.95) can now be expressed in the following way:"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"104 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare /<1 13 13 1 H2 13 3 Al 13 0 6 (2.98) A2 0 8 4 A3 10 4 7 Thus, the system of inequalities (2.96) for specific values of the matrix (2.98) assumes the format: 13Pl + 10P 3 ~ N' 8P 2 + 4P 3 ~ N' 6P 1 + 4P 2 + 7P 3 ~ N' (2.99) Next, we divide both parts of the inequalities (2.99) by N' and introduce the symbols: Further, we add to the left-hand parts of the inequalities we have obtained certain nonnegative variables Zl, Z2, Z3 so as to obtain equalities. Then the inequalities (2.99) and the equality (2.97) can be transformed into a system of equations: 13~1 + 10~2 + Zl = 1 8~2 + 4~3 + Z2 = 1 6~1 + 4~2 + 7~3 + Z3 = 1 1 ~1 + ~2 + ~3 = N' (2.100) The task is now reduced to a problem of linear programming and, more specifically, to the determining of such values for ~1' ~2' ~3 where the value of N' will be minimum. Before finding ~1 (i = 1,2,3), we determine Zl, Zz, Z3' These variables can be equal to zero, especially in those cases where all action plans are useful. The inequality to zero of any variable Zi (i = 1, 2, 3) in the game being analyzed indicates that the use of one of the action plans is undesirable. Let us express the values of ~1' ~2' ~3 by Zl, Z2, Z3:"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 105 ~l = -Zl - Z2 + 2Z 3 3 3 31 13 ~2 = ---Zl --Z2 --Z3 40 5 40 10 1 6 13 26 ~3 = 10 +SZl + 10 Z2 -10 Z3 (2.101 ) Substituting these expressions into the last equation of (2.100), we obtain 7 2 15 7 1 40 -SZl - 40 Z2 + 10 Z3 = N' (2.102) It is reasonable to assume that Zl = Z2 = 0 since, when any of them increases, the value of 1/ N' decreases. When Z3 increases, the value .of 1/ N' grows, so therefore Z3 i= o. This circumstance justifies the supposition that one of the three action plans being analyzed is not useful. In order to clarify which one it is, we must consecutively evaluate the nature of the effect of Z3 on~;, (i = 1,2,3) and liN'. It is convenient to start the evaluation in the given case with ~3' which determines the frequency of use of plan A 3 . At first glance, it is the least effective. As Z3 increases, the value of ~3 decreases and becomes zero when 1 Z3 = 26 In order to be certain about our assumption that the equality ~3 = 0 is correct (action plan A3 is unacceptable), it should be shown that t~e value of J 1 is at its maximum when Zl = Z2 = ~3 = O. To this purpose, using (2.100), we should express J, using Zb Zz, ~3: 21 1 1 7 1 104 - 13 Zl - sZz - 26 ~3 = N' The increase of any of the variable values Zb Z2, ~3 decreases J,; so therefore, From the first two equations (2.101) we obtain 1 ~l = 13"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"106 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare From (2.102) we find N' = 4.95 Further, we find the frequencies of use sought for the action plans A 1 , A 2 , and ,A 3 , and the minimum attainable (assuming that the opponent acts in an optimal way) number of attacks on bombers: Pl = 0.38 P 2 = 0.62 P 3 = 0 N ~ 0.5 Thus, using plans Al and A2 corresponding to frequencies P 1 = 0.38 and P 2 = 0.62, we obtain a reduction in the number of attacks on bombers to 0.5, independent of any possible countermeasures taken by the opponent in the given circumstances (given, of course, that he does not use any other action plans except B 1 , B2 and B3). In an analogous manner, we can solve the problem of determining the optimum AAD action plans. The basic difference here is that, due to the opposing nature of the interests of the sides, the signs of the inequalities change and the value 1/ N' should not be maximized, but minimized. The corresponding system of inequalities takes on the form: ql f hl + q£fh2 + q3 n 13 ~ N ql n 21 + q2 n 22 + q3n23 ~ N ql n 31 + q2 n 32 + q3n33 ~ N Here, ql, q2, q3 are the frequencies of use for action plans B 1 , B 2 , B 3 . , For the example being analyzed: ql = 0.38, q2 = 0.62, q3 = 0, N=0.5. The decisions are implemented by each of the sides with the help of random selection, more specifically, using a random number table. For example, if, as a result of solving the game matrix, we find the following frequencies of use for action plans Al and A 2 : P 1 = 0.38 ~ 0.4 P 2 = 0.62 ~ 0.6 then implementation of a solution with the help of two-digit random number tables can be done in the following way. The random number table is opened to any page. On this page we choose any number, located at the intersection of a row and column selected"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 107 . at random. If, in the two-digit number found in such a manner, the first digit is 0, 1, 2, or 3, then we select action plan At; if the number is 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, then we choose action plan A 2 . Modern computer software permits such problems to be solved without any difficulty. The general analysis conducted and the example given show that, for the use of matrix games to be practical, each of the sides (each player) must know a priori all the pure strategies Ai and B j , and also each corresponding value of the cost ay. In conditions of armed conflict, measures for concealing operations, including hiding of intentions, disinformation, simulation etc., play a significant, and in many cases, decisive role. For this reason, more meaningful results can be obtained using positional (multistep) games with incomplete information. Practically speaking, when there is a large number of alternatives (strategies) and the level of information available to the sides is limited, the task is often reduced to making sta~istical decisions analogous to those taken when we are dealing with \"a game with nature\" [18]. The task of making a statistical decision in this case can be formulated using the same matrix lIayl! that was used in the matrix game. However, there is a difference in principle in that the side representing \"nature\" does not undertake deliberate countermeasures against the other side. If the side B represents \"nature,\" then in matrix (2.84) its strategies B j should be considered to be certain fixed states. Let us agree to denote them as 5 j in the material that follows. The choice by side A of the most hypothetically reasonable strategy Ai in these conditions, to a great extent, is determined by the evolving uncertainties of the states of \"nature.\" In order to account for possible losses, to the extent necessary, caused by uncertainty, we introduce the concept of risk r y . This is understood to be the difference between the maximum value of the winnings ~j, which occurs if the winnings 'are known, received from implementing the strategies of \"nature,\" represented in column 5 j , and the winnings ay' which correspond to the strategies of Ai: ry = ~j - a y According to what' has been mentioned, A. = max a .. r .. ~ 0 1-1) . Y' Y ~ ) (2.103) In the general case, the determining of risk in conditions of uncertainty is a fairly complex problem, the formulation of which is unclear. The task becomes much easier if we know the probabilities of the states of \"nature\":"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"108 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare n P(Sj),j = (1,n) LP(Sj) = 1 j=l In this case it is desirable not to orient ourselves toward the maximum values of particular winnings, but to the maximum of the mathematical expectation of winnings aj: 11 a· = ~ P[S·]a .. 1 ~ J Y j=l Thus, it is possible to evaluate the average risk: n r· = ~ P[S·]r .. I ~ J Y (2.104) j=l As an optimum strategy, we should select A* = Ai:» where aj attains the maximum. Naturally, when orienting ourselves towards an average risk off;, we select such a strategy Ai so as to provide for a minimum rj. It can be shown [18] that a strategy that maximizes the average winnings ai corresponds with a strategy that minimizes the average risk rio The distributions of the probabilities P[Sj] are far from always being known. In such cases, a decision can be taken on the basis of other criteria. Let us consider three of the best known criteria: those of Wald, Savage and Gurwitz. According to the Wald's minimum-maximum criterion, player A, based on an analysis of matrix (2.84) and, taking into consideration that Sj has been substituted in it for B j , chooses a strategy where the minimum· winnings (with respect to j) is maximum (with respect to i). In this case, under any conditions, player A receives winnings of no less than W: W = max min a·· . . Y J I (2.105) According to Savage's criterion of minimum risk in conditions of uncertainty, we should choose strategy A;, which provides for a minimum risk in the most unfavorable circumstances (i.e., when we have a maximum risk with respect to j).

In any case, the risk will be no larger than c = min max r .. . . y 1 J (2.106)"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"Mathematical Models for Electronic Jamming 109 Following Gurwitz's pessimism-optimism criterion, the player A can orient himself towards winnings of H, which is determined by the following expressIon: H = m~x (x m~n aij + (1 - X) m~x aij) I J J (2.107) where X is found by the researcher based on subjective considerations, o ~ X ~ 1. If X = 1, then the Gurwitz criterion becomes the Wald pessi- mistic criterion. When X. 0, we have the maximum possible winnings (extreme optimism). Expert evaluations play an important role when determining X. In concluding this section, it should be noted that, in modern conditions, theoretical, game and statistical evaluations are obtained in the main using simulation modeling. An important place in these evaluations is played by methods of situation modeling, which is one of the trends in the theory of artificial intelligence [21]. Computer productivity and the level of specialists determine the intellectual potential of knowledge- and databases for EW systems. References [1] Panov, V. V., and A. P.

These criteria include: information; energy; operational and tactical; and military and economic indicators that permit the evaluation of the effects of the level of jamming signals, systems and techniques of EW. Besides this, electronic warfare systems must satisfy the general technical requirements placed on electronic equipment for military use. In the materials that follow, only those criteria are considered that describe the special characteristics of EW. The essence of the four indicators mentioned can be formulated as follows. Information criteria describe the potential capabilities of jamming signals, systems and techniques to cause information damage in the electronic target being disabled. Information indicators of systems, consid- ered as targets of jamming, also permit evaluation of their potential capabilities to protect against jamming. Energy criteria of jamming signals, systems and techniques of jamming characterize the actual capabilities of causing information damage, taking into consideration the energy potential of the target being disabled. Energy indicators of target electronic systems permit evaluation of the degree to which they are, in practice, protected against specific jamming systems in the dynamics of EW. 111"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"112 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare Operational and tactical criteria permit the evaluation of techniques and systems of EW as elements of armed conflict, and the determination of operational and tactical norms for forces and systems of EW in the dynamics of armed warfare with regard to the electronic environment. Military and economic indicators permit us to compare the effective- ness of systems and techniques of EW with their cost and, on this basis, to find optimum solutions. 3.2 Information Indicators of the Effectiveness of Jamming Signals, Systems and Techniques of Electronic Attack 3.2.1 Fundamental Concepts As has already been noted (Section 3.1), information criteria must permit evaluation of the potential capabilities of jamming signals, systems and techniques for jamming to cause information damage in the dynamics ofIW. The latter circumstance results in the necessity of having a criterion that permits evaluation not only of information damage, but also of information stability with respect to countermeasures taken in the dynamics of EW. It should be kept in mind that IW is more sensitive to countermeasures. In particular, this results from the fact that jamming signals (masking, deception) do not directly result in material destruction, since their effects cause only information damage. This permits the side being jammed, in a limited time, to adapt to the electronic environment and decrease the value of information damage caused, in the case where a priori uncertainty has not been assured. A priori uncertainty is achieved through a priori randomiza- tion of the parameters of jamming signals. This is valid not only for jamming signals, systems and techniques of electronic attack, but also for the targets of jamming. The degree of uncertainty of random events can vary. Quantitatively, uncertainty about distributions of random events is usually evaluated using an entropy value [1-4]. We will briefly remind the reader of its definition and basic properties. Average a priori uncertainty, as related to one of the states of the system and represented in the form of the model X with a finite number of states Xi and their related probabilities P;, x = (~;) (i = 1,m) (3.1 )"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Electronic Warfare Effectiveness Criteria 113 (3.2) is defined by the expression: 111 H(X) = - 2: Pi log Pi (3.3) i=1 The expression H(X), represented in the form (3.3), is usually called the entropy. It quantitatively defines the degree of a priori uncertainty in the distribution of probabilities represented in the finite model (3.1). The adopted measure of uncertainty satisfies intuitive notions: to be more exact, it is equal t? zero when one of the P j = 1, (i = 1, m), and mono- tonically increases together with an increase in m. For a given m, th~ value of H(X) reaches the maximum if all Pi are equal to one other: Pi = 11m (i = 1,m) H(X) = logm (3.4) One of the virtues of adopting this measure of a priori uncertainty is its additivity. In particular, this means that, in the case that the product of two independent events X and Y is represented by finite probability models: y= (~) U=~ the entropy of the product H(XY) is equal to the sum: H(XY) = H(X) + H(Y) (3.5) The result given follows directly after a series of transformations from (3.3) and takes into account the normalization conditions (3.2). If events X and Yare independent, then, H(XY) = H(X) + Hx(Y) (3.6) where Hx(Y) is the conditional entropy (i.e., the distribution entropy of Y on the condition that event X occurs). In the materials that follow, X and Y will be understood to be random vectors: X = X(Xj) (i = 1,m)"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"114 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare For example, after removing the uncertainty of receiving a transmis- sion in a channel without interference, the average quantity of information I{X) transmitted by a single symbol is equal to H{X): J{X) = H{X) (3.7) The value of the entropy in a probability model with two equally probable states, defined when the logarithm radix is equal to two, is normally considered to be the unit of uncertainty. It is equal to 1 bit: ( 1 1 1 1) H = - -log2-+-log2- = 1 bit 2 2 2 2 The quantity of information is measured in these same units. In channels with interference, information loss occurs. Instead of the random vector X at the output of the channel, the vector Y is observed. The average quantity of information I{X, Y) relative to one symbol is decreased by the value of the conditional entropy Hy{X): I(X, Y) = H{X) - Hy(X) (3.8) where H{X) is defined in (3.3): (3.9) The ratio (3.8), taking into consideration (3.3), (3.9) and the normal- ization conditions (3.2), is reduced to the form: (3.10) The entropy of the continuous random value X is found from (3.3) using a limit conversion: H(X) = - Jp{x) logp{x)dx - lim log ~x Ax--+D (3.11) where p{x) is the probability density X.

It is assumed that the vector components in (3.14) are statistically independent. The representation of entropy in the form of a probability density expression (3.12) and the presence of limitations such as the normalization condition (3.13) permit us to formulate the problem of synthesizing an optimum probability density p(x) that would provide the maximum entropy value. In the given case, we are dealing with the solution of an isoperimetric problem in variational calculus. In its general form, the problem can be formulated as follows [5]. We assume that we are given the integral expression: (3.15) where p is a certain function x being sought.

The set of random values X, limited in maximum and minimum values; 2. The set of random values X with a given variance value a2; 3. The set of random values X(O ~ x ~ 00) with a given mathe- matical expectation value a.

J J (3.38) (3.39) (3.40) At the suggestion of S. I<ul'bak [6, 7], in the theory of statistical solutions, in a number of cases, instead of using the formula (3.14) defining the quantity of mutual information according to Shannon, we use formulas defining the average quantity of information 1(1 :2) in favor of one of the competing parametric hypotheses 8 0 or 8 contained in the sample function being considered: J p(x, 8 0 ) 1(1 : 2) = p(x, eo) log p(x, e) dx (3.41) In the representation given, the amount of information in favor of hypothesis 9 0 is defined. Here, x is a multidimensional random vector represented by the canonical expansion: -p(x, 9 0 ) and p(x, 9), the multidimensional probabil- ity densities corresponding to the values of parameters 9 0 and 9. The quantity of information 1(1 :2) defined in (3.41) can be represented as the difference of two entropies H (9 0 , 9) and H (9 0 , 9 0 ), depending on parameters 9 0 and 9: (3.42) where H(e o , e) = - J p(x, eo) logp(x, e)dx (3.43) H(9 0 ,9) reaches its extreme value (minimum) when 9 = 9 0 [6]."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Electronic Warfare Effectiveness Criteria 121 H(9 0 ,9 0 ) corresponds to the definition of entropy according to Shannon.

(3.45) In conclusion, it should be noted that maximizing entropy increases the information stability of jamming signals to countercountermeasures (ECCM) only to a limited extent. In this instance, we are speaking of excluding (or hindering) the enemy's implementing simple ECCM algo- rithms and technical techniques without significantly reducing the useful signal. Maximizing entropy forces the opposing side to seek unconventional solutions. 3.2.2 Information Quality Indicators of Masking Jamming Signals, Systems and Techniques of Generating Jamming The masking properties of the jamming signal being analyzed are reflected in its ability to absorb the concealed (useful) signal that it is combined with. This can occur only in the case when the jamming signal is a sample function of a random process. The quality of masking, when all other conditions are equal, is determined by the degree of randomness in the jamming signal. The latter, in turn, is evaluated based on the entropy value. It would seem that, when all other conditions are equal, a jamming signal with greater entropy changes its parameters to a lesser degree when combining with a given useful signal. What has been said permits us to formulate the following statement. With several fairly common limitations, the quality indicator of an additive masking jamming signal is the value of its entropy defined in the phase space of the concealed (useful) signal. A jamming signal is considered"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"122 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare to be optimum when it provides maximum entropy in a given phase space. Maximizing the entropy in the information parameter of a masking jamming signal, the jamming side on the average minimizes the probability that the useful signal will be correctly detected in the victim receiver. Entropy in the given instance is considered to be an indicator of the potential capabilities of a disturbance to cause the maximum information damage to the target of jamming. With its help, we can only find the statistical characteristics of a masking jamming signal that, when other conditions are equal, corresponds to the lowest probability value that the useful signal will be detected in an additive combination with its disturbance. We will provide proofs of the validity of this statement formulated for a receiver that is optimum according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion. Let us assume that we are verifying the hypotheses about parameters eo and e of two useful signals. Let x = X(Xl' ... ,x n ) be a random vector that defines the additive mixture of the masking jamming and useful signals in the phase space of the useful signal. We will assume the components of the random vector Xl, ••• ,X n to be statistically independent random values with identical distribution functions. This is assured for continuous noises if the spectrum is uniform and limited in the given frequency band, or when a canonical expansion (Karhunen-Loeve) exists. We will designate the multi- dimensional probability densities of the jamming signal, corresponding to the values of the parameters eo and e, by P(Xl' ... ' X n , eo) and P(Xb ... , X n , e). The likelihood ratio for the competing hypotheses has the following form: (3.46) Let us find the logarithm for the likelihood ratio: A(e e) ~ p(X;, eo) log 0, = ~ log ( . 9) i=l P X\" The addends of this sum, log p~;~), (i = T-:-n), form a totality of n independent random values with identical distribution functions. According to I<hinchin's Theorem [8], the arithmetic average of these values converges in probability to their mathematical expectation (i.e., in the given case) to Kul'bak's information integral 1(1:2) (3.41). On the basis of I<hinchin's Theorem we can write"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"ljlectronic ~a~are lj1fectiveness C7riteria 123 ~ (t1ol(Xi> 9 0 )) ~ 1(1 : 2) n ;=1 p(x;, 9) (3.47) This equality occurs with a probability as near as one pleases to one, if n is sufficiently large. The equality (3.47) can be converted to the form: or (3.48) Let us integrate both parts of equality (3.48) for Xl, ••• ,X n go~ng from Xo to 00: 00 00 J · ..

Therefore, P ,...., e nI (1:2) P det ,...., fa (3.49) According to (3.45), (3.50) In order to prove the statement formulated earlier, it is necessary to show that the value 1(1:2) for more entropic distributions of probabilities is less than for less entropic ones. The latter, in particular~ follows from Shannon's 15th Theorem [1], according to which the following inequality occurs:"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"124 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare p(x) p(x,8) x o Figure 3.1 Probabilities of correct detection P det and false alarm Pfa defined for a given threshold value Xo. (3.51 ) where PI and P 2 are the average powers of the two sample functions of the random processes; PI and P 2 are their entropic powers; and P 3 is the entropic power of the sum of the two processes shown. Let us consider two cases. In the first, both signals represent Gaussian noises with uniform spectrums and average powers of PI and P 2 • In the second case, the first signal has an arbitrary probability density, an entropic power of P; and the same average power PI; and the second signal is Gaussian noise with a uniform spectrum and power of P 2 • Then the inequality (3.51) can be written down as follows. In the first case: In the second: -!- -!- Besides, by definition PI ~ PI and P 3 ~ P 3 • It follows from what has been said that (3.52) Based on the definition of entropic power (3.39) and using inequality (3.52), it is possible to show the validity of the following expression:"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Electronic Warfare Effectiveness Criteria 125 Here, H 1 , H 3 , H~ and H~ are the respective entropies. The latter inequality, with consideration to (3.45), provides the basis to formulate the inequality sought: (3.53) where H'(9 0 , 9 0 ) is the entropic sample function of the random process with a lesser degree of uncertainty (less entropic); and H(9 0 ' 90) is the entropy of the sample set of the process with a greater degree of randomness. The validity of the initial statement follows from (3.49) with due consideration to (3.50) and inequality (3.53). To be more precise, among all the masking jamming signals with a given average power, the most \"entropic jamming signal has the least probability of the useful signal being detected for a given false alarm probability. The conclusions arrived at relate not only to jamming of optimum signal detection systems, but also to those directed at increasing the variance of parameter estimates, independent of the potential performance of the optimum estimator methods used. The validity of the statement made follows from the Cramer-Rao Inequality (1.20). Let us rewrite this inequal- ity with consideration to the new designations, anticipating that the estimate shift will be equal to zero (b = 0). Then, 2 1 M[d9] ~ 2 nm ( ! logp(x, 9) ) (3.54) The mathematical expectation of the square of the logarithm of the probability density p(x, 9) by definition is equal to the Fisher information quantity [6]. The latter, in its turn, is determined by the I<ul'bak information quantity (3.41) and (3.45), whence it follows that (3.55) According to inequality -(3.53), the Fisher information quantity will be less for more entropic distributions. Accordingly, for such distributions, the upper bound of the variance of estimates M[d9 2 ] turns out to be higher."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"126 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare It is customary to directly evaluate the degree of entropicality of masking jamming signals and, consequently, their quality according to the information indicator, using the coefficient llH, which is equal to the ratio of the entropic power of the jamming signal P j to its average power Pj: p . llH =-1.. p. J (3.56) The entropic power is calculated with the help of (3.39). In the general case, H' is understood to designate the average entropy falling at one degree of freedom of the sample function of the jamming signal: H'=~tHi n . 1 1= (3.57) where Hj, (i = 1, n) is the entropy of the ith random value, defined by a canonical expansion of the sample function of the jamming signal in the phase space of the useful signal being concealed. The information indicator for effectiveness llH, when evaluating the quality of jamming signals, permits us at the same time also to evaluate the quality of masking jammers. The techniques for jamming generation can also be evaluated using the degree of proximity of a priori uncertainty (security) to that potentially attainable in the developing electronic environment. 3.2.3 Information Indicators of the Quality of Deception Jamming Signals Just as in the case of masking jamming, the quality of deception jamming signals must be evaluated in the anticipation that the task of recognizing signals being emulated against a deception jamming background is performed using optimum methods of statistical solutions, as stated in Chapter 1. Let us consider the case of deliberate emulation of one of the parameters of the distribution of probabilities of one of the attributes. Let us assume that the jamming side knows the multidimensional probability densities of the sample functions of attributes Cl, corresponding to the real p{x, exo) and emulated p{x, Cl) signals. Further, let us assume that the side being jammed makes its decision regarding measurement (observation) results based on an analysis of the likelihood ratio A:"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Electronic Warfare Effectivel1ess Criteria 127 where x = X(Xb ... ,Xh ..• ,x n ), (i = 1, n), and Xi are independent random values with an identical probability distribution law. Converting the likelihood ratio to logarithms, shifting our point of consideration to that of a sum of logarithms, and using the I<hinchin Theorem, we obtain (3.58) where 1(1 :2) is the I<ul'bak information integral (3.41). The equality (3.58) occurs with a probability as close to one as you like, if n is great enough. It can be transformed in the following manner: If we designate the threshold value x, which corresponds to the allowable probability of errors of the first type P error:> by Xo = xi,O, (i = 1, n), then, integrating both parts of the latter equality within limits from Xo to 00, we obtain P _ nI(1:2)p ree - e error (3.59) where P ree is the probability of recognition: 00 00 P fee = J ...

Taking into consideration (3.60) from (3.59), it follows that, for a given probability of errors of the first type, the probability of recognition of the signal being emulated against the background of the deception signal will decrease together with a decrease in the differences of the corresponding multidimensional entropies defined based on the sample sets of the attribute being considered. In principle, such attributes can be quite large in number. In the general case, the condition of optimum deception based on the sample function of attribute et can be written down in the following way: (3.61 ) where Hn ( eto, et) is an n-dimensioned entropy defined based on the sample function of attribute et. Having minimized the difference of the multidimensional entropies, the operator generating deception jamming can only state that the probability of recognition will be minimal. The numeric value is determined by solving the corresponding specific statistical problem. The preceding can be considered to be initial considerations when evaluating the quality of deception jamming systems, false radar targets, thermal radar decoys, as well as the techniques of their use. 3.3 Energy Effectiveness Criteria of Jamming Signals and Techniques of Electronic Jamming 3.3.1 Fundamental Concepts Information criteria permit us to determine the statistical characteristics of jamming signals that, for a given power, assure the realization of potential to cause maximum information damage to a jamming target. In the dynamics of IW, it is necessary to quantitatively evaluate the magnitude of the informa- tion damage caused and determine the energy potential required to provide the necessary degree of jamming of targets for given conditions of the electronic environment. The problem comes down to establishing the dependency of the degree of jamming on the magnitude of the jamming-to-signal (J IS) ratio of the powers of the jamming and useful signals at the input to the receiver of the"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"ElectronIc Warfare Effectiveness Criteria 129 electronic device being jammed. This problem has been solved for specific targets and jamming signals. As a result of this solution, energy criteria for jamming have been established. Based on them, it is possible to determine the information damage caused by jamming. Let us clarify the concept of information damage as provided in Chapter 1. Besides geometric measurements, information damage can be evaluated using the amount of information lost expressed in bits. For example, if radar jamming blocks out a volume of Vj, and the magnitude of the pulse volume (resolution element) of the radar is VPtJ and the detection (or nondetection) probability of a target in each resolution element is equal to 0.5, which gives a quantity of information of 1 bit, then for each scan cycle the radar loses N bits of information, where N = ~ . /»' 3.3.2 Energy Effectiveness Indicators of Masking and Deception .Radar Jamming Signals Following the recommendation defined in Chapter 1, we will select as the model jamming target a radar receiver that is optimal according to the Neyman-Pearson criterion. In the first stage, the task of detecting a totally unknown signal against a background of white Gaussian noise will be considered. As was noted in Chapter 1, the probabilities of correct detection of a signal P det and a false alarm Pfa are defined by the expressions (1.4), (1.5) and (1.6) using parameter q, which is equal to the signal/noise ratio (1.3), and the threshold h. For a given q, the threshold h is fully determined by the false alarm level assumed. In order to determine the dependency of the degree of jamming on the value of the J /S ratio at the input to the rec~iver being jammed, we must transform the expression (1.3) in the following way: q= j2E = No 2(P S )inp 'ts (Pj)inp A/;p (3.62) Here, (PS)inp is the power of the useful signal at the input to the receiver; and'ts is the duration of the useful signal; and (Pj)inp is the power of the jamming signal at the input to the receiver, defined in the band of its linear component; and t1!Jp is the equivalent width of the passband of the linear component of the receiver. The spectral density of the jamming signal is assumed to be constant over a fairly broad band t1!J."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"130 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare From (3.62), let us determine the J IS ratio, as related to the passband of the linear component of the of the receiver being jammed: K = (_P j ) = _2't_s\"\"\"\"::f:l.~1J_·p P s inp rf (3.63) If the receiver is optimum with respect to the Neyman-Pearson criterion and the task at hand is detecting a fully known signal against a background of white Gaussian noise, then the passband of the linear component of the receiver is matched to the duration of the pulse; that is, (3.64) and then (3.65) Using (1.4), (1.5) and (3.65), it is possible to determine the J IS ratio at the input to the receiver, such that the probability of correct detection for a given probability of a false alarm does not exceed required values. For example, in order to reduce the detection probability to the value P det = 0.1 when P fa = 0.001, the J IS ratio in the band of the linear component of the receiver must be 0.62 (K = 0.62). Based on (3.65), as well as (1.4) and (1.5), it is possible to determine the energy criteria that provide the necessary degree of jamming in the corresponding electronic systems. It is customary to refer to the energy criterion of jamming as the jamming coefficient Kt [9]. In view of the importance of this parameter Kt in the material that follows, we shall give its general and particular definitions. In the general case, we understand the jamming coefficient of a electronic system to be the minimum required lIS ratio defined at the input to the receiver in the passband of its linear component, where the required degree is jamming is achieved. In the case of attacking an optimum device by means of masking jamming, this definition is formulated in the following way. We understand the jamming coefficient of an optimum radar receiver using a masking jamming signal to be the minimum required J IS ratio defined at the input to the receiver in the passband of its linear component, for which the probability of correct detection for a given probability of false alarm does not exceed a given value. The jamming coefficient in the latter case is unambiguously defined by"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Electronic Warfare Effectiveness Criteria 131 the threshold value qthresh. Accordingly, taking into consideration (3.65), we receIve 2 K·=~- 1 ithresh (3.66) The threshold value qthresh is fully defined by (1.4) and (1.5) and does not depend on the form of the masking signal. At the same time, it is assumed that its parameters are fully known. In those cases, where the number of pulses n being processed is small and the signal energy loss in the nonlinear components can be ignored, the ratio (3.62) can be transformed in the following way: q = Jznil{c'tc Accordingly, (3.66) converts to the form: where 2 K·= n=K·n 1 ~ 1 0 qthresh 2 ~o= ~ qthresh (3.67) Practically speaking, in modern radar, the initial phase of the signal remains unknown. Besides, when reflected from a target of complex form, fluctuations occur in the envelope of the reflected signal. When defining energy criteria for parameters of masking jamming signals, these circum- stances provide reason basically to give preference to equation (1.8), which presupposes a Rayleigh distribution of the envelope and a uniform phase distribution in the interval (-1t, 1t). Adhering to the earlier proposed transformation scheme for parameter q, we obtain After converting to logarithms, we find K = (P n ) = 'tsills 19P det P s in 19 P fa - 19 P det (3.68)"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"132 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare The ratio (3.68) is the starting point for defining energy criteria for assuring the required degree of jamming, using masking jamming, of various types of radar operating in the scan mode. In noncoherent radar with a low duty cycle, the IF filter is matched to the spectrum of the single pulse (i.e., for a single pulse 'tJ/:ifs = 1). Let us designate by K.io the radar jamming coefficient in the case where the decision is made by observing one pulse: 19 P det K· =--~--- 1 0 19 P fa - 19 P det (3.69) If the decision is made according to the results of observing a train of n pulses, which is normally the case, then the corresponding Kn in the general case can not be obtained by multiplying K.io by n. The determina- tion of the threshold values K for large n must be made in noncoherent radar with consideration to losses in the useful signal in the nonlinear component [10]. This task is quite complex. In the first approximation for weakly fluctuating signals, the jamming coefficient can be determined using the formula: K·=K· X r--- { n,n ~ no 1 1 0 no + y'n - no (3.70) where no = 25 for weak fluctuating signals.

True masking jamming signals, while possessing the same average power, have lower masking properties. To a certain extent, this deficiency is compensated for by an increase in the average power of the jamming signal, which increases the jamming coefficient. The quality of the masking jamming signal with respect to its energy indicator is estimated using the coefficient llE, which we understand to be the ratio of the jamming coefficients K io and K.Jo: K io llE=- K.Jo (3.79) where K io is the jamming coefficient using white Gaussian noise, K.Jo is the jamming coefficient using the actual masking jamming signal, and 0 ~ 11E ~ 1. It is obvious that there exists a mutually unambiguous relationship between the information and energy indicators for masking jamming signal quality.

The energy quality indicator for deception jamming signals of radar working in the scan mode is, to a great extent, determined by the quality with which the jammer simulates the signal reflected from an airplane. On the average, the jamming coefficient in this case must be near to one. Accordingly, the level of the jamming signal must be selected with consideration to the change in the radar cross section (ReS) of the airplane (helicopter) depending on the relative bearing of the radar. The required degree of radar jamming in the dynamics of EW is determined by the conditions of the operational and tactical environment and it's component part - the electronic environment, as well as the nature of the tasks being solved. 3.3.3 Energy Quality Indicators of Jamming Signals for Radar Operating in Automatic Target Tracking Mode Electronic trackers, which provide the control system with information about the angular coordinates, range and velocity of the target in electronic systems for weapon (battle equipment) control are prime targets for . . JammIng. Just as before, the basic energy effectiveness indicator for jamming signals is the value of the J /S ratio, determined at the input to the receiver of the jamming target, at which the specified degree of jamming is achieved. The specified degree of jamming is defined, for specific conditions of the environment, as the deliberate change that is potentially achievable in the operating mode or output parameters of the jamming targets. The output parameters of trackers are their mathematical expectations and estimation variances. The energy indicator for masking jamming signals is defined, as a rule, by the degree of increase in the variance of tracker output estimates. Deception jamming signals basically lead to an increase in mathematical expectations for output estimate variances. As a result of their influence, both types of jamming signals can lead to tracking loss in trackers. The influence of jamming in specific conditions leads to a change in loop gain and, in particular, to a change in the loop gain of the of the angle measuring device for angular velocity in the line of sight K v, which can potentially disrupt the stability of the homing loop of a missile at short ranges. The qualitative definition of criteria for the energy indicator requires, as a rule, the specific analysis of the jamming target and the type of jamming signal, and the problem is not always solved analytically. In many cases, it is necessary to resort to simulation. All the same, certain general considerations as to the expected order of criteria can be made."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"~'ectronic ~a~are ~1rectiveness ~riteria 135 Trackers, providing a weapon control system with information about target range and velocity, can be disabled using jamming generated from a single point in space. For this purpose, for example, it is sufficient to implement a jamming signal that blocks out certain time or frequency intervals. In order to disable the angle measuring channel, it is necessary to implement angular noise blocking out a certain interval of angles. It is not possible to obtain such an implementation by generating jamming from a single point. In the simplest instance, for the generation of angle noise, it is necessary to have at least two jamming emissions from sources spaced in angle. The entropy power of the angle noise, generated from a single point, is equal to zero. The angle noise generated by two sources, modeled after a telegraph signal (Figure 2.5) with an average intensity of V and an exponential distribution of switching times (3.34), is the most entropic among all distributions with a fixed average time t =~. According to (3.35), the entropy of the exponential distribution, in the given case, is equal to H' = In(~) (3.80) The criteria for angle noise spectral density are determined by two circumstances, specifically, by the required value of the output parameter estimate variance, for example, the variance of the rocket miss D hk (1.131), and, in the given conditions, the value of the change!l.8 in the line of sight (Figure 3.2) implemented. To determine energy criteria specifically, it is necessary to establish the dependency of both the angle noise spectral density and the angle!l.8 on the value of the J /S ratio. In its general form, the solution to this problem is quite complex and is optional for the determining of jamming criteria. Sufficiently close estimates can be obtained by limiting ourselves to the analysis of jamming effects on a discriminator with a linear characteristic. The discrimination characteristic can be considered linear on the condition that !l.8 0 ~ 28 0 (Figure 3.2). As an example, let us consider an amplitude sensing angle tracker with sum-difference processing and astatism of the first order, which is influenced simultaneously by two noncoherent determinate signals Sand J, spaced at an angle and with amplitudes Us and ~. The angular distance between the signal sources is equal to !l.8 0 (Figure 3.2).

The analyzed variant of tracking loss is achieved using a determinate jamming signal in a determined sequence. The absence of ambiguity makes it vulnerable to comparatively simple ECCM. More stable with regard to ECCM is the angle noise considered previousl y, generated on the model of a telegraph signal. Implemen- tation of this noise covers a range of angles, corresponding to the linear portion of the location finder, which is of the order of the 3-dB beamwidth (8 0 . 5 ), In order to ensure tracking loss, it is necessary to occupy the range of - angles that correspond to the width of the direction finder characteristic !::18 adjc (Figure 3.3). This corresponds to an interval of angles on the order of three or four 8 0 . 5 , The practical implementation of such a variant of angle noise requires three or four pairs of flickering sources with an angular distance between each pair of sources !::1 8 0 that is approximately equal to 8 0 . 5 , This is in view of the requirement in this case of using the whole angular interval between a pair of emission sources (!::18 0 ) to the maximum extent.

For tentative estimates of information damage caused to the control system when jamming tracking channels for range and velocity a jamming coefficient of 5-6 dB can be used. Basically, the proposals stated above for criteria of jamming signals for electronic devices in weapons control systems assume the placement of jamming sources within the linear portion of the discriminative (direction finder) characteristic. The jamming coefficient Ky, determined by the degree of jamming achieved when doing so, is somewhat too high. Due to the influence of additional jamming interference in nonlinear stages on the dynamics of EW, the degree of jamming increases, which permits, in principle, an insignificant decrease in the value of K j . This circumstance gives cause to assume that criteria, determined in such a way, can be assumed to be robust (i.e .. , stable against change in environment conditions), although they are somewhat too high. In conclusion; we will note once again that energy criteria of information damage are determined by the conditions of the operational, tactical and electronic environment. As concerns specific devices and techniques for generating jamming, the magnitude of information loss they evoke can be shown, provided space and time conditions are set strictly enough and specific electrical characteristics are present in targets and jammers. 3.4 Operational and Tactical Indicators of EW Effecti~eness 3.4.1 Fundamental Concepts The operational and tactical indicators of EW devices and techniques, as applied in the defense of an airforce, are determined in the main by the form and content of military actions and the character of the problems to be solved. Of the comparatively large number of variants of conducting military operations involving the air force, the conducting of military actions by airforce divisions (subdivisions) to penetrate AAD is taken as the basis for defining effectiveness indicators, above all, for jamming. Specifically, the content and particulars of jamming are reflected most fully when solving problems associated with the overcoming (penetrating) of AAD. Besides this, it should be borne in mind that the appearance of jamming as an element of armed warfare was a result of the development of"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"142 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare means for attack and defense. It was first used massively by the English and American airforces in 1943 to overcome Germany's AAD. Besides the variant of the military operations mentioned, we consider in addition the specifics of defining effectiveness indicators for the conduct- ing of EW in the dynamics of combat involving homogeneous groupings of armed forces, as described by differential equations for the dynamics of averages~ In particular, on this basis it is possible to define the required norms for EW forces and devices when conducting military operations using fighter aircraft. 3.4.2 Effectiveness Indicators of Jamming when Conducting Military Actions Using Airborne Forces (Subdivisions) to Penetrate AAD Systems The jamming targets in the given case are electronic systems for control of AAD forces and weapons. As effectiveness indicators, we use the value of average losses in airforce troops (subdivisions) and the averaged probability of penetrating AAD, as related to a single aircraft in a battle formation and occurring as a result of using the jamming devices and the techniques considered [9]. In the first approximation, quantitative estimates for the indicators mentioned can be obtained with the help of an analytical model of AAD. When considering this problem, it is convenient to imagine a single AAD system in the form of a set of sufficiently independent subsystems with respect to operations, which we will subsequently term AAD areas. Examples are AAD areas of military operations, communications areas etc. There may be several such areas. In each area, there are various types of firepower against airborne targets, for example short- and medium-range antiaircraft missile installations, mobile antiaircraft installations and fighter · aircraft. The control of each type of AAD firepower device is performed by tw~ types of automated control systems - for forces and for weapons. The stream of airborne targets entering into the AAD system is assumed to be Poissonian fragmentally stationary. Its density A is consid- ered to be constant while flying through the kill area of the given AAD firepower system. It changes (decreases) in fixed amounts when the battle formation enters an adjacent area. An operations model for each separate group of AAD fire channels (weapons system), together with its corresponding ACS, can be obtained, in the first approximation, using the methods of the mass service theory and the theory of radio control (sections (1.3) and (1.4)). In particular, the operations model for groups of n fire channels of antiaircraft missile installations with a"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Electronic Warfare Effectiveness Criteria 143 medium or long range of operation and intercept fighters can be represented as an n-channel mass service system with rejects. By imposing appropriate limitations on a group, it is possible to represent the operations of other firepower channel types in the AAD area in the same manner. Let us represent the unified AAD system in the form of a set of' areas. The arbitrary ith area in the AAD has Mi groups of various types of firepower systems. The group comprising each of j firepower devices U = 1, M j ) can be represented as an nij-channel mass service system with rejects and with an exponential service time distribution in each channel. According to (1.43), the average stream density of serviced requests (in the given case, targets shot at) Jlij and the average service time tij are linked by the equality: 1 Jlij = =- t·· Y (3.94) The average stream density of targets successfully shot at Jlij and the averaged probability of hitting the target with one generalized shot from the jth device in the ith area P ij' according to (1.66), are linked by the dependency: (3.95) Depending on the type of weapon, a generalized shot can be under- stood to be [11] a volley or several volleys from an antiaircraft artillery installation, a series of antiaircraft guided missiles, one attack by an intercept fighter and other firing variants. In the material that follows, the term \"generalized successful shot\" will also be used. Instead of the average stream density of targets successfully shot at, we will speak of the average stream density of generalized successful shots from the average intensity of generalized successful shots Jlij of one fire channel of the jth device in the ith AAD area. The average intensity of generalized successful shots of a group of j devices in this area JIij is determined by the average intensity of generalized successful shots of one channel Jlij and the average number of channels Kij in the group nij firing on the group of airborne targets in the given environment: (3.96) The value Kij is determined using (1.59), which in the given case is formulated in the following way:"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"144 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare (3.97) Here, A·· y ex··=- Y II!. t\"'y (3.98) Aij is the stream density of airborne targets entering the ith AAD area, m·· A .. =-1L y T·· y (3.99) mij is the average number of airplanes in a battle formation entering the kill area of the jth device; T ij is the time for the battle formation of airplanes to pass outside the far bound of the kill area of thejth device; Lbj(i,j) is the spread of the battle formation of mij airplanes; and Pserv(i,j) is the service probability for (shooting at) the airborne target by an nij-channel mass service system with rejects.

Below, we consider certain techni- ques for estimating the probability Pi when jamming influences trackers in electronic systems for weapons control. The possibility of using analytical methods when evaluating the effectiveness of systems and techniques of jamming of electronic systems for weapons control is a result of the special character of the problem. For the jammer, for example, there are no limits to a miss by a antiaircraft missile from above or the probability of a hit by an antiaircraft missile (projectile) from below. It is only necessary that the miss by missile (projectile) h be greater that its kill radius and that the kill probability (Pij) not exceed a certain value.

This makes it difficult to consider in full volume all elements of EW, both offensive (jamming) and defensive (ECCM) in nature. As an example permitting us to consider countermeasures, below we analyze two model variants of the dynamics of military operations by two conflicting sides with homogeneous kill systems (firepower systems). Each of the sides"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Electronic Warfare Effectiveness Criteria 155 A and B is armed with weapons of the same type. Each of the sides can have its own firepower systems, different from analogous systems of the enemy. The firepower productivity for firepower systems is characterized by the Poissonian stream density for successful shots: A=AP where A is the stream density of generalized shots (the number of shots per unit of time); P is the probability of hitting the target with one generalized shot. Accordingly, for each of the sides we determine AA and A B : (3.132) In the ~odel variants considered for the dynamics of military· opera- tions it is assumed that the following conditions are fulfilled [11]. The conflicting sides have a finite number of firepower systems (channels) NA and N B • Each firepower channel, if not hit, can fire using a Poissonian stream of successful shots at any firepower system of the enemy. The average flight time for a missile (projectile) is much less than the average duration of a battle. Total military might is determined by the average number of fire channels not hit, and not their random number at a given moment in time. In the first of the models considered, it is assumed that the sides are waging a high~y organized battle. Each shot is aimed. With one shot it is possible to hit only one target and, after it has been hit, firing is, practically speaking, instantly shifted to a target that has not been hit. In the second model, the b,attle is not organize~ in a proper fashion. The Poissonian stream of successful shots for each of the groups is distributed uniformly among all firepower systems of the enemy. Informa- tion is not received about the hitting of a target. Both hit and unhit targets may be fired at. One successful shot may hit only one target. EW measures performed by each of the sides can lead to a reduction in both the aVerage density of the Poissonian stream of generalized shots (AA' AB) and the probability of hitting a target with one shot (P A, P B ). Accordingly, the stream densities of successful shots AA and AB prove to be quite small. For this reason, the average time necessary to hit a single target proves to be much greater than the flight time of a missile (projectile) to a target.

In the case under consideration, the quantitative indicators are the strengths of groups' firepower systems (NA and N B ). The qualitative indicators are their firepower productivities A A and A B , determined in their turn by the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the EW systems and techniques.

In the model without transfer of firepower (Model II), the change in the average strength of group A is determined not only by the average intensity of successful shots on the part of group B, but also by the probability that, due to the fact that firepower is not transfered, the shot considered is fired namely at a target that has not yet been hit.

If we assume that the average stream densities for missiles launched by sides A and Bare identical and launches are made every 40 sec (Le., A A = AB = 10 1 I s), then the average stream densities of successful shots (launches) for each side is, accordingly, As a result of the greater radar visibility, the fighters of side B are detected at a range that exceeds the detection range of their onboard radar by 1.2 times. This permits side A to make preemptive air-to-air missile launches from a range of Do = 120 km, while side B can make aimed counter launches only from a range of D(I - alA) = 100 Ian (Figure 3.7). It is assumed that the missile battle ends when the range between the groups reaches 20 km.

In the example analyzed, it was shown that, if we reduce by a factor of two the RCS of an airplane and the probability of hitting it with a single shot during air combat in comparison with an enemy airplane (Kcc = 1.41), side A can, when waging a highly organized battle (Model I), practically speaking, totally crush the enemy in the long-range missile combat stage (mB = 2.64), at the same time suffering relatively small average losses (mA = 24.9). When waging a less organized battle (Model II), the effectiveness of military actions for side A is noticeably less mB = 12.1, mA = 23.9. Thus, in the example analyzed, side A by means of increasing the quality of control (implementing Model I instead of Model II) increases the effectiveness of his firepower by more than four times. It is worthwhile noting the heightened sensitivity of the coefficient of initial combat capabilities to comparatively small differences in the quality of EW measures both as a part of jamming and ECCM. For example, if in the previous example, when all other conditions are equal, the small quantitative difference in the effectiveness of EW measures consists merely in the magnitude of the probability of a hit with one shot (P(B/ A) = 0.2, P(A/B) = 0.16, Kcc = 1.12), then, when waging a highly organized battle, the average strength of the groups after 200 sec would be: mB = 8.4, mA = 15.3. The battle ends practically speaking with a two-fold superiority of side A. Equations for the dynamics of averages can be used in a quite large number of variants of conducting military operations. Model I was first researched in the works of Staff-Captain Osipov of the Russian Army (1915) and the English scientist Lanchester (1916). Model II was proposed and researched by E. S. Venttsel'. She also established the link between the models analyzed and Markov processes [11, 17]. It is worth bearing in mind that the reliability of the method considered can prove to be insufficient in the final stage of a battle when the average strengths of the groups are small and the process of their changing becomes continuous. In this case, it is convenient to supplement analytical investiga- tions with simulation modeling of combat dynamics. As was already noted earlier, under the influence of jamming AA and AB are small and the results of estimates are acceptable for small values of mA and mB."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"164 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare 3.5 Military and Economic Indicators of EW Effectiveness The criteria considered earlier do not allow us in full measure to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of EW systems and methods. In addition, it is necessary to know the required costs for the production of equipment and its operation, as well as during combat use. In particular, for EW systems, the issue of ensuring their stability with respect enemy ECCM is fundamental. Indicators of such stability can be the average lifetime of a system or technique in standard conditions of the environment. Effective- ness must be ensured for the duration of their lifetime, which increases the cost of the system (technique). An important place when analyzing the economic side of EW is the evaluation of prevented damage occurring in the dynamics of EW. In principle, there exists an optimal relationship between effectiveness and cost. As a rule, the more effective a system, the higher its cost. Cheap EW systems are more frequently than not either ineffective or have a short lifetime. The existence of an optimum relationship between the effectiveness and the cost is illustrated by Figure 3.8. Here N is the quantity of homogeneous elements assuring the EW effectiveness (for example, this may be the number of microcircuits), and e is the effectiveness expressed in appropriate units (for example, the averaged probability of penetrating AAD, the average value of 1 e,c 8 , N N, Figure 3.8 Optimum relationship between effectiveness and cost."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"Electronic Warfare Effectiveness Criteria 165 prevented damage). c is the cost of the corresponding quantity of selected elements. It is apparent that the product e~, as a function of N, has an extremum. The corresponding variant of the EW system or complex V opt and the value N opt are optimum. In practice, the optimum value of N is not always selected. Depending on the specific task, the conditions of the environment, and bearing in mind available experience and real possibili- ties, one or another variant (Bl or B 2 ) may be selected, together with a number of elements Nl or N 2 , with the effectivenesses el, e2 and costs (Cl and C2) corresponding to them. In the general case, military and economic estimates require the solution of quite complex problems, which are of independent interest. Practically speaking, these estimates are performed at the stage of equipment design. Military and economic analysis is also required when determining the strength of forces and means required to implement the specific technique of waging EW. The mil~tary and economic indicator is, in many cases, the fundamental one for the decision maker. References [1] Shannon, C.

The latter is determined by the type and parameters of the jamming and useful signals, as well as by the radar circuit implemented to process them. In screening jamming, we introduce an energy quality coefficient 1lE given by (3.79). The magnitude of the information damage inflicted depends on the energy indicators of both the target and the jamming system. Quantitatively, the information damage inflicted on a radar is determined by the size of the screened area, which in many cases is a certain segment within the bounds of the detectiori zone of the victim radar. Along its borders, the ratio of the power of the jamming to that of the useful signal is equal to the jamming coefficient. Within the area, the ratio exceeds it. The jamming equation for radar permits us to analytically determine the form and dimensions of the radar area jammed. We understand the jamming equation to be the dependence of the ratio K of the power of the jamming to that of the useful signal within the passband of the linear part of the receiver, on a set of factors determined by the electric, frequency and space/time characteristics of the radiation generated by the targets and jamming systems; the propagation condi- tions; and the radar detectability of the target being covered.

When K reaches a value less than K.i, the required degree of jamming is not achieved. The value of Dn corresponding to the equation K = K.i, determines the border of the jamming area. In Figure 4.2 there are two such borders - Dsmin 1 and D smin2 • The coefficient K.i (defined below) is called the jamming coefficient. In Figure 4.3, we show the jamming area for various bearings q of the targets being covered, relative to the victim radar and for fixed coordinates of the jammer. When the jammer, the battle formation being covered, and the victim radar are all located at the bearing (q = 0), F:(O,O) = 1 (0 dB), the coefficient K is at its maximum value and the corresponding detection range is minimum. It is customary to call it the minimum jamming range Dsmin. For bearings q1 and q2, F:(~j' 8 j ) < 1 and, therefore, the jamming effect decreases and the target detection range increases. The bearing q1 corresponds to detection range D s1, which occurs, for example, when jamming is on the level of F:(~j' 8 j ) in the order of -10 dB. The bearing q2 corresponds to the range D s2 , which occurs at value F:(~j' 8 j ) approximately equal to -20 dB.

We first determine the conditions under which 'Yj reaches it's maximum and minimum values. In the first case, 'Yj = 1 and, in the second, 'Yj = O. Taking into account the limitations imposed on C/., and ~, it follows from (4.23) that the value of 'Yj is at its maximum when cos('Y + 8) = 1 and at its minimum when cos('Y + 8) = -1.

Phase shifts 'Y + 0 = 0, 'Y = -0. For the case at hand, let us set the mutual orientations of the polarization ellipses for vectors fiE and I1A using (4.30), (4.31), (4.34) and (4.35). For example, let us assume that the ellipse corresponding to vector fiE and defined by (4.24) has an ellipticity 111 and that its semimajor axis forms the angle'\" with a certain fixed direction.

Accordingly, it follows from (4.35) and (4.31) that the two ellipses are identical in form and have an identical orientation (their semimajor axes are parallel). The direction of rotation of the electric vectors is determined by the ratio of the phase shifts 'Y and o. In the given instance, ('Yj = 1) 'Y = -0.

Furthermore, for one and the same observer, the directions of rotation of the electric vector in the incoming and outgoing wave will be opposite. Following the rules established, the observer which the Umov-Poynting vector is pointing at determines the direction of rotation. In the given instance, we are speaking of the polarization ellipses of two waves propagating in opposite directions. Therefore, an observer located at a single point where waves arrive from opposite directions will record opposite signs of rotation of the electric vectors in the plane perpendicular to the Umov-Poynting vector. Reasoning in an analogous fashion, it is possible to show [3], that 'Yj = 0, if: • The polarization ellipse of the field incident on the receiving antenna is analogous in form to the polarization ellipse of the receiving antenna; but • Its semimajor axis is rotated relative to the semimajor axis of the receiving antenna by 90 degrees; • The direction of rotation of the electric vector for the incident field is determined based on the condition 0 = 1t - 'Y. Physically speaking, this means that the orthogonal components of a signal with elliptic polarization arrivill:g at the input to the receiver have opposite phases and identical amplitudes, and their sum is equal to zero. Of practical interest is the determination of the polarization coefficient in the case where the transmitting antenna has elliptic polarization and the receiving antenna (the jamming target) has linear polarization.

In accordance with what has been said, P2 cr = -G(<p 8) s P , ( 4.52) where P 2 is the power scattered by the target; and G( <P, 8) is the gain of an antenna which we could view as the equivalent of the given scattering target. G(<p,8) is defined by the angles <P, and 8, which correspond to the receiving point of the signal reflected. Let us clarify this definition using the example of a flat, ideally conducting plate, located in the Fraunhofer diffraction region, illuminated by a mono static radar. Let us analyze the case where the Umov-Poynting vector of the incident wave p is perpendicular to the illuminated plate, and its characteristic overall measurements a and b are much larger than the wavelength A.

The equivalent antenna area in the conditions analyzed can be assumed equal to its geometric area S. The gain G(~,e) should be determined for the angles ~ = e = 0 (Figure 4.10). By definition, under the conditions being considered, Accordingly, S G(~, e) = G(O, 0) = 4n 'A2 (4.53) (4.54) Expression (4.54) defines the maximum RCS value for a flat, ideally conducting plate. When it is turned in space by angles ~ and e (position s' in Figure 4.10), the RCS in the initial receiving point decreases and becomes equal to (4.55) where F(~, e) is the normalized directional pattern of the plate with respect to field. In the first approximation, an aircraft, as a reflecting object, can be represented as a certain set of reflecting plates, positioned at various angles to the incident plane wave. Depending on the constructional specifics of the aircraft and its relative bearing and orientation relative to the radar, the quantity of reflecting plates, their sizes and orientations, and consequently Figure 4.10 Determining the gain G(ifJ,9) for the angles ifJ = e = o."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"188 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare their ReS, will vary. Due to the sharp change in the ReS of the plate, resulting from the 4th power of the dependency of the ReS on the angles <P and 8, the scattering sources, which are the greatest contributors to the total ReS, are often called \"specular points.\" Experience shows that, for a modern airplane, the number of \"specular points\" is small (about 10). A signal, reflected from an aircraft, is formed as the result of the combining of signals reflected by the totality of the randomly situated specular points. The amplitudes and phases of the signals reflected from them are also random. The circumstances mentioned also dictate the random nature of the changes (fluctuations) in the envelope and phase of the resulting reflected signal, which have to be taken into consideration when generating deception jamming. Accordingly, the ReS of an aircraft is also a random value with an exponential probability density [5, 6]: p(cr) = _1 exp(-~) cr ove cr ove ( 4.56) Here, cr ove is the average ReS of the airplane. In the material that follows, if there is no statement to the contrary, we will take the ReS of an aircraft to be crs = cr aue • The ReS of a battle formation (BF) crBF is taken to be equal to the sum of the ReS of the targets located in the radar resolution element: A1/H' crBF = E cri i=l ( 4.57) where cri is the ReS of an individual target; and Mpv is the number of targets in the resolution element (pulse volume). The Res value of an aircraft depends essentially on the relative bearing with respect to the illuminating radar. It has a lesser value when the aircraft is illuminated from the forward hemisphere. The greatest value is for radars located broadside. Up to this point, we have been speaking of reflection from flat, ideally conducting elements. If the surface of the reflecting element is curved, then a depolarization of the scattered signal occurs. The degree of this depolariza- tion can be determined using of a polarization dispersion matrix [6, 7]. Depolarization can occur for other reasons, too, leading to a change in the direction of current in the scattering element.

Written down in its general form, this equation is rather unwieldy. It is difficult to use it directly to evaluate the electronic environment and determine the information damage caused (to calculate the radar area disabled by active jamming). The solution of these problems can be simplified by reducing the jamming equation to its canonical form. With that end, let us introduce two indicators that reflect the quantitative and qualitative aspects of jamming. The first indicator KREJ is equal to the ratio of the effective radiated power density (ERPD) of the target to that of the jammer and characterizes the quantitative aspect: (4.58) where !:l./s ~ !:l.frec. The second indicator llREJ reflects the qualitative aspect of the process and is defined by the following expression: ( 4.59) Here, Ky is the radar jamming coefficient for a given type of jalnming.

When jamming originates from within battle formations, (4.70) Based on two examples, let us clarify the method of calculating jamming areas using (4.69) and (4.70). First, let us assume that the radar is being attacked with active jamming by jammer JS from within an area located at a distance D j = 64 km (48 dB(m)) from the radar. We determine the reduced ERPD ratio KREJ and the attenuation coefficient Ct using the expressions K REJ = 10 8 m 2 (80 dBm 2 ), Ct = O. We represent the normalized radar antenna pattern in the azimuthal plane with regard to field using the following conditional values. The 3-dB beam width <po.s = 10 degrees, and 10-dB beam width <PO.l = 2 <po.s. The width values of the first, second and other sidelobes are identical and equal to <po.s. The averaged levels of the first, second, third and fourth sidelobes are accordingly equal to -20, -24, -28, -32 dB. An analog of the pattern F(<P) is shown in Figure 2.4. In Table 4.1, we show the results of calculating the detection range Ds( <P j ) of an aircraft battle formation (BF), depending on the width of the sector covered Z<Pj. The value Ds(<Pj) is assumed to be equal to D smin within the limits of the first lobe of the beam. The corresponding jamming area is shown in Figure 4.11. In many respects, it shows in greater detail the generalized jamming area presented in Figure 4.3. In the example being analyzed, the level of the radar antenna sidelobes is quite large.

In the given case, this indicates a requirement to perform calculations using more exact formulas that take into consideration the intrinsic noise of the receiver, which is determined using (4.6). Besides this, it is necessary to keep in mind the line-of-sight range. In the examples analyzed, the level of the radar sidelobes is determined assuming a uniform distribution of the field amplitudes for the antenna aperture and that it is cophasal in nature (Figure 2.4). Such antennas were used in first and second generation radar. At present, to assure information stability in jamming targets, measures have been taken to significantly reduce the signal levels received along the sidelobes. Basically, this is achieved in two ways: through the tapered distribution of field amplitudes in the antenna aperture, and the cancellation of emissions received by the sidelobes. In order to decrease the level of the sidelobes, the field amplitude along the aperture is tapered from the center to the edges. As sidelobes are reduced . the main lobe becomes wider. If it is necessary to hold the value of the 3-dB beam width, then the external dimensions of the antenna have to be increased accordingly. In Tables 4.3 and 4.4, we show the values of the 3- dB antenna beam width (q>o.s), the position of the first zero of the pattern (q>o), the maximum of the first sidelobe (MSL) in dB with respect to the main maximum.

In particular, if D smin = 32 dB(m) (1.6 km), then the range in the direction of the lobe being analyzed will be 53 dB(m) (200 km). The compensation scheme considered here is analog. Practically speaking, it can be implemented in a digital variant. In practice, multi- channel self-balancing cancelers with correlational feedback can be imple- mented based on phased or adaptive phased antenna arrays (PAA or AP AA). Modern multielement P AA (or AP AA) with high resolution can assure an attenuation of the jamming effect not only in the sidelobes, but in the main lobe. This can happen if the entropic nature of the jamming effect in the angular coordinates is not large. In order to exclude or impede the implementation of such a possibility, it is necessary to provide for a sufficiently high level of entropic power for angle noises. The dependency of 'Ilc on the degree of cross-correlation of jamming in the main and cancellation channels indicates a possibility of increasing the effectiveness of jamming through developing suitable Ineans for the decorrelation of jamming in the channels. In conclusion, it should be stressed once again that, in the case that it is necessary to overcome jamming cancellation channels, the number of jammers must exceed the number of cancellation channels by at least one.

We consider them below. The issue of accounting for the absorption of radiation in the troposphere, evaluated using the coefficient ex dB/km, is common for all targets and the calculations associated with them. This issue is treated in detail in specialized literature [1, 2]. An analysis of this literature shows that it is possible to ignore the absorption of radiation in the troposphere in the range of waves A, > 3 cm with paths of limited length (approximately up to 100 km). Cases of significant precipita- tion can pose an exception. For example, when the rain rate is 25 mm/hr at wavelength A = 3 cm, it is ex = 0.2 dB/km, and at wavelength A = 2 cm, it is ex = 0.6 dB/km. According to (4.66), in the first case (A, = 3 cm), Dsmin decreases by a factor of two if L j is no less than 60 km. In the second case (A = 2 cm), a decrease of D smin by a factor of two takes place if L j = 20 km. In the range A < 2 cm, especially for millimeter wavelengths, it is mandatory to account for ex. Particularly, at wavelength A = 0.8 cm, Dsminis decreased by a factor of two if L j = 4 km (ex = 3 dB/km) and jamming is generated from within the area. When jamming originates from within battle forma- tions, L j is only 2 km.

The carrier frequency of the transmitted pulse of duration 't s changes linearly in time from It to 12 (Figure 4.19).

The filter is matched with the pulse spectrum, which allows us to use the scheme for determining the jamming coefficient already con- sidered before. A unit pulse is processed optimally, but the initial phase of the signal from pulse to pulse changes randomly. In view of the large pulsewidth of the signals from a pulse-compression radar with a large time- bandwidth product, the pulse repetition frequency in them is not large. Accordingly, the number of pulses in train (n) is small.

The coherent signals reflected from the target 0 from the output to the receiver, after transformation in the phase detector and amplification, are delivered (in the case of an analog processor) to the scope control grid, performing intensity modulation of the electron stream corresponding to the magnitude of the envelope and the phase of the signals received. The change in brightness on the scope screen is recorded by a photo camera with continuous film transport. This completes the first phase of forming the hologram onboard the airplane. The second phase, in the variant considered, is performed on the ground. It includes the photochemical processing of the film with its radio hologram and the subsequent reproduction of the image by irradiating the film using coherent radiation in the optical range (laser) and the capture of the image in visible light on another photo film. After photochemical processing of the latter, direct decoding of the information received can take place. Instead of optical processing on the ground, digital processing of the radio hologram directly onboard the plane can be and, in practice, is performed. In this case, two quadrature channels are formed with two phase detectors at the receiver output, from the output of which, after analog-digital conversion, the discrete signals arrive at appropriate proces- sors. Digital processing is more complex than optical. Synthesizing of the radar antenna aperture permits us to significantly increase the resolution in one angular coordinate. Synthesizing of the antenna aperture can be considered as a procedure for compressing the signal received according to angle ~, similar to the way that linear frequency modulation permits us to perform signal compression according to distance. The compression coefficient in angle BiP is determined as the ratio of angle ~O.5 to the main lobe width ~SA of a synthesized antenna with aperture L SA : B - ~O.5 iP --- ~SA (4.110) The 3-dB beam width of a synthesized aperture antenna LSA IS determined by the formula: A ~SA =-- 2LsA (4.111 )"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Active Jamming of Radar - The Jamming Equation 211 The reduction of the beam width by a factor of two in a synthetic aperture antenna is caused by the doubled difference in the wave path during the process of beam formation.

The minimal jamming range of a bistatic radar is determined using (4.120), if we put in it Frec(<b j ,8 j ) = 1. Then, according to (4.122) and (4.123), (4.127) An analysis of (4.127) and Figure 4.22 shows that, as a result of the distance between the transmitter and receiver parts of a bistatic radar, its jamming using active jamming from zones can be achieved only from certain directions, allowing for the possibility of observing a number of conditions, directly associated with the patterns on the transmitter and receiver sides. We are speaking of providing for jammer start-up conditions and attaining the required degree of jamming in the receiver. Thus, before making a decision to implement a specific jamming technique for a bistatic radar from within the area, it is necessary to make sure that at all stages of implementing the selected route, the conditions mentioned are fulfilled.

It was noted previously that the indicator for potential"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"220 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare stability of jamming and corresponding devices is the information (entropy) quality coefficient llH. Below, using specific examples, this position is expanded upon and clarified. In conclusion, the question of using the jamming equation for the comprehensive analysis of the radio electronic environment unfolding between the conflicting sides is discussed. 4.5.1 The Definition of the Radar Jamming Coefficient Using Narrowband Screening Jamming with a Limited Spectrum In specific conditions, the limiting of the jamming spectrum leads to the reduction of its entropy power in the phase space of the concealed signal. Accordingly, the quality coefficients llE and llH are reduced and the jamming coefficient is increased. In the problem analyzed below, first the jamming coefficient \"Kt is determined and then the degree to which the entropy quality coefficient llH effects it is established. In the given case, it is not possible in full measure to use the methodology of determining the radar jamming coefficient using jamming of the Gaussian white noise type, based on the likelihood function. The required threshold values of the signal/ jamming ratio are determined directly from a likelihood ratio of type (1.1). In order to determine the ratio indicated, it is necessary to represent the sample function of the jamming in the form of a sum of uncorrelated random values of type (2.21). Such a model for the sample function of a random process is called a canonical expansion. Another name is also widespread - the Karhunen-Loeve expansion. At times people speak of a generalized Fourier series [13, 14]. The practical use of a canonical expansion in jamming is known only for narrowband Gaussian noise with a flat spectrum. In this case the random values Ui (sampling values) are distributed according to a normal law and their variances are the eigenvalues of the singular integral equation (2.32) or (2.33) [15]. The multidimensional probability density P'I (U1 , ... , un) of the sample function of narrowband Gaussian noise of duration T is represented by expression (2.39). Bearing in mind first approximation estimates, we will assume the useful signal to be fully known. The only unknown fact remaining is whether the useful signal S is present or absent in the given sample function. The probability density Pn(UO, ... , U'I' S) of the sample function, containing the useful signal S, can be written by analogy with (2.39) in the following way: i = O,n ( 4.138)"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Active Jamming of Radar - The Jamming Equation 221 The decision as to the presence of a useful signal in the given sample function is taken on the basis of comparing the likelihood ratio: (4.139) with a certain threshold value Ao.

An analysis of calculation results of how coefficients 11E and 11H depend on the values of the ratio ~ (Figure 4.26) confirms the statement made earlier about the information quality indicator for jamming as an indicator of its potential stability to counteractions by the side being jammed. A decrease in the entropy power of the interference in the phase space of the jammed signal lower than the permissible level permits the conflicting side, by making the transition to optimum processing, to reduce jamming to a significant degree. This is illustrated by the following numbers, resulting from Figure 4.26. A reduction of 11H by -8, -9 dB, occurring as a result of expanding the passband of the receiver being jammed L:ifs by a factor of two in comparison to the spectrum width of the jamming !:1jj, leads to an increase of K.i by 16, 17 dB, and accordingly an increase in the ERPD of the jamming station of required by 16, 17 dB, which in a number of cases is problematic. The loss of entropy power as a result of a decrease in jamming spectrum width !:1/i to 0.3 of !:1/s requires an increase in the jammer ERPD to assure the specified degree of jamming at 27, 28 dB, which, practically speaking, in many cases is impossible. What has been discussed gives cause to mention the information (entropy) coefficient 11H in a broader sense than as a jamming quality indicator, and consider it as a jamming system information stability indicator, understanding by this its ability to successfully operate in conditions of information conflict. In particular, the assertion is confirmed that in a number of ·cases the loss of information stability cannot be compensated by an increase in ERPD. For example, in the instance analyzed above, when the jamming spectrum is decreased by a factor of three, its spectral density must increase by approximately 5 dB and, at the same time, the entropy power decreases by 15, 16 dB. The required energy expenditures at this time increase by 27, 28 dB. It is necessary, above all, to increase the entropy power of the jamming in the phase space of the target being jammed, and not just its spectral density."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Active Jamming of Radar - The Jamming Equation 227 The calculations shown for the jamming coefficient K.J using narrow- band noise permit us to determine the optimum jamming spectrum width, corresponding to its minimal power at the input to the receiver in the passband of its linear part, at which the required degree of jamming is achieved. The existence of an extremum is caused by the nature of the change in K.J as the ratio !:1/i /!:1/s changes.

In this case the passband of the target being jammed 4Is should be understood to mean the 3-dB width of the main lobe of the antenna. By analogy to the preceding case of jamming a distance-measuring channel, it is possible to state that sources of angle noise must be distributed in a solid angle exceeding by several times the solid angle corresponding to the main lobe. Only when this condition is satisfied can sufficiently high information (entropy) quality coefficients be assured for angle noises llH(~' 8). Radar jamming of angular coordinates, generated by spot jammers with a high ERPD, but a very smallllH(~' 8), can potentially turn out to be informationally unstable. The side being jammed is presented with the potential possibility of implementing techniques providing for the informa- tion stability of its control system. As a second example of a jamming with a limited information indicator, let us analyze the variant of jamming a radar using jamming formed by broadband frequency modulation of the carrier wave using noise. The effective modulation index is assumed to be quite large. The receiver band /)./S, which is the jamming target, occupies only a relatively small part of the frequency band, corresponding to the effective deviation of the carrier frequency {5j (i.e., (5j > > /)./s). The jamming effect in a receiver takes place when the instantaneous frequency of the jamming is within the limits of the band 4Is (Figure 4.28(a)). As a result, at the output to the receiver a sequence of radio pulses is formed with a random initial phase and a constant amplitude (Figure 4.28(b)). If the average interval between the jamming pules is much less that the IF filter time constant, then, according to the central limit theorem, there occurs a normalization of the jamming sequence when passing - through the inertia narrowband linear system (IF) [17]. The minimal required quantity of summed radio pulses with a constant amplitude and a random initial phase required for normalization can be determined by estimating the degree of proximity of the characteristic functions of a Gaussian random value and the probability density of the sum of random values being analyzed. In the first approximation, five or six pulses are sufficient [18].

A limited degree of randomization in the jamming potentially permits the side being jammed to develop methods of significantly reducing the jamming effect even before it arrives at the victim receiver. One of the variants is a device of the \"Dicke fix\" type [8, 20]. It comprises a broadband amplifier (BA), a limiter (LIM), and a narrowband amplifier (NA). Normally the narrowband amplifier is an IF A. For this reason, after the limiter a mixer (MIX) and a heterodyne (H) are included (Figure 4.29).

The power of the jamming at the output to the IF with a Dicke fix is equal to (4.171) It is obvious that the Dicke fix circuit is effective if the value Qj of is sufficiently large. The example analyzed is yet another confirmation of the thesis stated earlier about the reduction of jamming information stability, if the entropic nature of its parameters and attributes is insufficient. 4.5.2 Definition of the Optimum Limiting Level for Direct Noise Jamming In real jammers, screening direct noise jamming is amplified a number of times, including in power amplifiers, the dynamic range of which is quite limited. In order to provide a maximum entropy power at the output to an amplifier with a fixed limiting level, it is necessary to select an optimum variance value for the jamming at the input to the limiter. The existence of an optimum (with respect to the criterion of maximum entropy) jamming variance value in an amplifier with fixed limiting directly follows from the analysis of probability densities p(lI) of the instantaneous values of the jamming at the output to the limiter shown in Figure 4.30. If the noise variance at the input to the limiter is small (Figure 4.30(a)), then only individual noise bursts significantly exceeding its effective value (0') are limited. The uncertainty of the random process is small, since basic~lly it is concentrated in a comparatively narrow region (0'2 is small). In the case of an excessively large input noise variance, the uncertainty at the output is also small, since the majority of the time the process is concentrated within the bounds of the limitation zone (Figure 4.30(b)). If the input noise variance is . optimum, then the jamming is distributed more evenly over then entire limitation zone (Figure 4.30(c)) and the noise entropy at the output to the limiter is the greatest. The probability density of instantaneous noise values at the output to the symmetric limiter P1 (II) can be written down in the following fashion [19]: ( II) = {P1 (II) + 2P(h)O(1I ± h), -h ~ II ~ h P1 0, II < -h, II > h (4.172)"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"232 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare Figure 4.30 Instantaneous values of the jamming at the output to the limiter: (a) small noise variance; (b) an excessively large input noise variance; (c) the noise variance is optimum. Here, P(h) is the probability that the value u will exceed the limitation level (h or -h). It is equal to the corresponding area S (Figure 4.30); and () (u ± h) is the delta function. The one-dimensional entropy of the random value U t with a probability density ofp(u) (4.172) is determined by combining formulas (3.3) and (3.12) that determine the entropy of discrete and continuous distributions. If, at the input to the limiter, the probability density P1 (u) is normal, then the one- dimensional entropy H1 (u) = H1 ( cr, h) is determined using the following formula: ( 4.173) After transformation, the expression (4.167) is reduced to the following form:"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Active Jamming of Radar - The Jamming Equation 233 (4.174) where the Gaussian probability integral q)o (~) is determined by (3.128).

Let us note that it is possible in principle to provide a higher jamming quality at the output to the limiter if, for a fixed input noise variance, we increase the limitation threshold (Ihl). In particular, if h ~ 1.70', then it is practically speaking possible to assume llH = 1. At the same time, it is necessary to bear in mind that then the energy possibilities of the output jammer amplifier are not completely utilized. For example, if in the case analyzed above (Ihl = 1) we set (J' = 1~7' then the jamming entropy power will be Pi = 0.35 instead of 1.2 for the optimum ratio of 0' and h. In optimum mode, although a certain loss of jamming quality does occur, it is compensated for however by an increase in its power. Apparently, in individual specific instances, other conditional extreme co- relationships between 0' and h can exist. The co-relationships derived above are optimum on the average. 4.5.3 Use of the Jamming Equation for Analysis of the Electronic Environment In an information conflict, each of the sides conducts an analysis of the electronic environment as it develops, including the quantitative and qualitative indicators for jamming targets and jamming systems. Specifi- cally, we are speaking of the indicators of individual devices (the number of jammers, their range and ERPDs, the range and ERPD of the victim radar, etc.). This can lead, in certain cases, to false conclusions. For example,. comparing the ERPDs of jammers without taking into account the ReS of airplanes, covered by jamming, and the ERPDs of jammed radar, it is possible to assume that the side with greater jammer ERPDs, when compared to the corresponding jammer potentials of the enemy, possesses a superiority in an information conflict. However, in actuality, taking into consideration the ReS · of airplanes and the ERPDs of radars, things turn out to be different. The jamming equation, written in canonical form, permits us to perform a comprehensive analysis of the electronic targets of the sides participating in an information conflict. The reduced ratio of ERPDs K REJ' determined for each of the sides in the conflict, can serve as an overall indicator of the capabilities of the sides in a radar information conflict.

The reduced ERPD ratio has a dimensionality of m 2 • According to (4.64), (4.175) that is, the indicator analyzed directly stipulates a minimum radar jamming range when jamming is generated from battle formations. A feature of the indicator K REJ is the striving of each side in the conflict to make it as small as possible for himself, and significantly large for the enemy. The circumstance stated explains the co-relationship (4.175). Let us suppose that in the conflict two sides A and B are participating. Let us assume that side A has assured himself a lessor value for the indicator K REJ than side B; that is, (4.176) This means, in accordance with (4.175), that ( 4.177) that is, the less KREJ (A) is, the less Dsmin (A) is too, and the deeper the airplanes of side A can potentially penetrate the AAD zone. Side B will also reason in a similar manner. In practical operations KREJ can be evaluated in range (m 2 ) and in decibels relative to m 2 , using the value of the conditional minimum jamming .. - 62- range D smin ln km or ln dBm. For example, KREJ = 10 m; KREJ = 60 dBm 2 ; Dsmin = 10 3 m = 1 km; D smin = 30 dBm. Independently of the unit of measure selected for the overall indicator for the capabilities of the sides in a radar conflict, it without doubt influences decisions made by the conflicting sides in a most definitive manner."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"236 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare References [1] Skolnik, M., editor, Spravochnik po radiolokatsii (Radar Handbook).

As a rule, the electromagnetic waves scattered are those emitted by victim antennas. Normally jamming is generated by scatterers such as chaff that is employed on a massive scale. However, as a rule, the chaff cloud does not change the electrical properties of the environment, since the distance between the chaff dipoles in the cloud is many tens or hundreds of times greater than the wavelength. Therefore, the effect of passive jamming is to form a masking back- ground analogous to noise jamming. At the present time passive jamming is generated basically with anti radar chaff, dispersed in large quantities in the atmosphere. Chaff is made from paper, glass fiber, or kapron, covered '\\Tith a conductive layer. For this purpose, it is possible to use metallic foil. The length of the chaff and its thickness are selected to ensure effective scattering of radio waves over the \"Tidest range of frequencies possible. As a rule, its length is approximately equal to half the ,vavelength of the victim radar. Ho,vever, chaff having lengths significantly exceeding the radar 'va,~elength n1ay be used. Chaff is normally assenlbled in packets.

If a fairly large number of packets are launched sequentially, then illuminated corridors of significant length are formed on the PPI. At the present time, chaff is made of dielectrics or foil. The minimum thickness of the metallic covering is determined by the thickness of the working surface layer, formed due to the skin effect. The depth of penetration of current in the conductive layer depends on the frequency of the electromagnetic waves. In the centimeter band the depth of penetration can be very small (d ~ 1 flm). This permits us to make chaff in the form of very thin metalized strips or fibers several tens of microns in diameter. Practically speaking, the diameter used is controlled by the issues of durability and technology of manufacture. The quantity of chaff in a packet, depending on the band, comprises tens of thousands or millions of units. As a result of the noncoherence of the fields dispersed by individual chaff dipoles, the RCS of a cloud consisting of dipoles of identical length will, on the average, be equal to the sum of the RCS of each chaff dipole; that is, N crj = L cri = Ncr t i=t (5.1) where cr j is the average ReS of the chaff cloud; cri = crt is the average ReS of one chaff dipole; and N is the number of chaff dipoles in a packet. The formula (5.1) is valid in the ideal case, when literally all chaff dipoles are used effectively. Practically, due to the clumping (sticking together) of chaff dipoles and their breakage, the ReS of the cloud will be less than crj' determined using (5.1). Normally the RCS of a chaff cloud is calculated using a formula that takes into consideration the actual number of operational chaff dipoles in a packet: (5.2) where 11 is the coefficient of the operational number of chaff dipoles. The magnitude of the RCS of one half-wave chaff dipole (cr1) in the general case depends on its orientation relative to the electrical vector of the incident wave. As a result of atmospheric turbulence and aerodynamic properties, chaff dipoles are positioned in the cloud, as a rule, in a random fashion relative to one another. Moreover, to ensure a uniform distribution"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Passive and Active-Passive Radar Jamming 241 of orientations, an attempt is made in manufacture to shift the center of gravity of each dipole by a random interval from its center. Therefore, the ReS of the entire cloud ((Jj) is determined using the average value of the ReS of a single chaff dipole ((J1), positioned randomly in space. The value of ( (J 1) will be found below. Half-wave chaff is the most effective. 5.1.1 The Radar Cross Section of a Half-Wave Chaff Dipole Randomly Positioned in Space According to definition (4.52) the ReS of a chaff dipole is equal to (5.3) where Sl = F!2/P is the ratio of the power re-radiated by the chaff dipole (P2) to the power density (p), of the plane wave incident on the chaff dipole; and G 1 is the orientation coefficient of the chaff dipole. For a chaff dipole, positioned at an angle e with respect to the electrical vector E of the incident wave (Figure 5.1), the re-radiated power P 2 is equal to (5.4) where P 20 is the power emitted by the chaff dipole in the equatorial plane (when e = 0). z y Figure 5.1 The re-radiated power P2 for a chaff dipole positioned at an angle e with respect to the electrical vector E."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"242 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare As is known [1], the power value P20 can be found using the formula: 1 .2 P 20 = 21 R~ (5.5) where i is the current antinode amplitude; and R~ is the radiation impedance of the chaff dipole. For a half-wave chaff dipole, (5.6) where E is the amplitude of the electrical field of the plane wave received; RE = 73.3 ohm is the radiation impedance of the half-wave chaff dipole; and hd = A/Tt is the effective length of the half-wave chaff dipole.

However, for chaff length values that are multiples of the half- wavelength, its ReS once again increases and can be somewhat greater than that of a half-wave dipole (Figure 5.5). The latter does not mean that chaff, destined for the jamming of stations with longer waves, will also be effective against radar operating on shorter waves. The problem is that the quantity of chaff dipoles in the packets for longer waves decreases, since the weight of the packet is fixed. Accordingly, the ReS of a packet decreases for shorter waves. The qualitative dependency of the ReS of chaff on its relative length is shown in Figure 5.5, where the ratio of the chaff dipole length to half the wavelength is offset along the axis of the abscissas. 5.1.2 The ReS of a Hertzian Dipole The ReS of chaff with a length' that is significantly less than the wavelength A (a Hertzian dipole), is tens of times less than the ReS of half-wave chaff.

The latter requires a knowledge of the dynamics of chaff cloud development after the opening of the packet launched by the jammer. The mass of a chaff dipole and its aerodynamic characteristics ensure free movement under the influence of air currents. Practically speaking, the majority of operating chaff dipoles in the packet wander randomly according to the laws of turbulent diffusion in the atmosphere. Quantitative evalua- tions of the fi~st approximation, permitting the approximate evaluation chaff cloud parameters, can be obtained by considering the simplest problem in the theory of one-dimensional walks [4, 5]. In the case analyzed, the diffusing inertialess dipole is a chaff dipole, performing random walks (fluctuations) under the influence of forces caused by the turbulent diffusion of the atmosphere. It is assumed that every time interval 't, the chaff dipole performs a discrete movement of distance h to the right or left of the axis OX. Movement begins from the origin of the coordinates (OX = 0). The movements are performed according to a random law to the right with probability p, and to the left with probability q. The parameters 't, h, P and q are assumed to be constant during the observation time: p+q=l (5.25) Let us determine the probability that after n steps a the moment of time t = n't the chaff dipole has moved away from the origin of the coordinates by a distance of x. The latter occurs if during time t the chaff dipole moves to the right m times and to the left (n - m) times. Accordingly, x = mh - (n - m)h = (2m - n)h (5.26) The probability sought Pn(m) is determined using the Bernoulli formula [6, 7]: (5.27)"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"250 where Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare , CnI= __ n_. __ n m!{n - m)!

Based on the laws of Markovian processes, we determine the probability P{x, t + 't) that the chaff dipole at the moment of time 1 + 't will be at the point with coordinate x. According to the Markovian Theorem, which in the given case is reduced to the formula for full probability, we obtain P{x,1 + -r) = P(x - h, t)p + (x + h, I)q (5.28) P(O, 0) = 1 P(x,O) = ° Using the equality (5.25), the expression (5.28) can be written In the following way: P(x, t + -r) - P(x, t) = (P(x - h, I) - P(x, t))p + (P(x + h, I) - P{x, t))q (5.29) For sufficiently small 't and h in (5.29), the probability differences are represented in the form of the first terms of the corresponding series: 8P(x, t) P(x, 1 + -r) - P(x, I) = 81 't + O('t) P(x - h, t) - P(x, t) = 8P~:, t) h + ~ lf~~, t) h 2 + O(i) where O('t) and O(h2) are the residuals of the corresponding orders of smallness.

As a result of this, the amplitude of the resulting reflected signal changes randomly in time and, besides, a widening of the frequency spectrum of the total reflected signal occurs. The widening of the spectrum of the total reflected signal takes place as a result of the Doppler components of the spectrum caused by the following reasons: • The diffusion per se of the chaff in the atmosphere; • The diffusion in space under the influence of atmospheric turbulence; • Movement under the influence of wind; • The descent of chaff under the influence of the force of gravity; • Diffusion in spaces under the influence of airplane jet turbulence. Additional reasons for the widening of the spectrum of fluctuations of the reflected signal amplitude are: chaff rotation per se, nonuniformity of the radar antenna radiation pattern, etc. The normalized function of the spectral density for amplitude fluctua- · tion of the reflected signal due to the movement of chaff dipoles, according to experimental research, can be represented in the form of a Gaussian curve [9, 10]: S(F) = exp ( -0.7 (~J 2) (5.47) where F is the frequency; Fo.s is the half-power (-3-dB) spectrum width of the envelope: F _ 4V x o.s-T (5.48)"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Passive and Active-Passive Radar Jamming 257 Vx is the averaged veloc~of chaff dipoles in the direction OX (Figure 5.8); and A radar wavelength; V~ = (V~)a + (V~)b + (V~)c Vx is the velocity component of the chaff dipole along radar axis OX (Figure 5.9); (Vx)a is the velocity component of the descent of chaff dipoles due to their own weight; (Vx)b is the velocity component of chaff dipole movement due to the influence of the wind; (Vx)c is the velocity component of chaff dipoles from movement due to the effect of atmospheric turbulence.

These chaff dipoles form the \"fast\" group. The nature of movement of the \"slow\" and \"fast\" chaff dipoles is shown in Figure 5.11. Experimental data indicates a primarily horizontal distribution [11]. The spectrum component F tI for the spread of descent velocities is maximum when the cloud size is small compared to the sizes of the radar pulse volume.

The value of the component Fa to a great extent depends on the elevation angle of the cloud. For radar, operating with small elevation angles, it can be ignored. The spectrum component Fb for the movement of chaff dipoles due to the influence of the wind is proportional to the spread of wind velocities along the vertical (the wind shear) and grows as the cloud progressively increases in size. The average wind velocity, carrying the cloud as a whole, causes a shift in the spectrum and only an insignificant widening of it. For small clouds, the component F b does not depend on the size of the cloud. This component can reach a significant magnitude when jamming a radar, if the chaff cloud has a large vertical size within the limits of 8 0 . 5 , The component due to atmospheric turbulence practically speaking does not depend either on velocity or on the angular coordinates of the cloud, but is ~etermined basically by the meteorological parameters of the atmosphere. It is possible to assume approximately: (5.49) where V IV is the averaged wind velocity, and not the velocity of the chaff dipoles; and A is the wavelength of the victim radar. The meteorological parameters of the atmosphere exert a significant influence on the spectrum width of reflected signals: • The average wind velocity; • The vertical gradient of the wind velocity (wind shear); • The average temperature of the air layer; • The vertical gradient of temperatures and atmospheric turbulence. These meteorological parameters change with altitude. Therefore, the spectrum width of reflected signals for a given distribution of meteorological parameters depends on the altitude. In Figure 5.12 we show the dependency of the normalized spectral density for fluctuations of signals reflected by a chaff cloud on the product FA (F is the fluctuation frequency in Hertz, and A is the wa velength in centimeters) [10].

Coherent pulse-radars with a low pulse repetition rate are broadband.

Coherent pulse-radars with medium or high pulse repetition rates are narrowband.

The latter provides a basis to call these radars pulse-Doppler radar or guasicontin- Uous-\\vave radar (QCW). By filtering Doppler frequencies of useful signals, the jamming effect generated by chaff is reduced by many tens of dedbels. This, in essence, excludes the possibility of jamming pulse-Doppler radar with passive jamming using traditional methods. Practically speaking, it is possible to jam broadband coherent pulse-radar using passive jamming. The required degree of increase in the volume density of chaff can be determined using a quantitative estimate of the degree of reduction of the jamming effect in the MTI cancellation circuit. In Figure 5.14 we give a simplified schematic for a coherent pulse-radar with a single-delay canceler. Here M is a modulator, forming short pulses for the modulation of the high-frequency generator (transmitter) G and long pulses for enabling the coherent oscillator CH during time T, which is approximately equal to the pulse repetition period.

The next new high-frequency pulse once again performs (for itself) phasing of the coherent oscillator. As a result of the high pulse rate, wide bandwidth and the small time of coherency, this variant of a pulse coherent radar is called a pseudo- or quasi-coherent radar. The reflected (useful) signal and the signal of the coherent oscillator after transformation in mixers MXl and MX2, which are also fed signals from the local oscillator LH, arrive at the intermediate frequency amplifiers IF At and IF A2 and then on to the phase detector PD. From the output of the phase detector, the signals arrive at the canceler circuit including a delay line DL with delay time T and a subtractor (cancellation) circuit. The resulting signal at the output to the ideally operating quasi- coherent radar Uout{t) is equal to zero if the reflecting target is stationary, and unequal to zero if the target is moving with a radial velocity that .does not correspond to the so-called blind speed. The latter is understood to be the target (airplane, helicopter) velocity, at which, during the pulse repetition period T, the target moves in a direction towards the radar equal to half the wavelength of the radar.

This permits, with the exception of certain special cases, when determining IS in the formula (5.86) to orient ourselves towards the averaged value sin 2 ( (OD T /2), equal to 0.5.

The RCS of chaff packets can noticeably differ from the nominal value. The RCS of an airplane is sig- nificantly different depending on the bearings of the radar being jammed and meteorological data is approximate.

One of the basic ways of employing passive jamming is the creation of chaff bands of significant length that exclude the possibility of a radar detecting aircraft (helicopter) battle formations. In order to determine the required quantity of chaff, it is necessary to know the path length that must be covered using passive jamming with the required chaff corridor width according to navigational support conditions, as well as the required number of jammers. We will solve this problem in two stages. In the first stage we determine the width of the concealment area provided by the chaff corridor, located in the range of the jammed radar and protecting the battle formation BF (Figure 5.8).

In the first moments of time, the increase 'JE takes place proportionally to the time to the power 3/2. Subsequently, the effective width grows proportionally to the time.

The use of passive jamming using traditional methods in the interests of jamming pulse-Doppler radar is practically speaking ineffective. Up to the present time, three trends have been established, ensuring the maintenance of a~d, in a number of cases, an increase in the effectiveness of both passive and active jamming. They include: the discrete launching of chaff; the creation of large volume chaff clouds with high ReS density (5\" so as to attenuate the radar radiation power density due to its diffusion in the chaff corridor; and the combining of active and passive jamming. 5.5.2 The Discrete Launching of Chaff Priority jamming targets, in this case, are coherent pulse-radars with MTI cancellation of the jamming signal. The basic idea of the discrete method of launching comes down to ensuring radar jamming conditions using a limited amount of chaff by significantly increasing the density of the chaff dipoles, launched in separate discrete areas in space with simultaneous randomization of the time intervals between launches. A certain reduction in the masking properties of a discrete chaff corridor is compensated by an increase in jammers. The quantity of concurrently launched chaff is selected so as to ensure overcoming the IF A circuit by the jamming signal reflected from the chaff cloud. In the conditions analyzed, the greatest uncertainty (entropy) in the jamming environment occurs when the probability density of time intervals between chaff launches is uniform. The average launch interval Tave in this case is equal to (Figure 5.19) T = Tmax + T min ave 2 (5.118) where T max and T min are the maximum and minimum launch intervals. When the quantity of jammers JS is sufficiently large, discrete launc.hing can turn out to be no less effective than continuous launching and lead to the disruption of centralized control of AAD forces as a result of the. loss of radar tracking for trajectories of both battle formations and individual aircraft."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"282 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare IH IH JS IH Figure 5.19 The chaff launch interval. The required quantity of chaff to be launched concurrently in a single resolution element (pulse volume) of a radar being jammed can be determined from the jamming equation, written in the form of expression (5.53). The radar jamming coefficient with single-delay cancellation depend- ing on the technique implemented for creating discrete chaff corridors is determined using (5.105), if separation of discrete corridors by altitude has not been provided for, or using (5.109), if such separation has been provided for. Certain peculiarities occur in the case of discrete launching of chaff to protect individual aircraft [13, 14]. The basic problem here is to ensure that the chaff cloud launched is formed at a sufficiently small distance from the object being protected. This distance must be commensurable with the resolution element of the jamming target. 5.5.3 Attenuation of Radar Signals in a Chaff Band Let us determine the degree of attenuation of radar signals in a chaff cloud, caused by radiation being scattered by chaff (Figure 5.20). We assume that the radiation scattering by chaff dipoles is isotropic and proportional to its averaged RCS. The fields diffused by the chaff dipoles are noncoherent and the power density of the total diffused field is equal to the sum of the power densities of the individual scatterers.

As an example, let us determine the required cubic density and the chaff corridor length, at which there occurs a reduction by 10 times in the operating range of a 3-cm radar. Accordingly, the degree of attenuation of the power density of the radar signal must be 40 dB. Using (5.122), with consideration to the necessity to double L j , we obtain the equation defining the required value of the product cr\"L j : 40 = 8.6cr\"L j or cr\"L j = 4.6 (5.124) If L j = 10 4 m, then the required specific RCS is cr\" = 4.6 . 10- 4 m 2 /m 3 Such an RCS density in the 3-cm band occurs if the cubic chaff density is three chaff dipoles/m3. This is a quite high concentration that is difficult to attain. To jam a 10-cm band radar to the same degree, a significantly lesser cubic density (by approximately one order of magnitude) is required, but this density is also difficult to achieve. The possibilities of radar power jamming increase when active and passive jamming are combined. 5.6 Active-Passive Jamming The combined use of active and passive jamming in the interests of increasing the effectiveness of radar jamming is possible in different variants [15]. Particularly, passive jamming can be used for the following purposes: • Increasing the effectiveness of active jamming operating directly on the radar; • Deliberate modification of the arrival angle of the jamming by illuminating the chaff cloud;"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Passive and Active-Passive Radar Jamming 285 • Increasing the power ratio of the jamming and useful signal at the input to the receiver being jammed as a result of the placement of chaff corridors of great density in the radar scan area in the range of the active jammer. In principle, other variants of the combined use of active and passive jamming are possible. Let us examine the three variants mentioned in greater depth. In the first case (Figure 5.21) the jamming target is a coherent pulse (pseudo-coherent) radar with MTI. The placement of a passive jamming corridor (P]C) with a comparatively high RCS density (O'v) compels the radar operator to turn on the MTI circuit, which leads to the reduction by 3- 5 dB of the of the radar jamming coefficient using active jamming. The latter occurs as a result of the summing of the variances of the noncorrelated jamming signals and the frequency cancellation of useful signals at the output to' the MTI. In the end, the target detection range of the radar being jammed is reduced by 2-2.5 dB(m) , whereas the energy potential of the jammer remains the same. If, due to the effect of active jamming generated by jammer ] S, the radar detection bound of a battle formation of airplanes BF is D A,l (Figure 5.21) then, after setting up a passive jamming corridor (P]C), the detection bound is reduced to a value of D A,2, less than D A,l by 2-2.5 dB(m). In the second variant, the jamming target is directly acted upon by a jamming signal reflected from a chaff cloud. This significantly attenuates (by tens of dB or more) the active jamming power at the input to the jamming Radar Passive jamming corridor (PJC) Figure 5.21 A coherent pulse (pseudo-coherent) radar with MTI as the jamming target."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"286 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare target. This limits the sphere of use of the given jamming variant, in the main, to continuous and quasi-continuous radiation radar, the useful signal power of which is commensurable with the average power of the jamming signal.

The value of L Js is selected with consideration to the following circumstance. The ratio CIpO/41tLjs can not be smaller than FJ(ib p 9 p ), the level of the sidelobe of the jammer (JSA) antenna pattern in the direction of missile P. The ReS of the chaff cloud CI pO at small distances is not great, and accordingly the value of L Js is also limited. The value of L Js is also limited by the RHH jamming condition, in accordance with which the value of K, determined by the REJ equation (5.125) must be greater than or equal to the jamming coefficient K.i. The latter, in the given instance, can be determined using the relationships (3.83) and (3.84). Let us note that the value L j = 100m corresponds to reduction in K by -40 dB. The presence of limitations on the value of L Js on one side and the existence, when guiding the missile using the proportional navigation method, of a critical distance DMtI', after which the missile is no longer controlled [16] (furthermore, DMtI' » L j ), permits us to write down the following approximate formula for D JM : ( LJs ) D JM = DAM 1 - DAM cos(7t -'I) (5.126) In many cases when performing practical calculations, it is possible to assume D JM = DAM. Then the jamming equation in canonical form, solved relative to the minimal radar jamming distance, is written down in the following manner: (5.127) where (5.128) In the case where the third variant is employed using active-passive jamming, the increase in effectiveness of jamming is achieved because the degree of attenuation of the useful signal is two times greater, since it passes through the chaff cloud twice, compared with a jamming signal that"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"288 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare passes through this same cloud only once (Figure 5.23).

The overall mass of chaff dipoles, required to solve the problem posed is ME = 140 tons. In the case where jamming is generated from within the area, the required amount of chaff is doubled. The reduction of the cloud volume by an order of magnitude, when reducing cr v , permits us to limit ourselves to only 14 tons of chaff. 5.6.1 Quantitative and Qualitative Indicators of the Effectiveness of Passive Jamming The basic effectiveness indicators of passive jamming implemented using chaff are the averaged Res of a unit of mass of chaff dipoles in a single standard bundle (packet), and the width of the frequency band they block out. Besides this, the important indicators should include: • The effective chaff diffusion time; • The average time of effective operation on the jamming target; • The averaged Res for a unit of mass of chaff cr1JJ is determined by the ratio of the ReS of the operating chaff dipoles after packet diffusion cr j to their mass in packaged form mj: cr· 2 cr 1JJ =..L. m / g m· :J (5.129) The required bandwidth of chaff in a single packet is correspondingly achieved by including half-wave chaff dipoles of varied length in it. An example can be the chaff in shell RR-170B/AL for chaff and thermal trap launching device AN / ALE-40, installed on U. S. Airforce tactical aircraft [17, 18]. In each shell there is chaff from glass fiber, covered with aluminum, of six various sizes (0.96, 1.57, 1.78, 2.24, 2.80 and 5.10 cm), which assures the"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"290 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare masking of targets in the band from 2.3 to 18 GHz (wavelengths of jammed radar A = 1.7-13 cm). The dependency of the R CS of the packet analyzed for frequency is shown in Figure 5.24. The average diffusion time depends on the turbulent atmospheric diffusion parameters, as well as the specific launching techniques and devices. A significant number of variants for launching devices and technologies for the manufacture of chaff are known [14, 19]. At the present time, in the first approximation, it is possible to orient ourselves towards an average descent speed of chaff dipoles of 1 mIs, which, in many respects, determines the operating time of a cloud on a radar. The average RCS of operating chaff dipoles 1 m 2 corresponds to their mass 19. Basically, the indicators of active-passive jamming are determined by the capabilities of chaff and its launching devices. Requirements for the antenna pattern of jammers, performing illumination of chaff clouds, should be mentioned separately. The main lobe of the pattern must be quite broad in order to ensure illumination of the cloud, taking into consideration its random deviations from the beam axis. Besides, the level of the sidelobe radiation in the direction of the jamming target must be significantly reduced (Figure 5.22). \" 500 400 300 100 L l\\ J\\ \"- II V V\\ ~ } 'V V - ~ - ~ 200 o 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 f, GHz Figure 5.24 The dependency of the ReS of the packet analyzed for frequency_"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Passive and Active-Passive Radar Jamming 291 References [1] Fel'd, Ya.

Decoy radar targets are used to counteract AAD radar for detection, guidance and target designation (DGTD radar). By simulating real aircraft, they increase the stream density A of targets entering the antiaircraft defense area. Given a constant stream density fl of targets to be serviced, the probability of a target being serviced by the AAD automated control system (ACS) for that area is thus decreased. In particular, when centralized control is disrupted, the service probability P~erv according to (1.65) is equal to 1 P~erv = ex 1+- n 293"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"294 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare where ex = *' and n is the number of fire channels being serviced by the given ACS. False radar targets can be used successfully to protect airplanes and other airforce targets at airports, in particular, by attracting high-precision weapon attacks, without having to use aircraft models. Radar and thermal decoys are used to counteract the operation of the tracking sensors of weapon control systems. When expendable, a decoy should capture the tracking sensor of, for example, the radar or thermal homing head of the missile. The probability of capture is determined by the simulation quality and the probability that the decoy will be recognized. Recently, jammers launched from airplanes and ships are being used as disposable devices. By simulating a jammer, they are able both to capture tracking sensors and to deliberately affect DGTD radar forming a part of AAD ACS. Therefore, the problem is to provide a quality simulation of the basic attributes of the targets being simulated for all cases considered. 6.2 Parameters Simulated by False Radar Targets and Radar Decoys In the given case, we are directly emulating the reflected radar signals from the target being simulated. Accordingly, it is necessary to simulate the characteristics of both the information and attendant parameters of the radar signals (including their statistical characteristics as well). In addition, it may be necessary to emulate the characteristic attributes inherent in the target being simulated (i.e., the turbine effect) [5]. Target simulation on first-generation radar displays was done by deliberate reproduction of the envelope of the reflected pulses. In practice, this was achieved with repeater pulse jammers [6] or through the use of chaff with the same RCS value as the target being simulated. As the radar information stability increased, it became necessary to take into account the fluctuation characteristics of the signal reflected from an airplane, in particular, the probability and spectral densities of the envelope [7]. This required appropriate adjustments to the signals being simulated. In radar trackers, a coherent signal is formed as a collection of reflections from a series of scattering sources. As a result of this, angle noise is produced with specific statistical characteristics [7, 8]. The spectrum of signals reflected from the airplane in the Doppler frequency is typical."},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"False Radar Targets and Decoys 295 A most informative attribute used in radar recognItIon is the polarization scattering matrix [5]. In radar signals reflected from the doubly curved surface segments of an airplane, depolarization of the electrical vector occurs due to the change in direction of electrical current when passing along the curved surface. The degree of depolarization can vary depending on the arrival angle of the wave and the radius of curvature of the surface. Quantitatively, polarization characteristics are represented in the form of appropriate scattering matrices for the airplane (missile, helicopter) received for various aspect angles [5, 7, 9, 10]. Other polarization characteristics can also be determined, in particular, the parameters of the polarization ellipse [10]. The elements of the polarization scattering matrix are complex reflection coefficients that occur when an aircraft (or other target) is illuminated by a plane wave. Whereas plane wave polarization is determined by two orthogonal electrical vectors (i.e., E.p and Ee), that form the polarization basis in a spherical system of coordinates, the polarization scattering matrix consists of four complex reflection coefficients S, defined for the orthogonal polarization components of the incident wave Er and the reflected wave E r In the general case, the orthogonal polarization components of the reflected plane wave E,r.p and Ese are expressed using the orthogonal components of the incident wave Er.p and Ere in the following linear combinations: E~ = S.pq;Er.p + Seq;ErS Ese = Sq;eEr.p + SeeEre (6.1 ) The indices ~ and e determine the pair of orthogonal polarization components corresponding to each of the reflection coefficients. Each of them in turn is determined by the modulus and phase of the reflection coefficient (.JCJ,\\II), together with the required indices. The polarization diffusion matrix S in the given case is defined by the following expression: S= vCJ.p.pdW~~ VCJe.pdwe~ vCJipee!'Vile vCJeedwee (6.2) Here, CJip.p is the ReS of the target.

The meanings of the other reflection coefficients with various combi- nations of the indices <I> and e are analogous. Using matrix (6.2), the linear form (6.1) can be expressed in the following way: (6.3) The polarization scattering matrix of a false radar target or decoy must be determined in accordance with results of processing statistical measurement data for the scattering matrices of quite a large group of simulated aircraft. The measurements must be made in various frequency bands corresponding to the victim AAD radars, and for various bearing angles. Along with the simulation of characteristic parameters of reflected radar signals, it is necessary to take into consideration changes in the signal generated by a given target. For example, the turbine effect [5], produces amplitude and frequency modulation in signals reflected from airplanes with turbojet engines. Other effects also occur. These phenomena introduce significant difficulties in developing false radar targets and radar decoys that permit aircraft to overcome antiaircraft defense. In practice, the problem can be solved if the jamming energy is sufficient to provide simulation. This is achieved if, as a false target, we use an aircraft with an expendable active jammer operating on a radar station of the detection, guidance and target designation type. An analogous situation occurs when we launch expendable jammers and thermal decoys to protect individual aircraft. The task becomes simpler when we deliberately simulate aircraft as false targets at an airport or other airbase. In this case, problems associated with motion are removed and quality results may be achieved by simulating only key attributes. This is determined for each case according to the radio environment and the problems to be solved. As a rule, it is necessary to assure a correspondence between the statistical RCS characteristics of the simulator and the averaged RCS of the simulated target. An indicator of the simulation quality for statistical characteristics is the difference in entropies of the probability distributions determined in the sample functions of random processes and representing the changes over time of parameters in the real and false targets (cf. p. 3.2)."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"Folse Radar Targets olld DecO)'s 297 6.3 Methods of Increasing the Radar Cross Sections of False Targets and Decoys 6.3.1 Repeaters The implementation of repeaters does not present any real problems. In Figure 6.1 we show the block diagram of a simple repeater. The signals from the victim radar are received by antenna A 1 , amplified by the preamplifier P A and fed to the final power amplifier FA. The signals are modulated here using noise voltage (current) generated by modulator M, ensuring a quality simulation. After amplification in the final amplifier FA, the signal is emitted by antenna A 2 • Normally traveling-wave tubes are used as amplifiers with a broad pass band and a high gain. Taking into account the isolation being implemented, let us determine the gain of a repeater that can provide the required jamming signal power at the input to a given radar (Figure 6.2).

The ReS of any body for the given direction is determined using the well-known formula: (6.11 ) where S2 = ;. is the ratio of the power (P2) reflected by the body to the power density (p) of the electromagnetic wave incident on the reflector; and G is the gain of the reflector in the given direction (in the direction towards the observation point).

In Figure 6.3 we show the reflection pattern of a metallic plate, the dimensions of which are much greater than the wavelength. Due to the very sharp reflection pattern, a metallic plate is not suitable to increase the ReS of aircraft.

So-called corner reflectors of various types, reflectors in the form of Luneburg lenses and Van Atta arrays to a certain degree meet these requirements. A corner reflector is a rigid structure consisting most often of three mutually perpendicular plates. Depending on the form of the plates, we distinguish (a) triangular, (b) rectangular and (c) round corner reflectors (Figure 6.4). Their maximal RCSs are equal to 4 4 a ( triangular) a~ = \"3 1t A,2 4 a (square) aD = 121t A,2 4 a a o = 21t A,2 (round) Here, a is the rib length of the reflector.

For example, the corner reflector shown in Figure 6.5 generates reflection practically in all directions. The value of the maximum RCS for corner reflectors depends on the precision with which right angles between the plates of the reflector are sustained. A failure to sustain the precision of the angle by only 1 0 leads to a reduction in the maximum RCS value of a corner reflector by 2-5 times. Radio countermeasures using corner reflectors against a radar having an antenna with circular polarization may be ineffective. This is explained by the fact that, from the conducting plates of the corner reflector, the ray is reflected an uneven number of times, as a result of which the direction of rotation of the electrical field vector of the reflected signal is reversed (Figure 6.6(a)). The change in polarization of the reflected waves occurring in corner reflectors can be eliminated if one of its plates is covered with a dielectric layer (Figure 6.6(b)) [6]. This issue is discussed in more detail below. One of the significant drawbacks of corner reflectors is the small width of the reflection pattern at the half-power level. Reflectors implemented with Luneburg lenses have a quite a broad reflection pattern. A Luneburg lens is a dielectric sphere. The index of refraction of the dielectric (n) in an ideal Luneburg lens depends only on the ratio of the radius within the lens (r) to its external radius (R): ( 6.17) In Figure 6.7(a) we show the ray trajectories in a Luneburg lens.

As a result, all rays are focused at point ° on the farther side of the sphere, covered with a metallic film. The point 0, which is a source of secondary electromagnetic waves, creates an in-phase field distribution at the output of the lens, so that the maximum of the reflection pattern corresponds to the arrival direction of the incident wave. The maximum ReS of a Luneburg lens can be found by substituting s = nR2 in (6.13): ( 6.18) The width of the reflection pattern of a Luneburg lens depends on the dimensions of the reflecting (metallic) surface of the sphere. Thus, for a"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"304 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare reflecting surface with a dimension of one quarter the surface of the sphere, the width of the reflection pattern at the half-power level is approximately 90 0 (Figure 6.7(b)). In Figure 6.8, we show the reflection pattern of a Luneburg lens with a 140-degree reflector [6]. The reflection sector of this lens is approximately equal to 140 0 • A Luneburg lens does not provide for circular reflection. The latter can be achieved on the basis of this same lens if part of its sphere is encircled by a metallic ring [11].

The position of the metallic ring determines the direction of maximum reflection. Thus, for a ring around the equator, the maximum is located in the equatorial plane (Figure 6.9(a)). If, however, the ring is shifted, the reflection pattern lobe deviates from the equatorial plane (Figure 6.9(b)). The maximum ReS value is determined using the formula: (1tR2 - 2RL)2 cr k = 41t II} ( 6.19) where R is the radius of the sphere; and L is the width of the metallic ring. A lens in the form of a dielectric sphere with a metallic ring is somewhat less effective than the Luneburg lens with a reflector considered before. A comparison of (6.18) and (6.19) yields 11 = 0' k = (1 _ 2L) 2 0', 1tR For example, if L/R = 0.2, then 11 ~ 0.9. Accordingly, the reduction in the ReS 0' k in comparison with an ordinary lens is insignificant. An increase in the width of the metallic ring leads to the widening of the reflection pattern, but the ReS of the lens is reduced. This contradiction is solved well in a Luneburg lens with a ring in the form of an array of parallel wires wound at an angle of 45° (Figures 6.10 and 6.11). Such a lens is sometimes called a helisphere. An electromagnetic wave with a linear polarization incident on the helisphere at an angle of 45° passes through the frontal part of the ring and is Wire ring Figure 6.10 An increase in the width of the metallic ring."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"306 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare Orthogonal wire rings Figure 6.11 A Luneburg lens with a ring in the form of an array of parallel wires wound at an angle. reflected off the opposite part of the ring. For other polarizations, (vertical, horizontal, circular), there are polarization losses, the maximum of which (when passing through twice) is 6 dB. To obtain an isotropic pattern, a helisphere with two orthogonal wire arrays is used. By selecting the width (and sometimes the configuration) of the rings, it is possible to obtain a comparatively small heterogeneity of the reflection pattern. In principle, it is possible to create an ideal lens without metallic rings with isotropic reflection (an Eaton-Lipman lens). For this, the coefficient of the dielectric filler must change according to the law: n= J2~ 1 where r is the radius within the sphere. The ray trajectory in a lens with circular reflection is portrayed in Figure 6.12. Dielectric helispher~c lenses are quite heavy. They are difficult to implement due to the necessity of inserting a dielectric with a very large index of refraction into the central part (r ~ 0). Hollow helispheric reflectors have significantly less weight (Figure 6.13(a)). The reflective ring is made from metal and comprises a spherical section. The wire array and the metallic ring are positioned orthogonally. The ReS of such a reflector is 10 dB less than that of an ideal Luneburg lens.

A Van Atta array is, in essence, an antenna array made from a large number of dipoles, spirals and other reflectors (Figure 6.15). The dipoles are located at an equal distance from the axis of symmetry and are connected in pairs using coaxial cables of identical length. An electromagnetic wave received by dipole 1 is reradiated by dipole 6. In turn, dipole 1 reradiates the wave received by dipole 6. The electrical lengths of the antenna feeder system 1-6, as well as of the other dipoles connected in pairs, are identical. Signals, received and reradiated by the dipoles, traverse an identical path. Therefore, the direction of the maximum of the reradiation pattern corresponds to the direction of arrival of the incident wave. The arrays are designed to reflect waves with any polarization. For this purpose, the dipoles are placed in a metallic screen at various angles (as a rule, each pair forms a 90° angle with the neighboring one). The ReS of the array formed from n half-wave dipoles located at a distance of'A/2 from one another and at a distance of'A/4 from the reflecting screen, can be found using formula [12]: where e is the incidence angle; and S is the array aperture area."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"False Radar Targets and Decoys 309 Feeder lines Figura 6.15 A Van Atta array. Bearing in mind that S ~ n'A2/4, we obtain the expression' for the maximum ReS of a Van Atta array: (J' \"-J 1t 2'\\ 2 \"-J -n A 4 The re-radiated signal may be amplitude modulated. For this purpose, phase shifters are included in the feeder lines connecting the radiators. By making an appropriate change in phase shift, it is possible to obtain the necessary amplitude modulation law in the reradiated signal. Using phase shifters and other components, it is possible to achieve the required radiation parameter randomization in the interests of providing the needed simulation quality. A Van Atta array can also be made in an active variant (a repeater), where the signal received is amplified in each channel and is reradiated (Figure 6.16). The basic difficulty in making this type of reradiator is isolating the receiving and transmitting sections. The drawback of a Van Atta array is its relatively · narrow bandwidth. In conclusion we would note that the various reflectors considered in this paragraph do not exhaust the manifold devices and techniques for increasing the ReS of false targets. For example, research is being conducted into the possibility of increasing aircraft ReS using space ionization around the false target, in particular, the ionization of the jet engine stream of the decoy missile by adding (injecting) easily ionized elements into the fuel [6]."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"310 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare Receiver reradiators Transmitter reradiators ~ T T-----T T Figure 6.16 A Van Atta array in an active variant (a repeater). In principle, it is also possible to achieve the needed simulation quality in an analogous manner by using angle reflectors and Luneburg lenses. For this purpose, it is necessary to form the reflected signal using a set of reflectors, separated in space, that form a single system, including com- ponents in its high frequency section to provide an ability to modulate and randomize the deception signal. The reflected signal must also ensure that its scattering polarization matrix is identical to the corresponding matrix of the useful signal. In this area, controlled impedance coverings and structures that have appeared in radar technology recently and are associated with the problem of controlling the diffusion of electromagnetic waves, seem very promising [13]. Bearing in mind the assurance of information stability in deception systems in the complex conditions of information conflict, it is convenient to increase their intellectual potential by including knowledge bases containing appropriate adaptation proce- dures, created on the basis of generalized expert evaluations that have been defined using a large number of typical cases [14], into the automated deception jamming control system. 6.4 Thermal Decoys Thermal decoys are the most common expendable EW device. They are widely used not only by military, but also by civil aviation flying over a dangerous area. The operations targets of thermal decoys (TD) are thermal (infrared, IR) homing heads (THH) of \"air-to-air\" and \"surface-to-air\" class missiles that perform passive homing on aircraft protected by TD. The source of radiant energy, carrying information about the angular"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"False Radar Targets and Decoys 311 coordinates of the aircraft, is thermal (IR) radiation. The basic irradiators of a turbojet airplane at subsonic speeds are the turbojet engine (T ]E) and the jet stream of heated gasses. The most intensive radiation of molecules of a hot gas stream at all temperatures occurs at wavelengths 2.7 and 4.3 Ilm [15]. The maximum radiation Amax = 2.7 Ilm, is caused by the overall radiation of water vapor and carbon dioxide gas CO 2 . Radiation at a wavelength Amax = 4.3 Ilm is caused by CO 2 • During intercept guidance of a missile with a THH to supersonic aircraft, the source of radiant energy is their outer covering, heated by the opposing air stream. Thermal decoys are cartridges (shells), filled with a pyrotechnic compound with a quite high combustion temperature, that are launched (shot) from aircraft in such a fashion that their radiation effects the jamming target. The average combustion time of a TD is up to 6 sec in the infrared range 2-5 Ilm [1-3]. The energy of the radiant stream of the thermal decoy within the limits of field of sight (the entrance pupil) of the THH must be greater than the radiant stream energy emitted by the aircraft and assure the capture of the missile with a THH at itself. The quantitative evaluation of capture conditions can be determined on the basis of the optoelectronic jamming equation (OE]), which an analog of the electronic jamming equation. Before writing the 0 E] equation, we will mention certain definitions and terms commonly used in optoelectronic technology (when using energy values and units). Initial in the given case is the radiant stream power ~ e inp, incumbent on the input optics (input pupil) of the radiation receiver of the THH. Specifically the power of the input radiation stream determines t~e value of the output signal of an optoelectronic receiver [15, 16]. For the THH to be captured by the TD, the following inequality must be fulfilled: ~e inp,tt ~ Ky~e inp,ac (6.20) where ~e inp,tt and ~e inp,ac are the radiant stream powers from the TD and the aircraft at the input to the pupil of the optoelectronic receiver of the THH; Ky is the THH jamming coefficient, determining the degree by which the radiant stream power of ~ e inp, It must exceed ~ e inp, ac for there to be a high probability of capture. It is determined experimentally or using modeling. The order of the value Ky can be determined 'from expressions (3.83) and (3.84). In the case examined, they are expressed in the following way:"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"312 \\vhen.: Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare K ~8 = ~f.-) -- I (, I + 1\\ q> K = f mp.1I <I>r mp.lJ( (().21 ) Presumably K J = 3-4. This value corresponds to a capture probability no less than 0.6-0.7, if the radiation of the TO affects the input pupil of the optoelectronic receiver. The relationship (6.20) can be considered to be the optoelectronic jamming equation OE]. Based on the OE] equation (6.20), let us determine the required radiation power density It' /I for a thermal decoy for a given radiation power density of a turbojet engine or other source of radiation It' oc· The radiation power density Ie determines the radiant stream radiated by the source in the given direction.

The diffusion contour, allowing for the effect of reflected radiant streams, is indicated using a dotted line [15]. In the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the value Me defines the integral surface density of radiation, encompassing the entire spectrum range of emissions. The radiation spectral density MeA is determined using Planck's law [15, 16]: ( 6.26) where C 1 = 21Chl; C 2 = ch/k; c is the speed of light in a vacuum (m/s); k is Boltzmann's constant (k = 1.38 .10- 2 J/K); h is Planck's constant (the quantum constant) (h = 6.63 . 10- 24 J.S.); and C 1 = 4.99 . 10- 24 J.m; C 2 = 1.44.10- 2 mK. ~ , , , ' .... _-- (a) 4000 Ie' WtlS, 4000 Ie' WtlS, (b) Figure 6.17 The radiation contours of an American fighter F-l04 with a T JE: (a) vertical; (b) horizontal."},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"314 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare A graph of the radiation spectral density for an ideal irradiator (an absolutely black body) for three temperature values is given in Figure 6.18 [16].

The combustion tempera- ture of a thermal decoy Tit must be in the range of (6.30) Assuming the radiating surfaces of the TD and the engine to be round, and the jamming coefficient to be K.i = 2, let us write down (6.30) in the following form: T ~ T 4 1.4 den II r en d tt (6.31 ) If we assume diameters of T JE output orifices of the order of ones of meters and launching device diameters in tactical aircraft of the order of hundredths of a meter, then, with the help of Wien's law and the formula \"'max = 2900/T tt resulting from it, it is possible to determine that the maximum TD radiation must be in the ultraviolet range. The circumstance mentioned gives cause to assert that thermal decoys with a small radiation area (small diameter) have a spectrum that differs significantly from that of a T JE, which reduces their information stability, since techniques can potentially be proposed to reduce the degree to which their radiation effects THH [17]. Better from the point of view of providing information stability are TD with a large diameter and a lower radiating surface temperature. An increase in diameter causes problems of a different nature. Certain of them are considered below in conjunction with the particulars of the kinematics and dynamics of decoys launched from an airplane. To a great extent, the information stability of THH with respect to thermal decoys is attained by increasing the resolution of thermal homing heads. In these conditions, it is necessary to assure the burning TD reaches its nominal temperature in quite a short period of time."},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"316 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare 6.5 The Use of Towed and Launched Decoys 6.5.1 Towed Decoys Towed d~coys can be used to thwart a missile or fighter attack during the last phase of guidance (homing). These decoys are towed by a bomber airplane on a thin cable, the length of which can reach several kilometers. When stowed, the decoy is located in a special compartment. At the moment the bomber starts pene~rating the most dangerous AAD areas, the decoy is released with the help of a starting device. The first experience of using towed decoys goes back to the Second World War, when English and American airforces used towed metallic nets as false targets to reduce the AAD effectiveness of the Germans. These nets, creating powerful reflected signals, captured the gun laying stations A towed decoy is equipped with amplifying repeaters and passive reflectors that increase the value of its ReS to that of the carrier airplane. When necessary, equipment for infrared jamming can be installed in the decoy, as well as sources for its radiation. Towed decoys can be employed to counteract guidance and homing circuits. Their effectiveness is high if, at the initial moment of missile (or fighter) guidance, the protected airplane and the decoy are represented as a single target (i.e., they are not resolved into angles, ranges and Doppler frequencies). The use of towed decoys has a number of specifics. The distance of the towed decoy from the airplane basically is determined by the angle and velocity resolution of the system being jammed. The condition where the airplane and the decoy are not resolved in angle is expressed in the form: ( 6.32) where ~el1l is the resolution of the victim radar in angle; D is the distance to the victim radar; and q is the decoy aspect ratio. The condition where the airplane and the decoy are not resolved in Doppler frequency is determined by the passband width of the \"velocity gate\" ~F and the difference in Doppler frequencies of the decoy and the airplane !!if: Here,"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"False Radar Targets and Decoys 317 ( 6.33) V a1l \" Vir are accordingly the closing velocities of the attacking missile and the protected airplane and decoy (Figure 6.19).

In the same diagram, we show the area where the decoy is eclipsed by the plane III. The airplane eclipses the decoy if the attacking missile is inside the cone, the angle at the apex of which is equal to . k'R a = arc slnT where R is the kill radius of the missile; and k' is the safety factor. The value of area III is quite significant for attacks from the front hemisphere. 6.5.2 Expendable Decoys Expendable decoys serve to protect an airplane from an attacking missile (fighter). These decoys have no motors and are active and passive reflectors with a larger RCS than the target airplane they are protecting. A corner reflector, a chaff packet or a burning pyrotechnic compound can serve as a decoy. The expendable decoy can be locked onto by the tracking system of the missile (fighter), if the following conditions are met: • The RCS of the decoy is greater than that of the protected airplane; • The operations time of the false target signal is greater than or equal to the time constant of the tracking system for angle, velocity and distance. The second condition imposes quite rigid requirements on the design of expendable decoys. For pulse systems, the length of time that signals from the decoy operate on the homing system is determined by the time the decoy spends in the pulse volume and, for continuous radar, by the time the radial component of the relative velocity of the decoy spends within the limits of the pass band of the tr~cking system for velocity, as well as by the time the decoy spends within the antenna radiation pattern of the radar being jammed. For a thermal decoy, this is the time spent within the limits of the field of sight of the IR radiation receiver. Let us determine conditions for a pulse automatic target tracking radar to lock onto a expendable decoy. In order to determine the time the decoy and target remain in the same pulse volume, it is necessary to calculate the trajectory of the false target launched from the airplane when it is in free fall. As is known from a course"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"False Radar Targets and Decoys 319 Figure 6.21 The approximate trajectories of falling decoys. in ballistics, the free-fall trajectory is determined by the characteristic time 8 and the height and velocity the airplane is flying at when the decoy is launched. 1 In Figure 6.21 we show the approximate trajectories of falling decoys in a mobile system of coordinates, associated with the bomber for various values of the characteristic fall time 8 1 > 6 2 > 8 3 , As can be seen from the diagram, the characteristic fall time has a significant influence on the time the airplane and decoy spend in the pulse volume. When 6 = 6 2 , the time the decoy spends in the volume of a sphere with R = const is greater than when 6 = 6 1 , The characteristic fall time of a decoy is determined by the formula, well known in ballistics [18]: (6.34) where i~ C x 10 3 is the ballistics coefficient; i is the decoy shape coefficient; dis 1. The characteristic fall time is the time for a body to fall from a height of 2000m in standard atmospheric conditions."},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"320 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare the decoy diameter; G is the mass of the decoy; and ex is the aerodynamic coefficient. From (6.34) and Figure 6.21, it follows that, in order to increase the time a decoy spends in the pulse volume, it is necessary to decrease its characteristic fall time 8. Since the external dimensions of a decoy are determined by the dimensions of the reflectors installed on it, a decrease in the characteristic time 8 is achieved by increasing the mass of the decoys (see (6.34)). Let us determine, for example, the mass of a decoy comprising a Luneburg lens with a diameter d = 0.5m (0' ~ 190 m 2 , 'A, = 5 cm). Let us assume i = 8, ex = 0.2. Then the required mass of expendable decoys is approximately G = 500 kg if 8 = 21 sec G = 70 kg if 8 = 26 sec The example given shows that expendable decoys must have a significant mass. In order to increase the time an expendable decoy spends (when its mass is small) in a quite close vicinity to the target, it is necessary to specify its initial velocity in the direction of motion of the aircraft (i.e., to equip the decoy with a start-up motor). Accordingly, its trajectories in a mobile system of coordinates, linked with the bomber, change abruptly. In Figure 6.22 we show the trajectory of a decoy equipped with a start-up motor. Here we also mark, using a dotted line, the trajectory of a decoy without a motor. To this point in time \\ve have considered that there are no differences in the techniques of jamming guidance and homing circuits using decoys. However, the use of decoys for the guidance circuits of a pulse-type tracking system has important specifics. Basically, these specifics relate to the maximum separation velocity of the decoy from the protected airplane, which in the latter case is determined by the discrete nature in which information about target coordinates is received. In the simplest pulse-type guidance circuit, data about target coordi- nates arrives with a certain repetition factor, the value of which depends on the radar antenna rotation velocity (normally a 360 0 scanning radar). The period for receipt of information in modern systems is evaluated of the order of several seconds. Releasing the decoy at the moment the protected airplane is irradiated, it is necessary to fulfill conditions (the initial velocity, the average velocity over the radar scan period): the released decoy should not, within one scan"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"False Radar Targets and Decoys 321 Without start-up motor ~c ~ .... ....

The absolute value of the initial velocity in the given case is not of any special consequence. It is important that the average velocity during the scan period of the victim radar be less than a certain value. 6.6 Selecting Decoy Launch Time Depending on the electronic environment taking shape, the launching of decoys is performed either continuously with a certain fixed average rate, or a one-time launch is done in accordance with information arriving from devices indicating the launch or the danger of launch of enemy missiles, or the use of other weapons against the aircraft protected. In the first case, we mentioned, above all, the launch of thermal decoys in the high-threat area where an aircraft may be hit by mobile and other antiaircraft and missile complexes with thermal homing heads. The release rate is selected according to the average fire cycle length of the antiaircraft and missile complex. In the second case, the decoy, including thermal 0:[ expendable jammers, is launched according to information received from onboard instruments"},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"322 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare warning the crew of the threat of launch or the launch of weapons by the enemy attacking. Information about the threat to the aircraft is normally formed on the basis of observing changes in the signal parameters of the enemy's radio electronic systems. Normally the intensity of the signal and the character of its change, and the arrival angle of radiation (bearing, carrier frequency, duration and pulse repetition frequency) are recorded. Other signal para- meters, including their statistical characteristics, can be observed and measured. Measurement (observation) results are compared to correspond- ing parameter values present a priori in the computer database of the onboard control and information support system. According to the comparison results, a decision is made about the launch of a decoy or an expendable jammer. Automated decision making circuits of this type have a limited level of information stability. They are based on relatively simple variants of the radio electronic environment and are vulnerable with respect to the simplest enemy countermeasures (i.e., simulated missile launches resulting in pre- mature decoy ejection). Information stability can be increased by introducing elements of expert evaluation into the automated control system (i.e., by going to intelligent automated control systems). In separate works, in the analogous case, authors refer to automated control systems with artificial intelligence [19]. Practically speaking, intelligent systems are implemented by creating knowledge (procedure) bases in onboard computers. The process of creating the latter is quite onerous [14, 20]. It includes the generalization of results of simulation modeling of typical combat situations, including the results of experimental exercises. As variants for the definition of procedures, associated with selecting the moment for launching expendable electronic jamming (DE]) devices, it is possible to use the simplest models of behavioral dynamics of sides in conflict. One of these examples is the episode when there is one decoy on the aircraft being attacked and the attacker has one missile. The enemy attacking determines the optimum moment to launch the missile, and the side being attacked - the optimum moment to release the decoy. The effectiveness indicator is the probability that the aircraft will be hit or the mathematical expectation of losses. The problem can be reduced to a zero-sum matrix game, if the dynamics of the conflict taking place during the time T is considered for discrete moments of time !::11. Let us designate by Ai(i = 1, m) and BjU = 1, m) the pure strategies of the attacking and attacked sides. Strategy Ai means that the side attacked launches a decoy at the moment of time Ii = i!::1l. Strategy B j"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"False Radar Targets and Decoys 323 correspondingly means that a missile is launched at the moment of time 'i = jf::1t. The cost function in the given case is the probability P ij that one missile will hit the aircraft being attacked. According to what has been mentioned, the matrix game being considered can be expressed in the following manner: i -1 m· J' = 1 m - \" , (6.35) where T = m f::1t is the time of conflict. Here, Pij is the probability the aircraft will be hit by the missile launched by the enemy at the moment of time 'i = jf::1t if the side attacked releases its decoy at moment of time ti = if::1t: ( 6.36) where Prt(i,j) is the probability the missile will be captured by the decoy (of the expendable jammer) in the case being analyzed; Ph it is the probability the aircraft will be hit by one missile in standard conditions. The variant represented by matrix (6.35) is the simplest and the optimum values ti and 'i can be determined for one episode. Practically speaking, an optimum solution, even for the simplest situation, can be obtained as a result of analyzing a number of variants of the conflict. In the given case, this means attacking at various course angles and with various available intervals of time T. In the general case, it should be borne in mind that each of the sides in the conflict plans and conducts measures to reduce the information stability of the opposing side. The number of missiles and decoys cat?- vary. This number depends on the parameters of the battle formation. There can also be other specifics for combat use. All of this stipulates the necessity of developing mathematical models to perform modeling of a broad range of variants and conditions of military operations. The knowledge (procedure) base comprises generalized evaluations and recommendations, obtained by experts on the basis of both logical study of the modeling results and the generalizing of experimental and command headquarters exercises.

Another solution is to change the electrical properties of the medium to increase the attenuation coefficient in the atmosphere. The quantitative evaluations follow from the equations for radar range and radio and optoelectronic jamming. The radar detection range (Ds) of an aircraft with an\" ReS of cr s according to (4.9) is given by the expression: D = Acrl/410-o.0ScxLj s s (7.1) where P n G n A, and P ree min are parameters of the radar: the ERP, the wavelength, 327"},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"328 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare and the minimum required power of a reflected signal detected by the receiver; ex is the attenuation coefficient in the atmosphere; and L j is the length of the path with increased absorption. As follows from (7.1), the detection range Ds is decreased only slowly with a reduction in (1s. For example, if an aircraft with an ReS of (1s = 10 m 2 (10 dBm 2 ) is detected by a certain radar at a maximum range of Dsmax = 400 km (56 dB(m)), then one having an ReS of (1s = 1 m 2 (0 dBm2), is detected by the same radar at a distance of 220 km (53.5 dB(m)). The detection of the aircraft at a range of 220 km is sufficient for AAD to solve the problem of its destruction. A reduction in ReS by 30 dB, which gives a value of (1 = 0.01 m 2 (-20 dBm2), decreases the detection range to Ds = 70 km. A final reduction in detection to a value of Ds = 40 km (-46 dB(m)) requires a decrease in ReS by 40 dB, which corresponds to a value of (1s = 0.001 m 2 (-30 dBm 2 ). A reduction of the ReS of an aircraft with an (1s = 10 m 2 by 10 dB is achievable in practice while retaining, basically, the classical aerodynamic design of an aircraft. The reduction of ReS to lower values 0.1-0.001 m 2 requires the use of different principles - the newest technologies of design and development of aircraft. At the same time, the required ERP of an onboard jammer on the aircraft decreases proportionally to (11\" This is confirmed by the jamming equation (4.62), defining the minimum radar detection range of an aircraft (Dsmin) protecting itself using active jamming: D . r;;;-K 10-o.os cxL . smin = V.L\\..REJ '.I (7.2) where (7.3) PjG j , fl./; are the ERP and spectrum width of the jammer; K.i is the jamming coefficient; and 'Yj is the polarization coefficient. Here we understand target detection to mean the determination of its coordinates, including the distance to the target. From (7.2) and (7.3) it follows that the required jammer ERP for a fixed Dsmin changes proportionally to the ReS of the aircraft being protected (1s. If, for example, the protection of the aircraft with (1s = 10 m 2 is provided by a jammer with an ERP of PjG j = SOW, then for a reduction in ReS to (1s = 1 m 2 it is sufficient to have a power of P j = lW, if G j = 5. In an analogous manner, the expenditure rates for onboard passive and active- passive jamming devices are decreased."},{"pageNumber":349,"pageContent":"Methods of Reducing Aircraft DetectabililJ' 329 Apparently, with respect to cost/effectiveness, for a given aircraft there exists an optimum relationship between the degree of ReS reduction implemented and the required ERP of the jammer and other indicators of the onboard EW equipment. The problem of counteracting high-precision electronic support measures (ESM) equipment, used with active jammers on the aircraft, can be solved when doing a comprehensive analysis of the entire set of problems and, in particular, by conducting organizational measures when preparing for and waging EW. The equation (7.2) also indicates the potential for increasing the degree of radar jamming by increasing the absorption coefficient ex and the length of the path with increased absorption. The thermal detectability of aircraft is due to radiation from the engine, the heated gasses of the jet stream at the exhaust output (at a distance not exceeding 2-3m), and the surface that is heated as a result of aerodynamic drag when flying at supersonic speeds. It follows from the optoelectronic jamming equation (6.20) that the reduction of thermal detectability of an aircraft (as in the case with radar detectability) permits a proportional decrease in the radiation intensities of thermal decoys and other 0 E J devices. The potential reduction of the thermal detectability of aircraft depends greatly on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This law is characterized by expres- sions (6.24) and (6.25), with which we calculate the radiation power density. According to the law mentioned, the thermal detectability changes propor- tionally to the fourth power of the temperature of the engine components and gases at the exhaust output. For this reason, even small changes in the engine operating mode have a significant influence on the thermal detect- ability of aircraft. For example, when changing the engine to the afterburner mode of operation, the exhaust temperature is increased by a factor of 1.4- 1.5, which, according to (6.22), leads to an increase in radiation density of 4- 5. A reduction in radiation is achieved by converting a turbojet engine to using serpentine input and exhaust ducts. Particularly, in the tactical U.S. Airforce F-117 A fighter, two nonafterburning engines with serpentine ducts are installed [1]. The maximum of the radiation pattern for the aircraft can be oriented in a less dangerous direction. Also, ability of water vapor and carbon dioxide to absorb infrared radiation at wavelengths 2.7 and 4.3 ~m should be kept in mind. Along with the problem of decreasing radar and thermal detectability of aircraft in the dynamics of flight, the problem of concealing aircraft at airports and other bases is becoming a high priority, because of the appearance of intelligence-and-strike complexes and other systems of high- precision weapons."},{"pageNumber":350,"pageContent":"330 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare 7.2 Modern Technologies for the Development of Aircraft with Low Radar Detectability and Problems of EW Dynamics As the experience of implementation of \"STEALTH\" technology shows, the aerodynamic and electrodynamic design of aircraft with an ReS not exceeding 0.1-0.01 m 2 over a broad band of carrier frequencies, is possible at the present time only through synthesis, combining methods of computational aerodynamics and applied electrodynamics with the application of modern computers. The ultimate result of synthesis is the definition of rational aerodynamic and electrodynamic designs that ensure a level of backscattering of a radar signal that does not exceed a specified value within a certain solid angle. The power density of backscattering (the Umov-Poynting modulus vector), observed in a given direction for a fixed electromagnetic field density illuminating an aircraft unambiguously determines its ReS in the given direction. When we speak of back- scattering, we normally presume that the radar receiver and transmitter are collocated. Aircraft, including those implemented in the \"STEALTH\" program, have a quite complex form. Backscattering is a superposition of fields reflected from a comparatively large number of components. The geometric size of each of the components exceeds by many times (by two or three orders of magnitude) the radar wavelength in the centimeter bands, and, by smaller factors in the decimeter bands. According to the basic concept of \"STEALTH\", the shape of each component, its position and its orientation are determined with due consideration to aerodynamic limitations, in such a way as to minimize the back scattered power density. The latter is calculated by solving problems of the electromagnetic field diffraction on elements of corresponding shapes and sizes. Backscattering from diffraction on the given component is character- ized by its envelope and initial phase. The average value of the backscattered power density over the RF cycle determines the ReS value corresponding to the given component. The sum of Res components for individual elements comprises the ReS of the aircraft as a whole. When summing up the ReS elements, it is necessary to consider that, under flight conditions, the envelopes and initial phases of the backscattering of individual elements is random. Moreover, the randomization of back scattering is also implemented deliberately with the purpose of reducing, when all other conditions are equal, the radar detection probability of the signal reflected from the aircraft. This follows from the expressions (1.4), (1.5) and (1.8), which determine the"},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Methods of Reducing Aircraft Detectability 331 detection probabilities by receivers optimized according to the Neyman- Pearson criteria, for a totally known signal and for a signal with a random initial phase and envelope. In order to obtain the required degree of reduction in backscattering, calculations of rational shapes and aerodynamic design of aircraft are used in addition to radio absorbing materials (RAM) and coverings and controllable impedance structures that permit adaptive control of scattering. The necessity of this is stipulated by limitations in the aerodynamic design of an ai~craft and its propulsion system. The use of RAM and adaptive scattering coverings provides for a compromise between the demands of aerodynamics and electrodynamics. We should separately note the problem of reducing detectability of antenna devices in onboard radio equipment of aircraft. This issue is examined in the material that follows. To the extent we can judge from material published on the B-2 and F- 117 A aircraft, developed and deployed in the arsenal of the U.S. Air Force at the present time and implemented using \"STEALTH\" technology, RCS values for the B-2 are as = 1 m 2 , and for the F-117A - from the front hemisphere as = 0.01 m 2 , and from other aspects as = 0.025 m 2 [1, 2]. American specialists consider it possible to attain an RCS of the order of 0.001 m 2 [3]. This latter circumstance resulted in unfounded assertions about the undesirability of placing onboard devices for generating active jamming on aircraft implemented using \"STEALTH\" technology. Concerning this issue, it should be noted that such assertions are metaphysical in nature. They don't take into account the specifics of the developmental dialectics of EW systems and techniques as an element of armed conflict. We confirm what has been mentioned using individual examples. Aerodynamic and electrodynamic aircraft designs developed using \"STEA TH\" technology have been accomplished using approximate methods of solving the corresponding aerodynamics diffraction problems. Their strict solutions for the majority of the scattering elements entering in the aerodynamic designs are unknown, and calculations for known solutions require unacceptably large amounts of machine time to per- form. As is testified to by materials pu1?lished [4], the solution to scattering problems in the process if implementing \"STEALTH\" technology ~as performed using an approximation of the physical diffraction theory d\"eveloped by P. Va. Ufimtsev [5] and providing sufficient precision in asymptotic approximations for practical purposes. Specifically, it is assumed that the parameter AI a(AI a < < 1) will be small, where A is the \\ wavelength and a is a certain characteristic size for the scattering element, for example, in the case of diffraction from a disk - its radius. It should be borne in mind that, when using other known methods, the solution to"},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"332 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare diffraction problems is found in asymptotic approximation [6]. We may assume that the degree of RCS reduction in aircraft achieved using \"STEALTH\" technology applies to the centimeter and decimeter wavebands. In the meter waveband, especially in those cases where there are components of the aircraft of sizes that are half-wave multiples of the radar, the RCS of the aircraft can increase significantly. The angular coordinate resolution problem that arises in the meter waveband is solved using synthesized antenna radar. The detection of aircraft with low detectability can be performed successfully using multistatic radar. Aerodynamic and electrodynamic designs synthesized using \"STEALTH\" technology provide for the reduc- tion of backscattering in a limited range of angles. The scattered radiation in other directions can significantly exceed the backscattering. The well-known Babinet principle from optics should not be forgotten, according to which the substitution of a transparent screen in a certain aperture with a supplementary (nontransparent) one does not change the Fraunhofer diffraction picture in the focal plane of the lens with the exception of the focus itself. There are also other possibilities of increasing the radar effectiveness for aircraft with low detectability [7]. It would seem to be convenient to use cost/effectiveness criteria when solving the problem of reducing radar detectability, in specific media, by determining the relationship between the Res and the composition and parameters of the onboard jamming complex, bearing in mind the necessity of counteracting not only radar, but also high-precision AAD ESM systems. 7.2.1 Radio Absorptive Coatings Let us consider the reflection of a plane electromagnetic wave from an infinite ideally conducting surface coated with a substance characterized by a complex dielectric (e') and magnetic (Jl') permittivity (Figure 7.1): (7.4) (7.5) Here, e = eoe is the dielectric permittivity of the coating (in free space e' = co); e~/ co = e r is the relative dielectric permittivity of the coating; e~/ co = elC is the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity resulting from dielectric losses and the electrical conductance of the surface;"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"! \".\" - Absorptive coating Object Methods of Reducing Aircraft DetectabiJif:) Figure 7.1 The reflection of a plane electromagnetic wave from an infinite ideally conducting coated surface. 333 Jl' = JloJl is the magnetic permittivity of the coating (in free space Jl' = flo); Jl~/Jlo = flr is the relative magnetic permittivity of the coating; ~/Jlo = Jlx: is the imaginary part of the magnetic permittivity resulting from losses.

In the first case, (expression (7.15) equal to zero) the surface absorbs magnetic energy, and in the second (expression (7.16) equal to zero) electrical energy is absorbed (Ohmic losses). The thickness of the absorptive coating didn't enter into formulas (7.15) and (7.16). In the given case it can be assumed to be c~mparatively large. In practice, however, it is necessary to provide for a sufficient degree of attenuation of radiation by coatings of limited thickness. When doing this, segments with a wave impedance of the order of Z = 377 ohm (free space) and of the order of Z = 0 ohm (metallic surface) should be matched. Practically speaking, the problem is solved by using multilayer absorptive coatings in which each of the layers can be considered to be a wave impedance transformer providing matching of adjacent layers. The input impedance Zinp of a certain ith layer of thickness d j is determined from the expreSSion: (7.23) where flj and Cj are the complex magnetic and dielectric permittivities of the"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"336 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare absorptive material in the ith layer determined using (7.13) and (7.14); ko = 21t/A is the wave number in free space. The number of absorptive layers in the coating, in principle, can be quite large. Speaking of the thickness of the RAM, it is necessary to bear the following in mind. When a plane wave is reflected from a metallic surface, a standing wave of the electrical field is formed with an antinode at a distance of Ae/4 from the conductor (Ae is the wavelength in the dielectric). For this reason, the thickness of a dielectric RAM coating must be selected so that the antinode region of the electrical field is located in the coating. The most intensive absorption takes place precisely in this region of the dielectric. For the purpose of maximizing this absorption, short metallic fibers are introduced in the region of the dielectric corresponding to the antinode. In the case of RAM with magnetic losses (ferromagnetics), the thickness of the covering can be comparatively small, since the magnetic field antinode occurs directly on the metallic surface. At the present time RAMs are being developed on the basis of both analytical and experimental methods [8-11]. The simplest is the analysis method [10]. In this case, additional elements that conduct electricity and contain magnets are introduced in the composite materials that modify the complex dielectric and magnetic permeabilities, as well as the conductance of the mixtures. The short metallic fibers located in the mixture are reradiators (scatterers) of electromagnetic energy and can comprise up to 3% of the mass. Particles of magnetite are sprayed as magnet-containing additives [10]. On the basis of the variant adopted for the distribution of electro- magnetic parameters in the coating structure, its electrodynamic model is justified and calculations are performed to determine reflection or transmis- sion coefficients in a specified frequency band. The problems of synthesis are more complex, involving the construc- tion of the coating so as to provide for the minimum reflection coefficient in the given frequency band for minimum thickness and mass. Problems of synthesis also involve the determination of the electromagnetic parameters of the component parts of the ingredient materials and their distribution within the thickness of the layer, providing for optimum characteristics for the RAM for a given frequency band and a maximum permissible reflection coefficient [9, 10]. The synthesis of the layered nonhomogeneous structure of a RAM with optimum parameters can be made using the solution of the electro- dynamic problem of the propagation of radio waves in a layered absorbing medium, the properties of which constantly change in the direction Z (Figure 7.2).

For the mth approximation, the following iteration formula is obtained: m = 1,2,3 ... where L(Z) = 2 f~ ~(Z)dZ is the phase length; when m = 1, Ro = O. In essence, the problem of RAM synthesis for a small reflection level consists of the definition and implementation in practice of an optimal law for changing the phase factor gradient grad~(z) considering the decrease in the complex amplitude of the incident wave as Z increases. At the same time, the thickness of the absorptive coating is also minimized. RAMs of the type considered are called gradient RAMs. Normally real absorbing materials and coatings of the gradient type are implemented as a set of layers with constant parameters approximating the required law for the change of the complex index of refraction. Other ways of solving the problems of analyzing and synthesizing an ideal RAM structure are also known [9, 12]. The required attenuation of the reflected electromagnetic wave and the corresponding maximum permissible value of the reflection coefficient Rare determined by the specific conditions of solving the problem of reducing radar detectability. As concerns \"STEALTH\" technology, this is a result of the requirement to reach a compromise between the requirements of aerodynamics and electrodynamics. In the case of concealing aircraft at airports and other surface targets, it is sufficient to reduce the RCS to a level ensuring the \"matching\" of the target detectability to that of the surround- ing area. Below, as examples, we provide the characteristics of specific types of RAM [8, 10, 11]. Composite RAM can be developed on the basis for ferrite-rubber mixtures with the addition of metallic fibers. One of the RAM samples [10] provides for an absorption of more than 15 dB in the 8-26 GHz range and more than 20 dB at a frequency of 4.5 GHz. The possibility of using composite materials of this type at frequencies of 30, 60 MHz and 1 G Hz are shown. Composite RAM using fibers from graphite of carbon, boron, polyethylene and polyvinylchloride with a ferrite filler also permits signifi- cant decrease in aircraft detectability. Thus, at a frequency of 11.6 GHz, a three-layer RAM with an overall thickness of 10.7 mm provides for a reflection coefficient of the order of -16 dB at angles of incidence from 0 to 30 degrees. High-quality RAM with increased resistance to fire provides for a reflection coefficient of -30 to -50 dB over a broad band of frequencies"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Methods of Reducing Aircraft Detectability 339 from 100 MHz to 40 GHz. A new trend in the development of RAM is a coating developed by a group of specialists from the Center for Molecular Electronics at the Pittsburgh Carnegie-Mellon University (USA) on the basis of Shiffer retinil salts, which, according to the opinion of its creators, can be applied with a brush like paint to the object to be protected. Shiffer retinil salts are much lighter than ferrites, but are comparable in their ability to absorb HF and UHF radiation. We shall note, for example, that a mass of 1 m 2 of ferrite absorbent of the brand NZ-l with a thickness of 2.4 cm comprises about 250 kg [11]. 7.2.2 Interference and Diffusion Radio Absorbing Coatings The reduction of the reflection coefficient in interference coatings is achieved as a result of the absorption of electromagnetic energy in the material. of the coating, as well as the partial cancellation of the reflected signal due to interference. The simplest interference coating is a fine homogeneous layer of ferrite with thickness d, placed on a metallic substrate (Figure 7.3). The coating is matched to free space by selecting a definite relationship of the value of magnetic losses in the coating, its thickness d and the wavelength A.. According to (7.6) and with considera- tion to (7.24), the reflection coefficient R, from such a coating, is determined using the following expression: R = Zinp - 1 = ....:...J%_1l ~=e....-th_(_~_ejIk_od_) _-_1 Zinp + 1 J% th (y'eiikod) + 1 (7.25) where J.l and e are determined using (7.13) and (7.14); ko = 21t/A. is the wave number, and A. is the wavelength in free space.

Ferromagnetic materials of the type NZ-l and NZ-2 from the Emerson company are intended for the attenuation of reflections in the waveband from units of centimeters up to 6-Sm. The thickness of coating NZ-l is d = 2.4 cm, and of NZ-2 is d = 0.6 cm. Interference coatings are implemented on a dielectric basis with the inclusion in the antinode region of an electrical field of conducting fibers. The antinodes are located at a distance from the metallic substrate which is a multiple of an uneven number of quarters of the wavelength in the dielectric. In the practice of developing anechoic chambers, as well as for the solution of specific problems of antenna technology and anti radar conceal- ment, various radio absorbing materials of the diffusive type are used. The surface of such materials is distinguished by high geometric heterogeneity. A typical example is the pyramidal diffusive RAM, the surface of which is a set of pyramids with a square base and a constant distance between the summits of adjacent pyramids, which is equal to I. In the long-wave part of the band, when 1 > > A, the coating acts as a gradient RAM. In the short-wave part of the band (I < < A), multiple wave reflection occurs from the edges of adjacent pyramids, which significantly increases the effectiveness of the coating such that the reflection coefficient R may possibly not exceed -50 dB. For concealment in ground-based conditions, absorbing coatings are made in the form of hair, rubber or wooden mats, saturated with a mixture of neoprene (a type of rubber) and soot. Such mats with a thickness of several centimeters are capable of reducing the reflected signal power by 13- 17 dB. Regarding materials at hand, coatings from wet hay and grass can be used with success."},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Methods of Reducing Aircraft Detectability 341 7.2.3 Controlling the Scattering of Radio Waves A significant reduction in the RCS of the target can be achieved in principle by controlling the parameters of the scattered field. The objective of such control is to change the properties of the target as a reradiating source to such a degree that the energy scattered in the required direction is minimum [9, 13-16]. One of the first suggested techniques of controlling scattering was the attachment of a complex load to the reflecting object. This technique has a certain similarity with the techniques described above for decreasing RCS using antiradar coatings. However, the difference in principle is that a complex load is attached to a local region whose dimensions are significantly less than those of the target as a whole. The loaded region in the particular case can be a gap with concentrated or distributed loads.

The secondary field at receiving point B can be represented as the result of superposition of two fields. One of them is the field of the nonloaded body T a, and the second is the field of the loaded aperture s. It is worthwhile mentioning that, in view of the small area of the aperture s, the overall configuration of the target and its area can be considered to be unchanged. 8 I Receiver P Transmitter Figure 7.4 Target Ta with coupling aperture s, loaded for a complex load."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"342 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare The scattered field of aperture s is determined by the form of the aperture and the parameters of the load impedance. By adjusting these parameters, it is possible to change the distribution of the amplitude and phase of the field scattered by the gap and, as a result, to achieve the required decrease in the resulting field at receiving point B. The relative ReS change of a loaded target can be evaluated using [16] Z Z+ A crill = (1 _ ex,)2 1 - ex,* crll Z+ZA (7.27) where cr llt is the ReS of the nonloaded target; crll is the ReS of the loaded target; Z A is the equivalent complex load from the side of its attachment points in the absence of illumination by transmitter A; Z is the complex load; and ex,* is the function of the separation of the transmitter from the receiver and shape of the target, as well as the place of the gap on the target and the nature of the load.

At present, the known principles for the practical implementation of scattering control systems presume the use of impedance coatings, one variant of which is the intelligent reflecting structure [14, 15].

In order to adapt to the environment and to preclude unauthorized access to control of the ferrite components, in other words, to ensure the information stability of the scattering control system in the dynamics of EW, it is necessary to provide for appropriate data- and knowledge bases in the microprocessor, determining the intelligence level of the structure. An information support system must also be provided for, including above means for ESM, which in principle can automate the decision making process for scattering parameters depending on the evolving radio environ- ment. Anisotropy and nonlinear properties of the magnetized ferrites permit the deliberate automatic change of the reflective properties of the impedance surface over a quite broad range of values. Analyzing the question of intelligent coatings used in military technology, we should keep in mind that the characteristics of the coating can change depending on the meteorological and combat conditions. In the mass media, cases have bee~ noted where rain and snow have influenced the detectability of \"STEALTH\" airplanes. It can be assumed that such effects increase as the level of \"STEALTH\" technology increases and the RCS of aircraft correspondingly decreases. This circumstance once again stresses the requirement to solve the problem of aircraft detectability by an optimum combination of its RCS value and the ERP of onboard jamming systems."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"346 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare 7.3 Potential for Reducing Radar Detectability of Aircraft Antennas - Optimum Gain for Jammer Antennas 7.3.1 Potential for Reducing Radar Detectability of Aircraft Antennas The number of antennas for various purposes onboard a modern aircraft is quite large. Many of them, if special measures are not taken, can prove to be unmasking elements for an aircraft built using \"STEALTH\" technology. Indeed, let us assume that the RCS of the aircraft has been reduced to a level of -10 dBm 2 and that there is a linear antenna installed on it with a length of the order of 0.6Q-O.6Sm. The RCS of this antenna, considered as a half-wave reradiator, for a meter-range radar (A = 1.2-1.3m) when polarizations match, is 0' = 1.1-1.6 dBm 2 (i.e., it exceeds the RCS of the aircraft itself by more than an order of magnitude). If the RCS of the aircraft is reduced to a lower value, for example, to a value of -20 dBm2, then such a target can be unmasked by a linear antenna that is only 10 cm in length, the RCS of which for a radar on the 20 cm range is O'A = 4.7 dBm2, which exceeds the original aircraft RCS by 15.3 dB. These examples show that without a solution to the problem of reducing radar detectability of onboard antennas, work on reducing the detectability of aircraft practically speaking makes no sense. The problems become more acute as the level of detectability of the aircraft as a whole decreases. In turn, the problem of reducing the radar detectability of aircraft antennas requires the development of new antenna technologies. At the present time, a comparatively large number of works are known devoted to solving the problem of reducing the detectability of aircraft antennas [18]. In the first approximation, they can be summarized as follows. The reduction of the number of antennas on board the aircraft by replacing most of them with a multifunction antenna system using a conformal phased antenna array (P AA). It is assumed that such an antenna provides a solution to the problems of radar, radio communications, radio navigation and, possibly,. jamming. The external surface of a P AA is selected so as to minimize the backscattering of external radar signals. One of the problems in a multifunctioning P AA is providing isolation between its concurrently functioning subsystems for various purposes. Certain proposals solving particular problems are of interest. For example, it has been proposed to cover radar antennas with a large metallic screen with gaps cut in its surface. By selecting parameters, it is possible to limit the polarization and frequency pass band of the screen to only a given radar. For external radiation of a different frequency and polarization, the"},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"r - Methods of Redllcing Aircraft Detectability 347 antenna with this screen appears as an object with low backscattering. It is asserted that the antenna RCS in this case can be reduced approximately by 30 dB. Reduction of the radar detectability of linear antennas in the meter and decameter ranges is achieved by using ferrite coatings with a high magnetic permittivity Il, applied to the metallic base from which the antenna is made. At the same time, electrical characteristics are retained and the RCS in the centimeter waveband is reduced. An effective means of decreasing the radar detectability of linear antennas is the use of reactive loads, as discussed earlier. It would seem to be possible to synthesize linear antennas with reactive loads included in them that minimize the backscattered power while retaining their basic electrical characteristics. One decreasing radar detectability of large aircraft antennas is the use of plasma generated in a space covered with a cowl, within which the atmosphere pressure has been reduced. In order to reduce significantly backscattering at frequency f, the density of electrons in the plasma (N ell cm 3 ) must be greater than or equal to the electron concentration No determined by the plasma frequency fo [19]: fo=8960~ (7.28) In the case of counteracting a radar in the 10-cm band (fo = 3 x 10 9 Hz), it is necessary to ensure No = 10 15 el/cm3. This is a quite high concentration. All the same, an onboard radar in the 3-cm band with a somewhat reduced ERP (PsG s ) can still operate because the critical electron concentration is 1.1 X 10 16 el/cm3, an order of magnitude higher than for a radar in the 10-cm band. In the general case, there exists a problem controlling the concentration of electrons under the cowl in the dynamics of onboard radar operations. An original suggestion is to decrease the radar detectability of antennas by using a controlled multilayer sheet applied directly to the antenna surface. Such a sheet is a set of flat controlled and uncontrolled layers. It is proposed to use powerful p-i-n diodes and ferroelectric ceramic capacitors as control elements. The uncontrolled layers can be lossless homogeneous dielectrics or two-dimensional periodic arrays. Such sheets are analogous to the controlled impedance structures mentioned earlier. As one of the more radical suggestions, it is possible to consider the miniaturization of reradiators in the centimeter waveband. It is suggested to use ferrite elements as P AA reradiators. In particular, in receiving operations mode, it was suggested to use parametric amplifiers made from ferrites."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"348 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare It should be noted once again that, without solving the problems of the detectability of onboard antennas, just as without a comprehensive analysis, it would not seem to be possible to come up with a satisfactory solution to the problem of aircraft detectability as a whole. The key factor here is the cost/effectiveness criterion. It would seem that the solution of the problem only by reducing Res is not very promising. As was noted earlier, it can be solved only by a combination of decreasing the ReS and determining the optimum value of the jammer ERP, which is determined as the product of the jammer power P j and the gain of its antenna G j . 7.3.2 Optimum Transmitting Antenna Gain in an Aircraft (Helicopter) Jammer The effectiveness of radar jamming depends on the ERP of the active jammer. An erroneous opinion has been formed that almost limitless increase in jammer ERP is possible using highly-directional antennas (for example, a PAA with a large number of elements and a large aperture). However, limitations exist on the gain of a jammer antenna, associated with the effect of antenna size on the radar detectability of the aircraft being protected. When the gain of the antenna G j increases, as is known, the jammer ERP increases. However, the increase in G j is a result of an increase in antenna size, which, in its turn, causes an increase in the radar detectability of the aircraft due to the increase in the contribution of the ReS of the antenna cr A to the total ReS of the aircraft crTa. When the equivalent ReS of the antenna 0\" A becomes commensurate with the ReS of the aircraft O\"Ta, further increase in the jammer ERP due to the increase in the antenna gain does not lead to an increase in jamming effectiveness. Moreover, jamming effectiveness, when the value of G j is too large, can be significantly reduced. Let us determine the optimum value of the transmitting antenna gain G opt ' for which we use the self-screening jamming equation: (7.29) Here, P j is the jammer power; G j is the jammer antenna gain; P s is the radar transmitter power; G s is the radar transmitting antenna gain; D j is the distance between the radar and the jammer; and O\"TaE is the total ReS of the aircraft."},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Methods of Reducing Aircraft Detectability 349 The total ReS of the aircraft on which the jammer is installed can be determined using the expression: (7.30) where crTa is the ReS of the aircraft in the absence of a jammer antenna; and cr A is the ReS of the jammer antenna. The ReS of the aircraft cr Ta depends on the type of aircraft and is usually determined experimentally. The ReS of the jammer antenna cr A depends on the effective antenna area A and the degree of its matching to free space and the load (the output stage of the transmitter). In accordance with the reciprocity theorem, the transmitting antenna, having aperture SA, can be replaced by an equivalent receiving antenna, loaded by the complex load Z, (Figure 7.9). Whe~ a plane wave is incident on an antenna with field intensity E, the power of the field received by the antenna is equal to (7.31 ) where p = (J~~) is the power density of the incident wave; A is the effective area of the antenna aperture; and (IE21) is the mean square electrical field intensity.

Consider the phenomena of refraction and reflection. As is kno\\vn from electrodynamics, the reflection of electromagnetic waves occurs in all cases when the macroscopic parameters of heterogeneity n = ~ and the conductance cr differ from the corresponding parameters of the environ- ment in which radio waves propagate. The refraction of radio waves occurs for this same reason. Thus, to ensure a significant reflection of radio waves using ionized formations, corresponding local change in the macroscopic parameters of the environment Jl and c are necessary. The use of the macroscopic parameters mentioned as electrical characteristics of the environment is permissible, if the average distance between the particles forming the environment is much less than the wavelength (d « A) (i.e., when the environment seems to be continuous for the incident and propagating waves). Errors in the determination of the direction of arrival of the radio wave occur when the local heterogeneity, is itself heterogeneous (i.e., its refraction coefficient is a function of coordinates (Figure 7.13)). Errors in determining the direction can, in principle, also occur with constant electrical parameters of local heterogeneity, if this heterogeneity has a suitable form (for example, nonrectangular). The index of refraction of an ionized environment (local heterogene- ity), ignoring the Earth's magnetic field, is calculated approximately using the following formula: Environment with a variable refraction coefficient Radio beam trajectory Figure 7.13 Errors in the determination of the direction of arrival of the radio wave."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"356 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare Here, 1 is the carrier frequency in Hertz; and N is the electron density per cubic meter. When the concentration of electrons is quite high, radio waves can be fully reflected from the ionized region (full internal reflection). The critical frequency corresponding to the full reflection of radio waves is determined from the condition n = 0, whence it follows that F = 9N 1 / 2 cr corresponds to the plasma frequency 10 determined by (7.28). Thus, to obtain full reflection of waves with a carrier frequency I, it is necessary to have an electron density: N = 1:/ 81 el/m 3 For example, for a wave A = 3 cm we obtain N = 10 18 el/m 3 , or N = 10 12 el/cm 3 . To ensure the specified concentration of electrons (N), it is necessary to have powerful sources of ionization. The required electron production rate of the source of ionization is equal to I = a.N 2 , where a. is the electron recombination rate, equal at the Earth's surface to approximately a. = 10 9 cm 3 /sec·el. At N = 10 12 el/cm 3 and a. = 10- 9 cm 3 /sec.el, the ionization rate must be I = 10 15 el/cm 3 ·sec. In other words, to create an ionized region with a concentration of 10 12 electrons per cubic centimeter, the ionization source must create in 1 sec 10 15 electrons per cubic centimeter. Such a high concentration of electrons can be created by rapid burning of large quantities of easily ionized elements, for example, cesium, or with high energy electron beams or several laser beams of equal wavelength [21].

When nuclear ammunition explodes, in the epicenter of the explosion large concentrations of electrons are formed. However, as a result of their recombination, the concentration of electrons quickly decreases with time so that the interference of a nuclear explosion on radar in the centimeter range is quite short lived. High-altitude nuclear explosions have a more significant effect on the propagation of waves in the meter range. Consider the absorbing properties of locally ionized media. The mechanism of absorbing radio waves in an ionized region can be explained in the following manner. Free electrons under the influence of an electric field of an incident wave experience forced oscillations with a frequency,"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"Methods of Reducing Aircraft Detectability 357 equal to the carrier frequency of electromagnetic waves. In the process of oscillating motions, the electrons collide with neutral molecules, atoms and ions and increase their kinetic energy. Thus, electromagnetic field energy is converted into thermal energy in the medium. The absorbing property of an ionized region is characterized by the absorption coefficient (dB/km): (7.54) where N is the electron density per m 3 ; v is the number of collisions of electrons with other particles (ions, atoms, and gas molecules) per second; and CO is the angular frequency. From (7.54) it follows that the absorption coefficient has maximum at a certain collision frequency. Using the 'rule for finding the maximum of a function, we obtain that ~ = ~max at CO = v. . The collision frequency v is proportional to the air density. For this reason there is a certain interval of atmospheric altitudes beyond which the attenuation of radio waves is small. Calculations and experimental studies show that the attenuation of radio waves is greatest in a 16-km band with a center located at an altitude of approximately 72 km. The number of collisions at an altitude of 72 km is approximately equal to V = 6 X 10 6 collisions per second. For signals with carrier frequencies f > 5 MHz, the value co 2 in (7.54) is significantly greater than V due to which (7.55) The attenuation of shorter waves does not increase at low altitudes because the lifetime of electrons is reduced and the initial assumptions on which formula (7.54) is based become invalid. Using (7.55), it is possible to determine the required electron density providing for the specified attenuation ~ in dB/km: To obtain, for example, an attenuation of ~ = 10 dB/km at an altitude of 72 km for a wavelength A, = 3 cm, the ionized region must have an electron density N = 0.37 X 10 18 el/m 3 . At the present time, such a high concentra- tion for large extents can be created only for a very short time using high energy electron beams or lasers."},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"358 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare Let us evaluate the potential for implementing a local region of atmospheric ionization to reduce aircraft radar detectability.

The examples considered show that, to implement the required reduction in aircraft radar detectability, a quite high electron density is required when flying at a sufficiently high altitude (v = 10 7 l/s). If we bear in mind that the performance coefficient of modern ionizers does not surpass 0.1, then the required powers for primary current sources must comprise hundreds of kW. 7.4.2 The Effect of Nuclear Explosions on the Operations of Radio Systems Explosions at altitudes less than 16 km do not result in lengthy ionization, so they do not have a significant effect on the work of radio systems. In the case of surface (underground or underwater) explosions regions may be formed in which intense absorption and reflection of radio waves occur. However, the effect of absorption and reflection of radio waves in this case is not associated with the ionization of space, but with the presence of local heterogeneity of the environment, having a high concentration of particles of solid substances and water thrown into the atmosphere. The effective influence on the operations of radio systems in the centimeter range due to the products of the explosion can be exerted only during the initial stage of the explosion. The duration of ionized regions depends on the altitude and the force of the explosion, the time of day etc. At high altitudes (> 40-50 km) quite stable regions are formed with relatively high concentrations of electrons. In the case of the explosion of nuclear ammunition at high altitudes, ionized regions with a small concentration of electrons (10 10 _10 11 ) can exist for several minutes and even for hours. In the first approximation, it is possible to distinguish ionized regions of two types. First of all, there are regions of slow electrons, formed as a result of ionization of the environment, primarily, thermal x-rays. These regions have comparatively limited sizes, tens and hundreds of kilometers, and the concentration of electrons in them decreases approximately according to the law:"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"360 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare Here, t is the time in seconds. The development of the region in time, after its formation, proceeds basically according to the laws for diffusion. Secondly, there are regions of fast (relativistic) electrons (p-particles), irradiated by radioactive products of fission. Fast electrons are caught up by the Earth's magnetic field, in which case the ionization of space on the scale of the Earth assumes a global character (and not local, as was stated earlier). Consider this issue in more detail, recalling several initial physical prerequisites. A charge e, moving with velocity v in a magnetic field with intensity H, is acted upon by a Lorentz force F determined by the formula: F = e[vR] This force, all other conditions being equal, is proportional to the speed of the particles. If the magnetic field is homogeneous (i.e., its force lines are parallel to one another), then the trajectory of the charged particle, having entered the magnetic field with a velocity of v is a cylindrical spiral with a constant pitch, wound around a force line. The radius of the cylinder (radius of gyration) is determined using the formula: r = Inv(eH) In a heterogeneous field the trajectory of motion of the charged particle becomes much more complex. Particularly, as the charged particle moves in the heterogeneous magnetic field in the direction of increasing field intensity, the charged particle will be acted upon by a force pushing it into a region of lower field intensity values (in the direction of motion of the particle, the force lines of the magnetic field converge) [23]. The appearance of this force is a result of the magnetic field component H2 (Figure 7.14), the magnitude of which increases together with the heterogeneity of the field (the greater the angle y). If the field H were heterogeneous, then all its force lines would be parallel to the component Hl (y = 0) and the component H2 would be equal to zero. The heterogeneity of the field generates the component H 2 • Let us review a simpler case: the motion of an electron along a circular orbit in a heterogeneous field (Figure 7.14). The component Hl of magnetic field H generates a centripetal force providing the electron with a rotational movement. The component H 2 , acting at point 0 on the electron, moving with velocity v, generates a force F(H 2 ), pushing the particle into the region of the minimum field. The presence of this force in a"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Methods of Reducing Aircraft Detectability 361 H Figure 7.14 The trajectory of motion of a charged particle in a heterogeneous field. heterogeneous magnetic field and the heterogeneity itself lead to a significant transformation of the spiral trajectory. In Figure 7.15 we depict the approximate trajectory of an electron in a heterogeneous magnetic field. As the electron progresses into the region of greater concentration of magnetic force lines, the pitch of the spiral and the radius of gyration decrease. Since the Lorentz forces in the first approximation don't change the absolute value of the particle velocity, then, as the longitudinal movement of the electron slows down due to the braking force, the velocity component V1, perpendicular to H 1 , will of necessity increase. More in- depth studies indicate that the ratio vf / H can be considered to be Figure 7.15 The approximate trajectory of an electron in a heterogeneous magnetic field."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"362 Fundamentals of Electronic Warfare approximately constant during the entire time the particle is in motion. This circumstance permits us to find the angle cx between the velocity vector of the particle and the direction of the force line at the given moment of time, if the initial angle CXo is known at the moment the particle enters the magnetic field. Accordingly, we have (Figure 7.16) (7.61 ) Hence, sin cx = sin cxo(H/Ho)1/2 For the specified angle cxo, let us determine the intensity of the magnetic field at which forward movement ceases into the region of greater concentration of magnetic force lines (sin CX = 1): H = Ho/(sin 2 cxo) The electron cannot penetrate into the region of greater magnetic field intensity. Having reached the indicated region of the magnetic field, the electron begins moving in the opposite direction.

If the maximum intensities of the magnetic field at the poles are identical (Hmax) , then the possibility of reflecting an electron from the magnetic mirror is determined by angle CXo. All particles for which sin CXo > (Ho/H;!a~) will be reflected from the magnetic mirrors formed at the poles. Thus, the magnetic field of the Earth, for the particles mentioned, in fact serves as a \"magnetic trap.\" The regions in space, in which the reflection of electrons from \"magnetic mirror\" occurs, are called conjugate points (At and A2 in Figure 7.18). The conjugate points can in principle also not coincide with the magnetic poles. The formula (7.61) permits us to find the conjugate points in other sectors of space near the Earth. Electrons, caught up by the magnetic field of the Earth, moving along the magnetic force lines, concurrently experience a \"magnetic drift\" from west to east. The \"magnetic drift\" of electrons is caused by a decrease in magnetic field intensity for altitude. The physical reason for the \"magnetic drift\" of electrons due to the decrease in the field along the radius is illustrated in Figure 7.19. In Figure 7.19 we depict the direct current magnetic field I, decreasing along the radius R, flowing along a direct wire.

In sector A, the radius of gyration ,,-ill be less than in sector B with a lesser magnetic field intensity. After completing the first loop, the electron, moving as shown in Figure 7.19, will end up somew'hat lower than its initial point of motion. During subsequent reyolutions it ,,-ill constantly drift in the direction, opposite to the direction of the current I generating the given magnetic field. From here it directly follo\\vs that, in conditions on Earth, electrons, moving along force lines, \"shift\" from \\vest to east. Accordingly, presumably charged particles \"drift\" from east to \\vest. An analogous phenomenon occurs in the Earth's so-called radiation belts. Thus, due to the quick electrons formed during a high-altitude nuclear explosion, the ionization of space near the Earth assumes a global character. However, the density of electrons on the average turns out to be lo\\v, and the effects described have no noticeable influence on the operation of radar systems, with the exception, perhaps, of radar of the meter range, \\vorking in the region where conjugate points are formed. As concerns communications and radio navigation equipment, especially in the short wave and middle wave bands, then here there can be serious disruptions in operations for a comparatively long time. The lifetime of global ionized regions consisting of quick electrons depends on the height of conjugate points above the Earth. If the conjugate points are located in a region of increased atmospheric density, then the loss of electrons occurs more quickly due to absorption by neutral molecules and positive ions located in the region of magnetic mirrors. The absorption of quick electrons leads to the ionization of space in the vicinity of the conjugate points. The loss of electrons outside the conjugate points, as a rule, is insignificant. When nuclear ammunition was exploded at an altitude of 480 km (operation \"Argus\"), the formation of clearly expressed layers with a thickness of approximately 100 km was observed. The ionized regions remained for several days [24, 25].
