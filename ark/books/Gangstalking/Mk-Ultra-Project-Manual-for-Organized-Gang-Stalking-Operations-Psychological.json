These same techniques, and perhaps this same manual, were evidently also used in the FBI’s COINTELPRO (counter - intel ligence program) and Operation Gladio/Stay Behind Operations in Europe between about 1950 and 1990. They also accurately describe the U.S. Military - Intelligence’s ongoing, global gang stalking operations as documented in “New World War: Revolutionary Metho ds for Political Control” by Mark M. Rich (2011). All these top - secret operations went on, officially undetected, for decades; Gladio/Stay Behind functioned secretly and illegally throughout Europe for four decades, when it was exposed in 1990 by Italian P rime Minister Andriotti. Shortly thereafter, the European Parliament made a resolution condemning Gladio (see Appendix 1), but acknowledged that it may still be operational! Like American author, Gloria Naylor (see her book, “1996”), and countless others, Dr. Rauni Kilde was a “Targeted Individual” (TI) for decades. She was harassed, defamed, tortured,and eventually, on Feb. 9, 2015, murdered in this program."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"As neither Dr. Kilde nor her publisher were/are native English speakers, there are minor grammatica l errors in the text. To make the text read more smoothly, I occasionally add additional words, which I place in parentheses. In her book, Dr. Kilde does not specify where she obtained this instruction manual or who authored it. However, as Chief Medical O fficer for Northern Finland, she was an “insider” who was invited to many open and secret conferences. Her husband was also a political insider. Thus, she was privy to top - secret documents. Doubtless, she does not divulge the author(s) of this document in order to protect her informant(s). I note that many phrases and spellings are peculiar to the British form of the English language. This could reflect Dr. Kilde’s spelling and usage patterns. OR, it could reflect the fact that the original document was wri tten by British military - intelligence operatives. If so, we may speculate that it was authored by an individual or group associated with the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, which grew out of the Psychological Warfare Division of the British Army at the close of World War I and has, for decades, been the world’s “brainwashing center.” Regardless of its exact authorship, this is an extremely important document that should be read and understood by all “targets.” Clearly, this is a manual for psycholog ical warfare that presents the methods by which an extremely complex military - secret service hierarchy surveilles, punishes, “neutralizes” and ultimately murders its designated “targets.” There are obvious comparisons to be made with the CIA’s KUBARK tortu re manual, which has been employed in Vietnam, Latin America, the Middle East, and indeed, in CIA “black sites”/”extraordinary rendition” centers throughout the entire world. The psy - war system described herein bears a remarkable similarity to the operatio ns and procedures of the U.S. military’s “Fourth Generation Warfare”/”Civil - Military Operations”/”Military Operations Other Than War”/”Unconventional Warfare”/”Asymmetrical Warfare”/”Psychological Warfare” and “Information Warfare” operations as detailed i n Rich’s “New World War: Revolutionary Methods For Political Control.” (See Appendices 2 and 3 for a comparison of key terms in each program.) Indeed, the systems are identical. The remarkable revelation provided here is that modern organized gang stalking operations are identical with, or nearly identical with, those used in the FBI’s secret COINTELPRO (counter - intelligence program) of the 1950s - 1970s, the top - secret “Gladio” and other “Stay Behind Army” operations of Europe between 1950 and 1990, and the destabilization and citizen - elimination operations now being carried out in the name of “counter - terrorism” by the U.S. military in approximately 140 of the world’s 195 nations (see The World is the Battlefield, US SOCOM Involved in 134 “Counter - Terrorism” Wars ). Thus, we can properly understand the global organized gang stalking operations (which I refer to as GOG’s NeW GESTAPO for Global Organized Gang Stalking Neuro - Warfare Groups Electronic Slavery, Torture and PsyOp Operations) as a major component of the phony Global War on Terrorism and the “Full Spectrum Dominance” strategy of the Anglo - American - Israeli Empire. Welcome to the New World Order Antichrist - fascist - communist totalitarian police state in which the “battlespace” is the entire world and “you” are the enemy."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Further details regarding the advanced technologie s now being used in covert global Organized Stalking/Electronic Harassment operations are provided in Appendix 4 (from Total Individual Control Technology by O minsense.

GENERAL Operations in general are of the “active surveillance” type. Passive surveillance is watching a target covertly, to obtain information about the target. Active surveillance can include information gathering, but i t (also) includes the agent making the target aware they are under surveillance. Beyond active surveillance, agents perform acts to keep the target uncomfortable, around the clock. Although operations are silently approved of, and covered for by the offici al justice system, (they are not) seen as criminal in nature by citizens who do not have a strong sense of right and wrong. Agents must take great care that each and every act of punishment is DENIABLE. This means that should the target complain to police, (or) any other officials, or friends, neighbors, family members, or doctors, the nature of the punishment must be seen as the target’s “overactive imagination” or better yet, an indication the target is mentally ill. (The system) has worked for years to r ecruit the medical establishment to help maintain deniability, and today, most targets (are) immediately labeled as mentally ill and often forced onto anti - psychotic medication when they complain. But their agents must still do their part skillfully (to) p erform acts of punishment, so (that) almost anyone the target complains to will deny a crime against the target has taken place. As an agent, you will be trained in how to do this. (The system) has been blessed with advanced technology which enables heavy punishment at times the target is in their home, silently, through walls, and this is very deniable. Agents must pass their initial training and demonstrate a high level of commitment to maintain community safety, and the ability to operate deniably, befor e they will be considered for advanced electronic punishment training. Electronic punishment training is beyond the scope of this manual. The organization is very fortunate in that we have been able to recruit top specialists to back up field operations pe ople. Psychologists are the key to find(ing) ways to maximize feelings of stress and hopelessness in the target, and degrading the target’s health, from many individual “minor” invasive punishment acts. Technician’s in all fields -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"telecommunications, elect ric power, building electrical and alarm systems, and utility employees in all fields use their positions to inflict many absolutely “normal - looking” problems on targets on an ongoing basis. And of course, the services of many skilled locksmiths are invalu able in this. As a community - based agent (CBA) you will have the privilege of working with a team capable of delivering better “justice” than the official system . 2. SURVEILLANCE Surveillance is the foundation of all operations. Both community - based agent (CBA) visual surveillance and advanced electronic surveillance are used. This chapter will cover only local agent visual surveillance. Your local lead agent will schedule surveillance watches for each target in that community. Every target will have at le ast one CBA watching them (at) all times, even while at home and asleep. Each CBA surveillance team will be given a cell phone number for reporting target actions and movement to the local Control Center (CC). Actions to be reported include, but are not li mited to: Target turns lights on to start the day . Target uses toilet or showe r Target exits residenc e Target drives awa y Target arrives at work, o r Target shops or visits any other establishment or location . Target arrives hom e Target eats meal, at home o r in restauran t Target engages in sexual activit y Target turns lights off at the end of the da y Target turns light on in the middle of the nigh t Target travels out of town Some of these observations will be performed by the Electronic Corps (EC), but CBA’s should attempt to make and report as many detailed observations of target activity as possible. The reason such detail is necessary is that the punishment phase of active surveillance r equires that supervisors customize each punishment action to match the personality of (the) target, and the need to make each punishment action appear to be “life’s normal breaks.” One important punishment function of surveillance is to sensitize the targe t. Targets are never told they are under surveillance or being punished. Instead, close, active surveillance and other activities, happening far to frequently to be written off as “life’s normal breaks,” will eventually cause the target to realize they are under surveillance and punishment."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"As a community - based agent (CBA), you will be given specific instruction(s) on exactly when, where, and how to carry out punishment actions. As long as you carry out punishment instructions exactly as given, there is no way the target will be believed if they complain, and you will not be exposed to risk of action by law enforcement. How well the punishment actions work depends on how accurate and complete your reports are in many situations(. The) Control Center (CC) acq uires access to properties or apartments immediately next to the target’s homes or apartments. Because EC (Electronic Corps) has through - the - wall surveillance and punishment equipment, they will be reporting target activity along with community - based agent s. In a typical setup, CBA’s may be posted in a parked car where the target’s home or apartment can be observed overnight, for example. In this setup, the CBA in the car may be instructed to call, using walkie - talkie - style cell phones, another CBA (or team ) waiting or patrolling by car nearby to follow the target, or, you may be assigned to follow the target yourself. You will receive instructions from your local center as to following the target. Targets in transit may be either covertly or visibly followe d. When in doubt, hang back a bit, and contact the center for instructions, as targets in transit can present many unanticipated situations. The Center will always have the target’s position monitored, so if a target gives the CBA the slip, it will assign other appropriate community based agents to pick up the target at the earliest opportunity. Be sure to notify (the Control Center) immediately if you lose the target. When applying the visible following of a target, making the target uncomfortable because of your presence, you will be given instructions as to when to break off the following. Another CBA or CBA team may pick up the visible following, but once you have broken away, they advise that you are clear and ready for the next assignment. 3. INTERCEPT S Intercepts are where community - based agents (CBA) will appear to “just coincidentally” cross paths, on foot, with the target. Once the target has been sensitized to the point of realizing they are under surveillance and punishment, they will recognize, a nd be made appropriately uncomfortable by, the simple act of multiple CBA’s “just happening to” cross paths with them. Your local control center will instruct you as to how you will be cued to perform an intercept. Often you will have an on - site supervisor (OSS) position you, and give you hand signals as to when to start your movement to intercept the target. Because targets moving about aren’t always totally predictable, the success of CBA intercepts depends heavily on the Electronic Corps who have means o f monitoring the exact whereabouts of every target, and through computer programs, predict exactly when and where a target will be as they move about the community. Your local OSS has a special means of receiving instant, silent instructions for the Center ."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1. Intercepting CBAs may be asked to perform one of the following forms of intercept: 2. Simple path crossing, requiring the target to take evasive action to avoid collision, multiple CBAs sometimes perform this several times during a single outing by a target. On foot, walking for an extended period on the opposite side of the street from walking target. 3. Arriving at a place known to be a favorite of the target, and simply occupying that place just as the target is about to arrive (restaurants, parks, public facility seating, even bus seats are examples); sometimes just “hanging out” in such a location at times and places where people don’t ordinarily do that. 4. Smoking, coin - jingling, whistling, or toe - tapping near the target at a location where the t arget is known to need to stand, as to wait for the bus, or standing right behind a target at a water fountain. 5. A group, as many as a dozen CBAs, may be assigned to arrive at a store just ahead of a target, and form a queue ahead of the target, spending time buying lottery tickets, to delay the target. (The target) is very tired and eager to get home after work, for example, or in a hurry. 6. Community - based agents may be assigned to leave a next door home or apartment exactly the same time as the target , repeatedly. Alternatively, a CBA may intercept the target a short way before home and arrive at exactly the same time as the target. While these may seem like trivial acts, keep in mind that the target will have these “trivial” things happen every single day, and repeated intercepts like these will force the target to always watch for such acts, essentially ensuring the target never “has a nice day.” This is the goal, to ensure the target’s punishment. Similar intercept operation s are performed with vehicles. The Center can schedule these every day the target commutes, and both to and from work. Vehicle intercepts are particularly effective when the target sees the same vehicle in an intercept convoy both in the morning and in the evening commute. (Because vehicle intercepts can be dangerous, CBA assigned to vehicle intercept duty must successfully complete a special training course prior to actual assignment.) Here are some examples of vehicle intercepts a community - based agent (C BA) can expect to be assigned. - Parking so as to prevent a target’s leaving a parking area, and then disappearing. - Parking commercial vehicles often, near target’s home with something unusual about these vehicles, such as there is no need for that trade, or just unmarked white vans to make the target think the van is there to conduct surveillance. - Simple following, or leading, a short distance, but every day. Doing this, both during target commutes and then other times makes the target very uncomfortable."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"- Passing as side street stop sign, then stopping an uncomfortable distance into oncoming traffic just as target is about to arrive at the side street, causing the target to have to slam on the brakes (this requires Control Center assistance and prompting by walkie - talkie style cell phone. - For a CBA vehicle convoy, boxing in the target during a commute, forcing the target to travel at a lower speed than the target wants to travel. In some locations, the Center will supply special license plates to CBA vehi cles with short words which have special meaning to the target. - For a CBA convoy, and where the target is at a location (and time) where traffic is normally very sparse, cause heavy traffic, forcing the target to notice. The ultimate vehicle intercept is the staged accident. This can be dangerous and is only assigned to very senior agents. However, it is possible to stage an accident so only the target knows it was staged. This is an excellent means of punishment where a target has committed a serious offe nse specifically against secret services by revealing their criminality to the public. Generally, staged accidents are done in jurisdictions where police strongly support the operations, so that the CBA driver is protected. 4. PHYSICAL SABOTAGE Physical sabotage is an especially effective form of punishment when it is carefully limited to low value items, below the value where police will take the report seriously. For example, burning a target’s house down, or even stealing an expensive applianc e, would bring official investigators into the picture, so that is not done. Sabotage producing extreme safety hazards is generally not suitable for operations, because of the potential for bringing official investigators to an accident scene. So while dam aging the brake system of a target’s vehicle is not allowed for community - based agents (CBAs), draining some of the oil, transmission fluid or radiator antifreeze is allowed, but not all of it. The goal is to make it looks as if the target is negligent in maintaining fluid levels, and generally not causing a catastrophic failure that non - targets might see as sabotage. It is very important to apply punishment by way of a large number of small value sabotage acts, because that makes it look like the target is forgetful, exaggerating, or in some cases even delusional, if they complain about many cases of small value damage. The target’s associates will simply refuse to believe that anyone but the target is responsible. Sabotage is very important in that it lets the target know they are totally helpless to stop it, and can’t even complain about it effectively without appearing mentally ill. (The) organization (is) very fortunate in that some people, hearing about sabotage from a target did the sabotage themselves , “to get attention.”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Sabotage is applied at the target’s home, workplace, and on their vehicle. This requires the assistance of locksmiths and alarm technicians. Your local Control Center will supply this help, and will bring specialists in from a distanc e in the case of rural areas. Here are some examples of sabotage a community - based agent (CBA) may be assigned to carry out: - Entering a vehicle, or home, and changing control and radio settings . - Replacing window washer fluid with water, possibly destroyi ng the system in winter . - Scratching the paint on the target’s vehicle, scratching furniture and valuables . - Tire sabotage, from removing some air right up to slashing a sidewall if authorized by the Center . - Simulating a break in electric window heater st rips . - Cutting off the 4 - way flasher button . - Removing substantial amounts of oil, transmission fluid or antifreeze but not enough to cause catastrophic failure . - Moving things around inside the vehicle to show the target someone got in . - Unlocking the veh icle and leaving it unlocked, possibly even with door open . - Small cuts to car’s upholstery . - Unlocking the target’s front or back door and leaving it ajar while the target is away, even at midnight at New Year for Y2 hour . - Moving furniture or carpets aro und fairly frequently to show the target someone was there . - Stealing low - value items, especially items like scissors which can be easily misplaced, keeping them until the target replaces the item, then return the missing item, often in a place the target checked . - Stealing important papers, especially those which will cost money to replace . - Stealing irreplaceable photographs . - While target is at work, remove mail from their box and toss it around. Repeatedly making wall pictures crooked . - Setting clocks t o the wrong time . - Repeatedly dumping consumable supplies (e.g. coffee) to make the target think they are no longer capable of managing their supplies well . - Starting small rips in new clothing, which are widened on repeated visits . - Ripping crotches out o f the target’s underwear, or stealing finest underwear, swim suits, etc . - Replacing clothing with similar items which are too small for the target, like for children what target does not have . - Ironing inside button flags over, making buttoning the shirt o r top difficult . - Carefully working the tip of a knife through seams in any air mattress or cushion the target may own, including replacements, on a daily basis . - Breaking zippers in clothes and bags, perhaps by pulling out a tooth or two . - Shoving a knife through the soles of waterproof boots . - At work, removing screws from the target’s office chair, or at home dinner table leaving only one screw of four, left to tilt the table with china ."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"- At work, damaging or destroying (if not extremely obvious) a targe t’s work from a previous day, (for example), the computer is broken again possibly worse . - At work, replacing current copies of computer files with an older copy - particularly serious if target is a computer programmer . - At work, where some employees are o r can be recruited to be community - based agents, set up “mistaken deliveries” of heavy goods which block the target’s office . - At work, if the target is responsible for parts of the operation which can be sabotaged, do so repeatedly just as the target star ts eating lunch, or is about to leave for home . - At work where the target is responsible for materials (that) can’t be locked up, sabotage or with special permission from the Control Center steal the material. Thefts have to be carefully considered and aut horized by your local Center, unless you have authorization, do not steal. One particularly effective type of theft is to remove small value, but often used items from the target’s premises. Once the target has been observed purchasing a replacement, the i tem is returned. This not only causes the target to spend money uselessly, (it also) imposes a feeing of total helplessness on the target. 5. SABOTAGING THE TARGET’S REPUTATION Sabotaging the target’s reputation - and all that goes with it, such as ability to earn a living, business and personal relationships - is a very special operations category. Newer community - based agents will not be assigned to “engineer” the method, but will assist in passing “rumours,” which are the main means of destroying a target’ s public image. “Rumours” consist mainly of lies. However, in order to secure cooperation of specific members of the community to participate in the punishment phase, additional information keyed to appeal to the patriotic or community service sense of suc h community members may be used as well. As mentioned earlier, the organization has many top psychologists and psychiatrists on permanent staff at headquarters, and some in larger population centers. It is their responsibility to design the campaign to des troy the target’s reputation. These people listed below can be approached and given information which will cause them to make the target’s association with them uncomfortable, or break off all contact with the target. - Business contacts . - Supervisors . - Co - workers . - Casual social contacts, such as clubs a target may be a member of, or a group that frequents a bar where the target is a patron . - Friends . - Local fraternal organizations - they are motivated by the public service, and are an excellent source of as sistance in keeping the target under surveillance, and participating in the punishment phase as well . - Store staffs at places the target shops ."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"- Target’s landlord . - Target’s neighbors . - Tradesmen who are likely to service the target’s home, car, or busines s . - Bus drivers on the target’s route . - Local children . - City employees, including emergency medical technicians, ambulances . - Homeless shelter staff and residents where applicable . - Family members (surprisingly, many are ready to believe negative informat ion. ) - Especially, personnel at places the target applies for work. How intensely (these sabotage operations are carried out) is governed mainly by the need to prevent the target from (learning) that the negative rumors are being spread. The goal is to kee p negative information covertly flowing into the community, in such a way that those receiving the information aren’t likely to tell the target. One might think that friends and family members would instantly notify the target and side with the target. For tunately, experience shows that co - opting friends and family is surprisingly easy, once they are informed about the target’s criminal record. The Headquarters staff have developed techniques which by and large prevent that, but those techniques are beyond the scope of this manual. Suffice it to say that it is possible to apply “incentives” which cause even people closest to the target to cooperate. These incentives are applied by specialists from our organization at higher than the local level. For the comm unity - level CBA, the work of sabotaging the reputation of the target takes the form of simply carrying out instructions from your Control Center as to what you say to whom, how, and when. 6. DISCREDITING TARGETS While the powerful silent support of operati ons by the justice and psychiatric systems has been sufficient to prevent the target from informing the public, the area of discrediting targets is an ongoing activity. Like sabotaging the target’s reputation, discrediting their public statements, web site s, media appearances, letters to the editor and the like are done under the supervision of psychologists and psychiatrists on their staff. If a community - based agent (CBA) has a good track record of intelligently carrying out assignments, and has access to a computer, the CBA may apply to the local Control Center for assignment to discredit work. Excellent communications skills are required. Some of the activities CBAs carry out under supervision are: - Monitoring message boards, Wogs, and open media like In dy media for target posts. This is normally done in special shifts and under scheduling and control at a higher level than your local CC. This monitoring is assisted by blog scanning software which will detect and instantly flag posts relating to activitie s. The CBA doing this work will immediately reply with comments like “Someone isn’t taking their medication” or “target name” has provided absolutely no evidence.” The CBA will then report the post to higher level supervisors for possibly more detailed res ponses."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"- Monitoring newspapers in your area for letters to the editor regarding activities. Most editors and many reporters have been recruited and are willing to assist in keeping the important work of monitoring and neutralizing quiet, but once in a whil e, a letter to the editor will slip through. In this case, comments like “Someone isn’t taking their medication” are not an appropriate response. Transcribe and forward such a letter to the editor to the supervisor, along with your proposed response. The s upervisor may edit your response, and will assist in ensuring your response is printed. - Your supervisor will have staff monitoring upcoming talk show appearances by targets. While most talk show hosts, even those somewhat sympathetic to targets, have rece ived discrediting information and often will not host targets, some targets do manage to get on the air. In this case, your supervisor will assign you to call in to the show, and instruct you as to appropriate things to say, such as rebutting the target’s claims, pretending to be a target calling and making “wacko” statements such as “UFOs are harassing me,” or pulling the discussion away from real activities and to something like “media mind control.” - Agents who have excellent persuasive communication ski lls can be assigned, with careful coaching and preparation from supervisors, to pretend to be a target and get on talk shows known to air targets as the guest. These opportunities are great ways to discredit targets by talking about UFOs, things like black helicopters following you, foil beanies, satellites “parked” just above your home, and perhaps events normally considered “paranormal” like seeing (things that) appear and disappear. These discrediting topics must be a total surprise to the host, only men tioned after the show is in progress. - CBA can “casually” describe the “odd behavior” exhibited by the target as a result of around the clock activities to the target’s neighbors. The idea is to focus the neighbors’ attention to the target’s behavior, hint ing that maybe the target is mentally ill. This is easy once the target has developed suspicion that “everyone is out to get” him or her. It is a special “honor” for CBAs to be chosen for target discreditation work. 7. TRADE - RELATED PUNISHMENT This section will give some examples of ways community - based agents (CBAs) with specific trades or situations in the community can apply deniable punishment to targets. - Underground utility crews, where the management has been recruited, schedule messy, no isy maintenance at the target’s home (or business if the target runs a business). This can include having the street torn up for extended periods, or repeatedly. Fundng for unneeded work is available from headquarters. Taxi drivers can delay arriving when called by the target, especially when going to the airport. - Bus drivers have leeway, in nasty weather for example, to stop one stop away from awaiting target and wait there for perhaps 5 minutes, ostensibly to “get back on schedule.” This can also cause a target to miss connections with the next bus or train. This"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"is especially effective when the target, exposed to bad weather, can see the bus waiting up the street for no apparent reason, or not stopping at all at your bus stop. - Repair trades people can k eep “getting it wrong” necessitating many recalls, be late, be messy, over - bill the target, and even damage things which were OK. This is especially effective in the automobile repair trade. - Medical lab technicians can substitute blood samples, or otherwi se falsify results making the target appear to have absolutely no reason for their complaints. - Police can frequently pull the target over for frivolous reasons. - Telephone and cable TV technicians can re - route legitimate calls to the target’s number in la rge numbers, and this will cause the target to get very angry with these totally innocent callers. - Store staff where the target shops frequently can be instructed to remove items the target is known to need when a target is known to be coming. Store manag ement can stop ordering a target’s favorite items. - Restaurants and food delivery services can tell the target they are out of an item known to be a favorite of a target. The key to successful punishment by trades people is that while the target is very li kely to know they are being punished, these punishment acts must appear to the general public as “life’s normal breaks.” 8. TARGET’S HOME Punishing the target at the target’s (home) is essential for effectiveness of secret service operations. If the target were punished in the community but was allowed sanctuary in their home, the creation of a “prison without walls” would not be complete. One of the very first things the Control Center (CC) will arrange is for homes or apartments adjacent to the target’s h ome to be occupied by both community - based agents (CBAs) and members in the Electronic Operations manual. Because operations are carried out 24/7 in shifts, homes and apartments which are leased or owned by staff are not used as dwellings. The lease or dee d will bear either an entirely false name, or the name of a senior staff member whose actual home will be at a different location. Some adjacent homes or apartments are occupied by neighbors of the target who have offered to cooperate in punishment of the target. The initial contact of neighbors to determine their willingness to cooperate is done by senior staff, and incentives to cooperate are often tendered. Here are some commonly used punishment activities which are carried out both by CBAs and cooperati ng neighbors of the target. Activities are rotated among the choices, but at least one of them is applied daily:"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"- Noise. Noise must be of a type which the general public deems “normal.” Remember that the goal is to have the target aware they are being puni shed, but not be able to convince anyone else that that is the case. Observe local noise curfews, but plenty of punishment can occur outside noise curfew times. The target must not have easy cause to involve law enforcement. Examples: - Start leaf blower, t imes precisely when the target attempts to enjoy their yard, or when EC operators cue the CBA that the target is trying to nap. - Loud music from neighboring home. This is an excellent action, as it is common. Time it so every time the target opens a window the music starts. The timing makes the point it is intentional punishment. EC operator can apply music in adjacent apartments with exceptionally powerful bass, directed at the target’s unit. - Frequent squealing of tires near target’s home. - In apartments, frequent drilling into a scrap of wood or masonry held against the target’s wall, floors or ceiling as if “working.” Alternatively, hammering. Especially effective when cued by EC operators that the target is attempting to nap. - Tossing golf or tennis bal ls against the target’s home when the target is known to be trying to fall asleep. Ideal for cooperating neighbor children. - Frequent use of sirens near the target’s home. Many emergency services employees have a strong sense of community service and willi ngness to cooperate in this, or by people posing as Jehovah’s Witnesses. - Knocking on the door for frivolous/nonsensical/wrong address reasons. Especially effective when the target is in bed or having a meal. - Trash. Leave trash in the target’s yard. Frequ ently, but CC staff will assist in scheduling this so that the target can’t quite have a case on which law enforcement will act. - Terrifying the target’s pet. This requires entry while the target is away from home for an extended period and must be schedul ed by CC. Electronic Corps (EC) operators can render a dog or cat passive for safe entry of the community - based agents, by electromagnetic beam. - Wounding or killing the target’s pet. Rarely used, scheduled when the target has acted in a way so as to deser ve special punishment, like divulging the name of a criminally acting secret agent. - Killing domestic animals or wildlife and leaving them on the target’s doorstep. Scheduled when the target has acted in a way so as to deserve special punishment."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"- Where the target owns substantial land, noxious activities can be arranged and built for next to the property. In one case, a dump, an auto race track, and a prison were built adjacent to a target who owned a large farm in an area of natural beauty. While this is rare, it does illustrate commitment to delivering punishment to those “deserving” of it. - Cooperating police departments can visibly watch the target’s home. Possibly being parked in front of the home when the target returns, repeatedly. Police of ficers who refuse to take complaint of harassment and sabotage of the target, who they label “disturbed” – really are NOT allowed to make diagnoses, as only medical doctors can do, but may get a raise - price - for their unlawfulness afterward. Police follow orders by e.g. Stay Behind, Secret Military - led organization, created by the CIA after WWII in NATO countries. They give orders in secrecy to police, media, legal system, and judges, etc. Thus, being above parliaments and governments as demonstrated, for example, in Norway when in 1957 the Chief of “Stay Behind” Sven Ollestad gave the security code of Norway to MI6 (British Intelligence) in the UK acting on his own! “We have to trust our allies,” he had said. Today, the security code of Norway is kept in W ales. Originally, Stay Behind was created with good intentions to fight communism. Today it is out of control, and a new, much bigger Stay Behind 2 is active in Norway. The Stay Behind logo resembles the NATO logo. In Italy, Stay Behind was called Gladio 2 and dealt with terrorism secretly in Western Europe. It was responsible, for example, for the kidnapping and killing of Prime Minister Aldo Moro in 1978, while the blame was pinned on the Red Brigade. Today, enemies are communists and NATO (is the) opposi tion. On November 22, 1990, the European Union forbade Operation Gladio, but although Norway follows most EU decisions, this one is omitted. Italy and Belgium had terror actions by Stay Behind, and when the organizations (ceased to exist, the terror operat ions also ceased to exist). In Norway, Stay Behind is called E14. What was its role in Norway’s terror actions, if any? Some have tried to get control of Norwegian Stay Behind (armies) already years ago.

Appendix 2. Key Terms from Rich (2011) and Equivalencies with Terms Presented in Kilde’s “M anual For Gang Stalkiers” Terrorism - The US and its allies will terrorize the civilian population to achieve political objectives. The DOD stated: “Some IW activities, such as terrorism and transnational crime, violate international law. US law and nationa l policy prohibit US military forces or other government agencies (OGAs) from engaging in or supporting such activities. However, since our adversaries employ terrorism and transnational criminal activities against the interests of the United States and it s partners, these activities are included... as examples of the range of operations and activities that can be conducted as part of IW (Information Warfare).” 4GW – Fourth Generation Warfare - is a form of political/information warfare waged against civilians by a state or other entity. It utilizes civilians and the military, indeed all of society, to target civilian adversaries (aka “domestic state enemies,” “insurgents,” extremists, non - state actors, “cells of fanatics,” citizen “terrorists”) who value natio nal sovereignty and/or pose some perceived threat to the state’s interests. Anyone disseminating information contrary to the state’s (“national security”) interests may become an enemy. The goal of the New War is the psychological collapse of the new enemi es using a combination of tactics. Defeating the new enemies involves the synchronized use of non - lethal directed energy weapons, isolation, deprivation, and PsyOps against individuals and groups (aka TA, target audience and TI, targeted individuals). 4GW is more or less synonymous with unconventional warfare (UW), irregular warfare (IR), asymmetric warfare (AW), low - intensity conflict (LIC), military operations other than war (MOOTW), and network - centric warfare (NCW). This new war involves international, interagency cooperation between the military, federal and local law enforcement, non - governmental organizations (NGOs), intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), the civilian population/private voluntary organizations (PVOs), and private government contracto rs. This multinational force (MNF), involving NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the UN, is termed civilian - military operations (CMO). TI – targeted individual (insurgents, non - state actors (NSAs), dissidents, terrorists, asymmetrical threats, i rregular threats, potential enemies, etc.) Insurgents – those who try to persuade the populace to accept political change. The enemy does not necessarily use violence to promote social change. Their methods may be nonviolent. These are groups of individual s not under government control, against the established leadership, who will be targeted because of an action they might take in the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"future. These may include nonviolent protesters who are labeled as terrorists. They may ‘wrap themselves in nationalism.’CM O – Civilian - Military Operations - combines military, federal agencies, NGOs, civilian organizations and authorities, and the civilian population. CMO is used in friendly, neutral, or hostile operational areas, including populated civilian areas in which no other military activity is conducted. It is used to deal with domestic threats in the New War. The controlling faction of these PsyOp/CMO activities includes the military, federal agencies, NGOs, regional organizations, and international organizations tha t work with civil authorities. (In the US, this means the controlling faction is FEMA, DOJ, CIA, and other federal agencies (FBI, DHS, etc.). Civilians are used as irregular forces. CMO are interagency and global in nature. In the US, they are used as part of Homeland Security. CMOC – Civilian - Military Operations Centers - is established in the civilian sector for exchanging ideas. It may be a physical meeting place or a virtual one through online networks. Daily meetings are attended by representatives of t he military, NGOs, the private sector, and local officials. Discussions at these meetings may include any ongoing campaigns against domestic threats in the area of operation.C4ISR - Command, Control, Communications, Computer Center that utilizes Intelligenc e Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Multiple interacting components of C4ISRs include battlespace monitoring, awareness, understanding, sense making, command intent, battlespace management, synchronization, and information systems. C4ISR centers can be mobi le or stationary, or virtual, or strictly computer - based. Each military service has its own tactical mobile C4ISR system; The Navy and Marines use ForceNet, the Air Force uses Command Control Constellation (C2 Constellation), the Army uses LandWarNet and W IN - T. Each type of C4ISR system is connected to GIG (global information grid). CR – Cognitive Radio - (a kind of JTRS, or Joint Tactical Radio System) that consists of a computer which has AI (artificial intelligence). CR is an intelligent device that is aw are of itself, the needs of the user, and the environment. It can understand and learn. DARPA helped create CRs through programs like the Adaptive Cognition - Enhanced Radio Teams (ACERT), and Situation Aware Protocols in Edge Network Technologies (SAPIENT). GIG – Global Information Grid - developed partially by the MITRE Corporation, has been called DOD’s global C4ISR unit for netwar. It can quickly track down an adversary (target) anywhere on earth and attack them via DEW (directed energy weapons) and other forms of electronic warfare (EW). GIG uses existing commercial satellite and ground - based systems as well as GIG nodes such as aircraft, vehicles, and ships equipped with DR (JTRS). GIG is connected to all communications systems used by coalition and allie d forces. GWOT – Global War on Terror - use of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation warfare to achieve political/military objectives of the American Empire and New World Order. IO – Information Operation - aka “cyber war,” information warfare,” network centric warfa re (netwar, NCW) and command and control warfare (C2W)."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"In terms of activities of the internal enemy,” official sources suggest the act of simpoly conveying information alone can be described as IO. In this case, it is usually waged by people within oppres sed populations. In terms of government/military use of IO, DOD defines IO as: “The integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specific supporting and related capabilities, in influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own.” The 1999 “Air and Space Power Journal,” in an article called “What is Information Warfare?” states: Information Wafare is any action to deny, exploit, corrupt or destroy the enemy’s information and its functions; protecting ourselves against those actions and exploiting our own military information functions.” This new war is fought fo r political purposes and revolves around the issue of gaining the support and influence of the population . IW - Information Warfare - According to US Military and Defense Contractors, the “new enemy” use computers, the internet, fax machines, cell phones and public media to advance their objectives. They use “information operations” to influence state forces with the population. Various publications term the act of transmitting information “netwar,” “information operations,” “information warfare,” “informatio n attacks,” etc. Professor George J. Stein in “Information Warfare,” which appeared in Airpower Journal, stated: The target of information warfare, then, is the human mind.... The battle remains, the battle for the mind.” What all this means is that the New War is an information war. IO – Information Warfare - Infrasonic and ultrasonic weapons - Infrasonic and ultrasonic generators, also called emitters and VLF modulators, are weaponized devices consisting of a directional antennae dish which ca n send acoustic pulses to a general or specific area. In 1972 France was using infrasonic generators which operated at 7 Hz on its civilian population. By 1973, the British was using the Squawk Box in Northern Ireland. This directional weapon could target specific individuals by producing an audible sound at about 16Hz which turned into infrasound at 2Hz when it coupled with the ears. In early 1990s, Russia developed a 10 Hz VLF modulator adjustable up to lethal levels, capable of targeting individuals over hundreds of meters, causing pain, nausea, and vomiting. As far back as 1997, the US DOD has been creating generators in the infrasound and ultrasound ranges (7 Hz and 20 - 35 Hz, respectively) which can cause these same effects."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"These weapons can target the brain, causing changes in brain chemistry which influence thoughts and emotions. Particular frequencies and modulations will trigger precise chemical reactions in the brain, which produce specific emotions in the targeted individual. Infrasound - Occurs wi thin ELF range from a few hertz up to about 20Hz, which is the lowest limit of human hearing. From 1 to 250 Hz the pain/damage threshold seems to increase with frequency as well as power. Frequency determines what kind of damage occurs whereas power determ ines how much damage occurs. Infrasound easily passes through buildings and travels great distances. Natural examples include avalanches, earthquakes, volcanoes, and waterfalls. Whales, elephants, hippopotamuses, and rhinoceros use infrasound to communicat e over great distances.... For whales, hundreds of miles. An electronic example would be a large subwoofer. Infrasound is thought to be superior to ultrasound because it retains its frequency when it hits the body. From about 100 to 140 decibels infrasound c auses a variety of biological symptoms. Effects include fatigue, pressure in the ears, visual blurring, drowsiness, imbalance, disorientation, vibration of internal organs, severe intestinal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Higher power levels can liquefy bowel s, and resonate internal organs to death. It can also cause feelings of pressure in the chest, choking, irregular breathing patterns and respiratory incapacitation. High powered, low frequency sound from about 30 Hz to about 100 Hz (just beyond infrasound) causes fatigue, blurred vision, bowel spasms, pain or damage to internal organs, feelings of fullness in the chest cavity, chest wall vibration, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, choking and respiratory impairment. Psychological effects include loss of concentration, disgust, apathy, sadness, depression, fear, anxiety, and panic attacks. Micro - wave hearing - aka “synthetic telepathy,” “Voice of God,” and V2K, Existing radar units can be modified to transmit a beam of pulsed microwave energy into a person’s skull which causes sounds like ticks, buzzes, hisses, knocks, chirps, and words. The sounds originate from within, above, or behind the head and are transmitted to the inner ear via bone conduction (thermal expansion). (Bone conduction is anothe r pathway for sound transmission in humans and other mammals). There is no external noise. It can be applied from hundreds of meters away from a target using man - portable transmitters. Dr. Allen Frey invented the technology in 1958. The transmitters use pu lse - modulated waves at extremely low average power levels. In 1975, Dr. Joseph Sharp proved that correct modulation of microwave energy can result in wireless and receiverless transmission of audible speech."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"NLW - Non - Lethal Weapons - have also been called n on - injurious, disabling measures, immobilizers, strategic immobilizers, discriminate force, less - than lethal, pre - lethal, mission kill, new age weapons, soft kill weapons, slow kill weapons, silent kill weapons, limited - effects technology, neutralizing tec hnology, reduced lethality weapons, low - collateral damage weaponry, etc. DOD defines them as: “weapons that are explicitly designed and primarily employed so as to incapacitates personnel or material, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to person nel and undesired damage to property and the environment.... Non - lethal weapons employ means other than gross physical destruction to prevent the target from functioning.” They include biological and chemical warfare, directed - energy weapons, communications warfare, information warfare (IW) and psychological operations (PsyOp). Other types include Computer Attacks and Weather Modification. NLW are to be used in combination. The CFR states: “These weapons must be deployed coherently in synergistic coordination with information/psychological warfare technologies.” Similarly, NATO, in their 2004 and 2006 reports, “Non - Lethal Weapons and Future Peace Enforcement Operations” and “Human Effets of Non - Lethal Technologies” indicates that NLW should be used in combinat ion to increase their effectiveness. The US Military states that the goal is overwhelm the target by attacking all five senses, plus motor and cognitive functions. Neuroimaging Devices - Remote Neural Monitoring and Remote Neural Manipulation NLW - Non - Letha l Weapons - have also been called non - injurious, disabling measures, immobilizers, strategic immobilizers, discriminate force, less - than lethal, pre - lethal, mission kill, new age weapons, soft kill weapons, slow kill weapons, silent kill weapons, limited - ef fects technology, neutralizing technology, reduced lethality weapons, low - collateral damage weaponry, etc. DOD defines them as: “weapons that are explicitly designed and primarily employed so as to incapacitates personnel or material, while minimizing fata lities, permanent injury to personnel and undesired damage to property and the environment....

PO – Peace Operations - the new war (4GW, IR, UW, etc.) - aka “peacekeeping operations” by the UN, are international, interagency missions to contain co nflict, maintain peace, and form a legitimate government. Most are run by DPKO (Department of Peacekeeping Operations) of the UN. The US Army lists them as a type of MOOTW."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PolWar - Political Warfare - a translation of the German term, “weltanschuauugskrieg” (worldview warfare), which means the scientific application of terror and propaganda as a way of securing ideological victory over an enemy. PsyOp - Psychological Operations, a major part of the New War and a core part of CMO (civilian military operations) that is combined with EW (electronic warfare) and CNO. PO involve syngergistic coordination of PsyOp, MILDEC, OPSEC, and EBO. PsyOp units work with the civilian population as irregular forces to attack target audience (TA) in the area of operation (AO). P syOp operators profile TAs and TIs and devise themes to attack their TAs (target audience), which include TIs (targeted individuals). Ultimate goal of PsyOp is to modify the behavior of the TA by destroying their will using a relentless attack consisting o f painful triggers. A type of audiovisual product known as PsyAct includes agents of action who carry out plays in the presence of the TA. Every single channel of communication the TA uses for information is interfered with. PsyActs – psychological actions - aka “F2C” - are audiovisual products consisting of “agents of action” who deliver messages to a TA (target audience or individual). Agents of action follow a set of guidelines while “play acting” to deliver the messages. PsyActs usually utilize multiple p eople to transmit messages. Themes are presented in a performance similar to a play or movie production. (Hence, the term “surveillance role player”). Words like sets, props, performance, theatre, actors, cast, script, audience, etc. are used. The military sometimes actually employs people from theatre actor guilds and modeling agencies. PsyActs can occur during rallies, rumor campaigns, group meetings, lectures, theatre, plays, speeches, dances, banquets, fiestas, festivals, religious activities, talks wit h individuals during interviews on talk radio shows, and other social activities. Messages may be subtly transmitted during these events. Agents of action follow general scripts that can be modified as needed. This type of communication includes “key words ” or phrases spoken by the actors in the presence of the TA. PO - PsyOp - Psychological Operations, – US Military states that the ultimate goal of PO is to modify the behavior of the TA (TI) by destroying their will. This is brought about by continually infl icting pain. This is accomplished by a relentless campaign used to demoralize the TI that will create perpetual feelings of intense fear and hopelessness. The DOD describes this as an “attrition - based approach:” “Attrition is the product or gradual erosion of the will. The victim of this psychological attrition gradually becomes convinced that nothing he can do will yield a satisfactory outcome to a situation.” In PO, themes are used to transmit painful stimuli (also called triggers) through all his/her channels of communication which a TA (TI) has been sensitized to. Triggers/themes are understood at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of the campaign and they are passed to various commanders of particular AO if the TA moves towards that port ion of the battlespace."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The triggers are part of a behavior modification program called NLP (neuro - linguistic programming) which uses anchors and triggers to promote change. An anchor is created when an emotional state is linked to something such as an obj ect, person, sound, smell, place, color, etc. Once the anchor is established, whatever the individual was exposed to during the anchoring process becomes the stimulus (trigger) that will provoke the emotion. So basically, PO is simply a series of “stimulus - response” interactions. PO= aka or “information operations,” military deception (MILDEC), effects - based operations (EBO), neocortical warfare, political warfare (PolWar), and psychological warfare (PsyWar), aka command and control warfare (C2W), are a maj or part of the New War and a core part of CMO (civilian - military operations) that is combined with EW (electronic warfare) and CNO. Po’s are a planned process of conveying messages to a target audience (TA) to promote certain attitudes, emotions, and behav ior. These messages are typically conveyed using a line of persuasion known as a theme. TA (target audience) can be a group or an individual. PO involve syngergistic coordination of PsyOp, MILDEC (military deception), OPSEC (operations security), and EBO ( effects - based operations). And they are in MOOTW, CMO, IW, UW, LIC operations such as counterterrorism and peacekeeping. The DOD and CFR consider PsyOp a NLW to be used on civilians. PsyOp units work with the civilian population as irregular forces to atta ck target audience (TA) in the area of operation (AO). PsyOp operators profile TAs and TIs and devise themes to attack their TAs (target audience), which include TIs (targeted individuals). Ultimate goal of PsyOp is to modify the behavior of the TA by dest roying their will using a relentless attack consisting of painful triggers. A type of audiovisual product known as PsyAct includes agents of action who carry out plays in the presence of the TA. Every single channel of communication the TA uses for informa tion is interfered with. In “gang stalking/electronic harassment,” PsyOp is synchronized with EW (electronic warfare with directed - energy - weapons), CNO (computer network operations), and all other instruments of national power. The battlespace is your neig hborhood and the war is global. Early PsyOp research was done by a small private network of think tanks, foundations, and academic institutions, which went into partnership with government agencies and kept most of the results of their studies secret. Some of the institutions that conducted these studies were known to be subversive. Thus, much of the modern PsyOp was built by a small group of private interests, using the social sciences to install a global government. Some of these are the exact same groups promoting the use of PsyOp on civilians. RF – Radio Frequency Weapons"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Rumor Campaigns - used by PsyOp units to isolate TIs. Primary elements include the source, the rumor, and the receiver - repeater (R2). Similarly, the US Marine Corps document, “Multiple - S ervice Concept for Irregular Warfare” (2006) states: “frightening the population into inactivity is sufficient to (achieve) our goals.” TPD – Tactical PsyOp Detachment - team of about 13 personnel with a captain and staff sergeant. It is comprised of severa l TPT (Tactical PsyOp Teams) and provides tactical PsyOp support to brigade and battalion - sized units in support of Special Forces. TPT conducts mission assessment, determines distribution priorities, and tracks the various products that have been distribu ted throughout the AO. All teams maintain contact with each other. And the TPD is in constant communication with other forces such as the TPDD, POTF, or TPT during the entire operation. TPT - Tactical PsyOp Team - small group including team leader, his assis tant, and a PsyOp specialist. CNO - Computer Network Operations - aka NW Ops, or network operations/NetOps) are information warfare attacks used to deny, deceive, degrade, and disrupt networks and computers used by the enemy. These are used in conjunction wi th PO (PsyOps) and EW (electronic warfare). This includes destruction of hardware and software (degrading, attacking) and spoofing (deceiving). The battlespace includes the internet. Internet applications that can convey PsyOp messages include email, websi tes, and chat rooms. When a TI goes online, they are entering the battlespace. Web spoofing allows an attacker to create a copy of the worldwide web. The Air Force mentioned that an enemy’s internet could be spoofed to conceal one of its weather attacks: “ Spoofing options create virtual weather in the enemy’s sensory and information systems, making it more likely for them to make decisions producing results of our choosing rather than theirs.” DEW - Directed Energy Weapons - used to damage or destroy people, equipment, and facilities, include microwave, millimeter waves, lasers, bright lights, holographic projections, and acoustic weapons (audible, infrasound, and ultrasound). These weapons are silent and traceless. They cause a variety of effects, including t iredness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, convulsions, epileptic seizures, temporary paralysis, vibration of internal organs, cooking of organs, cataracts, burning sensation on the skin, hyperthermia (heating of body), headaches, loss of short - term memory, interruption of cognitive processes, cardiac arrest, and cancer. These weapons can easily pass through most unshielded structures. In their “Electronic Warfare” publication, DOD defines DEW as: “DE (directed energy) is an umbrella term coveri ng technologies that produce a beam of concentrated EM energy or atomic or subatomic particles. A DE weapon is a system using DE primarily as a direct"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"means to damage or destroy adversary equipment, facilities, and personnel. DE warfare is military action involving the use of DE weapons, devices, and countermeasures to either cause direct damage or destruction of adversary equipment, facilities, and personnel, or to determine, exploit, reduce, or prevent hostile use of the EMS through damage, destruction, a nd disruption.” DEW include microwaves, lasers, bright lights, holographic projections, and acoustics . The two basic types of DEWs include microwaves and lasers. (Wavelengths of lasers are about 10,000 times smaller than microwaves). Both are part of the e lectromagnetic spectrum. The two main types of microwave weapons are millimeter wave devices such as the Active Denial System (ADS) and the electromagnetic bomb (e - bomb, which is the emission of a non - nuclear electromagnetic explosion or pulse). DEW travel at the speed of light, are surgically accurate, can operate in all weather, are scalable, are silent and invisible (offering plausible deniability), their energy can pass through walls at distances of hundreds of meters to miles, and have long distance pr ojection (tens of miles). These weapons are mounted on platforms which can be a missile, aircraft, ship, vehicle, suitcase, radio, etc. Appendix 3.

OTHER TACTICS (Dr. Rauni Kilde) There are other tactics which are not strictly part of the categories discussed so far: - IMPORTANT: Community - based agents (CBAs) are strictly forbidden from adding anyone to the list of targets. Target sele ction is done by senior Control Center (CC) staff or higher levels . - Punishment of people who side with and help the target. Friends, family members, and citizens who do not place a high value on community sometimes help targets. In these very specific cas es, CC - authorized punishment in the form of individual acts against them is appropriate. The system can arrange for these target sympathizers to be found guilty of crimes, or liable for civil actions, for example. This is important for maintenance of the s ystem."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"- Target bank accounts can be disrupted in ways which do not give the target cause to involve law enforcement.
